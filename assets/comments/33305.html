        I have to say that I am heartily sick of ALL non-white immigrants.  Everywhere you turn it’s blacks, browns, yellows and noses shoved in your face – particularly on the boob toob.  Forty or fifty years ago, they were all more of a novelty – ethnic restaurants etc.  Now, they’re fricking everywhere, including substantial positions of power and influence.  I’m also resigned to the probable fact that whatever deportation scheme Trump and crew come up with, it won’t make much of a difference at all – we’ll just be subjected to endless videos of wailing illegal muds – with tens of millions of Whites thinking, how can be so heartless.  My God…

            The “diverse” ads are so friggin grating.  Though I almost never watch the boob-tube, I spend the time others spend watching TV watching youtube and it is every bit as bad.  Youtubers are constantly putting god-awful noise pretending to be music in their videos and it’s all African.  The (free) B-roll youtubers use is all loaded with diversity as well.
My area has been loaded up with Chinese and Indians along with all the mestizos.

                Accursed dieversity is everywhere. Not just Youtube and Boobtoob, but the placards on the walls of Walmart, the packaging of diapers and cat food, the websites where you conduct your banking and investing. And, as you say, every amenable format is yoked to insufferable racket manufactured by the pavement apes.There are three possible responses to this deluge of aesthetic filth. First, you can act like a Griller and pretend to like or at least accept it. Second, you can loathe it and simultaneously marinate in it, in which case you’ll go insane. Third, you can tune out to the best of your ability, although total abstention is impossible unless you to repose on a pole in the middle of the Mojave. Choice three is the unfailing hallmark of the Tradissident.

                    And what is it about these joints? They get into some storefront, then BLAST their fvcking music out into the street as if EVERYONE needs to hear it. Their simplistic, repetitive beat … Felice fuck off.

                And I actually like Mexicans. I definitely have a hierarchy, as Z said. Incompatibles such as Muslims, South Asians, and Africans are at the bottom for me.

                    Many whites share your fondness for aztecs. My case is different. I became conscious of race in coastal California where there were many revanchist aztecs who would tell you to your face that they wanted to take back their land from you. The supposed “good ones” did not defend all the whites who paid them to mow their lawns. Pleasant fantasies about shared conservative values were impossible.

                        How many Aztecs are there, though? The majority of what we consider Mexicans are Spanish influenced.

                            My experience leads me to guess that if you are having pleasant interactions with aztecs/hispanics/latinos it is only because they have not achieved sufficient numbers.
One of my most racially-charged memories is being the only non-aztec in a convenience store, less than an hour drive from San Fran, in which I was the only one who spoke English. The hatred was obvious.

                                I was doing a project for a large apartment complex a while back, and the site contact was an amiable guy from south of the border.When we met, he greeted me in Spanish and I ignored him. He asked,”what, you don’t speak Spanish”? To which I replied,”No, this is America”.
From that point forward, he spoke only in English to me.
Funny how that worked out.

                            Spaniards are European.  Though there are Spaniards in Mexico, the vast majority are either full or partial Indians/Aztecs or whatever.  All those short brown guys hanging at the Home Depot are not Spaniards.  They simply are not compatible with Western Civilization.

                            They don’t think so-they consider Aztlan to be the future.Regardless, most of the one’s moving here are from central and south central Mexico which is the nahuatl region of Mexico(heavy native stock).The ones on the novelas are probably from places like Argentina, Colombia or places in Mexico where they have German et al last names.

                        I’ve never been to California, and God willing, never will. That said, I get the sense that Cal-Mexicans are very different from Tejanos. The former are far more likely to fall in with the Left’s anti-white racism than are the latter, who in the main, don’t have any time for it.

                            You’ve expressed your feeling before that Tejanos are a different breed. It’s hard for me to imagine, but you’ve always struck me as a trustworthy and intelligent man. I’m not going to argue with your experiences, however improbable they seem to me. The world is a big, complicated place. I want to be an accurate observer and that requires humility.
I used to want to visit Texas, maybe visit Robert Howard’s home, but 3g4me has dissuaded me!

                                In my time at Camarillo, I met only four good spics — two worked at the 3M plant, and the husband/wife team that ran the Somis Cafe and Market. And I wouldn’t swear the latter were so much good as not wanting to lose a potential customer. Don’t know, but it is plausible, based on the character of all the rest I encountered.

                                Keep in mind that these observations are based on the mean.  So while Tejanos, on average, are not as insufferable as Mexicalians, that does not mean there are no insufferable La Raza type Tejanos.  But you will find far more Tejanos lean GOP (to the extent you can take that as an indicator of anything) than Mexicalians do.

            The usual people will whine and complain, but I suspect a lot of people will feel their hearts grow colder at the manipulation.  There will be that shock and awe phase of the anti-deportation initiatives…the media caterwauling…the sympathy pictures…But then people will see the deportations happening.  The NGOs will see their initiatives targeted and their lawyers and friendly judges neutered…and their funding will dry up.  Or if Homan gets his wish and starts jailing local politicians for harboring illegals.  In major cities like NY and Chicago – TdA isn’t just in that apartment complex in Denver – if people see those murderous savages getting shipped out, and the resulting calm that follows, hearts will harden.It’s almost hard to imagine how great this country would be with 30,000,000-50,000,000 fewer people in it.  But imagine just a few million and the effect that would have on the public psyche and watch how fast people get on board with that effort.  Shorter lines, cheaper housing and food, cheaper healthcare, everything benefits from ditching the freeloaders.I don’t know if it can be done, but the fact that we’re even talking about it is an earthquake in the culture.

                A great way to kick off La Gran Deportación would be to do what DeSantis and “Wheels” Abbot did just a few years ago but on steroids. Start rounding up token numbers of foreigners in smaller towns and cities, more likely to be Red zones. But more important: targeted groups would be aware that they could more or less freely travel to “sanctuary cities.” In fact, why not simply put the “apprehended” ones on the bus too? Yes, New York,Chicago, LA, all the Progressive Shitholes in short order have a seemingly unending stream of short brown people stepping off the Greyhound at the local stations, looking for their handout. Can you imagine the Progs screaming bloody murder? At some pointperhapsTrump might turn his attention to these deluged cities, but he should take his time, and let them get a good dose of what they’d preached, good and hard.

                The rent and housing situation was primed, even before the Brandon-instigated immigrant deluge, to become a crisis. The deluge was simply the thing that gotEVERYONEto notice the problem(s). Many parts of the country, such as Western Oregon, where I’m stuck, have a double-whammy combo of problematic geography and Leftist Greenie politics. Basically, this area’s housing supply is limited by nature in the form of mountains and hills too steep to build on and then by this thing the Greenies came up with called the “Urban Growth Boundary”. Basically the latter is an arbitrary perimeter around Portland outside of which you cannot build housing. This was always an incipient disaster but for many years there was plenty of land within the boundary and the housing supply more or less kept up with demand.Housing costs started creeping up around 2010 thanks to stupid shows like Portlandia which encouraged an influx of useless trustafarians and hipsters.Then came Brandon and the flood of migrants filled in the last spaces within the UGB. This is what ended the last hope for affordable housing in the area. The sensible thing to do of course would be to abolish or reform the UGB. The shitlib electorate of course, will not consider that and will continue to virtue signal by voting for more immigrants and no way for the housing stock to grow.Other parts of the country that have flatter terrain and a less fanatical anti-housing electorate largely avoided these problems until 2020 but Brandon’s tidal wave of third world trash has now swamped even them because you can only build houses and apartment complexes so fast.If the migrant flood can at least be halted, the saner (Red) parts of the country will eventually see the housing supply match demand and housing costs will return to normal. I actually think places like this will respond to the rising costs and crowding with evenmorefanatical virtue signalling and deliberate efforts toimportmigrant trash who are being thrown out of the saner parts of the US. My only real hope for the Trump administration is that he will at least halt the migrant flood allowing at least some parts of the country to recover and return to (almost) normal. Of course, even this will be an uphill fight and I can see that Musk and other oligarchs are going to have to be forced to accept even that.

        Two key takeaways from the Indian/H1b discourse:1)Notice how not one of the pro-slave labor surrogates has offered any sort of compromise to the American people.  They haven’t even bothered to address our concerns.  They simply insulted us by claiming we’re too lazy and stupid to understand and then prodded us with ridiculous questions like ‘Don’t you want the US to win?!?”  Of course, who’s actually winning is never discussed.2) In regards to Vivek’s anti-American culture rant: The Indian can’t compete in the physical realm.  It’s understandable they would resent the jock and the prom king as they are not a physical/athletic (See Olympic medal counts) nor aesthetic people.  They’re simply incompatible with our culture.I especially appreciated Z man on twitter standing up for the scholar/warrior ethos that is at the very core of Western culture.  Me and over half the starting lineup on my varsity baseball team were in honors and AP classes.  Noble, magnanimous chads must retake control…and fast.

            What is it they want the US to win at ?
The biggest area the US and Europe is losing at is immigration
If the US is falling behind in some tech area  its mainly down to poor leadership. Eg Boing, and Indian programmers are involved in that mess
If infinity immigration is so good for a country, why don’t China or Japan want it ?

        Much like our Canadian commentators, I live around Indians. We could all see this coming. Indians make Jews look subtle. And unlike Jews, Indians can’t pretend to be white, so whites notice them as the other.
This is nice little victory, but the Indians aren’t going to quit. They don’t give two farts about us or our feelings. America is the biggest, easiest scam opportunity in history. They will come for it.

                There is only so much scamming to be done. Once the money runs out, so does the scam.  God willing, the young people will learn from the mistakes of their elders at least.

        The average IQ in India is about 78…average IQ for white or Asian Americans, over 100…Indians are highly corrupt, often scammers like VIvek, and always want to hire their relatives and import more Indians….Meanwhile, highly qualified white Americans can’t even get an interview with major companies…..

            We were propagandized against the caste system too intensely. There is a reason higher caste subcons look down on the lower castes — they really are inferior.
We would probably be better off just formally and legally recognizing that our inner city yoots are our Dalits and get on with life.

                That’s been my impression. Makes sense that the more assimilated, Westernized Indians would be high-caste. The castes are, after all, genetic subsets with very little intermixing.

Your posts have declared that you’re the son of an immigrant who was bitter that we didn’t have anything better than a union carpenter’s job for Dad.I don’t think it’s asking too much that if we believe that thoughts create Americans that those thoughts not run along the lines of “I’m better than all these stupids”.

                A childhood friend of mine initiated me into hatred of Indians decades ago. She was a pioneer of it, absolutely rabid, back when few of us had met any Indians and learned how much weshouldhate them.She’s a rare Japanese-American, third or fourth generation. The first two generations of her family here owned and operated a few hotels in California. (Apparently that’s what Japanese people were brought here to do, be Californian hoteliers, for reasons I can’t quite put together.) When war internment came around, her family wasn’t imprisoned. In exchange for their freedom, their business was taken away from them…and given to Indians. Her family’s demotion from bourgeois to professional was permanent.There’s a lost history there, apparently. According to her, Indians were imported to America for this purpose, to take what was Japanese, and their hotel monopoly is a result of this—of their beingpolitically assignedit, as they’re now assigned “tech.”How true? It’s Japanese family lore, probably mostly bullshit. But it fits what we see (and my own sense that it’s been current_year for a hundred years).

                            Given all the bad things that happen in motels, including murder, I wonder how the typical seedy Pajeet motel family handles the, um, cleanup operations. Do they contact law enforcement and shut down for the day? Or do they apply the “Ganges river treatment” to the mess?
Don’t eat the curry at the breakfast bar. Hmm, sounds like the plot of a hilariously racist indy movie – “Weekend at Sanjay’s”

        When Trump started talking about stapling green cards to diplomas, I know a lot of people kind of put their fingers in their ears and waved it off as Trump just saying stuff. Well, that clearly was not the case and the people who hammered Trump on this were right to do so.The idea of mass deportations paired with infinity Indians (and that is what would happen, see Canada which is now completely destroyed) never made any sense. So a few weeks before Trump is taking office we are starting to see, from his team, some pullback from the mass deportation while they are doubling down on Infinity Indians. It would be infuriating if it wasn’t so predictable.

            If Trump really wants to do this mass deportation thing, he will have to ignore court orders and arrest people who interfere, including politicians. I have serious doubts that he will do any such thing.

                    Yes indeed. The nation needs a man of…steel you might say. What the Russians call a Сталин I think. He heh. Listening to the Lefties panic over Trump is funny. The country is so far gone at this point that it makes sense to wish they were right – internment camps, military rounding up migrants, purges of DIE staff (especially women) in corporations and government… If only. He’s not capable of that though. I don’t think we have many men who are.

I admit to still being guardedly optimistic. One of the few things Trump shares with George Washington is that his opinion is whatever his last advisor told him it should be. Which is why that Srignat AI guy needs to be opposed. You do not want anyone remotely like him to have Trump’s ear.
Though being as Trump is a left-wing loon from NY, I count my fingers constantly, and bemoan the fact that he was the best that could be elected.

                Trump was best that could get through a corrupt system where all is now currently tilted at enriching the elite. Trump’s 4 years will probably be the status quo. What happens when there is no Trump to run against the next Kamala Harris is more interesting.

                    It wouldn’t matter how corrupt the system is. There’s well over half the populace that worships Satan in the form of the State. The best anyone can do is find the softest cliff into which to crash-land, and hope there are enough left to pick up the pieces.

        I don’t recall anyone here, at least, throwing rose petals at Vivek’s feet. Even if I missed some outlier admiration, he pretty well finished himself off with this episode. Any government cut King Cobra now touts as part of DOGE will be suspect, which actually may be unfortunate, but them’s the breaks. L’Affaire Infinite Indians was a good reminder that the impulsivity of Indians, Jews, white leftists, and so forth has always been their Achilles Heel and it is one advantage we have over them. Note how other Subcons joined in the anti-white chorus with ever-increasing nastiness. Churchill did have a few good lines, one of which re the Germans was that they are either at your feet or at your throat. Replace Germans with South Asians and that’s spot on.The big loser here, I think, is J.D. Vance. His marriage and Hapa kids are now an even bigger liability. Musk always has been the most successful welfare queen in human history, so I don’t see him getting dinged much long term although his thin skin was put on display to an unusual degree. I think the most interesting actor was David Sacks, who after a point knew to cut his losses. That guy bears watching because he apparently does have impulse control. Vivek tried to follow Sacks’ lead but did so in a transparently phony manner.

            I have to say that I’m disappointed in King Coba. No, not in the sense that he betrayed us. He was never on our side. He was on his side. I’m disappointed in his terrible political skills. I always took him as a much better con man.
But I was hoping that he’d use his con man skills to help our side, not because he cared but because it could elevate him. This is a stunning own goal by the Cobra.

                    Exactly. He stepped in some pooh. Okay, that happens, but his actions after that were amazingly stupid politically. He could have exited the situation pretty easily.
Just say that he wants to end H1B but create a new “Genius visa” for 10,000 people or something like that. (Obviously, he’d never actually do that.) Instead, he decides that it’s a great idea to trash on Americans and American culture. Stunning.

                            I still cling to some hope for JD. If only because I can only swallow so many black pills in a day. Musk and Ramaswamy have exposed themselves as charlatans. As for the Donald, I just don’t know what to think of the man… very exhausting times.

                With all duerespect, he may be a con man when it comes to Whites, but he cannot escape his own genetics and ethnocentric culture – and fellow Indians know he is one of them.  For Whites to somehow trust anyone called “Vivek” to prioritize White interests, because it would also help is own political aspirations, is to once again ignore how he got where he is in the first place.

                    I never trusted him, except to trust that he wanted power and position. He (correctly) decided that Trump populism was a good wave to ride. I assumed that he understood what Trump supporters wanted – even if he didn’t care about it – and would play to that audience.
I was wrong about his skills. Perhaps, he didn’t understand that he can’t play the “My fellow whites” game like Jews can.

                        I thought it was obvious that Vivek was playing a role and exploiting it to the hilt but thought it might work as a scam because he did it quite well. My mistake was not factoring in the impulsive nature of the Indian, and that burned him down pretty quickly this week.

                    I went over to Breitbart a few mins ago to see whether they had a story about the Twitter dust-up and, if so, what the MAGA crowd had to say about it, expecting the cult of Trump to be on full display, favoring destroying the country in order to save it by sticking slavishly to whatever Trump and his minions want, but I am surprised to see that sentiment is 10 to one against importing more Indians. Maybe we are turning a corner somehow.

                        As Z-man pointed out, nobody has particularly favorable opinion of South Asians. They are notable for all the qualities that they lack relative to most of the world’s cultures. The best I have is “spiritual” and even that is wasted on Hinduism and the caste system. They are polite but only to get you to fill out those stupid surveys for help you could have gotten from a website. The list goes on.At least Africans can be entertaining or display a strength that Europeans lack.

                        Until the Twitter explosion over Indians I had thought that at least some of the oligarchs, with Musk and Theil as the vanguards, had an understanding of where we are in this country right now which is quite close to the day of Ceausescu’s last speech in Romania. The rage among normal White men, in particular, is close to the boiling point. Most of my fellow White techies, at least the younger ones, are abject cucks. There’s always been a large fraction of us though who have the martial spirit, have opposed DIE from the start, andwant ALL the damn Pajeets gone yesterday.Hearing Musk and Vivek tell us that, no, we won’t ever be getting our good jobs back and in fact will continue to be replaced, just by Sanjay rather than Pedro, is pretty close to the last straw.Musk can redeem himself by making an abject apology, perhaps throwing in a mention of his background in South Africa, and acknowledging that he made a huge mistake. Vivek basically needs to convince us better that he’s a race-traitor tohistribe. I doubt he would even know how to do that.

                I can’t believe he used “hanging out at the mall” as a gripe. He is not old enough to have hung out at the mall when that was a thing! It’s so disingenuous. Either he thought that would appeal to Americans because it’s a stereotype of the 80’s or it’s his father’s gripe that he inherited. It’s very strange.
I can almost picture his immigrant dad bitching about the American kids hanging out at the mall.

                        Well, evidently the generally happy and healthy American kids hanging out at the mall must have upset them.
The American kids also found opportunities to be with the opposite sex by hanging out at the mall. And ya know, they might breed more happy and healthy American kids and that must have really pissed them off. Can’t have that.

                            Yes. And the white teens also worked there, taking employment opportunities for those seeking a better life for themselves. The mall is a perfect metaphor for the absolute dung heap the United States now is.

                        That would have been 1995.  I never shopped at malls much, but back then – at least in Texas – I could take my older son to play at local malls and indoor play areas and see mostly White kids.  But when I tried to do that with the younger one in the early aughts, the places were over – run with subcons, hans, mestizos, etc. – and we found other places to go and things to do.

                            You know, that’s a very good point. The mall business isn’t doing very well these days. When you consider the fact that malls came about because of all the “diversity” in downtown shopping areas, their demise should have been predictable once diversity came to the mall. There are other factors for malls circling the drain, but I do think that’s one of them.

                    He does have a point, however. In fact, I’ve argued the same around here. Mike Rowe is just an actor. Dirty Jobs don’t get you a seat at the table where they decide whether we have to eat bugs or not. Vivek is just the wrong person to be making that argument.

                        Yes, we know you’ve argued the same here. That’s why I’ve invited to consider returning home. If you hate America and our values, then just don’t worry about us. So sorry we didn’t come up to those standards.All those dirty jobs, dangerous and highly technical that only white men seem to do, are the ones keeping you comfortable even as I type this.Our issue right now is an elite governing class that holds the values as your posts and Vivek. The point of such a class is to protect the interests of the working class. It’s not to mock them for doing their God given work.

                It may be disheartening, but I’m not surprised in the least.  Check any website and see magatards exulting that, after Trump, they look forward to 8 years of a Vance presidency (and a devout Hindu subcon ‘First Lady’).The women couldn’t emote enough about the man making his great-grandma’s biscuits with his mulatto daughter.  The man trashed his family and Appalachian heritage to paeans from the cloud people, and now every cuckservatard adores the man as some sort of ‘authentic American’ hero.

                        Scott doesn’t believe in God or religion. Doesn’t usually go out of his way to mock the faithful often, but when he does, it’s always Christians.
He also desperately wants to upload his brain into the cloud to “live forever.”
Doesn’t have any kids of his own. Fancies himself as smart as Elon and Vivek but the evil “racisms” kept him down.
That’s all you need to know about Scott. He’s not evil, but he’s ultimately incapable of appreciating transcendence.

                    I was against JD for that very fact. I simply don’t trust him because of what his sympathies would be.
I don’t know if this is correct or not, but it seems like Asian immigration skyrocketed under Zero. Zero had much fun this for that region and I’m sure he put his thumb on the scale.
That said, it’s hard to hate JD after watching this. He comes across as downright normal:https://youtu.be/yr0aZk2fmDM?feature=shared

            JD was always disgusting with his “interfaith” marriage to a red dot, his image was improved by the fact kamala &amp; waltz are even more absurd &amp; grotesque. Those two are just a memory now so once trump starts flooding the country with even more indians the election optics are going to fade.I doubt he’s going to be the next trump as so many predict, the indian fatigue is probably going to be off the charts by the time trump’s term ends. That &amp; as the GOP shills indians even harder, like how they had a hindu singer at the RNC- expect that to become a mainstay, they’re gonna need someone a little less ridiculous.I say that because it seems obvious but then again the GOP is completely retarded so its probably more realistic to expect to see the them put the indian flag right next to the star of david at GOP events going forward.

        Class assignment. Why are Trump and many of his appointees out there making endless outlandish statements? “Canada as the 51st state. Buy Greenland. End the Ukraine war in 24 hours. We can win a nuclear war. Attack Iran. Attack China. Defend Taiwan at all costs. Spend our way to prosperity. Defend the dollar with tariffs.” This is all obvious insanity. Is Trump trying to emulate Crazy Eddie? What is his purpose in presenting his new Administration as nut jobs on steroids? Are we supposed to swoon and chant like Revivalists before drinking the Kool Aid?

            Those are not monkeys, just like classic Greek man with wings is not a bird. Or another random god with a pet doesn’t mean the pets are “worshipped”.
Even a slightest bit of knowledge of any Aryan, Greek or Roman theology would make that clear. Heads, limbs and various body parts are always getting cut off in accidents, duels etc and replaced by a convenient nearest animal in all three theologies.

        Recently my money market account was hacked at my 5/3rd bank branch. Two large withdrawals in two days and yet nothing triggered any internal alarms. Just by happenstance I checked my balance to find out.This led to a few weeks with dealing with Indian call center and english problems. They are the worse and I cringe in despair anytime I have been directed by any corporation to this type of call center.my bank is one mile away, you know the place where I took my money, but no one can help at all except take deposits. How long do we have to tolerate this shit.on the other hand there is one nice and clean 7-11 near me with a polite and helpful owner. So there is that. In my business life I deal with many medical professionals and doctors, always a mixed bag.

            Switch to Huntington if they are in your region. They only use Indian call centers at peak periods when their American call centers can’t handle all the incoming calls. They are a more consumer friendly bank anyway. They pay better interest and they don’t gouge on fees. Huntington is a good bank as far as big banks go.

                It’s even better if you just call up the owner’s cell and say, “Jim, I’m gonna be writing a pretty big check later this afternoon” and everything is handled in the background. Better yet when Jim calls you to ask whether a given transfer is legit.

            Gleefully stabs Americans for 50 years, decimates the industrial economy into a hollow rust belt, then outsource all silicon chips and now enjoys the ultra cheap farm and construction related slave labor today.Then frantically types on a china made keyboard on a china made computer..to whine about “Indian/foreign call center” – to support a financialized not productive parasite banking based economy.Those accents are just so *icky* aren’t they ?But when it comes to personal responsibility – well, you sure love those cheap Japanese cars, and the Chinese iPhones – no way would you ever pay $5000 more for decent American wages for any of *those* items would you ? But that would have been the cost – close to $10K more per car and close to $500 more per iPhone, if you wanted to truly support America.Bullshit talks and money always walks to the foreign factory and call centers.

                    The trillion dollar question is why you do not have that choice. Hint: Unless by “elite” you mean “the people who call themselves government and their cronies”,it’s not the elites.
The business “elites” cannot take away any choice that is legitimately yours. They are simply responding to the incentive and disincentive structures put in place by both consumers and government “elites”.

                Shekeling consoomers to debt usury and the lie of a two party system worked for a while. This scam is over and the tsunami of sovereign debt default is nigh. This cycle has been repeated several times in previous empires, along with importing scum from the barbarian reaches towards the end. Unfortunately for the native White population there are no frontiers to escape to this time, and the only way out is through… the rivers of blood as prophesied by Enoch Powell. Fun times!

            I have never met anyone who says anything nice about Indians. I did not think much of it until a few years ago when on behalf of a client I had to work with the Indian IT company. The Americans feely said all sorts of horrible things about the Indians. These were people big into the BLM stuff, so it was quite a thing. After that, it is something I cannot stop noticing. The one thing that unites Americans is disdain for Indians.

                During the BLM cultural revolution stuff, I noticed something interesting. Even liberal whites, much less conservatives, didn’t like being lectured by Indians (or Asians but they rarely joined the fun). You’d see their faces start to twitch when some Patel started railing against white privilege.
Jews can get away with My fellow whites, Indians can’t.

But when they do, they go all-in, like George Takei or that Sarah Jeong creature. I don’t have any warmer feelings about East Asian invaders (can we please reclaim “oriental?” The idea that it was a slur is ridiculous — not that I care. It’s so much less clumsy than this directional Asians business).
My worst boss in my entire career was Chinese. He was just a terrible, evil person, and I am not being hyperbolic.

                One of my friends is a borderline autistic: unable to communicate in any other language than facts, reason and data, and utterly unflappable. He was tasked to negotiate a huge contract for his company that made cryptographic software for SIM-cards.The counterpart was an Indian telco rep, who wanted to change a clause that had previously been agreed on as a basis for negotiations. When my friend pointed out that this was already on the books, he started screaming. This went on for a while, until my friend stood up, left the room without a word and called the CEO to tell him, sorry, I can’t deal with this guy, he’s just screaming retard words at me.His boss laughed and told him not to sweat it, he’d send another guy. Apparently this was not his first experience with Subcontinentals.

                    Typical. No other group will abase themselves as much for stronger terms/more money. The autist’s replacement likely backed the Pajeet down but that won’t be a deterrent to future attempts to lie, cheat and steal.

                        There is a very famous, core part of Aryan theology about never lying and being ethical no matter what.In this story, the Aryan god always floated a little above the ground, since he never lied ever. And then, he finally got tricked into lying – just once – and his feet touched the ground at the very end of his life.For just one small unintentional lie in an otherwise 100% honest life.This story is known and revered by all Aryans.And btw. Pajeet isn’t an Aryan name – typical Aryan names are: swati, swastik, sweta, arjen, arjun, indra, rishi, vivek, virek, vikas, viki, minna, ila, ciran, kiran, angla, uschi, usha, hema etc.

                Have you read any Germanic or continental philosophical discourse, for say, oh the past 300 years or so ? Those writers literally had embolisms admiring Indian culture, religion and philosophy – the very epitome of civilization according to many of those folks.For a more recent twist, maybe start with Miguel Serrano, vril, pardesh, Theosophy or for maybe even Bill Pierce/NatAll with his Savitri Devi books.The average mutt doesn’t even know WHY the nazis adopted Indian symbols and spoke Hindi (the german word for swastika is ‘hakenkreuz’). Also, the average farker does not realize that the “dothead” is called ‘laltika’ — along with the swastika, an Aryan holy symbol.

                    The Germans didn’t admire Indian culture, although a few guys like Alfred Rosenberg, Rudolf Hess and Heinrich Himmler had romantic notions about the Vedas, but they weren’t exactly the leading lights of German philosophical tradtition.The swastika is a near-universal symbol that the National Socialists adopted from Germanic culture, and they did indeed call it the Hakenkreutz, the hooked cross; “swastika” is English usage.In 1938, the SS sent a team of mountaineers to Tibet to look for ancient Aryan something-something, and they got a lesson in Subcontinental culture when they had to resort to physical measures to keep horny Buddhist monks away from their pale behinds.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baJ7yvrjM_I

                        Swastika is a uniquely Sanskrit name and it is not English usage or an English word. So are all other shubhtikas, including laltikas and the syllable om.
The swastika is used universally in all religious and civil ceremonies in India. Most Indian temples, wedding, festivals, houses and celebrations are decorated with swastikas. The swastika has a sister symbol called the laltika(literally: ”red mark”) which is worn by Hindu priests during prayer and by women in India on their forehead as a sign of married status (also called bindi when used by women).

So nobody in here but us Pajeets have any idea what we’re talking about, then?
I’d love to explain it to them, but I don’t know the English word for swastika – maybe you could help me out?

                        “Aryan” was always an academic theory that at it’s core was rejecting a specific Germanic heritage. Germans are no more “Aryan” than fish are guinea pigs. That’s one of the many reasons I have zero uses for Hitler.
As this general discussion suggests, subcontinental Indians have opposite inclinations of Europeans.

                    Right-wing esotericists like Rene Guenon were fascinated by the vision of Indian culture that existed mostly in their minds. For that reason his works mostly depict western-gnosticist revival in the skin of Hinduism. They loved the idea of caste order with themselves at the top of course. I’m quite certain that if they were ever forced to interact with the entire civilization up-close, on a daily basis, they would have cured themselves quite quickly. It’s no feat to be a spoiled Western brat, tour eastern mysticists and write sentimental songs/treatises afterwards. At least back then nobody imported that biohazard into the homeland. Only degenerate, rootless aristocrats like von Coudenhove-Kalergi dreamed of a new empire for them, with the peons completely mixed-up so that a modern nationalist revolution could not happen.

                Back when I began workon my second (never completed) Master’s degree, I complimented an Indian woman in one of my classes on her sari.  By that time I had nothing but negative impressions of all the Pakis I saw and dealt with in England, but I still somehow considered Indians exotic.  I don’t know why I was so stupid when, back in high school when I worked in a fabric store, the Indians were universally loathed for coming in and leaving yards and yards of material spread around and then actually buying almost nothing.Then I went to Jamaica, and had to deal with Indian visa tourists from all over the world.  Their endless lies and arguing put even the Jamaicans to shame.  And then I dealt with them in Singapore.  And then I came home to what I remembered as America, and found Texas filled to the brim with Indians and Han.I have no illusions regarding anyone anymore.  I have zero affection for East Asians (also arrogant, rude, and stinky in their native environment and jarring in AINO), but I loathe subcons.

                    So similar, the Indians and the Pakis. Almost the same really.
Pakis: 9/11, KSM, Osama, chopping off infidels heads, UK grooming gangs, blowing up the London tube, genociding countless civilians in India, NYC Times square bomb, all of Europe a charnel house.
Indians: Hindu/Aryan, Buddhist, Jain, nirvana, no killing animals for meat, committed zero terrorist attacks, art, science, math, and the longest poem written in human history (mahabharata)
But you know what, I had so many illusions before, they are just the same really, so *icky*!

There’s a very old joke which everyone from Mandalay to Makassar knows which goes something like this:
Q: “You’re walking in the rice fields and you encounter an Indian and a cobra. You only have one bullet. What do you do?”A: “Shoot the Indian. Can always take your chances with the cobra.”

‘Regardless of what the people think, the oligarchs are going to plow ahead with their nation wrecking schemes.’
That’s for damn sure.  Everything else bores them, only raw power and total control suffices now.  It’s a bit too close to Christmas to say I hate globohomo, so I’ll pick it up tomorrow.

        This is hilarious really, even though it’s a serious issue. Has Trump’s style written all over it. Wait for it…
They probably just want all these tech people because they are more willing to illegally spy on, cancel, take away bank accounts, etc of Americans. And pay them a lot less to do it, too. A lot less.

        Most every professional dealing I have had with Indians has been negative.  Their smiling obsequiousness I find off-putting, covering for their single-minded scheme to use others to advance their own interest.  And, except for their skill at being oleaginous yes- men, they are incompetent.  And they look greasy and smell bad.I refuse to do business with any store owned by these creeps.  Those I am required to work with professionally, I give as little as I can to, knowing they are out to wheedle what they can from me.The condition of India speaks to the worthiness of Indians, like Haiti does to Haitians, Somalia to Somalians and Denmark to Danes.

        This outcome was obvious a short time back when Vivek made that tweet with he and his son at Rome’s Colosseum where he tweeted something to the effect that they were looking at, “our history.” The next clue was a podcast about 6-8 months ago with Balaji Srinivasan. During the podcast Srinivasan said two things that tell you everything.He claimed the 20th century was about the center defeating the right. He ignored the Left whose defeat he must presume is just a given. He declared that the 21st century’s political war was about the center defeating nationalism. So, Trump’s oligarchy is about defeating nationalism. So much for MAGA.While he declared war on nationalism, he made an explicit ethno-supremacist claim. He said that historically, Asia was superior to The West. He claimed that the last 500 years were an anomaly and claimed that Asia is returning to its superior position.So, defeat nationalism but Asian nations will arise and dominate. Yeah. His network state thing is just a ploy to further atomize Whites.I can’t find the link. It was on The Maze podcast. Pete Quinones recommended it and somehow while celebrating the tech oligarchy rising up missed these critical points.The other key piece of the puzzle is Stephen Steinlight’s 2001 paper: “https://cis.org/Report/Jewish-Stake-Americas-Changing-Demography” In it, he admits the Jews are turning whites into a minority and he clearly states his aim is Jewish power and American vassalage to Israel. However, he documents his worry that the change is too rapid. Ultimately, while never mentioning whites as a political force, he states the Jews should pursue a strategy of allying with Asians in order to, “divide and conquer.”So now you have David Sacks surrounded by an endless gaggle of South Asians and appointing their guy to unleash the flood of H1B AI workers that Trump announced a couple of months ago. Andreeson and Musk are just brazen traitors. More European dolts pursuing their individual fortunes with no sense of folkhood and a greater identity. They won on their own, so they will be fine.I don’t meme. Whoever on our side does has all the information here that they need to get on Twitter and meme the hell out of this and connect the dots. This isThe Tech Oligarchy is far more formidableThat all said, Vivek’s tweet is not off base. Of course, when a people have been conquered as Americans were in 1933 and then formally at the end of a bayonet in the 1950s, they won’t be very motivated. Modernity and its toys and the crime of the welfare state help the bleeding.That said, Vivek is correct. Get your child off of TV and off of phones and watches. That stuff is all anti-White poison. Get your kids to all-White participatory sports. Emphasis outdoorsman sporting activities. Wild them. Get them to music lessons and get them playing European High Art music as a discipline. Get them playing spatial reasoning games and doing puzzles and building drones and robots. Get them reading our true bibles: The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Aeneid and other great works like The Divine Comedy, Shakespeare, Western Fairytales, American cowboy fiction. Get the boys reading GA Henty and then give them an outlet in physical space to network with other young White children and play out those fantasies.We did forfeit our inheritance. Asians value it and are hungry and here to take it. They are doing all of those things. They already have a conquerors new history ready to tell their and our children. They built Rome, they dominated the world and now they are taking their rightful place.Notice that there is no talk of ending affirmative action and of ending the Civil Rights Regime. Not a peep. Carnegie Mellon STEM is run by Asians. They embrace DIE. Why? Well, you can crowd out the few whites who are credentialed enough to get in. Have a look at their website.We better wake our asses up. We better be resolved to get in physical and mental shape so that we can engage in this fight and win. We better resolve to do so and be bent on domination. Otherwise, an elite Camp of The Saints and Steinleight’s Jew:Asian alliance to divide and conquer, already in an advanced phase, will complete our dispossession.

            Weraised our sons much as you suggest – lots of outdoor playtime and nature museum/walk time and building time and reading time.  But then, we agreed before having children that we would never send them to daycare – and we took the financial hit for that – and for private Christian school tuition – for many years.  We were the last to get a home computer and flat screen tv, and we didn’t jaunt off on European vacations (or vacations at all).  Most today won’t ‘deny themselves’ in that way – neither husbands nor wives.  “But we both HAVE to work.”  No, you don’t.  Prioritize your kids, or don’t bother having them.

            I refute Vivek’s weird nerd screed thus:Go to a mall. Who’s there? Not white kids.Indian wiggers.(Presumably there’s a real term for that, but you know what I mean.)He doesn’t know.He’sonly seen TV—TV so old that it had white kids on it hanging out with other white kids. He knows nothing of the world outside media, especially not of the world white people inhabit, which, as those who still habitually consume the posoined media lament, isnot televised.We are diseased, but his diagnosis is totally fake.Indian doctor.The white people internet is aboutgardening.

            Impossible. You should research recent efforts by professional soccer clubs to set up academies in India. The thinking was that there was undiscovered talent that they could find, much like they were able to find in other parts of the third world (Africa, Latin America, etc.) Nope. Not only were they unable to discover any future stars, they were unable to discover anybody capable of even playing at a high level. One by one the academies closed. One and half billion people, and not one pro athlete!

        Vivek always gets the side-eye from me.  He would say things and articulate MAGA quite well, but when he talks about Making America Great Again he’s not talking about America as the American People, but America as a corporate P&amp;L.  This brain-dead set of comments is everything people hate about Globalism distilled down.It’s also humorous because the same guy saying we’re a bunch of stupid, lazy, illiterate, irredeemable people who can’t do math is the guy saying we should shutter the Dept. of Education. It is completely lost on him that he’s undermining his core message which is that the government is too big and fails too much.  Getting rid of the Ed. Dept. would HELP Americans educate our kids.  Not just the STEM crap, but electricians, welders, and the rest of the people who build and fix things.Does he come out and say we should kill the Ed. Dept. and rebuild our education system to produce the expertise our country needs to thrive?  One that values STEM but recognizes STEM can’t do shit without electrians and welders and tradesmen of all sorts?  Nope.“Fu*k it.  Replace them all.” – Vivek/Elon

                College (classic liberal arts and professional majors like pre-med, engineering, etc.)ought to be for the top 15% of the native population only.  It was never meant to be a trade school, prepare you for a job, or provide remedial instruction to the left half of the bell curve.  It is a classic boomer mindset that everyone must go to college.

                    I remember when they went after companies’ interviewing and hiring practices that required candidates to demonstrate competence, claiming it was discriminatory.  Companies shifted to requiring college degrees as a proxy for competence.  So then they pushed the colleges to lower admission standards and requirements for graduation, so everyone (and especially the preferred victim classes) could get the now devalued “credentials”.

        Americans of a certain age will remember when dark brown people (or “sand joggers”, to use the parlance of the times) began appearing behind the counter of non-chain convenience stores.
These stores all had three things in common: the smell, the restrooms being indefinitely out-of-order, and the fact that fourteen year-olds could by beer there.
As one of those fourteen year-olds, we got round the restroom problem when possible by pissing on the side of the building.  To the extent that this constituted resistance to these interlopers, it is the only resistance I am aware of.

        It’s depressing to know that even on Christmas day, even the “right” can’t take a day off from the social media struggle session. Says a lot about the state of our “culture.”
When I look at the business models that Vivek, Musk, and Thiel have followed, it doesn’t exactly give me the warm fuzzies. And that’s before I get into their personal characteristics. With “friends” like these….  Comically, I’ve seen, I think it was in Slate, it being theorized that Vance would influence the Trump admin toward a harder line against these H1B visas. It is to laugh.

        “It is perhaps not a coincidence that the origin of the people called gypsies is most likely the Indian subcontinent.”

            I have seen gypsies in AINO all over Texas, and even a few here in our new state of residence.  The cops used to come and make them move on as vagrants; now they can’t be bothered.  I just call them “tsigani” (the term I learned for them in Bulgaria) and they practically spit their hatred at me.  Most ‘merkans cannot distinguish them from other subcons, yet they cannot square seeing them begging on street corners when thinking of their supposed ‘educated’ subcon neighbors.  I know better that they come from the same failed gene pool.

                Yes, I am very familiar with that term “tsigani”, but the village term used by my people is “gjupsie” (plural) and “gjuptin” (singular and masculine)/”gjuptinka” (feminine)–skills getting rusty as I age. Have you ever heard those before?

        Notice that the deboosting scheme Musk referred to was a “reminder”. Compound suppression of accounts based on reporting and blocking, particularly by blue checks, far more than from boost/deboosting based on likes has been part of the algorithm since long before Musk.I and many other smaller RW accounts I know experienced no change when Musk took over. We have been suppressed to about 1 to 10% of the views you’d expect based on our account size since mid to late Covid panic. Mostly likely many of us were permanently damaged by left wingers brigade blocking and reporting of accounts that embarrassed them in arguments, coordinated in group chats. I noticed my reach got much worse when I migrated from posting about Covid to RW politics.The thing about the demerit system is that if an account is big enough, it seems to override the piecemeal deboosting. This is why twitter had a team of human censors manually suppressing and banning larger offensive accounts pre-Musk. When he took over, he fired them, liberating the big accounts, but the suppression of smaller accounts has remained unchanged.

            My stuff never shows up in anyone’s feed, I am told. I never see Charles Haywood unless I got directly to his profile. Some of it is the same old shenanigans and some of it is the Indian spaghetti code. Follower counts are also bullshit. I see people with 100K followers and their tweets get a handful of replies. The old regime boosted the follower accounts of favored people and limited those of the disfavored. No one has bothered to clean it up, because the last think Musk wants is honest numbers about the site.

                I do see you and Haywood in my feed, but I curate who I follow pretty scrupulously. I agree that most of it is built-in stuff that Musk had never bothered to work on. It may actually be so baked-in that it would be a monumental task. He reinstated banned high profile accounts and then declared himself the lord of free speech. However, his new post indicates that he knows it has been happening all along.

        I really don’t know why Elon doesn’t get the hate he so well deserves from this side of the great divide.  Musk belongs in prison.  I think he and Tesla are under investigation right now. No doubt Trump will stop the investigation.Our roads should not be a test bed for his stupid “full self driving” software that doesn’t work and is marketed as “Full Self Driving” as if you can fall asleep behind the wheel.Not only has he unleashed this evil on our roads, the Tesla autopilot will shut it self off milliseconds before a crash.  Then Tesla says “Autopilot was not engaged during this incident”  This is up there with diesel gate.  A lot of Tesla employees and management and especially Musk (he is Tesla) should be in prison for this.

Someone should, anyway. I’m more of acaveat emptorguy. Some assclown plows into me with “his” Tesla, I’m suing him for as much as humanly possible. Anyone who is such a poor driver that he thinks the autopilot is better than he is should not be on the roads, let alone have the cash to buy a Tesla.

                Hmmm…inferior navigation systems and expensive toys. That recalls a Z Man 12/24 post behind his green door which I’ll quote:
A thing you see in certain areas is the insane “youthful” driver in a car that costs more than he has earned in his life though legitimate means. They are not just oblivious to the law and general decency but seem to be unaware of physical reality. I watched an expensive Mercedes drive into the back of a truck as the driver tried to dart in behind it.

            Andreesen was on a recent interview talking optimism and tech. I think it was the meathead British gatekeeper Chris Williamson show. In any case, the background is that autonomous vehicles are difficult to master because with other humans on the road, they cannot compute the anomalies that humans can. So, these machines work great when there are no humans on the road. Moreover, in drone swarms the drones talk to each other and can fly in formations that are highly coordinated. The same technology applies to cars on a grid.The obvious thing is, at some point, to outlaw human drivers. Andreesen effectively said that is coming. He acknowledged these facts and then used the, “safety”, case to argue that too many people die and are injured in car accidents. Remove human drivers, replace them with machines and you get rid of the deaths.In any case, the point here is that all of these tech oligarchs have hidden their hand. Not well, but well enough to hide it from a hyper-feminized dork dominated fem-culture. They didn’t let the crisis go to waste. They came in as the solution but they have the same aims as their buddies in Davos. Heck. They are Davos.They won’t get rid of subsidies and regulations. They will write the regulations and give themselves the subsidies. That will fund robot bartenders, outlawed human drivers and robotic cars, drone deliveries. … …We don’t know who attempted the assassination of Trump. We don’t know who ultimately did the lawfare against him. They brought him to heel and removed any of his independence. Assume it was the people well organized enough to come in and assume the mantle of MAGA.Per my earlier post, their goal isn’t America, it is territoryless, (for you but not for them), digital “states”, and the supremacy of Asia and the final and total conquest of The West.Musk and Andreesen are fully aligned with FDR’s vision to eradicate The West and erect a global world. They won’t be subsumed but their children and grandchildren will be along with those of yours who aren’t prepared or willing to fight for centuries to restore a new West.

                I have serious doubts about the alleged safety of these systems, especially in the short to medium term.  They make ridiculous mistakes no human would ever make.  Some Tesla just slammed on its brakes for no reason in a tunnel or on a bridge and caused like a 7 car pileup.This is a future problem. Elon has these cars out there self-driving without having been tested and certified for level 5 driving.  They are beta testing their shitty software on our roads where we and our children are travelling, roads we, not Tesla, pays for.  Worse, Tesla owners aren’t paying either as most of the taxes for roads are embedded in gasoline and diesel fuel.Then there is the dishonest aspect of Tesla Autopilot turning itself off milliseconds before the crash so Tesla can lie and say Autopilot was not enabled at the time of the crash.  Are insurance companies paying out when a Tesla cripples someone?  I would think they would deny the coverage if autopilot is enabled and not in the insurance contract.  In my state, you have to sue yourself if you get hurt (no fault insurance), so these Teslas are likely driving up our already outrageous insurance rates.Driving is an absolute joy outside of rush hour.  Everyone remembers their first time driving or their first road trip.  The freedom that comes with a car.  Only the bugmen want to see a future where we work in our car while the car drives us around.  It’s more of a dystopia than a utopia to me.

            Trump campaigned on massive expansion of H1-B pajeetapalooza because his Silicon Valley cartel bosses want it. The bait and switch for the gullible MAGAshabbos was the false promise of mass deportations of illegals which is completely impossible given the issues with due process.

                Yes but at the same time in 2016 he totally denounced the H-1B program for essentially the reasons we are, and his entire base is against this stuff. Even the left don’t like Indian immigrants because unlike low-skill illegals they actually compete with them and it seems Indian H-1B workers aren’t deeply tied into to their patronage network. I think he’s sensitive to great swaths of the public being against something. It really depends how much leverage these SV CEO types have with him and how important this particular issue actually is for them.

        Riddle me this, please. Why are China and India letting their best and brightest escape to the U.S.? Don’t they feel that they need them at home? Sure, there are likely numerous ‘plants’ among those that wash up on shore here who remain committed to their home countries. I probably work with more than a few at Warlabs, Inc. But I don’t hear any alarms being raised about a native brain-drain in Beijing and Bangalore. I’d like to think that TPTB here in the formerly great U.S. would be concerned if significant numbers of our pale, stale, male STEM bros jumped ship with no intention of returning.

            There is some evidence that the Chinese are no longer letting their best exit to the US because they are aware of the decline in the quality of higher ed in the US.
As for plants, there are tens, possibly hundreds of thousands spread across all Western institutions.Beijing gets near real-time updates on our leading-edge research due to the nearly complete lack of serious security protocols in Western universities.

        All in all this Indian flub has been a godsend- proof that someone up there might have both the sense of humor and pity.Instead of being told sweet little lies, the rubes got angered by stupidly candid rambling from “their” oligarch. Granted, like with all slights and insults, nothing major will happen, but the pain will be remembered in the right moment.The worse part of me desires to see a follow-up series of “Why scab labor was actually good”, just to see the salt blasted into an already flesh wound.As for the sub-continentals, they’re starting to work in low-level politics even in my country (although we already had a Nigerian MP, so the trail has been blazed, now just needs to be soiled).

        Whites don’t have the willpower to kick these grifters out of the US. The first video of a crying child and mass deportations will stop. Of course, democratic judges with the support of the Republicans will make sure it doesn’t get to that point.

        I could say a lot concerning this subject, but I’ll limit myself to a recent outrage.  The wife a few months back ran slightly afoul of a tech scam – India’s biggest industry apparently – and found herself on the phone with “John” or “Dave” or something.  She realized what was going on pretty quick though and hung up on the guy.What outrages me to this day however is that he was telling her that her “problems” were probably due to her husband, i.e. me, using her computer to watch pR0n.  Even though I’m no St. Francis of Assisi, I am 100% innocent. Yet here’s some greasy, urine-scented creep on the phone trying to tell her I’m some kind of degenerate – probably touchinghimselfall the while.  I really don’t know what these scammers are thinking.  Do they just get off on trying to create rifts?  Istheirlife’s dream to toss off to dirty movies all the time so they assume everyone in American is doing the same?  All I know is that I’d love to take an ax handle to the little rat’s colon should I ever cross paths with him.

            Write down their phone number(s).  Think of every diversity outrage you’ve endured, call them back and let rip.  Especially insult them for being dark (skin whitening is a huge industry there) and inadequate in the sexual arena.  What are they going to do – complain to the FBI that you’ve insulted them when they were trying to scam you?  They will break character, curse incoherently, and hang up.  Call them back again.  Do this enough and I guarantee they will stop calling your number.

        Re: Call Centers
Citizens Bank uses call centers where almost everybody you encounter seems to have a Latin American accent. I was told a lot of those call centers are based in Miami, but I’m thinking it could also be Puerto Rico or anywhere else in Latin America.
Anyway, I don’t have a problem communicating with the Latin American call centers at all. I find them much easier to understand and communicate with than the ones in Asia. Maybe it’s the cadence in their speech.

            My consumer complaints are about fairly serious electronics. The stuff from Asia doesn’t have problems (not made in China), so I mostly call EU companies. They see the call is coming from America and send it to some kind of Mexican, and sometimes that’s fine, but usually he’s working to metrics, doesn’t understand me or pretends not to, tries to elicit anger so he can claim I’m harassing him, and demands thatI saythat our interaction can be considered “closed,” with no actual communication having taken place, because that’s what the resolution the company most desires.I’ve learned not to buy anything from white-country corporations.

Grandfather was a red-headed Italo-Celtic and grandmother was a northern Italian with, I’m told, French ancestry.I’m the first to admit that Italian immigration brought a lot of negatives to the country — anarchist violence and the mafia prominent.

                    There are very pale Presbyterians in my heritage and I don’t trust Presbyterians, terribly cucked denomination, so you should beware. There are also some grubby Italian vintners, and they’re always up to no good.Stereotypes exist for a reason. What my comment meant is that there’s no shame in judging people by what’s obvious about them. Sometimes you’ll be wrong, but probably less often than if you cripple your judgment by forcing yourself to try to divine “the content of their character” without paying attention to any external cues. It’s a stupid strategy, because in most transactions with strangers, by the time you’ve divined “the content of their character,” you’ve already been fleeced.For example, I raise livestock — cattle and Boer (meat) goats. The cattle are pretty easy to market, because Americans love beef, but goats are a little more niche. When I sell them directly, instead of bulk at auction, I get calls from a lot of Pakistanis and Nepalese. After a couple years of unpleasant dealings, I don’t have to establish a personal relationship with each Paki to know I’m probably not going to like it. I don’t even answer the calls or emails from the Pakis and Nepalese anymore. I’d rather just send them to auction if I can’t find a local American buyer (typically kids doing 4-H projects).I also had a Paki who was my regional supervisor at my last tech job. Perfectly nice guy. Reasonably competent and nice to deal with. But I didn’t have much of a choice if I wanted to keep working there. They didn’t ask my opinion when they gave him the job, so I got to discover “the content of his character” whether I liked it or not. But I still would have rather they gave the job to an American, because I like my own people. There’s no shame in that.

        I sent a link to this piece to a Facebook friend (half East Asian, by the way). He’s also skeptical about Indians. Here’s a story from his days working at a corporate headquarters in the Chicagoland area.“Iremember the hatred of them at _____ HQ.. They were being flown in non-stop during my time there. They had their orientations during the evening/night time hours when most of the white/American employees were not working. You knew it was 530-6pm at HQ because you would start to hear the Indian music being blasted on the different floors. All the Hispanic cleaning/housekeeping people kept boomboxes on their cleaning carts with their Mexican music blasted trying to drown out the Indian music at nights.”

            A oriental chinaman is “skeptical” about Aryans. A pygmy I know (bantu maybe) is skeptical about the Greek Pantheon as well – have you *seen* the non stop crowds in Athens?, he asks me.
The Bantu are clearly more human than the subhuman Greeks, he says with the utmost confidence, confidence mixed with revulsion. He isn’t compensating for anything of course, not at all..

        “It is not all good news. In response to getting blasted on his own platform, Musk has rolled out a new censorship scheme so he and his tech bros will not get the sads reading their feed.”
Yeah, look what it did to Brittany Spears. Does this mean we see Musk in black eye-liner and a thong bikini dancing around for us? Admit it, that does not seem far-fetched in current year, from occurring at some point.

        Yep, further illuminating ruth b*mb here:Indians act as either abused or abuser, there is nothing in between in their world view:https://www.unz.com/article/india-its-worse-than-you-think/Note also that ‘good’ EU immigrants were replaced by multiples with Third World ones in the UK after Brexit. And that this was actually demanded and planned for by respective senior heads of these communities and endorsed by the leading Brexiteers.At least, the public there has woken up to the scam, to its enormous net cost instead of the for a long time alleged and unquestioned net benefit, and that is starting to be debated there:https://conservativepost.co.uk/story-of-the-century-flawed-migration-policies-to-cost-the-uk-government-a-trillion-pounds-a-year/

        The illustrations in that P.J.O’Rourke piece were really splendid. They remind me of the great illustrations that appeared in Mad Magazine during its salad days. In fact, if I had to guess, I would say the illustrator was Mort Drucker.

        this is related to the topic because I feel this gets to the idea about at what point does meritocracy become striverocracy? In theory I like the idea of meritocracy, but I feel it inevitably gets to the point of a striverocracy, which I feel tends to parallel the rise of indians in our elite class

                Rule by striver.
Strivers are the ambitious, grinder, do-anything types who may not have all that much actual merit, but who are willing to do anything to succeed.
See Reese Witherspoon’s character, Tracy Flick, in the filmElection.

            When merit means metrics, and the numbers/milestones/credentials are “gameable” rather than neutral observations (the mostg-purist IQ tests being an example of the latter), striving—which not only includes but favors cheating and nepotism—will win.No one considers amore accurately numberedmeritocracy ideal, either. The schools who rejected me (perfect SAT back when that was very rare, unique “extracurricular” resume, notable parents) understood that. I wasn’t afit. See: this comment. See also: Ivy League admissions’ claims that Asians (the good ones) are boring.Only the farm-to-NASA pipeline has really proven itself, civilizationally. Find your best where they are—in the “interior,” probably—and send them up. The existing system—shit Republicans say about the world of talent outside America (whollyoutside it), DEI/equity as historical remedy, etc.—is specifically a travesty ofthat. National greatness is everywhere but where the greatest nation actually found it.Anyway—The system generates exactly the hierarchy it’s meant to generate.Grotesque injustice issmug.Nerds are dumb.

        Having worked as a software developer at 2 big corporations, what they do is create “{Company}U” programs to source junior devs with no work experience. All of the recruits come from the Computer Science Master’s Degrees programs, which are almost completely filled up with Indians or Chinese people.Recruiters are typically 20- or 30-something women with little-to-no actual serious knowledge of technology, so they assume that the masters degree graduates have higher acumen than the typical American with a BS or BA in Computer Science. The truth is that you don’t actually even need a degree to be a competent programmer.At the school where I got my BA in Comp Sci, the grad program actually compressed the 2 freshman fundamental programming classes into one semester because most of the Indian grad students were shitty programmers, and they needed remediation cause their universities are basically shite.

        Having been in tech all my life, I didn’t mind Indians so much, though I have gotten annoyed at the clannishness that Z’s pointed out. As with so many groups (including blacks, IMHO), they’re OK one on one, but if you have for example, 4 Tamils in your group, they close ranks and speak Tamil all the time and try to exclude whitey. Still, I never developed the animosity my wife did while she worked as a retail manager. She had to deal with working-class call-center types that would smell terrible, bring in the whole annoying family, and/or try to pull off scams. My favorite was the ones who’d photocopy coupons or claim “somebody hacked my Groupon account.” In my view, it’s due to the difference between high-caste and low-caste, college educated and not. Still, even though there are Indian folks I count as friends, I say we have plenty of them and shouldn’t let in any more for the foreseeable future.

            The high-caste are worse for the US than the low-caste, because being invaded by a foreign overclass is more harmful to a nation than a foreign underclass.
10% of the country being obsolete farm equipment was always a problem, but they by themselves didn’t stop the US from being a White settler nation. It was the foreign overclass that did that. A Congress infested with the children of turn-of-the-century immigrants did that.
