        Just saw that a London Uber driver kicked 2 male passengers out of his cab for getting too frisky in his car. The poofs kicked up their usual attention seeking fuss and the media have gone after it. No pictures of the driver to be thrown onto the witch burning pyre of PC though.

        A NYC taxi medallion is now ~$1M. Just to operate. Add labor, car, &amp; other expenses, and it is no small deal, the cost of which must be borne by the riders. In NYC itself taxi drivers have committed rapes, plural. In YBor City FL the taxi-sewers (AKA Cartel Lawyers) stopped a guy driving people around the party section in golf carts for tips &amp; ads on the carts. Regs are rarely for people and sold as necessary whether it be Taxi Cartels, Hospital Cartels (AKA Hospital Boards), or toy testing. Also in FL the dental labs wanted licensing (their own Cartel) but the Dentists, their customers, got rid of that knowing regs &amp; licensing are not for customers.

        Z, sounds like you’re siding with the left on this issue, especially regarding the single rape case (which may not even be real as rapegate has shown).It may be easier just to put Uber out of business.Who would do that? The big govt.? That sounds antithetical to the American ideal of free market capitalism. If the divers felt like they were getting a raw deal they would quit, and eventually Uber would go out of business without having to be forcibly shut down. No one is putting a gun to the Uber drivers and forcing them to do thisA google search for taxi scams should provide all the evidence you need that these taxi drivers don’t play by the rules either, despite being held as the victims. Part of the reason why conventional taxis are so horrible is became of the regulation, which compels drivers to find shady ways to milk their passengers for more money.Uber is a much needed disruption

            1) I have no love for taxi oligopolies. I don’t put it very high on my list of concerns, but I’m not a libertarian. If I were mayor of NYC, I’d probably be in favor of deregulating it, but that is no free lunch. There’s a reason they limit the number of taxis.2) I’m not a fan of Uber mostly because the people who are fans annoy me. That’s a terrible reason, but there it is. I think Uber mostly exists because it violates the laws and regulations in the places it does business. It avoids a whole lot of costs by skirting the rules. That’s not disruptive technology. That’s robbery.3) If a city like New York suddenly deregulated cabs and let anyone setup shop, the result would be a disaster. You would have more cabs and cheaper rates, but more problems too. In short order the people would demand re-regulation of the cabs. That’s the thing with libertarianism. It only works if the people have no say and the rulers are a breed of human that has yet to exist.

        One rape? That’s it?Old school taxi companies are happy with regulation for the same reason large established companies are. It keeps newcomers away. It profit’s no one? It profits cab companies and government. Drivers choose between ten hour and twelve hour shifts. They make bupkiss.Uber has no monopoly. This will be evolved by ambition against ambition, in defect of “better” motives. Competition is the only effective regulation. Give jimmy madison a chance, for Jesus sake. That’s old school.I’m still amazed that one Federal judge had the understanding and guts to break up AT&amp;T, and they were a good deal better at providing service than the cab companies partnered with government whores.
