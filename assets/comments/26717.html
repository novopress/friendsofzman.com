        This is an excellent article. In fact, its thesis would be good political science dissertation fodder if you could find a poli sci department that wouldn’t expell you and report you to the FBI for even broaching this topic.
One suggestion, however: lose post-Marx culturalist–such a mouthful–and replace with poststructuralist.

        This is a “Throw Mama From the Train” primary season.Republicans want Trump out, but can’t be seen to do it.Democrats want Biden out, but can’t be seen to do it.
Sounds like a ripe opportunity for bi-partisan deal-making!
Too bad us Dirt People don’t have any sort of organization to take advantage of the resulting chaos at the local and state level.

        The next phase of conservatism will primarily be grifting.  Grifting is bad now, but will get worse in 2024.  There really isn’t much left in mainstream conservatism other than fleecing as many people as possible.

        Jackson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Roosevelt. Those are your American archetypes: a warrior populist, and a nerd backed by business/financial interests. I’m not sure the pattern holds, but if it does, that’s good news. It looks like a big war could be on the horizon, then again MIC is now one of those interests spoiling to be cut down to size.

        I can’t work up an interest in the inner workings of the GOP. They are not going to win in ten months. Guys, 2020 actually happened. It was total fraud. They’re not going to let someone who might start digging, win. Their freedom, and possibly their lives, depend on that. They would start hot war with Russia and China before letting that happen.When Trump was (not actually really; can you say “trial balloon”?) removed from the CO primary, his life insurance premium should have dropped. If he gets near the white house again, the only flying steamroller will, oh just so very very unfortunately, happen to crash on his head. Or the last California condor will give him super bird flu or something. “Something very very unforeseen just happened to the president elect”These are the people we’re dealing with. This discussion today seems to have an air of normalcy bias. We have no future in this system. The most useful thing is to wake normie John up to the fact that it’s a regime, not a republic. And that his future is more endangered than the condor

        The conventional wisdom is that bill Clinton moved the party to the center and away from the liberalism of Walter Mondale.
But I think this mistakes what people really think of when they think of liberal. They mean the sort of technocratic Ted talk kind of liberalism. And in some ways it was bill Clinton who moved the party in that direction.
So would you guys agree that liberalism is a personality more than it is an ideology?

            Mythmaking. The GOP congress of that era pulled Clinton to the center, so he said “Hey, look at me, I’m a mainstream centrist.”

            The issue in America is race.  Clinton continued the war on whites, as did Bush II.  That’s all that matters. They were and are the enemy.  His wife can’t stop vomiting hate on the white population.  Moving to the center on anything else is trivial, and if he did move anything to the center it was because he couldn’t sell the left’s beliefs, particularly their seething white-hating racism to the demographics of 90s America.  Thanks to immigration they no longer need to fear the “Silent Majority.”

        I still believe Col. Douglas MacGregor once had it in him to rescue America but now he’s more concerned about milk and cookies. That guy was our last opportunity to avoid a terrible end to the empire and he crapped his pants.

        I have heard many of the Roman Empire/GAE comparisons for several years now. A subset of that is wondering if an “American Caesar” will ever arise. The subject is pretty broad and I am not one who believes that history repeats itself (although it DOES rhyme) so there is no need to go into the specifics. However there is Roman history factoid that is never considered and that is that there were many proto-Caesars before the real Caesar showed up. The first ones (The Grachii) and the last one (Caesar himself) are well known but there is almost 100 years between those two bookends. Every 10 years or so after Tiberius a new one would rise up (starting with Tiberious’ brother Gaius). Each one would get a little farther but make a mistake or miscalculation and lose against the entrenched elites and (ultimately) lose their life until Gaius Jullius arrived and “won”.Trump may not be Caesar but maybe he is Saterninus or Catallus.

            Rome had propraetors and proconsuls who’s commanded armies were more loyal to them than to the government. There is no modern equivalent.
We will never get a caesar. Maybe a Yeltsin, but not a caesar.

                Good point. What many people miss about Caesar is that he’d been planning and acting to accomplish that goal, not just posting on whatever passed for an internet.  It didn’t just happen.  No one has been doing the equivalent of becoming Governor of Gaul, or gaining wealth and glory to sway the people of Rome to your cause.  He made common cause with a military guy and financial guy in the 1st Triumvirate of Rome, which is no longer possible.Every governor is a cuck, the military has been purged of the disloyal, and every aspect of our financial system is controlled by our Enemy.  Our Enemy knows where the levers of power lie, and they control all of them.There isn’t going to be a Caesar, unless we make and support one.

            I think Trump is peculiar to present-day America.There will be no American Caesar because the last two possible candidates – Douglas MacArthur and George Patton – are long dead and the system has seen to it ever since that no similar men will arise.

        The Clintons pulled off the great political coup of re-orienting corporate America and the rich away from the GOP to the Democratic Party. Outsourcing production and importing cheap labor has been a boon for corporations and their shareholders. All the woke stuff is just psychological warfare to prevent any reversal of the gravy train. The GOP still loves corporate money, which is why they have been unwilling to oppose the outsourcing of the economy and the browning of America, even though it is political suicide for them.

            Yep. What’s kept a cap on wages? Immigration. It’s openly acknowledged and discussed (among the various economists that I read). That’s why the old-school left was anti Immigration. It hurt the wages of the workin’ man. And by damn, they were right.
The New Americans are likely also the biggest patrons of Wal Mart. That cheap shit and those wide-screen TVs top anything you can get in their nations of origin. Consoom, baby, consoom! And cue up the griller points on how capitalism has lifted billions from poverty and made them consooomers of American entertainment output.

                Meh. It’s still trivial to set a Morton building on a slab outside of town and set up Fred’s Discount Warehouse or Johnson’s Tire Barn. Still lots of places you don’t even need a business license to do so.
Yes, it’s more difficult to set up your own petrochemical business, but you could at least go into business making and bottling industrial products kinda like Simple Green, hire a bunch of that cheap labor everyone thinks exists, and take treasure bath after treasure bath, all day long.

                    I see it around here. They build the strip malls, the corporate chains move in, then they build housing and move in the livestock. Lots of white suburbanites. Black and brown soon follow. Just another farming operation, when you get down to it.

            “The GOP still loves corporate money, which is why they have been unwilling to oppose the outsourcing of the economy and the browning of America, even though it is political suicide for them.”Is it really though?  Think about Normie and the fact that he still roams around with his favorite brown guy NFL jersey on and still believes things like “when WE take over the Senate, or when WE take over the house”.  I think the GOP continues to be made up of clueless retards is because they can, and there are plenty of white normies who still eat it up.  Raise their taxes, take away their SS and maybe they will complain, but hate them for being white and they will say and do nothing out of fear of being called “racist”.Also, I fail to see how anything gets solved politically.  I fear that the only way change occurs is what we dare not speak of – which entails the removal of the virus.

                Tired Citizen:  I just scanned Gayway Pundit and dozens of comments by normiecons swooning over ramaswarthy.  They want him to be Secretary of State or VP, but all agree he merits an important post in the Trump administration.  No concerns about his past financial dealings, his pharmaceutical shenanigans, his WEF ties, and least of all his subcon ancestry.He fulfills all their rose-colored dreams of a perfect magic paper ‘murrican, true red white and blue because he believes in muh freedum and democracy.  It’s only evil notsees who consider putting a hindoo in the oval office to be less than wise.Even if I agreed with those here who think grillers are starting to notice the anti-White hate (I don’t), I still wouldn’t be bothered with the futile task of awakening them to the reality of the genetics&gt;culture&gt;politics&gt;economics hierarchy.  Let them have their heroswamy as they continue to put their ‘principles’ ahead of their progeny.

You see what I see.  I don’t see anyone waking up.  The NFL stadiums are more packed now than ever.  For me I don’t ever expect it to be fixed or improve.  The good guys don’t always win and this war is over.  For me, until an armed conflict comes about, I care nothing about it, and I won’t pay attention to it.  Nothing else is going to fix it.
The only way to beat evil is to permanently remove it.  Take that as you will.

                    People on the Right are often desperate for a Cope.  For those like us, the #1 Cope is that if we just post the right argument online the Normie will wake up and do all the work for us.
Normies by their nature cannot wake up.  We need to stop caring about them.  They aren’t coming to save us.  No one is.

                    Yeah… it is so pathetic. Like the swooning when the Bain guy who won the Virginia governorship (Youngkin?) had as his Lt-Gov that black lady who was a former Marine. A weird pleasure of mine – gotta be a German word for it — is reading Instapundit and the griller con comments. Glenn Reynolds is one of the stupidest people in the world, and it’s all downhill from there. Anyway, with regard to Lady Marine: “I like the cut of her job!” “Look at all the blacks voting for Trump!” “Real Jews support Likud and the Gaza bombing!”Is “american intellectual culture” the worst, as in the stupidest and most deluded, in the history of the world? I’m increasingly coming to that conclusion, with the likes of Reynolds on the “right” and the NYT on the “left.”

        What has really, really bothered me is the absolute nihilistic bloodthirstiness of much of the ostensible “conservative”/museum type base, eg Instapundit and PowerLine, who of course amplify and repeat the expected talking points. And cheered on in the comments. The Scofield heresy has done its work well, aided and abetted by the corruption and “americanization” of Protestantism. It’s sad from both a cultural and spiritual standpoint. They don’t care about the desecration of Confederate monuments because they wuz Democrats but by God, dare ye not touch a hair of the head of our favorite ally.The end of the united states, which has proven itself the greatest enemy of civilization and the European tradition (Greco-Christian, not the other more popular formulation) cannot come soon enough.

Both Instapundit and Powerline are NeoCon websites. You’re kind of slow if you only recently realized that.
Instapundit Glenn Reynolds is (((   ))), never mind the “Reynolds” surname.

Actually, lad, I’ve been monitoring Instapundit since 9/11 and know exactly what it is and what they do. I derive a sort of great and hopeless amusement from their drooling stupidity. Especially Reynolds.  Got a sauce for the ((( ))) wrt Reynolds?

        Ironically if we did have a Caesar it would be Gavin Newsom.  A man of pure avarice and good breeding wielding power in a state that looks like a Roman Province full of brown hordes serving their hyper educated masters in their palatial coastal villas.   No middle class to speak of.  He’s a born Caesar chiseled from marble.  Had cocaine been synthesized in ancient times I’m sure the Caesars would have loved the nose candy just like him.

        A lot of wise thoughts, well expressed, in this column. But this one stood out to me as especially strong:
“…the ‘party of Lincoln’ thought they could fool all of the people all of the time.”
Just so. It cuts to quick the pretensions of the “conservatives” (especially the propagandistically-named Lincoln Project), while memorably exposing their contempt for the people they pretend to represent. Nice work.

        You have to ask yourself, why would anyone with an “R” beside their name want to be president in 2025-2028? The 30 million plus illegal immigrants have drained (and are continuing to drain) the social services that should be set aside for our elderly taxpayers, the military is now disheartened and filled with people who would have been kicked out of a recruiters office when I served, which will lead to the illegals ( who would happily turn their service weapons on citizens ), becoming the majority of the Armed Services. Police, who are not your friends, are already turning a blind eye to race crimes against Whites to protect their pensions, will ignore the upcoming riots should Trump (or any “R”) win the election. I really think that Trump is being persecuted to make him MORE popular to ensure a win. He takes over and the entire country suddenly goes to shit, ensuring that the leftists will be in power until Whites remember that historically they are the meanest, smartest, most ruthless SOB’s on the planet.

            I have been under the impression that whoever wins in 2024 is going to end up being the fall guy (or girl) for a lot of bad stuff. Kind of a Hoover. A reverse Bill Clinton.

                It would be a stroke of luck if this was stolen from Trump as it would finally transform our politics at a faster than glacial pace.  I’m absolutely unconvinced that the new “punished Trump” will be anything more than an old gelding with a big mouth wasting yet another four years while every world problem is pinned to him.   The system itself needs to be discredited among the most thick headed..

            ” the social services that should be set aside for our elderly taxpayers”
You can always tell who is a conservative. The first thing they want to do, for any problem whatever, is to run to the government for “help” – or at least the illusion of it.

                Maybe. Alternatively, if the point is that if one wants to encourage productive behavior, you don’t completely de-incentivize it. If you don’t give SOME return on investment in SS and Medicare, what’s the point of even being a taxpayer?
Do YOU buy financial products which promise to not only pay you no interest, but also not even preserve your principal?

                        We have massive generational divide right now. We get people collecting something called “Social Security” insisting that everyone is a loser for wanting socialism.
It’s so ridiculous to even think of it as a savings or investment program, but there it has to be because otherwise they are poor people on welfare.

                        Rando:  I don’t expect to get anything from Social Security.  I don’t want Medicare.  It’s irrelevant to me that the fedgov has taken tons of our money to ostensibly fund these bennies ostensibly for us, and then pissed it all away – that’s what it has always done.  Same with the tens of thousands it takes in taxes.But it’s always the same old song – no more foreign aid, no more welfare, give me MY social security.  They just don’t get that it was never their money in the first place  – maybe it was 200 years ago, but the past is a different country.

                PaulJ- Nope. Not a conservative. I don’t want to conserve a damn thing. I do, however, want what’s mine. According to my last SSA statement, the government has taken $298K from me over my 40+ years of work. I want it back. If they will just give it to me, I’ll sign away any future “benefits” they might want to permit, but you know that’s not going to happen. They simply don’t have it. Given away to every lazy bitch, bastard, illegal and “minority” they could find.

            I can understand why you would think this, but assuming the system “breaks” i would much rather the Republicans be in charge than the Democrats.  Just imagine the insane things they will want to push through in such a crisis.  Now, I also grant that the bulk of the political class, even the GOP side, are stupid, evil or both, so there is no guarantee they would be better able to deal with a broken system. Still, it’s hard to imagine them being worse.If the aliens break the system of social support, the Democrats will “fix” it by finally passing reparations or something.

        This line, sir, is H.L. Mencken-level quality:“It was a room full of people trained to fix something that was about to be replaced.”Spot on. I once thought they were playing their assigned role intentionally, and while conservatards did lead the lambs to slaughter, they mostly were oblivious to that reality. Now, of course, their Soma babble is obvious, but if they acknowledge even a little of what is actually happening their entire ideology is exposed as the fraud it always has been, no matter how sincerely it may have been espoused in the past.Excellent column. The move seems to have been good for you.

            Jack:  Nothing so clarifying as living amongst genuine White dirt heritage Americans.  We had a totally destroyed flat tire Christmas Eve day and lots of issues with switching cars with our son  etc., all one short holiday week before my husband has to drive hundreds of miles on another business trip.  I could write a very long comment on all the ways that so many friendly, courteous, professional, and genuinely good White people solved all our vehicular problems, along with a dollop of down-home wisdom and Christian goodwill, but suffice it to say that I thank God (and my husband) daily that I now live amongst rural southern heritage American Whites.

        We all saw the Russia hoax. We all saw 2020. So we should all know that there is a plan for eliminating the Orange threat in 2024. I expect that plan involves keeping him off the ballot, and in a more effective way than the Colorado gambit. I can’t predict precisely what it will be, I couldn’t have predicted the plandemic, but that doesn’t mean I don’t know it is coming, just as I knew “something” was coming then.Civnat G. Normiecon will happily turn out for Haley to in order to defeat Biden. Even some dissidents will. Importantly, the “left,” to include the foot soldiers of fortification, is not united behind Biden. Many will sit out, stay home, vote 3rd party, independents will break for Nikki. But while they are not united behind Biden, they are for damn sure united against Trump, and nothing could or would galvanize their support, and their fortification, like Orange on the ballot. So even if he does get on the ballot (dubious prospect), he has no better chance than he had in 2020. In other words, Trump is Biden’s only chance for a 2nd term.

            Except for the portion about Haley–she would put the final stake in the fading heart of the GOP, I would have agreed with you up until quite recently. For whatever reason, the Regime apparently now thinks they can keep their NPC’s from seceding if Trump goes back into office, and he can exhort his followers to die for “their” country.
I hope both of those things are wrong, of course.

                Even if, hypothetically, the top clouds have made their peace with another Trump term, there is nothing, zero, that they can do to get the great mass of the “left” to go along with it. The well is too poisoned. And that great mass of the “left” includes many high ranking people.
But tp be fair. the rehabilitation of Bush/Cheney does suggest that, given a decade, they could eventually do the same with Trump.

                    To be clear, I think the 2020 election was stolen precisely because the Regime knew the Left would flip out. Initially I did not think so but that’s what makes sense now. Do they really think the Left, which as you point out includes people well-positioned, can be kept in line? It seems it or the need for cannon fodder overrides that.

            Interesting, and this hinges on Normie’s response to the eventuality of Mean Tangerine being precluded from the ballot. You may be right and certainly BOM as bogeyman gets out the vote and cheat for Grandpa Stinkfinger. However, Normie’s response could be very different. Normie needs motivation to get off the couch and Trump gave them that. Without Trump on the ticket, Normie might prefer to watch reruns of J.A.G. instead of voting. Dickless Cheney appeals to very few normals outside of those with a fetish for grandmothers who smell like curry.  Her performance during the last “debate” at the hands of King Cobra was disastrous. Would self-styled independents (unreliable people) really vote for a nominee Granny Paneer when the entire media culture will paint her as Moustache Man’s niece?At any rate, the coming fortification will be something to behold. Some state Supreme Court (Pennsylvania?) has already ruled that their mail-in ballots must be counted *even if they lack a dated postmark.*

This is the popular wisdom of the DR. It’s also largely wrong, or possibly even projection. The “normies” I see every Sunday at church aren’t considering skipping the vote due to laziness, but because they are as sick of the “politics as usual” as you are. They see boycotting the vote as the only means left to them to effect change short of the 4th box.

The racial issue and the woman issue are the ONLY issues.  Cons are terrified to look in their direction and lost them a long time ago.  It’s been over for a long time.
Voting for Trump is just a protest vote.   In action, he sucks and proved it thoroughly as president.

            The advantage of a Trump election has absolutely nothing to do with policy or what he will or won’t do.  That ship sailed long ago, there is no hope for reform.  It has everything to do with acceleration and the response by the left.  The outrage from the lunatics will be like nothing else this country has ever seen, and it will usher us into the conflict that is necessary in order to rid ourselves of the virus people.

        The GOP is now just a containment vessel for the frustrations of Grillers. It has no intention of “winning” anything because “winning” isn’t its purpose. The last 8 years, when viewed in this light, become a lot more understandable.Basically Trump is running his “campaign” outside the parameters of the GOP even though he seeks the GOP “nomination”. This poses a serious dilemma for the GOP: does it risk publicly breaking with Trump and losing any shred of credibility, or does it leave itself open to uncontrollable “Red Caesars” going forward?I think the party apparatus has been paralyzed by this dilemma. Zman says they have run out of intellectual energy and I certainly agree. But I think the whole GOP project now is about energy dissipation/entropy.

            “The GOP is now just a containment vessel for the frustrations of Grillers. It has no intention of “winning” anything because “winning” isn’t its purpose”.  Just so!I was frustrated and baffled in 2012 when the GOP shut out the Ron Paul voters by banging the chairman’s gavel at the convention.  I thought they could have thrown the nutters a few bones and kept them in the big tent, instead of thoroughly pissing them off, which made them stay home on election day.Now I am wiser.  The party, as you say, doesn’t care about winning.  It cares about keeping the graft going by frustrating any popular/populist insurgency.  In that light, it makes perfect sense that they stiffed the Paulistas, and actively work against Trump.

            The time of keeping ’46 Chevy’s running and on the road is here, only it’s not Cuba and it’s not cars. I have a basement full of 20 year old appliances that I bought from auctions and fixed just to be able to have a fridge that doesn’t think it’s smarter than me, a furnace that doesn’t automatically go into “eco mode” when it’s 10 degrees outside and a washer that will actually let me fill it to a level that will clean clothes. Unfortunately, every other thing in my house that plugs into a wall is probably listening to everything I say.

                As 3D printers evolve they will eventually become little robotic tabletop factories capable of *assembly* as well as printing. I imagine that older designs for everything from washing machines to furnaces in digital form will become available along with “open source” novel ones to fill the need for home gadgets that actually work for anyone who needs them. Of course, the regime will try to outlaw this just like it has with 3D printed guns. I doubt this will ultimately be any more effective than keeping people from printing AR magazines has been. The Carbon Crazies and their “climate aware” designs are setting things up right now to spawn a whole basement industry of bootleg manufacturing.

            “We will look like Cuba in 1975.” Not quite. The Castro regime in 1975 could tell men from women, it hated negroes and sodomites, it did not mutilate the sex organs of children, and it did not allow the sexually degenerate into positions of authority.Our ruling elites resemble the patrician class of late Republican Rome, with a bit of Fellini thrown in. Our foreign policy resembles that of the Athenian Empire right before and during the Peloponnesian War. Our culture resembles that of Weimar.How did all of those work out? We await a Caesar, a Lysander, an Austrian guy with an odd moustache. All will arrive in due course.Should be fun. Sort of.

As I recall, Castro didn’t bother persecuting all those guys running their ’57 Chevys. He probably even quietly approved since the Cuban mechanics kept the island from being a total basket case. Our bugman commissars, however, will demand that every illegal nut, both, and screw be tracked down and vaporized – and that will be how the regime bankrupts itself.

        Dallas is only 28% White and way outnumbered by beaners and blacks.  This mayor undoubtedly was only elected due his magical negro status.  With those demos, a White republican has basically no chance going forward.  The old saying “don’t mess with Texas” is now a joke to be replaced by Texas is a mess…As a life long republican (and former voter), the idea of blacks joining up en masse would be the final nail in the supposedly conservative coffin – the absolute last thing anything needs is more freaking blacks.Finally, the idea that any intelligent, sentient being would vote for that warmed over non-american curry slag, Haley, is absurd.  However, as we’ve got two pajeets, a fat slob and high heel boot boy (to say nothing of a treasonous senile pedophile) left in the hunt tells us all we need to know about the state of this former country – never say never…

Unfortunately “intelligent, sentient” doesn’t apply to most voters.

        They have experienced two presidential cycles that went entirely against their interests, yet they have not done anything over the last eight years to prepare for this cycle.To be fair, the GOP really doesn’t need to prepare in any way because they really don’t care whether they win or lose.  Sure if they win it might be easier to give tax breaks and subsidies to their donor cronies, but even if they lose there will still be enough of them in D.C. to see to it that their donors still get to keep their noses in the trough.  All that winning does is force them to dither around for two years about campaign promises in hopes that the next election returns them to the minority and they can blame it on “wingnuts” and OrangeManBad.What I’m wondering now is whether they’ve resigned themselves to Trump winning the nomination.  I’m sure they’re still wanting to try every trick in the book to get him off the ballot, but maybe at some point they give up and just hope that Democrat voter fraud will win the day next November.

            I have started to think the GOP and larger system have resigned themselves to a possible Trump presidency. I would not have written such even two months ago. The reason likely is a bad one, too: they want whites to buy in and sacrifice their children to a war with China, Russia and/or Iran. White males in the South and Midwest are the only people left in the United States who are not totally defective and deranged and who still could fight a war for Israel and Jewish business interests. The good part is that the people they hope Trump lures back into the system are mostly done with it at an unconscious emotional level lock, stock and barrel. They still will stand for the anthem, but that’s about the extent of it. Not a small number would secretly laugh to themselves if a 9/11 Deux happens and not an insignificant number would think it likely a false flag.The anti-white racism chickens have come home to roost and the open borders have solidified the break or will do so. There will be no revolution, mind you, just indifference and a grudging tolerance as long as houses are warm and stomachs are full. The country will continue to dissolve and fracture, and when the bellies growl everything will be in place to separate.

                I’m still of the opinion that the regime will under no circumstances allow Trump to win the general election.  It’s too personal for them. If they don’t legally kneecap him, they’ll give us an uber-fortified election.  Optics be damned.

                    I would have agreed as recently as six or eight weeks ago but the Regime apparently thinks it can keep its unhinged NPC’s from peeling off now. That’s my perception, anyhow, and I hope it is wrong.

                I would like to think that among the younger men of the Deep South, there is less interest in the military and hence a disinterest in dying for Likud. Some of this is due to wokery, some possibly due to the ongoing desecration of Confederate memorials. The image of the statue of Robert E Lee (in my humble opinion the greatest man born on this continent) being melted was powerful in a way perhaps not intended.

                But Trump was resolute against the neocons on Iran, so they would need to replace him…But the fact of the matter is that any of those wars would destroy the USA, and I suspect that many in the Deep State are aware of that, so I doubt they will try…

            This brings to mind an observation (for which I have no attribution):Republican politicians are split in thirds. One third believes none of the conservative program and are actually progressives, but they have to disguise themselves as Republican to be elected. One third care nothing about policy, but only want to have the power that comes with elective office and will sway with the wind to survive. The last third are the only ones who believe the standard conservative catechism.So we have a full two thirds who are either plain woke, or willing to blow in that direction; they are guaranteed finks.

            “Sure if they win it might be easier to give tax breaks and subsidies to their donor cronies…”That is incorrect on its face. Leftie boilerplate. Every tax break (which really just means less armed robbery by the government) for ages has meant that the wealthy donor classes pay more in tax, not less. They have all been skewed heavily towards middle and upper middle class.Subsidies, same, same. The subsidies go heavily to progressive businesses and progressive businessmen. You don’t see subsidies to Moe’s Bar and Grill or Joe’s Plumbing. At best, they get the tax breaks you complain about.

        “National Review still puts out nonsense about how progressive cultural production is actually conservative.”
Even during the Shrub years, Con Inc. made me uncomfortable with all its efforts to justify cozying up to dominant pop culture. I recall how the noxious potato that is the offspring of neocon Norman Podhoretz fancied himself a movie reviewer. And of course there was  neocon Jonah I-Married-My-Mother Goldsomething who couldn’t stop drooling over children’s fare like Star Trek.

        Nature abhors a vacuum, which is why Trump exists. The system is lucky in that Trump is not very good at politicsHere’s my paranoid take:When you disenfranchise, demonize and and displace white people, a Hitler-shaped hole appears in the political landscape. The usual suspects know this, and to pre-emptively stop that hole from being filled with something else, they promote ineffectual buffoons like Trump, Farage, Wilders, Meloni and Le Pen.The reason they hate so much Trump is not because of who he is or because of his politics. They freaked out because one of the carnie acts who was just supposed to play the straw dog actually captured government power by mistake – they blame it on the voters, of course, but they transfer that frustration onto Trump.

            I suspect that Trump might have been tagged to play the role of Judas goat to lead whites to another blood-drenched war. The open border has soured so many people that it likely will not work, and it is unsettling that the Regime fails to recognize this.

                I suspect that Trump might have been tagged to play the role of Judas goat to lead whites to another blood-drenched war.
That doesn’t really compute because he didn’t start any wars.
I don’t think Trump was supposed to win; he didn’t even seem to believe that himself because he didn’t prepare for it.

                    “I don’t think Trump was supposed to win; he didn’t even seem to believe that himself because he didn’t prepare for it.”
He didn’t think he would even win the Republican nomination. He was just having a good time speaking his mind and perhaps promoting the Trump brand. He thought he’d be lucky if he placed second. Then he won the nomination and didn’t expect to prevail against the hildebeest. When he did he was “shocked and then horrified.” What had started out as fun and games had morphed into something serious.

                        InThe Candidate(1972), Robert Redford plays a Democrat running for a Senate seat in California against the popular Republican incumbent. He “can’t win” and so is free to “tweak the establishment”.
Of course, he ends up winning. The last scene of the movie is the Redford character looking at his campaign manager (played by Peter Boyle) and asking “what do we do now?”

            Plausible Felix. But…. All that would require a level of competence and intellect that none of those guys possess. If these guys actually WERE intelligent and competent, we wouldn’t have gone into the Kraine, Covid would never have happened, Obutthole and Biden would never have been allowed the positions they occupied. All of these things are incredibly bad for business.Just throwing this out there: what if no one is in control? What if all these grifts and cons are all separately run and controlled? Sure, there will be a few nodes where connected guys like Biden and the jewry may be involved in and/or running several grifts and cons at once… but – what if all this is just the result of our own apathy? We make fun of grillers because they’d rather watch sportzball and BBQ out on the deck rather than looking at what is actually happening. Are the rest of us any different? Sure… we notice the obvious and bitch about it… but nothing ever gets done. Why is that?My theory is that we are all grillers until the meat runs out. When we start getting hungry, THEN it will be time to spit on our hands and hoist the black flag and so forth. It’s a truism that people get the gov’t they want and deserve, and the polls confirm it. Somehow, guys like Biden and Trudeau have approval ratings of 30%. That’s a LOT of people. Stupid people, granted, but their demographic power cannot be denied.I think human beings are no different than those massive flocks of little birds that decide all at once to leap into the air, and form random fractile patterns that swirl and roil as the superflock tries to decide which way its going. If human beings actually COULD be controlled at that level… we’d have total world domination, and we’d have been in the pods, owning nothing and eating bugs a long, long time ago. It is my conviction that this nonsense will go on until we stop tolerating it.But whadda I know…?

                    “..there are some exceedingly clever people running the circus.”Maybe. I’m still leaning towards no one is running the circus per se, but rather each player is trying to advance his own interests — wealth, power, whatever motivates — and this all tends to move the same direction.For example, there’s certainly no genius level puppeteer behind Wray or Milley. Whether to further their own power, or because they are just that stupid, they behave as if  “white rage” or people who listen to mass in Latin are the real terrorist threat. And, to be fair, that will probably be the end result of their pograms…

        That is a lot of time on the National Review website.  Last I had seen they were only allowing subscribers to comment, but it looks like that may have changed that now.  I am curious how many more true believer comments the article about the black mayor of Dallas switching parties will get.  Someone made a good comment on the Home Alone column questioning how a superficial movie that pushes the dumb adult/clever kid combo is conservative.  But, hey the author is a lecturer at Yale, who are we to question him.

            I don’t think I ever saw the movie but I got the impression it was about a family so wrapped up in work/consume/display that they forget their son exists and nearly lose him to the predations of some “white ethnic” creeps. That’s conservative in a sense, but it’s not Republican-conservative.In fact the irresponsible family is Reagan-supporter “coded” according to the media cliches of the time. The image of the white left as economic winners hadn’t yet prevailed (but it soon would). They were about *having* rich parents, not *being* them—except on Thirtysomething, which invented the Clintons.Normal commercial movies aren’t really about anything, but they typically include a mess of current_year presumptions and shibboleths. Reading/remembering those things can be interesting. Yale and National Review can’t.

                Not really.  Home Alone is a slapstick comedy from the early 90s about a rich family in suburban Chicago that forgets one child at home when they go on vacation to Paris for Christmas.  There are two moron burglars going through the neighborhood and the 8 year old outsmarts them with various booby traps.  The mother has typical Christmas time travel issues trying to get home after they realize they forgot their son. John Candy plays the leader of a polka band that gives her a ride in their van. It is fairly harmless, but calling it a conservative movie just shows how desperate these saps still are for validation from the entertainment industry.

        The link to Jesse Kelly is interesting.  I pick him up on a Denver station.  He actually shows, at times, promise.  He flirts with the proper ideas and comes close to speaking the truth and then he talks of the “communists” being the problem.  That’s when I tune him out.  This thing is about race, not some 150 year old ideology.   Then, listening more, he shills for his Israel cruise.  He would be at home  in the NRO and in the tired old conservative circles of the 1980’s.

                Couldn’t agree more. As is famously said, “The Democratic Party is where progressive movements go to die.” It serves to rope off any real leftist movement and to tease and tantalise the left-leaning segment of the population with a Judas goat like Sanders. As for the “communist” moniker, gimme a break. Are they calling for nationalisation of the cartels and corporations that control economic and (to a large extent) political life in the US empire? No. They represent a certain sector of the oligarchy while the Repubs represent another. US “democracy” …. As Governor George Wallace (RIP) pointed out over 60 years back, there isn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two parties.

I’m not much impressed with people who want to maintain a distinction between democrats, communists, and progressives. They all amount to about the same thing in the end, a mad scramble for power. “Who does what to whom.” R’s are no different.

This is a good point, but really understates the problem. Fascism, whether you use Mussolini’s or Hitler’s description, is socialism within a nation’s borders, while the various strains of communism stress international socialism.
“Do you want America First Socialism or Citizens of the World Socialism?” is all that’s on the ballot. And often not even that. (Looking at you, Romney.)

            The only reason not to name them “commies” is that it costs independent voters who aren’t ready to admit just how far the policies of the US have shifted leftward. The important bit is to explain why (D)s are commies, not to leave it at what is generally considered an epithet.
Since the DR isn’t seeking to win any elections now, but rather to move the Overton Window, what’s the harm in calling a spade a spade?

                There are still heavy consequences for calling a spade a spade, even in your personal life. At some point when the Boomers go not so much but for now “Communist” is as good as it gets when talking about the JQ in public.

        “That is what you see on the debate stage at these debate shows. With the exception of Vivek Ramaswamy, who is a Trump catspaw, the rest are some versions of what you can see at the Reagan Museum. They skim over some of the cultural issues, but refuse to address the racial issues. If any of them noticed that there are no more white people in television ads, he would rocket up the polls. None of them mention these things because for all of them, the present is a foreign country.”The people funding these marionettes are anti-white. Ramaswamy can get away as a Trump epigone because he’s not white himself otherwise he’d be tarred with the same brush as Trump. You have the bizarre situation today that to speak for whites and white interests you have to be non-white yourself.

        I often wonder who the individual will be that will take the stage like a bolt out of the blue.
As Z wrote, if he responds to the question,”call me racist; I notice the world around me”, I wonder how many heads would explode.
To be honest, there are a few on this site that would do a much better job of leading whites out of the darkness, including Z, than anyone currently running.

            Exactly.  Or, put another way – I’m waiting for the person who does NOT begin their sentence with: ‘I’m not racist, but…’The head explosion scale would register an 11 on a scale of 1 – 10.

        Professional Team R politicians have just conceded that the Great Replacement has reached a point of no return. The party exists to carve out scraps from the table while existing on the margins.
In ten years, maybe sooner, Texas will be as blue and as unassailable as California. 30 years from now no one will believe they were ever red.
It’s no accident Texas has been slammed for so long or as had with the blessings of immigration as Texas.

            ProZNoV:  Texas passed the point of no return, demographically, at least a decade ago.  And the old White repukes who remain vote for people like Cornyn and Abbott and George P. Bush.  Texas absolutely flips to the ‘D’ column within 4-8 years.  As far as 30 years, I expect not to be around by then but seriously doubt the GAE will be either.

        The system is very lucky when it comes to Trump. A Caesar would not have spent 2020 sleepwalking through the year and would, on that day, have pointed to the Capitol and told his zealots to kill every living thing inside.
But Caesar was not a merchant.

            I remember a time when the ruling class/Left/tyrants in charge would’ve used subtlety to remove/disqualify Trump. The diversity has now overwhelmed them and guile has been replaced with clumsy aggression.I have no doubt Trump will be eliminated from the ballot. The clumsiness is how these girlboss/diversity hire types are doing it piecemeal with these ridiculous charges with these kangaroo courts filled with shitlib/diverse jurors that will always vote to convict.The problem for the ruling class is that the guy that comes after him hopefully won’t be as malleable.Watching the GOP field, with the exception of the hilariously entertaining Vivek, is an exercise in misery. They trot out the same old tax cut/invade the world/invite the world BS talking points while the country drowns in an invasion of dusky foreigners eager to feast on the desiccated husk of this country and in a debt cyclone that can’t be swept under the rug any longer.Nobody talks about how the culture is inherently hateful of the founding stock, except Vivek, who’ll be lucky to have a career and a free life when the ruling class tires of his act. Nobody talks about the great replacement, except for Vivek.Yet the GOP candidates talk like its 1984, Morning in America, all of that jazz. They’re the Washington Generals of politics. Graceful losers who provide legitimacy to the psychopathic theocracy ruling the nation with an iron fist.
