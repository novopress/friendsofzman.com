        It’s why you let the gears of justice do their work. I think businesses that rely on the good will of the public (sports teams, TV, Film, radio, etc) have to show they are concerned when one of their people gets jammed up. In this case, the school could have suspended the player until his case was adjudicated. But, mobs never accept that. They want blood.We have foolishly handed a veto to madmen and lunatics. The breakdown of the old order over the last three generations has made it possible for the worst elements to seize control. It will not end well.

        This goes a long way in explaining Sabin’s attitude at the press conference.  It’s highly likely that he knew the situation in total by then but was still forced to cut the boy due to the pressure of political correctness.

        Is the “knockout game” a form of mob justice? Is it the righteous retribution of savage mobs driven by wild and furious passion? Do accounts of outrages committed by feral Negro mobs form the everyday news of today? Do Obama and Holder, by remaining silent, tacitly indorse these attacks? Are we in the midst of Civil War II?

        From a very early age I was told not to ever intervene if you see a couple falling out. The chances were the female would not welcome your assistance and may even turn on you with the male.
Being beaten up by a man and a woman for trying to keep the peace may be a bridge too far. I don’t envy the cops being called out to a ‘domestic.’
