        Notice how Mask Enforcers, when shown that their face diapers won‚Äôt prevent Covid, morphed their argument from ‚Äúit‚Äôll keep you safe‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs polite.‚Äù

And now we have a situation where masks will never go away.  Based on the current logic, they‚Äôll be with us until the end of time.

            Notice that when people can hide behind a mask they become like shit posters in social media? Saying things or acting in a way that they normally wouldn‚Äôt.

                Actually, no.  The mask people are enabled by our GloboHomo culture.
Is there something else you‚Äôre trying to get at here?

                Now there are mask nazis everywhere.  My area had been pretty slow to wear the masks, but now most stores have people walking around checking that everyone is dutifully wearing masks or enforcing a one out one in strategy.

                    I tell any mask nazis that I would wear his/her mask if I could give them my congestive heart failure. That comment plus I move in close for a fight if they want has shut up the two who dared talk to me.

                        You cannot legally question a person with a support animal about why they need it. The same logic should apply to mask non-wearers. The reasons are medical and thus protected from casual inquiry.

                My county and city went all in on face mask mandate.  This grounded me more or less for two weeks as I refuse to wear a mask in public (hospital/nursing home exceptions of course).Then I got an idea which makes wearing the mask *enjoyable*.  I bought this type of mask:https://www.ebay.com/i/202991741224?chn=ps&amp;var=503180070056&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;itemid=503180070056_202991741224&amp;targetid=915282956376&amp;device=t&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9030261&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=9338046206&amp;mkgroupid=94263569666&amp;rlsatarget=pla-915282956376&amp;abcId=1139336&amp;merchantid=113736954&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwi_b3BRAGEiwAemPNUzGrb21FxDT-PpxgIyIzOIvCmD4blvqtkbFcZtd6T8h0V8SZI8xxTxoCg8IQAvD_BwEIt is used in air soft gun play or paintball action.  Look carefully, you will see it‚Äôs a valid mask with wire screening instead of cloth, therefore zero ‚Äúprotection‚Äù against Covid-19.  It is wonderful. An absolute in-your-face statement made plain to all who see you wearing it.Not yet tossed out of a store, but I hope it catches on.

                    I‚Äôve yet to wear a mask, but if it comes down to it, I‚Äôm getting a WWI gas mask. Hopefully that mask will scare the piss out of the Karens even more than a person wearing no mask at all.

                Eric Peters of EricPetersAutos.com, frequently featured at LewRockwell.com, was the first person I either read or heard use that phrase.
Nobody, and I mean nobody, has been as accurate as he has with calling BS on this hoax ab initio.
Nobody, and I mean nobody, has been as relentless in their ridicule of Covid cultists as he has been.
Yeah, and he just so happens to be a hard-core, paleo-libertarian.

            That was the key for the masks. It was when the media pushed that their main purpose was to protect others, not yourself, that the masks gained huge popularity with the scolds, especially, as always, women. The masks became a morality test, and the scolds ate it up.
)Btw, I‚Äôm pretty sure that masks do slow the spread. My problem has always been that I didn‚Äôt understand why we‚Äôd want to slow the spread as long as there was no stress on the system.)

Quite Accurate.
Note how the Left succeeded by grabbing the moral high ground.  This is a great example for your NormieCon friends of why ‚Äúowning the Libs with facts and logic‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work.

                For at least the first 2 months finding masks was extremely difficult.  People are wearing the same masks over and over.  This has to be worse than no mask at all.  You get the moisture from your breath in these masks which are then shoved in pocketbooks or pockets, which is a perfect way to grow cultures.

                    I pointed this out on another forum I post in.  I noted that, first of all, there‚Äôs no good evidence that randomly built hillbilly masks protect people from anything.  I further added that, even if the masks slow the spread of Beer Flu, walking around with a mask full of bacteria and (other) viruses on all day is probably going to cause more disease overall than it prevents, especially given that Beer Flu just isn‚Äôt very serious for most people who get it.  There‚Äôs also the problem of CO2 build-up, particularly in homemade masks.The closest thing I saw in the mass media to any consideration of this was after many weeks of mask propaganda.  They trotted out some medical type and had the anchor-bot ask some canned, softball questions about CO2, to which the medical guy had glib, canned answers.This is a very basic process of reasoning, where one considers both the costs and benefits of one‚Äôs actions.  That it is absent completely from the media, and that the bulk of the population seems incapable of applying it themselves suggests disaster ahead.

                            Haha!  That‚Äôs great CS!  I might get one of those tactical things.  If you have to wear a mask might as well wear something that scares the hysterical little shits around you.  Right now, I just tie a bandana around my face.  It‚Äôs incredibly amusing that I can walk into a store like that and people just nod instead of calling the cops.  I‚Äôve also thought about getting a Bane mask and shaving my head.  Need to pack on some more muscle to make that work though.

                        A watched a YT video put up on the internet by a guy who deals with OSHA compliance in a mill or something.  There are OSHA standards for the O2 level in the air and he had a meter that measured O2 as a percentage of the atmosphere.  He stuck it in his mouth and showed the reading, which was still above the allowed level.  He then put on a mask with the sensor in his mouth and a few seconds the 02 level immediately plummeted to well below the minimum OSHA requirements.Though I haven‚Äôt verified it, I have heard places like LA are saying you must wear masks at all times when outside of your home. Peak idiocy.

                            I saw the video as well. I think there might be something to it.To wit, here in my local ACE Hardware store, there are several employees *not* wearing the mask. There are signs all around asking the customers to please be kind and understand that some people (i.e., the ACE Staff) can‚Äôt wear the mask for prolonged periods of time *due to breathing difficulties*.I even spoke to one mask-less employee and asked if that included myself if I felt the need, she said yes.Indeed, our local ordinance/proclamation by TPTB states that one need not wear the mask due to ‚Äúhealth‚Äù difficulties *and further* no law enforcement agent of the City/County was allowed to question what the health concern was (HIPPA violation). üòâGawd, I love it when these Leftists get tied up by their own bullshit.

            ‚ÄúAnd now we have a situation where masks will never go away.‚Äù
They‚Äôll go away as soon as Biden wins. The feds can‚Äôt have a situation where the masses avoid 24/7 face ID, now can they?

                    There may be some truth to that. Women love wearing make-up because they‚Äôre obsessed with their appearance, moreso than men at least. A mask might be a convenient way for an unattractive woman to hide her appearance, and unattractive women love tormenting their attractive rivals. I could see Karen telling Linda she has to cover up. Remember, in many Islamic societies (and in Christian society of old) it‚Äôs not just the government but peer pressure from women which encourages other women to cover themselves. Witness the number of single female Islamic immigrants who walk around in packs in your neighborhood who go around wearing headscarves ‚Äî no men in sight. I could see this catching on, maybe even moving to adopting Islamic head garb as a compromise for the face mask.

                        This is thought-provoking. There‚Äôs this Procrustean-bed thing with masks where attractiveness-outcomes are evened out. I do a lot of physicals, so I see people with a mask on for a few minutes and then I have them remove it when it‚Äôs time to say ah. It is fun to try to project what the rest of the face is going to look like. I‚Äôm usually way off the mark, but I‚Äôm better with women than with men. Probably means I‚Äôm not gay, nothing more.

            Its complete crap.  went in for an XRAY, half the staff were not wearing masks in the operational areas, most of the female nurses were. The consultants were swanning about without even white coats as per normal.I was asked to wear one and simply said without getting irritated ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt wear one‚Äù. The receptionist did not know what to do but surprisingly the assertion seemed to be all she required and let me through  into the waiting area where 3 middle aged women were sat 6 feet apart wearing masks and staring into their phones.A mother and young son came in together and a passing nurse tutted and made them sit 6 feet away from each other in the waiting room for no reason.As I was leaving 3 nurses were huddled together outside for a smoke and a gossip with their masks round their necks.Everyone‚Äôs heuristics are screwed because apart from a small number of nutters and women re-enforcing what they think is the rules where they think scolding is needed its obvious hardly anyone believes its true by observing their actions, but to hear them talk to patients you would think we all had some form of doomsday virus.

            Nobody said it would be perfect. Safer, not safe. If you need a simple thought experiment, consider the difference between a person who‚Äôs infected wearing a face mask vs no face mask and letting fourth a powerful sneeze. In the first case the cloth of the mask stops nearly all the droplets, in the second you have effectively put an aerosol Mist into a large cubic volume of airspace going to expose many people to it.

        Was in the original epicenter. Once you take out the old folks that Cuomo, Murphy and the goof in PA murdered and mass intubation (which is now quietly acknowledged as a mistake) even the numbers here were not that bad. When antibody testing first started here the numbers were widely reported and suggested actual infection rates well in excess of 20% (two months ago). Testing of some focused populations in the city came back as high as 50%‚Ä¶then the numbers very quietly disappeared. And barely mentioned in local media.

        The eternal mask is a necessary social test. They need feedback on how passive we‚Äôre willing to be.  This is necessary because  the shit test we are going to be subjected to under BLM social engineering are going to be epic. The willingness to darn the mask is a weather vane‚Ä¶and a bit of a pressure relief valve from darkie fatigue.  If you have two crises to deal with your ability to focus energy on dealing with the more serious one gets fragmented and misdirected. They use the same strategy over and over and we play along over and over.

        The Retardovirus sure has hell took hold, no mask will help with that.Some of my recent observations on this:1.Deaths are up now, business ones that is. In my area there is an increasing amount of long standing mom and pops going out.Some really have affected the community.2.Increasingly the Trump administration is caving on masks. They may be a part of life for a long time.3.Rolling lockdowns are common now just like third world energy grids.4.Small businesses are getting no help financially with these mandated lockdowns. This is an obviously planned to do harm.5.Another disease has infected white people probably decades early. It‚Äôs effect is a total lack of will to survive as if it lifeforce is¬†¬†spent.6.Russiagate, Ukrainegate, Impeachment, Covid scare, BLM riots. All in less than a year. What do you see here?7.Finally, what kind of pandemic is this? Most people can name only one or two peripheral people in their lives that have this. Hell, the¬†family Christmas party last year we had many people sick with the flu from that. That was viral.

                        If it is as easily transmitted as many claim, the large-scale testing of the general asymptomatic population will provide evidence. Also, if it is that easily transmitted and the large majority of those infected build immunity while remaining asymptomatic, I say bring it on as quickly as possible and get it over with while we‚Äôre still paying attention. Masks will only delay the inevitable and cause greater hardship.

                    Here in the great nursing home that is Japan, most places just have the hand sanitizer bottles/sprayers sitting out. I‚Äôm convinced they‚Äôre just full of water at this point. Most people use them, some don‚Äôt. Just about everyone still wears a mask in public spaces. You won‚Äôt get ridden for not wearing one, though.The worst thing is wearing a mask and gloves to eat at some restaurants (buffets) and getting your temperature taken before entering some stores. Foreigners are pretty rare right now and will be for the foreseeable future. Everyone realizes America/Europe dropped the ball on COVID, too. For one ‚Äì the places ‚Äúhit hardest‚Äù with the flu are all immigrant friendly; two ‚Äì sure the disease is fake and gay, but the reaction to it anyhow was an utter failure and hinted at the disaster a real pandemic might bring.When I walk my dogs in the morning, it‚Äôs annoying to see the old people shambling around at the same time suddenly throw on their mask when the round eye passes them,  but whatever. A lot of these people I‚Äôve known for years and I really can‚Äôt take it personally.

                        Because if a small businessman sticks his neck out of his self-imposed foxhole, he will be singled out and targeted by the agents of the powers-that-be.  It‚Äôs not right, but it is how it works now.  They are caught in the banking‚Äîlocal permitting‚Äîneighborhood exposure matrix.  When a lot of (ex) small businessmen have nothing more to lose, they will be free to act spicier.

                    Because National Review conservatives share blame in wrecking the economy, outside of the virus‚Äôs direct effects or the effect of the lockdowns themselves. Therefore, attention has to be redirected to something trivial that, in the end, will only make them look as dumb as usual and help the other side ‚Äî masks.Conservatives supported outsourcing for decades. That created a fragile gig &amp; service economy open to sudden collapse upon the slightest disturbance. They also foolishly shut down the economy without having a plan to preserve jobs. Why didn‚Äôt they pay employers to not fire people instead of bailing out multinational left-wing corporations? If they weren‚Äôt willing to do that, why did they even bother with lockdowns in the first place?On top of that, their proposition nation rhetoric has been exposed as a fraud. Pile in millions of people with no common bonds and watch them fight it out in the streets when the economy crashes. Additionally, the situation exposes the bankruptcy of modern American conservatism: the people tearing down those statues are mostly brainwashed White leftists taught to hate themselves. The GOP‚Äôs hands off approach to education (and everything else) really messed things up. Multiply that by about a thousand other observations and you‚Äôll have the real reason why we have to deflect to something dumb like scolding people for exercising their freedom to wear a surgical mask in public: the truth is too painful to confront.Questions are being asked. Hey look over there, a guy wearing a mask!

            There‚Äôs nothing wrong with wearing a mask. As Anatoly Karlin has reported, there is evidence they make a difference by reducing the peak incidence and, perhaps, even ultimate IFR by reducing initial exposure, which is correlated with disease severity. I‚Äôve seen nothing on this website that credibly challenges that. The public supports wearing masks and you people are busy denouncing people as retards for it. SMH. All is lost. I‚Äôve long speculated the left has a higher verbal IQ than the right. I think they do. They instinctively understand politics better than you do, so they will win in the end.

                    Compsci, he is a troll who wandered over from Unz.  Thus his appeal to ‚Äòauthority‚Äô of Karlin, his lionizing of Sailer, etc.  There are plenty of people I respect, butnonewho are beyond any criticism or questioning.  So you present study ‚Äòx‚Äô and he‚Äôll counter with ‚Äòy‚Äô and ‚Äòz.‚Äô  That sort of spergy troll.

To that effect, once in a while, it seems good to stop making gratuitous statements and reference something outside my personal thoughts/experience.I sent that reference to my doctor who thought it wise to send all his patients e-mail to wear masks in public.  His email even had diagrams showing infection rates/probabilities between masked and unmasked people and so forth.I asked for ref‚Äôs to the studies he must be citing.  Never heard from him again.

        Our practice is now almost all-Covid, all the time. From putting much of our staff on half-time for April and May, because everyone was afraid to come to the doctor, in June we did record numbers all month.Let me tell you about the patients and why this happened. As testing became easily available, HR departments started pushing for employers to test everyone. Two of the biggest employers in this area did so and then sent us their positives.About half of our ‚Äòappointments‚Äô now are telemedicine. Couple dozen a day, all Covid. The overwhelming majority that I‚Äôve seen (all but one) have not been sick. The list of approved symptoms keeps growing and they still can‚Äôt make the cut.This is the wimpiest killer virus I‚Äôve encountered, population-wise. The old, ill and infirm can fall to it in hours, and most of those who will probably already have.Given the propensity that this virus has to spread and its surprising but now-obvious ability to thrive even in hot, dry environments (I‚Äôm in saguaro territory), and the fact that there isn‚Äôt going to be effective vaccination or curative treatment in years if not decades, and assuming it doesn‚Äôt simply vanish on its own as SARS did 16 years ago, it is reasonable to expect that everyone is going to be exposed to this over the next few years.It would be reasonable for people like me, retirement age and with some medical problems, to have it now. I will only get older and less well in the future.No one is wearing a mask to protect me. Not even me.

                We have to play the game according to Arizona and our county. We did not wear or require masks until early June. Now we have the moon-suit MA at the door to greet you, interrogate you, scan your temp, mask required.   One small victory was that I was able as medical director to exempt the clinic from our corporate regs coming out of California, which would have been far more effective at bankrupting us.

                I don‚Äôt have particular expertise in this area, but airborne makes the most sense. Think of it this way: the virus needs to get into your lungs. Inhaling it is much more efficient than having it on your lips or tongue from having touched your mouth.

                    Which is why I chafe so at the notion that wearing a mask is to protect others.  Yes, yes, I get the bit about a mask catching a certain amount of droplets, but ultimately, wearing a mask is going to have more of an effect on one‚Äôs own health than that of the people around you.  Unless, that is, they‚Äôre telling us that these are miracle materials that stop the egress of particles but have no effect on the ingress.  So, you wear your mask if it makes you feel better and stop worrying about me.At any rate, it appears that sustained contact is necessary to infect.  Does anyone remember hearing of a mass-spreader event in a supermarket or home improvement store prior to everyone wearing masks.  The virus was at its peak in March, well before we went crazy about masks.  Shouldn‚Äôt we have had major outbreaks in shopping centers?  If we had, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd have never heard the end of it.  Thus, why require masks where contact is only fleeting?

        One interesting aspect of the Covid scare has been how it has shown how much upper middle-class White women miss the society of their ancestors. A hundred years ago or so when religion and social etiquette were an important part of society and everyday life, Nice White Ladies (NWLs) had a very clear set of rules to judge other Whites.And did they judge. Not only could they point out other people‚Äôs flaws (especially other women), they had endless topics of discussion with their friends.But as society moved to being more accepting and lost religion, NWLs had a much tougher time judging. Sure, they could judge people for judging, but that just wasn‚Äôt as much fun. Also, the rules weren‚Äôt as clear so couldn‚Äôt always be sure everyone would back them up.Covid changed all that. It was like they were thrown back to the 1800s ‚Äì and they love it. There‚Äôs a general set of rules, the specifics of which are told to them each day by TV or Facebook. There are clear markers for who is following the rules (masks, anyone) and they will be backed by the full force of government and other women if judge someone. It‚Äôs perfect.The Floyd riots were a nice bonus, but those rules have been around for a while and now everyone is chanting the same lines, so not much opportunity for scolding. Also, they don‚Äôt really want to be around blacks, which is a bit of an issue.Covid has shown NWLs what they‚Äôve been missing. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to give it up too easily.

            Good point, apparently they‚Äôll organize a summit in 2021 in order to create a new type of economy &amp; remodel western world even further, fourth industrial revolution they call it.Many more environmental policies will be implemented, diversity will be forced even further down white people‚Äôs throats, inclusivity, world community, the stuff of nightmares.

                More than that. Einstein famously advocated for world government in the 1950s. Other notable scientists and boffins of all types have expressed such ideas, almost always in conjunction with a belief in socialist economics, since the 1920s and 1930s. These same people were usually either quietly or openly pro-Soviet and pro-Stalin.The global Left now has almost universal support among the billionaire class and has thrown off the crude Stalinism and attachment to command economies of the past. The new push is going to be just this kind of thing from Davos. The new model is going to be ‚Äúmanaged capitalism‚Äù with the managers being the current oligarchs operating through an increasingly de facto world government composed of NGOs and ‚Äúprivate charities‚Äù. The power in this model is that many of these NGOs actually do useful things ‚Äì while spreading a vicious Leftist ideological cancer as well.The Left has the advantage in that their ideology is already explicitly trans-national. There‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt do the same though. I would propose that we create a global political party or parties of our own that people could join while remaining part of whatever national party they like at home. The globally organized party will simply emphasize a few basic ‚Äúright wing‚Äù tenets.Freedom of associationPolicies that aid in formation of traditional families (men work and women mind the home and educate children ‚Äì primarily, this needn‚Äôt be rigid)Mostly free market economies but‚Ä¶Strict limits on trade and immigration and recognition that a nation, any nation, is its people, not its land, not words on a page, but the specific people living in it and government must serve them.Policies that discourage financialization of economies and heavy reliance on debt.Personal autonomy including sub issues like‚Ä¶(6a) Gun rights and right to self defense in general(6b) Right to refuse to wear a ‚Äúuniform‚Äù (e.g. masks) in public(6c) Right to refuse invasive mandatory medical interventions (e.g. Bill Gates‚Äô brain/vaccine chip)EXTREME skepticism of anything that reeks of ‚Äúrule by crisis‚Äù or ‚Äúrule by extraordinary claims‚Äù. Had people applied this to Covid-19, for example, the economy would still be working. A similar principle must be used to evaluate things like global warming.Americans tend to be a bit parochial about everything and for a reason. We can afford to be because whatever starts here, for good or ill but these days mostly ill, goes everywhere thanks to our empire and media. This gives us an advantage though. We can start this thing here and spread it everywhere too.Our hypothetical party should also set up it‚Äôs own auxiliary charities and NGOs to utilize the same helping-with-strings-attached approach of the Leftists. Not every medical doctor or scientist is on board with the direction things are going. Many probably don‚Äôt join existing organizations because they know all too well what their authoritarian politics are. Indeed I think this is essential. The oligarchs have already gotten a head start building their shadow world government but we can build our own the same way. Our tentacles can span continents just the same as theirs. Unlike theirs, ours can be a loose federation of states that need not all follow directives from the top. Theirs is a pyramid ‚Äì and will be even more in the future. Ours can be a network organized around love of freedom, family, and autonomy.I welcome any ideas about what aspects of this kind of organization others may know of that already exist of course.Sorry, the sub-item functionality of the lists doesn‚Äôt seem to work quite right. 7-9 are really sub-items of 6.

        What‚Äôs been interesting from the beginning of all this ‚Äì at least in Virginia ‚Äì is that the governor/state official and local officials refuse to give any criteria/benchmarks for moving from one phase to another. They never say, ‚ÄúWell, when the 15-day moving average of deaths reaches 20 or less, we move to Phase 3, 10 or less to Phase 4 and 5 or less we end any lockdown.‚Äù
Nope. You just have to trust their judgement.

        Flew Southwest this past weekend. Must wear a mask to get on the plane but get in the air then the stewardess announces that due to Coronovirus soda and alcohol will not be served but water and pretzels will and we can take off our masks to eat and drink!So just tell me you want to save money by not serving soda instead of the bullcrap that there is a difference in serving water or soda.Two seats up a 3 year old vibrant was josling about without a mask on the entire flight.I sat and took my time sipping on water and nibbling pretzels without a mask with no consequence.Its all pure madness.

Our ¬°science! tells us that only one possible disease vector, eg a pint of ale, is bad, whereas multiple possible disease vectors, eg poutine walked through two cooks, an open air kitchen line, and a server, make that pint of ale much safer.

                You can bring small bottles of liquor if you put them in a plastic sandwich bag (i.e. the security theater crap you have to do for liquids). I think you aren‚Äôt technically supposed to drink alcohol you brought on the plane, but who cares? If the airlines aren‚Äôt serving soft drinks, you can‚Äôt make a mixed drink but under the circumstances, you probably need to drink it straight.

                    That‚Äôs in violation of Federal law and will attract the wrong kind of attention when opening your own stash on the plane.There are two strategies to use:If the plane does serve liquor, bring your own bottles on, i.e. if you get the little bottles of Jim Beam on the plane, switch it out with your own as it goes empty.My preferred strategy is to keep the little liquor bottles, but fill them with something high octane to reduce travel weight/hassle, and then before boarding I will buy a soda, go to the bathroom and dump out a little bit and replace that ‚Äòlittle bit‚Äô with the liquor bottle contents.For any critics, there was one time when I didn‚Äôt follow these strategies and I was stuck in a giant de-icing queue in Denver and I promised myself ‚Äúnever again‚Äù.

In for a penny, in for a pound.A similar point was brought up a few months ago by Bruce Schneier, who writes on security matters, wrt the TSA increasing their limit on passenger liquids being taken in hand luggage such that bottles of hand sanitizer that could now be brought on board.  He has for years said that the limits for amounts of liquids brought on by passengers was arbitrary and capricious.Covid-19 proved him right.

                Incorrect. Exposure to the virus depends on virus load and that is directly proportional to the amount of time you had your mask on or off.

                    Exposure is not contagion, nor proof one way or another that you *will* or will *not* get the disease or just how severe it will be if you do.Second point, please reference one published study (on COVID viral load) which proves your statement?  What you say is suspected, but not shown in the scientific literature wrt to COVID that I am aware of.  It also doesn‚Äôt make sense (as I can see it both ways) so I‚Äôd like to see the literature‚Äînot opinion by ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.A single virus can multiply to 1000‚Äôs in one cell in a few hours, the few thousand to a few million in a day.  Given such a exponential rate of growth/spread, does a starting point of 1 virus particle or 10,000 make much difference in 24-48 hours?  That‚Äôs one way to look at it.I can also see the argument that people have innate immunity in many cases and smallish exposure can be handled quite well in that manner, whereas larger exposures overwhelm such initial actions.Where are the studies?

            I flew American from Las Vegas to Philadelphia yesterday.  Flight attendant sternly warned that if you didn‚Äôt keep your mask on the whole flight you might never be allowed to fly American again.  (I was tempted to ask where I could sign up for that, but at heart I‚Äôm really a pussy.)  Passenger across the aisle had his mask off while he was attempting to calm his child ‚Äì who appeared to be autistic ‚Äì and, in support of the female-scolds-love-the-mask- requirement hypothesis, the sissy-boy ‚Äúmale‚Äù FA shrieked at him that he must wear his mask.

                Yes. The hysteria will evaporate to the day after the election. Notice how the communist scum (but I repeat myself) never objected to the unmasked rioters packed together? It‚Äôs merely political weaponry, to be disposed of after the election. Given the constraints he‚Äôs faced Trump has played it about as well as it could be played.

        The mask is the new secular burka.  It‚Äôs a unisex burka.  It represents modesty, piety, and submission towards elitist bureaucrats who promote ‚Äúthe Science.‚Äù   If you don‚Äôt wear a mask, you don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúthe Science.‚Äù  Science is a system to test models and theories.  The Science is a given ‚Äútruth‚Äù which is then later supported by models and theories.  Even a drug can be outed by ‚Äúthe Science‚Äù (Hyroxychloroqine).  It was abruptly pronounced ineffective one day because an orange blob that The Science hates tweeted about it.   Sadly, while one can submit to The Science, there is no achievable redemption by The Science.  Human beings, especially the white ones, are merely cockroaches to one day be exterminated with no attainable afterlife in the ample bosom of Gaia.

        The level of humiliation associated with these masks is very high. My gym just started following the county regs requiring a mask whenever you‚Äôre not actively working out. That means a mask at the front desk, worn while you walk down the hall, and allowed to be taken off when you get to the workout floor.It‚Äôs pointless, which is the point. If some jack wagon at the county health department said to wear a clown nose because reasons, those little snots would be hectoring everyone to wear the clown nose.Flipping the switch from partisan to hostile is exactly right.

        After giving free rein to looting and rioting because of fentanyl floyd the State and County governments have shut down all the beaches here in So Cal for the 4th of July weekend. The symbolism is so subtle you could cut it with an axe. They hate America with a deep blue passion.As far as making some intergenerational sniping about this, I notice that few of us tired ass boomers will wear the things. The old farts are the angriest, and most adamant. It‚Äôs the twenty-somethings, and younger running around on their skateboards and bikes who are masked up like they‚Äôre visiting the plague ward. Ditto with the thirty somethings driving with the windows up, and the masks on. And, of course, every Asian of any age.This, to me, is the worst sign possible. The younger folks are staring into their smart phones,locked into their media feed 24/7. If it doesn‚Äôt come across twitter, or YT, or FB, or instagram, they don‚Äôt see it. I don‚Äôt think many of them have ever looked at one of these old-fashioned weblog things.The end game with masking, like the passionate support of BLM, is humiliation. Who will go willingly into the darkness? Who will bend a knee to the stupidest and most violent? Who receives the revealed Truth from the Network? In recent days the number of faceless has exploded. They‚Äôre everywhere, and it‚Äôs creepy as hell. But knowing how it creeps out the ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù is, no doubt, part of the appeal.JWM

                    He could have countered the shutdowns by ordering the governors and mayors to stop their usurpation of the constitutional rights of their citizens.
He could have threatened the arrest of any governor or mayor who refused and if they persisted, he could have arrested them.
A real leader would have so acted.

                        There was no benefit to him stopping the governors from hitting themselves in the face with a hammer. On the contrary, he would have gotten into a huge fight they were begging him to engage in, and one he probably would have lost, as the legality of measures taken in each state are dependent on the various state constitutions and best countered through state courts not Presidential intervention.

            We‚Äôre also testing asymptomatic people, which has never happened with the flu before. Part of the problem is that we no longer have to use the nasopharyngeal swab (that goes way to the back of the nasal cavity), which was a big deterrence to unneeded testing, and rightly so‚Äìit is very unpleasant. Now, a simple swab of the nose and anyone can be tested painlessly.I always ask my fellow lab NPCs, what do you think would happen if we tested everyone for Epstein-Barr Virus? It is known to cause some very nasty diseases (including Mononucleosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome). Yet, nearly every adult will test positive for antibodies and have never had symptoms of any related illness. There‚Äôs no vaccine for that either.In short, we‚Äôve never before done wide-spread testing of asymptomatic people just to see who had a history of exposure. That was probably a good idea.

                Exactly. They have nlp‚Äôd ‚Äúpositive‚Äù with ‚Äúsick‚Äù, which of course is practically death.
Instead of ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù being evidence of a high level of natural protection, a good thing, it has been turned into the implicit selfishness of the silent spreader; a dangerous threat to others.
The only thing more disgusting to me than how they twist reality before our very eyes is how easily most people will pretzel themselves right along with the serpentine narrative.
All those face diapers make sense given how far up their own asses they have placed their heads.

        This spasm of insanity will mirror the Y2K faux crisis of late 1999, when the same media was pitching worldwide technological collapse to be brought on by software malfunction that supposedly would occur exactly as the clock struck midnight on December 31, 1999. And on January 1st, miraculously, the sun rose and world did not collapse, and the story disappeared almost immediatey. And no one apologized for attempting to incite a panic, or even just being monumentally stupid. Ditto, the Wuflu.

            I have mixed feelings on Y2K.
There were systems and interfaces out there that could have been affected by the two-digit year limitations.
However, there was an effort to take targeted, effective action to update those systems prior to the rollover.
Since that action was effective, it made Y2K seem like a non-event.
You see similar stories pop up about GPS, which is a mission-critical system for the US. Targeted, effective action is taken to mitigate the bugs, and they become a non-event for the vast majority of users.

                Re: GPSYou know, one of the truly remarkable things that have occurred in my lifetime is GPS. Say what you want about modern technology, but it finally answered one of the most common and tragic age-old questions: Where the hell am I?I was navigating ships around the globe in the years just before and during the invention of the Global Positioning System. I have found my way by LORAN, radar, stars, sight and extensive dead-reckoning. While navigation used to be a beautiful art and science at the same time, it has sadly become a lost art.It is still a very good thing to get out and get lost without any form of GPS. I think we all can imagine why it may be very important someday to be able to cross respectable distances without modern electronics. Being able to read the weather might also be a good thing.

            Every day I am more convinced that social media is among the worst things to ever happen to civilization.

            My next-door neighbor suddenly converted. He‚Äôs an old, ill alkie who sits on his porch every morning, says hello to everyone and has treats for the dogs. Used to be a cage-fighter. Race realist. Until two weeks ago we sat and talked and laughed at the folly. I always kept the recommended distance out of respect for his comorbidities.One morning I popped over to say hi. He was sitting back by the house, not out toward the street like usual. He pulled a bandana up over his face and started when he saw me.‚ÄùThe virus is getting worse!‚Äù Panic on his face. Then, the worst thing your formerly-friendly neighbor could ever say: ‚ÄúYou stay on your property and I‚Äôll stay on mine.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs sad.

        To me the modelers and public health officials were worse than the midwit hysterics in the media and public. I don‚Äôt think the former exaggerated their claims simply to be heard above the regular media din; I think they exaggerated because public health is no longer a legitimate science-based institution but one based on ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù superstition, no better than the witch tribunals of Salem.On this very website there were plenty of comments along the lines of ‚ÄúOh yeah, who am I going to listen to: a bunch of cranks on a website, or smart principled people at the CDC?‚Äù A lot of dissidents who took the Wu-flu seriously fell for the outdated notion that the CDC, WHO, university public health figures, and other overcredentialed sociologists were honest, sober scientists, when they should have understood from the get-go that all these institutions have been corrupted into irrelevance and illegitimacy by affirmative action, sociology and the social sciences.When the country‚Äôs top public health figures say it‚Äôs OK to take a break from lockdown to riot because ‚Äúracism‚Äù is supposedly an even more dangerous ‚Äúdisease‚Äù or ‚Äúpublic health crisis,‚Äù that should wake you up to how much the CDC, universities and others actually know about epidemiology. When ‚Äútrained‚Äù contact tracers are explicitly told to ignore whether infected people went to any ‚Äúprotests,‚Äù that should tell you how seriously the whole pandemic should be taken. When medical professionals sign off on back-to-back reports that celebrate tranny die-ins in Brooklyn one hour and ‚Äúdangerous disease-spreading crowds‚Äù at Trump rallies an hour later, that says a lot about said ‚Äúprofessionals.‚ÄùRealepidemiology isn‚Äôt corrupted by sociological fads like ‚Äúracism‚Äù and lockdown-exempt ‚Äúprotesting.‚Äù Any dissidents who still buy into the legitimacy of public health organizations‚Äîand there are still a lot who refuse to admit they were duped, include commenters on this site‚Äîhave some serious introspection to do. These dissidents are rightly skeptical of all official claims and narratives, but they were willing to make a one-time exception for the Wu-flu. Why? Because China went nuts? Well, why should we consider China to be some kind of bastion of sobermindedness either? The first-person accounts from China suggest that they merely went through the same kind of heavyhanded bureaucratic flexing that we did:https://kunstler.com/other-stuff/speeches-guest-articles/guest-post-lockdown-an-american-in-china-caught-in-the-corona-virus-emergency-by-evan-villarrubia/

            To have been careful, until the dimensions of the sickness became somewhat clear, was prudence.  To have blindly  followed the arbitrary directions of any of these so-called ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù would have been foolish.  None of them have had our personal best interests at heart, no matter how they posture themselves as arbiters of the public‚Äôs well-being.  They answer to a different authority, and it ain‚Äôt us.

            I hate to reduce it to this because there are other factors playing a role but, once again, it‚Äôs the women.  Any field of endeavor that gets beyond a certain percentage of women seems to slide into the darkness of unreason and unscientific thinking.  Almost all the ‚Äúpublic health professionals‚Äù I see in the mass media are female.I think the chief problem isn‚Äôt that women are worse at math and science than men (though they are) but that men and women choose careers for different reasons.Q: Why did you choose to go into epidemiology?Man: Well, I‚Äôve always been really good at math and had an interest in biology, also it seems like it pays well and has good job stability.  I thought about Computer Science but those guys keep getting replaced by Indians.Woman: I though it was a good way to SAVE THE WORLD!! Also I read that people of color get more infectious diseases and I wanted to help END SYSTEMIC RAYSISM!!! REEEEEEEEE!!!A few of these ditzes in a profession and you can laugh at them, eventually, past a certain threshold, the shrieking harpies drown everyone else out and drive everyone else out.

            This is precisely on point. The crap the colleges have been turning out the past two decades is now running these agencies. All of the non-sciences, ‚Äòsoft‚Äô sciences and administrative bodies are now fully campus-compliant in their underlying assumptions, treatment of the truth, and evaluation of problems. The hard sciences aren‚Äôt far behind, maybe another decade tops and then useful western-civ type stuff quits being invented and then quits working.Don‚Äôt know why this suddenly went Italic on me‚Ä¶At any rate, also ask yourself who goes to work for the CDC, NIH, etc: true believers already.

            8 years ago, or so, the CDC recommended that women in their childbearing years between puberty and menopause should not drink any alcohol at all if they plan on having a baby at anytime during those childbearing years. This was my red pill on recommendations from outfits like the CDC.  They are completely full of shit.

                I suspect this was actually just someone‚Äôs idea of clever anti-natalist propaganda.  The idea I suppose was to get women to pick booze over babies and maybe abort more of them because after all ‚ÄúI had a beer three years ago‚Äù.
One positive aspect of the collapse of the US government, if it happens, is the defunding of all these agencies as well as the destruction of the university system that churns out the robots who staff them.

        I have been amazed at how easy it is to see the propaganda being tossed out as truth on the media each day. The Wife watched a lot of it and reported that they were saying almost the same thing on every channel each morning. Almost at the same time even.I have followed news on viruses and vaccines since the debacle of 1976 where they nearly killed my father-in-law and his best friend. Turns out getting real information on vaccines is hard.It is difficult to get down to the studies and methods of approving the vaccine and discover that the ‚Äústudies‚Äù showing ‚Äúsafety and effectiveness‚Äù are mostly bullshit.Just the fact that we have not been able to create a vaccine for a corona, and we have really tried, and that most Americans don‚Äôt know that shows the level of stupidity and/or ignorance on the subject.They were working on a vaccine and everything looked good. They were using ferrets and the vaccine looked like a go:Then something terrible happened. Those ferrets were then exposed to the wild virus, and they all died. [They developed] inflammation in all their organs, their lungs stopped functioning and they died.Then those scientists remembered that the same thing had happened in the 1960s when they tried to develop an RSV vaccine, which is an upper respiratory illness very similar to coronavirus.Few Americans have the time or focus to read everything they can on viruses and vaccines. The wife says I am obsessed. Maybe. But you almost have to research yourself to get any truth.

                @ Compsci ‚ÄìA fearful population will make wrong decisions which they wouldn‚Äôt make under ‚Äúnormal‚Äù circumstances.A stupid population will make wrong decisions no matter what the circumstances.At present, the majority of our respective populations simply can‚Äôt rationalize the behavior or comprehend the twisted logic of those we are witnessing who are committing these riots and promoting criminal activity.Add to that the fact the police have been ordered to step back and are no longer enforcing the law, it‚Äôs a whole new level of fear and confusion.Since humans naturally fear what we don‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs a scary place for us all.

                    Thanks.  I guess the rub here between us is that you seem to think that the population‚Äôs fear is transitory or dependent on situation.  And that in some cases decision making may be done without being based upon fear.
I see the fear as being a constant, albeit situationally specific as the latest boogie man is brought up.  But none the less, whenever we seem to have great societal movements/changes these days, it seems always based upon fear.

                        The media has a long history of promoting false or misleading information (propaganda if you will) in order to instill fear in the public. And when the government makes stupid, knee-jerk decisions based on that information, that just stokes fear even more.Unfortunately, when you push fake news on a stupid population who believes the media and every blogger with a YouTube or Twitter account, that fear is going to be multiplied exponentially.Just look at your education system over the past 20-years. They no longer teach kids to think anymore, they only teach them to feel. Which is why we have a generation that are incapable of rational, logical thought.I‚Äôm not knocking the American education system. To be honest,it‚Äôs not much better over here either.

                            Interesting side note; in the 1924 bookMy Struggle, specifically the chapter on Propaganda, our old Austrian Chancellor commented that during WW1, the Americans and the British were masters of propaganda. He even went as far to admit the German attempts were actually counter productive. So give yourself credit where it‚Äôs due. The English speaking people have a long history of fake news.

                                    Is it possible to put a mark on the calendar for when Progressives actually got their start in America? Or was it just something that‚Äôs always been part of the American psyche?
Since most immigrants were rejects or failures in their home countries (immigrating Germans were certainly no exception) many of these people had already learned to hate and distrust their monarchical governments.

                                        Just a guess, 1880s or 90s?
Not a scholar on the subject, just my experience. There‚Äôs always been a utopian strain of American thought, but early on it was spiritual rather than scientific.  I‚Äôve never read anything about big government and a scientific approach that was written before the late 19th.

            Same here in AZ.  The stat‚Äôs are being cooked.  Hospitals basically being accused of fraud to collect Covid-19 treatment bonus.  What is still going down, because it‚Äôs much more difficult to mung, are death rates.  However, that figure can‚Äôt be known well for a few weeks as folks who eventually die do so much later in the disease treatment.  But the turnover in ICU‚Äîas in getting better and released‚Äîis looking good.

        ‚ÄúIf America was run by a dictator or even a junta‚Ä¶‚ÄùPretty much everyone on our side is down on democracy these days, and for good reason. In the past, even if the government were inept, we could say that at least the system preserved our freedom. Not so anymore. Say anything the regime doesn‚Äôt like, anything that contradicts their religion (even if you have evidence), and they‚Äôll ban your social media accounts. They may even close your bank account or fire you.Movies, television shows, books ‚Ä¶ all being disappeared at breakneck speed. They‚Äôre even banning episodes of Golden Girls now. What‚Äôs next? Check social media and cable news: it‚Äôs wall-to-wall government (leftist) propaganda and racial agitation. That‚Äôs by design.* Endless lies and omissions of fact. The end result of all this voting? We got a dictatorship anyway ‚Äî a bad one that‚Äôs just as dumb as the democracy we left behind ‚Ä¶ and perhaps in the near future even more oppressive because it‚Äôs animated by religious zeal as opposed to simple greed.*I mean that literally. Take Reddit for example. They‚Äôve banned Donald Trump‚Äôs fan sub along with a liberal one that mocked the police state‚Äôs obsession with war and Russia. The primary source of information now is the neoliberal r/politics. It‚Äôs nothing but Russian conspiracy theories and attacking republicans. Reddit has rigged this sub to be left-wing through disallowing many conservative posting links, except to milquetoast outlets to give the false appearance of neutrality; all their approved posting sites are mainstream, government-approved, leftist websites like Salon ‚ÄúHallmark Channel is Fascist‚Äù and MSNBC ‚Äúmuh Russia‚Äù** ‚Ä¶ and even some left-wing activist sites. A huge number of credible anti-war and conservative sites are disallowed. Like you said, ‚Äúif this were a dictatorship ‚Ä¶‚Äù Hmm. Funny that.**Seriously, what‚Äôs the left‚Äôs obsession with Russia? At first I thought it was purely racial (they are White after all). But now I‚Äôm starting to see some bizarre coincidences. Trump wants to withdraw from Afghanistan just as the majority of the public does and ‚Äî suddenly ‚Äî RUSSIA! Same with Syria. Hmm. ‚Ä¶ Afghanistan is where poppy (heroin) is grown and, I‚Äôll bet, the Syria region is where some of it is smuggled into Europe. No, never mind. Total coenkydink.‚Äú[if this were a dictatorship] the first step in fighting the disease would be controlling the flow of information‚ÄùSame with the teaching of history in public schools. If the federal government had written the textbooks instead of letting pozzed corporations write propaganda in secret and shoveling it into schools, we wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation; the public would have been in a position to see what was being taught and fight to change it back when it would have made a difference. For decades these schools have taught racism and self-hate because the left was able to steadily take over universities and school districts in secret. They started teaching (or stopped teaching) things which the public was largely unaware of. Now the hate emanating from these universities has reached a crescendo. We are watching the end of the republic before our very eyes, and it happened in our schools under our noses.Of course, any suggestion back in the day that the federal government should craft text books nationally in an open and transparent process accessible to the public would have been met with howls from screaming culture warriors:that‚Äôs socialism!Or whatever other slogan National Review or Reason came up with.Doesn‚Äôt it make more sense to monopolize the government (centers of power) and use it as a tool to mold the public in our vision rather than let a determined enemy take it and do the same for themselves? Isn‚Äôt that what the left did? They‚Äôve brainwashed normies into accepting a dictatorship of ineptitude and racial hate. If dictatorship is the inevitable end of any democracy, especially multicultural ones, wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have that dictatorship be ours instead of theirs?This is one of the many failings of American conservatism. They promoted a cult ideology which told them to surrender the battlefield to a determined enemy not willing to play by the rules. Freedom of choice? They don‚Äôt agree with it, and they will work to take your freedoms away from you if you let them. I‚Äôm completely okay with the idea of depriving my enemy of the freedom to take my freedom from me.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt like it? Go somewhere else or build your own multi-billion dollar internet company with seed money I‚Äôm sure Goldman Sachs will just hand over to you because they most assuredly treat all opinions the same. The market will work itself out.‚Äù That logic doesn‚Äôt work when one side is allowed to organize and is determined to see their moral enemies punished for heresy while the other side is atomized and blinded into not fighting back. End result: conservatives lost; freedom lost. What you‚Äôre seeing on television is just the least of what‚Äôs to come.The left will destroy every statue of White men. Mount Rushmore will come down and so will the Washington Monument. Don‚Äôt believe the false promises of Joe Biden. He‚Äôs old and won‚Äôt be around forever; the left-wing media has made if clear they have to go .. and they will as soon as they have the power to make it happen. Just yesterday the NYT was slamming the place; the Democrat party tweeted much to the same effect from their official account. AOC is the future of this party and this empire, not Joe Biden. Dark times ahead. I‚Äôll spare you the details. It‚Äôs bad, as I‚Äôm sure you can imagine.America is lost, but in the future ‚Äî when we get our own Zion ‚Äî we should make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again. No more obsession with ideologies and slogans that tell us to eschew seeking power for the sake of our tribe. There will always be someone in charge ‚Äî a ruler and those who are ruled. Why shouldn‚Äôt that ruler be ourselves?

            Part of the obsession with Russia is that they‚Äôve gone their own way outside the GlobHom system and done pretty well.
Since GlobHom is a religious movement, this makes Russia a nation of heretics.
Since GlobHom is a militant faith, the only possible solution is holy war to exterminate the unbelievers, similar to the Islamic concept of jihad.

                The other thing about Russians is that they are good at doubling-down instead of backing down, most of the time.  The attitude makes for some crazy Russian driving YouTubes, but it is a good attitude for maintaining their cultural survival in these crazy times.

        When I was a young JO in DC I learned the art of ‚Äúparalysis by analysis.‚Äù  Get a committee of self-identified experts together, bring in reams of data and an array of high-IQ / low-sense people to study it, model it, and forecast it.  Only ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù matter ‚Ä¶ do NOT bring up common sense, history, experience or anecdotal evidence.  Right results are guaranteed because the ‚Äústudy‚Äù starts with a predetermined end-result ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs usually spelled out in the preamble to the ‚Äúproblem statement,‚Äù or shared verbally by the middling-IQ suits who commissioned the ‚Äústudy.‚Äù  Then the sociopathic muckety-mucks get together and figure out the ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù and ‚Äúoptics.‚Äù  Much as I disdain the process and the people, it‚Äôs a very elegant process ‚Ä¶ and if the purpose is to persuade and move 80% of the population, it‚Äôs highly effective.

            I can see the idea of picking one‚Äôs battles, and not wasting one‚Äôs energy on fighting every-last-thing, but at some point I suppose one has to dig ones heels in, like a mule, and just generally say ‚Äúnot only ‚Äòno‚Äô, but ‚Äòhell no‚Äô‚Äù to everything.

        If this thing actually had a 2-5% IFR as originally feared, it would be a pretty big deal and understandable why some policy makers reacted the  way they did, but the general sentiment did a 180 when the IFR was revised to as low at .3-,5%, due to increased testing. In mid-April the IFR was dramatically slashed, coinciding with the bottom of the stock market. That is only about 5x as bad as the flu instead of 50-100x as originally estimated. The more testing that is done, the closer this resembles the flu in terms of mortality. It was increased testing that saved the day instead of social distancing, which has been a failure in the US although for some reason worked in China and Japan.

            ‚ÄúIn our smug arrogance‚Äù Guy at bar the other night called Huey Lewis smug. I said actually he‚Äôs a really nice guy. He goes, ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm just kidding.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt. Why would you kid about someone being smug? He probably thinks smug means a person who‚Äôs happy and smiles a lot. But what obviously separates smug from merely happy is ‚Äúsmug‚Äù gives a vibe of self-satisfied SUPERIORITY. Some definitions say it includes being ‚Äúexcessively self-satisfied‚Äù. But that could be a very happy &amp; contented person. That last definition calls on the accuser to make a value judgement. Was bar guy saying that Huey Lewis doesn‚Äôt deserve to be so happy? Besides any of that, Lewis happens to be the most humble and simpatico guy around. Never let anyone call Huey smug.

                    Sailer dropped that subject, but he‚Äôs still on about hair, and cultural appropriation, and mocking others‚Äô hypocrisy.  His usual posters are still riding their various ethnic/sexual hobby horses.  The other day he claimed that if people had listened to him in the beginning we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess.

                                Being immunocompromised can cut both ways. My wife has MS and has been on Tysbari for it (treatment suspended for now). In year 6, her risk of getting PML (a brain infection) by way of the JCV virus is 1 in 1,000.To put it in covid-19 terms, PML is kind of like if 330,000 Americans got the covid this month and all of them eventually developed the worst symptoms and half of them were dead by the end of the year.And no one ever recovered.Compared to that risk, covid and the associated mask vs. not mask debates is small potatoes. Not just small potatoes, but like nano-potatoes that can only be viewed using some sort of electron potato microscope.And yes, I do take my wife out. Sparingly, and they are short outings. But if she can sit in a mask-optional coffee shop for a half-hour with no mask and not end up in the hospital, I think us more able-bodied people can do that and then some instead of walking around all the time in public with flags of surrender over our faces.(Which is what they seem to be going for here in Pa. with that new order.)

                        Sailer is great at what he does, which is gently bring Normies closer to our side. The problem is that he leaves them about halfway across the great divide. Some finish the journey, some don‚Äôt.
Also, his Citizenism is just Civic Nationalism with a bit of HBD thrown in. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a trap for many Normies who end their journey at that point because it means they don‚Äôt have to face certain realities.

                                If you can‚Äôt figure out how Z is different from Sailer, you‚Äôre pretty hopeless.
Sailer wants to debate our way out of this. Z advocates for building communities. Granted, Z doesn‚Äôt have some grand plan, but that‚Äôs not what we need now anyway. First, we need people to start meeting IRL, forming small, trusted groups. From there, we can move slowly forward. Z also recommends attending meetings such as AmRen and supporting groups that support us. Sailer doesn‚Äôt advocate any of that.

                        Sailer opposed mass immigration before most of you were even posting about the subject. The citizen thing was only a means to make acceptable levels of diversity work. It‚Äôs fashionable to bash the guy here, but none of you (including the site proprietor) have had remotely the same quality insights he has had for as long as he has had them.

                Hmpffffff. I only have a passing familiarity with some of those men, so I ask this in all candor ‚Äì not trying to be a dink: are they numerically literate?That is so weird.

                                At the outset certain people will claim it‚Äôs just the flu and tell other posters to punch people in public who wear face masks. Without evidence, it will be compared to the Swine Flu. Then after the death toll goes down before the inevitable second wave, they‚Äôll claim it was overblown. They‚Äôll also claim it‚Äôs all a conspiracy and berate their opponents who supposedly ruined the economy with lockdowns they never really advocated or had any power over.

                            Not really. Seasonal flu ranges between a predictable yearly value of 12k ‚Äì 40k deaths with an occasional outlying year. Covid-19 is worse than that, so Sailer wasn‚Äôt wrong. He‚Äôs only backed off because deaths have predictably gone down (but still steadily mounting and much more than the average flu for this time of year). That‚Äôs not evidence that you were right. You weren‚Äôt.There will be a second wave this fall. The ultimate number of deaths will exceed 1 million, maybe 2. That‚Äôs much worse than any flu since 1918. Truthfully, he was right to post about it, and ‚Äî aside from the envious sniping here at this website ‚Äî he was mostly right. Many of the comments here (including the article you‚Äôre posting on) betray a lack of understanding of the subject. That more than anything is what is keeping normies from your side.

                                Uh, he wasn‚Äôt just posting about it, he was obsessed with it.  Oh, and how many more billions of people are on the planet compared to the last three big breakouts?  1918 (4x), 1957 (2.5x), 1968 (2x+),  so 1-2 million deaths worldwide today, would indicate the kung fru is much less dangerous than any of those previous iterations.  Curiously, I don‚Äôt recall the worldwide economy being deliberately shut down in any of those instances.

                                In terms of deaths per capita, the Beer Flu is not as bad as the Asian Flu of 1957/58. And yet, America of 1957/8 did not see fit to self-immolate. Something very essential has changed dramatically. And it damned sure hasn‚Äôt changed for the better.

                        Maybe the first week or so.What tipped me off was the runout in stats. In Italy everyone was dying from it, and in Sweden nobody was. Then the ham-handed lockdowns and precautions came out to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù ‚Äì and I knew these people had NO idea what they were doing. Then the hysterics and loons captured the media spotlight and I knew the whole thing was a human flea circus. It went from the ridiculous to the sublime ‚Äì none of the conservatives were getting it. We didn‚Äôt know anyone else that got it. But the shitlibs all had it, they all lost friends and family to it, but they bravely soldiered on and made stirring OyTube speeches and the heroic nurses danced on TIk Tok.Like most sequels, this one is promising to be an even bigger disappointment than the original act was.

                            ‚ÄúIn Italy everyone was dying from it, and in Sweden nobody was.‚Äù
That‚Äôs not true. 1) Sweden‚Äôs death toll has been in line with what you would expect 2) Italy was seeded first and more than Sweden, so this is an apples-to-oranges comparison.
‚ÄúThen the ham-handed lockdowns and precautions came out to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù ‚Äì and I knew these people had NO idea what they were doing.‚Äù
I agree with that part. Democracy is rule by mob, the lowest common denominator.

                        We can be more than fair to Sailer without cutting much slack. Sure, nobody could really tell how bad it was going to be at first.

Do you honestly think Sailer and Cochran are numerically illiterate?
This is the most arrogant and ignotant comment I‚Äôve ever seen on this site.
I think you are a fool.
I disagree with them but I acknowledge that they are: 1) heavyweights; and, 2) courageous; and, 3) waaaaay smarter than me.

        Z Man said: ‚ÄúIn reality, the more people participating in politics, the faster dumb ideas are created and allowed to zoom around the system. We‚Äôve reached a point where our society is no longer able to perform the basics.‚ÄùThat nail has been driven home twice. Right in the middle of the Kung Flu debacle we have the managerial state hiring terrorists to burn down our cities. Our masters seem completely uninterested in performing the basic function of government, which is to protect its citizens. We‚Äôve obviously reached a tipping point, where the sum total of all the bad decisions made over the past 100 years will finally shift the system from viable to non viable. You can argue forever about all the details of how and why civilisations rise and fall. But the fact is, we are seeing in real time America transition from being the most powerful, wealthy and Thoroughly competent empire in history to a complete laughing stock. The damage is done.There‚Äôs no going back. It‚Äôs all down hill from here.‚Äú‚Ä¶the Faustian civilization one day will lie in fragments, forgotten our railways and steamships as dead as the Roman roads and the Chinese wall, our giant cities and skyscrapers in ruins like old Memphis and Babylon. The history of this technics is fast drawing to its inevitable close. It will be eaten up from within, like the grand forms of any and every Culture. When, and in what fashion, we know not. Faced as we are with this destiny, there is only one world outlook that is worthy of us, that which has already been mentioned as the Choice of Achilles: better a short life, full of deeds and glory, than a long life without content. Already the danger is so great, for every individual, every class, every people, that to cherish any illusion whatever is deplorable. Time does not suffer itself to be halted; there is no question of prudent retreat or wise renunciation. Only dreamers believe that there is a way out. Optimism is cowardice. We are born into this time and must bravely follow the path to the destined end. There is no other way. Our duty is to hold on to the lost position, without hope, without rescue, like that Roman soldier whose bones were found in front of a door in Pompeii, who, during the eruption of Vesuvius, died at his post because they forgot to relieve him. That is greatness. That is what it means to be a thoroughbred. The honourable end is the one thing that can not be taken from a man.‚Äù~Oswald Spengler, Man and Technics, 1931

The effort to gin up a phony second wave panic to help Joe Biden in the election will probably be met with a second wave of hostility, much bigger than the first. The ruling class spent what was left of its legitimacy on this virus panic.‚ÄùNo matter the many shortcomings of Trump, he has made the Ruling Class openly and viciously hostile to the masses. If there were to be a foreign attack on the United States now, people gladly would signal bombers toward their D.C. and Manhattan targets. So, of course, the Ruling Class will become ever more oppressive until the benefits of violent revolt outweigh the benefits of remaining quiet. I expect to live in an oppressive police state, but would not be surprised to see China, the military, or opposition Ruling Class mercenaries topple the Empire‚Äôs rulers.The passive reaction to the initial lock downs and the anti-White riots have emboldened the Ruling Class. It will make them reckless now.

        The virus isn‚Äôt about the virus. It‚Äôs about control. It‚Äôs easy to forget that the rest of the world is still locked down too. The Davos crowd and their enormous NGO,UN, and WHO gang have shut down the whole world . The local politicians of the uniparty now rule with absolute impunity. They will never let go of this . thats why the masks are so important to them , it keeps normie from thinking ‚Äù hey, why are they still doing this stuff?&#x27;‚Äù when it‚Äôs clear the virus is weakening , and the death rate is falling like a rock.their enforcers are out there too.https://www.takimag.com/article/antifas-a-laugh-riot-until-it-comes-for-you/

        I saw a ghetto-car (big rims &amp; lots of chrome) fly by at an intersection and obviously exceeding the speed limit.  I immediately thot, ‚Äúif a cop saw that, he‚Äôd probably not even give chase ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too much trouble to deal with a Black guy.‚Äù.   That‚Äôs an indication as to how much the Blacks have won.

                    I always found it funny pointing out how the guardian is financed out of a closed off tax free management company in the Cayman Islands (of which the editor Rushbrigger is a director) and how they failed to pay 1 penny of tax when the sold AutoTrader for 300million.
It is amusing to hear the defensive pretzels of those same readers clamouring for a soak the rich platform.

        Who panicked first, the Chicoms right? They locked down a city of 10 million. Then the panic spread around the world. But why did the CCP panic? They are supposedly the technocratic creme de la creme. That is to say, their top leadership is.Something doesn‚Äôt add up here, unless they thought they were facing an unknown of frightening proportions. With their forced quarantines, massive disinfection campaigns, etc., they were sending the message that something terrible was about to happen. But why? It only makes sense if they knew it was a man-made virus that had escaped from that lab. This will never be admitted.

            My working hypothesis is this:
Yes, there was a deadly, world-ending, man-made gain-of-functioned virus that escaped from a lab in Wuhan at some point.
However, as well all know, Mother Nature bats last. She is also a jealous deity that reserves the privilege of creating extinction-level plagues unto herself.
Thus, Nature called bullshit and stepped in at some point just after the Wuhan lockdown to evolve the virus into, ‚Äújust the flu, bro.‚Äù
Our satanic governments and media are unable to accept and admit Nature‚Äôs intervention, so they continue to pretend that Beer flu is an extinction-level event.

                    We assume that our COVID response was a dry run for the inevitable police state, so why should we assume the ChiComs did it for reasons of ‚Äúpublic health‚Äù?

                        My alternate hypothesis is that the CCP, DNC, Soros, et al realized that impeachment wasn‚Äôt going to work so they decided to roll out the pandemic to see what happened.
If the pandemic failed to take there would be some minor stories about how the Wuhan lab had a leak but it was cleaned up and under control.
I struggle to believe that they understood the mood in the West so well that they knew their effort would be a wild success.

It wouldn‚Äôt have to be. While there may be overlap in the parts of its genome responsible for human transmissibility and lethality, there is no reason to assume so. Development could proceed along separate paths for each portion, to be spliced together later as needed.

        ZMan‚Äôs analysis of the covid-19 phenomenon is fine ‚Äì as far as it goes. He, however, either does not want to go all the way, or cannot. Therefore, someone else will have to say it: Covid-19 is a manufactured crisis, of the kind which is a classic found in the deep-state repertiore, its black bag of tricks.The inner party ‚Äì which is a neat turn of phrase by the way ‚Äì uses manufactured crises under a number of conditions, many of which pertain here.First, a false-flag attack (a form of manufactured crisis) is often used when the deep-state wants the attention of the public diverted from something it would rather they did not study too closely. The ongoing denouement of the Epstein sex-abuse scandal being an example. Hundreds of powerful people, real players in Washington and other power centers, are caught up in the scandal. Even Prince Andrew of the British royal family, is rumored to be amongst the names ‚Äì perhaps even Donald Trump himself.How anxious is the inner party to keep this scandal contained? Anxious enough to risk going to war to cover it up. Try that one on for size. The deep-state is willing to risk war with China (and possibly Russia, too), in the name of preventing criminal indictments from being handed down.Another method using manufactured crisis is when the ruling class elites want to do something, want to advance an agenda or get something done, but do not have a logical, defensible pretext for doing it. Rolling out further abridgments of civil rights in America is probably a difficult task under status normal conditions, but in the name of a nebulously-defined ‚Äúpublic safety‚Äù and ‚Äúpublic health,‚Äù people will surrender all sorts of rights they would normally guard fiercely. Enter covid-19‚Ä¶.Next comes the move ‚Äì which the globalists have long-wanted ‚Äì to an all-digital currency, no physical currency or coins anymore. They want it for reasons of control, power, greed and data-mining, but since those aren‚Äôt ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù reasons, they‚Äôll push the idea that coins and currency are ‚Äúvectors‚Äù of covid-19. While it is true that many objects can be fomites (physical vectors) for pathogens, including money ‚Äì that fact didn‚Äôt end physical currency in one of history‚Äôs most-lethal pandemics, the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918-1919. So why is covid-19 being used to end it now? Answer: Because the big-shots want something done, and they need a manufactured crisis to do it.Bill and Melinda Gates and their globalist pals will also try and ride covid-19 long-enough to enact mandatory vaccinations, which won‚Äôt just be against the virus. The concoctions will also contain nanotechnology taggants which will digitally-label anyone so treated. At one fell-swoop, making humans into commodities not unlike livestock in a pen, which just so happens to closely-subscribe to how Gates sees ordinary people.Last and perhaps the piece de resistance, the two-pronged covid-19 and the BLM/Antifa events, may just topple the U.S. into the ‚Äúcolor revolution‚Äù the elites have been seeking in the U.S., again with the intent of pursuing their dreams of one-world government and globalism.In short, covid-19 is a weapon, one whose effects are every bit as deadly as any gun aimed at someone‚Äôs head. Manufactured crisis is a weapon, too, especially the way that the deep-state uses it.

        Realize that the dominance of sociopaths in our society could only happen to us because we value words, reason, laws, education.

And the reason why nigger supremacy has happened is the niggers act.  No matter how retarded the nigger is dominant because the nigger is violent.

This is just the eternal story of man.

As for the nigger being the puppet of Jews, women, bankers etc‚Ä¶ no.
Once they knelt to whom they knelt is in charge.

You can act or you can talk, one of these lives has a future and the other does not.

        Security guards employed to keep the hotels safe where returnees were being quarantined were actually rutting the guests! Of course, the security guards were of the corrupt, third-world variety where chain corporations awarded the contracts to the cheapest bidder who then sub-contracted the work out to unqualified, barely English speaking dregs who took advantage of the guests! Oh yeah, they are doing the jobs we don‚Äôt want to do though‚Ä¶.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=12344915

        Went to IHOP the other day for breakfast.  Kentucky requires masks for employees, but not customers.  Fair enough, and frankly, I like the idea of the minimum wage slaves at restaurants who handle my food having to wear masks even after Covid isn‚Äôt a thing.
Except‚Ä¶
I observed our waitress coming with our food.  Her hands were full and her mask needed adjusting, so another waitress reached up and adjusted her mask for her.
It‚Äôs all just theater at this point.

        In defense of the alarmists, very early on they had no way of knowing exactly what they were dealing with. The Chinese had covered up and only reluctantly admitted that a pandemic started. If you look up SARS, you will see it was extremely contagious with a case fatality rate of over 10%. Not officially admitted but decision makers would have assumed SARS-CoV-2 was an escaped lab experiment, genetically engineered for increased infection and other unknown functions. They had every reason to fear massive contagion and high death rate. Fortunately the latter was not an outcome.

                    Wake up, in december last year China notified the world health organization about a pneumonia type virus, every country was told about it, including USA.China eliminated Covid clinical trials cause there simply weren‚Äôt that many people getting sick with it, not cause they were covering it up, most people here on this site agree Covid is bullshit anyway.The difference between chinese &amp; westerners is that chinese are not incompetent, they wanted to make sure people who died were actual victims of Corona &amp; not some other disease, this takes time to find out. They are not the types who shout ‚ÄúCorona! Corona! Let‚Äôs panic!‚Äù like the Karens &amp; soybois of western world do.Also, trusting western media? Really? Really?

Corona √Æs a bullshit virus, there really √Æs no good reason why they would cover it up.How gullible can u be to think escaped bats from evil chineze lab created an epidemic that would change the world.This √Æs Iron Man vs Mandarin marvel comics type stuff, same thing with Putin The Rasputin who controls Tsar Trump like a puppetmaster.Also, chinese are na»õionalistic, this makes them more honest than globalists who depend on lies to exist. This is an universal truth, na»õionalists are simply more honest.

Communism is everywhere and always has been since its inception a puppet mind control device for other forces.

There aren‚Äôt any because there weren‚Äôt any that were worth developing a vaccine for. They started work on one for SARS but since SARS is only infectious when the patients require hospitalization it was easy to contain and burned out; the effort was abandoned.
There are numerous corona virus vaccines for animals.

            Only thats not quite true is it?From: a 2019 NIH study on PEDV vaccines:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6329175/As it points out there are significant problems including the vaccine causing actual infections:‚ÄúHowever, concerns remain because the attenuated PEDV strains may revert to virulence via mutation in the natural hosts or generate new virulent strains by exchanging their genes with field strains via recombination.‚ÄùIt goes on:‚ÄúConsidering the fact that feedback method using highly virulent PEDV viruses may facilitate the spread of other infectious agents in the herds and PEDV persistence on farms, and inactivated/subunit PEDV vaccine is mainly effective in previously PEDV-exposed but not PEDV-naive sows, a safe and efficacious live attenuated PEDV vaccine is still urgently needed.‚ÄùIt concludes:Our results demonstrated the difficulty in obtaining fully attenuated PEDV that retains its immunogenicity using traditional cell culture adaptation approaches.

        Most people, and this includes me, have no business being involved in politics and policy anyway. We arent smart enough, informed enough, or educated enough generally. A benevolent ruling class has no reason to even let us see how the sausage is made. It just seems to cause division and anxiety, everyone fretting over things they cant change anyway and of course causes an inflated sense of importance or even grandiosity which is really apparent in places like Facebook.
I know i am just restating what you said, so the point is: good post.
