        After Minneapolis burned, I wonder what its going to take for a ‚Äúrooftop Korean‚Äù zeitgeist to assert itself?
A Trump re-election, coupled with a mistrial of Derek Chauvin, (both functions of highly refined and understood legal mechanisms) would literally set the country ablaze.
Half the country stupidly would cheer it on, and local governments would do nothing.  If that doesn‚Äôt spur individuals to organize for defense, nothing will.

            Almost feels as though that is exactly what Ellison has served up by overcharging Chauvin.  Once the toxicology and autopsy results are shown in open court it will be difficult to prove the 1st degree murder charge‚Äîif it is an option in MN to convict on a lesser charge‚Äîsay negligent homicide‚Äîthat or an acquittal will set off a full chimp out.  The expectation is for a life sentence anything less‚Ä¶

                Which brings up a question I‚Äôve been pondering for some time now. Why on earth would Chauvin (or any white man in his situation) just sit still and wait to be thrown into a rape-cage with animals for the rest of his miserable life? Why wouldn‚Äôt he use his remaining time to do some truly useful, practical things? (Not that I‚Äôm advocating violence‚Ä¶in fact, I denounce myself for even pondering such things!). Really, now‚Ä¶Chauvin KNOWS what‚Äôs coming. He knows that his freedom is GONE once the verdict comes in. So what‚Äôs the point of sitting passively and letting the system have its way with him? I ask merely in theory, naturally‚Ä¶

                    I think that the judge has imposed a gag order, so there may not be much he can say.  I assume, if Chauvin has competent counsel, there are a lot of things going on behind the scenes.  Still, given what happened to James Fields, Chauvin‚Äôs prospects do not look good.

                        It‚Äôs significant that the police‚Äôs camera footage has not been released.
I assume that the policeman‚Äôs camera footage exonerates the officer, just like the complete tape of Rodney King exonerated the officers.

                        There really is no rational way a judge can impose a gag order, while allowing ABMs to riot without restraint in the name of ‚ÄòGeorge Floyd.‚Äô  How is that not adversely impacting the fairness of any trial?
I hope AG Ellison is forced to eat his own crap.  Here‚Äôs a case that perfectly aligns with his religious background ‚Äì all a black man has to do is die and it wipes the slate clean and he becomes an instant martyr for their vaunted Utopia ‚Äì see Treyvon Martin, John Lewis, et al.

                        It is interesting. The case of the jogger in Mississippi who killed five or six people in a furniture store, was convicted, and sentenced to death. His case has had several retrials because reasons. James Fields gets nothing at all.

            I had several Scandis last year insist that Icke was really talking about Jews and talking up his stuff as crypto-antisemitism, but from what I‚Äôve seen and heard, I think he‚Äôs actually talking about lizard-people.  Never could shake that ‚Äì not my dude.

                He‚Äôs pretty new-agey. Heart‚Äôs in the right place.

I think the same about AJ sometimes. Replace ‚Äòglobalists‚Äô with ‚ÄòJews‚Äô and he might as well be quoting the Protocols üôÇ

That‚Äôs not to discredit the message, but it‚Äôs interesting that there are all these theories out there that amount to the old Jewish conspiracy theory. I wonder what‚Äôs at the bottom of that rabbit hole‚Ä¶

        November 3rdif Trump loses that will wake up some people, not the majority but we will get more who will lean our way.If Trump wins then its a slower process but still in play. Tucker showing how republicans aren‚Äôt doing anything about tech censorship is one of those steps. But Trump is both a crutch and a dam. Conservative Americans use him as a crutch not to deal with the reality of what is facing them. And he is sort of a dam holding it all back.Or maybe he is an accelerator that fires up the radical lefts emotion to do what they want to do to us anyway?Either way when Trump is gone it gets even worse in my opinion.

                Slow boil as power in the bureaucracy is strengthened and Trump roll-back under taken.  This will come within two years as they will fear reversal in House as per Obama.

                I agree with Jack here.  The left has let their violent extremists out of their boxes, they can only be loosely directed, and they don‚Äôt actually control them. If Biden wins, they will retrench and consolidate, turning the boiling down to a simmer again; Orange Man will be driven from the stage, and the crowd will cheer and get their dopamine hit from the climax of victory.OTOH, if Trump wins, the crazy, violent radicals are morally bound to keep ratcheting it up ‚Äì as Zman says, the left is in a purety spiral where evermore extreme extremism is the only path forward until the Current Year‚Äôs Enemy is beaten.  If the far left blue states drive all the normal, middle class white people into penury and make them fear for their lives every time the go to the grocery store, our ranks will swell and the cities will empty, advancing the necessary precursors of our freedom from the Damned Yankee Puritans.

            ‚ÄúEither way when Trump is gone it gets even worse in my opinion.‚ÄùYou are correct, in reality Trump has very limited executive power(the man has no political allies), but for better of for worse he represents the face of white nationalism. Even if right wingers think he is useless, not voting for him is a sign OF SPIRITUAL SUBMISSION TO NWO, that‚Äôs similar to cuckholding, selling out your only ally to the enemy is a major sin, we all know the Judas story.

                Because many still think the cavalry is coming, or that yes, Vesuvius is certainly going to blow its top‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôll definitely move out of Pompeii next year, or certainly the year after.

Use your vacation time to investigate areas for towns and jobs which will allow you a future‚Ä¶ instead of going to Vegas or Disneyworld. Put money aside, take tentative steps beyond simple planning. Begin. Please.

                We already have the very early versions of death squads with local militias and the vigilante groups active in Minneapolis and elsewhere. If such things were active we‚Äôd never  hear about it either way.if the succeed its one and done, if they fail, the PTB‚Äôs don‚Äôt want to encourage more of same.Allegedly there was discussion of such things by some ex cops on a private Facebook channel. Given it was some Lefty claiming it , its probably bosh but who knows.Ultimately though, this system is dying and cannot be sustained.ts energy cost, complexity cost and social inefficiency have created a situation in which no group who is able to sustain it has offspring. The upper classes have some kids but even the tech elite aren‚Äôt able to keep cities safe, water running or find a way to magic up enough anything to keep it up. Most lack any ‚Äòhard‚Äô skills at all.The danger is that a dying empire will result to any sort of chicanery or low behavior just to live for a while longer. The elite, any elite would consider loss of that dopamine hit from status a fate worse than hell itself. If you see them as very high functioning junkies you wouldn‚Äôt be far from the truth.This makes then quite dangerous for people who value individualism, peace and good order. Upside, only the former need go to win. Rotting the elite is a group thing. and peace and good order can be imposed y the group after all.

                    Most of it is projection, but when the Left attributes its own domestic terrorism to the Right it reveals its greatest fears. Even a medium value target taken out would be a game changer and the Left knows it. If the Left continues to oppress the White masses, death squads will be as popular as Facebook if they come into existence.

                Well, B123, ask yourself this: do combat arms soldiers meet each other for the first time when they‚Äôre forward deployed? The current ‚Äúructions‚Äù are the hard left militias training, growing, and learning, developing and refining their 4gw tactics and strategies. Their leaders and foot soldiers are getting street cred, learning their trades in a friendly environment, where getting caught means immediate free bail and no prosecution.I have no doubt that the American Pol Pot or Dzerzhinksy is earning his stripes right now, throwing a molotov at the five-oh on some street in Oakland/Portland/Washington/Chicago.

        The one difference between our reality and the conjured reality of the above scenario is the people under attack in our world lack self-awarenessYes, I believe this is mostly true. One thing about a lot of your violence in the States is that it is obvious who is on the ground and causing the damage‚Ä¶ Joggers, leftists, the usual suspects. My worry would be that people become aware of this, see their area go down the toilet and then relocate. But they never see the people pulling the strings which sets them up for the same problem over and over again ‚Äì wherever and forever. They boil for a bit, then return to that slow simmer.You can jog away from the joggers for a bit, but TPTB have a reach from which you cannot run and this is what I have found to be the most challenging part of basing people who are salvageable. They (now) see the tip of the iceberg, but not the rest of it ‚Äì but that‚Äôs by design, of course.The second biggest challenge I have come across when talking about this is that, once realized, quite a lot of people will say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care‚Äô. To them, building a community, networking and finding allies is ‚Äòuncool‚Äô, ‚Äòtoo much work‚Äô, ‚Äòwon‚Äôt make a difference‚Äô‚Ä¶ Perhaps ‚Äì but what else is there? Even starting by ditching the things that are obvious money and time sinks that feed the enemy seem too much for them.There‚Äôs work to be done‚Ä¶

            Yeah Orange, as much as we focus on the other side‚Äôs fixation on various cultish fantasies we unfortunately have many on our own side who stew in their own magic sauce as the invisible hand of the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù turns up the gas.Even the few that come to realize there are in fact sides and that there is a spiritual war of good and evil dividing our hearts, somehow return to what is comfortable.They ostrich back into their ever-shrinking sandbox of 1986 America. The only strings they allow themselves to see are those that drive up the cost of the sand. Which can be explained by taxes, spending, and ‚Äúthe liberals!‚Äù.Just the other day I had two close friends walked up to the edge of the great divide. After staring into the abyss, the abyss stared into them. What did they see? ‚ÄúThe liberals are trying to divide us by using identity politics. We must resist that so we can unify again through our common history‚Äù.These men are both way more awake than normiecons and living behind enemy lines in CA. Yet the libertarian market fetish and anti-racist blank slate still grips them.They need the consitution-free market mythology as much as the other side needs their white privilege and systemic racism. What they fail to grasp is that in this undocumented mexican standoff the tide of progress is eroding away at their 1986 outpost and when this one is gone there will be no others.

                Yet the libertarian market fetish and anti-racist blank slate still grips them.The blank slate barrier is a considerable hurdle. My ‚Äòrace realism‚Äô, for want of a better term, came from experience dealing with people of different races as well as an awful lot of reading history. When you read about the histories of different peoples, you come away thinking there must surely be group differences, there can‚Äôt not be. But how do you distill that experience and knowing into a couple of remarks to try an convince someone of this.That said, I have broken some new ground with the current BLM overreach.

            OF, the next time you get to the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù point in a conversation, see if they would be willing to just turn off Netflix, or stop shopping at Amazon.

                The problem I think is that to them, whilst they fully agree with me on the pernicious effect of these mega corporations, the shock to their system on withdrawal would be immense. On the one hand, they have Netflix with its (in their eyes) harmless programming on the other: No TV!
For most of these people, TV is everything and I think coming up with alternatives for each person and subtly guiding them that way is key. You‚Äôre right though, start small and build from there on.

Exactly. Lots of people made lots of money building refugee cam‚Äî er, suburbs, corporatizing them with big box shopping centers, brainwashing the youth with state-controlled schools, sterilizing white culture by uprooting white people.

                    The kulaks were farmers that sort of owned the land they farmed (no one owned land in Imperial Russia As we understand the word) as opposed to serf and share croppers.   The whites organized them during the civil war in an attempt to starve out the Bolsheviks in the cities.  That attempt failed badly and was followed by the bolsheviks ‚Äúcollectivizing agriculture‚Äù which was really just a return to and extension of serfdom.  And the ‚Äúliquidated‚Äù the kulaks ‚Äì a sort of genocide  perpetrated against formerly independent farmers.  It‚Äôs been debated what would have happened to them without the preceding civil war.  They may have been targeted for elimination anyway ‚Äì or maybe not.  The reality though, is that they tried to starve the cities into submission, failed and were treated in kind for losing.

                            That‚Äôs one way of looking at it.Another is that once the killing starts events take on a life of their own and the situation spins out of control.An aspect of the bolsheviks in Russia that people in the west almost universally ignore is that lots of people in Russia in the 20s wanted to kill all of them and seize control themselves ‚Äì tried to do just that ‚Äì and would have had just as much legitimacy as the bolshies had they won ‚Äì which is to say none really.  So in that environment its understandable that they were murderous.Ultimately, I‚Äôd say its a warning to those fantasizing about civil war here ‚Äì it absolutely won‚Äôt go the way they imagine and they most certainly won‚Äôt like the end result ‚Äì even if they win.

                I honestly don‚Äôt know enough. I‚Äôve readSolzhenitsyn‚Äôs ‚Äú200 years Together‚Äù and the most I can gather from the perspective of the Russian and Ukranian farmers were that things were so chaotic they never really new who was in charge or why the orders implemented that directly affected them were done in such a way. I am sure there are better histories for this particular aspect, and I am sure teh Z-man has read them and has a much greater understanding of what happened.

                        That‚Äôs the piece of the puzzle that I really wonder about: How aware were the kulaks about what was descending upon them?Because it seems that‚Äôs really the unexplored dynamic here: how much would ‚Äúknowing‚Äù that the leftie genocide vans were out on the streets ‚Äì alter the outcome?The right wing pro-gun crowd has had a phobia (if you want to call it that) about gun confiscation for as long as I‚Äôve been watching ‚Äì which is probably at least 25 years now.Thinking about that scenario critically though ‚Äì I‚Äôve felt the need to point out to these people over and over again that their fear of nationwide gun confiscation is probably VERY unrealistic.  I suppose if it‚Äôs instituted nationwide a la‚Äô Australia ‚Äì and the orders go out to just hand them in ‚Äì that‚Äôs a ‚Äúworry‚Äù that should be taken seriously.  Because if you don‚Äôt ‚Äì you will be a Fed criminal list.  But you see if you don‚Äôt comply ‚Äì and nobody else complies either ‚Äì well suddenly you don‚Äôt have as much to fear.  NOBODY has the resources to go nation-wide all at once ‚Äì and collect all the guns.What that means practically ‚Äì is that if they actually start collecting ‚Äì it will be localized. Which ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ with modern communications , means if you‚Äôre not in that area ‚Äì you should know ahead of your time in the queue.So in the end ‚Äì the real issue revolves around compliance.  If you simply don‚Äôt comply ‚Äì you , and others ‚Äì don‚Äôt have anywhere near as much to really worry about.Active resistance then starts to make the wheels of the machine get full of sand.  Solzenitzhen pointed this out:  If they had just picked up an ice pick and stabbed the secret policemen the neck ‚Äì pretty soon they would have run out  and the machine would have stopped.The gun rights crowd also gets very upset about things like gun registration.  Which strictly speaking ‚Äì they should.  But when I point out methods of resistance ‚Äì they get upset and flummoxed.  Let‚Äôs say you own 20 guns (not an obscene amount for a lot of gun owners) ‚Äì and the state you live in forces you to register them.  Well you see now they‚Äôre on a bureaucratic list.  When the order goes out to collect them ‚Äì they‚Äôll be going off that list.  If they can simply go to your house ‚Äì throw you and your family into one van to be taken to the ditches, while the next crew gathers up all the firearms and brings them to the smelting facility ‚Äì their job is relatively easy.If however ‚Äì when they go to your house and find NOTHING.  Well now they have a big problem.  You have taken what would have been maybe a job that took 2 men four hours to accomplish ‚Äì and turned into something that could possibly take many hundreds of hours ‚Äì involving dozens of people.  Where the hell are all the guns?   They‚Äôre on this list ‚Äì WE MUST FIND THEM!!.  This is the way bureaucracies work.  They won‚Äôt just shrug and ignore the issue if their orders say FIND THE GUNS.This is what the Yugoslav and French resistance did to the Germans during WW2.  Many thousands of troops tied up trying to hunt down hundreds of men.  It‚Äôs what all resistance movements that I‚Äôve ever studied do.  They force multiply by screwing with the system they‚Äôre trying to defeat.

                The kulaks were the emerging bourgeois that started appearing after the serfs were freed in 1861. The radicals and the revolutionaries had a horror of constitutionalism and capitalism and they believed it would be easier to implement socialism without a strong middle class despite the fact that that goes completely against Marxist ideology. Mostly the revolutionaries were small conspiracy among the educated Elite. They weren‚Äôt really supported by the people. It was a real ends-justify-the-means crowd.

                To the kulaks‚Äô credit, they largely were ignorant about the terror about to be unleashed on them. NormieCons are fully aware and in denial. The important thing is to change their perception and it looks like the Left has decided, impulsively, to help out.

                Before 1917, ‚ÄúKulak‚Äù existed as a term but had no real political, economic or cultural significance.
After 1917, the lizard people basically invented Kulaks as a political enemy and declared their liquidation necessary to achieve the revolution.

                Citizen, the cancel culture is lazy tyranny and I suspect you called it perfectly. I do believe there will be physical responses to being cancelled at some point.And as we build communities, and we will, defense against infiltration will also prescribe physical response.

                Citizen ‚Äì After reading your comment I got up and went over to one of our bookshelves.  I thought, perhaps, there was something from my grad school days that would suit.  But it appears almost every book was written by a small-hatted partisan source, and given the instructor was an avowed British leftist, I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised.  Perhaps Robert Conquest‚Äôs ‚ÄúHarvest of Sorrow,‚Äù about the Holodomor, would be a useful substitute.

                Not exactly what you‚Äôre looking for but a book everyone should read‚Ä¶
It is the story of the RR from the inside. About an apartment of apparatchiks who were true believers, helped run the USSR and who were all eventually purged, exiled or murdered by the Soviets.
The author is an ethnic white Russian. He‚Äôs also written an interesting book on the Jews. K.Mac has an excellent review of the Jewish book.

                At the least, everyone should read up on the endgame..And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling in terrorat every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand. The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin‚Äôs thirst; the cursed machine would have ground to a halt!‚Äù‚ÄìThe Gulag Archipelago, Aleksandr SolzhenitsynPeople should be amassing information about their local security operatives, where they live, where their wives work, where the kid goes (went? now?) to school.

            Russian Orthodox priests paradropped from German aircraft to blow up or photograph Soviet infrastructure. They had a better chance of practicing their religion under Hitler than Stalin.from Rudel, Hans Ulrich. ‚ÄúStuka Pilot.‚ÄùNow I take up the file of photographs of the factories in question and study them with interest. I see that a high percentage of them are already underground and are therefore partly unassailable from the air. The photographs show the dam and the power station and some of the factory buildings; they have been taken during the war. How can this have been done? I think back to my time in the Crimea and put two and two together. When I was stationed at Sarabus and keeping myself fit by a little putting the weight and discus throwing after operations a black-painted aircraft often used to land on the airfield, and very mysteriously passengers alighted. One day one of the crew told me under the seal of secrecy what was going on. This aircraft carried Russian priests from the freedom-loving states of the Caucasus who volunteered for important missions for the German command. With flowing beards and dressed in clerical garb each of them carried a little packet on his chest, either a camera or explosives according to the nature of his mission. These priests regarded a German victory as the only chance of regaining their independence and with it their religious liberty. They were fanatical enemies of world Bolshevism and consequently our allies. I can still see them: often men with snow white hair and noble features as if chiselled out of wood.From the deep interior of Russia they brought back all kinds of photographs, were months en route and generally returned with their mission accomplished. If one of them disappeared he presumably gave his life for the sake of freedom, either in an unlucky parachute jump or caught in the act of carrying out his purpose or on his way back through the front. It made a profound impression on my mind when my informant described to me the way these holy men unhesitatingly jumped into the night, sustained by their faith in their great mission. At that time we were fighting in the Caucasus and they were dropped in different valleys in the mountains where they had relations with whose help they proceeded to organise resistance and sabotage. It all comes back to me as I puzzle over the origin of the photographs of these industrial plants.

        Not that it‚Äôs much comfort, but today I realized that the right-to-left hopscotch court works both ways. I guess this only confirms how deeply Finkelthink has ensnared white America.What is the ‚Äúright-to-left hopscotch court‚Äù? It is the oft-remarked phenomenon in which the left constantly leaps one square ahead, prompting the right to constantly leap one square forwardright behind themto clamor insistently that that should be the last square forward.Some recent examples include the left jumping forward to declare the Betsy Ross flag racist, which prompted the right to jump forward to say ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôre crazy, this isn‚Äôt the confederate flag we‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù when the right should never have surrendered the confederate flag in the first place. Or when the left moved on from gay marriage to tranny and pedo ‚Äúrights‚Äù, such that the right is now vigorously defending gay marriage and lambasting based 1990s Biden for not supporting it. Or when the right defends Harry Potter and JK Rowling from the left who now want to ban her books, when in the early 2000s the right lambasted her books as the corrupting degeneracy they were. I could go on‚Ä¶We‚Äôve despaired at how the right always follows the left in the hopscotch court, but we haven‚Äôt paid much attention to the fact it sometimes goes in the other direction too. After Trump decided to pull troops out of Germany‚Äîand we‚Äôll see if he even follows through on that‚Äîthe left is now predictably hopping one space to the right to defend neocon imperialism on ‚ÄúRussia, Russia, Russia‚Äù grounds:https://twitter.com/NickJFuentes/status/1288878079079841793Look at the replies under Schmidt‚Äôs original post. Big props to Fuentes for noticing. There are probably lots of neocons in there, but also a lot of leftists and liberals ‚Äúoutraged, just outraged!‚Äù at Trump‚Äôs‚Äîon paper‚Äîaction. The left has unwittingly jumped right on the hopscotch court, just like when they supported continued warfare in Syria (‚ÄúMeet freedom fighter Mo[hammed]. The US wants to abandon him.‚Äù) because Trump wanted to wrap it up.Pure Finkelthink in action!

        The most likely option here is our new overlords win and we are frog marched onto cattle cars in a revenge fantasy.This is the whole point of an oppression narrative. Oppression narratives are made up or exaggerated to make violence against the ‚Äúoppressor‚Äù OK. Whether or not this was ever a conscious plan in the past is probably unknowable, but it is undeniable fact that it‚Äôs what is in their minds today. Ray Charles can see this shit coming. Even the dullest people have got to see that the hatred and resentment being ginned up against us is extremely dangerous and is already causing low-level attacks on us.

        The problem for the normie whites is that they still have too much to lose to fight back. They have jobs, family, and property. Of course, that may be changing now as the pandemic panic goes on to destroy more of the economy. But if a handful of shopkeepers or downtown residents fought back against the rioters, they would all just end up in prison on federal and state charges.  The power of the federal government is ultimately what provides the foundation for all these groups to operate with impunity. As long as there is a fed aligned with these groups, the attacks on normies will continue and only get worse.That‚Äôs why I always encourage my congresscritters to vote to spend more and more.  The sooner the fed goes completely bankrupt, the sooner our government can be replaced with something better.

        Another important difference is the math of the situation. On the alien world, the existing species have the numbers on their side. In this world, the ruling coalition does not have numerical superiority. Once the people being attacked realize there is no negotiating with the lizard people and there is no escaping the situation, the math of the situation becomes the most salient aspect of the fight. The only question is how long will it take for the people under siege to grasp the reality of their situationExcellent metaphor. Numerical superiority is somewhat ancillary to how long it takes the largest group under siege to wake up. From what we see, everything is accelerating because the subjugated have started, first at the fringes and now in the wider population, to grok what is happening to them. Those masses have to be kept in a trance, and that seems to have been prematurely abandoned to a degree. The impulsive rush to declare victory is the weakest part of the oppressors‚Äô plan.

            Whites are already a minority at least in practical terms. At a minimum 20% of our tribe will under no circumstances come round to acting on behalf of white interests in opposition to the demands of non white groups. Never. Many will actively work to undermine our interests.
If and when we come out on top we would be doing our posterity an enormous favor in sending this faction packing.

                ‚Äú‚Ä¶doing our posterity an enormous favor in sending this faction packing.‚ÄùThis. I‚Äôve got these people in my own family.There really is zero chance of negotiation or compromise. They will never stop. The moral solution is their expulsion.Even that may be cucky. When the Spanish tired (after spending 100 years trying to reintegrate them after the success of the Reconquista) of the violent dyscivilizational behavior of the Moriscos (Spanish-blood Islamics who converted during the 700-year occupation) they expelled them into North Africa. Alas, that measure of mercy was repaid by many Moriscos joining piratical slaving expeditions that preyed upon European coasts.

        For most of the history of this former country, Whites didn‚Äôt need to think or worry about the culture or the trajectory as they were the clear demographic majority and pretty much everyone just assumed it would always be this way.  There was a scare in the early 20th century and so immigration was basically shut down for forty years.  But the termites were gnawing at the foundation.  Fast forward to today and here we are ‚Äì Whites are a bare majority and numerous coalitions are agitating against us on all sides.  And still the bulk of our compatriots are doing their daily thing and acting like it‚Äôs 1955 and nothing is ever going to change.  If the riots, the shutdowns, the economic and psychological destruction, the evermore strident anti-White animus and the looming cluster f*** of an election (or maybe not) doesn‚Äôt wake the sheeple out of their torpor, god knows what will.  The hour grows short.

            It was a genius plan to change the immigration laws in 1965 and at the same time, launch anti-racist propaganda, along with pushing an agenda that America is multiracial and always has been, and is simply an idea, not a people.  Eventually all of this escalates into a generally accepted concept that discrimination and racism from whites and only whites, is about the worst thing ever, which paralyzes whites from pushing back.  That‚Äôs where we are now.  JP (I know, but he‚Äôs said some smart things) has said, ‚Äúwhen you suppress something, it comes back with a vengeance.‚Äù  We‚Äôre going to be forced to find out if that‚Äôs true.

                Could happen. Much of the right wing support base though ‚Äì if you brought up the allegation that it was a manufactured event ,  would start yelling at you about conspiracy theories.The ignorance &amp; stupidity of many right wingers just gets tiresome after a while if the truth was being told.One way of inserting doubt into the conversation that happens every time there is a mass shooting event that I‚Äôve found to be pretty effective ‚Äì and that never gets any accusations of coming from a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù ‚Äì is to just say ‚Äù well that was pretty convenient ‚Äì wasn‚Äôt it‚Äù  ‚Äì because it seems these events, at least the ones that get hammered on by the press ‚Äì always seem to come at inflexion points where they can be used for political leverage.Which ‚Äì if you‚Äôve been paying attention lately ‚Äì  you would have noticed there has been a conspicuous absence of large scale press coverage of any large scale shooter events.   I don‚Äôt really follow the news closely enough to know if there simply hasn‚Äôt been any ‚Äì or if they just don‚Äôt cover them at all.

Anyone who says we should ‚Äúdo something‚Äù should be immediately suspected as a federal agent at worst and a deluded libertarian larper at best. Yes, believe it or not, some  idiot libertarian larpersdidstep into the fake ‚Äúboogaloo‚Äù theater set up for them by the feds‚Äîas always, Z is right in arguing that libertarians deserve to be beaten and driven from our lands.Let the ricocheting golems of feds, local cops, and street thugs tear each other apart.

            This probably is mostly affecting inner-city kids.  But what I find the most disturbing is they want to change the definition of a kid for the purposes of foster care to 21.  That‚Äôs insane.I wonder if/when they will consider ‚Äòhomophobic‚Äô or ‚Äòracist‚Äô parents to be unfit to raise their children?
That‚Äôs really the problem. This is clownworld and so kids who genuinely need to be protected from their own parent‚Äôs abuse or neglect are ignored and kids from mariginally abnormal background who are poor will end up in the hands of uncaring or pedo foster parents.

                Parts of it don‚Äôt seem sinister on their face, but children‚Äôs services is often a particularly brutal example of  the frightening nature of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from the government and I‚Äôm here to help you.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs busybodies with the force of government behind them and the authority to tell you how to raise your kids. Since it is ‚Äúfor the children‚Äù they never feel guilty for what they do.On its face this statement from the EO sounds fine, ‚ÄúMy Administration has been focused on prevention strategies that keep children safe while strengthening families so that children do not enter foster care unnecessarily.¬†Last year, and for only the second time since 2011, the number of children in the foster care system declined, and for the third year in a row, the number of children entering foster care has declined.‚Äùhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-strengthening-child-welfare-system-americas-children/But I am way too familiar with government bureaucracies. They need to justify ever increasing budgets, and they can‚Äôt do that in the long run by having fewer children in the system. Also, the great power of government is the power to destroy. In this case, to destroy the family.The EO requires vast amount of information and tracking at the federal level. It is impossible for remote bureaucrats in Washington to understand the human dimensions of the millions of families affected by this. I will necessarily result in a numbers-based approach that allows all these state, federal and local bureaucrats to continue to justify their jobs and the expansion of their feifdoms.Basically, this EO will do for children‚Äôs services what federalized education standards have done to local public schools ‚Äî turn them into slaves to federal metrics and targets, regardless of the effect on their local charges.As we talk to governors and state leaders, we are asking them to¬†extend the foster care age from 18 to 21This makes adults into clients of the state, further establishing a paternal relationship with and attitude toward the state that may last a lifetime.Expanding the number of homes for children and youth.The only ways to do this involve more money for foster parents and/or less stringent certification. Foster parents ‚Äújust in it for the money‚Äù are already a thing. What will be the unintended side effects of making it more lucrative? Or lowering certification standards?Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance to Federal, State, and local agencies on partnering with nongovernmental organizations.¬†This guidance shall include best practices for information sharing, providing needed services to families to support prevention of children entering foster care, family preservation, foster and adoptive home recruitment and retention, respite care, post-placement family support, and support for older youth.Do the one-size-fits-all recommendations of Washington bureaucrats have any possibility of being a good fit for every single one of the thousands of different communities around the US, no less the individuals? Who things that this ‚Äúguidance‚Äù shall be as coercive as the Title IX guidance that led to the criminalization of being a heterosexual male as US universities?The entire conceit of this is that adding a whole additional federal layer (or more) of graduates of Marxist Colleges of Social Work will make the system more responsive to the needs of the people at the bottom? When has that ever happened?

        ‚ÄúGo woke, go broke‚Äù will (maybe) be totally disproven if, as you pointed out, the printing of money from nothing doesn‚Äôt lead to some earth-shattering consequences (as opposed to some recession, depression and pain that‚Äôs localized to working and middle class people not in government sectors). For if we are in a simulation, or it‚Äôs all play money, then the house (or the dungeon master for you D &amp; D nerds) sets the rules, and we already know what the rules are: ‚ÄúGet woke or go broke.‚Äù I‚Äôm long past making fun of conspiracy theorists (the Epstein affair should have shut everyone up on this front) and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised that the main reason we‚Äôre being primed for the cashless society is that we‚Äôre getting ready for social capital to be tied to our solvency. ‚ÄúYes, Mr. Carlson, I know you‚Äôre worth millions of dollars, but your credit score says you haven‚Äôt attended a white fragility course in six months.

                This has been one of the most astounding things to me as well. My first thoughts were that the scale of things now, the tangled web of the global economy is so vast that it just hides the effects of all this‚Ä¶ Somehow. Secondly, it seems that some event is needed to make a vast collective of people or significant collection of business interests lose faith in the money supply and maybe that event has yet to happen. Additionally, I believe that a greater percentage of the population is now much easier to dupe.During the 2008 recession, whilst everybody I met was referring to a ‚Äòcredit crunch‚Äô I noted that almost nobody actually seemed to lessen their spending. Furthermore, many were not really affected at all ‚Äì they kept their jobs and knew hardly anyone who had lost theirs‚Ä¶ Like I said, it seemed that the severity of the event was hidden by the elasticity of the economic system.

                Infinite money printing has no consequences until the money printer no longer has the means to force its acceptance.  The US could print literal Monopoly money (including the old guy with the hat) and as long as it can violently force the world to accept it, it doesn‚Äôt matter.
This is why the US can print money and get away with it, but Argentina cannot.

Me, I‚Äôm praying for a right-wing takeover in the U.S., ideally led by Trump. If it doesn‚Äôt happen soon, like in a matter of months, the left will re-take power and never let it go.

                It does. Tptb have dumped unfathomable amounts of money via bailouts and deficit spending. In the past it pumped up the stock market without helping regular people.

As free money becomes ineffective they increasingly turn to censorship, violence, intimidation.  Tptb know the clock is ticking.

                Oh, we are getting inflation alright.  But the interest rate regime is engineered, not a marketplace.  So you get real inflation, a facade of ‚Äúno inflation‚Äù, and a zero-percent environment, so savers can‚Äôt even earn back the inflation.  In the ‚Äò70s, you could at least get the 12% CDs to counteract the inflation a bit.  You don‚Äôt even get that, now.

                    My first reaction was that Trump‚Äôs suggestion of delaying the election was a major goof. It would give all his enemies (i.e., most people in public life) an excuse to twist his proposal into something tyrannical.But his move could be a bold stroke. He won‚Äôt hold up the voting, and doesn‚Äôt expect to, but suddenly the idea of ‚Äúcheat by mail‚Äù is out there in front of the electorate big time. The media will deliver the phrase to many normies who otherwise might not see it.Trump is no 4D chess player, but sometimes he is a clever one-dimensional player. This may be a case of inciting the Left to publicize an idea that is dangerous to them.

                    That‚Äôs a good question and one I have given a lot of thought, actually.The Cloud People want to establish imperium under the pretense of democracy and citizen participation. Doing so allows them to criticize Putin and others about autocracy and so forth. They then can assure the masses that their will is honored. Sure, it‚Äôs a totally hypocritical sham but so is most propaganda, particularly when blended with virtue signaling. So the Rulers prefer to operate under the patina of democracy and would like to maintain its trappings to hold up results as proof of their moral superiority and legitimacy.This is why you see two tracks taking place. The first is the obvious ops in the forms of the Covid overreaction and racial violence against Whites. The idea is to guilt-trip Whites so that they vote to make it all stop, and the victory of their candidate can be held up as a democratic election. This is the preferred track.The second track is outright voter fraud in the form of mail-in ballots and related chicanery. The fraud will be memoryholed and the results presented as legitimate.Both of these are based on the Soviet model. If it is any cold comfort, our Ruling Class is pretty fucking stupid compared to the old Reds.

                        Alex Jones was talking about satanism at some point.He said that satanists need to convince population(sometimes using threats &amp; force)  to go along with their plans. By voting democrat or not voting at all, satanists will become absolved of their sins, they can then claim you asked for vaccines, abortion &amp; pornography.Never cuckhold, vote Trump, let them screech for not getting their way.

                    Because there is a risk of internecine violence. Not Right to Left though a  lack of an election could cause succession or war but Left to Left.The Lerftists are very far from unified and most of the street fighting you see in Blue areas and meant to intimidate other Blues.This power struggle is profound, the older Left many actually aging out are fairly sane, Socially Democratic, Market Socialist  looter types and not Anti anybody really and the younger crowd are no breaks full bore Communists many man children who don‚Äôt understand consequences since they lived in a low consequence world of privilege.Having them riot over social nonsense serves two  ends, it pisses off the Right which is good fun, keeps them busy and away from going Red.That is folly, the Reds are much smarter than that but the sane Left is well getting old.

                Why? If you can keep up the facade of fair elections, yet defraud the process, why stop? All that counts is that you are assured your candidate wins. MX used this for 70 years starting in early 20th century and no Mexican seemed willing to pick up a rifle and again start a revolution‚Äîwhich was the tried and true method of regime change prior.
Look for any Federal law mandating State election changes, such as vote by mail, same day registration, electronic balloting, electoral college rollback, age reduction, etc.   That‚Äôs your key tell.

                    As to your last, they don‚Äôt need legislation. The courts are mandating voting requirements such as mail-in ballots in some jurisdictions, basically giving judicial blessing to ballot fraud. That makes United States elections all the more valid on paper, you see.The analogy to Mexico is pretty well spot on. After 71 years of sham elections (probably not as bad as what happens to the norte these days), the PRI  retained power and Mexico was presented as the model of Latin American democracy, which the colossal train wreck to the north apparently thought included the United States.

                Even some of the worst tyrannies ‚Äì still held elections. The illusion of even somebody like Stalin being ‚Äúelected‚Äù is an important one to uphold because there‚Äôs still a sizeable portion of the population that takes their Soma and believes it.When elections are COMPLETELY cancelled ‚Äì the tyranny must increase the clampdown just that much more to keep order ‚Äì because now nothing but naked power is ruling the place.So we either end up with elections that are complete and total sham ‚Äì as most tyrannies in history  have done,  or ‚Äì if they‚Äôre canceled we end up in a hot civil war in short order because the naked power that will have to be used to keep order at that point will send at least some people running for their guns.

            Trump has been worse for WN than a Leftie.  He enrages the Left base, emboldens Our Guys to believe they have his support, then he sics the dogs on us himself.  He‚Äôs pardoned more Jewish drug dealers and slimy political fixers than hard Right guys who supported him in 2015-2017.  And he hasn‚Äôt even served as a speed bump on the Globoshlomo agenda.Orange Soma makes Whitey go to sleep thinking tough-Tweeting Donny will protect them.  I want a Leftie in office so Whitey stays awake, alert and realistic about who his enemies are.Homeland is hardly professional as it stands.  There are a hard-core of ex-military paras but even those ranks are getting thinner as the Forever Wars 2.0 have failed to launch.  FBI and ATF are well-past their salad days of Waco and they‚Äôve grown soft taking down ‚ÄúHomeland-grown‚Äù conspiracies that have more federal membership than the 1970‚Äôs KKK.Given the hair-on-fire diaper panic that Shlomo has stoked in the last 4 years, the J-men have few WN scalps to show for it.Our Guys have learned some basic discipline and threat-spotting and we‚Äôre doing a much better job of policing our ranks.  The Alt-Lite and others who‚Äôve tried to stay inside the fences have had more problems with glowfag infiltration than the hard Right since Charlottesville.

        the yard-apes must be us the beans, or a hybrid ape in several cases.nevertheless, good parable. those stupid birds can be soulless can they. a lizard is cold and clammy, the bird is simply phlegmatic. both are gross, but one can be eaten at least. glad to be a part-yard-ape mowing lawns and getting clannish over family soccer preferences.will whites wake up? who knows, they watch ‚Äúgo woke go broke‚Äù vids on youtube and otherwise go about feeding the machine anyway, every day. they are closer to the truth than when they were into watching Jordan Peterson in 2017, true; but, still too far before the demographic cookie crumbles. (JBP did help a bit, he did introduce the IQ curves to many)it‚Äôs simple, a virtual dissidence is stuck in screens owned by the oligarchs forever. a stand in the real world will eventually have to happen. however, for it to be considered a stand and not incel terrorism, it will need to be meek, respectful, willing to shed blood in defense only. keep going to your statues, keep defending. don‚Äôt do jackboots, don‚Äôt do tiki-cringe, don‚Äôt bring guns or knives even, don‚Äôt cower in the car and floor it either. just stand around, prayers and meditations, maybe a cane at most, even say ‚Äúall races come from God‚Äù but of course explain why yours matters and thus why the statues need to be kept. and otherwise keep meek and chill.no, you barely will convert anyone among them, and they will probably overrun many early defenders, while they will use their hypothetical casualties to discredit you more. but, maybe those who would be on our side but are idiotically sitting on wrong fences or wasting time, afraid of what their rebellious wives/pozzed kids/corporate boss will say, would see the early sacrifices of seemingly common and ordinary people trying to do a noble deed: and realize what happens, and convert to the cause. because first we have to win the psyop battle, then the recruits for anything else will arrive, finally convinced to have manned up.St. Ignatius, pray for us, that we get martial spirit, even for needed sacrifice.

        Spot on about the Lizard people not having the numbers. They don‚Äôt, my guess is that you could fit all the shot callers into a HS stadium and still have room left over.Look at Antifa. They have to bus their goons in from across the country. BLM  is no different and has become quite ‚Äúwhite‚Äù in terms of membership.Look if the Lizard peoplet had the numbers on their side they ought to be able to put a million person march  but they can‚Äôt. They can/t even do a 100,000 inan march in  a major city.  What they do have is political benefactors in the blue hives and towns. plus control of the MSM.Bottom line they are not invulnerable, What is lacking on our side is the awarenss  of their small numbers as Zman has pointed out.

        Much like the mini-series V in the early 80‚Äôs (a masterpiece) you have a lizard person in an orange suit running our country.  If you clawed away the skin on his face you found find just another lizard, like Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi (unmasked lizards).  Schumer even uses his tongue like a lizard when speaking.  Right now the lizard in the orange suit is seen as an attacked, picked on, champion of these fighting people.  In reality he needs to be exposed as the fraud like he is.  What enrages me most is the fight I‚Äôm currently having with my own family that watches Fox News (well masked lizard people with fake tits who wear pumps) and swear that this picked on man in orange isn‚Äôt a lizard.  The same man who said he wants the election delayed (playing RIGHT INTO THE HANDS of the lizard game plan) which not to mention is prima facie unconstitutional, not that that matters.

        Excellent analogy. Now what next? The intelligent answer is to do what ‚Äúworks‚Äù in the evolutionary sense. So how do you get rid of a disease festering in the upper ranks of the power pyramid? Focus. Keep it simple. Use what you know. Operate solely within your own skull as the innocuous every-man that you are. Be opportunistic and spontaneous. One man (or woman) can make a big difference. Now multiple by a few hundred thousand, and the disease will lock itself into self-imposed prisons.

            This problem is not going to magically fix itself. We need to get to children. This is how we got to this point.  Our enemies took over everything kids. They used the young adults they themselves produced to deal the knockout blow to the culture and now you can‚Äôt even mention yourself without disavowing yourself.  Self-consciousness in white people is absolutely forbidden. Until this is knocked over completely, there is no chance things will get better. Things will continue to slowly get worse and worse until we are being murdered on a mass scale. This is not hyperbole. That is the whole point of white privilege and systemic oppression and all of the other anti-white oppression narrative. It is to justify violence against us. The only reason it is not happening already is there are too many of us. That is quickly changing.

                Homeschooling as parents or within our own communities is the most important thing you can do beyond keeping your kids physically safe.
If we grow our numbers the old-fashioned way and raise those kids right, they‚Äôll have the same resistance to poz that little Wokies have to red-pilling and be well-positioned to hold ground and take some back.
As Aristotle said, ‚Äúgive me a child until he is 7 and I will show you the man.‚Äù The fundamentals of character and your moral tone are largely set in your childhood.

                    I couldn‚Äôt imagine subjecting a child to a public school.  Like going to the DMV for brain surgery.

                        I actually did the opposite. From roughly 1st through 5th grades, I was in an incipient hoity-toity private school in Northern VA (early 1970s), the kind that taught French to second or third graders. Even socially maladjusted me could tell something wasn‚Äôt right. At least the way I recall it, I asked and parents agreed, let me go to the local public school instead. I know I was happier there and did better. For what it‚Äôs worth, all the schools involved were 99.9% white at the time üôÇ While I didn‚Äôt stay in touch, I think the preppy private school got even hoity-toity-er in later decades!

            I‚Äôm inclined to think it will reverse itself, but the time line will be generational.  Looks to be in the 70 year range looking at Russia and China and MX for example.  Not sure we will ever revert back to what we were due to population mix, but the old regimes lost legitimacy and direction turned even with faux elections.
But what do I know.  If I knew anything, I‚Äôd have tried to prevent the decline, instead I realize I helped it along for most of my political life.  So much for being a participating citizen in our ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù.

                I‚Äôm of the mind that this goes back to the depression, and, American society not being naturally top-down, it took longer to develop and was more mentally than physically brutal. The corollary is that it will also take longer to unwind.  I think it‚Äôs already ending. Perhaps the imminence of physical violence will be the trigger that finally snaps people out of the mental prison.
