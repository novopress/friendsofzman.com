        “…I don’t see any soup lines either.”
1. You’re looking in the wrong places. There are soup lines. I spent several months this year as a volunteer chef at one.
2. SNAP has helped hide the soup lines. Now the government just gives you a faux credit card and loads you up each month electronically.

        since we’re talking about being wrong, I think a post you made while back about Amazon may qualify . but everyone is wrong at least once

        Tocqueville-When Europeans landed in China three hundred years ago, they found there that almost all the arts had reached a certain degree of perfection and were surprised that they had not improved beyond that point. The Chinese, in following the path of their ancestors, had mislaid the reasons for the direction the latter had chosen. They still used the formula without asking why; they kept the tool but they had lost the skills to adapt or replace it. The Chinese were, therefore, not able to change anything and had to abandon any notion of improvement. The well of human knowledge had dried up and although the flow still ran, it could neither increase its volume nor change its course.We should not, therefore, complacently think that the barbarians are still far away for, if some nations allow the torch to be snatched from their hands, others stamp it out themselves.

        We don’t see soup lines because we give out SNAP cards. Today’s queues would dwarf those of the 1930s if the SNAP card holders had to stand in line to be fed.

        If productivity climbs high enough, the cloud people won’t need to boss the rest of us around.  They will constitute the inner party.  The technicians who keep the whole thing running will be the outer party.  They can then sterilize or euthanize the proles… maybe keep some breeding stock on reservations for risk mitigation and local color.  Maybe all of those mountains of debt just won’t matter in the end.

        No one is wrong because they will tell you later there are always so many factors coming into play. Therefore reasonably it can be argued that even a cast-iron prediction will soon reveal that there were many other elements and influences (perhaps unseen) which couldn’t be assessed at the time.
In other words, all predictions have wiggle room to allow the predictor to wriggle free. Like all those recurring predictions of the end of the world which seem to miss, it’s only because apparently divine forces can change his/her/its mind. But who on earth could predict that, hey?

        I think you had it right before, when you mentioned how much slack there is in the system to absorb the huge fuck ups that have happened over the last 20-30 years. All the predictions about The Great Collapse ™ seem to ignore that slack and hence they’ve all been shown to be wrong since they work only off past observations where fuck ups had large, immediate effects from the go.
Future predictions need to take that slack into account before we can guess when the next crash will be. Or what the aftermath will look like for that matter.

            There’s a great deal of carry over in human societies. Mistakes made in one generation can cast a shadow over two or three generations. The reverse is true too. The West has not had any real competition from outside since Charles Martel. America has not had a real competitor since 1945. That’s changing. The Romans ate from the fruit of Augustus for a very long time so America could very well be living off the smashing success of the 20th century for a long time too. But like bankruptcy, crisis happens slowly and then all of a sudden.

                Victor Davis Hanson – among others – makes the same point re: California.  2015 California is living off the fruit of infrastructure from decades ago.   Parts of this state are wonderful, if outlandishly expensive.  Meanwhile, huge and growing swaths are indistinguishable from the suburbs of Tijuana.  Cloud people – Ground people for sure.
