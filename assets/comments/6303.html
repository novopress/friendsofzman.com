        Rebels will be rebels, no matter the situation. Conservatives are now cool, we’re speaking the truths that must not be spoken, and rebels are drawn to that like butterflies to crap. People who want to throw sand in gears will always gravitate to the societal underdog, and now that’s us. You can look for a whole new class of edgy “conservatives” to spring up.

        I was putting together a couple of lectures for the last unit of my US History class- and the books that we use have titles for these chapters like “The Triumph of Conservatism”, or some such. What a load of crap. The story of my life is the expansion of what Z calls the managerial state. Reagan and Thatcher were maybe speed bumps that slowed its expansion down, an expansion that began, not with Franklin, but with Teddy Roosevelt. I find myself increasingly pessimistic as I watch western civilization collapse. It’s 450 AD, and we are in Rome! Humphrey Appleby Rules, OK!

        The Republican Party and its so-called conservative intelligentsia do not oppose any part of the welfare state system that has been installed since the first FDR administration. The Republican Party is a center-left party of the European tradition, and it is dominated by its liberal wing. Nelson Rockefeller won after all.The Democrat Party is a full-blown socialist party dominated by its Communist wing. I capitalize Communist because they are true Marxist-Leninists, with a touch of Stalinism.This is the system the American people support by a large majority. The current Trump ascendancy is not about economics (everyone is a leftist there), it is about the destruction of the White majority and the coming oppression of White people. That is why the National Review and all its writers are irrelevant.I suspect that eventually the Republican Party will become a White Nationalist Socialist party, but that remains to be seen.

        You have seen nothing yet…Barry Hussein had eight years to put his jihadis in the right place, and even before that, I have reasons to believe that the work was started early by these Saudi puppets called “Arbustos”… Alwaleed bin Talal  took control of Fox for a reason…You think that “conservative” levee against the Donald is natural? Trump will have to be a war leader just like Churchill was.

        Yes, yes, yes.
Liberty is the hardest test one can inflict on a people. To know how to be free is not given equally to all people and all nations–Paul Valery
People instinctively love freedom, but dislike liberty.  We confuse one with the other in our ignorance, but liberty is revolutionary, and it is the only political state which exist in continual revolution. We appear to have given up that fight between 1861 and 1933, but the inertia of that great experiment carried us a long way. Cicero’s lament.

        “Further, there’s no need for an intellectual defense of the western culture as the Left has won all the battles, taking command of all the high ground in the culture.”
This post is your rationale for surrender as you make clear with the above statement.
