        Your constitution is all sail and no anchor. As I said before, when a society has entered on this downward progress, either civilisation or liberty must perish. Either some Caesar or Napoleon will seize the reins of government with a strong hand; or your republic will be as fearfully plundered and laid waste by barbarians in the twentieth Century as the Roman Empire was in the fifth;—with this difference, that the Huns and Vandals who ravaged the Roman Empire came from without, and that your Huns and Vandals will have been engendered within your own country by your own institutions.— Thomas Babington Macaulay, letter to Henry Stephens Randall, May 23, 1857.—The Letters of Thomas Babington Macaulay, ed. Thomas Pinney, vol. 6, p. 96 (1981).

        …I think UKer’s comment is much closer to the mark today than the Zman’soriginal post.Immigration &amp; inner city black dysfunction are not outlier issues,but like a duck’s feet they move unseen below the surface.In NYC, people pay extra to live in doorman-ed buildings not just because they want to have someone hold the door for them.In other areas they chose gated communities, or move to the suburbs for ‘better schools’ for their special snowflakes, because they understand these issues.They keep voting with their feet whenever they get the chance.But most also understand that no one can discuss any of this without being denounced as a ‘racist’ – followed by being tossed from the rampartsby your employer, publisher, and ‘polite’ society.They understand that they will be permanently exiled to live with the dissidentsin Sailerland.If you can defenstrate a Nobel prize winner like Watson, or a Harvard PhD like Richwine, and at the same time give an Al Sharpton regular White House access, then everyone who’s paying attention gets the message about how things stand in the New Americuh.…

        Normally I agree with a lot of what you say, Z. But… “Modern elections are always over some problem that needs solving and the winner is almost always the one promising a solution” just isn’t true, at least on this side of the pond.The winner of our election in just over month’s time will almost 100 per cent not be looking at the big issue in our society. Last night we had one of those feeble ‘television debates’ that the UK has copied from other places. The leader of UKIP, who is the only one to spell out the problem of unfettered immigration and the soaring coasts attached to educating, housing, maintaining and (largely unsaid) trying to keep the lid on a boiling pot of ethnic-and-religious-originated tensions, got a cold shoulder from the various lefties on the platform with him.The lefties here talk for example about more trade union power, reducing our armed forces further, building bigger wind farms, being nice to everyone who hates us because this would guarantee peace. These don’t come close to the one big issue that is affecting a small, already overcrowded and essentially bankrupt island: we can’t keep on taking the feckless and the indolent and the unstable just because it makes someone who lives in a (for the moment) safe part of London feel good about themselves. If the EU says we should take in yet more, as Farage points out, that is hardly the independence that the Welsh and the Scots rattle on about. But that is won’t be what the winner (or increasingly the coalition winners) in this coming election will say is important. it isn’t an issue that raises a blip on the radar of the varieties of weak-willed socialists who claim “to speak for the people.”I used to live in Rotherham, and I have seen what’s going on in a town with no money but with socialists firmly in control. Nasty and may well get nastier, but across the dinner tables in the better parts of London the abuse of young girls by ‘asian’ men (note that no one dare mentions they are muslim males) isn’t anything that concerns them. Not an issue they or their preferred government will need to address, and they will be among the winners in the next coalition gang-bang.I am sure in the States you have issues that the two main parties won’t adequately address, come 2016. I imagine they will talk around them but never concede the big one which matters to the ordinary voter.Anyway, to Greece. There is a joke about this:A German banker turns up in a Greek town and books a room at the local hotel. In the morning he asks the manager to look after a 500 Euro banknote and then goes for a stroll. The manager rushes out another door and goes to the butcher and uses the banknote to pay off his debt. The butcher hurries to the repair garage and pays off his motor vehicle debt with the note. The garage owner dashes to the local prostitute and settles his debt with her. She then in turn heads to the hotel to pay off her debt for the renting of a room.When the German gets back to the hotel the 500 Euro note is waiting for him and he leaves behind a town in which all debts have been paid.And who said the EU wasn’t smart?

            The election may not be over the problem you and I would place at the top of our list, that’s for certain. They may not be about the topic at the top of most people’s list. But, they are about some set of problems of interest to the public. In America, the party primaries will surely be about who can win in the general. That’s an easy one as it reduces the election to a talent show. It is easy for TV and easy for most voters.The thing with immigration is that is appears to be an outlier. Eventually, any issue of importance to the public becomes important to the political markets. That’s what’s so strange about immigration.

                Speaking of talent show, i remember a woman telling me once that she preferred Obama because he has the best singing voice and would totally win America’s Got Talent!
And that joke is not far fetched, as most ECB money for Greece flows right back into German banks…
