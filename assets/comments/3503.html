        GOP Inc. needs a repeat of the 2012 Santorum/Gingrich slugfest that kept the Tea Party and snake handler vote (which is now the same thing) distracted while their guy sprints up the middle.  When Christie imploded by kissing Obama and pissing off Jersey commuters, it looked like Romney might step in to replay the anointed RINO role, but now that Jeb seems to be learning his lines the old trouper won’t have to tread the boards again.  Besides, while Jeb’s got his own baggage, he’s actually a more attractive candidate than Romney.The Huckser is pretty much in.  I say Santorum’s a definite.  Ben Carson too.  Contrary to your prediction, Ted Cruz will run, because his ego demands it, and because it is now or never.  By the next cycle no one will remember his name.  Cruz could only make headlines as a member of the minority party; in a Republican dominated Senate he become invisible.  GOP Inc. will encourage Cruz in his folly, because he will further divide the field, and because a crushing primary loss might weaken him to the point that his Senate seat is jeopardized.Rand Paul will likely run, but as a favor to GOP Inc.  Vacuuming up the libertarian vote will help Jeb.  It will cost Paul his Senate seat, but as Paul seems already to be auditioning for VP, my guess is that deal has already been made.  If I were on the planning committee at GOP Inc., I’d sign that contract.  Romney would be President now if he’d offered the job to Rand instead of to his malfunctioning clone, Paul Ryan.  Rand Paul is good at playing bad cop; he can beat down the likes of Huckabee and Santorum while Jeb stands above the fray and looks Presidential.  Paul can also move outside the conservative box with greater freedom, as he just did on Cuba.  GOP Inc. supports Obama’s surprise attempt at rapprochement, but can’t openly say so for political reasons.  I think Paul’s recent evisceration of the deluded and doltish Marco Rubio was a message from Mitch McConnell to Rubio that he needs to step back in line.  Rubio hoped to ride an immigration deal to the White House, but he blew it and helped make the issue toxic.  When your boss has to step in and clean up your mess, you’re done.  He may yelp and growl a little, but Bush’s poodle will not be a factor in 2016.Two wild card in the mix.  I still think there is a very good chance that Christie flips and runs as a Democrat.  If he does, Obama will endorse him as a final fuck-you to the Clintons.  It’s a big risk, but one with a lot of upside.  If Christie flips and runs as a conservative Democrat, he stands a very good chance of getting elected President.Also, if Santorum stops bitching about birth control and fumbling with his Rosary in public, locks down on immigration and goes after the white working class vote, he could become a real factor in the primary.  Last Labor Day he gave an excellent speech on the subject at the Family Leadership Summit.  But he’s going to be reliant on big donors again, who are usually open borders, so they might just tell him to stick to the script and rant about gay marriage.

        He played a similar role in the 2008 primary.  When it was just Mccain, Romney and Huckabee that remained, he purposefully refused to drop out, even though it was mathematically impossible for him to win.
He ensured Mccain’s victory by siphoning away enough Romney votes to himself.  He has a long history of playing the part of political spoiler.
