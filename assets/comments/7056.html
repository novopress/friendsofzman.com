        The one upside of Obama‚Äôs efforts of spreading out the Section 8 housing into rich white districts is that it‚Äôll teach rich white people the downside of diversity first hand.  States with over 10% blacks vote Trump in the primaries because they know the score.  States that are lily white vote Cruz because they haven‚Äôt had the first hand experience to counter the  ‚Äúdiversity is good‚Äù mantra from the media and pop culture.
The quickest way to form an Alt-Right majority is to spread the diversity around deep into white neighborhoods.

                I disagree. Trying to explain the concept that ‚Äòcultural diversity‚Äô is synonymous with destruction is about as fruitful as trying to explain to someone from the swamps Florida how dangerous the desert is. Humans do not fear ignorance, particularly in America now. The vast majority of people I know who are aware just how destructive the Magic Dirt Theory is, are those who come into contact with its absurdities on a daily or weekly basis. Those forced to deal with the Escalades and 60‚Ä≥ Sony flatscreen TVs bought by those who apparently must have rent-controlled housing and SNAP cards to live. If all American‚Äôs were required to experience Chiraq, the national mood would change within a week. The only thing that breaks through the idiocy and cultural daze is bodies. Lots of bodies. It‚Äôs unfortunate, and I don‚Äôt wish it on anyone, but that is reality. Things only matter when they will directly affect you, and that is the only way things will change.

                    What you say appears to be coming to fruition.  Everyday there‚Äôs more about how ‚Äúwhites‚Äù are becoming affected by urban migration to the burbs.  For example, heroin is apparently running rampant all over now.  It‚Äôs cheap and suffices when your doctor prescribed oxy runs out.  Now we need rehab centers in my local town, so they say.  We didn‚Äôt care when it was destroying black families and cities.

        the Cult says Brown vs. Board of Ed. must always be praised ‚Äì can‚Äôt people see what it led to? the Cult says the 13th, 14th &amp; 15th amendments must always be praised (‚Äúaren‚Äôt we wonderful to be so fair?‚Äù) yet the results are not good! the historical sentiments behind these things must always be praised AS IF the results were wonderful. this drive for fairness (that ignores biology) for every special snowflake is toppling our already administrator-heavy institutions ‚Äì &amp; our country.

        Having done property management for years I can assure you bad tenants drive out good tenants, not the other way around. I have never seen good tenants drive out a bad tenant. Good tenants just quietly move. Obama is the nation‚Äôs greatest idiot. Perhaps one of the world‚Äôs all time greatest idiots on par with Nero and for sure James Earl Carter.Hat tip to my NSA minder. Stuff it you a-hole.

        The non-honky merely applies for and gets a government job, much to the same effect.  If you‚Äôre feeling oppressed, trust me, it‚Äôs a gov‚Äôt hire that copied and pasted nice-sounding paragraphs into an edict, sanction, code, or penalty.

        A great many whites had the burden of being a good example laid on them early in life.  Also an unshakeable belief that the great white way of doing things, contrary to their own multicultural beliefs, is superior to all others and should be emulated.

            Sure ‚Äì and it rubbed off on the few black kids I went to school with in the 99% white town of my childhood.  They ended up culturally ‚Äúwhite‚Äù (the kind of black people Hollywood likes to mock).  Probably didn‚Äôt hurt they had 2-parent families stable and affluent enough to maintain a household in the suburbs.

        Given the past five decades it is difficult to accept the premise that leftists want to improve black lives with Magic Dirt.
After the Baltimore and Ferguson riots blacks lamented they wanted to destroy more property but could not because there is nothing of value in their communities.
Destroying white communities and lives is the only goal.

        This article, while making a lot of good points, is a tad collectivist for my taste. What about treating people as individuals? Of course landlords should be able to rent to anyone (or not) for any reason they please. The reason the ruling class disallows that is not because of any concern for the feelings of dark brown people, but because ‚ÄúDivide and Conquer‚Äù.

        Look at the Roman Empire, or the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and how many countries they both were broken up into, and you will have an idea about the future of the US, after the diversity trolls get their way. Homogeneity is what make nations strong, diversity is what makes them weak. No family that is as diverse as the US would survive intact, why would anyone think that a larger scale of something dysfunctional would work? Nature itself shows that like belongs with like. When one natural group encounters another, in the wild, one usually eats the other.

        ‚ÄúAsk these people why diversity is good and they start mumbling about their favorite Ethiopian restaurant.‚Äù
If they do manage to come up with something else (not yet) then ask them how it is that an Ethiopian is preferable to honky while retaining their non-racial bona fides. You know, diversity is good and so there must be something better about the Ethiopian‚Äìbut there is no difference; since racism and yet there must be since we neurotically celebrate diversity‚Ä¶ Sort of an infinite loop of idiocy really.

        This election is resembling the 1992 election with Trump being Perot and I think this on purpose, the Cult Elders loved Bill Clinton, his policies of ‚Äòsocial liberal, fiscal conservative and imperial expansion‚Äô is what they always wanted, the Cult Elders HATE the GOP and its voter base even when they swear loyalty to them and do everything they want.
The Cult Elders are using Trump to destroy the GOP and get Hillary elected, you will see it in November.

            Your argument rests on an absurd assumption‚Äì that the ‚ÄúCult Elders‚Äù would destroy something that has been so incredibly useful to them, namely, the GOP. Maybe you haven‚Äôt noticed the the GOP leadership is virtually indistinguishable from the Democrat leadership? No, Trump is universally opposed by everyone running both parties for a reason: he is threatening to blow up something that is quite valuable to all of them. As far as Hillary is concerned‚Äì they don‚Äôt necessarily care about Hillary one way or the other, that‚Äôs why they wanted someone like ¬°Jeb! or Marco to oppose her. When you own both candidates, it doesn‚Äôt matter who gets elected, you win either way. They only care about Hillary now because Trump has blown up one half of their equation. They are trying to set Ted Cruz up as a Designated Loser¬Æ but they know he can‚Äôt win enough delegates to fill the role under the existing nomination rules, so right now they are using him as a cudgel to beat Trump with until they can figure out a new plan. Obviously rigging the convention is at the top of the list of preferred solutions but even if Trump gets blown out in Wisconsin (where he was weak anyway even before his recent missteps) he‚Äôll most likely still bring enough delegates to the convention to win. They are flailing around and it‚Äôs pretty easy to imagine that assassination is moving rapidly up their solution list. And it looks like inciting race war is right up there too. It‚Äôs going to be an interesting summer.
