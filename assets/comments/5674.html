        A friend posted about the new California assisted suicide law on social media and I broke my previously iron-clad rule of never commenting on anything political or ethical amongst the unwashed. Youth in Asia just really riles me for any number of historical, philosophical, and moral reasons. I closed my screed with “this law will be abused,” and to your point, one of the moonbats on the thread who had been cheerleading the culture of death replied, “Every law is flawed.”  But some are more flawed than others, Snowball.
