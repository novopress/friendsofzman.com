        Artificial interest rates have robbed the elderly middle class  of 500 billion a year to the Utopian coffers. Without a peep, I will add.
Oh, the things people take for granted. We will know exactly what a high trust society is only when we no longer are one.

        Deadbeats get financed because the financiers can syndicate and sell the (deadbeat) loans to some other entity before the SHTF.  Just as things went in our housing bubble of a few years ago, the “greater fool” theory in action.  Yet another way the VC crowd strips assets.

        If anything, the current Greek crisis signals the end of lending money and hoping it gets repaid. The new expectation is going to be if you lend money, there is virtually no chance of it being repaid.There is a saying that if you borrow 1,000 dollars or pounds or euros or whatevers from a bank and can’t repay it, you have a problem. However borrow a million and can’t repay it and then the bank has a problem.In other words, you may as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.Assuming Greece ‘renegotiates’ its debt then how do they ever borrow money again, given their track record? I am not against Greece protesting the unfairness of it all, though equally they originally signed up for the eurozone with no great protests, but this changes the face of big-scale money lending and borrowing.The way businesses work is a mystery to most people, but it has always been the same. Back when I was a wee lad my father told me that the old behemoth Woolworth would go to a supplier, say of knives and forks and spoons, and offer to take their products. Good, and if it sold well, Woollies would go back to the business and ask for even more. The cutlery manufacturer, the sound of cash tills ringing in his ears, would take on more staff, buy more raw materials, maybe move to bigger premises. He was committed. Then Woolworth would say, ‘ah, we need to lower the price to sell more, and that means less income for you but hey, it will help sales.’ But only to a point: soon the manufacturer would be working even harder for less profit, and then another price slash and he would be doing it for free or worse. If Woollies then dropped the line of cutlery, the manufacturer was utterly screwed.So if this happened in say the middle of the 20th century, why do we think this sort of approach and practice no longer applies?

        One would think Greek Communists would be just the guys to hang ’em. I wonder what has changed to tame them.

        Nailed it!  Clearest explanation I have seen on the subject.
This Pan Pacific Trade fiasco is just the cherry on top, for the asset strippers.
And Warren Buffet has a special place in his big heart for the little people, yeah, right.
