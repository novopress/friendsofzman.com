        Saw yesterday where a man confronted Lizzie Gibs about her plan to cancel college loan debt. He pointed out that he worked two jobs, didn‚Äôt take vacations, and didn‚Äôt buy a bunch of toys so he could responsibly pay his off.Meanwhile, his neighbor who built his house of sand did none of those things, was going to skip out on his obligations courtesy of her.She seemed to think that it was funny and even then wanted to shake his hand and have his support.A great writer like Shakespeare would have made up such a scene in order to demonstrate what is happening to our legacy population, and how those who have sold us out enjoy it.As flies to wanton boys, we are to the godsThey kill us for their sport.

        About the impeach-MINT farce.Last year I dragged mysel to the executive meeting for our rod and gun club. As you might imagine there were a LOT of seniors involved‚Ä¶ and I left halfway through, vowing never to return. They fought about the STUPIDEST chit you can imagine! Instead of tending to the club‚Äôs business and interests, it as basically a grumpy old man dog fight.When you look at the Donk leadership‚Ä¶ it speaks for itself. Biden forgets where he is and starts prattling. The fake Indian can‚Äôt handle any dissent or opposition whatsoever. Bernie‚Äôs had a stroke. Pelosi is senile AND soaked in gin more often than not.Every single one of them should be playing cards down at the senior‚Äôs centre. The party burns while they shuffle around in Velcro shoes and squishy adult diapers.We live in glorious times!üòÜüëç

        Not a comment on the podcast but on your statement that ‚Äúit seems clear that people like Adam Schiff really do believe this stuff. He thinks the Cossacks are warming up, waiting for Trump to give the signal. He is a deranged lunatic, who belongs in an asylum.‚Äù You are missing something here. I do not think he believes any of this. You do not have to follow Q to see that he is a desperate man whose corruption, and the corruption of a large swath of our political class, is being threatened with exposure. The Biden family may be bigger pigs than most but there is zero reason to believe they are the only ones. Schiff believes, with good reason to my mind, that if Trump is re-elected, their whole cozy, corrupt set up could crash, with jail time a real possibility. It may never happen, but they look like they are terrified of what‚Äôs coming.

            The difference between reality and what is said about leadership is not only a message about the quality of the leadership, but is also a message about the coercive ability of the leadership to perpetuate the deception.  In an informed population (yeah, I know), that was actually allowed to express itself without severe penalty, pretense of leadership competence would be quickly dashed, when the truth is otherwise.

        How about this for a metric:  Quantify the tyranny by the number of times one is reminded of Huxley‚ÄôsBrave New Worldor Orwell‚Äôs1984.Whether its the anesthetization via teevee and smartphones, or the continual steaming cowpies from our Ministry of Truth, I estimate I‚Äôm reminded of these books about 1000-times more than I was 30 years ago.

        ‚ÄúThe only angle to this thing of any interest to me is the bizarre circling back to the Russian collusion hoax‚Äù
The thing that has amazed me over the decades is how the ruling class lies to the people all the time and they continue to get away with it. The only sure thing is that any ‚Äúofficial story‚Äù is false. I first saw this with the JFK assassination coverup, but it has been repeated on many fronts down through the years.
Does anyone here really believe the 9-11 story from the government?

                A_S, I had jury duty the other day and just under half of the prospective jurors had filled out their surveys incorrectly and had to be helped by the clerk in completing a new form.    Very basic stuff.   Not at all encouraging.

Heh, no, and I think you mean ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù, not story. But then too the 9/11 truthers movement was a also high-powered magnet that efficiently attracted a prolific amount of stupid people.

            Isn‚Äôt that historically true though? The Great Unwashed have always been manipulated or lied to. The key has always been: can the ruling elite provide for the masses. Nevermind how risible our ruling elite is; they are able to provide comfort to the citizenry (i.e. mass media, drugs, $5 chickens, rent-to-own, etc.). When that falls, the elite falls. And then the Great Unwashed will start seeing through the BS. (Though I worry that the G.U. won‚Äôt come to our side as much as grab weapons and murder each other.) I guess my point is to get as many people on our side as possible, and hope that we get political power somehow, and return the country to sanity.

        TBH, the reason people were interested in the Clinton impeachment were the salacious details, drama/morality play (adultery!), and partisanship, not the civics lesson.  Such is human nature.  The Trump impeachment is not even good theater.

        Does Schiff really believe his insanity? Dunno. But my take is he is frustrated the counter-arguments even exist; it drives him and the ruling class absolutely insane. While average Americans  are dumber than rocks, even they find this BS hard to swallow. The ruling class‚Äô madness is fueled by its awareness the propaganda no longer is effective or as effective. Repression will increase but probably won‚Äôt have much of an effect.
This isn‚Äôt ending well because the ruling class is just as stupid as the ruled.

            Schiff is a friendless, perverted, embittered old faggot who finally has his chance to destroy the big, bad, successful heterosexual White man and his women who made him feel so inadequate as a youth.  Schiff speaks for millions of screeching liberal losers, male, female, or undecided.  And he just may succeed in tilting at this particular windmill.

        Behind the throne not sitting on it.The little hats are successful when they go unnoticed. They understand this. In part due to tribal chutzpah and to the rapidly growing number of people catching on, they have chosen to move into the limelight.¬† As with the Obama coronation, much too soon.Schiff is a very good example of both their increased aggression driven by panic and how awkward they are in handling this role.¬† So close just a handful of years ago and now it all seems to be unraveling at the seams.¬† They are angry, they are nervous and they have abandoned caution out of their growing feeling that desperate times call for desperate measures. They are now committed. There is no going back into the shadows. This is a very good thing for our side.

        The biggest thing the 2nd Amendment guys did right is that they never allowed 2nd Amendment advocacy to become toxic.  There really isn‚Äôt the kind of stigma around 2nd Amendment advocacy that exists around immigration or OK to be white and other things we are interested in.  It‚Äôs not really that we aren‚Äôt good advocates, it‚Äôs that what are advocating is worse then cannibalism to the general population.  If we ever got into a public spat with either cannibals or pedophiles, even normal conservatives would back the pedos and cannibals over us.Just before transmania broke out, there was a spate of articles advocating for pedophiles or as they called them, ‚Äúvirtuous pedophiles‚Äù in a bunch of fairly mainstream websites like HuffPo.  What stopped it really wasn‚Äôt public opposition, it was transmania.  The freaks and degenerates got the memo and stopped running the pedo stuff and instead started writing sympathetic articles about tranny children. Had it continued, they would have labelled the opposition as white supremacists and neo-nazis ready to kill the virtuous pedophiles.Until this public revulsion is reversed, it‚Äôs going to be impossible to advocate for our beliefs.

        Talk to any criminal or drug addict or other people who do really dumb things and they will near universally say they have no idea why they did what they did.  The only explanation is that they did what they wanted to do because they wanted to do it and they did not reason themselves into doing it or if they did, only tangentially ie.. I needed money and that is why I did the home invasion on the elderly couple.

        Sorry to hog your forum, Z ‚Äì but I need to comment on (and ask questions) about your Virginia/gun segment.I am of the exact same mind as you on that ‚Äì I think that the gunnies could be a huge addition to your DR team and I believe I said so in your last post about it. Almost all of those guys are well over half way to our side. Almost all of them know that blacks are overwhelmingly responsible for violent gun crime, but are afraid to say so or notice. They are easy pickings for you. But I also noticed the same thing you did when I broached the idea ‚Äì the dissidents were not happy with the gunnies saying they aren‚Äôt up to speed enough on this or that DR pet issue ‚Äì and therefore of little use. And yes, some of it was virtue signalling. In some cases, some of the responders gave me the impression that they thought they were big wheels in the DR movement ‚Äì and were afraid that larger numbers would make for more competition for them‚Ä¶ and that they would lose their place as big fish in a small pond. I sensed some petty motivations there ‚Äì but admit I could be wrong.Regardless ‚Äì is that a valid sentiment? I love the gunnies‚Ä¶ but if we swung them over to us, do you think they could take over the movement? Would that be a good thing or a bad thing? Bigger numbers mean more competition for the leaders of the DR and to be honest ‚Äì I have grown quite fond of some of them. And though I love the gunnies and consider myself to be one ‚Äì there are some toxic cucks and shitlibs in their ranks that I personally feel are liabilities more than assets. Could the dissidents police the usurpers and hijackers in that situation?

            I think that we simply need to view it as coalitions. I was a bit harsh on the gunnies the other day, but they could be a great ally. They want to protect the 2A. We want to protect the 2A. I‚Äôm sure most of them are for keeping what little Free Association we still have, as are we.But we can‚Äôt forget what we really want ‚Äì a white community. However, that scares most whites so it‚Äôs best to keep it under wraps though never forgotten. When I speak with color-blind CivNats ‚Äì and a big chunk of 2A guys fall into that camp ‚Äì I don‚Äôt bring up my desire for a community of our own. But I do bring up that while they may be color-blind, the other side isn‚Äôt. I say that all I want for whites is what every other group has, to not be discriminated against and the right advocate for their group‚Äôs rights.Most CivNats can get behind that even if their worldview is still stuck in 1985, i.e. they don‚Äôt really understand why whites would need to fight for our right or even think as a group.That‚Äôs how you appeal to middle-class whites. You don‚Äôt promote a white community. You push for whites to have the same rights as every other group. It appeals to their fairness and when the cat lady argues back that whites shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to do what other groups do, it makes her sound anti-white, which then makes Joe Normie realize that maybe I‚Äôm right.

                2A people want personal agency (control over their own lives).  So does our community.  It‚Äôs a natural fit, once everyone understands what personal agency is and means.
The CivNats want personal agency too, but they are cowed out of speaking up for it, and figure that voting for the right person is enough.

A CivNat is someone who believes in the Magic Dirt theory, i.e. that our traditions and laws will turn anyone in the world into a white guy. As such, a CivNat gives their allegiance to our civic traditions rather than to his race or ethnicity, conveniently forgetting that our civic traditions grow from our biology.

                    Here‚Äôs my public pitch to Joe Normie. Anything in parentheses is not for public ears.‚ÄúLook, whether we like it or not ‚Äì personally, I don‚Äôt but you may disagree (this lets those on our side know that I might be on our side as well, but don‚Äôt say this in too large a group) ‚Äì the country is moving toward being multi-racial. Your kids will be a minority when they reach our age. (This always freaks people out and wakes them up.)Whites will be just another racial group. Now, I don‚Äôt like to think in racial terms (white lies are permitted), but other groups do. Most blacks see themselves first as black and second as American. The same is true for most Asians and Indians and Hispanics. Heck, Jews love to say that the first question that they ask about anything happening is ‚ÄúIs it good for the Jews?‚Äù (This shocks most whites, btw.)I‚Äôm just saying that as whites become a minority (hammer that point), we‚Äôre going to have to do what all minority groups do, which is to protect our rights. I‚Äôm just saying that whites should have the right to act like other groups. I mean, blacks have the NAACP. Hispanics have La Raza, which means ‚ÄúThe Race‚Äù by the way. Jews have tons of political organizations. Whites don‚Äôt have a political group looking our for our rights.There are business and student associations for every group under the sun, but not whites.I‚Äôm just saying that white should be treated like other groups.We should have European American student associations. European American business groups. European America political groups. Heck, maybe even a European America caucus in the state legislature and Congress. I mean, why not. Every other group has those things. Why not us?I just think whites should be treated like every other group. That seems fair.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs my pitch. It gets us a very long way toward our final goal, and it doesn‚Äôt make Joe Normie feel as though he‚Äôs a racist.And if anyone does bring call you a racist, just keep your cool and say, ‚ÄúHow does wanting whites to be treated like other groups make someone a racist. If blacks weren‚Äôt allowed to have student groups or political groups, I‚Äôd be fighting for their rights too. Why do you want whites to be treated as 2nd class citizens?‚Äù

                That‚Äôs why I see it as a coalition. They aren‚Äôt members of the DR, but we could work together on the one issue.But I agree, the vast majority are colorblind, ‚Äòmerica‚Äôs the greatest CivNats to the core. And since they‚Äôve fully swallowed the propaganda, they believe that what makes the United States so great is immigration and diversity. Therefore, they can‚Äôt be trusted outside of 2A issues.However, I do believe that as the anti-white rhetoric and policies gets worse, many more whites will start to find their way to our side. And my guess is that 2A guys will find it faster than other whites.

                I personally think you are behind the curve on that one Lineman. I used to be in that boat myself ‚Äì and I made the transition long ago. There is a lot of Bad Think going on with the gunnies and it‚Äôs picking up steam. The coalition idea appeals to me ‚Äì because I personally really like the idea of Our Guys remaining in positions where they remain our guys and not say, cucked gunnies.

            My take is that well more than half of the 2A types are not resistant to race realism regarding ‚ÄúPOCs‚Äù. Especially because many are working guys who deal with the average POC. (The wealthier/credentialed progs often deal only with the ‚Äúsmart fraction‚Äù ‚Äî for values of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù ‚Äî and have a skewed view of things due to non-representative sampling.)The issue many 2A types seem to have is not the ‚ÄúBQ‚Äù but the JQ. Lineman and I both frequent a few places where commenters who sound like decent, mostly sensible folk will NOT visit the Z-blog because of ‚Äúall the anti-Semitism‚Äù.

        Peaking at #27 in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, ‚ÄúSaturday Night Special‚Äù featured on Lynyrd Skynyrd‚Äôs first Top 10 album ‚ÄúNuthin‚Äô Fancy‚Äù:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vF66CsYEncMy understanding of the term ‚ÄúSaturday Night Special‚Äù in relation to describing a cheap handgun, comes from something I read from Gary North a number of years back.  He said first the term ‚ÄúN-word Saturday night‚Äù was used to describe what typically happened on Saturday nights in the dark side of town.  Since blacks typically didn‚Äôt have much money ‚Äì cheap handguns were perceived as being designed specifically to be sold to blacks.   So a small , cheap, easily concealable handgun ‚Ä¶ acquired the moniker of ‚ÄúSaturday Night Special‚ÄùIt‚Äôs probably notable that Lyrnyrd Skynyrd is a southern band, and came from a part of the country where the above mentioned dynamic probably existed.

        Florida is important to understanding the modern history of race in America, especially Broward where this Dixie nonsense is going on, though not in the way the DNYUZ article claims. There used to be a solid black middle class in Florida, and blacks had political and economic power there well before anywhere else (island blacks didn‚Äôt have the same history as southern blacks). Two things happened to destroy black people in Florida: The first was desegregation, which first robbed the black businesses of their ‚Äúcaptive market,‚Äù and all-black patronage and secondly broke their communities through bussing and the phony blight scam, which E. Michael Jones talked about happening much further east to White ethnics. The second nail in the coffin was Immigration, especially preferred status/one-foot-in-the-sand laws for Marielitos and later other Hispanics, which finally finished them off. Because entitlements and set-asides are based on skin color rather than being able to establish ancestry, as I think Anne Coulter suggested doing, dark-skinned Cubans and others pretty quickly boxed out American blacks even at the micro- mom &amp; pop level. I sympathize with the normie DR3 types and even the 1.0s like Jared Taylor who keep trying for some kind of black-white coalition or at least truce. But the black political class would need to get Reign of Terror‚Äôd along with white democrats for actual, normal black attitudes on homosexuality, religion in the public sphere, or immigration to ever be relevant.

            Black-White truce?During the Viet Nam War black and white soldiers fought and died side-by-side.

                I didn‚Äôt say or suggest there would be. I said normies and Jared Taylor types still occasionally bring this up. And whites and blacks were not so friendly with each other in Vietnam, or in World War II for that matter (it was covered up, but plenty of black soldiers mutinied).

        Carthago delenda est.  They could never win by force so they honed their abstract art of subversion.  Read the Decline and Fall by Gibbon.  It‚Äôs a long read but you‚Äôll have so many epiphanies, you‚Äôll likely vomit repeatedly in disgust.  If you don‚Äôt have that much patience, Cesar and Christ by Will Durant and Against Apion by our friend Flavius Josephus should suffice.A brief synopsis: they took down Egypt and Rome with their tried and true methods of treachery.  I‚Äôll let the Egyptian historian Manetho tell the story of the invasion by Nomadic shepherds know as the (((Hyksos)))  ‚ÄúThere was a king of ours whose name was Timaus. Under him it came to pass, I know not how, that God was averse to us, and there came, after a surprising manner, men of ignoble birth out of the eastern parts, and had boldness enough to make an expedition into our country, and subdued it by force, yet without our hazarding a battle. So when they had gotten those that governed us under their power, they afterwards burnt down our cities, and demolished our temples of the gods, and used all the inhabitants after a most barbarous manner. Some they slew, and led their children and their wives into slavery. At length they made one of themselves king, whose name was Salatis; he also lived at Memphis, and made both the upper and lower regions pay tribute.Josephus basically says everyone that has written anything slanderous about the Jews and their wicked way‚Äôs did so out of envy.  Victim, victim, blah, blah, blah, but worth the read because it‚Äôs short that‚Äôs painfully familiar in it‚Äôs lack of self awareness.Will Durant lays bare that Rome was usurped by the first semitic emperor Septimius Severus in 193 AD.  Afterward Sun worship was promoted as the preferred religion.  Strikingly similar to the Hyksos implementation of sun worship in Egypt.  It was widely know by ancient historians that after Severus defiled the throne, Rome began it‚Äôs precipitous decline.  His nephew Elagabalus declared a black stone/asteroid the supreme god of the empire and ran backward in a procession in front of this stone pulled in a chariot by 6 white horses.  He routinely dressed as a female and styled himself the empress.  Wikipedia of all places celebrates him as the first transgender figure on record seeking sex reassignment surgery.  What‚Ä¶ the‚Ä¶ absolute fuck with these people.Read history folks, it‚Äôs all there in the stuff written before they regained control.  There‚Äôs a reason classic education has been abandoned.  History has not been a friend to these people for thousands of years.

Sal-Atis = Sal &amp; Attis.  The Hyksos outsider king of Egypt.  Look up Attis on Wiki  ‚ÄúAttis went mad and cut off his genitals‚Äù  Attis Sun god/worship halo? Yeah it‚Äôs all there. Her image should look very familiar.  Our statue of liberty overlooking NY harbor.  Yeah, actually it‚Äôs their castrated transgender god Attis.

                Why stop there.  Every wonder about the abstinence from pork?  Their emasculated god Attis was supposedly killed while out on a hunt by the tusk of a wild boar.  After witch they abstained from all consumption of the detested animal.Remind anyone of game of thrones? Robert Baratheon, the king killed on a hunt for boar ‚Äì Bara-theon basically meaning emasculated-god.  You can‚Äôt make this shit up.  Theon Greyjoy ‚Äì meaning god that does not sow but reaps.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just coincidental that he had his dick chopped off.  Then there‚Äôs Lord Baelish the two faced priest of Baal that owned the brothel.  I‚Äôm sure they get a good chuckle about throwing this shit in our faces.

            Learned something today. Now the reason for there being a ‚ÄúDixie Highway‚Äù in the upper Midwestern state of my birth (said road being near myheimat[1] as it happens) is revealed. Always vaguely wondered, but never enough to look it up. As to ‚ÄúDixie‚Äù itself, I go about Boston with a Stars-and-Bars (NOT the Battle Flag) morale patch on my shoulder bag, partly to see what happens. (So far, not much; I honestly think that none of the usual troublemakers even recognizes it.)

        Do the reasonable usual suspects worry about the visuals in 2020? Schiff, Nadler, and Schumer up front as the officers leading this charge? Seems to me eventually it‚Äôs noticed?Like the name of the lawyer writing the Mueller report that Mueller himself had no idea what it contained?Or the last names of the sexual predators and their trials or their questionable deaths in jail being paraded on national television?The reasonable usual suspects just stroll along pretending not to notice that they are being put up front and center in this cultural war?It‚Äôs front and center on the national stage for all to see now.This cannot be good in the long run.

            Remember that people strut their stuff to show off to their peer group, not the public in general.  IMO the tribe falls deeper into that pattern than most, as the tribe has such importance to many of its members.
There is an infamous photo of Treasury Secretary Mnuchin holding a sheet of dollar bills, with his signature on them, while standing next to his blonde wife.  He is smiling not for us, but for his tribal members, ‚Äúliving the life, baby‚Äù.

        I finally got to listen to today‚Äôs podcast, and figured I‚Äôd add my thoughts on impeachment‚Ä¶Calls for impeachment, of course, have been constant since before Trump was elected, literally, so they were always looking for a reason. Those in the know had to know well in advance that the Russia/Mueller/Weissman operation was a failure, so they would have been looking for the next option long before that final report was released.The Ukraine thing lit every light: There are reports that as much as $7 billion in US aid has gone missing there, and Biden wasn‚Äôt the only one getting part of the vig on those funds (e.g., there are videos of McCain and Graham getting medals from the puppet government we installed there in 2014). Then Trump dared to try to implement his own policies in Ukraine, calling for reconciliation with Russia (boo! hiss!), and trying to fire the US (((ambassador))) there.Then Guliani started poking around there, asking about Ukraine shenanigans during the 2016 election and the Bidens. To quote the State Department bureaucrats behind this, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs actions in Ukraine were contrary to the interagency consensus.‚Äù The whistleblower‚Äôs statement makes clear that he was gathering reports from multiple sources for several months before the now-infamous phone call. They were lying in wait for Trump to do just what he did: mention Biden.The whole thing is bizarre‚Ä¶unless you understand the true underlying issue‚Ä¶

        Regarding the ‚ÄúBest Korea‚Äô broadcasting propaganda from loud speakers I consider the ubiquity of CNN blaring from large screen tv‚Äôs in all kinds of public spaces to be the same thing done for the same purpose. Airports seem especially bad but I‚Äôve noticed it more and more in other public spaces as well. It‚Äôs offensive and repugnant both in the content itself and what it says about how far we have descended down the path from a republic of citizens to an empire of subjects.

            I went to Atlanta a few months back for business and stayed at the Omni Hotel attached to the CNN Center.  It rained most of the nights we were there,  so my coworkers and I walked from the hotel to the CNN Center food court for dinner so that we didn‚Äôt have to go outside in the weather.Obviously they had the CNN feed blaring in the food court.  I had quit watching all of the national cable networks for the most part several years ago and it was jarring how crazy the CNN talking heads were.  Trump had driven them completely around the bend.  It was nothing but propaganda to my ears, but my normie coworkers didn‚Äôt seem to notice.  Frogs being boiled slowly and all that.

            It is absolutely repugnant that we have Israeli citizens (or ANY foreign citizens) as dog catchers let alone Congressmen.  We need to have a change to the Constitution in this regard barring all dual citizens from holding ANY government job whether elected or not.  Foreigners need not apply.  VD added we should ban anyone who is eligible for foreign citizenship from working for the government in any capacity.  I wholeheartedly concur.

                    Lemme adjust my tinfoil beanie here‚Ä¶.Does Iran have a ‚ÄúSamson Option‚Äù?What does author Rod Rosenbaum have to say about it?Israel has been building nuclear weapons for 30 years. The Jews understand what passive and powerless acceptance of doom has meant for them in the past, and they have ensured against it. Masada was not an example to follow‚Äîit hurt the Romans not a whit, but Samson in Gaza? What would serve the Jew-hating world better in repayment for thousands of years of massacres but a Nuclear Winter. [‚Ä¶] The ultimate justice?Are sanctions against Our Greatest Ally an existential threat to that Greatest Ally? Who knows? As the Netherlands-born Israeli military historian (and a very good one indeed) Martin van Creveld says,Let me quote General Moshe Dayan: ‚ÄòIsrael must be like a mad dog, too dangerous to bother.‚Äô [‚Ä¶] We have the [nuclear] capability to take the world down with us.

        Re: ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù.If you look online one of the first hits you‚Äôre going to find is the Wiki page ‚Äì which falls back on the ‚Äúdrawing from federal and state law definitions‚Äù  excuse ‚Äì to call an assault weapon ‚Äúprimarily to semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns that are able to accept detachable magazines and possess one or more other features‚ÄùThe problem with this is ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty much in direct contradiction to the military definition of what an ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù is,  which I‚Äôve seen explained as a FULL automatic weapon in a smaller caliber ‚Äì that is used en-masse by troops who are assaulting a enemy position ‚Äì and which allows them to lay down a large amount of suppressing fire.‚ÄúAssault weapons‚Äù in the military sense derive from the WW2 experience ‚Äì the Russian front more specifically.  The AK-47 (in 7.62√ó39 ‚Äì a smaller caliber than the standard Russian rifle caliber at the time which was 7.62√ó54) was the brainchild of Mikhail Kalashnikov ‚Äì who served during the war.   The Germans also had an ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù derived from the Russian front experience ‚Äì the Stg 44.  The Stg 44 used the 7.92√ó33 cartridge which was smaller than the standard 8mm.Smaller cartridge size = lighter = you carry more.  Fully automatic means you‚Äôre more likely to hit something ‚Äì or keep the enemies heads down when you‚Äôre ‚Äúassaulting‚Äù them.The reality of civilian rifles like the AR-15, AK-47, and yes the Stg 44 (there are semi-auto versions being produced) ‚Äì is that they‚Äôre no different than a wooden stocked rifle with blued metal ‚Äì that shoots the same cartridge.Calling civilian semi-auto rifles ‚Äúassault rifles‚Äù is a leftist word trick that got played so that they can equate these rifles with ‚Äúweapons of war‚Äù, and thereby get political points in their quest for gun control.I mean seriously ‚Äì what weapon ISN‚ÄôT an ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù ?    A baseball bat is an ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù if you start hitting somebody with it.That‚Äôs why I have to fall back on the military definition ‚Äì and ignore the politically inspired ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù use of the ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù moniker.None of this however has stopped the gun rights crowd from exhibiting some cuck behavior and coming up with the ‚Äúmodern sporting rifle‚Äù term.  Police now use the term ‚Äúpatrol rifle‚Äù ‚Äì for the exact same firearm.Personally I just get sick and tired of the word games after a while and just call it a phucking gun.

            You got it exactly right; assault weapon = fully automatic, powered down rifle, so you can control it on full auto and carry more rounds. It basically falls between the submachine gun or machine pistol and the fully automatic rifle/light machine gun, eg BAR, in power and turned out to be the right balance of range, fire rate and power for most infantry situations.
Of course, this also means that civilian ARs are NOT assault weapons, just semi-automatic rifles and, as rifles go, not particularly powerful either.

        If I could ever learn to pronounce ‚Äúmy√∂t√§h√§pe√§‚Äù correctly, it would be a great companion work to ‚Äúschadenfreude.‚Äù The former makes you feel embarrassment, while the latter provides a feeling of pleasure.Neither word works for me in this case, however, since the thought that comes to mind when I hear Schiff, Nadler, &amp; Co., drone on is, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be f**king kidding me. Do you really think I can‚Äôt see through your bulls**t?‚ÄùSadly, as others have noted, masses of Americans are lapping this stuff up. Last night I was out for walk (in my thoroughly sh*tLib neighborhood), and as it got dark I walked by a house with the TV on in the front room. There was a young man (35-45?) dutifully staring at a big screen, soaking in the nonsense coming from one of the PoC House managers. All I could think was, ‚Äúdear God, my man, save yourself!

                I‚Äôve always thought that our current predicament was more like Brave New World than 1984, but it has dawned on me that it‚Äôs much more complicated.
The globalists did not use Brave New World or 1984 as a manual, they raided ALL the dystopian novels for ideas: 1984, Animal Farm, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, Planet of the Apes, A Clockwork Orange, Lord of the Flies‚Ä¶

                    I would say two of the features of our ruling class not predicted in any of these stories are:1) Misdirection ‚Äî This Impeachment melodrama is a classic example. It is being promoted as the MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER, but in reality it is what Trump is being forced to do while the masses are distracted that is important.2) Distribution of Power ‚Äî The classic example of this is how censorship has been turned over to corporations (social media, ISP, payment processing, etc., companies). This seems like an adaptation rather than a well thought out plan, but either way it is becoming more effective every day. And don‚Äôt forget the role of the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù gatekeepers

Straight out of 1984: Trump is Emmanuel Goldstein, we‚Äôve always been at war with Eastasia, production of razorblades has gone up etc.
Number 2 is a good point. I figure Philip K. Dick merits an honourable mention for Ubik and, with the opiod epidemic in mind, A Scanner Darkly.

                            Yeah, you might be right. I think of Goldstein as primarily the signal for where your anger, hate and disappointment should go, but that also implies covering up the sins of the state.

        What‚Äôs missing from the discussion about the success of the 2A crowd in creating a big tent are suggestions about what issue the DR can use to get the normies, civ-nats, and the more sane progressives to lend their ear.  The second amendment, Brexit, and Christian baptism are broad, fairly black and white issues.   There are strong, relatively uncontroversial arguments for signing on to all three.  What‚Äôs the issue around which we‚Äôll coalesce?  Which one is vanilla-enough to draw in the skittish, but which contains doorways to a more dissident outlook?  I imagine it will have to orbit around the concept of labor/jobs but I‚Äôm struggling to come up with specifics.

            IMO it is that when they notice that everyone tribes up but us, everyone has organizations that push their agenda but us, everyone blames us for what is wrong in the world, and then one of us points out to them, probably one-on-one, perhaps on-line rather than face-to-face, that we are just like them, with the same questions and concerns, but that we see a thing that they don‚Äôt, that the answer is right in front of us.  The answer is attitude, understanding, and a kind of enlightenment.  This stuff is only shared with people who ‚Äúget it‚Äù, but ‚Äúgetting it‚Äù opens up a whole new understanding and insight.  We look for opportunities to gently share what we know, and let the light bulb go off.  It‚Äôs small, but it is a start, and it is where we are at right now.

        I was really lucky in the privacy area.  I got burned early on by FB. I ran into someone I went to HS with and we exchanged emails and I accepted him as a friend on FB.  My nieces and nephews were also my friends and so my ‚Äúfriends&#x27;‚Äù posts started showing up their FB pages and of course, it was pictures of them smoking pot and other stupid things.  I deleted the account which didn‚Äôt have any pics anyway.Before FB, I was really paranoid about that sort of thing and then that early FB thing reinforced my paranoia.  There is not a single picture of me on social media. I have no presence at all on the Internet.  Luckily, I share a full name with a famous person from another country and so searching my name brings him up and not me.  The only thing I could find on me was a white pages telephone number and probable relatives.

        Really good show, I agree that we need to learn to organize and to learn to ‚Äòget the message out‚Äô, also if that means overlooking a few minor things we might not agree with. I was personally put a bit off by all the attention the AR toting black guys got. That said I actually think blacks have a right to be in the US, I think they are part of ‚Äòhistorical America‚Äô. They shouldn‚Äôt be in charge, for obvious reasons but they‚Äôve been there (Im currently in Europe) since forever. Learning organizing from the NRA is a good idea. Working w the NRA is another good idea I think (it sounds like they are not going to be interested in talking demographic replacement which I think should be our big thing but, hey, I support the NRA‚Äôs basic idea anyway so no harm there).We should also learn from the Left. They ARE better at organizing. There‚Äôs no shame in learning from the enemy; the British learned from the Boers, hence why Brit spec ops in WWII were called ‚Äòcommandos‚Äô, the Germans learned tanks from the Brits in WWI, then Patton gulped down Rommel and Guderian‚Äôs books so he could tear them a new one in France. Stealing weapons and gear from the enemy is sound tactics, stealing tactics from him is even better.That whole HR, ‚ÄòIm being bullied‚Äô stuff, well that is EXACTLY a low-testo, feminized society in action. Throw out all that cr*p. And bring back dueling.And for the record I think horses make a lot more sense in congress than crazy Somali females and their sh*t tests. At least horses can be relied upon not to make any new, insane laws. And under any originalist reading of the constitution, horses and Somali hysterics are exactly equally eligible to be there.

            Whoever were citizens of the US pre-1965 and their descendants are who should be here. Keep it simple. Even if immigration crept up a bit, having the country hovering north of 80% white is good enough for me. That said, we aren‚Äôt going back to 1965 demographics. So to build on what Z said, we need to think of ourselves as a white bloc not an ethno-state. We can be a large interest group or a political party, or both. Like Sinn Fein was for the Irish Catholics. (But less sketchy and Marxist, obvs.) Leftists have power &amp; influence because they have a political party and much of the media. We do not.That‚Äôs why I am friendly to the idea of remaking the Republican Party to consciously serve legacy American interests. Otherwise we have to build a political organization from the ground up and hope to hell that a few rich guys come to our side. I don‚Äôt like our odds there.

                Yeah that makes sense. 1965 was when demographics was weaponized in politics. It may be the most momentous year in US history and certainly since the civil war.
I also think a hostile takeover of the GOP is a good idea, if possible. Trump is basically half-way there, both on positions and in actually taking over the GOP. Maybe us demographically awares should work w Trump style civnats. Eventually a lot of them will join us anyway. Im one example of that so Im not exactly holier than thou.

        Z‚ÄîGreat analysis. Will listen to your podcast later. I‚Äôm deeply burned out watching the crazy bug eyed lunatic and other crazy drunk stroked-out ruling overlords. Every time I ruefully wish all the senile old ruling farts to be lifted off the planet, I shudder knowing the AOCs and young Commie Socialists will take over. Trapped.So for diversion, Sh#ts and Grins, this ought to be a fun movie reminding us to saddle up and not be crying in our beer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYK4LoJ_ENkThe Avenging Angel.  Yes‚Ä¶.Brigham Young‚Äôs avenging angels. They had stones, often nutty, sometimes dangerous, but stones none the less.  In Kurt Schlichter‚Äôs People‚Äôs Republic, you don‚Äôt want to cross Mormon ranchers.Escape present reality into this movie with Tom Berenger, Charlton Heston and James Coburn, especially with Charlton Heston as Brigham Young!  Ha!  Damn‚Ä¶.maybe would have volunteered to be one of his wives..for the moment. If he pontificated and banged on the dining table exhorting God, well then time to join the mining rush to the White Pines and Hamilton City.  (Old Brigham had a handful of his 55 wives divorce him, one when he was 67 and she was 24. Probably mostly talked her to death. And banged on the table‚Ä¶.Feh!)As soon as Basic Husband returns from traipsing around looking for fossils in Permian limestone, we shall have a hoot of an evening enjoying this movie.Just wish that most urban Mormons didn‚Äôt act like Charlie Kirk instead of Tom Berenger.

        I also think that Rep. Schiff believes every word he says. His career  took off with this ‚ÄúFrom 1987 to 1993, he was an Assistant United States Attorney in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Central District of California.[6] While in this position, Schiff came to public attention when he prosecuted the case against Richard Miller, a former FBI agent who was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union.[7] The first trial resulted in a hung jury; the second trial resulted in a conviction that was overturned on appeal.[8] Miller was convicted in a third trial.[9]‚ÄùThis success maybe the reason of his apparent obsession with Russian/Soviet spying (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff).If it was true 85 years ago that Vishinsky was the Roland Freisler of the Nazis, then Schiff is our modern day Vishinsky, similar political views and simlar prosecutorial methods, see,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Vyshinsky.
