        The great ship USS America was holed three times, 1913, 1920, and 1965. By now even the productive class is incapable of acting in their own interest or knowing what that is. The democratic tyranny is not one of an odious king, who does not care what you think. The democratic tyranny needs to be inside your mind, and it is.
The productive class cannot advance and will only shrink until the end of this form of rule, as if there is an end. The only American future that could actually  be expected  is Brazilian, and that is being optimistic.

        Severian: If I could put just two checks on the bankers, it would be to prevent them from consolidating the mortgage assets pool across all 50 states and to force banks to chose between equities and real assets… one or the other but not both. That severely limits their power and prevents about 90% of the excesses.  I know that is essentially Glass-Steagall, but it worked before and I think it would work again.I’m always stumped by the European insistance that American culture is a “young” culture.   Did Captain John Smith land at Jamestown, sow dragon’s teeth, and up popped Americans?What we really are is a small-c creole culture. Just as when you take a bunch of people who speak different languages together and force them to cooperate, they first synthesize a pidgin to communicate, which then evolves into a creole, so we have evolved.

            I’d certainly give it a try!  Regulations have to be simple to work — in a battle between politicians, many of whom have never held a day job, and guys who went to school for years in order to understand an insanely complex, arcane subject like finance, who do you really think is gonna win?  You can’t make it idiot proof — witness our Supreme Court’s gyrations on Obamacare and gay “marriage” — but at least when that happens, you know who to blame, as “not a tax” is “it’s a tax” only in the twisted mind of John Roberts.

        I don’t see how shifting wealth and power from business leaders to political leaders solves the problem of concentration of wealth and power. This looks like plain looting to me.
In fact, maybe that’s the difference this time: it’s the concentration of political power in a small, insular elite which needs to be fixed. Break up the Government Trust.

        Karl, America culture and institutions have had 400 years to evolve on this continent and thousands of years before in England. It’s been 240 years since the grown ups got divorced not since when the baby was born. Is culture east of the Oder younger than culture on the Rhine? Is Scandanavian culture older German? Or just the settlements? And while America has had hundreds of years experience with Democracy and having our petty states united, Germany has decades of experience with either and the effects it has on culture and it shows. maybe wagen das finger less no?

            I wouldn’t count 400-years since you weren’t actually “America” until after your independence from England. Up until then, you were all English citizens under the crown except for those west of the Mississippi who were either under French or Spanish rule. So you only get credit for being American since you became “Americans”, in 1776. However, it doesn’t take anything away from the benefits you enjoyed from European influence prior to 1776.
The Germanic tribes were here long before the Romans crossed the Alps, so we consider ourselves as ethnic Germans going well back 2,000 years.

        “Concentrations of wealth are the great threat to republican government so the logical response to it is to break up the large interests.”  Or to co-opt them.  Over at our group blog, our Four Regular Readers have gotten so tired of me harping on Fascism that I just call it (((SexyFunTime))) now… but it’s the truth, and it needs to be said.  If you can’t stop picturing a ranting fellow with a funny mustache, think of Japan’s version of thekokutai,1926-1945.  A guaranteed minimum standard of living, internal and external security, and above all a sense of national purpose for all the superfluous young men left behind by Modernity… itworks.It’s far easier to keep Goldman-Sachs and Citibank on the leash with “treason to the national community” than with another iteration of Glass-Steagall or whatever other suite of “regulations” we have to pass to find out what’s in them (and that liberals can’t be bothered to understand anyway).  Nb. to aspies: I am NOT advocating Fascism.  I think it’s horrible.  But I also think it’s inevitable (either that, or civil war to the knife, followed by genocide of the losers).

            America has been mildly fascist since the 30’s. We don’t use the term because it carries baggage we really don’t like and really does not fit. American corporatism is different in nature form the European experiments, but there is a lot of overlap. The coordination between banking, business and politics is something Mussolini would instantly recognize. What’s not included in the America version is the labor component.
I think we may be headed for a slow peeling back of the 20th century American corporatism. That means bringing finance to heel and breaking up the big tech players.

                ZMan, I’m surprised to hear you parrotting the current misguided trope that America is “fascist”. It’s patently absurd. The fashionable jumping off point for this point of view is Mussolini’s alleged quote: “Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power.” Unfortunately, Mussolini never actually said this (Good analysis at this link:http://www.publiceye.org/fascist/corporatism.html). Fascism has nothing to do with Corporatism; and furthermore, the legal groundwork for modern American corporatism was largely laid down between 1865 and 1910– long before 20th century fascism was established or even conceived. I strongly suggest you read Ted Nace’s “Gangs of America”, it is an invaluable resource on the relentless rise of corporate power over the last 150 years. As an aside, you cited the “trust busting” efforts of the early 20th century and implied they amounted to a meaningful reform; the fact is, they didn’t effectively amount to anything as corporate interests quickly and quietly moved in different directions. The real “reform” happened completely under the radar, and was in fact inimical to public interest.But not only are modern publicly-traded corporations not fascist, a strong case can be made that they are in fact communist institutions. These are large international institutions, nominally owned by hundreds of thousands of people who have no effective say in their governance, and who receive virtually no ongoing benefit due to the virtual elimination of dividends in favor of “capital growth”, and commanded by an unaccountable international executive elite who are highly compensated via stock option schemes and gigantic salaries. Or, put another way, the workers own the means of production, which is managed allegedly for their benefit by a carefully indoctrinated elite class who skim off most of the value for themselves. Sounds like communism, frankly.Going in a different direction, consider that the opening of the Soviet archives in the early 1990s proved conclusively that the FDR and Truman administrations were riddled with Communist agents…and when Joe McCarthy made an honest attempt to uncover these facts, he was vilified and hounded out of office and into an early grave. By the early 1960s, after only a few decades  of effort, virtually every plank and goal of the communist party had been instituted to some degree by the Federal Government. (http://veritasetparatus.blogspot.com/2008/11/tenets-of-communism.html)That so many people have the idea that the USA is even remotely “fascist” is a testament to how well the “progressive” Cultural Marxist propaganda machine has done its job.

                Yeah, Hitler spent a lot of time crushing organized labor, and America has always been way more “capitalist” than our friends across the pond.  But the New Deal was unquestionably Fascist….unless, as so many people these days seem to, you think Fascism absolutely requires armbands and Party rallies and invading Poland.  But the armbands-and-rallies stuff is coming.  Americans won’t openly embrace “racism,” but the only defense against identity politics is identity politics, and when the federal bennies spigot gets dialed back a notch, all the other groups are going to ruthlessly go after theirs…. whites are going to have to, and the Left has shown us how easy it is to achieve “coordination” (gleichschaltung,for the pedants) without any overt police-state antics.  That’s the part of Fascism I want to emphasize — the cultural stuff.  Given Social Security, and the fact that Prudential wrote Obamacare, we’d hardly need to change a paragraph in the law to get to the economic version.  How many young American men do you think would join the Brownshirtsright nowif they called themselves something other than “Brownshirts”?  Culture precedes economics.

                        Economically, Fascism is a partnership of big business and government, where big business is the junior partner.  Agriculture subsidies, price controls, wage controls, all designed to artificially boost employment past what the market would bear under normal conditions.  Massive public works projects from the WPA and youth make-work projects like the Civilian Conservation Corps are the equivalent of rearmament (Germany actually overheated its economy in the mid-30s, as rearmament caused massive labor shortages (increasing your army from the Versailles-mandated 100,000 to 2+ million will do that)).  Then there’s social insurance (Social Security), and let’s not forget the propaganda and FDR’s attempt to pack the Supreme Court… a good rule of thumb is, if you can’t tell where the government ends and the large conglomerates begin, it’s (economic) Fascism.

                                His first sentence is not incorrect. FDR and his progs openly embraced the European fascist until Adolf ruined their crush. For years I’ve heard main line American progs at the NYT lament that they don’t have the power to, well, dictate that the boys in China do. Of course The One proved them wrong about that, not that they will notice until Trump does it.

                                    Really? Frankly, you could make a much better argument that FDR openly embraced communism. Take a look at the communist party planks, then take a look at the New Deal. FDR’s administration was riddled with communist agents; we know this as a fact ever since the soviet archives were opened in the early 90s. If FDR was a fascist, why did he side with the communists during WW2? Both Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland in September 1939, yet Britain and France–who were obligated by treaty to declare war on BOTH invading parties– only declared war on Germany… and the US was happy to follow suit. And despite Lenin and Stalin killing tens of millions of people during the 1920s and 1930s, one of the first things that FDR did upon assuming office was to formally recognize the Soviet Union.FDR was a communist, not a fascist. There really isn’t any other way to interpret the facts.

                                        Mussolini was a huge fan of FDR. Malcolm Crowley, an intellectual giant in New Deal liberalism wrote glowingly of Mussolini. The American Left was so smitten with Il Duce that Hollywood was negotiating with his son on a movie about him. Then you know who came along and fascism became a dirty word.

        If the West is to free itself from the clutches of the plutocracy, reform of national monetary systems, sovereign debt issuance and management, anything and everything that wrests control from the charlatanry of finance capitalism and the ledger-book prestidigitators who profit from “lending” funds they create from nothing will be the first order of the day for any nationalist political party worthy of the name. The danger, of course, is that by putting monetary matters into the hands of politicians in “democracies” that degenerate into ochlocracies, citizens must ensure that strict limits are placed upon monetary inflation meant to pacify voters. At this stage of the game, I’d be willing to take that chance.

        While Europeans have had literally thousands of years to evolve and develop into what we are today, Americans have manged to compress all that they have become into less than 250 years. While that is impressive, it has its price.Is it any wonder that American cultural, social and economic systems are under a constant state of stress? In less than a single generation (say two decades), morals, traditions and values are imposed and discarded so quickly, before one has the chance to deal with one change, something new comes along.That’s not to say the rate and frequency of change won’t happen here as it does there…it would seem the rate of change is increasing everywhere. And not for the better.

            “In less than a single generation (say two decades), morals, traditions and values are imposed and discarded so quickly, before one has the chance to deal with one change, something new comes along.”Karl, I’d suggest that that analysis applies just as well to Germany as it does the United States. Your society has been thoroughly ripped apart by leftism and nihilism in the last 50 years. From where I sit, Germany has abandoned its heritage and embraced a Godless culture of death and is committing suicide right before our eyes. At least we here in America have 250 years of experience in pushing back frontiers and adapting to continuously changing internal conditions. And we have two oceans between us and the rest of the world. Frankly I like our chances a little better than yours.

                @ BB – Absolutely correct. While we in Europe struggle with the Islamic issue, you Americans will continue to struggle with the south of the border issue. Unfortunately, our political elites see things the same way – and ignore common sense and good judgment at nearly an identical level.

        After reading Reform Week part 1,  For some reason I felt inclined to  thumb through a little of  Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and and Durant’s Story Civilization.
We might be ready for another reformation (and of course, all it’s unintended consequences.)   unless perhaps we’re living in the last days of civilization. Not only do we have the barbarians at the gates, which are wide open, we also have then in the universities and schools throughout the land.
It was good while it lasted.
