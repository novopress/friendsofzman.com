        I once worked with a guy originally from Argentina, who had left to avoid Pinochet’s draft, went to Italy, got a job with a multinational service provider, and as such spent the next twenty years working as a service tech in a variety of south and central american $hithole$. He defined corruption to me as “when you can’t even figure out who to bribe”.

        And I forgot.  If you want to study what Africa could look like, look at the outlier, Botswana.  In the 80’s, I had the opportunity to meet asettlerwho was an officer in their Army.  In addition to having a great deal of tolerance, they have done some very smart things with regards to AIDS and crime.

        I often wonder if Europe circa 1200 AD was pretty much the same as Africa in term of intelligence.  I also wonder if the waves of certain diseases and war didn’t significantly raise intelligence.  Take syphilis for example.  We know that self control and intelligence are highly correlated.  Therefore, anyone who couldn’t keep his hose knotted or fly buttoned was much more likely to get the pox, infect his wife, and if he and she lived long enough, crank out a couple of short-lived, infected pups.  The men who were smart enough to stay away from the fleshpots lived and reproduced.  The duller men with less self-control, not so much.The whole Chinese fetish with shoes is probably similar.  Your Asian tiger moms who would would scratch dad’s eyes out if he brought his shit-covered shoes inside the hut, probably increased the odds of survival of her kids substantially.
