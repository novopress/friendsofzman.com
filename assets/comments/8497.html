        The second verse of the Horace Smith version of Ozymandias comes to mind-
We wonder,‚Äîand some Hunter may expressWonder like ours, when thro‚Äô the wildernessWhere London stood, holding the Wolf in chace,He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guessWhat powerful but unrecorded raceOnce dwelt in that annihilated place.

        I was just in Ireland back in May of this year and felt fortunate to have enjoyed two weeks of nearly perfect weather. The Irish are amazing people; friendly, hospitable and very open. Though it doesn‚Äôt take much to verify they have a national drinking and gambling problem (no thanks to Guinness and church bingo). A round trip from Dublin, Sligo, Castlebar, Galway, Limerick, Killarney, Cork and back to Dublin gives one a good perspective of the land and the people, especially if you avoid the major cities and highways and make a point to stay on the back-roads and drive through the smaller towns along the way. If you‚Äôre a hiker, I think you‚Äôll enjoy the north-west more than the south-west. The area around Killarney is a bit over rated in my opinion. But if you follow the signs for the Wild Atlantic Way you won‚Äôt be disappointed.Since you‚Äôre in Dublin, you‚Äôre close enough to two very unique landmarks in Ireland; Trim Castle ‚Äì which is the largest Norman castle in Ireland and the ancient burial grounds at Bru na Boinne. Both are about an hours drive from Dublin and well worth a visit.If you spend any time traveling around Ireland you‚Äôll start to notice the number of abandoned and/or ruined churches, abbeys and farm houses. These are unique, yet unspoken features of Ireland, and you won‚Äôt see anything like it anywhere else in Europe. Irelands greatest export for the past 200-years has been themselves, thus the number of abandoned and ruined structures scattered across the landscape and the fact their country is twice the size of Switzerland with half the population.If you make it down to Cork, avoid kissing the Blarney Stone in Blarney Castle as is the popular tourist event. The local boys are known to sneak in at night and piss on it! Just saying. üòâ

            The ruined and abandoned churches didn‚Äôt happen from neglect.  Under Henry VIII in the 1530s and under Cromwell in the 1650s, they were deliberately destroyed and Catholicism was outlawed.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlkik/ihm/ire1600.htm

                @ Alcogito ‚Äì True. But still, many have fallen into neglect as Irish populations moved away over the past 200-years. Here in Germany, people have just stopped attending church. At one point, the church was selling them for 1-Euro to get them off the books. You can still find them on various German real estate websites, even eBay.

            I saw the deserted churches and farmhouses in rural SW England in 2004. Realtors were trying to sell the churches as houses. I saw a lot of depopulated rural areas in South Korea in 2009 and we all know areas in the US that are in decline. In the NY State North Country in 1991, the local newspaper took three days in eight point font to print all of the county-repossessed properties.
Even my intelligent/intuitive liberal kook friends know that something is very wrong. Unlike the proprietor and commentators on this blog, they are just in denial.

        ‚ÄúOne of those cab drivers said a funny thing to me. He was pointing out a section that caters to students, when he said it is the one thing he dislikes about driving a taxi. He has to witness the debauchery of the young. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if they have no respect for themselves, particularly the men. They treat women like whores. How could they ever marry one of them?‚Äù‚Äù
Interesting. I was in a cab last year in South Bend, Indiana, and the driver said almost the exact same thing about the Notre Dame and St. Mary‚Äôs College students.

        As an Englishman, I admit I find it hard to keep a straight face about the Irish. I admire their passion, their ability to make the most of a bad hand and above all their innate ability to tell stories like no one else, but they are suffering from a love of the EU. The European Union is not their friend but they haven‚Äôt seen it yet, though the recent attempt by Brussels to squeeze extra money out of a large employer in the shape of Apple may yet hurt Eire more than it likes.But while we on the mainland of the British isles are hoping to get our politicians to accept that the will of the people in voting for Out really does mean that, there is a lingering problem with the Irish border. If anyone in the EU can make its way into Eire and thus have unfettered access to Norn Iron then England, Wales and Scotland will find that any border between us and the muslim-flooded content is pretty much meaningless.Sort of like leaving the back door wide open while the front door is locked.

        What the English couldn‚Äôt accomplish over centuries of trying, consumerism and the EU have managed in two generations: the near-destruction of the Irish cultural character. Once a rural people, the new norm is urban and cosmopolitan. Once unquestioningly Catholic, now decidedly secular. The list goes on and on, but is too depressing to contemplate for a 70 year old who remembers what Ireland and being Irish once were. The Irish abroad will not forget themselves as a people, one hopes, even when they meld by marriage and their children share other ethnicities.

        White people are no longer reproducing for whatever reason. In four generations, the remnants will be exhibited in zoos, like albino rhinos, for the colored peoples to gaze at and wonder how they once ruled the world (always supposing that homo sapien will survive four generations more)..

        The one factor I don‚Äôt see addressed is the diaspora of Irish blood around the globe.  Sure, what you say is true in ‚ÄúIreland‚Äù proper, however, the concept of Irish is still flourishing.  I would say it is a strong cultural representative in the US but I don‚Äôt know about the child birth rates or racial mixing effects.  Maybe this is a case where the ideas of ‚Äúborderless‚Äù culture applies.

            I know very few people who are descended from the Poato Famine generation of migrants who are full ethnic Irish. My great-great grandmother was potato famine era. I think it would be extremely rare to not intermarry after 5 generations (and 15? child-producing unions) in cities that were teeming with non-Irish people. The white Americans who are not European mutts seem to be from rural areas (much Appalachia is still very culturally similar to the British Isles) or part of religious groups that make exogamy hard (Jews, Mennonites, etc. and even they lose some every generation).

        The Claremont link posted by elbaboso is well worth reading. It‚Äôs by someone who wrote earlier in the year under a pseudonym for ‚ÄúThe Journal of American Greatness,‚Äù which shut down a little while back. Nice to read his stuff again.Quote: ‚ÄúOne of the Journal of American Greatness‚Äôs deeper arguments was that only in a corrupt republic, in corrupt times, could a Trump rise. It is therefore puzzling that those most horrified by Trump are the least willing to consider the possibility that the republic is dying.‚ÄùEl baboso‚Ä¶ You live in the NY north country too? Wonderful perspective up here. What happens when the liberals are really in charge for a really long time‚Ä¶Tim

            Tim,
I spent some time up there.   I still remember the ice storm of ‚Äô91 and the wind blowing so hard off the lake in March and April that the rain drops appeared to travel parallel to the ground. Late spring, summer, and fall were glorious, though. Maybe after I win the lottery, I‚Äôll buy a summer house in Sacketts Harbor or the Thousand Islands.

        Another good essay.
The reason for the lack of kids with younger people is the overpopulation caused by the fecundity of earlier generations.  Look up ‚Äúmouse utopia‚Äù to see how animals behave in conditions of overpopulation.  I have one child so that my grandmother and my mother-in-law each could have nine.  The young people in Ireland are living lives of ‚Äúdebauchery‚Äù so that cab-drivers‚Äô parents could have eighteen.  The last time every Irish generation each had eighteen children you got the potato famine.  It evens out.

            I don‚Äôt see how that works. Eighteen children is a bit much today, but food certainly isn‚Äôt a problem today. We Americans can feed the planet, can‚Äôt we, if the government and anti-GMOers leave Monsanto alone? Second, if the millenials eventually have only one child each, doesn‚Äôt that mean that by the third or fourth generation there won‚Äôt be anyone else to mate with? Each generation becomes half as many, right? I didn‚Äôt take time to work it out.

                The planet is fed through the burning of massive amounts of fossil fuels.  I realize red-staters believe that you can burn massive amounts of fossil fuels without any harm to the environment, but at least they are going to run out some day.  Work with me here.  With overpopulation you also get, and this happens throughout history, these massive migrations from poor areas to rich areas, especially as its always the poorer people who have the most children, its often one of the reasons why they are poor.

                    No, we WON‚ÄôT work with you and your ‚ÄúGaia -minded‚Äù propaganda! Its  a shame you haven‚Äôt put  an ounce of research or thought into what you type.  First of all, the fuels aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfossil‚Äù, they are naturally occurring and in all reasonableness, will never run out, as Earth churns out more and more hydrocarbons from within. Second, there is not and never will be ‚Äúoverpopulation‚Äù. Maybe from your tiny perch in the Boston-Wash. DC Corridor, things seem mighty crowded because you can‚Äôt get an easy  reservation for dinner in your favorite bistro, but out West, the spaces are wide open  and unpopulated to the point of desolation.Indeed, the total of Earths population could fit comfortably in just a few big counties in Texas. And feeding that population is not an issue (Granted handling the waste  generated from such concentration could be problematic, unless capitalism is allowed to treat the matter as a profit generating activity.) Frankly, all of the food problems in this world that I‚Äôll wager you ae so concerned with, are caused, not by scarcity of food stuffs, but by poor means of distribution, allocation management and outright political fraud!Come back here when your mind grows up.

                        There‚Äôs plenty of room in Argentina, the world‚Äôs eighth-largest country. If one deducts the populations of the three largest metropolitan areas from the total population, the country‚Äôs population density falls between the more densely populated Mongolia and the less densely populated desert waste of Libya. A nation largely in the temperate zone with significant subterranean water reserves and natural resource abundance, were Argentina to revitalize her railroad infrastructure and dismantle her crippling policy of outdated protectionism, the  country could become a paradise for smallholders and small businesses. Already the ‚Äúwhitest‚Äù South American nation, folks of European ancestry willing to learn Spanish would do well to consider the country as a kind of ‚Äúfinal frontier‚Äù should matters worsen in their declining societies.

                Who says it is ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs‚Äù job to feed the planet?  And why should we leave Monsanto, a chemical behemoth, alone?  Have you read what they have done to corn farming and using their power to buy political clout and legal ‚Äúownership‚Äù of the seed?  Farmers MUST buy their seed from Monsanto or go out of business or face court costs up the yinyang.  Yeah, that‚Äôs the ticket.  Leave Monsanto alone.  We can trust them.  Just like we can trust Hillary.

                    You know there are open source (for lack of a better term) corn varieties available right?You don‚Äôt HAVE to plant Monsanto‚Ñ¢ corn.  The yield may be slightly lower, and you can‚Äôt use Roundup herbicide without killing the corn too, but it‚Äôs possible to grow corn and soybeans without dealing with Monsanto, if you don‚Äôt want to.There‚Äôs a guy up in Iowa who pretty much singlehandedly revolutionized soybean growning, and he kept the technology from being patented by Monsanto or DOW, etc.  He‚Äôs working on hybrid corn varieties that out produce the current patented offerings as well.  The big boys can‚Äôt touch his bean yields, and I suspect he‚Äôll match that performance in maze before he dies (he‚Äôs not super old right now, so he‚Äôs got plenty of time).Spend less time protesting and more time doing productive things, and it‚Äôll all shake out in the end.

                        Yeah right.  Some ‚Äúguy‚Äù is going to fight the legal funds of a powerhouse like Monsanto who has politicians in their pocket.  I would expect a little more discernment from readers on this site and not so much blind faith in the global food industry which is controlled by only a few large corporations.  Like everything these days, their goal is to eliminate competition and governments are only too happy to help them.  They want to own the whole shebang.

                            You misunderstand.  He‚Äôs not fighting Monsanto or DOW over GMO strains that they‚Äôve developed.He‚Äôs made his own strains, unique and in the case of the soybeans, more productive than any strain ever before created.  He patented the strain and then released it to the world a la open source technology.His pre-existing patent prevents the big boys from reverse engineering his creation and patenting it themselves.This isn‚Äôt just some random guy who started working on genetics last week, he‚Äôs been at the soybean thing for twenty five years, and has had that patent for five or ten years now.It‚Äôs legit and easily researchable, and has been in the news (especially the ag journals) several times over the last few years.The point is, that you don‚Äôt have to strip the big boys of their property (which they spent a crapload of money on developing, no doubt) to fight their stranglehold on agriculture.Also, while one or two people have been sued for wind or bee related cross pollination, those suits were dismissed (and rightly so).  The people getting sued for big money are the big farmers who are keeping a percentage of the Monsanto/DOW GMO maze harvest to use as seed for the next season.  Newly made hybrid seeds don‚Äôt propagate as well as traditional maze does when you hold back seed corn from harvest, but it will germinate.  The big guys are saying that 1) own that corn if it is used as seed to produce another harvest and 2) they don‚Äôt want second and third generation seeds taken from their original hybrids being grown and going to market because the product they yield will be of a variable and lower quality overall, which degrades the brand name.Fight back by being more nimble and smarter than the Goliaths of the world.Or, you can see yourself as totally powerless and sit around pissing and moaning about it while allowing the big boys to rule the world.They‚Äôre not beating you, you‚Äôre giving up and going back to bed because it‚Äôs hard.Fuck that noise.  You think you‚Äôre so educated and informed, but what did it get you?  Despair and hopelessness.That‚Äôs super useful.  Let‚Äôs all go out and bitch about big companies while dismissing out of hand the one guy who‚Äôs actually DOING something about the problem.

                                thanks Nunya.  I am not responding out of ‚Äúdespair and hopelessnes‚Äù but rather an attempt to spread the word that few are bothering to cover (our glorious media) and even less are educating themselves about issues like this one.I appreciate your inputs.  I did not know there are efforts going on of an independent nature but as with the Brussels crowd, crony capitalism which has complete government protection and backing, etc. and the legal profession which is paid for by these conglomerates, even these little guys face a daunting challenge.  So go ahead and belittle my rants but at least I will use my little bully pulpit to shout from my little hilltop about things that no one seems to give a shit about.  I am trying to raise some awareness.You seem to be so friendly towards the Monsanto types, why is it you think they are so benevolent to man?  I am not dismissing out of hand the one guy you know of who is doing something.  You are right, I am pissed off.  But I am not allowing the ‚Äúbig boys‚Äù to rule the world, the game is rigged and there is no justice ‚Ä¶ no way to change that even if you think there is a  chance in hell to be competitive.  Your friends patent, ‚Äúcannot be reversed engineered‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ha, man do I have a bridge to sell you if you believe that.  The damn lawyers will figure out a way to let Monsanto do so if they want and blame your friend for letting them.  That‚Äôs just the way the game is done these days.

                    The Monsanto part was mild sarcasm; the point was that the ability to produce food today does not limit any family to one child. As John Tyler pointed out, the Malthusians/Erlichians have always been wrong.

            The first and last cause of childlessness is the same cause as a vast variety of modernity‚Äôs other social ills: female emancipation.The State systematically emancipates daughters from their fathers, while discouraging them from finding husbands, and encouraging them to waste their fertility on non-reproductive sex with an endless series of unattached men. See college.It isn‚Äôt just an accident; it didn‚Äôt ‚Äújust happen‚Äù, it‚Äôs systematic and deliberate. Woman are net tax consumers, meaning that State and State-mandated redistributions of wealth (direct welfare, make-work jobs, etc.) from men to women ENTIRELY fund ‚Äúfemale emancipation‚Äù.No children because no marriages. No marriages because no marriageable women. No marriageable women because no legal marriage.

                I think it‚Äôs worse than that. Modern feminists have convinced women to hate children. If you point out that women have historically loved babies and children, they get all huffy. The Italian government has been trying to convince the women there to have children again. The feminists there say that it smacks of Mussolini to be reminded that they might enjoy having a family.I think it is a shame that  we don‚Äôt widely publicize the unhappy lives of prominent feminists. Kate Millet, Susan Brownmiller, even Gloria Steinham don‚Äôt seem to have had a happy ending. Maybe they were just wrong about what women want.

                    True. They‚Äôve planted an idea in women‚Äôs mind about a baby being something like a parasitic growth inside them, and with child support and the other screwy ‚Äúfamily laws‚Äù they‚Äôve terrified men of ever having children.
Both go back to female emancipation.
Fortunately, the maternal instincts are so strong they can be reliably reactivated with just a bit of encouragement. Unfortunately, women‚Äôs instincts aren‚Äôt getting that encouragement.
