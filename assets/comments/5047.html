        Maybe I’ll sound naive, but what if there really is a God? It would follow that there would also be a Satan. And if the void at the center, where God used to be, were to be replaced by the Evil One, would it not follow that this new religion would be relentlessly evil, and have as its one primary goal the corruption of all?That’s the feeling I get, anyway.

        If we see religion purely as the manifestation of the urge to worship something (if not someone) then socialism and communism and environmentalism and all the rest of the variety of -isms begin to make sense. The need to prostrate oneself before a supposedly superior ideology or even the head of that ideology has never really gone away, no matter how sophisticated we think we are.The love of technology has made this worship more intense: if you can tweet or ‘like’ or blog about how much the rights and beliefs of others intermingle so sweetly with one’s own perceived rights and beliefs then you are wearing your pride for all to see. Being on the left is a public journey to self-assumed glory and seeking of praise for one’s earnest beliefs. Seeking the internal journey is so out-of-date, know what I’m saying’, bro?As the Monkees once sang: “I’m a believer!” And the whole of the left became monkees a long time ago.

        Pretty sure Evagelicals earn salvation through accepting Jesus as their savior. Maybe your formulation of getting right includes that. The works debate is as old as the Reformation.

        Won’t end well? OK, we’re going through a bad patch right now, and we might just have a teensy weensy little major economic collapse on the horizon.  But I’m thinking that could be a _good_ thing.When the EBT cards stop working, we’ll probably see at least 10 million of the riffraff kill each other off in the first 8-10 weeks. Maybe more.A long hard freezing winter, and that’ll sweep off another 10-15 million or so weaklings. Maybe more.No telling how many people will pick up sticks and head their families back south of the border, too. But quite a few, I bet.And boy howdy, talk about a MAJOR attitude adjustment among a majority of the lucky survivors.  Why, this place will practically clean *itself* up!We’ll be _fine_, those of us left –  no worries, mate!

            If/When the EBT cards stop… It’s more complex than you think.  Yes there will be riots and it would be ugly. No, that they’ll just be killing themselves.https://westernrifleshooters.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/bracken-when-the-music-stops-how-americas-cities-may-explode-in-violence/

        The suicide rate among deviants is always much higher than that of the population at large.
The logical next step for the European deviants would be to legalize polygamy so that the mohamedans can boost their birthrates even higher and obliterate Christiandom (just found out that the iOS spell check doesn’t have “Christ” in it but does have Mohamed… make of that what you will) even faster. The logical next step for the American deviants would be to legalize pedophilia to further demoralize religious and civil society and push them closer to their final demise.

        It was pointed out to me a long time ago that the ideological refugees from  Soviet era communism found a soft landing in the environmental movement.  Seems that notion had some merit.

        Don’t leave out the left’s sympathies for Islamic terrorism, particularly the sympathies it had before 9/11 made having said sympathies taboo.
The core of all of this is outright hostility to traditional western civilization. Islam, gay marriage, communism, are just means to that end.
