        After the California wildfires (remember those?) I read an article on a left-leaning think tank about the insurance crisis in California, written by an “insurance industry expert.” I looked through the guy’s bio, and he was maybe in his 30’s, and saw that he graduated from college with a degree in public policy or something like that. He never worked for an insurance company. He wasn’t an actuary so he never priced a policy or managed a book of business. He never was an insurance agent so he never sold a policy. He never even worked for an insurance commission so he never regulated the industry, either.So, really what makes this guy an expert? It really seemed to me that a bunch of people who knew nothing about insurance got together and declared him to be an expert. And this seems to be the managerial way of doing things. Part of the issue is that the real experts – people who, like I said, work in the industry – are treated as hostile by the managerial regime, probably because they have common sense and logical reasons as to why the managerial way of doing things (as best represented by regulators) won’t work.

                    I don’t know exactly when ball caps became fashion accessories for girlbosses who wanna look tough, but when I heard Kristi Noem was going to El Salvador to tour the prison, I knew right then she would be wearing one.

                        I suspect talentless Hollywhore Kathryn Bigelow bears a lot of the blame with her revolting girlboss epic Zero Dark Thirty.
The world seems to be healing, but just a few years ago you could ride the MAGA-crowd around like a pony if you had a stripper with a Stars and Stripes-bikini toting a Barrrett .50 on your posters.

                            They turns guns into a fetish.    This goes back a long way.  I have an old tape from the 80s with a documentary on it about the fetish of guns. It was a story on the mixing of bikini clad women holding big guns.  IIRC, it was called “Sexy Girls, Sexy Guns”  It’s been decades since I’ve seen it and I’m sure it was anti-gun propaganda, but the whole idea of a video tape full of girls in bikinis holding and shooting guns stuck with me because of how insane it is.

                                Conservative men gobble that stuff up, especially the ones with dotters.
It reveals a disturbing trend of such men desiring submissiveness under control of a strong female.
Pathetic and disgusting, quite like the modern Western male.  Little wonder they are ruled over by women.

                                Starting in the 2000s, Israel started marketing sexy “IDF girls” in “lad mags” like Maxim and then on the internet. They had them in outfits that were juuuust tight enough to show off the goods, not to mention guns and of course the Israel flag. The hotties were usually put alongside some grotesque Middle Eastern protestor – “choose your side, goy”.
Turns out they’re mostly hired Eastern European models, you just have to laugh at a certain point. The whole “hot conservative babe” thing is so cringe and as my example shows it was quickly turned into something insidious.

                                Just so. The problem with 2A’ers are not the guns per se, it’s gun culture, the notion that gun ownership is a cornerstone part of your identity and of political culture.Next to the Swiss, the Swedes are the most gunned-up people in Europe but it never enters into discussions about politics or identity or sovereignty. I assume Swedes have websites and online fora where they discuss gun stuff, but you never hear anyone mention guns in their online dissident discussions, guns being in the same category as power tools.It seems to me that muh guns, in fact, are detrimental to nationalist political awareness, because  they act like a comfort blanket: as long as I have muh guns, I don’t need to engage politically or worry about Commies and Jews taking over America, because if a Commie comes to my doorstep to take away muh rights, I can simply shoot him.And since Freud has already been posted in this thread, let’s not even touch on that…

                                    “Next to the Swiss, the Swedes are the most gunned-up people in Europe but it never enters into discussions about politics or identity or sovereignty.”It certainly should though. I’m also pretty sure those Commies and Jews would love to take their guns away too. I’ve heard that the Swedes (and Finns, not sure about Norway) have quite a lot of private firepower. It may just be that no one has ever successfully ginned up a proper “gun control movement” in those European nations and so gun owners in those countries don’t feel as threatened as we do.Another thing about American style gun control is that it’s become another way, along with pandering to the gheys, to focus on “performative” politics. What I mean by that is that it’s something for a Democrat politician to make a big show of supporting while doing absolutely nothing to deal with the real problems in his (more likely her) district. Indeed, to the extent that these people do anything, it will be something that makes the problems worse. The best you can hope for is that you get a lazy one who spends most of his time jetting around the world to wherever you can bugger boys and get good drugs.Gun control is also the only remaining way the Left has of pretending to be tough on crime. Many American Democrat run shitholes like Portland OR have basically legalized crimes other than murder or rape because the DAs are corrupted by Soros and other money.Gun grabbing is also a way for the loathesome hipsters and queers in the metro areas to harass people in the suburban and rural parts of their state. In the US guns are really a proxy for a bunch of other things. Eventually, we’ll get around to actually talking about those things – and the country will fall apart. When it does, I want to be well armed.Anyway, I still like you Felix and hope you keep posting.

                                        It certainly should though. I’m also pretty sure those Commies and Jews would love to take their guns away too.But I just don’t see how owning a gun protects you from tyranny. Unless people go full Breivik on a mass scale, there’s no conceivable way that a gun could protect you from Commies legislating gun ownership away or, indeed, giving your country away to random passers-by.Gun restrictions are simply not a political issue in Scandiland, not in my lifetime. You cannot get a carry permit and there’s a lot of red tape and expenses and mandatory training involved, but if you really want a gun, you can own pretty much the same types of ordnance as you can in most US states.It seems to me that the gun issue in the US is a conventient and completely inconsequential edge issue that can be pulled out by either party whenever they want to rile up their voting base.Want to distract people from actual political issues? Just threaten to ban high-capacity barrels, bump magazines, oppressors or automatic stocks, and you’ll have sound and fury for weeks and months, while you ram through mandatory koksokking for kindergarten students.

                    So true.  It’s about getting to usurp the masculine part and role, so that’s quite a jolt of resentment-activated bliss.

                            Not that these ferals think ahead.  But here in AZ, this will guarantee 14 years minimum—unless the DA can’t think of another more serious crime to charge.  I assume the female cop recuperated with just ego loss.  Sat on a jury once and every officer with a bruise was stood up and the perp was charged repeatedly—double penalty—for assault.  Double penalty and terms must be served consecutively.  Easily a life sentence for a simple tussle.

Chicks think they’re superheroes now, after three decades of Hollywood propaganda telling them they are FAR more badass than mere men.
Like Policebabe that took that left hook to the jaw, the U.S. is going to learn painfully and suddenly that turning its daughters into men = disaster.

            The very term “insurance” has been corrupted. You’ll hear these “experts” talk about healthcare “insurance” – like Obamacare – when there’s no concept of underwriting. An elaborate system of cross-subsidization with no link between rate and risk could be many things, but it ain’t insurance.

            One thing to look for to know you are getting bullshitted is the term “expert” in lieu of job title or membership in a professional organization or a license.  In this case an actuarial member of the  Society of Actuaries.
The term expert means nothing legally.  No body confers the title of “expert” on anyone. There is no penalty for claiming to be an “expert” when you really aren’t.

                Indeed.  In court on trials we (jury) sat through an examination of such people by the attorneys present.  The judge then made the ruling as to the “expertness” of the witness testifying.  Of course, as we learned today, much of the testimony was as to this persons credentials.  😉

            Spot on.  Coincidentally, my last rodeo before retirement included “de-risking” California for a major insurer.  Dealing w/the CA DOI and their retained “experts” was surreal.  It was cargo cultish…just keep chanting the magic incantations and all would be ok. We finally threw up our hands and unlike our industry brethren opted for the “Margin Call” “be first” strategy.  It worked.  Got most off the books by 2022. The Palisades fire footprint would have produced a 10 figure gross loss…we got to very low 9 figures. I’m still waiting for the fruit basket from my former employer.But see these parallels everywhere now in the so called “elites”.  Sort of like bad actors reading poorly written scripts with no idea why the magic words aren’t working.

        The old man hired on at Douglas Aircraft as a Draftsman C in 1963. Everyone that applied for a job at Douglas was given a form of an IQ test and placed within the company based on the examination. He was placed on the engineering tract and eventually retired as a Senior Lead Engineer from Boeing (spit). Griggs v. Duke Power Co ended this and farmed out employee selection to the Universities. Thus, supercharging credentialism and ending meritocracy in these United States.

            In fairness, 40% of people now have bachelor’s degrees. That at least helps narrow the pool down. As to the other 60%? You should have gone to college.

                “As to the other 60%? You should have gone to college.”I assume you are being supercilious wrt the above.  As I’ve repeatedly stated, when everyone “goes to college”, college degrees become meaningless—not because everyone has one, but because the standards for a degree become meaningless (watered down) in order to accommodate the lowest common denominator.The truth of the above is evident with a simple look at what has happened to High School degrees in the last couple of generations since government attempts to get/mandate everyone to finish such.  Anyone here think graduating HS has any meaning wrt merit—at least in the positive sense?

                    My point is that whatever the number was in the past, let’s say 10% with college degrees, that may not be a big enough pool of potential applicants to meet your needs, so you are forced to dig into the other 90% by necessity. When 40% of the people have college degrees, you would think that would be enough to narrow down the high performing people for you without having to search through the entire 100%. And let’s face it, there may be some diamonds in the rough in that other 60%, but mostly not and why make things hard on yourself?I’m not saying the entire 40% is high performing, just that the pool should be large enough to sift out the high performing people within it, narrow things down and make your job easier.

                            No knock on people without credentials, by the way. My grandfather had a third grade education. Of course, it was a European third grade education so it was an intensive three years. He was a pretty sharp guy, but life still wasn’t easy, even in those days.

You need to define criteria other than a degree to select your potential candidates.Been through this once before with HR.  They got a bug in their butts wrt positions in tech support.  New job description they proposed had a “Computer Science” degree required.  However, the “field” of Computer Science was in its infancy and degree issuing departments were few at the time.  This of course was unknown to them (HR).  We settled upon a CS degree and/or alternative years of experience in the field, which left the judgment of candidate qualifications where it belonged—with the hiring department!

It still does not address problems with your assumption that only “smart” people get college degrees.One good reference deserves another (more to the point and also the correct comparison).  Are you familiar with Bryan Caplan’s book, “The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money”?  The long and short of it is the finding that about all a college degree shows for today’s typical student I’m today’s typical college is the ability to attend four years of boring class lectures consistently.  Great stat’s on just what one learns and—most importantly—remembers.There is data presented wrt employers (such as yourself ?) and the inept hiring process in which employers select only college graduates as a “lazy man’s” first pass in candidates.

                                    Just so, Compsci. And while I admit that reading an article or two aboutGriggs vs. Dukedoes not an employment law attorney make, while IQ tests as screenig was banned, testing or other qualification verification is allowedwhen relevant to a particular job.In this over-credentialed world, especially when many of those credentials aren’t very worthy of credence, so to speak, I suspect some employers give various types of (non-IQ) testing to candidates. Inconvenient, time consuming and costly, but it may well be the only reliable way a would-be employer can gauge the value of a candidate. So many credentials have just become not worth the paper they’re printed upon.

                                Only slightly.  If we are talking difficult and challenging curriculum, i.e., STEM, then about 22-25% of students major in and graduate in such.  The other 75+%, Humanities, Social “Sciences”, and arg…even Psychology!
Does your particular job require such STEM ability or even a college degree?  If not, you are wasting your time and overlooking perhaps better candidates due to your bias Credentialism preference).

            I have masters in both aeronautical and electrical engineering and my specialty is what is known as “fly-by-wire” systems and cockpit switchology and design. It’s a wonderful job if you love numbers and airplanes like I do.It’s even more interesting considering I flew C-130s for 20-plus years as a reservist and later an Air National guardsman. I still fly monthly as an instructor at the nearby airport and I’ll fly until I medically can’t do it anymore (I’m in my early 50s).There’s something to be said for real life experience that most of these credentialed fools wouldn’t know if it bit them in the ass. Why we’ve turned control of this complex civilization to these glad-handing empty suits is a mystery to me.

                The old man was a/the structural guy. Once, when I was about five, we were driving by LAX on the way to my granny’s house in Santa Monica when an enormous jumbo jet was taking off right over the car. I looked at the old man with the obvious question in my eyes. The old man: “Don’t ask me, I don’t know how the hell they stay up there”.

                Well, here’s part of the answer to the riddle–the old-time, hands-on, practical experts were horrifyingly white and male. And seeing as how actual objective merit largely excludes the perverse and the diverse, a more “holistic,” i.e. irrelevant measure of “merit” had to supplant the old one. This is the “I” prong of the DIE project, and it’s been going on for several decades.

                    The engineers who taught me my trade were all old and white. Several of them had worked under the legendary Clarence “Kelly” Johnson and they were amazing men who’d figured out how to solve problems that we couldn’t even grasp today.I realized early on that while my college experience gave me a thin base of knowledge, the amount I didn’t know could fill the danged ocean.My project team is 80% white and 20% Asian, mostly Korean with a few Japanese and one Chinese-descent guy who speaks with a Southern accent, is a Baptist and can eat pulled pork and mashed potatoes like it’s going out of style. There are no women. We’ve had a few and they didn’t last. Not because we’re misogynists, but because they couldn’t handle this is a no slack team with no room for non-hackers.The Indian guys we had didn’t last because they couldn’t get along with the rest of our team. And did I mention they were horrifically incompetent?We had to constantly check and redo their work.They were quickly transferred where their idiocy couldn’t do any serious damage or let go. The few black engineers that work at our facility are either extremely competent and great guys or horrifically incompetent and surly to boot. There are very few women here and it’s not for lack of trying by our HR department.I heard from people I know in the industry at Boeing that the incompetent are allowed to retain their jobs in the service of DEI. And we wonder why the 737MAX had the issues it did.That and their outsourcing of design work to India and the dope-smoking blacks who man their South Carolina plant. One of the quality control guys I went to school with said the amount of fixes required on those airplanes built there is frightening.

The problem here is that recent DIE implementation has broken the back of the corporations wrt the numbers of incompetents who can be managed in the above manner.  There are only so many “bullshit” positions available in a division such that the remaining can do the needed work.
Have a son in the industry and can relate such.

                            The “Peter Principle” was a big hit 50 year ago in the pop science mag’s.  It’s today’s Dunning-Kruger Effect in popularity.  Problem is such concept has repercussions in real life—like death and destruction.Case in point, the Boeing 737 max crashes.  Boeing thought they could automate flying to pushing icons on a screen.  One icon for take off, another for landing.  It was a dream come true for third world crapholes wanting to run their own airlines flown by their own people—and that’s how Boeing sold it to them.Well, it worked until it didn’t.  Then there were a lot of people dead to clean up.

            I think of the acceleration of credentialism across three generations of my family. As I may have noted here before:My grandfather became a “Production Line Manager” in an electronics and telecommunications manufacturing company tied to Ma Bell with only a High School diploma. No, he wasn’t moving to the C Suites but he was considered a manager who was responsible for people reporting to him and keeping the line moving.My father hired on at the same company and used the GI Bill to get an Engineering degree. Years later he got an MBA to get him in the lower rungs of the C Suites with more people reporting to him (that would be a division of the firm rather than the section of the production line my grandfather had) than my grandfather did.Me? Comp Sci degree, told many times to get an entry level management position I’d need to get an MBA first. Well, I’m also an Evil White Male so . . .  😒Credentialism strikes me as tailor-made for the “Tracy Flicks” of the world to check the boxes and get lots of letters and certifications after their name but have a knowledge base a mile wide and barely an inch deep. However it IS fun to watch the girlbosses mentally jam up when you suggest that they could, y’know,MANAGEand make a decision. 😏

        Pretty simple. An expert is someone who has repeatedly achieved tangible and successful results in the real world. A plumber who has installed the plumbing system to dozens of homes or offices that work perfectly is an expert. An entrepreneur is someone who has started several successful businesses is an expert in starting businesses.Now, an expert who is also highly educated is a nice bonus. They likely have a broader and deeper understanding of their field – and life in general – than an uneducated expert, though this isn’t guaranteed. But the results come first. The opinion of the less educated but more successful expert is worth much more than his less successful but better educated colleague.

            Reading the above, I can’t help harking back to my undergraduate days and the reading of Socrates final hours in “Crito”.  To wit, the general discussion we are now having in this group.Socrates says:“One must not value all the opinions of men, but only those of some and not others. Nor the opinions of all men, but of those who understand justice and injustice…”He gives an analogy:“Suppose you are training in gymnastics. Would you listen to the praise or criticism of just anyone, or only of the trainer or doctor who knows the art of training?”And here we are (again) today….

        Noam Chomsky (yes, yes, I know…) had a quite penetrating comment on the social sciences when he explained that they sufffered from physics-envy. From memory: “physicists have these incomprehensible theories that enables them to draw far-reaching conclusions, and all these $100-dollar words that nobody understand. We want theories too, we want to draw far-reaching conclusions as well, and use expensive words that nobody understand.”So they think up all these “theories” and believe that they, like Newton in his secluded cottage, are able to draw far-reaching conclusions on the merit of their theories alone, without having to deal with the grubby and exhausting business of studying reality.Open a physics-textbook from 1950 and with a few addenda, it looks exactly the same as a textbook from 2025, while in the meantime, sociology and politology departments have churned out dozen and dozens of “theories”, none of which, amazingly, are ever declared erroneous or defunct, rather than merely out of fashion.Pro tip: If you’re able to find a professor that’s old enough and jaded enough, you can write your thesis based on any long-abandoned theory like cybernetics, institutional functionalism or neo-realism, tag on whatever conclusion at the end, and never mind that only you and the prof have an inkling about how you got from point A to poiint Z, your degree is just rubber-stamped through.As Michel Houllebecckqcck noted, sociology stinks of amateurism, they have neither theory nor empiry.

            His observation fits his academic generation.I’m from a later one, so I watched my unexceptional field (musicology) eject its philological, mathematical, and anthropological core—its pretense to knowledge, if you prefer—and replace it with “politics” (in the stupidest American sense) and women’s complaints about shopping and dating (“autoethnographies”).The theoretical and terminological bloat Chomsky bemoans has been condemned as racism/whiteness for almost half a century now. Deleuze’s last book came out in 1988.Doctors can’t read.It’s like conservative complaints about all those unemployable women with “useless degrees.” They’re your managers. They’re why your son with a computer science MS sends out seventeen hundred résumés and gets one response. They’re who told Elon that white men are retarded—and he believes it, because he’s retarded.Everything is. Intellectualism, pseudo- or otherwise, is not the problem. It doesn’t even exist.

This, by far, is the most drastic — and destructive — change in the U.S.That ‘managerialism’ our host endlessly moans about is due to the sudden and unprecedented ingress of 70 million (largely incompetent) princesses into the workforce, and Big Daddy Fed sez they gotta work somewhere, or else.What happened to the men they supplanted? Streets, prisons, suicides, basements of their parents’ houses. Now the Feds call them ‘incels’ and try to blame all of society’s ills on . . . the victims of their fem-pogrom.You can have feminism or your nation. Suit yourselves.

                    Yep. The United States is an ideologically-driven, pseudo-communist nation. Feminism and racial egalitarianism are at the core of its ideology.
Just as it was more important in the USSR to be a member of the Party than to be a genuine expert, in the U.S. it is more important to have women in positions of power not because they actually know anything, but because they are women.

            Recently, I listened to a lecture by an astronomer regarding studies of “dark matter.” I asked her what exactly makes it dark. She explained that it is called dark because it has no electrons to change energy states and give off any electromagnetic radiation. So, I asked if that meant that dark matter was not composed of any known element. She replied in the affirmative. I commented to my wife that it was understandable why there are skeptics about dark matter (and its cousin, dark energy). We are asked to believe that something completely different from the elements that make up the known universe exists in huge abundance out there somewhere. I’d rather believe in Santa Claus.

                Same with string theory: they use made-up math to prove their made-up subparticulars. There’s a reason Einstein never got a Nobel Prize for his relativity theory: it’s all speculation until the lab results are in, which only were were sometimes in the seventies, when Einstein was  too dead to get prize.
But classical physics has been virtually unchanged in the last 100 years,

                    it’s all speculation until the lab results are in, which only were were sometimes in the seventies
Hold on, I was thinking about the principle of quantum nonlocality. The relativity theory is, AFAIK as yet unproven.

                    Except you’re not supposed to take physics on faith.
It’s understood that string theory is merely an unproven theorem, whereas you’re expected to accept that the divine is in a magisterium where the usual rules of evidence, logic and reason don’t apply, that your belief, by definition, must rest on naked faith alone.

                        Faith is effectively the suspension of disbelief in the face of the unprovable. Most of theoretical physics’ “unproven theorems” strike me as far more disbelievable than the mere existence of God. And at any rate, we’re supposed to have “faith” that the theorem will eventually be proved. Nothing more than a pseudo-scientific crap in the wind, AFAIC.

                            Nobody expects you to have “faith” in string theory, you’re expected to weigh the available evidence, not just take it as gospel because this or that professor said so.Granted, that’s woefully often how it happens in practice because careers, grants and monster egos are at stake, but if you ask any physicist in the abstract, he will tell you that this is exactly how science is supposed to work and that “trust muh science” is a preposterous anti-scientific nonsense, since the essence of science is scepticism, the anti-thesis to faith.Given enough time, bad theories are weeded out as happened with ether theory, phlogiston or the geo-heliocentric cosmology of Tycho Brahe, and is indeed happening with string theory these years as the proponents are pensioned off.

                                    I never claimed anything to the contrary, I said that physicists were subject to consideration of careers and grants, but that doesn’t change the principles of the scientific method.
To flip the argument, I figure that a lot of people living in Christians communities will, due to social pressure, mouth the confession even if they don’t actually understand how the Trinity works.
Scientist are people too, subject to human frailties and corruption, as the Corona hoax so convincingly demonstrated. That doesn’t invalidate the basic tenets.

                                        I’m not suggesting it invalidates the basic tenets. What I am saying is that belief in unproved theorems, perhaps with some prestigious physicist substituting for the Godhead, is a profession of faith not unlike religious faith. The scientific method itself is something else altogether.

                I saw an episode of NOVA on PBS some years back in which they were interviewing some chick “astronomer” from some university.She described how in two billion years, the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way would engage in an “intergalactic dance” and get sucked into a gigantic black hole.As she spoke her eyes lit up and she became animated and got a crazed look like a fucking Hare Krishna.I shut the television off in disgust. It wasn’t “science,” it was pure horseshit. She was anthropomorphizing entire galaxies and making up a fucking fairy tale about what was going to happen in two billion years. Nobody knows, neither does she.People who claim to have scientific credentials can be more full of shit than the most lurid mythmaker or religious nut.

            “Social sciences” are more properly within the realm of humanities and philosophy. Attempts to empiricize these fields and turn them into “sciences” like chemistry have produced rubbish.You can’t apply the Scientific Method and prove or disprove hypotheses in these fields by running controlled tests in a lab to get verifiable results.The closest you can come to that is the study of history, to analyze human mistakes and successes in the past. This is why the study of ancient Greek philosophy and literature were historically considered the mark of an educated man — because the Greeks had accurately understood and described the perennial dilemmas facing Man, and as an educated elite you were supposed apply their insights to avoid or manage the predictable pitfalls of human nature.

”…the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recently experienced a significant controversy during its 2025 commencement events. Megha Vemuri, the class president, delivered a speech at the OneMIT ceremony on May 30, 2025, where she criticized MIT’s financial ties to Israeli defense entities and condemned the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. She called for the university to sever these affiliations and expressed solidarity with Palestinian rights.”
This may not qualify as DIE, but it does reflect upon the type of student now admitted to this once vaunted institution.

Her graduate degree is a doctorate of philosophy yet she worked at Duke med school.Although it looks like she has some scientific credentials, her career seems to be very ideologically-driven:“She is interested in the role of programmed cell death in regulating the length of female fertility in vertebrates”“In 2014, Kornbluth becameprovostat Duke, the first woman to serve in this role. As provost, she oversaw a leadership transition in which female Deans became a majority at Duke.”“In 2022, Kornbluth was selected as the 18th president of MIT… At her inauguration, she outlined objectives for MIT, including accelerating work on climate change”Sally Kornbluth – Wikipedia

                                An academic chick named Kornbluth who’s also a feminist–knock me over with a ruddy feather. Sometimes I think so-called “stereotypes” are the purest form of truth.

                                    Perhaps just a coincidence but another Kornbluth was a mid-20th century science fiction writer. One of his most famous stories, “The Marching Morons” (1951) is a satirical vision of a future where the competent, the scientists, have been effectively enslaved to support the bigger population of mediocrities. I don’t think the problem was due to credentialism run amuck, but I thought it at least tangentially relevant to today’s topic.

            In chess you have to demonstrate your prowess in every game. It doesn’t matter whether you have the title of “grandmaster” — you can’t browbeat your oppoent into resigning with the “authority” of your title. It’s true, though, that players are frequently intimidated psychologically when playing a higher-rate opponent.

        “Groupthink” is always around. It takes the courage of the little girl who pointed out the emperor was stark naked. I recall that around 18 years ago Peter Schiff was warning that property prices were due to take a fall. He used to be invited to television shows just so that the “experts” could make fun of him. Those invitations dried up after 2008, when it turned out he was right. Those “experts” remained, though. The problem is that if you’re not an “expert”, you usually don’t even have a voice.

            Was Schiff right? That momentary blip in the market did not translate to a fall on housing prices. Further, all the doomsayer predictions about the results of the mortgage crisis turned out to be wrong. His prediction that we were headed to another collapse in 2013 was wildly wrong.https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2013/03/05/peter-schiff-and-the-coming-housing-collapse-the-fed-instead-of-lehman-owns-the-mortgage-market/
If you are always predicting something bad will happen, eventually you will hit on something that you point to as validating your prediction.

                Without endless intervention i’d say he was right. The constant intervention is going to destroy the economy one way or another. Remember Zman, the experts will scream at you if you say 2020 was an economic event, yet we’ve been running 2 trillion in red ink every year since, unemployment was set to 50k, student loans were in forbearance for five years, home owners didn’t have to pay their mortgage, renters didn’t have to pay rent, all to fight a virus eh? What is the price of gold now?Not only that, but each intervention gets more desperate and expensive:  DOT.com bubble bursts= lower rates to 1%which leads to housing bubble that bursts= lower rates to 0% and buy government bonds at that rate because the market wontwhich reflates stock and housing bubble which bursts in 2020= i think you all still remember the reaction to that…………

                He was right. What he couldn’t predict (and I couldn’t either) was how the establishment would kick the can down the road with trillions of dollars created out of thin air. But the problems he identified remain in place. There will be a reckoning. And that’s probably, arguably, occurring right now.

                I agree with the replies here. For the crash he was absolutely correct. For the rest he is right in essence about the nature of the problem. What he nor anyone could see is how long the can could be kicked down the road. Where Schiff is not right enough is in his discussion of the scale and scope of the distortions the planners are making to forestall the reckoning. They have opened up every market and aspect of American life to foreign predation to do so.Chinese, Indian, Arab wealthy people are coming in and buying up high and mid level real estate with cash, and the country has been flooded with tens of millions of people to keep a bid underneath many goods – including housing by paying for them to be here and stay here.Gold isn’t a moonshot but in 2005 you could get it for $500-$550 an ounce. It is up six times.There is a lot not to like about Schiff and that type of doomsayer, but he is correct that the experts have created a disaster. The issue is waiting for doom is a bad idea because you lose out on the ride up during the hyper looting phase.

That is how they keep this nightmare going.  Counting on your greed, so nobody demands reform.  What was Judas price again? Ten pieces of silver?

                    Schiff is a doomsday grifter.  As Z-man said, someday he’ll be right, but that’s not the way to judge his “grift”.
Here’s an example.  From ChatGPT:
Bottom line: A $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 in 2005 would now be worth around $65,000–70,000 in 2025, assuming reinvested dividends.…A $10,000 investment in gold in 2005 would now be worth about $53,000…
So listening to Schiff to sell and invest in gold as an alternative to the economic problems he rails about was a loser.

                            Absolutely, but the game here was to hedge against such devaluation (inflation).  A Schiff move to gold was not—as it turned out—the best way to hedge.

                                Opinions vary. My sentiment is that the bailouts required to keep stock prices high will falter. But the gold will remain gold and will maintain purchasing power. Is it an investment? No. Merely real money, as J.P.Morgan pointed out a long time back. Stocks are an investment and predicated on a healthy, functioning economy which I just don’t see. I suppose for a more extreme example of price appreciation you could cite bitcoin — what Schiff calls “fool’s gold” — but I don’t have any faith in that either. But to reiterate, opinions vary.If this were 1950 and I had $5,000 I’d put it in  Coca-Cola or IBM. By 1972, if I put it in the former, it would be around $55,000; if the latter around $108,000.  In gold I’d have gained nothing. But this was a period when there was a vibrant real economy.

                        But then we have the distinction between tangible and intangible, which isn’t always clear. Most products these days are electronically based and mostly involve intangible knowledge. Even back in the old days when we produced things that were more substantial, there was a large amount of intangible capital involved.
So, I don’t know what the answer is.

                                For years I’ve been pondering some of the many topics Nietzsche discusses in his books, especiallyBeyond Good and Evil. He makes an excellent case that a lot of human belief is basically shit we make up, to put it in crude modern terms. He asserts that to some degree these “false” beliefs may be useful, even essential, for human life as we know it.To return this (more or less) to the current thread: The credit card in my pocket is really just a piece of plastic with a computer chip embedded. The dollar bills are just paper and ink. Yet I can exchange those for real world good and services in a mind-boggling number of locations and possible permutations. All because of what’s effectively a shared illusion (delusion?) called an economy, a banking system, and so forth. An economy at its most primitive would be barter. Modern economy relies on credit, debt, and perhaps a thousand other abstracts that don’t really have a physical existence. Everything works well…for a while at least.

                            It seems to me that you buy gold in case the country goes tits up and we end up in a Mad Max kind of situation. And if we end up in that kind of situation, you’re just going to have miscreants running around taking things from people. I do worry about the destruction of the dollar, however.

                                I try to keep an open mind about the gold vs stocks debate, but it seems like every article I read advocating for gold has links that direct you to people who sell it. (probably ditto for the articles advocating stocks)
You’ll note that in the term real estate is the word “real.” And that throughout history, the phrase “wealthy landowners” sees common usage, but nobody ever says wealthy goldowners, or wealthy stockowners.

                        Hey CompSci. Good to see you here today. Yes. That was my point about battening down the hatches on the doomerism. Holding some gold and realizing 6x gains at intervals and investing in other areas has been a good approach. To sit there on gold and gold alone has been a disaster for those who followed that path.For me the value in that sphere has been to understand inflation and hedging vs. leveraging it. Having an early days position has been a boon for me doing portfolio rebalancing. Anybody who is going about riding crazy gains with no understanding of the reality of the emperor’s wardrobe situation is in as bad a state when SHTF as the holed up in gold and guns since ’93 doomer.Best to understand all perspectives. Schiff got the real estate thing all wrong in the long run. His analysis there did not take into account opening up the GAE to foreign predation and the duration of ZIRP and it being effective. It also misses that when the dollars come crashing back in ever larger waves, good real estate will hold its value and be an incredible hedge. For those with leverage and an inflation advantage income stream are going to be rich. It is likely that many of them are Saudis, Chinese and Indians who will probably come in and fight to rule post-America when the gig is up.

        Well what is expertism and managed credentialism?  It is a counterfeit of authenticity, is it not?  An inferior product, a deke.  A lie.In the Fifties when I was a kid, America largely was a masculine nation, displaying timeless masculine values such as probity and honor.  The ubiquity of Christianity at the popular level was a major factor thereto, as real Christianity places high worth on truth, to extent that God as the Son IS the Truth incarnate.  The Mooslims, by compare, cleave to taqiyyah.Heh.  They’ll do great in New Amerika!Modern Amerika is a feminine nation, and in case you’ve been rooming with Mr. Van Winkle, chicks don’t do truth and honor.  Most females are practical creatures interested in the bottom line as relates to, well, themselves.  Childbirth and family help channel this solipsistic aspect of female nature towards positive and productive use.Your nations aren’t just a-masculine, but virulently anti-masculine. The institutions crap out experts and credentialed managers, but the whole deal is a profitable lie, monstrous in its attraction and inertia.Imported Africans and Arabs will assimilate, lie.  Diversity is good, lie.  Homos just wanta be left alone to sodomize each other, lie.  Your daughters can captain ships and steer copters, lie.  (The cockroaches scrambled for weeks to cover that one up!)Point is you’re a nation and culture deficient, and often devoid, of truth.  Of acceptance of factual reality, largely because the nation is devoid of authentic masculinity in positions of influence and power, including the churches.

        “To solidify their hold, they create arbitrary barriers of entry into the domain of expertise, which are called credentials.”This is an old problem that I remember from my youth.  The biggest culprit is government who promulgate/require licensure, which inevitably shrinks entry into fields of endeavor while simultaneously promotes less qualified, but more credentialed entrants into such fields.One good example, still found, is K-12 teaching.  You can’t be certified most anywhere without a painful 4 year Education “degree” and a couple years as a teacher’s assistant in the classroom.  As a result, we get all sorts experienced professionals, who upon retirement, are unable to undertake second careers in the classroom imparting their knowledge—yes, and real expertise—to the next generation.  Imagine, a retired engineer with 25 years designing missile systems for Raytheon, can’t get a job teaching HS math.  Whereas a newly graduated 20 something with a BA in “Education” can—even without a major in Mathematics—at the university level!

            The education curriculum is absurd and useless.  It keeps non-progressives out of the field.  There is absolutely no reason to require a degree to teach kids.
It’s worse than you even know.  Almost all school districts require continuous additional education credits and eventually a higher degree.

                The so-called “scholarship” in education is the most maniacally anti-white of any field. It is also the stupidest. Most of the problem with education in AINO is that half of the “students” are ineducable savages, but the insipid, anti-white ideology that determines pedagogy and curriculum is also a part.

Published in 2010, this work presents a provocative critique of the American education system, challenging the common narrative that places blame on teachers, curricula, or funding for poor student performance. Instead, Weissberg argues that the primary issue lies with the students themselves, suggesting that many are disengaged, lack discipline, and are unmotivated to learn. He contends that these student-related factors are significant contributors to educational shortcomings, rather than systemic issues within schools.What I still find great about this book was how annotated it was listing government programs and research papers and the like wrt the problems in education he discussed.  It also was a back door way to introduce race and demographic change into the discussion of our declining educational school system.  Overton window stuff.

                        Back when common sense was still pretty much the coin of the realm, this sort of argument would have been obvious. Stupid, lazy, immature, dysfunctional youths, except for in the very rarest of instances, cannot be educated. They have neither the capacity nor the interest to learn abstract thinking and academic skills. In a more rational system such youths would be tracked into vocational education where they might possibly be able to learn skills that would allow them to become productive members of society. But for the worst, they have no business on a school campus whatsoever.

                Teacher’s Colleges and Teacher Programs in regular universities are a complete scam.  The curriculum is a joke, and after you finally get your credential, the colleges keep sucking on you like a sea lamprey with their endless Extended Education bullshit.
The teaching colleges and programs are ruled, and staffed, almost exclusively by women. . . who, btw, also are the brainwashers of your children into Woke, Feminism, Homosexuality and ever-so-much more.

        Credentialism will never die as long as women have the right to vote.
Many Uni educated women, especially those in the managerial class, need to feel that they are in sync with the experts so any attack on what they think is an attack on the truth. Repeating the views of chosen experts enables them to feel smart.
This is also true of Liberal and middle of the road men but they don’t bring as much gusto to it and don’t get as much satisfaction destroying opponents of the experts as do women.

        The movie “Braveheart” depicts epic chaotic battles between warring groups of crudely armed men who assemble at opposite sides of a large open field and then charge at each other in screaming waves of fury and physicality. A melee ensues in which life is wantonly extinguished with a single stroke of the sword or mace. A truly manly way to die. The part of this that is under-appreciated is that the poseurs with the phony credentials are typically the first to go down. Evolution benefits from this type of culling.

            William Wallace and his Scots actually mowed down the English as they foolishly decided to attack across a bridge (The Battle of Stirling Bridge). The Scots were able to bring their main force against the small number of English as they exited the end of the bridge. It was something like the crossing of the T in naval warfare.

        It really all depends on the subject.  Most of the subjects that end up in these expertise debates have tenuous claims to being some kind of expert.  A fine example are these “misinformation/disinformation” self-appointed experts, or all the people claiming to be nutrition experts.But there are many subjects where only the expert opinions are worth following, but they rarely end up being debated online.Take a look at the world around you and then tell me you don’t trust the experts.  Chances are good you will go over a bridge today.  That bridge has been standing for decades, quietly doing its job.  Or start your car. An army of automotive engineers created that car.  Lots of buildings that have been standing 100 years.  Or even just the logistics of keeping your supermarket full.The rise of fake and quasi experts should not cast doubt for actual experts.

        Don’t have much to say about experts and credentialism. Except that I pose here as an expert on many subjects, but I have no credentials in any of them lol. I had an uncle by marriage who was executive vice-president of R&amp;D at one of the major oil companies (the original “7 sisters”). He was in charge of hundreds of science and engineering postgrads but he only had an undergrad business degree. His only skill was in handling people, which he was very good at.My father-in-law also worked for an oil company back in the 80s. He did have a much-sought after credential. One day his department received the news that a new boss had been hired. Their new boss was a black guy. At their first meeting, he came in and said a few words. The first thing he said was “You know why I’m here. Just keep doing what you’re doing.”

        The other day I was shopping for a pair of jeans in a Dillard’s department store. Well, you know how it is. When the sound system in places like this isn’t blasting terrible music, it’s bawling out various promos. You come to expect it, and if you’re lucky, manage to tune it out.That’s what I was doing when something, despite my best efforts, caught my ear. In one of the store promos some dame was rabbiting on about how this or that blouse or perfume or whatever–the product is irrelevant–is worn by “the influencer Kaylee Widdershoven [or whoever]!”I’ll admit, I stopped in my tracks. Influencer? This is a real thing? Something so significant that a billion-dollar corporation will actually use it to try to sell product? Lord love a duck. All I could do was shake my head. Clown world, man. Clown world.

        Maybe related, maybe not, but one of the people on the Civic Association board sent out an email about some break-ins in the neighborhood. She signs her emails as “Dr. Jane Doe, PhD, Ed.” Or something like that. The wife was also trying to start a business signing her email as “Jane Doe, MBA, President and CEO” of her shïtty little business that never got off the ground. I’m proud of her for getting her degree, but I always thought her signature was stupid.

            “I always thought her signature was stupid.”Her signature is a “tell” of sorts.  That is to say, she depends upon her credentials for credibility and status rather than her actions.  She is insecure in her knowledge and performance and therefore must intimidate others into not questioning her actions and decisions. The entire topic of today’s Z-man missive.I remember my grad student days.  Perhaps it was just the luck of meeting my major professor who guided me through the process, but such “airs’ as you describe were quickly beaten out of me.  Such was looked down upon. Indeed, it was a running joke concerning physicians in the Med School, who continuously called each other “doctor” so and so in mutual conversation.   😉

                That could be part of it, but she’s also definitely proud of herself for getting that Notre Dame MBA. I’m a cheapskate so I told her just to go to the University of Cincinnati where she was accepted. She wanted the designer label. Oh, and then there’s the fact that her sister is a doctor and she feels she has to measure up.

Wow, that’s just fabulous.  What a feather in her cap to wave around to the world, showing she is Independent and Capable and Don’t Need No Man.
How many children has she got?  Seeing as how our elites inundate the nation with invaders because the female citizenry is out getting Proud Degrees from Prestigious Universities while the birth-rate — and nation — fail.
I’m sure she is just tremendously proud, however.  Notre Dame eh, good ole Our Lady.  Proud proud proud.

        The worst aspect of these credentialed “experts” is that they foist their actual lack of expertise on the rest of us.  They do nothing but gum up the things that work, to the detriment of everyone else.  When the time comes, they will be put to real work – maybe digging ditches or cleaning latrines…

            Disagree, the worst aspect is even after repeated failures, they never get fired, they never go to jail.  They’re still an “expert”.  Ask yourself why the political class and CEOS refuse to let us have an honest to god old time recession?  Why do they mortgage the future at insane costs of money?  Because a real recession that wiped out bad corporate debt and caused actual pain would finally lead to change in the system.  Makes you think of the old line, if voting changed anything, they wouldn’t let you do it.

                For decades, Republican voters have been told they must vote for the GOP in order to put good conservative judges into the court system. We had eight years of Reagan, four of Bush, eight more from another Bush, and now five with Trump.It made no difference whatsoever, none, as we see district court judges exercising executive-branch-level authority with no pushback from their colleagues whatsoever. Where, we can ask, are the “conservative” judges we were promised?Now that the “we must keep the Supreme Court conservative!” angle has been destroyed, I wonder what will motivate GOP voters the next few times around. I doubt there’s much. Voting changed, and changes, nothing.

                    I’m no republican, something about the GOP was always off-putting to me but what would the make-up of the courts and the even more destructive effects on society look like without those picks? At least there was some resistance. Mostly agree with you though about their general cowardice and self-serving fecklessness.

                “…the worst aspect is even after repeated failures, they never get fired, they never go to jail. They’re still an “expert”. “
That’s because these “experts” prey upon the ignorance of the masses.  Was it Barnum that said “…there’s a sucker born every minute…”. And so it seems.
WRT a grifter like Schiff, I have learned to simply ignore any and all his missives.  If I see his name mentioned in any writing or video, I simply ignore such.  If I can blacklist it, I do so.  What else can one do at our level?

                    Sure, but you’re just describing someone who keeps hammering home his lesson. You wouldn’t be a good student if you never advanced beyond the 101 course. One teacher leads to the next.Peters lesson: Too much debt is bad, protect yourself with gold.Got it! But why is too much debt bad? (next lesson)Got it! But why did the system function from the early 70’s thru the late 90’s on debt and not seem to be too unstable? (next lesson)Got it! So debt needs an equivalent growth in energy for it to actually be productive and sustainable!And so on and so onJim Cramer is a Grifter, i think Peter is honestly trying to help people while making a buck for himself. Different then preying upon people.And honestly i haven’t listened to much of peter probably since the early 2010’s, i grew, moved on.  But he was a good stepping stone.  Do you mind if i ask why you seem to be so against him?

                        To tell you the truth—and it’s embarrassing—it’s been so long, I’ve forgotten. ;-(
However, the sage insight you describe above I’ve gotten elsewhere from other “stepping stones”. Look, life is short, therefore it follows time spent in one area/person is shortchanging another, perhaps even a more informative individual at that.
I don’t remember either when and how I began to ignore Ben Shapiro for example, nor his flunky Matt Walsh. I watched until I was tired of the blatant predictability of their “act” and I moved on.
Did I miss an important educative moment in my later life? Doubtful.

        Part of the attack on Darryl Cooper from the managerial class was exactly this. All the smear articles on him inevitably include the phrase “amateur” historian. This is their signal that he isn’t an “expert” with the proper credentials from a major university.

            History written by vernacular (public) historians is far more likely to be worth a spit than history written by liturgical (academic) historians. It is at least possible for vernacular historians to hew to historical truth. Liturgical historians, on the other hand, must subordinate truth to regnant ideology, and nobody has to twist their arms to do it.

        Credentialism starts at an early age, too. For instance, a large fraction of students awarded high school diplomas in today’s America, by the standards of a few generations ago (OK, maybe three or four), would not have even been allowed toenterhigh school, much less graduate. Similar analogies exist with higher levels of education and no doubt many if not all professional certifications.

        Great essay! A couple of thoughts here:1) Complexity and Big Government give rise to the tyranny of “experts”. The average slob voter can’t keep up. So representative government combines with the “expert class” to screw us. Smaller and simpler are better.2) My read of Peter Turchin’s work is that he wouldn’t disagree at all with Zman here. He uses the term “soi disant” Elites often. Fake it ’til you make it. All the poo flinging we see among our Elites stems from the fact that competing claims are really normative and power-oriented, not scientific.3) In my consulting job (lol), I consult with “experts” all the time. IMHO, the number of true experts is incredibly small and generally limited to technical fields. On Oilprice.com alone, the resident “experts” have been utterly wrong about “peak” Permian Basin oil production for 7 years now, just as one example.

        Credentialism is a factor in managing just about everything. Life, a railroad a baseball team. Experts schemperts. There is no substitute for practical knowledge. In speaking to a finance credentialed idiot in a past life I was reminded of his expertise by said expert when asked ”who has the MBA here?” If he hadn’t set me straight I would have continued along on my merry way ignorant of his superior knowledge and why he had it. Price and cost really are different though they can be the same. Only the MBA’s know for sure. Cost is cost is cost. Real blood? Or is it?

            I find this gentleman to be the best argument against “experts”I would argue our entire political and CEO class is him on steroids. An “expert” at everything except winning battles and the war. Shown up by a failure in everything except the war. Life is strange like that sometimes, and if America is to rise at all from our current downward trajectory i suspect the rejuvenation will come from a no one like Grant again.  Our current “experts” might actually be less talented then George was and just coasting on the hard work and past success of previous leaders. Perhaps that is why their answer to everything is more debt.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._McClellan

                Sometime all that is needed to become an expert is to know and be willing to do what is necessary. All interaction is war on some level. That is the art of it. “When you put your hand in a pile of goo that two seconds before was your best friends face, you will know what to do.” Patton maybe?

                    Indeed, George trained and created the Army of the Potomac.  But was too scared to use it for fear it might break.  That was the difference between him, Grant, and Lee.  Funny story:  Was at Antietam a few years back and we were at Burnsides bridge.  The guide was explaining that Lee continued to move soldiers to different portions of the battlefield as the day went on, where they were needed most.  A lady asked why was he doing this?  To which i replied he was outnumbered 2 to 1 and was forced to shift troops to wherever the pressure was greatest.  George didn’t push a unified front so this was possible.  The guide then replies “well new scholarship shows that Lee wasn’t outnumbered by that much and much of the Union army was cooks and teamsters who didn’t fight”.  That is the biggest load of BS i’ve ever heard and this is from a trained guide (its tough to get that job).  What that tells me is .gov is so scared of revolt currently that they will push some bullshit like that because people are naturally drawn to the rebels in the civil war.  Everyone likes an underdog.

This is the sort of argument one pulls out when they are having a semi-good natured debate over say, sportspuck players they feel are overrated.

        Young people ask me all the time if they should get their PMP certification.  I’ve read through the PMBOK, and it is a complete waste of time.  Industry is LOADED with PMP’s versed in buzzword bingo.  The test costs $1,000.  The training classes are not cheap.And guess what?  You’re now on the hook to do “continuing education” for life an estate.  I look around at the PMP’s and none of them, none, could do my job.  We have all these PMP’s.  Why aren’t projects finishing in time or on schedule?  lol.There are some credentials that are probably worthwhile, but they’re usually tied to a professional license like a doctor, engineer, or general contractor.  But I would wager most of them are a grift designed only to require you to continue to pay them money for the privilege of advertising their letters on your business card.Credentials are a bit like being around retired military.  The first thing they do is drop names and positions they held.  They don’t know how to do shit, but they were a Colonel who knows General Smith.  And that’s their currency.

        Wasn’t The Distributist a communist/socialist not long ago? Maybe five, ten years? I have a hard time listening to him, as he is a bit too effeminate for my tastes. That fellow Cofnas looks sickly, as well, and probably requires assistance opening microwave doors. Goodness we are in trouble.

The human instinct is to keep him away from children.

            When he was young.  He is married with children and supposedly a devout Catholic who defends the faith.
I don’t really like his style, but he is at least somewhat on our side.

        “His analysis in the case of the pending energy sanctions rests not on an understanding of oil markets but on an understanding of the prevailing opinions in the expert class“– great catch. This is what I can’t stand about pundits in other, non-energy subject areas. They write for a specific mutual audience of their friends instead of, I don’t know, posterity; or the cuneiform tablet vault, or whatever… 90% of NY Times and Wash Post op-eds are not worth reading a word of, let alone re-reading, because it is inside baseball every day all the time.

        From a financial and career perspective, what Cofnas is doing makes sense. He is proving his loyalty and trying to prove his utility. It doesn’t seem to be as risk averse and as long lasting as David French’s grift of being a conservative who will always tells the left that anyone who disagrees with them is stupid and evil. There are 10s of millions of leftists who want to hear that.

If the Democrats are reinstalled after Orange Man, Cofnas may need to expand his business model to doxxing heretics.

        “but that the nature of elite degrades over time”One’s nature does not change, as Aesop eloquently demonstrated.It is not the nature of the elite that degrades over time, but rather the mediocrity of the elite that is exposed over time. Like a pile of shit with a veneer of gold, the shine is eventually stripped off and all you are left with is the pile of shit.What is more, the elite have never built anything, they have simply claimed credit for the people who have built. It is just that with time, the pretenders are replaced by those who don’t even bother to pretend.It is fascinating to see how throughout empires, the elite have always degraded. Almost as if they were always piles of shit to begin with.

        I’m not sure the term “practical “ is the right one. Because they do do things. It’s just that it’s more paperwork or email writing or filling in forms and networking in a highly specialized area. They fit into a thing that does stuff it’s just that it’s such a minuscule part of the system that it looks abstract

        I find there is wisdom in the voice of the crowds. Specifically, in this case, the comments sections of popular blogs like Wolfstreet and Mishtalk. These sites have hardcore commenters who live for the joust. Ensconced in their digital castles, they sally forth to do battle with other commenters, often improving on the original message. The sum total of the comments section is usually 2 to 2.5 times as deep as the original blog posting. This is true expertise.

            Greg-AI is definitely improving.
In the comment section of any good blog, or commentary media, comment posting is definitely an equally important aspect of the information imparted. This is why I rail so much against artificial intelligence getting involved. AI will not improve the commentary, rather it will destroy it eventually.
