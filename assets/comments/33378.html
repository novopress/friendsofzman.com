        My goodness… David Kazerashvili. Carl Gershman. Allen Weinstein. Victoria Nuland. What could they all possibly have in common?
For some reason I didn’t see any of them at church on Sunday or eating a Christmas ham, LOL.

                Ironically, Steve Sailer, who coined the phrase, “war on noticing,” now condemns Tradissidents as antisemites for, you guessed it, noticing.

                        My take on Sailer is that, as much he may notice that races vary significantly in their intelligence and criminality, he somehow still expects that intelligent people of all races will share his disinterested respect for truth, which generally only whites have.
He believes that when he makes his observations, intelligent people of all races will abstractly evaluate his claims for their truth value alone. I think that it’s difficult for him to imagine an intelligent non-white saying, “I don’t care if what Sailer says is true, it harms the ability of my group to win.”

                            Sailer lacks any feeling of kinship to his own people and thus can’t understand how other “intellectuals” from other races could feel any connection to the less gifted of their people.Sailer (and Charles Murray) understands group differences, but say, “So what, we’re all individuals.” The idiocy of Libertarianism.That stupidity/naivete might be acceptable from a college freshman but not from anyone over 30. Sailer’s unwillingness to acknowledge that playing as a team is both natural and effective shows that he is either a liar (actually, he is a liar for other reasons) or has a profoundly stunted intellect in certain areas.

                    There are a lot of us who have “noticed” that after Sailer stopped noticing, he received attention like he’s never had, his book published and appeared on Tucker’s show after years of relative obscurity.

                    Sailer has noticed Jewish influence in the past, but he chalks it up to Jews being just so darn smart and hardworking as opposed to working as a team. Obviously, the former does explain some Jewish influence, but it’s the latter that matters by far the most.
Sailer refuses to acknowledge this obvious fact. He is a liar. The only question is why he’s lying. I have my suspicions – he wants to be accepted by the punditry crowd and he’s part Jewish come to mind – but who knows the real reason.

                                Take an athlete who has God-given talent, works hard at training and practicing and honing his skills. That’s what the Jews do with intellectual pursuits. They take education seriously. I believe that is your IQ differential.

                        I agree that he is lying, but the reason he is lying is it just a lot easier to lie.  Noticing most stuff is only a 4th degree felony, while noticing small hats is a first degree felony.  Nothing brings the blowback quite like noticing small hats.  Even such a sacred figure (in their eyes) as Kanye West was immediately cast out and made to suffer.

                    TBH, I think it’s more annoyance with “noticers” pointing out Jews…and the same persons more often than not…  every five seconds. Calling them “antisemites” isn’t accurate, though. They clearly have a hard-on for the nose, they never STFU about it, so clearly not hate specifically. It’s why I use “Jew enthusiast”.  They’re like model train enthusiasts in that they’re too lazy to attain the productive status of actually driving a real train….but watching their toys go ’round the track and yelling “choo choo!” is sufficient.

                    Vote fraud, terrorism, etc., will be included among the excuses, but the present call for digital ID is just to stop people from being able to anonymously mock shit-eating Indians and low-IQ nerds like Elon. They’re being stupidly open about it, because they’re stupid (and victorious).I’ve heard that starting sometime this year if you don’t have RealID you can’t flyanywhere—if you’re an American. (I don’t fly anymore so I don’t know if that’s exactly right.) The strategic deposit of unidentifiable brown hordes in your town will continue, of course, but you can’t visit grandma or go to your hobby’s national convention without your personal Homeland Security buttplug installed.I think by the end of Trump’s(not actually his)term you won’t be allowed on much of the internet if you don’t have your biometric/genetic/etc MuskPass. Because…[spins wheeel]…antisemitism, I think it says? It’s stuck between that and “celebrity stalking.” Public figures and their privatepeoplewill be exempt from identity requirements, but no one who interacts with them will? Something like that.

        The notorious LTC Vindman testimony was an eye-opener in this regard. He basically stated blatantly on National TV that the President couldn’t change the Deep State’s foreign policy. None of the Congresscritters in attendance seemed to have a problem with a junior Army officer openly defying the foreign policy authority of a duly-elected President. So it’s a just a sand wedge from there to Privateers running Deep State operations with no official oversight.

            It can be done though. Departments may be brought to heel.No one doubts Xi controls foreign policy in China and Putin does in Russia.If the deepstate has a weakness, it is that it’s predicated on infinite money sloshing around to fund NGOs and to wet a lot of beaks.33 trillion in debt, a trillion a year just to service it annually; all of this to try and control a corrupt country in Eastern Europe and to allow our greatest ally to stomp its neighbors with impunity when their governments collapse as the people spontaneously “rise up.”What can’t go on, won’t.

                Government is corrupt by nature, because ultimately it relies on the inherently corrupt practices of confiscation and coercion to operate. No way around it. Big government will have big corruption,  small government will have small corruption.
The only way to limit corruption is to limit the funding. This is the only thing the libertarians got right.

                    E. Michael Jones has talked about this. When Putin took control, Russia was being run by some unholy trinity of triple-parentheses oligarchs, the US State Department, and Wall Street. Putin had to take the country back from these gangsters. He had to make it clear that he is in charge now and they need to bend the knee. Xi, also, used anti-corruption measures as a way to take control of the country and ensure he was the one in charge.We need someone to take control of the country away from the deep state. Maybe this is just how it goes, as Plato discussed in terms of government types. But it is where we are at. Now, unfortunately, I really don’t think Trump is that guy. He’s old, he’s been around the block, he’s stared into the abyss. But that’s what we need. I don’t think it is impossible, but the genius of the deep state is that it is able to produce its own front-men and leaders and put them in charge. Barack Obama is probably the high water mark of these efforts.

                The new DOGE department may be Trump’s way to signal that he understands the real problem – if the President tells the bureaucrats in a part of the government to do something, and then they don’t do it, telling them “harder” isn’t going to get the job done. At some point you need to admit that some aspects of the government are hopelessly out ofanyone’s**control and the only way to fix that is either mass arrests or some new agency that is empowered to cut off funding or fire people.The problem is that most of the people chosen to run DOGE, starting with Musk himself seem to be globalist neo-liberal or neo-con types themselves so I doubt there will really be a crackdown where it’s most needed such as the State Dept or the hordes of NGOs that constitute an un-elected and unaccountable shadow state.We may have simply gotten to the point where any purely political reform is not possible or likely to be effective. As has been pointed out, the libertarians get one thing right and that is that without massive funding none of this evil can go on. So we may just need to wait for the whole system of debt financing to collapse to see a change, and that will NOT be fun for anyone.** anyone? Well, the problem in our government is that some parts of it do seem to be directly taking orders from specific people. It’s just that those people have no actual legal authority or government role. George Soros would be an example but there are many lesser known puppeteers as well. The most monstrous aspects of the GAE may simply have no single choke-point or control node that can be dominated to effect decisive change.

            Right.  The President no longer is commander-in-chief.  The DS is.
As for Congress, it seems to exist only to pay off the DS and themselves.  Its legislative function seems not to exist.
Both Congress and the Executive now appear two or three rungs below the actual decision-making level.

        In one of his more interesting interviews, Joe Rogan interviewed a guy named Mike Benz. The 2.75 hour discussion centered largely around how the concept of democracy has been decoupled from populism. Benz used to work for the US State Department who are the public face of all of the meddlesome monkeyshines the United States engages in.One of the things that Benz notes is the conflation of “experts” in the bureaucracy with democracy itself. This is a tough square to circle because nobody votes for them and they seem to operate independently regardless of who is in office.At one point, he highlights a foreign politician who declared that unfavorable electoral outcomes are a threat to democracy.Unsurprisingly, Benz focuses a lot on internet censorship. He notes who NGOs and bureaucrats have used “misinformation” and “disinformation” to clamp down on free speech and even compel speech. Of course, this also flies in the face of “democracy” and as such required a robust campaign to recontextualize unwanted prole opinions as threats to “the democracy freedom values of who we are.” Manufactured consent isn’t a new concept, but the last decade was when the establishment had to go back to the drawing board in order to redesign it for the internet.The interview is well worth the watch as background noise. It doesn’t reveal anything we didn’t suspect, but it catalogues all of the various pieces of the puzzle that’s led to unaccountable sycophants dictating good and evil to the populace.

        Once you start to realize this, you really start to wonder just how fake everything really is. Like, we all know the playbook. It’s the same every time, and they even unleashed it on us in 2020. So, for example, if I go online and try to do more research about Putin kidnapping Ukrainian children, are the people who are talking about it online paid off by the CIA/NED/State/NGOs? Certainly, some of them are. But is it 20%? 50%? 99%? Are they even real people at this point, or are they bots? We saw the CIA unleash a program to gin up support for the Ukraine war on X, it was called NAFO, and it was basically all bots. Even if NAFO was totally cringe and gay, we know they didn’t give up that program. So what are they doing now? There’s no end to this rabbit hole, and it can make you go crazy – which I suppose, is part of the point. The government’s psy op experiments starting in the 1950s were all about getting people to become unmoored from reality. They used a blunt instrument at first – mind-altering drugs, unleashed on the boomer generation – but have become much more sophisticated since (even if mind-altering drugs are still a key part of the program, they require opt-in).

            This right here. I was watching a tiny channel on youtube, when I realized all of it- the albums, songs, singers, art, history, and voices discussing the song…were AI. Everything there was written by AI!So apply that to the larger canned narratives. When the FBI types read their own AI-generated narratives, they will believe and act on them, further feeding the learning algorithm, which will generate further narratives…For some years, Zerohedge has reported that the financial headlines are generated by AI, with the automated trading programs executing their trades in response to those headlines, as fully as we believe Holocaust propaganda.We base our values and judgements on it! Our entire civilization’s jurisprudence and direction has been taken over by these creatures’ religious and neoreligious fantasies in a feedback loop.  It’s become its own dialect.

        This video showed up on my YT yesterday. It has all the hallmarks of a GAE production. Extremely slick graphics. Total White erasure in the scenes depicting the military, microchip manufacturing, any other high tech activity. It had the look of something made before Andreesen had made up his mind what horse he would boost in the final quarter. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTWdh1dr4ZI)Then things came up on some Internet search that lead to some Kremlinology that underlies ZMan’s article today.Case I – National Politics:Jacob Helberg appointed by Trump as Under Secretary for Economic Growth Energy and Environment.

Could they at least choose more discreet names for all of this? Her job is to sit on the phone all day and talk to international oligarchs and do a bangup job of negotiation. I bet she is really cracking skulls as they tell her what to tell Newsom to do.Now that the election is over, the depression of all of this is really hitting home. You look at elections at city and state levels all of Europe and South America and the GAE and you have to conclude that somebody was playing both sides of it. 2020 was a second phase of the revolution that made everybody sick and tired of the things that they now are going to have ready made solutions for. It is almost as if 2020-2024 was the easy part. 2024 – ??? is going to be where we see just how organized the international oligarchy really is. We are going to have to not focus on this or it will be way too demoralizing. Focus on local action and then connecting those nodes across the map once you get some traction.We are entering the darkness. One final thought I had is that our former country is a colony. Nothing hit that home than watching interviews with Alex Karp. Not a problem in the world with the goings on from 2008 to 2023 until the line that matters was crossed.The implication is that we need to think of it as a colony. We must build redoubts and keep them as sacred. Then we need to think of the rest of this landmass as a colony. How can we organize and go around and about it and extract from it what is useful to us. I don’t want it to be that way and I know you don’t either. However, we don’t make the rules. We can’t beat them, so we must join them. Put a smile on your face, lie psychopathically to the out-groups and extract what you can from the colony for the betterment of our cause. It is what has been done to us, and the path forward is to turn the tables as best we can.

That oligarchy of monied families does exist, perhaps best evident in the adoption of the Covid Delusion by most of the nations almost simultaneously.  A colony indeed.

        The Deep State arrived fully formed in 1863. Its talons go deep into the body politic and there is no bargaining with it. Americans and most of the world have been swept up in its maniacal energy. It is unstoppable by almost any means short of nuclear annihilation. Either it has its way or it brings down ruin on all of us. It’s out from behind the curtain and no longer even bothers to conceal its contempt for humanity. Ukraine is in everyone’s future.

            At this point, the difference between Tiny Hats and Judeo-Puritans is negligible. The people who don’t fall into these categories, but nonetheless slavishly follow their policies, are mere sycophants. They enjoy the ride their hegemon provides.

        Very informative.It’s a spiritual war.  The Deep State in all its forms — NGOs, bureaucracy, military institutions, etc. — wishes to accomplish its color revolutions of ‘liberal democracy’ around the world.  Problem is, that ain’t the liberal democracy of John Kennedy or D.D. Eisenhower.It’s the liberal democracy of Queen Victoria Noo-land and Barack Obama.‘It has been made infamous for the scenes of Victoria Nuland waddling around Kiev, handing out cookies to the pro-Western protestors.’Cookies.  Exactly.  Vicki and the DS see themselves as On the Side of Goodness and Fluffy Angels.  They’re Mom Inc., a planetary nanny.  They’re there to HELP!New Amerika demands wokeness, feminism, celebrational homosexuality, mass abortion, and all the rest for every nation on the planet.  The DS desires to turn the world into what it’s turned New Amerika into.  It is spawning season for Cthulhu.

            There is debate about the extent to which Jan 6 was an insurrection. I think the people who showed up there did intend to reverse the election, but what is unusual is that they had very little violent intent.
They were so naïve that they thought by merely “petition[ing] the government for a redress of grievances” that the magic of the USA or God or Trump would set things aright.
It was the conservative equivalent of Kent State 1970 when the hippy chicks were putting flowers in the barrels of the National Guard’s guns.

        Over the holidays I read two books about good ol new yawker gangstas. I believe what happened was some of the hoodlums got wise and decided only amateur losers ran from authorities. The real killing was to first buy, then infiltrate, then become the law. The shakedown of the “murder inc” crew, then the war when government suddenly needed killers to watch the New York docks and then the big one, the creation of the CIA, the government s very own Murder Inc. And once you have blackmail and silent killing inside the walls, the experts at that will soon dominate. And that’s what happened

        ” … American foreign policy. The reason for that is much of it is now done off the books, outside the official system.”And, at least in the case of the CIA, it has *always* been done off the books and outside the official system (beginning with the Italian national elections of 1947), as this book explains through *copious* documentation:https://www.alibris.com/Operation-Gladio-The-Unholy-Alliance-Between-the-Vatican-the-CIA-and-the-Mafia-Paul-L-Williams/book/28973726?matches=7I can’t recommend it too highly. It ranges from the reason for the death of Billie Holiday to the true story of the real-life “French connection” to the real reasons for the invasion/occupation of Viet Nam and Afghanistan to the death of Pope John Paul I and the attempted assassination of JPll to the Vatican Bank scandals of the ’70s and the connection of the Masons (naming names) to the murder in London of Italian banker Roberto Calvi–complete with bricks in his coat pockets as the signature of Masonic responsibility for Calvi’s “suicide” (“hanged himself” from the Blackfriars Bridge in London)–to the truth about the Brigate Rossi (the Red Brigades) in Italy and the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany and a great deal more.Fascinating; horrifying; readable.

        It would seem there is nothing to be done.  I suppose most governments are similar to one degree or another, although without the US ability to continually F things up around the world and throw around trillions of dollars they don’t have.

        The double edged sword about this expansive “network” of ngos, intel agencies, and non profits is that no one person or entity is in charge or can be in charge of all of it, or even very much of it. Not only does this insulate it from elected reformers (or anyone at all) trying to redirect, repurpose, or shut it down, it also prevents one node from necessarily being able to trust other nodes. People or entities may take control of this or that portion but no one can control all of it. Nor can one part of this “system” necessarily trust other parts. It is the blob that no one in particular controls.However, that is not to say that it lacks unifying purpose. As we discussed the other day about “journalists” in the msm, so too here there is a long refined curation process for selecting the “talent” at the ngos from the pozzed academy, so that the cogs in the machine arrive pre-indoctrinated. And their unifying principles are sodomy and love for darker skinned people. Making these the unifying principles of GAE foreign policy. You only thought it was incoherent. It always advances those two things. In that order. Sometimes the darkies still get the shaft. But sodomy never does.

            That’s why we call it the swamp or the deep state.It’s so annoying when people scoff at the concept of “Deep State” or “Swamp”  There are only 542 elected officials in DC (not counting DC’s local gov) who allegedly run the leviathan federal government.The very same people who scoff at the entire idea, talk about a part of the Deep State incessantly. Leftists are always whining about the rotations of regulators moving back and forth between the industries they are supposed to be regulating and the industry.

            Over the last half century the academy has done such a thorough job of indoctrinating its inmates that students now arrive as freshmen pre-indoctrinated. The next four years are now spent applying the refinments and finer touches.

        The Deep State achieved self-awareness long ago, but there seems to be a glitch in the system of late. It appears some Deep State factions have achieved individual group self-awareness and they do not necessarily work toward a unified end or goal. We have caught glimpses about this with the varied reactions to the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, to cite one example, and there seems to be an apparent chasm within the “Green” movement recently. Elites seemingly subscribe primarily to one or the other group but it may no longer be possible to be plugged into the disparate factions simultaneously. Hence, the rise of the rogue elites who affiliate with dissident and up and coming factions.The Help and Hos in Congress indeed are clueless but at some point they will notice their pockets are lined by Group X or Group Y but not always both groups. It will be too confusing for them to keep up with whom to primarily serve. This doesn’t directly help us, of course, but we may be inadvertent beneficiaries once factions decide they need to buy us off from time to time in the same way as they do their Pet Senators and Pet House Members.Elite Theory and Academic Agent really got close. The populist delusion is indeed real.

        From ‘The Technological Society’ by Jacques Elul (1964)P.284The Totalitarian State: Finally, technique causes the state to become totalitarian, to absorb the citizens’ life completely. We have noted that this occurs as a result of the accumulation of techniques in the hands of the state. Techniques are mutually engendered and hence interconnected, forming a system that tightly encloses all our activities. When the state takes hold of a single thread of this network of techniques, little by little it draws to itself all the matter and the method, whether or not it consciously wills to do so.Even when the state is resolutely liberal and democratic, it cannot do otherwise than become totalitarian. It becomes so either directly or, as in the United States, through intermediate persons. But, despite differences, all such systems ultimately come to the same result. I shall not repeat these facts since I believe that I have sufficiently emphasized them.Technique engenders totalitarianism by another expedient: its mode of action. Let us take a simple example, that of total war. There has been a theory of total war, and consequently, it would seem, some will and choice in the matter. But the action of techniques nowadays makes war of necessity total. The use of guided missiles such as the V2 weapons and rockets which had an error of about nine miles in three hundred, presupposed that the great majority of them would fall among the civilian population. The same holds for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile: one ICBM is capable of destroying all life over very considerable areas.﻿

        Those who get too curious or refuse to play ball will find themselves with a primary opponent and no money. It is why “our democracy” is a rhetorical and literal fig leaf for the Deep State.When I explained this to my 78 year old mother, she just could not wrap her head around it.  She will not let go of her belief that the system works and it is legitimate.  “Trump” is going to make things right!  He’s going to deport the illegals!”.I love my mother dearly, but no matter how hard I try, I can’t break her of this thinking.

The New Hysteria: The Regime Pivots from Russians to ImmigrantsRyan McMaken
Indeed, it’s likely the regime can barely believe its good fortune on the immigration front. After years of subsidizing migrants with taxpayer dollars to balloon immigrant numbers, the regime will now berewardedwith vast new powers to “solve” the problem.
Conservatards conserve “Progressivism” and the Deep State, too.

            The libertarian combination of near-total insight and near-total wrongness is unique. It pretends to be the opposite, but it’s themax levelof sucking up to power.(Not coincidentally, libertarians are nerds.)The five real Marxists still alive say that too, but they don’t understand. American ideological “identification with capital” (or whatever) isn’t classist, insecure, wishful, nostalgic, etc. It’s sadistic, vengeful.Theone good thingthe incoming admin might possibly do is throw out some Central American criminals. Aztec goblins traversing the continent to rape and rob you on your own government’s payroll?Thatwas fine, not worth talking about. (Note the article’s specific evasion of that, and how it’s phrased.) It’s thebacklash—imperfect self-defense through what libertarianism claims is the only legitimate proxy (“monopoly on violence” etc.)—that’sthe real problem.Nobody is more “blackpilled” on the incoming admin than I am. I expect much worse than that guy does. He’s faking it. Does he know? Is nerd rage truly blinding?

        It is too much to hope that Trump will abandon the “Israel as 51st state” thing but I do have some hope he will back off the regime change/democracy stuff.

            Money can buy a lot of politicians in a place like Serbia. IIRC, one of the first moves by the West after the Balkan wars was to force changes in the local constitutions that allowed these NGO’s to operate freely. This was the heart of the matter in Georgia. The majority party pushed through a change that let the government crack down on foreign actors. It is one reason the West will try to regime change Orban again this year. Hungary has a law banning foreign lobbying and activism.

            The small organizations that try to help decent white Americans would be hit the hardest, by far.  Some small colleges would go under, but HBCUs which already operate under great government subsidy would just be propped up even more.  The worst hit would be K-12 small Christian schools which are currently the best option most families have to escape public education.

            The small hats want you to think it’s just about the shekels (ala Mike Medved), but the money is only useful to the extent it buys influence/compliance.  What matters is power, and that is more a function of deep and extensive connections to all the different nodes of power and influence.  And those are all connected by ethnic and marital and financial ties which are global.   And all that goes back centuries.

Mercedes-Benz swerves aggressively through crowd of cyclists blocking L.A. street
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8IQ18SB1hY
The bicyclists taking over the street, the Benz driver taking the situation into his own hands, and then the coupe de grace, the bicyclists vandalizing the Benz in a parking garage. The level of self-centeredness is dumbfounding.
It’s an early 2000’s C-Class so nothing high-end.

        The American government operates like an onion, with many levels to it. Tocqueville famously said that Americans are a nation of organization starters. In the foreign policy landscape there is a role for everyone from the State Department to think tanks. Speaking of think tanks, what a cushy sinecure that must be! You get a well-paying job in an academic world that touches directly on the real world. Based on your work as a policy work, you get some input into the downstream decisions that flow from Washington to the world. The only thing about think tanks that surprises me is that there aren’t feminist think tanks shrilly urging change on behalf of their “sisters” in Muslim countries, including military force if necessary. Now that would be a horror.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
