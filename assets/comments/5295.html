        Reading theTreason of the Clerks right now. It covers this ground well. The thesis is that it is not the sleep of reason that brings forth monsters but rather reason in the service of various -isms. When thinkers stop pursuing universal truths and warp reason in the service of some ideology or another, then only bloodshed will result.

        Z….this post and the one on “math” are just about all a person needs to understand modern politics. I don’t know why they haven’t got much in the way of comments, but they are spot on. Watching the studied indifference of politicians to our declining finances, watching the reaction of the gop, and the Nat rev bunch to trump (whom I despise) tells me that there isn’t much point to my being a republican anymore. Well, it’s going to be a bumpy night I guess. Tim

        Conservatives’ unwillingness to lead or even to make the case for why conservatism is better than leftism has left a moral and intellectual vacuum the Left was only too willing to fill with its degradations disguised as human “progress”. Conservatives understood too late that controlling the educational institutions was the ticket to the whole show, and allowed the Left to rampage it’s way from K through college.“Education is a weapon, whose effect depends on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed.” — Joseph Stalin“Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.” — LeninAnd generations in this country have borne the bitter fruit.
