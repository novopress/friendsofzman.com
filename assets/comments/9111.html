        Thank you for this article, which is spot on. In the Adam Smithian sense, free trade between nations is driven by natural competitive advantages. The French climate is great for grapes and the English climate is great for barley and hops, so trading French wine for English beer makes perfect economic sense. Similarly, trading Mexican tequila for Canadian maple syrup makes perfect economic sense.In the modern corporate economy most free trade is simply tax, wage and regulatory arbitrage. Taiwan, Singapore, and China have no natural competitive advantages in making semiconductor materials and/or electronics. Globalist companies flock there only due to tax, wage, and regulatory arbitrage.I’ve had many a conversation over the last thirty years with highly credentialed professionals and policy drivers who can’t grasp (or won’t admit) this distinction. Hence, President Trump.

Of course they do, they sit closer to their work (Dudley Moore in Crazy People).

        I spent the better part of election season arguing with a close Canadian friend. Canadians have these neuroses from being a smaller, weaker country that’s very closely tied to a large powerful neighbor. She was worried about what a Trump election would do to Canada’s trade deals with the USA.She didn’t believe me that most Americans have no idea that NAFTA involves Canada and beyond that, don’t care. They think of Canada as kind of like Minnesota and aren’t really bothered by free trade with another Anglosphere country with comparable wages and standard of living and laws. She was sure that dumping NAFTA would be a disaster for Canada and was surprised when Trudeau basically said it looked like American-Canadian trade deals would remain basically unchanged in practice.

        Z Man;I did business in Asia for US companies in the late ’80’s and early-mid ’90’s and can vouch for everything you say.  In addition to stealing intellectual property there are numerous non-terriff barriers.  Japan was particularly good at this, using regulatory subterfuge.A too-good-to-check but indicative story current at the time: The Ministry of Trade became concerned that Japanese were hurting the trade balance by buying too much French wine.  So they contacted the Ministry of Agriculture who issued a regulation that on account of adulteration of European wine (actually it was Italy) and concern for the health of the Japanese people they’d have to sample one bottle of wine in every case for contamination.  This would mean that every case box had to be broken open upon arrival.  Plus who’s to say what qualifies as contamination.The French being more wily than us supposedly replied that they too were concerned about the health of the French people and that since there was evidence of dangerous radiation being produced by Japanese TV’s (CRT at the time), they were going to install an inspection system located in Limoges.  But not to worry about throughput, they would put 2 inspectors on the job.  This meant that EVERY set would have to got to Limoges before it could be sold.At this the Japanese reconsidered and said that maybe they could test a random few bottles of wine at their point of origin.  The French likewise said that they’d be content to check a few random sets at point of origin.  Message sent and received_!

            Purely by luck in those pre-Internet days, I was able to follow the whole amorphous transformer core travesty from development by US firms to Japanese non-tariff barrier (we must take time to examine the effects of this new technology on our electric grid) to Japanese industry being completely spun up and selling them at “competitive” prices.  I saw much more closely and personally the whole 802.11c fiasco (our residences are so close together, normal WiFi won’t work here).  This time it was a fiasco for them.  The rest of the world moved out without them.  That was the beginning of the end for their electronic industry.

        I’d like to point out that the environmental maladies of the Emerald Ash Borer, Zebra Mussel, Chestnut Blight, Grass Carp, and numerous others are all due to ignoring or actively side-stepping agricultural import and customs regulations by our trade “partners”.

        “The unemployed car battery worker is not taking up a self-actualizing career at the George Mason economics department.”
But wasn’t that what Bill Clinton promised us when he helped China get admitted to the WTO? Weren’t we supposed to get all of the nasty, greasy, dirty manufacturing jobs, and all become computer programers and rocket scientists and neurosurgeons instead? What gives? Were we just out and out  lied to from the git go on this whole free free trade deal?

            It’s the same BS as “everyone is entitled to a college education” whether it is the correct thing for them.  People buy this shit as if a piece of paper is going to magically get them into the job of their dreams when everything is being magically dumbed down and winds up being worthless except for the debt load.

        There is no such thing as free trade, because trade or anything involving economics is never free from politics. This is something the right wing and libertarians who view economics from a theoretical/ideological perspective miss. What is good in theory for economics is often bad politics, and what would be best is often something politics will not allow. There are always compromises. Ideological true believers in free trade turn a blind eye to the other side of the table playing politics and serving their own interests.Another problem is only looking at the big picture. If the whole economy grows but 30% of the people get screwed that is bad politics and bad in general. This is generally true regardless of the numbers involved. This is the situation we currently find ourselves in. The economy is supposedly growing, but all of the gains are going to the financial class while the rest of us are getting screwed.The sales pitch for free trade was that the jobs lost to other countries would be replaced by equal or better jobs. This hasn’t happened in real life. The free traders were wrong and we shouldn’t trust what they say anymore. Broad based prosperity should be the goal of politics. Having a good job and supporting yourself what should happen, and what a lot of people want. No amount of governement cheese will make up for the lack of that. Supporting yourself gives moral satisfaction. Living off the government teat ruins people. Also, when I see these sales pitches, they seem to be directing most of the job gains to the educated. Not everybody is suited to college, some peoplere best suited to work with their hands and they should get the same respect and consideration. Right now, they don’t.

            It’s the same thing they do on a regional level, when they shut down industries. They shut down logging due to the National Scenic Act in the Columbia River Gorge. They said that there would be lots of new industries to take the place of it. What you get is tourism and the low paying jobs that come with it. The development still comes, but only seems to enrich a few well placed folks. And housing costs double.  We truly need to get the Federal government out of the state’s business and make job growth a major consideration for everything.

        Free trade in the abstract works just fine for everyone. The problem is that we don’t live in an abstract world. What is called free trade and what we tend to refer to as “the free market” don’t exist at all. They aren’t free because the governments, both foreign and domestic, set ground rules for commerce that distort those markets, and those ground rules are subject to continual change. Thus our “free markets” are really markets in rent seeking. And the best rent seekers tilt the field in their direction by buying off the politicians that set those ground rules. Thus, making a pretense that we somehow enjoy the benefits of “free markets” allows even worse shenanigans to go on than would if the reality of the situation was recognized and policy set accordingly. This is what Trump recognizes. As a consequence he has set goals for international trade in which the benefits to the economy and the American workers are balanced against the abstract benefits of more open markets that are recognized as not being free, but are in all circumstances regulated.

            The difference between Trump and Bush or Obama is this. Trump is proud of what he has done for Americans. Bush is proud of what he did for foreigners. Trump wants Americans to cheer him for doing good things as president for Americans. Bush wants Americans to cheer him for all the good things he has done for foreigners. Trump thinks like a leader, while Bush thinks like a missionary.

                Having had missionaries for parents I can say that this is true. In my case more for my Dad than my mom. It’s also how progressives and liberals think, too.  Dickens really nailed the personality with Mrs Jellybelly in Bleak House. Caring more about some African tribe than about her own neighbors and family. Charity begins at home.

        I don’t know the details of the Trump deal to save jobs at Carrier.  Sometimes these sorts of things give up tax revenues just to defer the inevitable.  But the symbolism of the whole thing is very powerful.  I am enjoying the heck out of seeing so many irrational assumptions about how things “are” and “must be” simply destroyed.  To think that we might actually see people in charge that have our own national and community best interests at heart, rather than first and foremost feeding at the Washington DC trough that sends our economy and society down the tubes as part of the process, is an exhilarating thing.  It has been a long, long time since I have been optimistic about the general direction of things.  It is a nice warm feeling.

            It is exhilarating!  I think that’s the real reason why Black Friday shopping was strong this year.  I’d add the stock market rising too, but I no longer consider that any real indicator of economic strength; what makes it go up and down is completely incomprehensible now.  In fact, nothing has really changed since Trump was elected.  But I have the feeling that Americans are finally coming out of the defensive crouch they’ve been in the 8 years.  There’s just a feeling that things are getting better, even if nobody can quite know how.

        Isn’t it interesting that in the post-WW2 years, as Japan rebuilt its economy, that US consumers would soon come to know the names of many, many Japanese brands:  Sony, Honda, Toyota, Toshiba, etc. South Korea’s Kia and Samsung eventually followed.Now compare that with China:  China has, since the 1980s, become a global economic juggernaut, but can you name one Chinese brand that has become a household word in the west?  You can’t, because there aren’t any.  And once you think about it, doesn’t that seem a little odd?Alibaba is probably the best known Chinese company name in the west, but have you or has anyone you know every used Alibaba’s services?  The answer is almost guaranteed to be “no.”This is by design. As Z observes, there are no corporations in China truly independent of the CCP and the PLA.  The last thing the Chinese government desires would be for a Chinese corporation to have an identifiable and independent brand identity in the global marketplace, because such a corporation would be in a position to resist the demands of the Chinese government, or if those demands became too extreme, to simply relocate their business elsewhere.  As the article linked above illustrates, the impetus behind China’s astonishing economic transformation since the Maoist era was formed of the desire to enrich and serve the interests of the CCP, not to create a consumer society in China.

            Having a lot of independent, global, branded companies does not fit well with the Confucian ethos either.
The first Chicom company I ever heard of was Norinco.  Some genius in the PLA figured out that he could get rich selling gweilos AK pattern rifles and crappy ammo. I’m sure quite a few PLA generals retired in luxury off their enemies.

            Just a little update from today’s financial news:
Headline: China Losing Control? PBOC Imposes New Yuan Outflow Limits For First Time In Two Decades.
…Then, overnight, the PBOC added a fourth unique form of “capital control” when China’s central bank announced it would limit the amount of renminbi that Chinese companies and individuals can remit outside the country, “imposing a cap for the first time in more than two decades”, according to the SCMP, to stem the yuan’s outflow as the currency plumbs daily lows.”
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-01/china-losing-control-pboc-imposes-new-yuan-outflows-limits-first-time-two-decades
A fairly stunning development.

        The beautiful people prefer outsourcing manufacturing for the same reason that they prefer killing bad guys in drone strikes to housing them in Gitmo–it’s less icky. And so what if a few million deplorables join the unworking class, let them eat government cake and become clients. The middle class has held the Utopians back far too long. California has shown the way, be wealthy or be poor. Like Mexico. And who rules Mexico, or Cuba for that matter? White people, top to bottom. That is the Progressive Oz.–Bastiat–Whence does the state draw those resources that it is urged to dispense to individuals? Is it not from the individuals themselves? How, then, can these resources be increased by passing them through the hands of a parasitical and voracious intermediary?

        Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the price. It is a trade that profits by exploiting the price differences of identical or similar financial instruments on different markets or in different forms.
Now get this bit.
Arbitrage provides a mechanism to ensure prices do not deviate substantially from fair value for long periods of time. With advancements in technology, it has become extremely difficult to profit from pricing errors in the market.
This is the hammer that is leveling wages globally.

            I’m instinctively put off by a general wealth tax, which would include real and personal property as I understand it. I’ve been pondering off and on for years how to rope in those who accumulate wealth by what I call manipulation (i.e. what the Soros types do) and those who accumulate wealth by creating tangible goods and services. That’s pretty rough, but it’s as far as I’ve gotten.

            I keep telling my husband that I’d audit all the cast of Hamilton. Yes, let’s tax some of the folks that have managed to avoid it. Let’s tax non-profits and foundations. Let’s tax universities for their endowments. Let’s get rid of the Hollywood tax benefits that Glenn Reynolds mentions, the ones that date back to the 50s. I’m not in favor of taking everyone off the tax rolls. The unemployed pay taxes on their benefits. Paying taxes makes you reluctant to hand out more “free stuff”.

                Imagine the foolishness, the weird classifications and strange arbitrages, that would disappear if we eliminated the “income” tax.
For instance, women could do womanly things, instead of being “empowered” to pay income taxes- saturating the labor market so husbands are less valuable.
Legal protections- the right of any citizen- are another matter.  Being broke, robbed, screwed, and beat up is cause for complaint.
I meant this as just one example of the cultural mutations caused by the State’s claim on us all.  Who is the State?

                            Not offended,alzaebo. The effects of women’s suffrage are clear,worldwide. Married women,with a rational male partner,tend to vote more conservatively than single women. The Left saw this decades ago,it’s behind the push to get girls into college,put off marriage,get that degree. On the surface it seems plausible,but the reality is that girls do not generally choose the tough courses,STEM, they gravitate to the ones they are better at:social sciences,humanities,etc.  Think Sandra Fluck,or any magenta haired lesbo slam poetess. I know this is a generalization of a complex issue,but refusing to see or discuss the issue is kind of silly and childish. Just like the Special Snowflakes filling college campuses,demanding their safe spaces from the Real World.  Who begat these morons? My guess is,people who look and act like Bo Bergdahl’s parents.  Good grief.

                Unemployment benefits are taxes; that is, taxes are the source of those benefits, the ” insurance ” name notwithstanding. Why should this money be tax two or three or five or seven times? That becomes an exercise in silliness. The unemployed still pay sales taxes. Should Soros and the Clintons pay taxes on their ill-gotten gains? Yes, but taxing taxes won’t fix that. I doubt the husband and father who lost a job in the coal industry thanks to Obama and sees whatever benefits he now has being taxed will find the philosophical question of Soros’ tax avoidance a high priority.As for paying taxes making you reluctant to hand out more free stuff, well, not everyone understands TINSTAAFL.

                    ” Should Soros and the Clintons pay taxes on their ill-gotten gains”Well, why can’t those illegal gains be seized, rather than taxed?[from heritage.org]: Civil Asset Forfeiture is a legal tool that allows law enforcement officials to seize property that they assert has been involved in certain criminal activity. In fact, the owner of the property doesn’t even need to be guilty of a crime: Civil asset forfeiture proceedings charge the property itself with involvement in a crime. This means that police can seize your car, home, money, or [SO-CALLED CHARITABLE FUND, LIKE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION] without ever having to charge you with a crime.Last time I looked, bribery was a crime. Global scale bribery of the sort that the Clintons may have been involved in certainly seems to illlegal, even if it can’t be proveen to be TREASONOUS.

            At a minimum, since the Congress seems to be intent on removing the ability to utilize stretch IRAs for we deplorables (including Roth IRAs), can we at least eliminate the tax dodge of perpetual charitable foundations (Ford, Rockefeller, Pew   etc.) which seem to always morph into leftest activist groups.  Make them close-up-shop 5 years after the death of the founder as well.

        thezman: I noticed that your blog doesn’t have a “favicon”, but that you do have a disqus icon.
So why not simply reuse the later for the former?

How to:
“Since WordPress 4.3, you can add a favicon or site icon from WordPress admin area. Simply go to Appearance » Customize and click on the ‘Site Identity’ tab.”
or “Go to Administration Screen &gt; Appearance &gt; Customize Click Site Identify “
