        You aver that “The demand for incompetent technical people with a vagina or brown skin is zero.” To the contrary, companies like IBM, HP etc are rapidly laying off their most competent people in favor of brown incompetents (often with vaginas). They may not know anything, but most of them will “work” like dogs for cheap. If sheer non-directed hyperactivity can solve a problem, they have the solution. These replacements for deep skill sets and broad knowledge can dither at warp speed, which is apparently enough to delude management that something must be happening.

        Do you want someone from one of these dumbed-down courses involved in applications where lives could be at stake? I sure as hell don’t.
