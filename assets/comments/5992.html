        I found you through either Ace of Spades or iSteve, I can’t remember which, and you actually inspired me to start my own (far inferior) blog. I usually post under a pseudonym (it’s complicated), but I might as well post this under my own name.I work for a newspaper — a dying profession, but we hang on because we’re in a market with tons of elderly retirees who are scared of the Internet. As part of my duties, I read a lot of reader mail. One of the things I noticed when I first started at our paper was that I thought our retired readers made a lot of great points, but they had difficulty expressing themselves in a coherent fashion.Your blog is like the complete opposite of that. As I said to my wife: “It’s like this guy is one of our cranky regular letter writers, except he’s a literal freaking genius who is way, WAY smarter than me. Instead of reading him and thinking, ‘that’s a good point, but I could have phrased it better,’ I find myself thinking, ‘damn, that’s brilliant. Why didn’t I ever look at it that way?&#x27;”

        I don’t remember which site initially linked me to your page, but it doesn’t really matter. You are one of my daily reads.
Thank you for the effort you put in here.

        “Strangely, I get very little Canadian traffic”
Canada just seems to be completely whipped. I have yet to meet a Canadian I would classify as conservative. I’m sure they exist but where are they?

        Greatly enjoy your work, check the feed every day when online, agree with you in large measure (certainly one reason I like the blog!) and wonder if there are any other readers from Argentina.
Keep up the good work!

        Hey, Z-Man, nightly reader here in Ottawa. Send link regularly to 4 or 5 trusted confederates this side of your northern border. Particularly relish your insights into forgotten (by most) wars and their parallels to our present, parlous times.

        You write a hellava piece, Z man – that’s why your word of mouth has been so good.  That, and because you offer a perspective that readers can’t find at the NYT, WaPo, or even the websites of the “mainstream right” likeThe National Review.As for your traffic coming from outside the US, well, numbers don’t lie:UK Population: approx. 65 millionCanada Pop.:   approx. 35 millionAnd a number of Canadians’ first language is not English, so the ratio of British to Canadian readers will be still more pronounced. In any case, I just cannot imagine that our neighbors to the North are more drunk than the Brits.**The USA isn’t Saudi Arabia, but we’restilltoo puritanical to be in the running for drunkest English-speaking country.

        I discovered your site only this year. After being linked here from American Digest (I believe), the first order of business was to devour all of your back posts. A million words is a lot, but I wish that you wrote more frequently and at greater length. Accordingly, I check the site daily to see if there’s anything new. I also read the comments, some of which are quite informative.Thanks for writing your thoughts down. You don’t owe me or anyone else fresh copy and you’re under no obligation to share your thinking with the world, but I’m glad that you feel like taking the trouble.Cheers, RW

        It is difficult to find work that consistently challenges one’s thinking, and does so in a way that shines a bit of a different light on things than most other places.  There is also the matter of the added insights of the comments.  This site excels in both areas, and is one of my few political/social daily go-to sites.  You may not change the world (I hope you do), but I always feel a bit more informed after each visit.  I imagine that putting your own thoughts into writing clarifies and sharpens your own thinking. Thank you!

        On the other hand, a five thousand word essay which is expressed in a one thousand word essay may be an improved essay.
The money shots in the Great Books of politics and such are doled out by paragraph, sometimes two or three. When the melody is strong people will grasp it without preamble. It may even drive them to read the book.
