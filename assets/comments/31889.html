                Zuckerberg and his cronies manufactured about 10 million votes in 2020 via falsified mail-in ballots. They will likely have to double that total in 2024 in order to reelect the pants-shitter.

        Roosh V left the entire movement and is now an Orthodox Christian ; I should also say Vox Day is thriving as both comics and books are doing exceptionally well. One thing i notice now is the social sexual hierarchy and it shows up clearly in the comments as to your status.

        Didn’t know where this goes because it applies to so many threads, so here made sense.If all a woman is looking for is a bad boy, she’s just a variant on a mudshark. Stay away. Unless its the best you can do, I guess, and if that’s the case maybe consider playing for the other team. At least do us the rest of us the favor of not spawning more “mudsharks” from her genes.Women worth having are complex, but share two major characteristics, and you must satisfy both. Security and submission. She wants to know that all her material needs are met, and will be met in the future, and that her children’s needs will also always be met. That you will always be there for her and her kids. And she needs to let her hair down in private and get the feeling of danger, even when she knows to her very core that she is perfectly safe in your hands.The reason women hate betas is betas can never satisfy either need. Your ambition to eventually work your way up to a cubicle on the third floor does not give her the security she wants. And if you are not capable of great violence, you are harmless, failing in both key needs.\A good woman doesn’t necessarily need you to succeed in fulfilling those desires, BTW. She just needs to have you never give up trying. If you are not in the best shape of your life, what are you waiting for? And if you are, improve. If you don’t have a corner office, and plans to move into the penthouse office, what are you doing now to make that a reality? Do you at least have those aspirations?

            The only thing I think I probably misstated is that by “danger” I don’t mean (necessarily) physical danger, but simply the danger that all people feel having their (perceived) inadequacies exposed to the world.
It doesn’t matter whether we are talking about her body, or her intellect, or whatever, your task as a man is that if you take that on, you help her become the person she wants to be.
If you have to take a woman, you are slime. You need to deny yourself, even to the point of saying, “Tomorrow, babe, if you still feel that way.”

                And, though because of this format, few follow beyond a day (maybe a couple days on the weekend), the whole idea of “what is good for white people” cannot be ignored. Either you are someone who is committed to the preservation of that which is good, i.e., white virtue, or you are not.
The PUA is no different than the nogger, who seeks the destruction of white virtue.
If you downvote, ask yourself why.

        Reading through the comment section I had a few more thoughts on the people involved in this stuff.  One thing that struck me was the severe cringe of the remaining true believers, what might have once enthralled a horny 20 year old now just sounds like the same insecure bragging of any pathetic middle-aged man.  I remember boomers lying about how much sex they had in the 60s and now it’s gen x lying about how much sex they had in the 90s and xennials lying about how much sex they had in the 2000s.  (I remember back in those days I had an onion on my belt which was the fashion at the time, and I’d just go up to random women in the street and seduce them and take them to a gross-out comedy movie.  Oh hollywood had real glamour back in those days, after watching a Jewish man pretending to be a teenager masturbate with an apple pie these ladies would be horned up something fierce I’ll tell you what…)The men’s rights side of things was at least not clownish like the game side, and one definitely feels for these guys and their horror stories of marriage.  But in the end were these men we should have been listening to?  Bitter men only presenting the worst possible outcomes of relationship as if it was the standard.  It’s the same trap the feminists fell into, they let the lesbians and their bad attitudes drive the train to spinsterville.The common factor between the two was taking the libertarian individualist mindset down to the absolute atomic level of the lone person and completely eschewing the pair bonding that’s been the mainstay of civilization for thousands of years.  In a traditional society a man dressed like a peacock running around like a gigolo would have been murdered by the other males.  The most salient point is that none of this stuff results in white babies.

            Agreed, though I have no clue about some of your references. Onion?What strikes me about all the horror stories is the Forrest Gumpish, “And then for no reason at all, she filed for divorce and took half my shit.” No, there was a reason. Either you chose poorly, or you weren’t keeping her needs satisfied. So long as you didn’t somehow fall for a complete psychopath, she is not going to let a real catch slip through her fingers. And if she is a complete psychopath, breathe a sigh of relief and promise yourself to choose more wisely in the future.In any event, your first step needs to be looking in the mirror with the most critical eye you can muster up. It’s hard, I know. I could have been “that guy” but for one friend who slapped me upside the head with a dead fish.

            Americans are really big on the whole “rugged individualist” thing for whatever reason, so it’s easy to get us to buy into the atomization even though we are member of an very social species.
Reality is somewhere between the Marlboro Man idiocy and the “it takes a village” idiocy, but I don’t expect most Amercians to grasp that before we are each dealt with individually.

            Yeah, hookup culture made a mess of dating. Lots of manipulation involving sex on both sides. You’d end up sleeping around looking for someone to marry, which made bonding difficult. Cart before the horse, a lot of people got crushed. Personally, I went through it a couple of times and got the shits of it, but that was the reality you had to accept if you didn’t want to be single. People cope. Bragging, PUA, MGTOW, feminism— all cope.

        For the record… The “red pill” is nothing new. It’s ages old masculine knowledge. I’ll sight William Shakespeare’s how to deal with a bitchy woman tour de force “The Taming of the Shrew,” and works by Arthur Schopenhauer as proof that what we know call the red pill is in fact what used to pass for common male knowledge. “Women love assholes.”

        BTW Z… Don’t be a hypocrite!I’ve been a fan of your writing since your Takimag days. Do you not, although humbly ask for donations to support your work? They don’t “accept  listener enthusiasm at the bank” I don’t classify you as a grifter for asking for donations so you can afford the time and money to provide the great material you provide.  I’m sure there are many ppl out there who don’t appreciate or see the value in your work who would equally consider you a grifter.If a guy like Rollo Tomassi “George Miller,” or Captain Capitalism “Aaron Cleary,” put the time and effort into writing seminal works like Rollo’s Ratiional Male series, or Cleary’s Enjoy the Decline, should they not make some money off of their work? You know the time and effort you put into your work and that time and effort could have been used to make money doing something else. A lot of these guys put their work out for free for years on forums and blogs, before they wrote books or showed up on YouTube. Now you have a host of influencer wanna be grifters, regurgitating the material the three R’s Rollo, Roisy and Rooshe and a host of others used to provide for free decades ago and are grifting off of the guys who did the leg work mostly for free. Those guys Tate included are the true grifters.

        You’re fucking A right on the men’s “fashion” Z. All these hipster dudes walking around in berkenstocks / sandles with socks, always a freakin hoodie, hood up mind you in 90 degree heat. Cargo shorts with hoodie and a parka in a Buffalo blizzard, often with sandles / crocks.A guy who I trusted to do my tires without destroying my wheels told me he’s also a pastor of some Christian sect. He did a wedding held in a park, with the bride and groom attired in pajamas, robes and slippers. How fucking bizarre is that!Men do need to fine tune their look from time to time. Example, skinny ties in the 60’s, wide ties in the 70’s, back to skinny in the 80’s. We’ve seemed to settle in to medium width ties. Even as a guy who wears a tie maybe twice a year, I’m aware of this men’s fashion faux pas. Look how flannel shirts keep coming and going.But the classics always come back around. A well worn pair of Levi’s never goes out of style.

        Do you know what it means to be a man? It is to take what you want and destroy the opposition. It is violence and chicanery in its highest forms.It is easy to settle for one female in a monogamous relationship. It is easy to pick up the black-as-a-negro spatula and start barbecuing. It is easy to go to work 9 to 5 and punch in a time clock.Try being charming enough to seduce a woman and have her support you, as I have, on more than one occasion. Oh, that’s right, it isn’t manly to have her pay the bills, even if you are the one holding the whip hand. ✋Only white alpha males should have the right to vote. That would solve all our problems in a jiffy.— Xloveli (www.dark.sport.blog)

            Having women support grown men is how that other demographic does thing. To the extent that it basically seems baked in their cake. In Africa, the women work the fields while the men sit around under the baobob tree and drink fermented gruel or chew khat.White men DO things. We accomplish, we work, we invent, we strategize and execute war plans, and we are driven to it like a spring inside us. When it’s time to court a woman, we do that. When we’re in our stride, we don’t really have to do much in that regard, since the women (when they’re not mentally sickened as in the current era) are naturally attracted to this natural energy, and do much of the choosing of us before we even become of aware of them.We certainly don’t devote our precious time to “chicanery” or running con games in marketplace, sexual or financial. That’s the ugly remit of our parasites.

                    In my worst times, such as during a particularly bad jobless period in 2009 and the recession, she certainly did carry my unemployed carcass for months. It’s certainly not something I brag about.
You are seriously contending that the ability to hypnotize females into paying a man’s way in life is something worthy of respect, rather than the derision it’s going to get here?

        Heartiste 💓 was a great man. His comments room at Chateau Heartiste was different from Zman’s channel.Whereas the Chateau was about 80% alpha/alpha wannabes and 20% beta simps, Zman’s hollows are filled with 80% betas, and many of the scarce Alphas are refugees from WordPress’s lethal and final censorship of Chateau Heartiste.The betas here have this strange idea that if a man knocks up a piece of ass, he should spend 18 years slaving away to support her little rugrat. They think “Manning up” means taking responsibility, when it really is a euphemism for societal control. A lot of them seem to like mustaches.Just one more point: a commenter here said the alpha pick up artist ends up saying “yes dear” when his wife tells him to do the dishes. My response: Just because you’re a pussy doesn’t make every man one. I had a relationship for 3 years where my bitch was a good bitch and did exactly what I told her. That’s the real world for some, buddy.— Xloveli (www.dark.sport.blog)

            You’re new here, so some slack is appropriate.
FWIW, I’m approaching 7 decades on the planet and can still ride a mountain bike across 20 miles of singletrack up and over a mountain pass at 10,000 feet and do then it again the next day if I choose. I’ve yet to find a riding partner (of any age) that can keep up. You’re welcome to join me here in the Central Rockies any time. Alpha is as alpha does.

            Men who refer to women that way come across as try-hard and bitter, especially when talking about a woman they’ve been in a relationship with.

        The Manosphere never got much love here, I truly believe this is a generational thing. Z’s audience skews Boomer, simple as. So the absolute shitshow that was dating in the mid 00s up to present day was basically lost on them. It was late Xers and Millennials who were really feeling the effects of the destruction of the social contract in full. Divorce court rape, the rise of social media, beta thirst/simping, and the complete abdication of responsibility by women. All brought to you in large part, by (((radical feminism))).So when these group of men started to compare stories through the magic of the internet it was enlightening to hear so many similar tales. It was also a place, like Z’s place, where people could go to speak with the like-minded and realize they were not crazy and it was extreme gaslighting they were experiencing.It makes me sad that so many here have such a poor understanding of the Manosphere as basically “PUAs”, yeah, that was –part– of it. But hardly all of it. Like most things in life, complexity &amp; nuance are a real thing, and that includes the Manosphere which was a web of different ideologies loosely connected. There were certainly goofy grifters / scammers but there was also some really good advice for young men attempting to navigate the absolute shitshow / minefield that was modern dating &amp; relationships.Heartiste however, stands as a towering giant amongst the rest. You needn’t go farther than his archives to see this. This guy had a rapier wit, razor sharp, in addition to deep &amp; profound insights into the human psyche, the effects of globohomo, etc. He was at -least- as capable of a writer as our esteemed Z-Man, and as a dark comedian exceeded him in many ways. I say this as high praise to both Z and Heartiste as they were the only ones who could hold my attention for any length of time.That is why when Heartiste was removed, which was an inevitability as he shifted his focus more &amp; more from socio-sexual issues to (((other bigger problems))) and his profile got too high, I decamped to Z forum. He use to link to Z with some frequency so I always made a mental note that the quality of the writing and the commentariat was “up to par” and it would be my new home if the inevitable happened.I know we have some serious Heartiste vets here- Whiskey, fakeeemail, Pozy, Bourbon, many others. I’m glad for their presence. I was a prolific contribute at Heartiste and even an occasional guest writer there so I simply cannot say anything bad about the guy.My unsolicited (and long) .02₵Apex Predator AKA “Jay in DC” (for many years at CH)

            Great comment!  Yes, you had to be there to truly understand the Manosphere.  Any man trying to date in the 90s thru the 00s knows what a confusing shit show it was and was struggling to put the pieces together of why it was like that way.  It lead utterly clueless men coming together to understand feminism, the nature of women, to. . .many other things.Boomers will NEVER understand.  They came of age, dated, got jobs, in a still sane and basically wholesome and sane country.  We did NOT.   So of course even the most based boomer will say something stupid like the Manosphere was about “hating women”; the exact same thing a feminist says if a man says he’s hates feminism.I personally found Heartiste after reading the lamentation of gym killer/incel George Sodini.  What he wrote was so scarily emotional and articulate.  Heartiste did not wave him off as “crazy” like the mass media.  He explained what it meant and how NOT to wind up like George.Roissy lead me to Strauss/Mystery which lead to a Tyler workshop and I even went back and looked at Eric Webber and Ross Jeffries.  All of this eventually lead to me dealing with accepting my failings and misunderstandings with women and in life.  I turned it all around and now have done pretty good for myself all things considered.Long live the manosphere!

            Apex:  Agree.  I never commented at Heartiste, but I read – and I learned a lot about myself, women in general, and the nature, wants, and needs of men.  Also agree that Zman’s audience skews Boomer – and more so of late than when I first started reading here.  And it now seems normiecons and cuckservatards are coming out of the woodwork, wanting to share their latest color-blind enlightenment ‘insight.’  I suppose all good things come to an end.

            Agreed. Whatever social milieu Z was dealing with in terms of sexual and romantic relationships, it definitely differed from the experience of later Gen X, Millennial, and subsequent. Maybe some of the women he interacted with were infected with the modern female mind virus, but clearly, not all of them (as they all are today)–which meant he has a classic viewpoint on these things. That’s as Boomerish as asking why young people don’t just buy a house.The PUA stuff, in its best form, was a godsend. It’s really just applied social theory, and, it works. It can be a dangerous thing for the wrong people to embrace, though, and it shouldn’t HAVE to be used, in a sane society.

            “This guy had a rapier wit, razor sharp, in addition to deep &amp; profound insights into the human psyche, the effects of globohomo, etc.”Indeed, there is a massive audience left to wonder the empty and shallow net in limbo. Yes, there were grifters, schitzos and wannabe players, but I think every criticism of the manoshpere misses the point. The so called ‘men’ back in the day have allowed the feminization of our culture, institutions and morals. If having ‘game’ is such a schoolboy act, then why is it so effective in dealing with not only women but men and mixed groups? Infact, the more subtle and suave tactics of an aloof asshole work on anything from job interviews to standing up for yourself even when outnumbered, because you know you’re not outgunned. The young white men of the west have been given shit advice and treated even worse. Of course it’s part of life to get ur shit kicked in and have to deal with unfair circumstances, but none of the older dudes ever gave advice that actually worked on women, they never seemed to be capable of saying ‘no’ to their wives, daughters or karen’s. So here we are, divided in a niche corner of the internet fighting for the remaining scraps of discourse on how to live in clown world. I think the focus should be on practical advice and strategies that give results. I understand the importance of finding a traditional outcome for our society in the long run, but the village has abandoned the young men with such viscious resentment we no longer feel the need to be part of it. Chateau Heartiste did not offer a solution to societies problems, just the truth for the individual to understand and use to their advantage. Nature has no remorse for losers, so maybe let’s win first and then ask how we should organize our civilization.

So long as “results” means something compatible with morality and tradition, sure. If “results” means nothing more than carving another notch in your bedpost, you are part of the problem.

        It took  tons of blather to finally figure out the life-changing message:
Women look for a man who isn’t afraid of them.
Women, men, an audience.  It’s that simple.That’s magnetism.  That’s confidence.
Even though I’ve been arounds hundreds of women, and have no fear of crowds, I was never *that guy*.I couldn’t read the signals.  Now, because of that one line that I had to come up with, it just comes automatically with people.  Many can do it but they can’t say how.Heartiste changed my life.

                        PUA encompasses a whole spectrum, or series of spectrums, which includes vile, base degeneracy right on up to virtuous wife-seeking. As water finds its own level, so will the hopeful pick up acolyte find his natural place on that map. Like any powerful tool, from a hammer to a machine gun, it can do great good or great harm.But I’m done flacking on behalf of pick up artistry for today. Final thing I’ll say is that it helped me understand the nature of women, as well as the nature of myself and men, and to frame that into saving my marriage at a time it was in serious danger of falling to pieces. I didn’t turn into a PUA, but I read their tomes and gleaned the wisdom and insight that nobody else had the guts to write down.

            Alzaebo: “Women look for a man who isn’t afraid of them.”Here I’m gonna hafta disagree.It took me a long, long time to realize what was happening, but sometime in the last several decades, ambitious women began to see themselves as Ladies MacBeth, preferring Beta husbands, about whose gonads they could attach psychological BDSM testicle rings, tethered by psychological chains in their hands.The Neo-Lady-MacBeth is the hidden lurking curse of the 21st Century dating scene.Ambitious women of the 21st Century do NOT want to be eye candy on an Alpha’s elbow; they want to rule the roost.And they have the entire edifice of the (((Lawfare Industrial Complex))) as their reserve cavalry.The single moast important mistake a young man can make in the 21st Century is failing to realize that he has entered into a relationship with a Neo-Lady-MacBeth.Alzaebo had alluded to men who do not fear women, but the (((Lawfare Industrial Complex))) fears nothing whatsoever; in the immortal words of James Cameron, “It can’t be bargained with, it can’t be reasoned with, it doesn’t feel pity, or remorse, or fear, and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.”PS: Beware of the lure of smoking white hot copulation with the BPD female; you’ll never experience anything else quite like it in your entire life, but it comes at a turrible turrible price.And if you encounter BPD in a Neo-Lady-MacBeth, then God have mercy on your poor condemned soul.

It’s not that hard.What pisses me off is that instead of putting notches in your bedpost bagging these harpies, the PUA focused on exploiting the insecurities, the vulnerabilities, of some of the last remnants of white virtue, those good white girls who were still thinking her knight in white armor was still out there, who hoped against hope that the upper-classmen were wrong, that all men were not swine.And yet you think turning these girls into tatted up, pierced harpies is somehow acting in white interests? And if you destroyed my daughter?I can not envision a sufficiently painful death…

        This is a good list, so maybe the temptation to add to it is too much to bear, but I would suggest this:Do manly things.– Get your hands dirty doing something involving intense (for you) manual labor.  Work your property, build something, fix something, but get “black-under-the-nails”, Lava soap, sweat-grime, “don’t you come in this house like that” dirty.– If you can, pick up an outdoor sport or athletic pursuit that involves at least some element of risk/danger or physical exertion.  Could be a sportsball game, mountain bike, alpine skiing/boarding, trail running, etc.  I’m not saying you have to do stuff that puts your life in danger, but if you come home with a little bit of blood on you, you’re not gonna die and you’ll feel better about yourself.– Take your woman dancing or dining, let her get dolled up, and put yourself in some clothes that say you remember what men ought to look like when you’re out with her.  Stop going to nice restaurants in cargo shorts and flipflops, Skippy.– Fix broken things, clean the garage, and do all the little things that keep your house running mechanically– Do almost anything involving weapons and home defense that doesn’t involve criminal behavior.– Take an hour on a hot day and do **absolutely nothing at all** except sit someplace comfortable outside and drink at least 2 of your favorite beverage.My wife of 25 years doesn’t completely get why I need these things, but she understands that I need them and that the best “father’s day” present she can give me is an entire day lost on some godforsaken mountain trail and I come home covered in mud and maybe I crashed and am bleeding from somewhere nonessential.  She knows I like spending 3 hours on the tractor mowing the field and am covered in dirt because it’s windy and hot outside.I don’t bother her about why she likes to make sourdough bread, and she doesn’t complain when I fire up the kettle grill and make a roadside grilled chicken half and eat the whole thing.

                This evening, /pol/ was saying that the following shiksa comfort girl was ackshually an officer of the Mossad who serviced Lyndon Baines Johnson in the White House [and she may have also serviced JFK before him]:
Mathilde Galland “Krim”https://tinyurl.com/ycy656xw
This was the /pol/ thread:https://tinyurl.com/y7vps2z3
In one of her Wikipedia photographs, she’s staring right past JFK, as though he’s not even there.
JFK looks absolutely clueless.
He’s got deer-in-the-headlights eyes [and he was a world class Chad].

        Now that I’ve listened to all of the podcast, I must say Z that this cast, and last week’s on Orange Man Bad and how he bedevils our betters are two of your best. As Sev might say at his blog, you’ve launched it over the fence these last two weeks.I agreed with many of your points and consider it solid advice for men these days, and for young men coming up. As the old joke says “Common sense, ain’t.” It’s a shame to see what we’ve lost, and what we must regain.Now don’t go all Jordan Peterson on us and wig out. 😏

                Peterson went off the rails a little but he’s not wrong on most things. He had the balls to take on the woke Stazi in Canada, and watching him shred that feminazi man hating bitch on the BBC was a tour de force. Was never a Peterson fanboy, but we need to stop beating down men fighting the good fight because they are human, imperfect and get some things wrong.The manosphere, red pill guys grifters or not have men a lot of useful information on how to interact with women should they choose to, and at a minimum exposing the dangers of interacting with women especially the potentially life destroying dangers of marriage. Many gen X guys on down did not have fathers, true male role models, or anyone to teach them anything about being a classic man, or even being masculine at all.Some of these guys have written to the manosphere “grifters” and thanked them because the info they provided saved them from eating a bullet.At minimum iit has helped some of these guys understand that they are not crazy, and in fact the women, the govt, academia and pussified men have been gas lighting them for generations, and they can at least make sense and readjust their world view to survive this modern madness.

        The profound feminization of the past couple generations is mind-boggling. I’m younger than the original manosphere guys, but even I remember when you could count on a man to be where and when he said he’d be and take constructive criticism soberly.
Millennials and Zoomers will now flake on you with flippancy that puts women to shame. And voicing the slightest critique is apt to evoke a weeping fit.
Dealing with 30-year-old men is now like interacting with 50-year-old women.

Royko said that while he was fiddling with his new toy, the next best seller would be written by a frustrated housewife in Maine who poured out her story onto torn open shopping bags.I believe he has been proven right.“Tech” has swallowed up the obsessions of an entire class of men over many decades now, and helped rob them of those things helped ease them into manhood.Young males from the middle:— Can’t change a car’s oil— Never walked through their neighborhood with a .22 to go shoot cans and bottles— Don’t (can’t) use hand or power tools— Never built a bird house in shop— Would not lace on boxing gloves— Never forced to write on a typewriter, and accept the focus it requires, and deal with the mistakes (and never used a keyboard with the “cent” key— Will never be around male relatives who smoked sweet-smelling pipe tobacco— Don’t dream of emulating male ancestors’ “feats” in WWII— Have no Idea what or when WWII was …and on and on.1953 … well, there was the 1953 Buick Riviera convertible.

Royko said that while he was fiddling with his new toy, the next best seller would be written by a frustrated housewife in Maine who poured out her story onto torn open shopping bags.I believe he has been proven right.“Tech” has swallowed up the obsessions of an entire class of men over many decades now, and helped rob them of those things helped ease them into manhood.Young males from the middle:— Can’t change a car’s oil— Never walked through their neighborhood with a .22 to go shoot cans and bottles— Don’t (can’t) use hand or power tools— Never built a bird house in shop— Would not lace on boxing gloves— Never forced to write on a typewriter, and accept the focus it requires, and deal with the mistakes (and never used a keyboard with the “cent” key— Will never be around male relatives who smoked sweet-smelling pipe tobacco— Don’t dream of emulating male ancestors’ “feats” in WWII— Have no Idea what or when WWII was …and on and on.1953 … well, there was the 1953 Buick Riviera convertible.

            Times change. *shrug* If it were strictly necessary to do things in the classical vein, young men would be doing them. A good example of what’s necessary today is computers.A massive tidal wave of tech knowledge has washed over the First World. There is a reason for that — information technology is vital, and changing your own tire isn’t.You’ve got to prioritize what you know, and by and large the kids are responding to the right cues. It’s better to be a real-life Elon Musk than a mythical Rocky, training primitive in the woods to beat the Russian baddie. If there *were* a real Rocky, he’d be working as a rent-a-cop in some warehouse for minimum wage. Meanwhile the kids who don’t get their hands dirty but have totally mastered tech will be living like gods in San Francisco off their vested stock options. It all depends what you want.— Xloveli (dark.sport.blog)

        Andrew Tate’s popularity, even among some of our guys is a sign of things gone wrong in our world.  He’s a habitul liar.  He brags about being outside of normal society.  He doesn’t claim to be a guy who makes it in our society, but a guy who can live outside of it.  He brags about his criminality.  He brags about being a pimp. Brags about a martial arts record he largely created from whole cloth. He pretty much makes up most of his alleged accomplishments.   Should it even need mentioning that he’s the son of a mudshark?  A man like him normally would find acceptance and admiration from the crowd you’d find in an average prison, not normal men.

            The popularity of Tate and Fuentes is one of the hardest-to-swallow black pills. Because of Progress™, there’s no need to be circumspect about simping for goofy-looking non-white shitlib homosexuals. The entirety of the mainstream media caters to that taste. What then is “the right” for? Just to *lie*? Parade with your own flag, creeps.

            Because as Captain Capitalism “Aaron Cleary” would say… Women love T Rash.All the PUA, Heartiste, Rollo, Roosh game stuff was strictly reactionary due to how post feminazi women were behaving. And guess what, these guys were mostly right.Feminism “radical” feminism and I I’ve been saying this for years, was the worlds biggest shit test. The men of the time failed “boomers.” Gen X and all the others were forced to wade through the rubble and compensate. The PUA “game” stuff was medicine for relief of symptoms of the disease, “feminism.” But not the cure.As the only cure would be for women to stop the madness.Never gonna happen. T Rash for the win.

                Sure, but I never put Cappy or Roosh or Heartiste in the same category as Tate. Cappy has a drop out of the rat race message, with his ‘enjoy the decline’ thing. I don’t know who Rolo is or what he pushes.
But Tate is a completely different animal. He’s just a criminal who is going to end up in prison.

        I remember back when I was into all this manosphere stuff, older people would always just dismiss it as “they just hate women”.  Of course I didn’t listen since all the gurus had forewarned me that those beta boomers would try to talk me out of achieving level 9 cockmaxxed body thetans and scoring an HB 10.Years later I look at all those grifters and they all either never actually achieved a sustainable relationship or if they did end up married you can be sure as shit that when wifey wants the dishes washed its “yes dear” and they don’t employ those alpha male neurolinguistic mind control powers they claim.  The reality is that they were all charlatans for sure, and some of them genuinely did hate women.  I’m convinced that’s the case with Roosh, despite supposedly having all the tools in the box to plow through hundreds of women he still ends up becoming an orthodox monk or whatever.  Like, either you actually hate women and can’t connect with them, or that pickup artist stuff actively prevents a real relationship forming because you spend all your time trying to manipulate the woman like a psychopath.At any rate, all their paypigs have either drifted off or committed suicide and the new crop of retarded men is too nonbinary to talk to girls or achieve erections so the manosphere has achieved the same irrelevance as feminism.  Both ideologies only succeeded in preventing millennials from having any kids, good job on that.

            “that pickup artist stuff actively prevents a real relationship forming because you spend all your time trying to manipulate the woman like a psychopath”I think it’s that, combined with a critical point that none of the PUAs ever grappled with: the ultimate biological purpose of sex. That is, making babies. And then, once the babies are made, being a father in a committed relationship with the mother (I’m assuming for the sake of this thought exercise that the woman is fit to be a mother and not just a, well, slut).I used to read Roosh, and after I became a father, I could really see his total inability to grasp that all the sex he was having was totally meaningless if it ultimately went nowhere, that is, he never created a baby and he never found a woman with whom he’d even want to raise a family. He was getting laid but making zero progress toward fulfilling his core biological imperative, and that was destroying his soul.As you say, he later went monk, or whatever he did exactly, sort of swearing off the PUA life. Trying to save his soul, I guess, but I think all he &amp; his ilk proved is that the casual-sex lifestyle is just as damaging to men as it is to women; I think it’s just that the damage takes longer to accumulate for men.

(There are both Armenian Orthodox and Armenian Catholic churches available.) I saw some of his post player writing. I would characterizing it as “healing, but still on the journey.”

                You had to be there at the time.When the fallout from collapsed marriages showed up and began telling their stories right at the beginning – most of us were shocked at the uniformity of their tales of woe. Most of us thought our tales were unique, that we’d just drawn a crappy hand in life and we’d played it badly. We didn’t even know what a snowflake was, or a social justice warrior or what a 5th wave feminist was. We were astonished that the female perfidy  we saw was unique too. Before long we noticed that the poor behaviour patterns worked like a simple algorithm common to the majority of ‘relationshits’ out there. PUA theory gained credence because in time rancid female behaviour was choreographed and predictable. The guys hurt most by it began to see that if you understood the algorithm, you could game it and even turn it back on the empowered hags and harridans that were running amok. At first they enjoyed great success and it even spawned other claptrap like Vox Day’s geek letter socio-sexual hierarchy.But women are not unthinking machines. They got wise to it and started to refuse to be gamed and both genders discovered that the best way to deal with ‘game’ was to refuse to play. Even the PUA’s discovered that game offered no long term benefits; it just turned men into promiscuous  unhappy sluts too.There are no short cuts to a happy relationship. You have to start with good, stable partners and realize that anything that hurts one of the partners inevitably hurts them both. It was a tough lesson to learn for both sides. Many still have yet to learn it.

            Achieving a stable relationship was never the point of the manosphere. Demonstrating the futility of that was the whole idea. So I wouldn’t call it a failure, more that it was just nihilist from the beginning.

                He didn’t. One axiom of maleness is, when a man tells you how many women he’s banged or how many fights he’s been in, divide that number by six, and then you’re getting warm.

                    The fake body count was part of those day game seminar scams.  The guru would hire women as actresses and he would “approach” them in front of the marks with his card trick or palm reading nonsense and she’d pretend to be seduced by him.

            Aaron Cleary has had a GF as he calls for 15 years, Rollo’s  been married 30 plus years. I highly doubt his wife is a mega bitch. He’s constantly around hot women and could be “balls deep” any time he wants to. Whether these guys moved into “grifting” making money off their material does not mean the material “red pill” / “game” stuff they were preaching doesn’t work or is not accurate.All the nuts and bolts theory Rollo pushes is correct.And if you think about the alpha / beta dichotomy, men of earlier generations by and large simply were more “alpha” or “manly men.” They didn’t need to learn game because game was their natural default setting. Or what Vox used to call alpha 1.0Heartiste placed more emphasis on “asshole game,” and presented it with a dry wit and prose that was simply genius.The tenants of the red pill are factually 100% accurate.Because some of those guys dropped the ball or made perfectly human mistakes like falling in love or developing oneitis, or making large sums of money off it doesn’t make the information snake oil.That’s like saying OJ Simpson wasn’t a great running back because he killed a few ppl.

        Today’s post fired off a lot of neurons in the old brain. Two attributes of being a man especiallly stood out for me. Prudence and Admitting your Mistakes as it concerns two characters from the War Between the States.The first is Abraham Lincoln. Yes, I know he was a railroad lawyer, he trampled on habeas corpus, and I’ve sometimes made a big deal out of being from the South so I’m a little hesitant to write this, but Lincoln IMO exhibited prudence to an exceptional degree. IOW, he manned up. How did he do this? By simply putting his foot down. He must have foreseen what would happen if he didn’t put his foot down, in contrast to his predecessor Buchanan. The Confederacy would have become an independent nation (we can leave aside whether that would have been a good thing or not.) In gaining its sovereignty, it would have received diplomatic recognition from the powerful nations of Europe, and that almost assuredly would have guaranteed its temporary survival. But both the North and the South held in common ownership the western territories. That is to say, there would have been a very messy divorce and they would have been at each other’s throats in no time at all to settle who owned what. So he had to strike when the South was at its weakest. If my great-great grandfather foresaw that it would be long and bloody — and he did — then Lincoln had to know this as well. But Lincoln did it anyway, right or wrong.The second example is Robert E. Lee. I read a book arguing that Lee was a terrible general. It was very persuasive book. His early brilliant victories were owing to his subordinate Stonewall Jackson and when Jackson was killed, it was all but over. After the disaster at Gettysburg, Lee was humble and blamed himself for the defeat. He went on record blaming himself. He knew he had screwed up. But his men loved him anyway and the South forgave him. It speaks to what it takes to be a real man.

                For the record, I didn’t vote on your comment but I kind of see your point.  I have come to despise the actions of Lincoln, yet I grudgingly acknowledge that he never wavered in his goal of complete victory.  Would that we had a leader today similarly committed to unconditional surrender (and a general like Stonewall to serve as the tip of the spear).

                I down voted your comment because it lacked insight and portrayed a schoolboy surface knowledge of the subject.Lincoln’s war destroyed the spirit of 1776 and the original constitution of 1787.  Many of our problems today can be traced back to Lincoln and his Yankee fanatics.  Federal power has gone berserk as illustrated by the fire bombing of civilians at Waco to monitoring school board meetings, to arresting grandma loosely associated with the J-6 crowd.Many of these trespasses of rights and laws stem from  Lincoln’s revolution.Lincoln was a scumy character who fought the war for money on behalf of crony capitalists and protectionists manufacturers.  Before the war, the south was wealthier than the north and Lincoln wanted his hands on some of those riches via high tariffs and protection for northern industrialists who made inferior products to those from Europe.Prudent?  You have to be joking.  He sent thousands of boys in blue to die for some reason in the south land and when some 200,000 fled to Canada to avoid Lincoln, who, in turn, hijacked unsuspecting Irish immigrants and hired German mercenaries. There’s a reason southern soldiers called the union army, “that mercenary hoard”.Lincoln and most of his senior generals would certainly been tried as war criminals had the shoe been on the other foot.As late as early 1865  Grant had failed to take Richmond and was seeking, tentatively, some ceasefire.  Davis refused the terms and old Lincoln had to recruit another 100,000 for his meat grinder.Gettysburg was a defeat because Lee had to withdraw from the field.  But he did so with his army in order, many northern POWs in tow, and herding a large number of beef cattle, taken from the union army.The following quote from a northern general lends credence to southern military leadership., which includes Lee.Major General Don Carlos Buell told Northerners what they should remember should they be tempted to grow boastful about their victory:“It required a naval fleet and 15,000 troops to advance against a weak fort, manned by less than a hundred men, at Fort Henry;  35,000 with naval cooperation  to overcome 12,000 at Fort Donelson; 60,000 to secure victory over 40,000 at Shiloh;  120,000 to enforce the retreat of 65,000 after a month’s fighting and maneuvering at Corinth;  100,000 were repelled by 60,000 in the first campaign against Richmond; 70,000 with a powerful naval force to inspire the campaign which lasted nine months against 40,000 at Vicksburg;  90,000 to barely withstand the assault of 60,000 at Gettysburg;  115,000 sustaining a frightful repulse from 60,000 at Fredericksburg; 100,000 attacked and defeated by 50,000 at Chancellorsville; 85,000 held in check for two days by 40,000 at Antietam; 70,000 defeated at Chattanooga, and beleaguered  by 40,000 at Chattanooga to Atlanta . . . and finally 120,000 to overcome 60,000 with exhaustion after a struggle of a year in Virginia.”A leader can be judged in part by those he selects as sub-commanders.It’s Hitler’s birthday tomorrow.

                    Brilliant and factual rebuttal, Pecosbill.  You beat me to it.  Lincoln is by far the worst POTUS ever – more American blood on his hands than all other 45 POTUS combined.  The fact that  the GOP loves to call itself “the party of Lincoln” tells us everything you need to know about what’s gone wrong in this once great, free country.

I intend to stick to my guns. At least on the Lincoln question. I may have been too harsh on Lee however. The author of that book I mentioned may not have said that Lee was a “terrible” general, just that he was over his head. Personally, I always wonder what would have happened if Davis had elevated Forrest, but that would have been too unconventional I guess.

                Also, nobody’s questioning the caliber of the Southron rank-and-file soldier compared to the Union soldier. This was Lee’s greatest failure, how many lives he squandered for his victories. It kind of reminds one of Ukraine vs. Russia today.

Strauss and Mystery and Roissy and Roosh will always be giants in my book.3)  Open Borders for Asian Women ONLY.   AFAIK, they are the only ones who aren’t interested in silly dating games and directly hook-up with all the nice white guys who treat them good.

            If not for the flood of Indians, the children of white nerds and nice Asian girls would be the worst people in North America. They’re *by far* the most extreme of the “woke”/anti-white because they’re the most conformist.

            Once you bring the Asian bride over here, and she’s exposed to Paris Hilton, Kardashian trash, slut, feminazi culture, all bets are off. Coupe kids, McMansion, Range Rover and Beemer in the garage, divorce, cash and prizes, back on the cock carousel. Asian bride game is a cope.

        The Manosphere is even bigger than before. It has different people and a different platform and different focus, but its huge. Both Critical Drinker and Nerdrotic get interviewed by Piers Morgan. Other outlets include: Overlord DVD (his comic schtick is he’s a comic book VILLAIN who finds Hollywood too evil for him), Midnight’s Edge (run by a former Norwegian hedge fund guy who HATES commies), Culture Casino, a former toy executive (WDW Pro), and Valiant Renegade (sort of a investment analyst / Rush Limbaugh combo). Drinker regularly pulls in more views in a week than stuff on various broadcast networks.Its a different phase. It is comprised of dudes who have seen their childhood heroes, their favorite video games, their favorite comic book heroes, sci-fi franchises and fantasy franchise ruined by “put a chick in it and make her lame and gay.” They have largely given up on women as bars have collapsed along with music scenes and dating is swipe left/right with only the top guys being successful. Charisma does not count when filtered out by an income, height, physique, and other metrics profile.If you believe the stats, most younger White guys are single, don’t have sex, or a girlfriend, and won’t ever have one. Their female peers are mostly fat/lesbian, or Alpha BPD Widows flitting from one Alpha to the next. Most of their female peers seem to openly loathe their male peers. A woman like Katherine Maher, whose entire life seems to be oriented around  destroying anything that White males like, or some 300lb Cancel Pig is their option.And this has the Regime world-wide very, very worried. Its why Andrew Tate who would otherwise be a minor annoyance had a ton of bricks come down on him. Why Roissy was doxxed, and the rest silenced. Any dude who can gather a group of White men particularly young White men is a manifest threat to the fake, gay, and lesbian world of the Regime. The Regime has literally nothing to offer young / youngish White men. Stanford admitted only 20% Whites, and of that 20% only 9% where men, meaning only 2% of their most recent admit class is White Men (and 100% of that is ((())) ). Similar results are there for Harvard, Yale, etc. The Military has new goals with Gen Brown now Chief of Staff, demanding a ceiling of 40% White men for officers and non-coms. Meaning demotions for White men are coming, and big ones at that. Bloomberg estimates that since the Summer of George Floyd, only 6% of new hires by Fortune 500 were White (and likely all of those women particularly lesbians). There are no economic opportunities for the overwhelming majority of young / youngish White men nor romantic ones nor even escapism any more.As above, all White male heroes have been replaced by lesbians of color. In every comic book, fantasy, sci-fi, adventure, and action franchise. With a promise for young White men that “in the future you will own nothing, have no privacy, live in the pod, eat the bugz, and use the pronouns.” Plus, your childhood hero got shown up to be a loser (just like you) and replaced by some lesbian of color.The Regime knows that SOMEONE will pick up the crown, lying in the gutter, with the point of his sword. They are determined that it will not happen on Social Media and there they will be successful. I think someone will pick up that crown however and it will happen not online but within physical networks somewhere unexpected. No one, and I mean NO ONE in the Regime inspires respect and admiration by Straight White men (twinks don’t count).

                fakeemail —‘Whiskey is also a giant of the OG Manosphere in my book!’Concur.  Whiskey’s been at it a long time, on many pages and platforms, and he does not give up.  His survey of the global powers vs manosphere war is spot-on.Anybody who has been involved with the manosphere for a long time knows it is booming.  What Whiskey mentioned just scratches the surface.  E.g., Terrence Popp and his engineer Toxic Male produce an outstanding channel, full of help and encouragement for men.  Serving and bettering their brothers, not tearing them down.Undead Chronic, MGTOW Monk, Ribby Frog, Better Bachelor, TFM . . . I could go on and on.  The powers on a global, yes global, scale are plenty worried, and they are worried about the manosphere, because that’s the only place left in the West where strong men exchange the truth, and thereby elevate themselves and armor themselves against an enemy that hates them.

Its heavily celibate with with some “relationship guys”   As Whiskey noted it starting to scare the establishment since  it means many less babies, lesschild support, alimony, much less economic activity and much less involvement in grnding for anyone’s purpose but their own

            Whiskey —Even with every national — and sometimes global — power and institution operating in force against it, the manosphere still prevailed.  With the grifters now largely gone, it is booming in content, and the enemies of free men know it well.  I dunno what Z is talking about.When the feds trotted out their Disinformation Office hag, and her only stated intent was to destroy the manosphere, that tells it all right there.  D.C. doesn’t fear ‘white supremacists’ and it damn sure doesn’t fear Conservatism Inc.  That’s just for the rubes and rubettes.  They fear US.You can’t stop the signal if it’s the truth.  It wears at their hearts and grinds them down.  It is a beautiful corrosion to witnes and makes me want to sing.

        I’m old enough to remember when pickup football was played spontaneously on dirt lots and tree lawns, and doing it in the rain was a Godsend because it was more fun than sport. That is how traditional male ethos was sustained in my youth. My sons played organized rugby and it served the same purpose; taught the manly arts via teamwork and competition; combining brute physical and nimble mental labor.Half the US population is male and we tolerate living in a country in which the nominal figurehead of our government shits his pants and can’t speak a coherent sentence. We have “evolved” from George Washington to Dementia Joe. That is no way to live and we do our manly ancestors great shame by allowing this abomination to persist. Despite the doomsday propaganda that creates a false impression of systemic weakness, there are still to this day, millions of real men living here and stoically seething at our descent into feminized cuckoldry. The spring is wound tight.There will be a reckoning and it will not come via voting harder.

            Seething is the word. This post hit hard today. I am currently involved, just for a few days, with a project involving several other people. The person leading it, who is putting in way more time than I, is a younger, fat woman (an “Ally” type). I despise her for several reasons, and I know she does not care for me.Nothing would give me greater pleasure than voicing a few choice words to her, for she is often brusque and rude. I know, however, beyond my occasional quip, I can go no further. For those who say otherwise, I have a career about which I must concern myself. But, I assure you, I seethe.

                    Beluga Land Whales have needs, just like anorexic (((Victoria’s Secret))) supermodels have needs.
Your job is to give them what they need.
And who knows, that Beluga Land Whale might be able to cook some tasty dinner for ya.
Furthermore, I guaran-d@mn-tee she’ll appreciate that cl!t-massage [she’ll still be reminiscing about it on her deathbed].

                    I was not clear. I have a great job and like it a lot. This is a side obligation, once a year or so, for about three extra hours for three days. My job is not the day in day out demoralizing corporate world. And, just this time, I got paired with fatty. I will talk to my bosses, and the pairing will never happen again. I won’t badmouth, just politely request for personal reasons. Just these few days are grinding my gears.

                I’ve found that finding things to do outside of work that cancel people like that out works best for me.  I like to get the men around me talking about the things they like to do and we all try to one-up each other.  It’s good fun and drives the Karen’s up the wall.Actual conversation from the weekly exec meeting:“What’d you guys do over the weekend?”“Ran the Moab Trail Half Marathon. Almost fell off a cliff.  Lost four toenails.  You?”“Me and my buddies went elk hunting.  I got some burgers coming, you want some?”“Did a hut hike on the Colorado trail.  Like 50 miles or something.”“Nothin’.  I coach my son’s hockey team.  Stuck there all weekend.”One of the ladies I work with is pretty cool, she interjected with, “You guys are lucky.  I hung drywall and did the mud so I can paint next weekend.”Come to think of it, I work with a lot of cool people.  Sorry bro.

                    So, yesterday, apparently my comments to her were spread amongst them men, who quietly discussed their irritation with her; people not there mentioned it. I laughed. I am very careful, nothing being offensive, but pushback.So, I was working with a few other guys on a task later yesterday and she bumbles over and starts asking for something of me while another guy was talking. I looked at her, turned back to him, and said, “I am sorry, can you please continue from where you were when we were interruptrd?” Dead silence. Fatty left without a word. Not 5 minutes later, she came back, waited, and then asked me, using please and thank you, to do something. When she left, I looked at the guys around me and said, “You have to remember you have something that hangs between your legs.” No hyperbole, she was polite the rest of the evening. Sometimes you just have to remind them…And, to comment below, I have great bosses, and they adore me. I actually outrank the lady, but on this project she takes the lion’s share of work, so she is the coordinator. And, I get it, she has a lot on her plate. But, at the same time…So, have a great weekend. I certainly have a smirk on my face today.

            My uncle down the street bought the vacant lot next to his house and me, my cousins, and the rest of the neighborhood kids had a perfect field for playing “Kill the Guy” (known as “Smear the Queer” in some parts of the U.S.).  In the early days of ESPN they often showed Aussie rules football so we also contrived a version of that to play because it too was a glorious free-for-all of violence and mud.

                In winter, it was snowball fights. Variation on this theme was a version of war. Divide up into teams, one at each end of the lot. First build a snow fort and stockpile snowballs for the battle. Next was to cut the ends off of large appliance boxes and flex them into a mock tread loop that 2 guys could get inside and crawl forward (our version of a tank). Then the battle would commence and continue until we were too tired to move.
Great memories, great friendship, great fun, and great experience growing up into men.

        Gen X, I was made to play contact sports early in elementary school onwards. I boxed and wrestled with better than average records, say 22-7 with some key spikes at state quarter finals.  Even on my own volition I played on the #2 ranked rugby team in N. America as starting hooker. Later, and occasionally still, I skydive although I have zero desire to again leap from a local FM radio mast. But it taught me Rule #9 from my good friend Roger Nelson, with whom I once was “family,” NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, NEVER EVER GIVE UP. This annoying fully capitalized truism is a commandment every man must adhere to even under terminal medical death sentence or comparable. You may quit at events, but we must never ever quit on what is important. Never. I say this having experienced actual real life near death experiences in the raw. 0.02

            Being a “woman of a certain age” I have to say I LOVE MANLY MEN, the kind with calluses on their hands not just from their golf clubs, the kind who might actually have been punched in the face at least once, or have gotten and given a punch or two, the kind whose mothers taught them to hold open doors for women, to protect the women and kids, to be kind to old folks, and to lay down the law when necessary ( it’s a sad fact that we girls will push the envelope right up to the line, just to see how far you will let us go), and the kind who make me get a hot shiver watching them fix things around the house. Guys, don’t give up, there are women out there that desperately want husbands, just “fish where the fish are”.

                A Symbolic Gesture —
Your words would carry more weight were America not a gynocracy that has made it clear for decades that it hates and wishes to exterminate fatherhood, sonship, masculinity, and freedom (for men).
Your ‘keep looking for those great women, they’re out there!’ suggestion wore better fifty years ago.  Before women/feminism gleefully took over everything except the manosphere.
Now, your suggestion feels more like additional Lucy Football in Charlie Brown’s front yard.

                Until they don’t. This is the problem. No fault divorce destroyed marriage. Without the state or a religion backing up your marriage, you may not really be married. What passes for the Catholic Church will annul any marriage you present to it for annulment.and of course you can always get divorced .

I’m old enough to be familiar with loss, but losing him has been the hardest to bear by far.The few young women I know with similar perspectives have something in common – they survived a brutally abusive relationship (battered women, not the peacocking me-too crowd).  Hardship and sorrow crafted my appreciation for a real man.  If that’s the recipe, then maybe a real man looks for a young woman who has survived true suffering but doesn’t identify as a victim.  That’s probably a rare thing.

                “… and the kind who make me get a hot shiver watching them fix things around the house. Guys, don’t give up, there are women out there that desperately want husbands.”
Yeah, and then when you get sick of him you can take half his shit in divorce court while you’re fucking someone else. Or falsely accuse him of “domestic violence” and have the cops beat the fuck out of him and take his guns.
Give me your number, babe, I can hardly wait…

            I’m Gen X, too.  We definitely grew up as the “rub some dirt on it” generation.  I remember playing ghost-man baseball from noon until it got too dark to see the baseball coming at your face.  Any kind of football was fun, but especially if it was muddy.  In October, my brother and I would put on a couple layers of sweatshirts (padding) and play 1:1 football.  You hike the ball to yourself and try to run over the other brother.  If you made it across the yard in 4 plays, that was a touchdown.Baseball games as a kid involved getting in the back of the coaches’ pickup trucks with your gear and 10 other kids, and driving 15 miles on backroads to some other town to play against their neighborhood team.I took some real beatings and it sucked sometimes because I wasn’t the biggest kid.  But now I look back on it and am glad for it.

        A lot of people don’t realize the true social revolution that the Manosphere actually was. I think you would have to had grown up in a truly pozzed shitlib hive as I was to properly appreciate it.In a liberal hive there is no morality, no code, no real rules. Ughhh… the women are nutcases. Their men are cucks and wretches that just want peace and quiet at any cost. I do not cast stones at the Grillers… there but for the grace of God go I. It was a nightmare as a kid and truly hell as an adult. I spent most of my adult years in that hive with my nose in a glass trying to ignore the lunacy and BS around me.When I discovered the Manosphere it was mind blowing. Men like me were finally able to gather and compare notes. The sheer volume of data provided the basis for immediate, entirely plausible explanations and theories on female and shitlib behaviour. Patterns jumped out almost at once. All of a sudden we all had a good understanding of why these people acted the way they did and how to insulate ourselves against them. Men that were put through inhuman divorce courts had a place to speak and be heard. Do you remember how ithat was? It used to be that in divorce, it was always the man’s fault. The woman was always the victim. The men went to the cleaners, and the women went to the bank. If it can be said that men are pigs…then it follows that our women are sows. They would never allow a space like the Manosphere to exist in the mainstream. It was also a place to heal for some. Many commented that it was toxic and it was in places…but chemo is toxic too.I don’t care what anyone says, Heartiste was a gift from God. His wit and sense of humour were maybe not as refined as that of our esteemed blog host…but his mockery and satire left scars and marks on the dregs of our society that can still be seen today! I think he chit poasts on Blab under the handle of “Nillas With Attitude “? The guy sure sounds like him.I agree with the fella down below. The Manosphere didn’t go away; it went mainstream and became a pillar of modern Dissident thought. Nobody gets married anymore. Everyone knows that most of our women are insane. Men that are not tied up in families, men that were wronged and wrongfully cast out – are not festering and seething like they used to. They are working out, acquiring new skills and improving themselves – and that’s a good thing that we should support and encourage.I predict the same for dissidence. It is starting to go mainstream now and soon it too will become an accepted and acknowledged pillar of our world view that nobody will really think of much after they accept it as fact.I only had time for half the show and it promises to be another good one! 😎👍Have a great weekend you guys.

                I still watch Popp occasionally too… he’s right about that MGTOW stuff too. It isn’t the answer for everyone… but if you go hard into the boards with a nasty relationship that beats the stuffing out of you… why not? Jump on the motorcycle, go sailing or camping and just take some time to get your head on straight.I dunno if I could adopt it as a way of life… but as a temporary healing measure…. anything that gives you a reason to keep going is good enough for me…

            Before everything, many good points made in this podcast episode.My 2c, the red pill on reddit (and MGTOW) were nuked so they were onto something. One sign they were needed was that I actually learnt about this stuff from a married Trad Catholic friend of mine. These guys are very scrupulous so he had to be in a really bad situation to come to a community that can be so crass about women. There is also married red pill, and dead bedrooms, you can guess the meaning of the last forum. Basically men that are “too perfect” like the famous Kaka that got divorced last week, reporting how they don’t get the marital duty anymore.As some have mentioned Heartiste is still around and occasionally posts about sexual dynamics. Rollo Tomassi has a 4 hour Sunday sermon, a second channel, and appears in other channels frequently. YouTube still has Aaron Clarey, Entrepreneurs in Cars, Sandman, and others that continued the movement after it was nuked from Reddit. There have been many grifters coming and I have seen healthy pushback from the present -more distributed- manosphere. There was a fake convert from prostitution “Nala” that got a lot of congratulations from other “trad women” and mentally weak men (Michael Knowles) and I saw a healthy pushback on the subject. This month there was a synchronized tantrum from some female “trads” about how mean (mysogynist, excuse me I am a misanthrope) are some elements on the right, this signals we are still making an effect.There is for sure some movement fatigue and sometimes you feel the despair in young men that are around movements like MGTOW. I was into another crazy environmentalist fedposter around 15 years ago (Derrick Jensen, he posted about blowing up stuff for the salmon) and he had an anecdote about a fellow activist that got sick of it and joined Wall Street as an analyst, Derrick was sympathetic with the “traitor” as sometimes these movements get too negative, so the retirees of a movement are part of the business as usual.If you check a couple of the guys on YouTube, the algorithm will feed you others of varying quality, but some are good. The new era of the manosphere will be like a whack-a-mole game as the matrix will attack it using new tactics. Andrew Tate is an example of a possible saboteur sent by the matrix to discredit the movement, as usual the devil mixes some truth with lies and he may have helped some, but in general I cannot wait for him to disappear. But Tate is useful to the Matrix so I think he will stay. The people making real change will be crushed, unless they have figure out ways around cancellation or they are prudent.But MGTOW and gender dynamics red pill are still needed and they will stay. One constructive criticism to the host is that he pointed out a silly scandal of one of the visible heads of said movement, but this is NYT level stuff. These movements get weirdos all the time that may be even sometimes saboteurs, but in general there are a lot of good people still around.One old post that was part of the red pill onboarding was the Male shaming tactics that feminists employ. This helps you understand why everything they want eliminated is “creepy”, this is meant to bring embarrassment. But we are cured of shame so maybe this word should be retired in our side. Every time I hear this term I think of a red hair feminist.

        My first take on listening the the first 1/3rd of the podcast is as follows — and I could not take any more, sorry host. You KNOW who Roosh is in this space, why say otherwise?It sounds to me like the views of someone that has not successfully raised any sons. I am pretty sure the blog host is around my age, and I have no hard data to know whether that is the case, and for all I know he is the ultimate mentor, father, keeps that to self.For me and mine, two sons now young adults and thriving — also un-jabbed, former readers of Chateau (anyone can find it easily, it is not ‘gone’ in that sense, just not active anymore) — both married, with full understanding of the nature of women, partly gleaned from Heartiste, Roosh V., and others.They golf. Ski. Ride dirt bikes. Work on their own damn cars. Fix their own damn houses. Sorry, they are not ‘country’ or ‘dirt’ people. We share reading lists and they do with their friends. They are not geeks, incels, but not ‘chads’ … perhaps some males forgot the attraction ‘average’ looking men have to the opposite sex by simply being capable??Successfully raising sons is not rocket science. It is a MENTORED activity, that takes a plan and involvement. Focus, giving up new car smell, your wife’s desires for a ‘bigger house’ and so on. When you have to assert your will for them, you do. Mommy-raised boys are by definition weaklings, or later bullies, but behind ‘laws’ or ‘rules’ or from a cubicle or government job.It starts by BEING a man. And that can be self-taught if your father was less than fully formed as a man.I don’t think this blog’s readers need me, just one man, to give an instructional guide on how to mentor boys into men. Unless we have entered a new ‘dark age’ where this basic, fundamental knowledge HAS been lost.Have we? Are the readers here so weak, effeminate, that they can’t get their SELVES out to mow their own lawns among one of the simpler tasks?This ‘attitude’ of being a ‘man’ — means squat if you have no skills. It means your woman and children have to always look to ANOTHER MAN to do even the most basic tasks. Pretty much, that’s what I see in my suburban zone: weak, beta males that can’t swing a hammer without striking their own crotch, letting their wives — whether they’ve been divorced already or not — raise their ‘sons’ while posting on the internet as if ‘all is lost’, no more ‘masculinity…’

            These men where never taught to swing a hammer or fix a car.  They spent their formative years in school and probably wasted their time learning nothing being taught by mediocrities at best.
Boys have all this raw material and enthusiasm and they wilt sottomg in classrooms.  All that time, and the damn schools don’t teach one practical thing the whole time.

                My wife once asked, “How do you know how to do all these things?  I think I was doing some electrical wiring in the house.  I’d never been asked such a question, so was taken back by this back-handed compliment of sorts.  I was at a loss for reply, so I abruptly said, “failure”.I don’t think she understood and I didn’t quite understand the reply myself until I thought about it, but it was an accurate answer in the main.  My whole life has been spent in doing things from a basic understanding of first principles, and a foolish arrogance wrt my abilities.  Some of my first attempts were spectacular failures—but *never* my second attempts.That’s the nature of real men IMHO.

                    “My wife once asked, “How do you know how to do all these things?”No, my experience is MUCH worse since it is my fellow ‘men’ that marvel at basic skills. Sad. They want to know ‘where you learned’ and if I say, ‘worked construction as a kid’ they nod, knowingly, since that lets them off the hook since by dint of fate they did not.If I say, ‘hey retard’ there’s thing thing called youtube…’Or, ‘we swapped drive trains with a greasy, hard covered Motor manual as our only source as 17 year olds.Since I move through an affluent swamp due to local and business dealings, direct interactions are educational.Bankers, tech guys, high VPs in well known companies, some school teachers and admin types, a hedge fund president … the ‘cream’ of our culture’s crop. One commonality: they raise, er, their wives raise the WIMPIEST SONS on earth and they have a strange fascination with the appearance of their daughters, for the ones that are not grossly self-disfigured.These guys consider me their ‘friend’ as that seems to be as deep as ‘friendship’ goes without them realizing I do not plan on spending my remaining days above ground hearing them talk about their two favorite subjects: their health and their money.They revel in having a gay kid. A lot of them do, like Irish Catholic families might have a priest, or sister in the fold — the new donation to the state religion is the one gay kid.

            Checking in — I figured I would get a batch of downvotes, aka proof of concept. Good to see more pushback from regulars here, supporting guys like Rollo, etc. IMO the host shits on them, and I may be over the target about why, based on the downvotes.One of my 20-something sons gives copies of The Rationale Male to his friends that need it. Don’t want to self dox with the details so just understand that these guys ended up learning about female nature the hard way, but up to the point were cheerleaders for the ‘blue pill’ life.And life taught them a lesson, good and hard.My own reading/listening to Roosh came when he was against the culture, the lockdowns, and his cross-country tour videos were great. Funny, discussion fodder.I get it that the ‘red pill’ can be the reverse side of the coin with feminism, since both seem to aim at reducing or eliminating marriage and family formation. However, the red pill also has lessons that allow men to push back, through knowledge, and HAVE successful marriages and families.Plus, although I came here via CH, true – calling the PUA thing “pooh-ah” sound pretty fucking gay.

        Teenage missionaries from local churches ring my doorbell every so often. They give me pamphlets, so it’s only fair that give them something in return. I keep a box of books ready next to the door:
For young men, I give them Masculinity Amidst Madness by Ryan Landry and Thriving in Bad Places by James LaFondFor young women, I give them Communities that Abide by Dmitri Orlov
I wanted to give more edgy titles but if it’s too edgy and some higher up finds out, they will just avoid my address on the next pass.

                Gates of Fire I’m told is required/recommended reading at the military academies.  However, historical stickler that I am, it’s a terrible read wrt historical accuracy—of which little is known.  Perhaps a good basis for a movie script in the likeness of “300”, but terrible wrt to what we know of the Battle of Thermopylae and the last stand of Leonidas and his body guards.

        Excellent post and I plan to listen to the podcast later . . . with my husband.  Illustrative anecdote:  I was describing a meme to him (in a brief break from his work this morning) that I saw at Big Country’s blog.  ‘Sounds That Guys Love to Hear.’  So I mentioned the weapon firing, the beer can being popped open, the meat sizzling . . . and my husband – without having seen this meme – automatically knew and said what the last ‘sound’ was with me – and laughed.  And said “See, you married a ‘real man.”

            Too funny. I figured that’s where it was headed, but went over to BCE to make sure, and about that time, Mrs. Steve walked into my office. So I started reading the meme to her, and by the time I got to the meat sizzling panel, she had stepped between my office chair and my desk, and said she had about an hour to make another sound real men love to hear.
Apropos of nothing, it’s good to be the owner of the company where the Do Not Disturb notifications mean exactly that.

Consider the sudden disappearance of the manosphere in that context.
I believe that the “success” of a blog such as this one is dependent on its visibility remaining below a certain threshold, that if it became too popular, it also would be dealt with.

        The media brought the PUA stuff out in the open, intentionally, and counted on that killing it. Mystery even took the bait and did a cheesy dating show on VH1. Of course this lines up perfectly with the Mystery that Strauss wrote about, as he always longed for attention and fame. He was easy pickings. Bringing PUA to the attention of every female and soyboy on Jezebel and Reddit was enough. Of course, this is because it worked. The idea that men could once again take charge of their own life in all aspects, including their relationships with women, is not acceptable and not to be tolerated. This whole liberal operation does not work unless men are defanged and women are in charge.Didn’t Heartiste get doxxed? I vaguely remember that, then his website disappeared. This was, if I recall, not long after he started talking about juice more explicitly.

            If I recall, Heartiste transitioned (heh) from dating advice to politics sometime around 2015. This may have coincided with his attaining middle age or his interest in Trump.
Anyhow, he was deplatformed on WordPress during his political phase when he began ‘noticing’ things.

        My son is 23 and went through much of what Z describes.  Made real friends playing sports.  Moved on to stuff like kick-boxing and jujitsu to test his limits,  Did manual work for the pay, but also for the experience.
Like a lot of kids in his generation, he seemed to instinctively know when teachers were spewing nonsense and reject it.  Probably helped having parents who agreed with him.

            All along he and his types were pointing out the problems with modern women and society in general.  Many of them seemed to have matured out of the pick-up game thing to wanting a more traditional life for men and women.

        The man-o-sphere served its purpose of drawing in young men, men who wouldn’t have given a shit about politics otherwise, over to the alt-right to be polarized and used. It was a content mill (FFS, that’s exactly what Return of Kings was) and sales funnel for the political engagement.Then the alt-right served its purpose from 2016 to 2020, when we then get the shift over to the “dissident right,” for more politically-aware but politically jaded audience members (democracy bad! don’t mention I voted for Reagan!) or Musk-approved transhuman-4chan-lite, for the normies (we’re winning for real this time! he’s our guy!).Carefully look at how neither offers any meaningful solutions but focuses on seeding the idea of the “coming” collapse/decline, when the US loses power… this seed of the “decline” oddly seems to sound like, under the surface, Yarvin-Thiel style global technocracy. At least that sounds like the unstated end-goal.Curiously Beale is back at pumping up a new blog and soon a new book on the Social Sexual Hierarchy. Can anyone guess what that’s about?

        Collapse of ‘manosphere’?  There’s no collapse.If you mean the PUA and related grifters aged-out of their profitable stupidity, ok that’s valid.  But the ‘manosphere’ already is PART of American culture, part of the collective Dreaming Mind of the west.  It hasn’t collapsed.  It just won, expanded from text to vids, and the grift-ticks moved on.Things that start very small take time to percolate on down.  And the manosphere started long before Roissy and Mystery and Ted Beale.Assuming that the sad assortment of grifters milking the manosphere the past 15 years represents what’s happening — what’s already happened — to anglo-nation men is inaccurate.  These leeches came on-board a ship that already was well underway, a ship that neither wanted nor needed their calculating presence.  Men don’t need Game.  They need to crush feminism and the rest of their enemies.As for men turning 50 and suddenly morphing into skeevy weirdos, that’s just the game-boys.  I am over 70, in crumbling health, and I have no problem attracting young women where I live.  No game, no effort, no relationship counselors, just being myself.  Sux to be Mystery I guess.

But…I’m old, ugly, and ornery and I have seen it too. You’d be astonished at what loneliness and living with cats does to women. They get so lonely and desperate especially as they age. They starve for company… ANY company. They will go dippy around any unattached man they come across.

                Hun —Spoken like a third-rate man who — unable to attract women — determines instead to call others who can liars.I live in a remote and wild part of a ‘third world’ country.  Have for many years.  Obviously, all you have is to dump on others who spark your resentment and inferiority.I will be glad to ask a local friend — a respected fireman with a family who has known me for years — to post here and validate everything I say.  And thus to expose you for what you are.Living in snarky resentment is not manly.  Make yourself better instead of tearing others down by accusing them falsely, like a vengeful woman.

Ok.  Thank you for taking time to help me understand.
This kind of kidding is fine between old friends on the golf course.  Strangers on the internet, not so much.
I do not accept being called a liar as being in good fun.  All we have on the internet is our word.  I take truth and manly honor seriously and I demand it in all my friends.  Ask them.
Nor do I seek acceptance in this, or any, group.  I have a church and these are the men who know me best.

Ray, if you’ve been reading and posting here for awhile—and you have—I don’t consider you a stranger.  You should not consider us strangers either.
This particular comment community is the best you’re gonna get on the internet (IMHO) and if you bear with us for a while longer, you’ll see pretty much the same personal revelations,  stories, and advice that I bet are on par with your “in person” friends.
Bear with us.   😉

And the protestations of these dill does that I can’t take a joke is bs, and you know that too.As much as I despise the woke, at least I feel some pity for them because many have been brainwashed from childhood.But with my enemies here, I have no such pity because their accusations and one-way ‘jokes’ are an attack, and they know it, and like a hen pack, deny any such attack ever took place.

            I concur that there’s really no collapse. I recall finding the manosphere/PUA world right around 2016 myself. I won’t say that it was a breath of fresh air so much as confirmation of what I already knew but lied to myself about.Case in point: I had observed in my dating life that most of the really feminist women were also huge gold-diggers who wanted Mr. Perfect, 6’2 or better, seven figure income, astronaut, Nobel Prize winner, etc… In short, they acted like they wanted to be a trad-wife to some alpha male while maintaining that they “don’t need no man!”.It made sense when you consider that “feminism” is really just a form of hive mind status signalling. It makes sense that it correlates with the desire for a comfortable life without much effort. The feminist rhetoric is just a thin coat of paint over women’s ancient motivations. To use the PUA framework – it doesn’t matter what women *say*, it’s what they *do* that shows you what their game really is.Once you see these things, you don’t unsee them. You also don’t need to hear the same things again from a different person. Sites like this thrive because they have a quotidian aspect. Z has written some “manifesto” type stuff but most of this blog is about analyzing the daily events from a dissident perspective. As long as the neocons keep trying to blow up the world and Biden keeps saying stupid stuff and tripping over his own feet Z and all of us have something new to talk about.

            Given the state of young ladies today, you can’t really blame the pickup artists for throwing in the towel.Two examples from my life:1) This happened at a Christmas time party within the last three years. The party is hopping and one of my extended family’s sons comes up to me and asks me to show him how to make a Martini for someone who asked him for one. So I get the mixin’s and we start talking as I teach him. This young man had graduated college and was going on to medical school to be an eye doctor/surgeon. Good young man, smart, thin, tall, easy-going, all around what dudes of my era would call “A good guy / a decent guy”. So I ask him about school, what he’s learning, future plans, etc. Y’Know, what the older folks asked me at parties when I was his age. (“I have one word for you Benjamin: Plastics.” 😂)So then we get to talking about what one figures men talk about: women. I ask him if he’s dating anyone. Nope. So, sotto voce, I ask him “So, are any of your female classmates not overweight, tattooed, multi-pierced, sporting weird colored hair, and spouting Radically Left political views?” He was taken aback by my bluntness, then looked kind of downcast and answered honestly “No”.He’s graduated Med School and is practicing now. Still single. Dummy me being a dude I would think he’s a “Great Catch” for a young woman, but I’m a dumb old dude and women today are weirder than they were when I were a lad.2) Going to my local brewery. The staff is barmen/barmaids. One thing I notice is the gals (usually in their twenties) all dress “frumpy”. Big shapeless sweatshirts or t-shirts, torn, baggy jeans, their hair isn’t really “done up” (Think perms, curls, waves, that stuff). And they all have:– Nose piercings (the septum piercing) or multiple ear piercings.– Tattoos. Some “sleeve” style on their arms, some on their legs shown the odd times they wear shorts, or peeking through their torn jeans.– Some, when they do “spruce up” their hair color it’s shades The Dear Lord did not intend human hair to be. (C’mon girls, streaks of neon green or neon raspberry?)True story: One year the brewery near me had a Halloween party and one of the barmaids dressed as a cheerleader. Not a “Naughty Cheerleader”, but a “throwback” look: Long sleeved “Cheer Sweater”, school color skirt, long hair with a bow in it, that sort of thing.Take the damned ring out of her nose and I’d have never recognized her. She was, GASP!feminine. Under her frumpy clothing was a cute gal with a nice figure. She had hips! A cute butt! A bosom! She looked like, get this, a woman. Were I twenty fiv, well, let’s say younger, I’d make a damned fool out of myself trying to get a date.And then the next day, back to the frump. 🤦‍♂️We all used to joke “A woman lets a man chase her until she decides to catch him.” Now these gals act like they don’t even want to be chased, or catch anyone. They’re certainly not embracing being feminine. And I get it, not every woman is a “girly girl”, all jewelry and dresses and purses. But really, do women these days not “Enjoy Being a Girl” as the old song goes? Apparently not from what I’ve seen. It’s a stunner to see a young woman in a dress when out and about.Our weakness as men is we’ll put up with a lot if she has a pretty face, a nice figure, or a feminine way about her. With this crop seems we’re over that.

                I’m blessed that my sons are dating feminine women who dress relatively modestly. One thing I’ve noticed about my teenage sons is their generation aren’t “serial monogamists” as my best friends and I were. My oldest son in college has dated his girlfriend since freshman year, while my next oldest son has been with his since his junior year.I think one of the issues with relationships is that sex is now transactional and the mystery has been bled out of it. I remember when I met my wife in college. She was a Croatian tennis player, blonde, perfect cheek bones, long legs (she’s 5-11) and a face that could launch a thousand ships. Her serve sounded like a 16-inch cannon blast and her laugh was (and still is) musical.When I first saw her, I was so hit by the thunderbolt that I ran into a tree and that was her first gaze upon me. As a basketball and baseball player, I had no problem getting girls, but this time was different.She told me she would save sex for marriage and that I’d have to go to Croatia, meet her family, have them sign off on our courtship and I’d have to ask her father for her hand in marriage. I was so in love I did all of those things and more than a quarter-century later, I’ve not wanted for anyone else.I’m sad that young men won’t get that kind of experience. We’ve weathered a lot of storms and you need that closeness, that partnership to get you through the rough times. My wife was once apolitical, but I realized she’d been listening to me too much when I heard her tell my oldest son that she was glad he wasn’t dating a “blue-haired wannabe lesbian communist.”

                “Our weakness as men is we’ll put up with a lot if she has a pretty face, a nice figure, or a feminine way about her. With this crop seems we’re over that.”Around here you hear, The collapse is the cure, and there’s some strong evidence. A reset of male/female relations. Indifference, a chance not to cuck.I’m of the mind that game was a last-ditch effort to get something out of women. In my experience, at least in my dating pool of educated women, family and domestic happiness were mostly off the table even 20-25 years ago. Starting a family with a 30-something girl boss, hooray. Which left the sorry consolation of empty sex.Otoh, my attitude sucked, too. I was after bigger things than family, so birds of a feather, I guess. Didn’t start seeing the trap until late 20s, when we all started thinking about settling down without really knowing how to do it. It was a mess!Sounds like the young guys have even less to look forward to, but at least it’s the bottom. Nowhere to go but up.

                “ …my local brewery. The staff is barmen/barmaids. …”
I must confess, the sexiest women I’ve met have been gravelly-voiced, experienced, middle aged barmaids in bars and honky tonks.  The young ones are cute to look at, but I’m under no illusions about keeping up with them.  The older ones, well that’s another story.

                I suspect part of the problem is due to the ubiquity of porn. People under thirty have basically been blasted with a firehouse of it since they first got their first screens. It’s not so much that they’re all onanistic, but that they’re insecure because the image presented in porn is that all women are perfectly groomed and beautiful, and all men are acrobats with big packages and tons of stamina. This is fiction, of course, but consuming porn is ultimately demoralizing for this reason. You never feel like you measure up (pun fully intended).

        The Derb’s old observations about the importance of innuendo and avoidance of explicitness I think explains a lot of “what’s wrong with the kids,” regarding sex. That sex is private—and derives part of its magic/sacredness from that privacy— goes back at least as far as the Greeks, to the idea of Hieros Gamos—congress between the Gods. This is part of what makes porn not just a matter of crudity or bad taste, but literal sacrilege.I’m not a Zoomer, but even as a Millennial can tell you that internet pornography has really hurt a lot of young men. It’s certainly hindered them from finding mates, and—as Derb pointed out—it’s robbed sex of its joy, which is perfectly acceptable for married couples. See Martin Luther’s own observations on his relationship with Katharina von Bora. The left loves to mock the right for prudery but once the tatted blue-haired sex positive feminist wakes up one day forty and with no kids, it stops being funny.As for a code, the best western I’ve ever read—Lonesome Dove—has that powerful scene at the end, where one man is dead and another remains. A woman wants the man to stay with her, but the man promised his friend he would get his body home to Texas. “But he’s dead!” the woman says, in essence. “You and I are alive!” But the point the man knew—and the woman couldn’t understand—was that if he didn’t honor his dead friend’s request, he would be more dead than his friend in a very fundamental way. That book was worth more to me than all the PUA Heartiste (Roosh Vidal) crap and Jack Donovan’s Rogan-esque, eat-elk-meat-and-wear-a-loincloth crap. Good riddance to that whole phony scene. Until they start posting recipes on how to slow-roast flank steaks carved from Ben Shapiro’s scrawny little torso, I’m not buying it.

                    “…tears to my eyes…”
Interesting.  The thought immediately occurred as to how many books and movies of the past do such—not just LD.  Why?  Because what once was, and was commonly accepted, is no longer.
We are indeed a degenerate society long stripped of decency and integrity.  These “glimpses of the past” remind us of such and therefore become even more poignant.

                        No question about it. A sense of loss can be agonizing. And certain literature and film elicits that very form of grief. Not always pleasant, but unfailingly cathartic.
In relation to that, images, depictions and sensations of profound beauty can also call forth sorrow in this comprehensively hideous epoch. The present cuts a mighty poor figure when compared to the past.

                usNthem:  I was never a big fan of westerns, but one of my husband’s friends taped the tv airing of Lonesome Dove and mailed the cassettes to him overseas.  We then watched them together while dating, and I read the book a bit later.  Taught me to better understand and appreciate westerns, and a lot of other things.

            I think there is nothing less joyful than sex as described and discussed by the “tatted blue-haired sex positive feminist.” Read their articles on “polyamory” that they put out constantly, it’s like putting up drywall. I read an article by some wealthy Park Slope mom who wanted some “excitement” in her life, and what ended up happening was she ended up making a long list of rules to try to manage the bad feelings, jealousy, emptiness, and contradictions that came from it.So you basically have a culture where, on one end, you have men who are consumed and destroyed by pornography, which ultimately is just watching two people have sex in some rote manner and with which you need increasingly edgy stuff to feel anything. Then on the other end you have a bunch of shitlib women who turn sex into a fleeting, passionless enterprise, an endless quest for something it cannot provide on its own. Is it any wonder that millennials and zoomers are all screwed up and can’t pair bond?

            You only get a tribe if there’s some code among the members, which unifies them. The deception you see among Orientals is toward outgroups. If you’re disloyal to the ingroup, you get punished, either cast out or killed or mutilated so people can see your disloyalty at a glance (i.e. the Yakuza being forced to sever a finger and present it to their boss as an act of contrition.)The difference between Western people and every other people is Westerners thought these loyalties could be based on ideas themselves, rather than ideas created by certain people. The ideas can work as a unifying force, but only among people already unified in other ways. Otherwise you get fat Soros Shaniquas using Anglo-Saxon law to put men in prison for getting laid and making real estate investments. Take the Oriental and African elements out of the equation and you’ll see it still works fine.When the Framers mentioned our “posterity,” they should have added “THAT MEANS ENGLISH WHITE PEOPLE!” in parenthesis, as we were apparently too stupid to figure it out, or were so gullible or inviting that we forgot, or we grew so lazy or overconfident that we ceased to care or defend what was ours.It doesn’t matter how we got here. We have to get out.

                Benjamin Franklin complained bitterly about the Germans and Swedes that immigrated to America.  Too swarthy, uncivilized, caused trouble, not meant to be a part of that society, etc.  As did many others of that time.  The world of the Founding Fathers didn’t even last their lifetime.  Hell, Anglos of all stripes haven’t been the number one demographic in America since the 1800s.  Most white Americans are descended from those Germans who showed up, including virtually all of the Midwest.  Then you get the Irish and Mexicans and a few other demographics… And then somewhere down the line is the founding stock of this empire.

                        You misunderstood.  The world the founders built didn’t even last their lifetime.  Their ideals sucked.  It didn’t even last the introduction of other groups of whites, let alone anyone else.  The only way their world would have survived is if they didn’t let anybody else immigrate over.
