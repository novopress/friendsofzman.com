        I grew up in the Midwest.  The only Jews I knew were Mr. Zimmerman, who ran a shoe store and supported our school Christmas charity drive, and Mr. Bohm, who owned the camera store.  I referred to Bohm as my Uncle even though we were not related.  He helped our family through a rough patch.I knew nothing of Bolshevism, or the Frankfurt school.  The Jews I knew  were successful because they worked hard.  TRS has a heavy focus on the JQ because most of the founders of TRS are New Yorkers.To a Midwesterner, David Duke’s focus on Israel seems odd.  At times it seems like Duke prefers Muslims.  While this is logical to those who are red pilled on the JQ, preferring a violent culture like Islam to Judaism seems nutty.Most people don’t read very much past the headlines.  The echo meme was effective because it woke a lot of people up to Jewish influence.  Alt Right memes need to be tailored to the audience, and what is effective in one region may not work in another.West Virginia is full of whites, but they have traditionally voted a lot like mestizos.  Robert Byrd has half of the state named after him since he brought home the gibs me dat.  White areas of the country that are not doing well economically are a big challenge for the Alt Right.  These areas do not attract a lot of immigrants because the jobs are not there to draw them.  Jews are a distant abstraction, and the only blacks one sees are on TV.

                    “With the It’s Okay to be White poster campaign sending oy veys echoing around the world and Donna Brazile making good on the notion that non-whites are the perpetual blind spot of any serious political movement  (no really, let them into your inner circle and they’ll sell you down the river for a carton of Newports), the collapse of the J-left’s crumbling institutions continues to accelerate.”

        Having lived for considerable lengths of time in five of the American Nations, I can vouch for Zman’s observations.  These nations are as different as Dutch are from Germans are from Danes–despite all of the nations speaking English.  The differences lie in a deeper cultural place than mere language.When I see alt-right-ish folks poking at others, many times it is this cultural difference that is at its root.  Some of the alt-right luminaries are, at heart, provincial.  One might have globetrotted and now resides in the Old World, but their head space is still in Yankee-land, with Yankee-land predilections.  Spend some time in the delta or in the hollows or on the prairie and what white/western nationalism/identity means to them may surprise them.The alt-right/white-identity “thing” will have to bridge these cultural gaps.  Some peculiarities will have to be tolerated and some will have to be attenuated to make a go of it.  There will be plenty of time to hash them out after the crisis, whatever form that may take.

‘It’s OK to be white” does this pretty well.

            We lose sight of the fact that the country was founded on provincialism elevated to a principle. That was the Founder’s solution to Montesquieu’s dictum that the one thing a republic could not be was large. Plus. provincialism is the seed of talent and genius, universalism never. Yet the narrative reserves provincialism for the rubes and universalism for the sophisticated.

        Our side is still in the process of building itself. The flip side is currently more significant IMO, as there is little doubt the left hates white men.

            Liberal whites hate themselves. They must hate all whites to remain reasonably consistent. Low self esteem is a calling card of the left. Unless one is in charge, of course. 1st class all the way for the leading true believers.

                    Self hatred is not consistent with high self esteem. They do despise themselves publicly at every opportunity. They are merely proud to compete in the contest to prove who hate themselves the most.

                Get a load of this gem. Now we White people are supposed to open our hearts and make ourselves vulnerable for “White Wounding”, so we will have this empathy because our “White privilege” has hurt the world or something. Its double speak for justifying White Genocide.Try not to gag if you read it.

            Whats significant is the two “people desperately trying to commit cultural and demographic suicide” are people who have this fantasy they will rule and get there via genocide.I’m from northern NH Yankeedom and WV Appalachia. Both places have a lot in common. They just want to be left alone. Both smell a very dead stinking rat. And both are the type of American’s who you really do not want to piss off. Because when you try to force these dirt people, and that are realistic dirt people, they tend to be people who you can’t stop or switch off. And there are deep grumblings among the warriors in these two dirt people tribes.See, thats just the thing. This isn’t about safe discussions of culture via anonymous keyboards, this is the shit were rivers of blood come from. And my main point Im trying to portray. The “people desperately trying to commit cultural and demographic suicide”, have an agenda that has been responsible for more mass murder through human history than all other Marxian style agenda’s combined. The 20th century was a blood bath. Its the dirt people who fought that. Its the dirt people who will again fight this next one we are the target of.  There’s an acronym most aren’t getting, it’s “BFYTW”, which stands for Because Fuck You Thats Why. It means never say die, come and take them, our guns, our culture, everything, because your not getting them. We have a meat grinder we want to stuff you and your dirty stinking ideology into.Us dirt people are so far ahead of the curve no one in Normie land can see us. We have learned to live with less, we have hardened ourselves to whats coming, we have no doubts on this score, the only way this crap ends is by making rivers of blood. It is where this is all going.And it is us dirt people who have ever created positive change in this world. No one one else. This is our purview. Its our legacy also.There’s no winning against the marxian horde without us. All the Normies out there in whatever stripe, they haven’t figured this out yet. Still living in some altruistic dream of the past thats going to magically come to the rescue. God bless them. But they better wake up fast, times getting real short. There is nobody coming to the rescue.Its all of us who must find away to solidarity together who are our heroes who will rescue the West.

        Outstanding blogpost Zman.I don’t understand why the different factions of the Dissident Right feel the need to attack each other so much.  We’re all pulling in the same direction.  A Steve Bannon-style American Economic Nationalism may not achieve all of the goals of a Hunter Wallace or Richard Spencer, but it’s a heck of a lot better than the status quo.In the short term, we absolutely must stop the flow of third world immigration and deport the criminals, temporary refugees and illegals.  If that doesn’t happen, civil war is assured. The Trump/Bannon coalition is the best and only hope to make that happen.  As a side benefit, they’ll also discredit the media in the process and make our long term fight that much easier.In the long term, the Spencer/Wallace factions make a valid point that American Economic Nationalism isn’t an enduring, unifying philosophy and is likely to get watered down and co-opted over time.  Spencer and Wallace should continue to do their thing to try to build a stronger coalition based on stronger form of identity politics (white identity, southern identity, whatever works).In my opinion, the most important goal is to teach the basics of race realism.  Once you recognize and understand that globalism can’t work with 85 IQ third worlders, you will inevitably join the Dissident Right.

            One could rationally argue that economic nationalism doesn’t address the imminent demographic paradigm shift and voting patterns would bear this criticism out. America, for all intents and purposes, will be destroyed when Texas goes blue. And that will happen in the 2020 or 2024 without presently unthinkable immigration policy change.

        “No one knows if it is sustainable.”A small highly-paranoid part of me believes the upper-crust doesn’t care if it’s sustainable because they will just hole up in their bunkers if things go south. With the coming robot age, they will no longer need to rely on blue-collar folks for their goods &amp; services which makes them much more dangerous.

        Its all going to depend on a couple interrelated factors- first, the left continuing to flail about in incoherent screeching and recrimination while it eats itself in ever increasing radicalism. It has, along with its evil twin in the Republican political class, shown itself to be suddenly vulnerable. People who considered the last 50 years of political consensus and political parties inalterable and unchangeable have suddenly realized that, yes, the beast bleeds, and if it bleeds, it can be killed. That cannot be underestimated as a basis for a restoration of sanity.The second factor that will guarantee the shift back is the cold fact that leftism, in all its forms, is no longer avant garde, countercultural, or increasingly, fashionable among the younger generation. Rebelling against cultural conformity means gleefully breaking the Left’s taboos on race, sexuality, and religion. That is the tipping point we must utilize-the Left’s dogmas are old, tired, and soulless, and the more the schools force feed “diversity” to white kids, the more they will reject it, instinctively. Its up to us older generations to give them the intellectual tools to be principled counter-revolutionaries, not Jacobins or Bolsheviks.

        We will probably get a number of descendants of the “conservative,” right-wing, and alt-right movements, rather than just one.  And these will be in continual flux, each rising, falling, coalescing, and giving way to something new over time.  What is important is to be sure that each of these descendants and their descendants firmly promotes, at a minimum,  that it is OK to be white.Right now writing and distributing that message gets the police called and probably results in expulsion for college students.  This needs to change.  If it doesn’t, then soon writing — and perhaps even reading — that message will result in jail time.Yes, indeed, let a thousand honkies bloom!

        We are the first country to be ruled over by people desperately trying to commit cultural and demographic suicide.
Others beat me to it, but I think the race is still on and Sweden, Germany, Britain, and Australia are looking like strong finishers.
We are the first people, with a significant element that celebrates the extinction of our race.
If you include self-hating whites, I think others beat you there too.

                    The cloud people are all but invisible to some folks out here in flyover land.  From a struggling mid sized town in East Kentucky perspective, the cloud people don’t seem important at first.  Wal-Mart has done more damage to the community than Mexicans.  Highway project after highway project (bypassing the bypass route of the old bypass route), have destroyed more small businesses than Jews.  Consolidated schools have destroyed more small towns than blacks.  White people are not having children for numerous reasons, but when the community schools are gone, it is just one more pita to deal with.The ironic thing is that a majority of people in these towns will favor the Wal-Mart (cheap stuff), highway project (muh jobs), and giant mega-school in the middle of nowhere (for the children).  Of course the cloud people profit from all of the above.  Some in the Alt Right like too say that economics do not matter, but we need a message that resonates with people.

                        Great comment, Reactionary. Goes right along with James Wilson one above. I think some of the Greek reformers could see a bit of this and it caused them to form the demes, the Romans to have artificial tribes and Jefferson to propose small wards as political units.Of these those that were tried in practice needed up dying along with the  cultures they were in and one was theoretical, so nothing lasts forever, but if we were to have a mechanism whereby occasionally, instead of things continually getting bigger, there was some way to make them smaller, or keep them broken up while there was some form of expansion going on.An example would be enlarging a school district for taxation purposes but keeping school sizes restricted below some threshold level.

            “We are the first country to be ruled over by people desperately trying to commit cultural and demographic suicide.” There was a not insignificant amount of this contributing to the collapse of the Roman Empire. Empires do not inspire loyalty, and are not intended to. They rule by other means. Sweden, Germany, Britain, and Australia are satellites of an empire, a failing empire. Eighty years ago Orwell was writing of the type who bring this about, English intellectuals who hated everything British and had no affection for their country. Now that is universal in the EU.

Voxday, the komic book kommando, is super butthurt over comments Zman made about his 16 point plan for world domination.  It’s too funny, really.   The guy spends all day talking about comic books and yet considers himself the second coming of Aristotle.   I would bet money he has a special made outfit he wears while pontificating on one nonsense thing after another.  He has the mentality of a 13 year old fat kid, lost in his own little fantasy world.

        Speaking of cultural suicide, Sailer had a good piece today (Nov. 8) on the Times trying to explain the Air Force Academy race hate hoax. He asked what percentages of hate incidents are actually real, and not hoaxes. I would bet less than 5% are real. It occurred to me that there are a number of people on this blog with the research and stat skills to work this out. If you fall in that box, read Sailer’s piece and give it some thought.

        I think you’ve hit the key to the greater alt-Right.It is a coalition – anti-Immigration, southern nationalism, traditional values, are all distinct and separate, but confederated against a common enemy.Many of the 11 (sub)Nationsare on the same side v.s. the elite and globalists, but for unique and distinct reasons.

        “We are the first country to be ruled over by people desperately trying to commit cultural and demographic suicide.”I think there are many examples from the Roman Empire that would argue against this. But, again, we are not ruled over by our own people anymore.“We are the first people, with a significant element that celebrates the extinction of our race. These are events so outside the norm of human history, there are no examples in the past to rely upon for guidance and solutions.”I also disagree with this. The French have been on this path since the Revolution. The difference between European countries that have already given up and the US is that when a European country began to decline, there was another White country in the wings to take up the slack. Now, there is no White country anywhere that can fill in as the preeminent power in the world

            I’ve never agreed with the Roman Empire example. The Romans incorporated barbarians out of necessity. They worked hard to spread them around the empire to avoid sectarianism and tribalism. Basically, they used integration to wipe out troublesome tribes. At no time were the Romans hoping to wipe out their own people nor did they pretend that anyone could be a Roman. The Romans arguably bankrupted themselves defending their borders. It’s just a very bad example in so many ways.As to France, French was not the first language of most of the people in the kingdom at the time of the revolution. France was, and to a great degree still is, a country of regions. They are not even ethnically the same. One product of the French Revolution was a strengthening of French identity and the submission of the regional identities to the national identity. The radicals committed genocide in the Vendee in order to stamp out regional identity.

                I thought about the Roman thing, too and saw both of the comments regarding it. The thing that made me think otherwise was remembering the time of collapse under Romulus Augustulus. Rome itself was still exclusively Roman.  And even in the succeeding centuries Roman families tended to keep to themselves. They didn’t mix in with the invaders.

                    I would guess that a major reason that the old Roman families didn’t mix with the invaders (Goths, Lombards, etc.) was due to religion – the old Romans by the time of Romulus Augustulus and thereafter were Catholic Christians. The invading Germanic tribes were mostly Arian heretics.

                Like I implied, we are not ruled over by people desperately trying to commit cultural and demographic suicide because “we” do not rule our countries anymore and those that do are trying to commit cultural and demographic murder. But,“After Gibbon, others, for a time, pointed to barbarians as a contributing factor. More recently, historians have pointed to economic factors, arguing that aggressive taxation destroyed the empire’s economy and finally the empire itself. But what really happened? The answer, according to Oxford historian Peter Heather, is that unchecked immigration and invasion led to the gradual dismantling of the empire. Heather tells the story of this massive and crippling wave of hostile immigration in his new book, The Fall of the Roman Empire. For modern Americans grappling with issues of empire abroad and facing the beginning elements of unchecked immigration themselves, the book is fascinating, if somewhat disquieting, reading.”https://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+immigration+destroyed+Rome.+Oxford+historian+Peter+Heather+has…-a0141907543If you want, you can read some of the similarities between the West today and the Roman Empire. I don’t want to post it all. But, the takeaway is this:“There are two major lessons to be learned from the fall of the Roman Empire in the West, and these are made apparent in Heather’s book. First and foremost is the danger of uncontrolled hostile immigration. That the empire could absorb large groups of immigrants is beyond doubt. It could and did do so over several centuries. But even the Roman Empire, with its vast territory and unprecedented wealth, had a limit to the number of people it could absorb and Romanize.”“Eventually, the immigrants grew more powerful than the existing Roman authority and, maintaining to some degree their independence of spirit and character, were unwilling to relinquish their own culture and adopt the Roman. Vast blocs of once-Roman territory eventually became foreign and even the preexisting Roman population, eventually outnumbered, had to make peace with the newcomers.”“This is a stark lesson for America. The United States faces its own immigration dilemma with very large numbers of immigrants moving in but resisting Americanization. Our modern situation at the Rio Grande is not so different from the Roman situation at the Danube circa 376 A.D.”From the 3rd century onward we see a trend to accept the installation of barbarian tribes inside the borders. And while at first they had to follow Roman law, they later got the right to keep both their leaders and their own political structures, giving them a wider sense of freedom toward Roman power, ultimately leading them to hold the only power in the areas where they settled.Also, it was the Emperor Caracalla in 212 A.D. that instituted the policy of citizenship for ALL freemen of the Empire. Prior to that, those living in the far-flung areas of the Roman Empire were aliens and exempt from paying tax. Caracalla’s “generous” gift was a farce.  In reality, he just needed more tax revenues and more military recruits.As far as the frogs are concerned, I’ll just say this:“Liberté, égalité, fraternité”Talk about suicide. France has been pushing that SJW hogwash for almost 230 years now.

        I find it interesting that you say that the Southern Nationalists have little interest in the JQ. I stopped reading Occidental Dissent several years ago because of the virulent Jew-hatred expressed there, more from commenters than from Hunter Wallace. I followed your links there, hadn’t read that site for couple years, and it’s still the same. A particularly nasty Jew-hater named Denise is still commenting there.

            I was not thinking narrowly of Wallace’s crew. I should have been more clear. I think the average honky in the south who is feeling the call of identity politics is not all that worried about the Jews. To be honest, I think Wallace is probably a yesterday man, but we’ll see.

                “Honky”?  For somebody who is always ragging on the boomers you sure talk like one.  That word was self-parody when used in the era of blacksploitation films, the 1970s.   Why would any self-respecting white person adopt the slang and patios of the urban negro, especially to describe themselves.

        Thank you for that map Zman. Many tend to forget that European nation states once composed of many, many different groups (we can name them as tribes or nations) speaking different languages with different customs. Example, France, Italy, Spain had many regions where inhabitants spoke regional dialects but not the “classical” French, Italian, Spanish. United States is similar. I do not think someone from Deep South has anything in common with someone from NYC or Jersey for example. English is the lingua franca but they are very different types of english. Sometimes I wonder how this United States will endure as one nation under God.

            The Southern white folk have much in common with their white peeps in Ohio. Both have been hammered by globalization and immigration. The same applies to the white folks such as Sailer, and other s here in California  with those in Ohio, George and the Mid-West folks.The fact that we’re separated by thousands of miles, we do share lots of things in common if you’re talking about blue collars and middle-class folks. Globalization, immigration and even big box stores wiping out our local businesses are just a few things we have in common.You want more?Contempt and frustration with local government which isn’t honest or responsive. Public schools that no longer answer to the public unless it’s minorities doing the complaining.We are all disgusted with D.C. and their cabal of elitists and oligarchs that appear for all intents insane and hate our guts.The same with Silicon Valley going nuts promoting our demographic destruction.and censoring us.

        I’m from the Left Coast, my wife is Honduran, and I’m learning Spanish.  I’m actually positive about the future.  I love pussy, and if we fill up our country with Latina pussy, I’m cool with demographic change.
But no Asians.  I don’t want any Asians coming to the USA.

        Your ideology is unappealing to everyone except for a few white men
Gillespie tried it on in Virginia and lost to a guy who ran an ad calling people like you racist murderers. That tells you something right there.
It’s why a democrat will win in Alabama. America is changing for the better and the youth do not want your racism

            The actual Virginians voted for Gillespie, however, it wasn’t enough given the immigrants, the blacks and the Federal employees.  Same thing in Maryland.  NYC voted true to form.   We love posts like yours, Ned, because you confirm that our thinking is correct.
