        The Global American Empire doesn’t seem to like Muslims being Muslim in Muslim countries, but love and fully support being Muslim in White countries.

            They very quickly morphed from “fight them there, so we don’t have to fight them here” to “collapse their civilizations there, and invite them here”.

        We have accepted sketchy elections for so long we no longer believe in honest elections.
We accept a weaponized legal system, Kafka like taxes andbureaucracy, and adversarial government at all levels.
Colonial America would have grabbed muskets or at least tar and feathers. Now we’re so fractured we can’t trust our neighbors to have our back. Indeed, there’s a good chance our neighbor is an alien and likely hostile.

                Covid had the same effect on me. It revealed close friends as feminized cowards and society writ large as totalitarian yet dysfunctional at the same time.. In turn, a vicious but also incompetent government was emboldened. Covid likely was a Regime psy op that yielded the desired results from which the government concluded it could do anything despite its dysfunction and incompetence, which of course has led to crisis and soon to systemic failure. It is simultaneously terrifying and interesting to watch.

                    I tend to have a slightly rosier take in that they wanted much, much more, but were unable to get it.  For instance they really wanted to push the vax down the whole DoD supplier chain but got stuffed in just trying to get the “primes” to get their people to submit.  It showed there is a real limit to what they can do, and that, actually, that’s the kind of tolerance that recedes rather than expands as it’s stuff that a lot of people will only let them get away with once.

                        I would hope that’s true but fear it’s not. They likely will do a repackaging of the same concept sans the medical aspect. I did see green shoots in how a sizeable percent of people and geographical areas would not comply but will that hold up with repackaging? Dunno.

Your perspective is within the realm of possibility.
Again, at this point in 2020 the Beer Flu hoax was in full swing. The attempt to restart that, as well as substitute Bird Flu haven’t even come close to what was happening in 2020.
Summer of Love ’24 has also been a failure versus 2020 when we were a couple weeks into the Floyd op.

                    COVID made me realize that most people want to be ruled. They want a strongman in charge to tell them what to do. They get told what to do, they do it, they don’t think, and they are happy. It doesn’t even matter how draconian, overbearing, or, dare I say it, “un-American” it is, as long as they consent to that person ruling over them.I am not even going to say I am any better. My ancestors spent thousands of years being ruled over. I tend to think the monarchy is the natural organizing state of human civilization. The difference between them and me is that I did not consent to be ruled over by Anthony Fauci and Kathy Hochul. What it tells me, though, is just how unnatural and silly this whole “our democracy” project is, and as Plato discussed, it is destined to descend into tyranny.

                    This is because almost nobody will impose a cost on the borg.  Say what you will about leftists, but they always and always have imposed costs on things they didn’t/don’t like.Had Biden not been installed in early 21, it is likely that vaccine passports, if they had been implemented at all, would have met fierce resistance by the leftists.  This probably would have been via rioting.  Since our side is not prone to rioting, a different approach would have to be done.  Like we could judge shop just like they do and then hold things up in court.  But we are simply not willing to do stuff like this.The reality is, the left wants stuff a lot more than we do.  They’re willing to pay both in money and other ways as well.  They have a whole “diversity” of tactics ranging from passive resistance and lawfare all the way up to extreme rioting when appropriate.  They have many, many organizations all around the country that also have a “diversity” of methods and funding.  They impose costs at every level.  Just people charged with wrong-think in the CJS cannot get anything but a court appointed lawyer.  That is because leftists make lawyers pay a price for representing a wrong-thinker in court.

                        @Tars – Leftists also have the most important ingredient: unlimited funding from NGO’s, pumped full of Federal Reserve notes.  NONE of the crap they are pulling could have happened without the unlimited lube of cash greasing their organizations.

                    Maybe I have good instincts but I immediately saw the “lab leak vs no lab leak” to be some kind of limited hangout.
Whenever a conspiracy seems to be seeded, I always feel that the truth is actually far worse.
I know I sound like Alex j but I think us intel had a lab in China that intentionally released a virus to either genocide Chinese people or to frame China.

And I’m not the same either. My misanthropy quotient, which hovered around 65 in 2019, is now in the neighborhood of 90.

                    I get this — on my part I am not estranged as that takes more energy than these folks are worth on my part. Frankly, they have been revealed to be so solipsistic, childlike that there really is no effort required to remain neutral’ or ‘gray’ if you will.
A better term for me would be “bored” as in bored shitless. Was ‘man’ really made to age into becoming paunchy, compliant, and medicated? Like ‘Flounder’, but without the fun parts.

                    My husband and I are not estranged from any of his family, although we all choose to keep a courteous and healthy distance.  By my choice, we have had minimal contact with any of my family for many years.  But we really don’t know many otherpeople who can berational about whether extended family is a positive or a negative in their lives.  People feel obligated (often by their parents since childhood) and will wreck their own lives and marriages out of presumed ‘duty’ to siblings and cousins. We’ve both seen it countless times with friends and acquaintances.  Fortunately he and I are of one mind on this – they are all best kept at arm’s length.  We choose whom we will trust and expend time and resources on.

            When things get hairy, the government has to go in with an absurd amount of force to feel safe. No one is going to do anything to defend our government if it entails any personal risk.In turn, the people are showing less and less willingness to comply with their governmentThis means more and more resources need to be spent for compliance by a bureaucracy that is becoming more and unwilling to take decisive action.It’s a slow quiet quitting where, slowly, things just stop happening.

            It is sad that some old friends and even family members can no longer be counted on.  We all do the dance now of making new friends and trying to figure out where they stand and if they are dependable.

                @MaxdaThis also ties into how a “return to the office” never really panned out.  The CTO of my large company tried to convince employees that we were all going to return to the office and things will go back to “normal”.  It never happened.  The one or 2 times I went into an office before my company decided to ditch it was “uncomfortable” at best.  I work in tech so it is over run with leftist shitlibs.  It was a very awkward dance between people who were attempting to discern if you were a mask wearer, did you vote for Trump, are you an evil white person who doesn’t worship the criminal race, are you against women, etc.  I found this to be unbearable.  I don’t think I could ever have another job where I need to go into an office ever again.

Dunno, being honest they NEVER could be. Unless I donned my rose colored lenses… and even then. Let’s just say they went from unreliable to useless and laughable, one booster at a time.
Maybe there is a brain worm at work? It seems some of my relatives are regressing.

        The country has always been split between the independent “Don’t Tread on Me” types and the hyper-conformist fanatics. For a while, this was fine, as there was plenty of space for independent people to stretch their legs by expanding to the frontier. The moralizing classes simply didn’t have the technology to force everyone to conform to their worldview in such a vast area.The increasing complexity of technology has allowed the busybodies to gain the upper hand, to the point where they have near total cultural and economic hegemony, and it’s showing no signs of stopping.Just look at Mexico’s new president, and you see the global cultural conquest of the GAE is proceeding just fine.

            I generally agree. The internet is truly a novel thing. It is not just a better version of past things. The printing press, which was just an improvement on the scribe, lead to revolution. The internet is likely to do the same, but maybe worse.

                    This was, indeed, my first thought. The total erosion of our border redounds to the benefit of the cartels, so she will get no flack from them, rather the opposite.
I always thought that AG Holder’s gun running scheme was a way of communicating to the cartels, “Hey, we can do business”, and not at all a law enforcement strategy. Still think that.

        If you look at what’s going on in Atlanta, you can see the next few decades coming into focus, everywhere in the US. Whites spiritually gave up on this country in the 1970s and spent 50 years sending everything of value abroad. Now things will begin to break — big things, like water, as in Jackson MS and Flint MI. Nothing can stop this, as we are dealing with physical laws here.It’s like we’ve been living in a comic book. Nobody has to pay attention to basic things. We’ve transcended that state; we can dwell in ideology and conceptualAuseinandersetzungfor the rest of time.What a stupid, stupid people we are.

            I’m unfamiliar with the latest mishaps in Atlanta but it is a good example. It took half a century of black/Jewish rule before the city, once a shining example of what white culture produces, reached its predictable final and dysfunctional stop. The rest of the country and the west generally are just a few steps behind.

                I’m also unfamiliar with goings on in Atlanta, but can well imagine. Atlanta is, what, 60 percent negro? No city with that demographic marker can long stave off rampant dysfunction of every stripe. As Metcalf said, it’s a physical law. Myriad other cities will follow suit in the coming years.

                    Last i read so years ago, Atlanta was a city where all government jobs were in the hands of Blacks—Whites having fled to the “burbs”.  The article was along the lines of illustrating/explaining that the government was the primary sponsor of a Black Middle Class, how the government was completely filled its ability to supply any more patronage jobs, and things were beginning to decline.

            Atlanta is a dystopian, crime-riddled, black-run hellhole that is kept afloat by the taxes robbed from the shit-libs in Buckhead who were prevented from leaving the city and forming their own. Other than sodomites and weirdo shitlibs, the city is nearly 47% black, which is past the tipping point. The black population has gone down in recent years because the ones who can afford to leave have decamped, like the whites, for the suburbs. What they don’t realize is that they’re simply bringing their dysfunction out to the ‘burbs.My family lived in the ATL burbs for more than 20 years and we decamped a couple of years ago for the Blue Ridge and have not regretted it one day.

                Lived in Cherokee County / worked downtown in the 90’s and early 2000’s.  It was almost rural 30 yrs ago – just another burb now.  We decamped to upstate SC in 2006.  Travel back to the ATL on business routinely – it is as you say.  The news always the same – mayhem caused by the usual suspects, or infrastructure  breakdown – the most recent being the water main break and concurrent state of emergency.  The boil water order is concentrated on the heavily vibrant south side – so the broken pipe is racist, and just because…and since it’s pride month – a broken pipe is also homophobic.

        The trouble is, we lack a label that seems to fit what we are seeing.Don’t know about that one, Z Man. I mean, I’m not the sharpest tool in the drawer, butLeftist Tyrannyis one label I always use – because it is. If I want to make the sword a bit sharper, I may useAnti-White TyrannyorGodless Tyranny. They’re short and simple; that said, there is always the chance that a listener doesn’t know what a ‘Leftist’ is, but you can’t win them all.I have absolutely no doubt that the rejection of God, as well as the incredible hatred for Him, is one of the (if not the main) driving factors behind our decline. The other day, I was thinking about the joys of ending and completely reversing non-white immigration – how good it would be. Then a thought occurred to my basic mind:Sure, we’ve sorted the demographics problem, but we still have our incredible, self-inflicted moral and religious decline to attend to. It’s no doubt brilliant that I can walk safely about without being jumped by a murder of spades; but still got Leftists everywhere.I believe the solution (which will be painful, I think) is effectively God, Family and Community. I’ve had positive remarks about the way I carry myself, and how happy my kids are, which I’m truly grateful to have received. Start as we mean to go on; and never stop thinking about the Next-Evil-Round-The-Corner.

            It sounds like a Happy Stoicism. A positive “in the world, not of the world.”
Happy and grateful for the day and for the small things; not resigned, not bitter, nor afraid of distant things.  Still looking forward to life happening.
I rather like “I’ve had positive remarks about the way I carry myself, and how happy my kids are, which I’m truly grateful to have received. Start as we mean to go on,” ever mindful.
I just wanted to say thanks. That was a nice way to start a Monday.

                Alzaebo,
Thanks for the kind words.
The World is in a fallen state. But it’s been rotten for far longer in times far, far before ours. I’m under no illusions about the horrendous evil being perpetrated by Western Governments, but there are many, many positive things a person can do, at least from their own perspective.
Plus the most important thing: nothing regarding our future is at this point set in stone. Nothing.
Happy Monday to you, Sir.

The trouble with those labels is that eventually you come to the point where you have to ask yourself, “well, whoarethe people who hate both white peopleandGod?”, and at that point you get de-platformed from everywhere for noticing.

        I am truly at a loss to explain how homosexuality became the highest, noblest, purest, and holiest sacrament of our Official State Religion, to the point where military officers, U.S. Ambassadors, corporate CEOs, politicians and media figures all have to profess public adulation for man-on-man anal intercourse.I am old enough to remember when kids screamed “Fag!” at each other on the playground as they were punching the hell out of each other. “You fem!” was another schoolyard insult.I am also old enough to remember when “liberals” sneered contemptuously at Christian Bible-thumping rubes who believed in creationism, insisting that man was a naked ape who evolved out the primordial slime from the Big Bang.Well, I have yet to see any evolutionary biologist explain the evolutionary purpose of depositing half of the future generation’s DNA into another man’s anus — which, according to what i was taught by biologists, evolved to excrete feces from the colon.It’s The Science. Yet we hear crickets from the actual scientists. I guess they have their rice bowls and if they want to get paid, they don’t question the Party Line. Just like the USSR — if you wanted your tenured sinecure instead of the gulag, you accepted Lysenkoism.If I had to hazard a guess as to how this came about I would say that the decoupling of sexual relations from procreation led to pure sexual hedonism as the foundational principle of Western “civilization.” But the policy toward homosexuality is not one of “do whatever you want in your own private bedroom,” it’s “everyone MUST publicly celebrate this and elevate it to the highest status.I can’t grok it. I refuse to accept it. Frankly maybe it is simply Satanic and deviant.

They will accept any outrage, absolutely anything, if it comes from an “expert” or someone on the TV.When you tie these things together you get Anus Worship and all the rest of it.We have always been at war with Eurasia, comrade, and 2+2=5.

                I think you may be noticing some of the same stuff I did in my post above yours. You can identify the source of the problem as the working ofLuciferean cults or call it a network of NGOs and think tanks. The end result tends to look the same.

            Anyone surprised the zulock thing hasnt gone to trial yet? The reason I bring it up is that I see it as a teachable moment that gays have issues and they need to self police.
My guess is that the prosecution doesn’t want the kids testifying (b/c they don’t want them reliving it) and maybe doesn’t want the case to go to trial b/c there might be more crazy stuff that gets revealed.
Don’t be surprised if there’s a plea deal where they do 40 years instead of a life sentence

            Worship of sexual deviance is neither genocratic nor phenocratic. Thus, when naturalistic explanations cut no ice, one must fall back upon the supernatural. Satan, in other words, may well have a paw in all this.

            The best explanation that avoids recourse to the supernatural is that the unleashing of female sexuality led to a great number of women spending their youth chasing Chad Thundercock. This meant that a sizeable number of men would never even get close to “qualifying” for women’s newly expanded minimum standards of wealth, charisma, and physique.I realize that this is a “pressure relief” theory of homosexuality and that current dogma states that gays are “born that way”. However, thousands of years of experience in wars and prisons (and of course the English public schools), suggests that something like this is a big part of what has happened. Why is the society so insistent that everyone must worship at the gay shrine? Because without the normalization of homosexuality, a large slice of young men would remain unhappy and embittered and this is a recipe for unrest at best and revolution at worst. History also shows that feminism comes first and “gay rights” tags on after women are sufficiently “liberated”.In other words, there actually is something to the Left’s intersectionality gibberish. One can think of a given society’s morals as a net with various weights tied at the mesh points. Cut one of those ties and the whole thing bounces around until a new equilibrium is found. This is why the Left’s color revolutions tend to look that same everywhere. They are simply trying to force the new equilibrium by always cutting the same ties and adding the same new ones.This may also explain why the modern “Left” is often surprisingly militaristic while the old Left was often pacifist. They are attempting to march every nation into a particular sort of parade formation. That formation is “liberal democracy”. Needless to say, some countries need to be marched there at gunpoint.

        I still remember, a month or two after 9/11, seeing a “Welcome Ramadan” sign out in public. I had no idea what Ramadanwas. I had never heard of it. Muslims just weren’t athingin the United States before then. Of course, they existed, but as a very tiny minority of people that were in major cities and pretty well integrated in public life. Nobody really thought about or cared about Muslims or the religion. Then, after 9/11 and Dubya’s wars of choice, they started flooding the country and setting up ethnic enclaves where they are absolutely not assimilated. Bringing over millions of these people after, according to the people bringing them in, they attacked us and wanted us dead, is insane – so the only explanation has to be that it was all intentional.Obviously bringing Muslims into White neighborhoods and calling the Whites “Islamophobic” (a word that nobody said ever, if it even existed, before the towers went down) if they object was absolutely part of it, and something they’ve been doing for a long time. It seems, though, that the people doing this also saw bringing the Muslims into the USA where they can be introduced to drag queens, homosexuality, pornography, and feminism was a prime goal too. It was like killing two birds with one stone, part of the project of healing the world.

        Lesbian and gay, the L and G
“Gay” has never been used as solely specific to men. Lots of women describe themselves as “gay.” So isn’t the L entirely redundant?
Anyway, I don’t really care what we call them so long as we start persecuting them again.

            You hint at the conundrum all these Leftists eventually run into—their own contradictions.
We most always spoke in the distant past of Homosexuals in reference to males, and for females we used the term Lesbian.  However, now that the Left claims there is no such thing as biological sex differences, the term Gay is the appropriate moniker.  Lesbian is sexist and should not be used.    😉

                    Those are “their” words, like n*gg*r (sigh. moderation.). Dykes call each other dykes all the time, but you are not allowed to.Queer used to be that way, but it has mostly come into common use. All it means is “not normal,” because they definitely don’t want to be normal. You can call yourself queer even if you are a woman who only has sex with men, or a man who only has sex with women, because it sprinkles a bit of rebellious cachet on your otherwise hideously normal practices. You just have to pretend that youthinkabout having sex with all the other colors of the rainbow.Bi functions the same way for girls. There are few bi guys, because if you’re a guy who says he’s bi, some guy might at some point expect to stick his dick in your ass or your mouth, and that’s a lot more commitment than lesbian rubbing and licking.

            It’s all so tiresome. Local TV news spends ten minutes each day gushing over the “Pride” parades as if faggotry were some exciting new miniseries or irresistible novel flavor of curry. At no point do we ever hear about Pride’s staggering levels of promiscuity, drug use, sexual disease, pedophilia… what horrible lives they lead compared to the boring straights. If you have any of these beautiful acronym people in your family, you probably already know how broken they are… even in a society that bends over backwards to accommodate and praise the love thatdare not speak its namewon’t ever shut up about it.

        If the various pathologies infesting the body politic were the result of some kind of revelatory impulse at the foot soldier level, we wouldn’t expect foreign nations to be imposing the same pathologies.If Covid lock downs and Anus Worship and tranny flags and White soopreemacy were all the bugbears of zealots at the lower-to-middle level management level, how can we explain their prevalence across every single nation of what used to be the White world?I am often confused when I encounter a point of view which takes for granted that all the consent engineering, all the government fiats, all the Hector ‘n’ Lecture media sermons, are all occurring organically because individuals got a wild hair up their asses and suddenly decided it would be great to start chopping mammaries off.If this is all motivated by some misguided revolutionary zeal on the part of cranks, by do these same cranks never adopt Causes that might actually benefit normal, well adjusted people? Even by accident? You’d think out if 7 or 8 billion people, every once in a while some jack wagon or other would hit on an idea that made sense.It appears inescapable to me that everything we see — every movement, every cause, every decision– is imposed from the top down by central authority. This implies a conspiracy, an idea bolstered by the uniformity of the policies forced down our throats from nations and cultures different from our own.“You see, Ivan Ivanovich, people are disappearing into the gulags because the kommisars decided to try stricter enforcement policies. The kommisars see themselves as the Grand Re-designers of policy, and so they all of a sudden, without any motivation other than a vague, nearly supernatural coincidence, began to implement wildly destructive, utterly Satanic practices of murder and ruin. Just out of nowhere! There are no authorities who direct their decisions, and they are acting in an organic way which can only be explained by this elaborate theory of Crusading spirit. Let us talk about the kommisars, Ivan Ivanovich!”

Yes. And that central authority is Satanic in it’s nature.
The idea that the exceptionally powerful and wealthy wouldnottry to influence things as it sees fit is daft. The idea that these people are interested in the ‘good of the people’, is equally as farcical.

            Sort of like how the entirety of the “western” world (save Sweden) imposed the same plandemic measures, at the same time. Somebody gave an order. And the swing state counting stopped at the same time. Curious.

        The interesting aspect of all this is that the new Movement is Global, whereas our prior manias were confined to the US. Through our cultural hegemony, we will make sure every truck stop and remote village is safe for the alphabet/rainbow.
The irony is that our Elites demand to control the realm of ideas while the realm of Dirt collapses under the weight of DEI, neglect, incompetence and debt.

            I think the impulse for the “Movement” as you term it, has been explicitly global ever since the surrender at Appomattox. As soon as the Yankee abolitionists had wrecked the South and freed their first, most beloved mania, they immediately sought to meddle in the rest of the world, sending the Protestant missionaries to China and determining that Mexico, the  Caribbean and Central/South America needed some “freedom”. We took up the White Man’s Burden from Cuba to the Philippines.  Then Wilson screamed that America needed to “make the world safe for Democracy” in the next generation, and Wheels Roosevelt cranked it up to 11. There’s never been a time since 1865 where American manias have been quarantined to the United States.With God’s help, we will lift Shanghai up and up, ever up, until it is just like Kansas City…Senator Kenneth Wherry (R, Nebraska), 1940.

                    Word up, yo! I diligently strive to increase cogitation.Incidentally, it isn’t just our beloved domestic Bagels who applied that mania to Russia in that same time frame, when it was Russian. The Yankee Protestant elites hated Russia and Russians almost as viscerally from the 1880s and 1890s, long before the Kagans, Kissingers, Morgenthaus and their multitudinous cousins slithered into the corridors of power in the mid 20th century. Sweaty Teddy Roosevelt did everything he could to be as ostentatiously pro Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 in a way that has echoes in the slobbering over Our Second Greatest Ally today. That little smirking prick Lindsay Graham would have sat down with Prime Minister Katsura and gleefully forked over American money to the Japanese, if it kills Russians.

                        You may be onto something. The Cold War is generally reckoned to have begun immediately after WWII. However, the truth of the matter is America adopted a hostile pose–perhaps at least partially justified–against Russia directly the Bolsheviks took control. I’d always assumed Marxism was the casus belli. However, I suppose Russophobia may have been a gravamen. The question is, why did American rulers hate Russia even before it became a Marxist state?

                            Pick a reason. Imperial Russia wasn’t Anglo-American, Protestant, Western, Progressive, modern, or anything that the American political and cultural elites prided themselves on being. Sound familiar? Russia, to them, was literally an alien land full of medieval, barely Christian Slav barbarians where serfdom, famines and bloody revolts staggered along under a despotic monarchy. And they once had a foothold in North America, and always represented a threatening presence in the new frontier of the Western Pacific after 1868, exactly where Gilded Age America wanted to swing around their newfound power. They had a different alphabet, a different calendar, and the average Russian was, then and now, denigrated as a drunken, illiterate moron who was not European. It was everything that Yankee Puritans had been taught to despise about Southern slaveowners and “white trash” rednecks and hillbillies, transplanted to ethnic Russians, who were flooding into America in the late 19th century until 1913. The Slavs were the new Potato Irish, but infected with more dangerous politics in Socialism and there were millions more of them back home in an empire that could be far more dangerous than tiny Ireland could ever be.

        Really, “fascist” in the original Italian sense isn’t all that bad a description for most modern Western governments. But it is literally unthinkable for them to acknowledge that they are fascists, because fascist means “bad,” and they are “good,” so all meaning had to be drained from all political labels lest people notice how we are being governed.

                What most separates current_regime from fascism is that our system has no leftist intellectual heritage. There’s no “workers’ determination” (or even voters’ determination) of anything. The worker/citizen is bound to/by industry and state, but they’re wholly free of him.
Workerist rhetoric does pop up in weird places—the US military internally described the Canadian trucker protest as “anti-worker” terrorism (really)—but the purge of economic leftism fromeverything, even actual existing communism, has been remarkably total.

Two problems — there is no such thing as “leftist intellectual” anything. And our current system lacks intellectualism of any kind.
You make the mistake of confusing/conflating national and international socialism. Fascism is about blood and soil.
Like the DR, fascism was never about the welfare of any individual Italian or German, but rather about what was good for them as a people. DR is an ideology fully as much as any other system which sets out to tell people how they should construct their society, i.e., no nogs, chinks, pajeets, etc.

                True. Although I would argue we should not respect the Left’s corruption of language and instead proceed with speaking, thinking and writing in correct and accurate fashion. We’re in a ghetto anyway. Might as well be a ghetto where communication and linguistic usage is nomothetic rather than anarchical.

            Fascism – whether German, Italian, or Spanish – was always about doing what was best for that specific country’s dominant race and culture.  So it will always be bad in the eyes of Western governments because their aim is to do what is worst for the Germans, Italians, Spaniards, and white Americans.

                Spain wasn’t Fascist, and Italian Fascism seethed with militarist pugnacity—which is never about doing what’s right for the nation’s people. Relevant slogans included…• La guerra è per l’uomo come la maternità è per la donnaand• Se avanzo, seguitemi; se indietreggio, uccidetemi; se muoio, vendicatemi.There’s also that famous Fascist slogan which can be used without modification by any Marxist fanatic, too. Mussolini was one of these before he had the bright idea to take a shortcut to power, one requiring no proletarian uprising. He retained his totalitarianism, though, as you can see plainly:• Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato

                    Thanks for the Italian refresher— my second language. I like the second slogan and I could fight alongside men who lived it on behalf of their nation. I am not a Fascist, but I can admire that they fought the Reds.an off topic rant:Way back when in my early 20s living in Italy I was fascinated by the multiplicity of political parties and in a way started sorting out my own place in American politics. The left (PCI, PSI) were definitely out. The center left (PSDI, PRI) seemed reasonable , but I had an aversion to them because they were soft on what was then a tiny incursion by Africans.  The Liberals reminded me of GDP worshipping US Republicans .  The Christian Democrats were corrupt as hell and toadies to the US, though I really wanted to like them. So, I ended up Fascist leaning (MSI Movimento Sociale Italiano and Protestant that I was, its splinter party Democrazia Nationale). I would have preferred Christian Democrats if they were honest and had balls.The rightists were more serious and better all around to hang out with, but of course leftist girls were more fun on vacation.   Oh, and the Radicals (think of our contemporary Democrats without the nasty edge) that wanted to legalize weed, abortion, and prostitution and put an immigrant porn actress in parliament — fools. Before they left the scene I’m sure they put a Nigerian pimp and a Brazilian trans prostitute in parliament.It will never happen here but I wish we had a choice of 8-12 parties. I would love a coalition of a White party, a Conservationist party, a Worker’s party, an Evangelical Christian party and a traditionalist Catholic party, and regional parties all over.  Make them each earn their support.  It would have to be an improvement over what we have

                Right, @Maxda.
Lots of people misunderstand, thinking that fascism is, for example, about the good of the people, when it’s really about the good of the collective, and, to the more cynical, the good of those at the top of the heap.
Fascism has never shed any tears about the misfortune of the individual.

The prophets are clowns, perverts and grifters. Or worse. That is the hell of these things; eventually all the worshippers end up in the Outer Darkness…and discover they like it there.
interestingly I’ve heard that one of India’s major religions has gone into full collapse because the “untouchable” class (caste) walked away from their moral and intellectual superiors…
We will be getting new prophets soon. I dunno if that is a good thing or not…

        The logical end of the Great Awakening is the End Times.  Hence the mad rush to WW3.  It’s also why a lot of our evangelical friends seem so hell bent on bringing about the apocalypse in Gaza.  It’s the same mindset, but from different perspectives.Evangelicals are always excited about the second coming and, growing tired of waiting, want to give God a nudge.  The Great Reset people hate humanity and believe everyone will be better off with a lot less of it.The neocons straddle these groups and herd them in the same direction.If they don’t kill him (which is the next logical step), and Trump overwhelms the safety systems in the 2024 rigged election, getting both of these groups out of Washington and the West in general is going to be like dragging the Japanese out of the tunnels and caves.We are seeing fanaticism in its purest form emerge.  And they’ve now granted themselves the power to accuse anyone they want of anything they want, call it a “crime”, and then rig the courts do that only they are allowed to participate.  That’s lunacy, and it’s why Trump collected &gt;$200M since the verdict.We always describe the Government Party as having an immune response to outsiders which is a bit like a virus having an immune response to the host.  We may be witnessing the proper immune response taking shape where the body politic rejects the End Times virus.Which aptly explains the fevers and delusions.

            I am a Christian, was a member of an evangelical church, not now though. I’ve never understood the hurry of a certain group of evangelicals to bring on the End Times, it seems to me that they are trying to usurp God to get what they desire. It’s not their place to end the world, it’s on God’s schedule and trying to rush it up seems like rebellion against God. The whole worship of the Chosen is another departure from God I think.That insane, compromised Speaker is the biggest tool of the Neo cabal right now. His End Times insanity will very possibly get us all killed. For that, he and many others are dooming themselves in the afterlife.

            It’s truly fascinating how few people seem to realize that the opposite of a wrong idea isn’t necessarily a right idea.
The woke fanatics and the Biblical literalist zealots are both equally the enemy of any human being that actually possesses a soul.

        The time is fast approaching where we must transition from diagnosis to remedy because simply cataloging a disease is not curative. The persons and forces implementing the various forms of insanity as detailed in today’s post are neither trivial nor benign, and they are committed to an endgame in which a lot of harm is done to all. And we cannot beat them with magic words or an illusion that voting matters. History teaches that the cure must be done the old fashion way, but this time with the aid of modern technology. We are ancestral innovators with a strong work ethic. That is our super-power. There will be a rising. You need to decide which side you will be on and plan accordingly.

Say’s who?  Certainly not the Left.  The cure is to simply remove/change the classification, and viola—no more disease.
I distinctly remember when as an undergrad, learning that homosexuality was a mental disorder, as listed in the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders”.  That was removed over the years as have other mental diseases which are now considered “trendy”.  I have heard recently that there is a push to delistpaedophiliain the next publication.  🙁

            I like to think Billie Joe was a visionary and what they were dropping off the Tallahatchie bridge was a copy of the 1964 “Civil Rights” act.

                    Yeah, that’s what I meant. He was a visionary. He saw far ahead and just couldn’t accept living under an overpass and getting  beat up by vibrants driving around in BMWs in his declining years.

        Excellent article. Deranged fanaticism does seem to be as American as baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet. And it does seem to have become more unhinged and virulent since America became the planet’s lone hyperpower in the post-Cold War era. There simply are no checks and balances, domestic or foreign, left to constrain the madding cohort of Karens, cucks, negroes, heauxmeaux and Finkels. God have mercy on the planet when a demented mob rules the world.

We’ll know that we’re making progress toward the goal when no leader, wannabe leader, public figure, restaurant owner, etc. has reason to fear telling Jews, Levites, and so forth to buzz off like horse flies when asked to affirm friendliness toward the State of Israel or to the supremacists indicated inExodus 19:5-6.

            Not quite.  They need whites in order to maintain what little of a first world society still remains in the west.  Instead, what they will demand is unrestricted access to whites while reserving the right to also have access to their own spaces.  Whites are and will continue to be the only people who aren’t allowed to have access to their own spaces.

                Yes, this. “Untouchables” are an evil necessity in many cultures. The problem with this version is high intellect and ingenuity. Successful implementation of such a system actually would be beneficial for Whites in the long run but it is impossible. The United States, where this would originate and spread to its vassal states, at a generous most has a decade or so left and that also has to be taken into consideration.

                    Folks, we may not agree with Metcalf, but let’s not ignore the real life example of SA.  As soon as their Black majority assumed complete control of the government (took a few years due to the turnover agreement signed in 90’s), they began to pass discriminatory laws which specified a limited number of Whites in government and other employ, particularly managerial positions.  This I’ve read *has* caused inefficiency—at best—and failure—at worst—of institutional function. See recent discussion of the national electrical grid.

                        Compsci,The failings of SA are well known, indeed. But there are so many examples still that would stagger most. Examples of egregious black-on-white racism; of government incompetence and evil; of previously prosperous private sector companies being driven into the ground.If you ever come over to England, London specifically, you’ll find shed loads of SA folks in South-West London: Richmond, Putney, Twickenham. I’ve never met a nicer bunch of fellows, and almost all of them were frank about the “benefits” of black government.My own take is that most of these emigrants to England from SA were those of English heritage. I didn’t meet many of Dutch heritage, but am told they certainly have a very strong racial identity. Whether it is enough, I don’t know.On another note, it strikes me that, a well organized white resistance in SA would likely completely dominate the current black Anti-White Regime… the issue is that the US, UK and the rest of Europe would enter the fray.And who’s side would those Devils be on?!

                            I’ve noticed that the “English” Whites were more likely to flee SA than the Afrikaner Whites. The English Whites are also more likely to be shitlibs. I don’t know if there’s a correlation, between the shitlibbery and the fleeing.

That said, I thought that maybe the Dutch ones just went back to Holland; which is why I didn’t see them in London.
I spoke almost exclusively to SA blokes, and a few ladies. Almost all were angry with blacks and what they get away with.
A girl I used to know was of Boer heritage. Her father and brothers were all unrelenting in their criticism of blacks. She moved to England, and seems to have had all the PC beaten into her!

                I can guarantee we won’t be allowed to have our own spaces.Our women, and for the worst, our children. Our women are the highest prize in the known universe. Our children…that is unmentionable. And as you say, our men make the most talented slaves.I’ve called whites ‘the fair flowers meant to be spread.’I see nonwhites now as ‘hardy weeds breaking tough soils,’ enabling those fair flowers to take root. Neanderthal’s job was to eliminate the obsolete Erectus types so that the next stage could grow.No wonder they resent and hate, yet envy and lust for us. We were both to violently eliminate their worst, and then became the next stage, of mercy for the rest.  That too has been twisted, twisted back.We are the replicants in this movie.

My thinking here has always been simpler (simplistic?). They hate us because as long as we are around, we can be used as a comparison point—both as to what they are and what they can never be.  Most of what we see occurring around us can be interpreted as the result of a “leveling”effort against the White race and its accomplishments in society.

I beg to disagree. Who wants a tatto-ridden obese slut with bad personality and tons of entitlement? You seem to think that American women are Anne Hathaway in The Princess Diaries.
Let’s say that your women have the potential to be the highest prize but American society and them work very hard to go to the opposite direction

        “US State Department forced Scott Ritter off plane headed to Russia and confiscated his passport
“As I was boarding my flight out of New York I was pulled aside by three CBP officers, who seized my passport. When asked why, they said orders of the State Department. No further information was provided. My bags were removed from the flight, and I was escorted out of the airport,” the former US Marine intelligence officer told Sputnik.
Ritter was slated to participate in the annual St.Petersburg International Economic Forum as a guest speaker.”

            When you’re on the “right” and/or a dissident, I can’t think of what possible good you could do yourself by traveling to Russia. The regime doesn’t even need that as an excuse to label you a Russian propagandist. Actually setting foot there could give them grounds to accuse you of something more. (assuming they need grounds, they could just lie). I noticed Sundance posting pics from his (her?) trip there. Didn’t strike me as overly smart.
But I appreciated Carlson’s interview with Reade. He’s probably big enough to get away with it. I think.

It is Holy Writ, which takes rhetorical form through what Americans take to be History.“American Civil Religion is inextricably linked with the Reformation, Calvinist Christianity, and the bloody history of Protestantism, with America’s sacred narrative shaped and christened through the country’s first and second Great Awakenings. Although its scriptural reading became secular in the Progressive era – the American religion still remained tethered to its formative roots. Indeed, even our contemporary “Church of Woke” cannot escape its original Calvinist Christian tubers”.“Since 2014, a rapidly-growing new sect—“The Church of Woke”—has sought to transform and fully possess the American civil religion, to reign as the successor faith. Ironically, the fervour of its evangelism channels the post-millennialism of the First Great Awakening, whose messianism was codified in Novus Ordo Seclorum (New Order of the Ages)”.”https://strategic-culture.su/news/2024/06/03/the-coming-novus-ordo-seclorum-change-we-must-there-is-no-choice/

            The link between progressivism and public Protestantism in America has come in and out of fashion since Mencken. I wrote about it ten years ago but moved onto other topics. Now it is coming back in fashion again. There is also a big overlap between it and Jewish social activism. Many of the same themes you see in Jewish “heal the world” activism exist in American public Protestantism. The success of the neocons, to a great degree, has rested on this overlap.

                “Many of the same themes you see in Jewish “heal the world” activism exist in American public Protestantism.”Yes, Kunstler wrote an essay on it last year –https://kunstler.com/clusterfuck-nation/the-jewish-american-dilemma/“For the Jews who arrived here in the late 19thand early 20thcentury, America became even more of apromised landthan that sliver of Biblical real estate on the Mediterranean. They succeeded here beyond their wildest dreams. Why dream idly about returning to the Middle East when the USA turned out to be the realLand of Milk and Honey? Hence, a revision in American Judaism became necessary.Next year in Jerusalemwas replaced as a central animating principle by an alternate shibboleth:tikkun olam.Tikkun Olam meansrepair the world. This has been driving American Judaism since the early 20thcentury.”

            I’m intrigued. The 95 Theses are mostly about how the official church has misinterpreted scripture, and, not only how it should be interpreted, but also how Catholic teachings (at least outside the Vatican) are at odds with early church practices and beliefs. Luther didn’t reject Catholicism; he died believing he was a Catholic.
It was the Catholics who insisted on the separation, believing that, for example, one could bribe his way into Heaven. (Indulgences.)

            I think you are overstating things. My own take is that is good which serves as a nuclei of formation about which resistance to our genocide can coalesce. Bad is that which serves to facilitate our genocide. Most Protestant denominations and most of the Catholic Church fall into the latter category at this time. Collaborators with the Jewish campaign of white genocide, no matter how unwitting, can not reasonably expect warm regard.

            It’s what happens when Christians lose their religion, and that can be traced back to the Cross. It has different characteristics for different ethnicities, but it’s the loss of religion. EMJ calls it the Jewish revolutionary spirit. It could as well be called the Antichrist revolutionary spirit, as some Hebrews (or Jews) didn’t reject Christ.
The Crucifixion is central to Christianity, so this loss of religion is also central to it. It’s why Christians obsess over Jews or think they’re Jews. It’s Christianity’s contradiction.

            The IA’s we are getting are products of Cartel smuggling.  They are transported all the way to the border, or beyond for $$$.  However, the way it works is that upon arriving, they or their family *owe* the Cartels.  Without a job, or a family, the IA still owes and will be killed, or his family members killed if he doesn’t pay.  What do you think he will do without a job and a gun pointing to his head?I sat on a jury once that described the workings of a Cartel-like organization that fronted drugs to addicts, i.e., get high today, pay tomorrow.  When the addict did not pay, they were rounded up and driven into a high income neighborhood and told to burgle homes.  The van then met them a few hours later to pick them and their loot up.  Of course, the addict got no profit but to pay off their debt.

        The origin of this crusader mindset can be dated to the abolitionist movement when all of a sudden, northern Protestants decided that slavery was a sin, even though Scripture seems to be fine with slavery.I’m afraid that this take on American history is just absurd. The issue of negro slavery in the Americas had been contentious from the very beginning. It was mostly discontinued in the northern colonies long before there even was any United States. It had been a hotly debated issue at the constitutional convention, resulting in the famous 3/5ths clause; and the subsequent unfolding of American politics was completely woven through and permeated throughout with a long list of debates and compromises over the “peculiar institution.” There is a reason why American history textbooks have subheadings talking about the Mason-Dixon Line, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and the “Great Compromiser” Henry Clay.Nothing happened “all of a sudden” in 1860. The attitudes that solidified in those years had been brewing for a long, long time, and it wasn’t merely about slavery, either. It would be more correct to say that “slavery” had become a catchword that had subsumed into itself all the political problems of the day and fed off the bad blood accumulated over many decades. The question at issue was not just whether negros should enjoy full political rights in the American polity, but the whole future economic and political organization of the country. The actual abolitionists were few in number, and they were preaching to people who already had axes to grind.It would be well to remember this before framing America’s current problems in terms of some random “new religion.” That is not the way that history works, now or then.

                    I am Matt Beck, and I did not dox myself, accidentally or otherwise (well, except for just now, of course).Z-Man’s commenting system has just doxed me despite the fact that I never entered any such information into the website. That is fairly alarming, unhelpful, and unprofessional for a blog of this nature. In fact, my comment originally said “Edited by Intelligent Dasein.” I know; I saw it. It only changed to “Matt Beck” at some later time. So, not only was it an unauthorized dox, it was astealthunauthorized dox, which is wholly unacceptable and for which I believe I am owed an apology.You’re right, it doesn’t matter. I was eventually going to dump the pseudonym anyway when I started publishing under my own name, but now the prerogative has been denied me. In the meantime, everyone else should be careful using the editing function, and if anyone wants to use this occasion to harass me or my family, know that I will not tolerate that.

        Ah shucks!  Late, I mention the important thing: the Sampson Option.
Israel’s “Sampson Option” is a fake just like Saddam’s WMD stocks were. Show me please the receipts and testing for 200-400 missles developed at Dimona.
Doubtful, since they destroyed South Africa rather than pay for the uranium supplied. I’m not hearing the cyclotronic whine of plutonium enrichment either. They may have one or two that they’ve stolen.
So what is the usual method of a permanent minority that gets its larger enemies to kill each other?
Make Russia or the US fulfill the Sampson Option.

            “Facts” or when more honest, recommendations are often pulled “out of thin air”, to use the words of Malcolm Kendrick in his bookDoctoring Data, an excellent overview of chicanery in all things medical and public health. This book was written some years before the Covid-19 disaster, but all its warnings apply, and indeed were amply illustrated with the still-unraveling fiasco.For example, how many of these sound familiar? That you should eat five servings of fruit and vegetable daily, that you’re obese if your BMI&gt;30, that you’re at risk of alcohol dependence if you drink more than “X” drinks per week, etc? Kendrick went to great lengths in some cases to track down their origins.In fairness, some of these are surely relatively harmless, or even helpful; No one would go far wrong if they eat at least five helpings of fruits and veggies per day. Also, some of that advice may simply be a best guess, much as the illustrious professionals who dole out the counsel would have one believe otherwise. Now, I’m sure there is some science behind most of the numbers, at least one should hope so. For example, thresholds for various diagnostics, or dosages for drugs. But let’s face it folks, a lot of this advice is pulled out of somebody’s ass. Oftentimes the collective ass of several “experts” who, despite having unquestionable credentials in their field, usually also have blatant conflicts of interest and effectively are promoting or even mandating what they will will personally profit from. These “guidelines” often have the de-facto force of law and those imposing them have zero accountability to the public they rule over.And at least in some cases, the results might – and in some cases have, per Kendrick – resulted in the needless deaths of tens of thousands of patients. Or even millions: Kendrick makes a good case that early in the 20th century, the doctor who first formally described the heart attack also counseled how to treat it: several weeks of mandated bed rest. This advice apparently was well-meant, but based upon zero evidence. Although this was not (to my knowledge) a government mandated standard of care,  it became widely accepted and few dared, or were allowed, to question it. Just one little problem: In retrospect this was just about the absolute worst course of action that could have been chosen, and over a period of several decades it probably led to the premature deaths of millions of cardiac patients.
