        Don’t dis Peterson. He’s more effective than you are and makes a lot of sense. I’m a financial supporter of you, but he has reached far more people and changed more lives than your smallish blog.

            By your type of fallacious reasoning, Jordan Peterson shouldn’t criticize Karl Marx — because Marx has had a far greater and more meaningful impact on far more people than Peterson could dream of having. Take note that Peterson criticizes Marx quite profusely. I suppose such commentary must be entirely invalid.

            I agree that Peterson can motivate some people towards questioning our current system, which is necessary for us to ever turn this thing around.On the other hand, he has said that his purpose is to prevent young men from radicalizing, especially on the basis of race, which I believe is our only way out.  No significant group of non-whites is ever going adopt colorblind civic nationalism.I guess the hope is that Peterson can plant a seed and then the plant will eventually grow beyond what he intended.  That’s what happened to me with Derb, as much as I still admire and like him.  No one blame Derb for how I turned out!

                Funny how folks like Peterson are never found living in Englewood (the sowf side of Chicago) or Garfield Park (the Wess side).
It’s been stated before that if Good Whites had to live among the luggage testers (my new favorite term), they would have a different perspective.

        No more liberal democracies? Au contraire, mon frere!” I may be going back into the lion’s den, because I have written a lot that would put me the wrong side of the law. But I have written it here in Costa Rica, where there is a constitution based on the US model, and two of the articles of which (I think it is 29 and 30) essentially mean that even as a non-resident I can write what I like about who I like and publish it where I want. That will not be the case in the UK, where they will be on my trail. ”https://counter-currents.com/2023/01/catch-2022-that-was-the-year-that-was/

            From the article: “2022 was what I have called another “accelerant” year, particularly concerning the United Kingdom, which is slavishly following, as it always will, the strange cultural commands of the United States, our bastard child, our Frankenstein’s monster. ”
No country has ever had or will ever have freedom of expression.It’s always qualified .
Latin American countries which try to adopt the US model generally become a disaster .

        In other random news, it has emerged that Ashli Babbitt’s murderer was housed afterwards for several weeks at Joint Base Andrews in a suite usually teserved for Brigadier Generals and such:
https://www.judicialwatch.org/taxpayer-dollars-spent-to-house-ashli-babbitt-shooter/
He even had a pet with him, and the authorities were so thoughtful as to pay his fucking bills for him every 10 days.
Any questions?

            The murder of Ashley Babbitt by that incompetent negro should have been a serious wakeup call for white people in the US..  The murderer has been treated as a hero by politicians of both parties and the media.
The incident clearly demonstrates how much the ruling elites hate whites.  It is time to hate back.

                Why are you calling Lt Byrd who murdered Ashli babbitt, “incompetent”?  That implies he just made a “Whoopsie” and accidently Killed her.  He went on NBC and bragged about the killing.  He was malicious.
And he was cleared without having to answer any questions during the So-called “investigation”.  Chauvin got sent to prison for 20 years for the death of Floyd.  Byrd gets a medal and a handshake from Pelosi and Mitch McConnell.That’s our power elite.

            I’m kind of surprised they didn’t disappear the guy. Lon Horiuchi, the FBI HRT-oft-claimed-Delta-operative sniper who killed Randy Weaver’s wife at Ruby Ridge and was also at Waco, TX, hasn’t been seen in over 20 years. Not that I’ve been able to ascertain. Reading through that article it sounds like Lynd got cabin fever and couldn’t take the isolation.

        Off topic:  Six year old boy arrested for shooting teacher at Newport News elementary school in Virginia.  Per schooldigger.com, school is 46.9% black, 14.7% mestizo, and only 24.1% ‘White.’  I doubt they’ll ever identify the kid directly, but I’m sure one of his dindu relatives will be interviewed at some point.

            The give away is the apologetic tone of the coverage.
Remember;
When the offender is not identified, it’s probably a pavement ape.
When the cause of death is “sudden” and unexplained, it’s probably the Jab.
Anyone see a pattern here?

            I attended high school in Hampton-Newport News VA.   It was a living hell.  The negroes hated us whites with a passion and would attack anytime they had a numerical or size advantage.  (It was many years ago and there very few Hispanics at that time.)It was essentially prison, except we got to leave at the end of the day.  It was a horrible  experience,  but I did learn survival skills and the true nature of the American negro.I would love for leftist whites to attend high school in Hampton-Newport News for one week.  I doubt many would make it past the first day.

                Yep, it’s ironic that we decry so of modern segregation and racial separation, but it is exactly that—limited as it is now—which keeps up the pretense of racial harmony.  If all the “good Whites” actually had to live and work side by side with our minorities, we’d have none of this nonsense.

        I too am seeing in Southern California a marked lack of people on the roads at normal workday hours. At the company I work at, there are still many who mostly work at home and I hear that this trend is fairly widespread. With gas prices sky-high most in SoCal try to drive as little as possible. So that might be part of it, the thing is likely lots and lots of gig work. I had to have some work done at my place, finding someone was very difficult and expensive. Most contractors simply did not have the people and were cutting back as they got older, and had no replacements.Segue — as I predicted there is an arrest warrant (from Iraq) for Trump, for “murder” of Soleimani. Any takers for how quick Biden sends Trump (and some of his backers) to Iraq for “trial?” After all, it was Biden who said: “I’ll paraphrase the phrase of my old neighborhood: The rest of the countries, the world is not a patch in our jeans, if we do what we wanna do, we need to do.” I rest my case.Particularly as we have 40K troops in Poland along with about 90K Polish troops just waiting to go fight in Ukraine, Belorussia, and Russia. Trump has promised to use the military against the cartels importing drugs, that can never be allowed to happen. The FT is filled with articles about how they stopped worrying and learned to love the bomb. The world indeed is not a patch in our jeans.

            Here in and around my western NY metro the roads are as crowded as they’ve ever been. There is no such thing as ducking out to run a quick errand in the morning or afternoon anymore.
Gas prices are higher than states like PA, OH, IN, and MI, but not completely outrageous. I just managed to find 90-octane, ethanol-free gas at the station attached to the local supermarket.

        California legalized infanticide with Assembly Bill 2223, by Assemblyperson Buffy Wicks, and signed into law on Sept. 27, 2022 by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The exact words:“This bill would delete the requirement that a coroner hold inquests for deaths related to or following known or suspected self-induced or criminal abortion, and would delete the requirement that an unattended fetal death be handled as a death without medical attendance. The bill would prohibit using the coroner’s statements on the certificate of fetal death to establish, bring, or support a criminal prosecution or civil cause of damages against a person who is immune from liability based on their actions or omissions with respect to their pregnancy or actual, potential, or alleged pregnancy outcome, or who aids a pregnant person in exercising their rights under the Reproductive Privacy Act, as specified.”Link:https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2223

            Note: The pro-aborts are saying AB 2223 will not bring about infanticide, because it supposedly allows inquests by coroners. But the bill will be enforced and interpreted by the state’s pro-abort AG, DAs and judges. George Gascon is not going to arrest anybody for infanticide.

Sadly, the crystal ball of darwinian nihilism currently indicates that the genes for sadistic psychopathy are on the rise and headed for near-term dominance in our society, so matters are likely to get even worse before we can turn the tide.

        “Where are the people?”
Well, I recently had a connecting flight cancelled along with two sets of flights across the entire terminal. I had to drive a third of the way across the country to barely make Christmas eve dinner two days after my scheduled arrival. The pilots were there, we heard them say there was no ground crew and the FAA wouldn’t let them exceed their flying hours.
I always today, accept the sinister explanation. Vindication:https://www.amren.com/news/2023/01/us-faces-pilot-shortage-as-bidens-transit-sec-focuses-on-racial-quotas-for-the-skies/

                Remember the lesson learned from the Boeing 737 fiasco.  The plane’s software now makes take off and landing at the touch of the icon—except when there are unusual problems, then only skill, experience, and immediate action can save your ass.This means that indeed, one can force lessor qualified minorities into the cockpit, but eventually the passengers will pay a price, a high price.Is there anyone that believes in our “woke” corporate environment and with the shortage of airline pilots that airlines would not kill for qualified minority pilots if that could be found?  The logical conclusion is that qualified minority pilots are not available and therefore an increase in their numbers is a decrease in passenger safety.Of course, such knowledge will never be allowed to be known regardless of the number of crashes experienced in the future.

            RealityRules:  My husband drove 1200 miles over 2 days for a requisite (disliked but unavoidable) business trip.  We won’t fly anymore – refuse to mask or risk a pilot being a vibrant or dying suddenly, or the risk posed by dindu brawling in the airport or in the air.  All of his colleagues – who flew on various airlines from various locations – had flight delays.
Traffic wasn’t ‘fun,’ but he was at least alone in the car and stopped when and where he wanted.

            So I have a story for this one too!I flew over Xmas right before that Southwest disaster hit. There was no delay but as soon as I boarded the plane I got a sinking feeling in my stomach when the captain came on to tell us flight time, weather, etc. SHE did the announcement.Mercifully, it wasn’t in ebonics as I’m pretty sure I would have deplaned immediately but female pilots do not have the best track record in the world. It is once again, that law of averages thing. Women are simply worse at spatial physics and there is a mountain of data to back this. Hence, stereotypes about women drivers exist for a reason. Women pilots? Adding that 3rd dimension… yikes.A second thing I noticed immediately after the high octave voice telling me where she was flying us, shortly after take off the plane started making significant lateral movement. This was in a fairly light crosswind. So my alarms bells went off slightly more. It takes more than a stiff breeze to push a jetliner sideways but here we were zig zagging through reaching cruising altitude.Flight was fine once we got in the sky lane. Now its time to land, and of course this is always the hardest part for the inexperienced pilot and doubly so for the wahmen and unattainably so for Shaniqua.Once again, tremendous lateral movement in a mild crosswind and I’m thinking, “this is going to be interesting”. And it was…I’m watching as we are over the runway and naked eye guestimating I’d say we were at least 50-100 meters above where we SHOULD have been at that range and speed. Plane had a seriously high angle of attack too like she was afraid to nose down. So I’m watching as we are nowhere near safe landing speed, 100 meters high, and the runway is starting to run out and buildings are approaching.Right at that moment I was like, “Is this b-tch going to plant this into the terminal or what?” and a half a second after that she floors it. Full throttle ripped back on the yolk and we go screaming off into a sharp climb. Passengers are like W T F.  It  was obvious to me she either wised up we were about to be out of runway or, more likely, the control tower waived her off like “are you insane?!”We had to get back in the pattern to await attempt #2 so another 30 minutes in the air. I described what I was seeing out the window to another passenger next to me who was a little shook. He was like, “you talk like a pilot, can you go knock on the door and see if you can help land it?” LOL!We DID make the 2nd approach after being waved off on the first missed one, but damn if that wasn’t a prime example of a strong empowered diversity hire doingexactlywhat we fear. It will only get worse once Tyrone and Laquita get there hands on the yolk and throttle.

        One aspect of that VDare story is how the NY investigators are weaponizing the law and subpoena power to harass, bankrupt and or imprison dissidents.This is one of the biggest problems in modern America.  The law is no longer neutral, assuming it ever was and cannot be counted on to produce just outcomes or even a just process.  It’s not just who gets charged with what and who gets ROR released from local jails after arrest and who gets multi-million dollar bail. It now includes the weaponization of prosecutor’s offices, police departments, jails, judges. The whole thing is weaponized.  VDare gets investigated, the bail project gets ignored.

            Anecdotally, when my ‘incident’ happened my bail was set at $100,000 for the high crime of sending a text message someone didn’t like. That is how upside down the whole thing is.
There are nig-nogs committing armed robbery bailing out for WAY less than that, and many are being let out with no bail at all today. As you said, its a very bad time to be a white guy caught in the criminal justice system,especiallyif there is an sacred minority involved too. You have no rights.

            Yeah, Letitia “Mammy” James has been really bad about vindictively weaponizing the NY AG’s office against political enemies. She even sued to dissolve the NRA as a corporation, thankfully the court rejected that one. Meanwhile black felons who commit shootings with illegal guns get released on recognizance and illegal aliens are given legal protection against ICE.
But this is what happens when you have an ultra-left wing state, a colored woman in a position of power is beyond reproach for stuff that would get a white man impeached.

        Watching the local Buffalo news this week has been excruciating.  Covid laid bare the complete feminization of our culture with its emphasis on risk avoidance of any kind, but this recent story has been the cherry on top.  When they’re not directly talking about the unfortunate luggage tester who got felled by the clot shot, they’re obsessing over the “impact” this event has had locally.  The Bills players are constantly on TV moaning about how they’ve spent the days since in each others’ company, coping with what they witnessed.  Schools have brought in counselors to help with children who may have witnessed the event.  They interview psychiatrists from local colleges to talk about the effect this has had on everyone and constantly pimp 1-800 numbers so that those who were traumatized can get the help they need.  The local hockey team is pressed to describe how this has hit them hard too, because…they’re also millionaire jocks?We’ve raised two generations (and the entirety of the NFL is now comprised of Millennials and Gen Z) that have been told that victimhood is a badge of honor, and we see it in this event.  Just last week 40 people froze to death in Buffalo, but that got knocked completely off the news because this event has allowedeveryoneto vicariously play victim and reap the dopamine hits for dealing with it so bravely.This sissification of our society won’t be cleared until we meet some truly hard times.

            I find all this counseling stuff rather strange.  My second experience with death happened when I was very young, maybe 7. One of my friends and schoolmates died of leukemia.  It was a Catholic school and he lived on my block and so basically every kid I knew went to the funeral.  We all cried and then went back to class.  Dying is part of life and is inescapable.  Learning on your own how to deal with grief is “good.”But what’s up with this grief by proxy?  Some guy dies on a football field you don’t know, you never met and have ZERO connection with and you weren’t even there when it happened.  Kids really need counseling for this?If anything, I believe any attempts at trauma/grief counseling will cause more harm than good. Not only from lack of growth, but by arranging some aspect of your life around the grief counseling.

                “I believe any attempts at trauma/grief counseling will cause more harm than good.”
I believe grief consulting is basically a scam or grift (grift counseling?).  Anyway, just another pseudo science and it’s practitioners are turning a buck in today’s society with their faux degrees.  Years ago we had grief counselors—they were known as priests, ministers, and rabbis.  They worked well enough.

                Reminds of when Princess Diana died here in the UK. I was amazed at all these thousands of azzholes weeping over her as if they knew her personally. Pathetic.

            Sissification is certainly an issue, but it’s also true that sports are simply an entertainment choice. While fake deaths in film media can be entertaining (or at least interesting), a real death during a live match is pretty much the opposite of entertaining. It’s an unsettling buzz kill, so it’s not insensible to stop play and move on because the entertainment factor, at that point is zero.

                No complaint here, it’s simple decency.  However, the aspect of entire teams and such hiring grief counselors and the pathos expressed might be a bit much.  And we will not see the worse displays here, since the “victim” lived and will recover. Had he died, we’d have memorial services now and until the end of time!  (How could we all share in the victim hood without it?)

                Hey Drew, be patient with me for taking this off topic but your comment seemed to be a good place to do it. The news is for everyone.Here’s a little inside gossip about the Army. I’m a private school teacher, and one of my seniors who graduated in May of ’22 entered the Army last summer. In his basic training group he finished as 3rd best recruit, and the top three were given their choice as to which “school” they went to next. He chose Airborne, and was accepted. He had already trained as a mortar man. (He came and visited me at school in December, which was nice of him. He even told me I was his favorite teacher; I don’t hear that sort of thing very often.)Today at lunch one of my fellow teachers told me, “Did you know that B is being sent to Poland? He had been accepted to Ranger school, but his training has been postponed because all of the 100 mortar guys he trained with are being sent to Poland instead.”I’m no expert on military matters, but that seems like somewhat ominous news. Are the powers-that-be going to kick things up a notch? Or am I making something out of nothing?Anyway folks, just thought y’all might be interested in that little tidbit.Have a great weekend!

                    (((GAE))) will neverevermiss an opportunity to throw more Europeans and White boys into a Brother War meatgrinder. Nothing makes them happier, in fact. (See WW 1 &amp; WW 2)Killing muslims is fine too, but the real hard-ons are produced when you have white on white mass violence. Been 75 years so they are getting a bit thirsty for mass European bloodshed I would think.I hope I live long enough to see Mustache Man Part 2 and the complete eradication of this pestilence, it is painful to think about how many needless deaths of European boys &amp; men have been offered for these monsters.

                    As much as I hate to admit it, my sympathy for the cannon fodder in this is non-existent. They had the ability to see what they were getting into and still joined. I refuse to feel bad about any American or NATO deaths in this. We are the baddies and I have an idea we will get our asses handed to us.
I truly hate that whites will die but by their actions they will be judged. They wouldn’t be on our side anyway so we will move on without them.

                        My guess is that the average age of the kommentariat at Z is somewhere between 40 &amp; 60.There might be a few younger guys in their 30s, and surely a few older guys in their 70s, but I think the bell curve probably peaks around the age of 50.POINT BEING that likely none of y’all oldsters thought thoughts along the lines of “I had the ability to see what I was getting into and still joined”, when you were 18, the summer after you had graduated from High School.Maybe if you were a Boomer, born say in 1950, so that when you were 18 years old you were in the High School Class of 1968, as the Vietnam war was raging.But if you were born in 1950, then you’re pushing 73 now.And the youngsters you’re pissing on are about FIFTY-FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU.Maybe you should look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself why you didn’t scream even louder at them to NOT sign on the dotted line at the recruitment orifice?Hell, why didn’t you just chain them to the steam radiator to keep them from leaving the house in the first place?

                    American troops have been in Eastern Europe training the locals, including Ukrainians, for a long time.I personally know someone whose daughter was an ROTC Army captain in an arty unit and she got sent to Ukraine to train them — and that was something like five years ago. She’s out of the Army now. ZOG has been stirring the pot in Ukraine ever since they overthrew Yanukovich in 2014, last year’s events should have been been no surprise to anyone.I cannot say this with any personal knowledge, but I have no doubt that the Pentagon is directing practically the entire war with regard to intel, targeting, and so forth. The Ukes are just pushing the buttons.You really don’t think that the Ukes took out the Russian cruiser and bombed the bridge in Crimea and blew up Nordstream all by themselves on the orders of a Jewish comedian, do you? They paid all that bribe money to Hunter Biden for a reason…

                        Dennis Roe: “They need WWIII to hide the fact they just tried to kill all of us.”Setting aside the question of just how bad the v@xxine carnage will ultimately prove to have been, that sentence works both as fanciful facetiousness and as deadly seriousness.Would that be the rhetorical hallmark of Klownworld; that we can no longer distinguish between the two [facetiousness and seriousness]?Sitting here right now, it would be a 50/50 coin toss for me to try to guess whether you were being facetious or being serious when you typed that sentence.I wonder whether sh!tlibs still retain a sense of facetiousness in them, or if the virtue-snivelling cascade has now become so psycho-sociologically omnipotent that shi!tlibs no longer retain any memory of what facetiousness once was?Virtue-Snivelling is very very serious business.Deadly Serious.PS: Or is the rhetorical hallmark of Klownworld that facetiousness will get you sent to the gallows?I need to think about this dichotomy.There’s something strange going on here, which I can’t quite put my finger on.How can facetiousness be mistaken for seriousness, and seriousness be mistaken for facetiousness?It doesn’t make sense.There’s a piece of the puzzle missing here.Likely something to do with surrealism.

Sur-Realism ought to be more of a transcendent phenomenon.
Sous-Realism on the other hand would be eponymously guttural in nature.

                On Monday we had teacher meetings at my little hillbilly private school down in Dixie. All anybody wanted to talk about was Damar Whoozit, with thoughts and prayers, etc. I wanted so much to say something about the Vack-zeen, but our athletic director said the problem was a rare condition called “commotio cordis”, and he then explained exactly what this is.I of course wanted to call “bull” on that, and when I got home and looked it up I realized; this doesn’t pass the Occam’s Razor test. It’s an explanation only Rube Goldberg could love.Hundreds of thousands of homeless people in America, random murders of white people happening all over the place, a trip to the doctor costs $800, and all anybody wants to talk about is a football player who had a strange injury. It’s all bread and circuses now (without the bread).

            See, this is exactly what is so insane about this joke of a society.  I felt nothing for “Damar”.  Coudn’t give a rat’s a$$ if he croaked.  The black worship in this country makes me so sick that I can’t stand it much longer.  Meanwhile, the working people who froze to death were barely mentioned.  No one was offering counseling or condolences.  For some reason, this dindu is such a valuable life.  Uh-huh — as soon as his career ends, he will either end up dead or in jail (then out on bail) for doing what he instinctually knows how to do.  I don’t like blacks – at all.  I loathe them, actually, so I felt nothing for this guy.Whatever, at least while he’s in the hospital recovering he can’t commit any violent crime – well, who knows, he might find a way, but at least it is unlikely.

                I upvoted you but this guy is from everything I’ve seen he is a unicorn in the NFL. I don’t watch any sports so it’s all second hand. He’s from a two-parent household, has had jobs and is married with no kids out of wedlock. In the NFL he’s one of a kind.
That doesn’t mean anything at all but of all the guys in the league, he’s the last one I would want to criticize much.

        I said it often in the run up to the 2022 election, the entire thing is designed to humiliate us. Imagine dutifully doing your civic duty and supporting team red and going to the polls in November. Of course, you supported a side that you knew actively sabotaged itself during the election. It’s a side that you may even know actually hates you and wants you dead, preferably in the fields of the Ukraine. So anyway, that side gets its ass kicked in the election despite all polls saying otherwise, with the exact same mail-in shenanigans you saw in 2020 that were never challenged. Then you saw team red turn around in the lame duck period and vote to instill gay “marriage” into law, and pass a massive spending bill that would thwart the little power they did win.And now, with them seated, they are continuing to vote, over and over, to hand the power to the guy who was a central figure in all of this! Look, grillers gonna grill, but the dog and pony show that is “our democracy” has to have some veneer of legitimacy. How can anyone look at the situation since 2020 and say, “yep, voting harder will get us back on the right track”?

            Problem is they all have electorally safe districts, and an understanding that the uniparty will run only ultra-ridiculous candidates against them.  It is the only thing that can explain the Dims running Beta when Corn-hen was absolutely beatable. Had they run a Tulsi Gabbard even, Corn-hen would have been toast.  Which only goes to show that voting is meaningless at the national level for sure, state level probably, and local level maybe.

            Our side should vote for a left wing loon to be speaker. At least we would be clear on who our enemy is. Personally, in the next presidential election, we should all write in Stonewall Jackson. Fittingly, he was accidentally shot by his own side, a metaphor for our times. Making a mockery out of “our democracy” is the new game. Let’s learn how to play.
The idea that you can vote no matter how foolish, ignorant, or stupid you are is a great formula for the clown show we see now.

        I take the party’s steadfast open backing of McCarthy as yet another sign that the regime intends to escalate its war on the base/DR. With the opposition being publicly called terrorists and insurrectionists, what else can you infer? Like everything else they’ve been doing for the last 6 years or so, this swells our ranks, at the same time that they target us.

        I think you my not have given enough attention to Peterson, Z. Allow me, if I may:You are correct that Peterson is a Yesterday Man. I am thinking that Scott Adams is too. But – we are not the intended audience for those Yesterday Men. Their target demographic are the grillers, normies and geriatrics. When you consider that those guys watch TV and think they are informed… and that pedophile Hollywood celebs are bastions of truth and integrity…  the fact that they even give Adams or Peterson the time of day is amazing. It would be more correct to see them as “the Z Men” of their demographic. They represent a tectonic shift in Boomer politics. If these things keep up, the Dissidents are going to wind up with a sizeable and sympathetic demographic they’ve never had before.Those 20 men and women putting the boot up McCarthy’s arse are on the – what- 11th go…? You can bet Globohomo has put all their standard pressure on them – and FAILED. That is huge too. Don’t write them off so casually! So what if their actions are personal – most of ours would be too in that boat. I dunno about you, but some of them sound like real dissidents to me and for so far… they have walked the walk too.We’ve seen the sooty smoke of smouldering dissident politics for years now. Could these finally be sparks?

        “ The best part about this is the party has an easy way out of this jam. They could dump McCarthy and find someone that is not hated, but instead they are rallying around the establishment flag.”Not a chance.  It’s who they are and the curtain of deception has been drawn back.  This is a fight for the soul of the Rep party.  There is no compromise.  One side dies, one side thrives.  For the DR, there is no downside.  It is now apparent to all that the Rep’s are fighting for the status quo and their faux opposition to the Leftists.  A long as the neocons can make endless war on the national credit card, they will accede  to the Leftist destruction of the moral fiber of the country.  The Left for now considers this a “fair exchange”.

            When the Republicans attack the “Never Kevins,” they are saying to the leftists, “See?  We hate the conservatives too!  Please let us into your cool club.  Please like us!”
Conservatives are like the clueless guy getting blatantly rejected by the girl.  They just can’t take a hint.

        White people seem to have a spiritual and cultural crisis where young people lack basic skills, such as how to make money, how to find job/income opportunities, and just how to live in general. There are also tons of White people who went into useless degrees and work marginal jobs, living at home with their parents. I think the opioid/drug crisis has had a bad impact on the White labour force.There is definitely tons of money out there, but you need to avoid the traps of demoralization (anti white hatred reducing motivation to get a job), leftism (following your passion instead of getting a paycheque), and drug addiction. White guys who can do that are making money hand over fist.There’s really no reason for any White man to be homeless and on drugs when Wal-Mart is paying 90k for CDL drivers. The answer is clearly a spiritual and cultural crisis, where they are simply unable to think of any other path, and unable to maneuver themselves into a stable paycheque. Many seem stuck, dull, and frozen. Kind of like a deer in headlights.Two generations of low fertility rates are also starting to show especially as over a hundred million imports have been brought in. As we like to say, it’s not doctors and engineers swimming over the Rio Grande. Boomers are the last white, competent generation.

            “ There are also tons of White people who went into useless degrees and work marginal jobs, living at home with their parents. “Here, the leadership of the Rep’s are still trying to explain away the AZ stolen election, by trying to blame their gubernatorial candidate’s “loss” on her strident stand on the issues.  They bring up an interesting polling anomaly—the Lake campaign lost (40% to Dems 60%) the young “college educated” crowd to the Dem candidate.They of course attribute that to the strident stance of her campaign and the need not to nominate those extreme “Trumpists” in the future.  (Only “dumb” rednecks voted for Lake is inferred.)   Never is the simpler explanation that the colleges have successfully produced in great numbers, young, indoctrinated Leftists with faux degrees who unquestionably vote the Leftist ticket every time.

                That cohort is also 70% non-White.
It’s really not a surprise. They always try to explain it away as something else but it’s just that a Republican can’t win in a state that is 60% non-White.

                        True, but the point is that it is *fruitless* to expect to win the college vote as it is as fruitless to attempt win the other minorities votes.
The appeal to the college vote implicitly assumes a reasoning populace and hence the campaign message.  When in reality, that’s the wrong strategy.

            As far as whites avoiding demoraliazation, I’d advise young folks to get into small and mid-sized industrial automation businesses.
There is a serious lack of diversity. The atmosphere is polite and well-organized. There is little red tape and no struggle sessions. There are clusters of these businesses across the US.

Indiana has good demographics and is really good on the 2A for a state east of the Mississippi.Want to go West?Here is a similar place in Salt Lake City, UT:https://p-a-t.com/As far as education, his best choices in degrees are: Controls, Electromechanics, or Mechatronics Engineering. Mechanical or Electrical Engineering would work as long as they included coverage of electromechanics/mechatronics.If he’s still in HS and has the opportunity to get involved in FIRST Robotics or a similar activity he should do it.A lot of the work involved in the FIRST robots would carry over to his studies and career. It’s also a chance to get exposure to and establish contact with experienced, working engineers that volunteer for FIRST.

                        This is excellent. Thank you WGH. This is the kind of practical life skill advice and skill development that I’m thinking of for the “Dissident Parallel Economy Skill Sharing and Homesteading and Everything!” website I’d like to set up. I’m still trying to work out the details of how it would work. I’ll definitely make an announcement here (and on the blog I link to my posts even though I haven’t actually used it before). The two companies are actually somewhat in my field in fact. I bookmarked them both.

            I was in one of the GAE’s capital cities yesterday and was absolutely dismayed and crushed at how many homeless, drug-addicted young White men I saw on the sidewalks. These are young men who should be at the prime of their lives, in a supposedly prosperous country, yet they are pathetic wretches. The sad truth is that there is probably no hope for the majority of them, as they sink deeper into the morass, aided by government policies under the guise of libertarian legalization of drugs and “harm minimization.” This is absolutely intentional and undoubtedly the elites rub their hands with glee every time they see this. It all started with the CIA-engineered cultural revolutions of the 1960s and it is bearing fruit. To show how successful it is, I also saw an article today saying Oregon is now legalizing magic mushrooms. Our government has been waging a war on our people for generations and it continues.

                White men have been targeted by the U.S. government for sixty years now. Both the public and (allegedly) private sectors have been engaged in open discrimination against them and naked favoritism toward hiring women and blacks, no matter how incompetent, and illegals. All of this had been approved by the courts. The (((media))) disseminates 24-7 propaganda in which white men are portrayed as idiots and morons and criminals, while blacks and women are portrayed as intelligent and sophisticated and cultured and wealthy.If a white man is dumb enough to go out and get an actual job, he will be hectored and browbeaten with incessant HR “sensitivity training” for the most absurd bullshit, and will be summarily canned for some innocent remark that “offends” a tranny or a black while incompetent blacks and women with numerous infractions get promoted over him. If he can tolerate that, a minimum of one-third of his income will be confiscated by the government, not including sales and property taxes he must pay with whatever is left over.If he is arrested for anything, they will throw the book at him while women get a fraction of the sentence for the same crime and blacks are released on recognizance. He will have to empty his savings to hire a lawyer, while black defendants get public defenders. He will lose his job for an arrest no matter how bogus, even if the charges are dropped, even as it becomes illegal for his employer to ask black applicants if they have a felony record. If he was caught taking a selfie at the Capitol on 1/6, he will be hunted down ruthlessly and incarcerated, while blacks who torched and looted entire city blocks in the name of St. George of Fentanyl have the charges dropped.If he is stupid enough to get married to a woman, he will find that his wife has the total authority to murder his children in utero without his consent, OR put him on the hook for child support for 18 years plus college after she chooses to go fuck somebody else and takes half of his money, half of his home equity, half of his Social Security, half of his 401k and half of his future earnings. She will gain custody of his children after she files an order of protection against him and gets him summarily disarmed, and tells his children and his employer and the cops how “abusive” he is. All the while he is getting lectured about the “patriarchy” and “white privilege.”The only amazing thing is that there aren’t MORE homeless white men overdosing on drugs that we already have. The white man is the (ahem) “Negro” of the 21st century, the shoeshine boy expected to smile and pledge the flag and join the military and get his legs blown off for ZOG in some Middle Eastern shithole, while riding in the back of the bus as women and blacks and gays ride up front.

                    All I can add is the absurdity that blacks can use the n-word with impunity but if a white person sings along to a hip hop song that uses the n-word they are excoriated and cancelled.
This double standard is almost physically painful to me.  And everyone, present company excluded of course, accepts this without batting an eye.

                    A lot of the problems began with the slavish pandering to the needs of business that bedeviled the American Right for most of the 20th century and continues today. Even today, when I think of this stuff I’m reminded of one night like 20 years ago when I was channel surfing and happened on the bloated face of Newt Gingrich telling the viewers that “the median wage for labor is now set in Shanghai”.As a young man looking for work in the early 90s it was fairly obvious that employers would rather hire girls except where obvious smarts or physical strength were needed. Even there it was often obvious that they preferred women’s docile and obedient habits to men’s more mercurial tendencies. In practice this meant that many “foot in the door” jobs went to girls when they were clearly more needed by young men trying to start families.Statistics do show, of course, that young men tend to drink more and have more “attendance issues” than girls. Businesses weren’t necessarily being irrational then in preferring the girls. This was one of the many times when an actual Right that actually stood for tradition, family, and patriarchy, would have simply pimp-slapped the whiny capitalists and offered them a plane ticket to Leningrad (or Shanghai).It’s too bad we didn’t have more clever sci-fi writers then to sketch the outlines of the clownish gynocracy we have today. There was “Camp of the Saints” but I think that’s more about Europe cucking to the Muslims (admittedly haven’t read it). Could we have avoided the current disaster if there had been some “1984” type story outlining the dangers of Gynocracy? Perhaps not but I do know that Newt and his fellow travellers led the Boomercons far astray and the recent debacle over the speaker of the House shows that poisonous spirit is still the main force in our sorry excuse for a “Right” party.

            You can’t underestimate the effect of not getting any respect and that driving white males out of participating in society.  The authority, respect, and deference to a true leader commanded by Tinkles the Night Elf in World of Warcraft on the other hand keeps dragging me back to that game instead of dealing with all the assholes in the real world who are only talking to me because they think they can get money out of me.

            Peterson is just a grifter who ran out of gas.  He hitched his wagon to the manosphere, but had come in fairly late to the con.  The rise of fat women screeching at people giving college lectures allowed him to still have quite a bit of notoriety and success with Wash Your Penis, but frankly telling young guys how to pull their lives together at this point is a lost cause.The late Gen X/early Millennial crowd still grew up without electronic devices attached to themselves, so you could at least convince them to put on their finest purple pants and go out to the clubs to seduce women by insulting them.  Zoomers have their retarded tik tok videos and e-girls, they actually like eating processed food made out of cockroaches and think it’s cool, and all the plastic in the environment has given them testosterone levels of geriatric men.  Not only that, the women at that age all insist that they’re trans, so any dating advice is going to involve how to talk to the girl and compliment her on her imaginary scrotum.  No one wants to write that self-help book.

                Clubs are brutal these days.80% of the clientele is Indian/Arab men, many of whom don’t shower. Other clubs are mostly Africans. The other 20% is women who go in big groups for attention and Instagram photos. Drinks are $9 and cover is $20. Horrible scam and you aren’t going to get laid.The decline of clubs may actually be a good thing for us though. They’re pretty degenerate and I don’t think that spending endless hours looking to pick up women is a good thing for our people to be devoting their time and energy to. It distracts from family formation.

                    Yeah, I fell for all that stuff when I was in my 20s.  It never worked: you could get a few dates with one of these horrid women pretending to be an “alpha male”, but pretty soon my normal laid-back conflict-avoidant personality took over and they moved on.
At least I got into a gym habit from it all, so I’m thankful for that.

        Well, here’s a thought out of left field. The vigor with which these retards are advocating for McCarthy may have nothing to do with his potential as “Republican party leader” in the position as Speaker of the House, as he clearly is a Uniparty boy, judging from all indications. Rather, his importance is as the third in line for the position as President.If enough skeletons fall out of Biden’s closet, and the nascent national catastrophes fomented by his regime continue to ripen, he may need to resign, leaving Ol’ Cameltoe as successor, thus someone even less desirable to the Uniparty in line for the office. If McCarthy is installed, and Cameltoe’s resignation is arranged, he would be the successor. The Uniparty’s programs would remain in safe hands, as he is surely minded to continue them, and the allure for the left would be that all of the catastrophes already set to explode would come to fruition on his watch instead of that of “their” party.The potentials for mind-bending Kabuki are legion as the two wings of the Uniparty seek to blame each other for the forthcoming unshirted hell in a scene stolen from Dante’s Inferno. Just what one would expect from these evil weasels as they lurch from one disaster to the next.

            I try not to make predictions but honestly it wouldn’t surprise me if the McCarthy spectacle leads, more than any of the other recent disasters, to a big uptick in secession efforts. Watching “my party” go back and forth over and then ultimately and humiliatingly pick this evil toad as speaker just makes me want the whole sad spectacle of a country to be over with.

            Open Secrets estimates Rubio’s net worth is -$1.2 million as of 2018. He has lived in South Florida his entire life and only worked in politics as an adult, this seems almost impossible.  You would think some donor would have set him up with part ownership of a REIT that would pay good money to him.  You would think he would have at least half a million in home equity alone.  The 2020 disclosure puts him in the black at $400k, so maybe they are finally helping him out.During his failed Presidential campaign he talked about not wanting to run for reelection to the Senate because of how awful it was.  Then he dropped out and promptly ran again in 2016 and now again in 2022.  Whoever is backing him financially must have told him he isn’t getting offered a golden parachute in the event he elects to leave Washington before they are done with him.

Remember Hillary?  It was widely known and *never* denied how she in the early years turned a $1k cattle futures “investment” into $100k in a few months.  Her investment was little more than receiving a envelope filled with hundred dollar bills.

Zioclops crying about not being able to get anything done is boring and predictable.  His tough guy schtick has gone from effective to funny to just plain sad.  Luckily, the average person seems to be tuning out the drama, which shows an awareness that all of this is all theatrics.

            Heh, “Zioclops”. I’m definitely stealing that.
I referred to him as Eyepatch McCain the other day and was rewarded with a look one might receive if one had drowned the other person’s puppy. I can’t wait to see what Zioclops engenders.

            A friend of mine is the one who created the moniker “eyepatch McCain”.  He originated it on Twitter and it spread.  Zioclops is even better.
Someone should resurface that video of him being lambasted by some of his constituents and him saying “I don’t have any power”.  The man should do the country his greatest service by stringing himself up.

        First, most Republican representatives are RINOs, and many of these impostors are elected in “conservative” districts/states, so you eventually have to lay the blame at the feet of Normie and his ilk. Second, the defining feature of a RINO is extraordinary skill at lying, deception, and backstabbing. They are consummate Fifth Columnists and delight in fooling and abusing their constituents. Third, RINOs genuinely think of themselves as noble good guys doing God’s work on Earth but get massively offended when called out for their treachery and debauchery. And a RINO is a thousand times worse than a standard Democrat because they will stab you in the back every chance they get and do it will overweening pride of accomplishment. No society can long survive within backstabbers in its leadership. These vermin need to be called out for what they are.

            With utmost respect Tom, if 200 of them line up behind McCarthy, they aren’t RINOs. It means that the center of gravity of the party has moved way left.
So the dissidents are RINOs now. And that’s okay, because I agree with Zman that the destruction of the GOP is vital to our future.

            In the good old days in the South most voters would never consider a Republican because of Lincoln and reconstruction. They would as the saying went vote for a yellow dog over any Republican. The script has flipped now and the yellow dogs are dead, new voters sadly are yellow dog Republicans. If you’re an ambitious would-be politico in most of the South and a lot of the rest of the country you have a be a Republican.My state is a perfect example, the ambitious scum run as Republicans and immediately become rinos as soon as they’re elected. Inertia is too powerful to overcome when they have incumbency behiind them after that first election.The only solution to this I’m afraid is fear of us. I don’t see that at all happening. At some point the only solution is restricting the franchise to a very few.

                When I think of a conservative state that is a world champion at sending uniparty rinos to DC I think of Alabama. They are so good at it that it’s clearly not an accident. One would think that such a reliably “red” and “conservative” state would produce bulwarks of conservatism to send to DC, yet the last genuine and principled conservative they elected to the senate (Jeremiah Denton) was 40 years ago and they promptly voted him out in favor of a uniparty grifter who is only now retiring, to be replaced by a protege.There are probably some others that are just as bad about this as AL, but nobody does it better. Unfortunately it seems to speak to the incorrigible gullibility of Civnat G. Normiecon. Wave a flag and carry a rifle in your campaign commercial, and he’s all in.

            Our two Senators and Two reps in Red State Idaho are members in good standing of the uni-party.    The two reps are 1000% behind McCarthy.
Three of them are gigantic crooks.    Three of them are all in for Ukraine and one is not, at least he says he is not.  One of them is a medium sized crook.    There is no chance of ever getting rid of any of them until they decide not to run, in which case another uni-party WEF “conservative” is selected by the powers that be.   No sense voting for any of them.

                “…there are several factors in the die-off.”
Sure, but the point is that specifically it is not the disease of “Covid” that is directly responsible for the excess death rate.  It will become known in good time that it was any number of factors related directly or somewhat indirectly to the *government’s response* to the disease of Covid that caused the excess death rate we record now.
As I said two years ago, “we will find with this pandemic that the cure is worse than the disease…”

                    Agreed. I think the disruptions caused by the lock downs are a big piece of the puzzle. Lots of people stopped getting routine medical services as a result of the lockdowns. Lockdowns certainly did not help the steady rise in suicides. Of course, the fact that the virus itself was most certainly the result of government sponsored experimentation counts too.

                    Yes it is the jab.  These two latest studies showing elevated Troponin levels two days after vaccination in 100% of the vaxed is absolutely confirmation.Troponin I&amp;T are only found in heart tissue.  The only way it is found in detectable levels in the blood stream is when cardiac cells rupture.I was always puzzled that we had not seen Troponin studies when the first doubts on the vaccine surfaced.  Troponin studies were the easiest way to quickly confirm or dismiss the doubts.  That it has taken this long and that it is also getting no publicity means they know.

            We may be far from peak death rate on the clot shots.
In the before years, the average survival time for those with myocarditis is 5 years.  What we are seeing now could be the left end of the bell curve dying early, with peak death rate sometime in 2026-2027.

                I read somewhere that the medi-science arm of the government was trying to invent or roll out an additive in produce to be used as a universal clotshot so that everyone would be involuntarily vaccinated, and my first thought was turkeys because everyone even the homeless, eats turkey for Thanksgiving, it would be a once a year event, and they could gin up a turkey shortage so everyone would demand their right to have turkey at Thanksgiving.

                Bones:  Precisely.  Like others, I keep track of all the articles discussing increased death rates and miscarriages and brain clots and myocarditis.  But I don’t think there will be a sudden tsunami of death in 2023.  I think it will be a gradual acceleration over the next five years or so – and the increase will be primarily among White people, far more of whom are vaxxed than blacks, and who are dying off in greater numbers anyhow (age and/or drugs/despair) so it will be passed off as normal.  All the attention is focused on the sportsball or hollyood dolts dying, which I regard as an improvement in the gene pool.  But the increase in White death is what will have an enormous impact, and it will not be instant but rather cumulative.

                        There are Big Jevvs, and Little Jevvs, and it is seemingly no skin off the noses of the Big ones when the Little ones take it in the neck through the actuons of the Big ones. Consider the Big Jevvs declaration of war on Germany upon the ascension of Moustache Guy; predictable that the LittleJevvs might take the brunt. In Israel, I suspect that the consequences on the populations of Russian-origin or Orthodox from mandating the clot shots and boosters might have been seen as a win for Team Big Jevv. Cynical? Yes, but overly cynical, maybe not.

                The heart is a non-regenerative organ.  However, we may not see this as easily as in a 5 year blip in death rate.  A weak heart may simply show up in early death for heart attack and such.  Early being in the late 50’s and early 60’s.  This will tend to mask the phenomenon.

                    The place to look for jab-caused health issue is in immunity. I think what will learn over time is that the jab made victims more susceptible to other coronaviruses. This mean more severe cold and flu seasons, which will mean more deaths from the cold and flu.

                        That is why cancer is so common in the old, weakened immune system due to age.  It has been said, and I tend to believe such, that we get “cancer” all the time, but these abnormal cells are spotted and quickly eliminated.
Yep, look for a variety of cancers to increase for no particular reason.

So, what are the odds that the people with slight damage are going to live shorter lives as the damage takes it’s toll over time?

Bro.
Nostalgia for the win.
SRSLY.
1980s made-in-Amurrikkkuh textiles sell for hundreds of dollars [often $500 or moar] on eBay.
PRO-TIP: DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR OLD CLOTHES!!!!!
That ratty tattered mess which Jennifer Beals wore in Flashdance might just make it to the Smithsonian.

                I’m hardly a trump fan, but the one thing he was good at was getting his opposition to trip all over themselves in outrage. I don’t think he’s got a chance at being speaker, but if he did, he’d basically start putting nails in congress’s coffin, and that’s not nothing. Frankly, it’s more useful than anything the establishment would do.

                True.  But the cool thing about Trump is that he takes political rhetoric personally.  As Speaker, he’d end up in brawls with Democrats over petty slights instead of doing any real work – which would be ideal.

                It’s even funnier than that. I have a couple friends that recently retired from fedgov jobs. Now they are contracting for more than their previous salary because the gov can’t find skilled replacements. So, not only is the gov going to collapse upon their retirement, but it will blow up it’s financials trying to delay it.

                    Downside is, that now they are acting as consultants, they will likely continue to advocate for the same policies…or worse in some anti-virtuous downward spiral. That way they keep getting hired.
On the other hand, this leads to self-sustaining Accelerationism. You know, the worse the better.

                    And they are going to import half of Haiti, Venezuela, Somalia, Peru, Guatemala, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Syria and put them on welfare to solve the labor shortage.
Then in 20 years, they will work for the government and despise the remaining 30% of white Americans whose Social Security benefits will be collapsing. Better make plans now if you are going to be of retirement age in 15-30 years. Very important to live in a town/county that is of your people, you have multiple generations of family nearby and the town has an overall balance of old and young.

                        Aside from the “quality” of these new “Americans”, how can they be expected to work in this new post-Covid economic environment?There have been any number of studies looking at the current phenomenon of labor shortage given economic conditions. These studies are computing what one can “earn” by staying home and milking the current welfare system.If these studies are anywhere near correct, those on the lower economic rungs make more staying home than they do working at entry level, non-skilled jobs. Now if that’s true, and folk stay home, how do they ever improve themselves and climb the SES ladder?They won’t.  All they are is a repository of Democrat votes and therefore political power.  Worse, we’ll over educate their children and give them faux degrees—thereby producing an over abundance of future “elites”, who will demand even more economic concessions as befits their “status”.

                        Good for them.
Except, at best, those imports will only partially address the unskilled labor shortage.
What the idiots running the GAE into the ground fail to understand is that they are completely failing to solve the skilled labor shortage.
That’s the one that needs to be addressed to fight a multi-front industrial war, or even just to keep domestic infrastructure running smoothly.
I know this because I’ve just had my fifth recruiter contact of the day and it’s not even 1:30 PM.
