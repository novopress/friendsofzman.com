        Gobsmacker, if you wish to claim that a statement I made is wrong on “every imaginable level”, do try not to prove me right in your objection.
And Romas? They are not persecuted for things they do not do, but for things they will not stop doing. And for that they are not persecuted nearly enough. Their achievement in successfully resisting Western assimilation over one thousand years might be admirable if only the lifestyle was not also almost entirely criminal.

        Evolution.  You’ve got me asking am I a)stupid b) have an agenda c) challenging your aptitude.  Howbout d) just not sold on it?For me, a belief in God assumes that He (yes He, progenitors are addressed that way) can do what He wants any way that He wants and is not limited by our perceptions of what is possible.  He may have said “Let there be light” and left it to us to figure out how He did that, and we seem to be closing in it lately.  Same with Mankind’s origins (not the redundant Humankind).I have heard two stories, one Biblical, one not, both saying that we came from the dirt.  It is interesting that belief in God seems to allow one to keep his belief options open regarding man’s origins but to an unbeliever, the story we heard in biology class has to be true just the way it’s told.  No matter what, it’s just gotta be true.For me, it might be true, but if it is even possible (to me) that there could be another story, then your story of our origins, wonderful as it is, is just as fragmented a story as the Genesis account might be.  Hence your seeming frustration with dolts like myself.-I don’t believe there has been enough time generationally for the sophistication we see in complex organisms-I don’t believe that mutation and natural selection account for much of the story of evolutionary changes-I do believe jumping genes are cool-I do believe that at the microscopiclevel one-celled organisms are damned complex, and this complexity is not well understood and hence not well explained to Bubba-I do believe that bonobos have the intelligence of a german shepherd and precious little explains the vast gulf btw human intel and other creatures-I do believe that people (usually when young) who have no particular belief in God are easily convinced of the claims of evolutionary explainers; that being convinced first and finding answers to one’s questions later is the usual pattern for most evolutionary true believers.-I do believe that people “on the side of science” fail to understand that often there is an intelligence at work in those who are more cautious in their acceptance of evolutionary dogma.What would bring me closer to acceptance of all this is if someone strings together some aminos one day that can eat and reproduce and I’ll say that yes, indeed, the theory is sound.Funny, but that would only be proof that such a thing required an intelligence to bring it about.

        Most Jews in the Middle Ages were artisans. They were banned from numerous professions, so some went into finance. A lot of Italians went into finance, too.
But the issue is “middle-man minorities.” They found themselves working in middlemen professions, and as a minority, people gang up on them. The same thing happened to the Indians in Uganda, and in numerous other places.
The other issue is that Jews are smart, sober and productive, and nobody likes smart people.

        james wilson:  “Jews, especially the ones you are describing, have no great affection for the country”Sorry, but this is utterly wrong on every imaginable level.Zman: “…It is more likely the result of being a distinct minority that has often needed an exit strategy…America may have been a special place long ago, but today it is just a slab of land with a bunch of people living in it.”Precisely. Historically, the Jews, like the Roma, have been persecuted wherever they have lived. They are always looking over their shoulders for the next pogrom. They have a suitcase packed–both literally and intellectually–in case they are forced to flee suddenly. For 200 years America seemed to be the ultimate safe haven, but not any more.  These days America’s experiment in democracy is in great peril.

        Re: Fred ReedI too am uncomfortable with him and have been for years yet I do read him. He sure has had bad luck with his health which may explain a lot. Another point is he apparently had a very smart father and it is a hard act to follow if one is smart but not as smart as one’s father.Re: “creationism”Creationism is, I suppose, an insulting term such as using Capitalism as the term for the Free Market. Of course I was “educated” to believe tha evolution was correct but, even though I am not a follower of a religion, I have reservations about the theory of evolution. So that I don’t have to bother with the topic any more I have punted.Given that the time scale for evolution to work approaches infinity ( see Wistar conference circa 1966 ) there are two possibilities:1) Evolution is nonsense if the Big Bang theory is correct because the Universe is finite and young.2) Evolution is likely correct if the Steady State theory is correct because then time approaches infinity allowing the near infinite time scale needed for evolution to work.Now the problem is out of the hands of the biologists, mathematicians, and philosophers and into the discipline of Astronomy (Physics)–and one knows how that discipline is likely to come to certain conclusion. Ha, ha.Dan Kurt

        People who use the 2nd law argument against evolution don’t understand the the second law.  I can build for example, a house, and in doing so, I am increasing the overall entropy of the universe (I am expending a lot of energy to build the house).  I then have to invest more energy in maintaining the house.  Eventually, there is going to be an earthquake, fire, tornado, etc, which is going to do a pretty good job of randomizing the house.  Entropy wins in the end.Likewise with life.  “Life” (a bit of a cheat to anthropomorphize it, I know) is going to get randomized sometime.  The sun will go nova, or the earth will stop venting water vapor, or something else will make all life on earth unsustainable.What is amazing about life on Earth (and I am not the first to point this out) is that it has discovered (anthropomorphizing again) some pretty good hacks that have allowed it to work around entropy for over 3B years. One could make the same argument for a diamond, but life has cheated entropy in a spectacularly dynamic way that has produced coral reefs, dinosaurs, and Corvettes.Whether you want to believe that those hacks are due to the God of Life or the God of Chance is entirely up to you.
