        On Topic: Running around on a racetrack in a dark suit at night is dangerous – see “Play stupid games, Win stupid prizes”
Off Topic: “Don’t fight the cops.”
Bullshit.
Fight the cops all you want, just don’t expect(or plan to participate in) a fair fight.
Just shoot the bastards from cover.

        I’d sooner cross a sprint car track on foot than step out of my car in a bad neighborhood. Who are they kidding?

        The dead driver acted like no one had ever turned around another car in a race. Actually, it happens every few laps. Instead of getting angry, he should have been proud to have been spun out by Tony Stewart, instead of a nobody. Would have been a great story to tell his grand kids someday.
Seriously, if someone ran into you on the freeway, would you stand out in the middle of speeding traffic to “discuss” things?

        An ex-racer and fan did a nice post on what Stewart could see and not see from his vantage point in the car.http://comonocreerendios-lem.blogspot.com/2014/08/tony-stewart-and-kevin-ward-continued.htmlBottom line, the media, as usual, are trying to create a controversy out of an unfortunate accident. Much the same can also be said for media involvement in the St. Louis County shooting.

            From the stands where the video was shot, you have enough contrast to pick up the driver. From the driver’s seat, I suspect Ward was invisible against the dark background. That and there’s no reason to think someone is stupid enough to walk on the track.
The only person who knows what happened is Stewart and that’s because the other guy decided to walk onto the track.
