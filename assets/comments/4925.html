        Police Chief Wright’s comment, “Certainly the owner could preclude this merchandise.”, was chilling to me.  Absolutely chilling that a sworn police officer, who wears a gun, would say such a thing publicly.  That is one step away from action.  Bastard.

        re: the confederate flag, know you’re not a big fan of Denninger, but he makes a good point (as you do) that our culture is isis already, when it comes to destroying items/traditions of our cultural heritage.

        The cops had to ask about the law because, simply, there are far too many laws for any one person to comprehend. You would think this includes the police, but thanks to overproductive legislators still searching for the perfect law to control everyone,we now have too many ‘could be, might not be’ areas of doubt which means the average cop on the beat is going to struggle at times.Add to this the way cops can and do make up certain laws if they think they can (the police stopping people taking photos in a public place because they are sure it contravenes some law, for example) and the ultimate fear that someone, somewhere will shout loudly and point a keyboard finger at them.You can even throw in the fact that no one these days dare say “so what?” As everything is an issue then it is better think it is all important even when it isn’t.
