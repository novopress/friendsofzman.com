        I tend to agree with you that the “conservative GOP’ isn’t really and are indeed progressive in outlook and desired outcome.  I think that this is due to the c-GOP riding along “in the cradle” and getting great benefits without working for them.IMHO, this will lead to isolationism and a resumption of WWIII.Thankfully, I probably won’t experience it.  Unfortunately, my children and grandchildren will.Welcome back to 1933….
