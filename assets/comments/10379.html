        That you work full time and do four or five thought-provoking essays a week is amazing to me. What I admire and respect more however is that you exchange ideas with your commenters. There is a lot of brilliant and sometimes wild stuff going on in those threads. That is where the real learning and growing is.

        Congrats on all your success.  I don‚Äôt comment that frequently (work issues mostly), but I for one come for the articles and stay for the comments.  You‚Äôve got one of the best , and most actually *diverse*, groups around.  Good show.

        I just enjoy the banter.  It reminds me a lot of high school and my early 20‚Äôs.  It also reminds me of Rantburg before the powerskirts showed up and demanded that we all stop cursing.
The Middle Eastern problem goes back to when the Akkadians and the Chaldeans first started displacing the Sumerians.  Little defensible terrain, limited fertile land, and important trade routes mean chaos.  Read Josephus, the Anabasis, the history of the Crusades,‚Ä¶ hell, read any history of the region.  It‚Äôs a broken record.

        I‚Äôve come to enjoy your almost daily insights ‚Äì keep it up.Libertarianism:Reagan was running for President when I was a Freshman in H.S.  He was the first guy I saw who would speak honestly about big government, taxes, and the evil of communism.  So I researched him and learn that he came from the ‚ÄúGoldwater‚Äù side of the Republican Party.  So I researched Barry Goldwater ‚Äì and found my political home.Seen, read, and learned a lot since then but nothing has moved me very far from that brand of libertarianish conservatism.  Can‚Äôt get past the illogical stupidity of purists like Gillespie and his nonsense on open-borders.  But I‚Äôve always believed our Federal Government is orders of magnitude too big ‚Äì particularly on the civilian side.

        &gt;refresh of the site is still on the drawing board
I just hope it wont be a javascript heavy monstrosity, or even worse, optimized for mobile, pure horror!
Maybe just go back to your 2014 design?It used the ‚Äúveryplaintxt theme by Scott‚Äù

The ‚ÄúRead more ¬ª‚Äù in the comments is also still bothersome‚Ä¶
&gt;I have no opinions on Israel or Arab-Israeli drama.
What about the undue influence of Jewish power in the US?
They seem to be the tip of the spear of everything you are noticing.

        ZMan, I read you on the ferry home from San Francisco.  I imagine you speaking the words on a radio broadcast/podcast, aided by a tumbler of scotch. Many sharp comments, too.  Makes the commute enjoyable.  If you create a donation mechanism, as I think you should, I‚Äôll kick in.

        regarding your site re-design.  if you really wanted to have fun (and i think that you do) you could have a kind of simulation of the roman senate (or the scene on your home page header), with each member here assigned a ‚Äúseat‚Äù, with cgi rendering of a human form.  then replay the comments like a debate, with text to speech s/w.
also, you could have live debates with people speakjing through their avatars in the senate chamber.

        The ancient part of our brain function is reactive and quick, and it kept our ancestors alive in a world of routine existential threat and extreme hardship. We now live in a much different world and the modern part of our brain function is analytical and slower (and it enables longer term prediction and the avoidance of future danger). Consequently, when danger is imminent, we react. And alternately, when we repose in relative safety, we think.Today we are predominantly engaged in the latter activity, but we sorely miss the fitness selection mechanism of the former. In other words, we need an environment where robustness is favored by selection, not diminished.

        All large scale human institutions are bureaucracies and all bureaucracy is inherently dysfunctional. The root of this dysfunction appears to be human nature. The larger the human institution, the more bureaucratic it is.I have seen this principle in operation my entire life. NASA has failed to develop the technology to enable large-scale space colonization. The Tokamak (ITER) fusion program has failed to commercialize fusion. All of the medical research by NIH and what not has failed to develop effective cures for cancer and aging. These government-funded programs have failed, despite (or perhaps, inspite) the billions poured into them because they are all bureaucratic. Something like 90% of all medical research is bogus.Only private efforts to do these things can work, as we are seeing with Space-X, the various privately-funded fusion concepts (Tri-Alpha, General Fusion, etc.), and the SENS Foundation, which is making headway in its efforts to cure aging. Having been involved in some of these, as well as my own professional life, I have seen this principle time and time again. Bureaucracy does not and cannot work. Only targeted private efforts to accomplish anything can work.Since all non-libertarian world-views are based on the efficacy of large scale social institutions, they are, by definition, based on the belief of efficacy of bureaucracy. Thus they have no possibility of working and no possibility of being ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù.It is based on my personal experiences as well as the above that I have BY DEFAULT become MORE of a libertarian today, in my 50‚Äôs, than I ever was when I was in my 20‚Äôs.Institutions and organizations exist exclusively for the accomplishment of specific goals. Different organizations for different goals. the organization you create for the purpose of developing the bio-engineering to cure aging will necessarily be different than one you create to develop fusion power, or to develop low-cost access to space. The organization that is created exists to achieve the goal it was created for, nothing more. I am not interested, and have no use for any human organization and institution that is not focused on the goals I want to achieve. They are utterly worthless to my future self. Thus they, and the philosophies that underpin them are meaningless to me.

            every institution has a lifecylce, and this is well understood.  what you are describing is the terminal phase, akin to an organism that has grown old and bloated.  the early phases can be very productive, and even the middle phases see progress.
you might want to keep the manhattan project in mind, before repeating your opinion to others.

                The Manhattan Project was a special case that proves the rule. It is the ONLY counterexample to my point. I stand by my point. I reinforce my point by citing the human genome project. The government version of this was expected to cost 3 billion dollars and take 30 years. It was done privately in less than 10 years for 10% the cost.I actually agree with you guys (and have said so many times on Vox Day‚Äôs blog) on substantive issues like immigration, HBD, Islam, and the liberal-left (I am one libertarian who, nevertheless, thinks that immigration should be stopped again for another 40 years). Trust me when I say I‚Äôm right there with you guys on these issues.However, you guys really go off the deep end with your obsession with archaic ‚Äúfeudal‚Äù notions like denying women the franchise, somehow coercing people into having kids who don‚Äôt want them (what a bone headed idea), or even preventing people from moving to different parts of the country (or living overseas if they choose), or going into certain professions even if when they have the cognitive ability to do so. You guys ought to know as well as I do that these kind of restrictions on personal and professional life choices will never fly. I honestly do not understand why you guys obsess over such non-sense. Maybe you guys play too many computer games that take place in a medieval setting.This also makes clear you utterly fail to understand why so many of us voted for Trump and will consider any successful effort to remove him from office for any reason whatsoever to be an illegitimate coup.In short, we are sick of the authoritarianism of the liberal-left, in how we run our business and make our money as well as personal life activities. In what we can think. In what our kids are taught in school, etc. What on Earth makes you guys think that we are about to accept any kind of authoritarianism from the right? Intelligent, competent self-starter types (in the Heinlein sense) have absolutely no use for any concept of authoritarianism in the sense that is bandied about in alt-right /traditionalist blogs. You have to be dreaming (or hallucinating) to think that there will ever be any kind of authoritarianism from the right that will last more than about 2 seconds.

                aging isn‚Äôt a disease, it is a feature; i.e. intentionally in the dna.   so ‚Äúcure‚Äù might not be technically correct.  however, it is very feasible that the mechanism that causes aging can be turned ‚Äúoff‚Äù, and perhaps even rewound a good deal.  at that point, a lifespan in hundred‚Äôs of years may be reachable.   perhaps teapartydoc can add some insight here‚Ä¶

                    It depends on your definition of disease. If your definition of disease is limited to that caused by infectious agents, then no, aging is not a disease. However, if you define any condition that causes a reduction in the functionality of one‚Äôs physiology, then of course aging iis a disease.

        I don‚Äôt usually comment here.  Too ‚Äúsnappy‚Äù compared to other sites.  Folks don‚Äôt recognize names so they‚Äôre instantly on the defensive if you use logic instead of automatically agreeing with them.  I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs similar to lib sites except that you don‚Äôt get insta-banned if you disagree with the average commentor.

            I‚Äôve only ever banned three people, I think. In all three cases, it was a lunatic filling up the comments with nonsense. Otherwise, people are free to work out their differences on their own.
What I find somewhat amusing is that I have regular readers who are hard core Zionists and regular readers who are hard core white nationalists. I have trad conservatives, libertarians and liberals. I don‚Äôt know what that says about me, probably nothing. I think it is just the result of the ongoing ideological and cultural realignments.

        I love the blog but have made it a practice to really rarely read the comments.  I‚Äôm posting this without having read the other 69 comments.  I will try to explain why this is the case in hopes of improving the blog.It might be the computer I use to follow these (a Macbook with OSX Yosemite), but most of the comments are cut off and you have to click ‚Äúread more‚Äù at the end of the first paragraph to get the whole thing.  I suspect this is the blogger software.  Usually half the comments you have to do this to get the whole thing.  My reading style is to scan the entire comment, and then if I think it is worth my time, go back and read more slowly to get the argument.  I can‚Äôt do this having to click on ‚Äúread more‚Äù the whole time.  So I just skip all of them.Would it be possible to change the settings so that more than one paragraph appears before you have to click ‚Äúread more‚Äù to read most of the comment?

            That‚Äôs why my eyes glaze over whenever this comes up. Arabs will look at that and reject everything including the choice of editing and lighting. Israelis will claim it closes whatever case they think it makes. Rinse. Repeat. The endless conflict is what has come to define the people of the Levant. Therefore, there can be no end to the conflict. It is an unsolvable puzzle.

                    Legal case?
Does this mean if Israel loses a lawsuit somewhere it can be abolished by court order somehow?
Uhm, I think not. Your whole a idea about a legal case for a nation-state is just silly.

                Read a good bio of Kemal Ataturk several years ago‚Äìmore out of curiosity after 9/11 on how the Turks built a secular state (and kept it until recently).  Funny thing in the chapters covering his life as young Army officer in the years leading up to WWI, most of the Turks‚Äô effort it the Levant was spent trying (with limited manpower) to peel the exact same groups off each other that are fighting today.  Some things never change.
Thoroughly enjoy going hooky in the office and visiting here.

                    That is so true. When I was a school boy, we were assigned a task of writing a paper for history class just using the newspaper archives. It was fun reading the old help wanted ads.‚ÄùWanted: Two Irish for painting.‚Äù I stumbled upon a story about the Levant from 1948. I was amazed that is was just like the stories I was seeing in the current papers. That was the end of my interest in the topic.
