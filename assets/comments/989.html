        I certainly didn’t intend to take you to task. I compare spelling errors to a bit of spinach stuck between one’s teeth. It can become too much of a focal point and take away from the bigger picture. Some people care about the spinach, some don’t. As for your grammar, I see no problem. In fact, I appreciate flexibility if it is effective.
