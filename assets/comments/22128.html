        If the coup succeeds, many Americans will rationally conclude that we have passed a tipping point in our nation’s history. Once election theft at the presidential level is legitimized, the rule of law is dead and we no longer have a bond as citizenry. This is no trivial thing, so what to do about it? In a nutshell, prepare now to confront and oppose the inevitable tyranny. Do this with seriousness and intelligence. It is existential. Your actual life depends upon your tangible actions going forward. Natural evolution is being restarted like an oncoming freight train.

            In a nutshell, prepare now to confront and oppose the inevitable tyrannyMental preparedness begins with accepting this simple instruction.For those just waking up, start small and start now.Look around at the elements of the Machine that have enslaved you (debt, “job security”, academic pursuit financed by debt, mortgage dependent on the Greater Fool, prog family, etc) and respond right now. TODAY.Food, water, &amp; physical security…start there. Take stock of your position. Make corrections, fortify and begin jettisoning your dead weight. Anyone defending any idea that voting harder, or getting our guy into _________ cannot be convinced. They will anchor you to the ground when the horde arrives.Being able to project force can come after you’ve put your house in order. But you have very, very little time left.

                “If the coup succeeds…”I like the direction of threads like these two as they are where I have always focused, proactive, scanning the horizon.To be frank, this “if” does not mention the stellar “Platinum Plan”, letting felons out to roam our streets, let alone ‘our guy’ pitching us to ‘take the jab’. I could go on, but my point is made, you should already be deep into planning how to deal with the potential dystopian fallout of what has been taking place for years. It will surely accelerate following the election theft, but it is already well underway.As a person that lives simply, and consumer debt free, I see the main exposures to the small fort I have worked hard to build, including debt free children that have zero consumer and student loan scam debt, and thus are also debt free:— serious devaluation of currency— government cuts us off from our own funds, see Cyprus, etc.— government levy of a percentage of savings/assets— forced vaccinationWhatever your take on Robert Kennedy, Jr., here is HIS take is to avoid the vaccine at all costs.Even if you have a job/trade that has not been destroyed already via government “Covid” fiat, diluting the value of your savings can put you out on the street just as governors are illicitly bankrupting their craven choice of small business people now.Cutting us off from our own funds could be couched as ‘against the rich’ but then affect, perhaps, “non essential” persons and firms, or just further downstream, again based on illicit government fiat.Same goes for a levy, ‘sold’ by the usual ‘against the rich’ lie, but aimed at the middle class, the true holders of wealth the grasping class are after.

                    Yep, but that’s fine—if you don’t take it too seriously.  One can do more than one thing at a time.  Hope, but prepare.  If hope (as in the TX law suit) immobilizes you, then abandon it.

                    No. Never give up on your People. Just because you arrived here now doesn’t mean everyone who hasn’t is unsalvageable. Impatience is a problem in Our movement. Proselytize. Lead. Cajole if necessary. The Leftists will give you more converts every year due to their hubris. Ours is a mission of holy weight, treat it as such and not as a flash in the pan.

                    Georgia doesn’t have that authority; the courts do. That said, I’m not by any means confident the courts will uphold the law and what remains of the tattered Constitution. It seems to me most of the courts are part of the Power Structure.

            In a nutshell, prepare now to confront and oppose the inevitable tyranny.


The tyranny is on its way regardless of the success of the coup. We’d have pretty much known the next steps at the end of January but Davos has been pushed back to summer. Meanwhile, the broad outlines of the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset are onlinehttps://www.weforum.org/great-resetIn further bad news we haven’t seen the last of the Swedish Autist formerly known as Greta.

            “…represents not only a narrow cultural slice of American society, but a narrow economic slice as well. Since the end of the Cold War this has become acute.”One glaring difference among the elites from prior years is the almost maniacal destruction of the very institutions which they had formally used for control purposes. Most Americans have become disdainful of academia, the news media, corporations, entertainment, etc. The elites’ hamfisted messaging and subjugation of all the tools they used to use because Orange Man had to be destroyed has rendered them ever more useless as tools of control.Yes, due to current lack of options and, as-of-yet, a still relatively solid dollar… people are still partaking of the things I mention above. However, the numbers are diminishing and more people than ever are checking out and openly mocking these institutions.Prior generations of elites would use these things, and because they were respected institutions, could wrap them and themselves in the flag and sell it to Americans as patriotic. The only thing they can try selling an increasingly beleaguered American public “Immigration Good!” and literally wrapping a star spangled hijab on a brown woman on the MTS buses in adverts.Their open attack on every aspect of trad Americanism and the dumpster fires they’ve made of the institutions really is beginning to hamper them. These are things we can work with.

        Today, it is the broader middle-class that is becoming increasingly radicalized by the intransigence of the ruling class.Yes, it’s funny in a way. I hear many people lament the demise of the middle classes – as both an social and economic entity – yet from where I sit almost all our problems are caused by this sort of person.I have yet to be lectured by a scaffolder, bricklayer, mechanic or whatever you fancy on ‘the need to enforce strict tax measures to save our planet’ or ‘to wear the mask as it saves lives’. These people also have very little direct experience of life outside of their bubble. An example was a video a left-leaning colleague showed me the other day. The video was off police attempting to disburse a group of teenage girls who were having a party during lockdown. The girls, bless their hearts, kicked up quite the fuss and one slammed a lamp on a male officer. My colleague ‘couldn’t believe such violence existed’… the violence was a best tepid and I left the room, as usual, not surprised.

                Depends.  Chimney guy was at my home few months back.  Even on the ladder he wore a mask.  I couldn’t resist, and it turns out he was a retired union worker from up north, and was voting for the pretender because the pretender”s experience in government would get it functioning properly again.

I tell them to do what they feel is right for them, but “we are not mask people”—regardless of our age.  Repeatedly, we have run into this both at home and outside.  A simple ignoring of the herd or a word to the salesperson yields a mask removal quicker than you can blink.

        The tipping point may very well come when businesses and perhaps even local governments begin enforcing “mandatory” C19 vaccine laws. You will need a vaccine card to enter a supermarket, a doctor’s office, or to even drive your own car (vehicle checkpoints on your local streets?).  With the C19 lockdowns the ruling class now has the blueprint for nationwide pacification. I’m afraid we ain’t seen nuthin’ yet.

            This is the flashpoint we need to focus on. By refusing to cooperate, we can use Covid as the raison d’etre for launching a counter-revolution. The ruling class have handed us a weapon we can use against them.

Their excuse is, the vax doesn’t cure and leaves you an “asymptiomatic”, that ridiculous new medical standard.

Well with the circumstances you describe it begs the question how many LEOs will remove their badge and weapon and place them on their supervisors desk and how many will gleefully jump at the chance to arrest an 85 year old granny and smash her face into the sidewalk enforcing “executive orders”?

                It will be mostly neither depending on where you live. Police see the hollowed out economy the same as everyone else.  Only those with other employment options will pop smoke based on their morality,  because they want to care for their family same as many others.  Many of the rest will do what they do now, and turn a blind eye and let slide stuff that their common sense knows isn’t worth enforcing.But what should be concerning is that new group, those who don’t share bonds with the community or drunk on the power of imposing their own restorative justice, that will be slamming grandmothers.As always, make friends in the community and build your resiliency and that of your community.

                    A lot of cops that have a conscience, are resigning their posts and moving to more congenial places.  The same self-sorting that is going on with the rest of us.  The blue areas will have blue meanie cops, while the red places will generally have LEOs that are what one would want to have in the post.

                If only never leaving home and having all essentials delivered by drone were the end game. Or the complete breakdown of real community or the psychological toll inflicted by isolation. These things are just to soften us up. If the end game resembles what was in store for the losing side in this demented game (Russia, Germany, the Confederacy), perpetual face diapering will seem like a walk in the park. Losing is not an option.

                Problem with vaccine mandates is that these have already been supported by the courts.  We here went through this with the standard flu vaccines a decade of more ago.  At that time the courts rules hospitals and schools and such could require vaccine as a condition of employment.
As far as students go, there still is suspension for religious concerns, but I suspect that will go away shortly. It is a short step from requiring masks for the healthy to vaccination.

The longer the pandemic drags on due to the lack of courage of anti-vaxxers, the more time for elites to carry out the various bad ideas they are entertaining under the justification ofThe Great Reset.

        Steve Sailer saying he sees no evidence of fraud really astounds me. Civic nationalism or undying belief in institutions doesn’t explain it well for me. One of us is not right in the head and I don’t think it’s me.

            I listened to that interview and when Sailer said that, it was astonishing.  And Dutton agreed with him, although I get the feeling he hasn’t followed the election fraud that closely.  When it comes to numbers and statistical probabilities, etc, I normally would put Dutton and Sailer right at the top of the list.  It’s also surprising that on yesterday’s TDS show, Mike Enoch also said he didn’t think there was enough election fraud to swing the results.  But maybe that’s Trump dislike talking.

                    A funny thing with the paleos is they could never return the favor. They were ejected with prejudice from polite society, but always longed to be rehabilitated. I’ve never understood it, but I suspect it is due to never having been in polite society. It’s hard to lament the loss of something you never had. It’s why I have a soft spot for them. It is probably very hard to feel rejected by your peers or people you see as your peers.

            Sailer’s reluctance over the past five years or so to move forward has been interesting and saddening. He seems stuck in a time warp at about the year 2000, constantly trying to convince David Brooks-types that it’s in their interest to lay off Whites.I realize that Sailer always hoped to be part of the accepted pundit crowd around the level of Murray and Coulter, but he had to have realized years ago that this wasn’t going to happen. In addition, he’s definitely noticed that even crew is being replaced by more militant and younger writers so there’s not much left to join anyway.I suppose for some it’s just hard to accept that the world that they grew up in is dying.

                    Sailer doesn’t want to notice these changes. He doesn’t want White communities slowly breaking apart. He still hopes that the logic of Citizenism will win over the ((TPTB)) out of self-interest.
It’s too late for that, Steve.

                “I suppose for some it’s just hard to accept that the world that they grew up in is dying.”Yes, it most certainly is. I’m about Sailer’s age, and, yeah, it’s hard, no exaggeration, it’s like watching a close family member die – they may not have been perfect, but they were yours, and its so hard to leave it behind. But it has to be done.Sailer is a lot like Jared Taylor – he’s brave and honest, and still does some very good work, and our side probably wouldn’t exist without him, but there’s a certain point beyond which he will not go. All you can do is note that, shake your head, and move on. I loved my country more than I can put into words – but gone is gone.

                    I can see that. Sailer has done our side a tremendous service and stayed independent when I’m sure that it cost him a lot – which is why I still send him money every month.
But his unwillingness to acknowledge the current reality and what’s best for his people is odd. It has to be a flashing billboard in his face every day, and, yet, he (quietly) ignores it. He has to know where this all ends.

            A lot of people seem to assume you need a Snidely Whiplash character twirling his mustache while explaining to a camera how they are going to commit fraud.In truth, we all know that left to their own devices, people will do whatever cheating they need to win.  The null hypothesis for any election should therefore be “The election was fraudulent unless very compelling evidence states otherwise.”Can anyone say with the issues with machines with proprietary code, massive issues with chain of command, vote counting going on for WEEKS, unobserved ballot counting, and non-existent signature matching that this is the case?

                A number of years ago, I was impounded on a Grand Jury for several months.  The initial part of the “impressment” was a couple weeks of training in AZ Revised Statutes.  Sort of “Law School Light”. One thing I remember was the DA lecturing on rules of evidence—especially circumstantial evidence.  Circumstantial evidence being *preferred*, all things being equal—people suck at what they remember and can testify directly to—but eye witnesses always impress a jury the most.  We were warned against this.I see that situation here.  Folks don’t believe that fraud was blatant in the last election because they want to see witnesses and hear stories (impossible) about the myriad and distributed efforts to rig the election for Biden.  Hence we get the silly retort, “not enough evidence to turn the election”, whereas the circumstantial evidence calling the whole of the election into dispute is ignored—when it is the more correct and inductive evidence in such matters.Z-man saw this a couple weeks ago an wrote eloquently on such.

                        Agree somewhat. I believe that’s the result of Sailer’s work, but I no longer believe it’s Sailer’s intent. I don’t think that he wants what’s on our side. It’s just that his noticing gets people to the riverbank regardless.
Sailer refuses to give up on Citizenism, which is just HBD Civic Nationalism. He doesn’t want separate White communities. But since Citizenism is a bankrupt idea, his readers sooner or later start to look elsewhere. Again, that’s the result, not the intent.

                Sailer is getting hammered in the comments section on the Charles Blow column he posted.  He hasn’t pushed back much when his readers have gone after him over Covid.

            I began reading Sailer many, many years ago (long before he joined Unz). He has never moved beyond his initial beliefs and style. He is tepid, which gets you an old man frightened of the flu and telling the young’ns to settle down and work with their fellow multikult ‘citizens’ to fix the eternal system. I side with God on the tepid.

                Rather they know how far he will push, and that ultimately he doesn’t really matter.  He won’t explicitly advocate for Whites so his ‘citizenism’ matters only to those who will follow him in an endless loop, and those respectable Conservative Inc. writers whose ranks he desperately wishes to join can and will safely ignore him.

        I agree. Fine essay, and not just because I agree with the fundamental premise, heh heh.Campaigned (while living in the USA) for both Perot and Buchanan, pleased to have done so, and then left the country for the final time. I hope Prez Trump prevails in this mess that proves the premise of this essay. Whether he does or not, however, the “system” is indeed broken, as is the idea of a united “proposition” for the nation. There are now two propositions and only one can prevail. The outcome will be of great import going forward, particularly if a third arises in its wake, as well it might. I for one, although now without a dog in the fight, given my self-imposed exile, favor areconquistaby the latter-day yeomen in the restoration of arepublicrather than a repressive “democracy” that will no longer satisfy anyone. The ideological divide is now too great to bridge given profound differences within the geographical and political divide.

            Precisely right. There is no point in attempting to reform a corrupt system. Both parties are simply branches of a poisoned tree. Without the ability to participate, we need to rid ourselves of a ruling class that now openly despises us. I know some of them personally and I can read the hatred and determination on their faces. They have to go.

                Okay, so China got pushback from Trump, and nuked us.  With bioweapon warheads.
The problem is, our Bunker Class collaborated.
Building the weapons lab, providing material samples, even training their scientists in our universities.  WTO, Red Chips, Fast Track- our elites have been building an outsider system for a long time.
That, to me, says “hatred and determination”.

                        I have a feeling you’re right but I think it’s more to do with the culture in general. Generally speaking most people will do whatever it takes to keep whatever they have, especially if it’s a well-paying job. It just so happens that cops have the job of enforcing the laws of the ruling elite.With non-LEO people, they will go along to get along no matter how pozzed things become. Don’t wanna risk losing the cushy job. Notice that anyone who goes to DC ends up drinking the kool-aid and support the swamp, regardless of what they may have professed prior to going there.

                                Occasionally, and in deep blue areas. But there’s not much chance little Brittnee is gonna whip out a hawgleg when the cop starts pushing her around. Invading people’s houses to steal their firearms will require a bit more gumption.

                        I’m sure how they act, and how they might act in the future, is dependent on the particular local LEO culture in which they dwell.  Worth checking out what that culture might be, where you live…

                            Writ large, what do you think the LEO culture has been in the US over the last 30-50 years?
Has it been a culture zealously protective of the right to keep and bear arms as manifested by a refusal to arrest those who have refused to submit to licensing and registration schemes?
Has it been a culture that has discouraged its chiefs from deciding whether to issue firearms licenses?
Has it been a culture that has steadfastly protected private property from the violence perpetrated by the burners, looters, and murderers?

                                There is not “a” LEO culture, there are a bunch of them, which are different in different places, and also evolve over time in any one place.  This is one of the things not talked about in the media.  But get out there, talk to them, observe how they operate, and do it in different places, with different LEOs, and you start getting a better sense of what is going on out there.  There are LEO communities just like any other, and these LEO communities are embedded in larger local communities, and often share the virtues and vices of the communities in which they live and operate.  How could they not?

                                    I have done so, and your position is incorrect.  I’ve talked to deputies, HP, and cops: most are transplants from the coasts and were trained by departments we all revile, where by policy those leos imposed the most extreme forms of oppression against our people.  There are no “local LEO’s” any more than there are local *.mils. There’s a blue line, and  heritage Americans are on the other side of said line. Dont forget it.

Flailing about haphazardly is generally counterproductive. You get all sorts as police, as in any profession.Nobody here is fanboy backing the blue. Most here express nuanced thought on how to deal with policing in Our struggle. We will have allies and we will have persecutors among their ranks. These two fools wish to assure that we have only the later and make no outreach to potential bridges within law enforcement. They’ve let personal emotion and upset drive their thoughts when we should be looking coolly at the problem and potential of this subject.Gentlemen. Grow up, particularly you Liberty Mike. You ramble around like a bull rutting, fedposting and insulting posters of long standing that are respected by thecommunityhere.

They won’t “come for the guns,” they will come for Red Flags, restraining orders, magazine, ammo, MSR/ar or whatever else prohibition violations, registration violations, involuntary welfare checks, etc etc.Put not your trust in the lies of man, of those whose livelihoods depend on evading the nature of reality.

            America has fallen into the same trap that the Romans and Spanish fell into. Specifically, the empire has provided the ruling elite with a source of funding that is exogenous to their society – and therefor outside the bounds of control that previously existed.For the Romans it was the conquest of wealthy regions and an influx of slaves. For the Spanish it was Latin American silver and gold. For the US it’s the petro dollar and endless “debt”.America is at a point where taxes don’t matter at all for funding the federal government. They’re utility is only in punishing disfavored groups and as a lever to control actions.

                The offshoring of our industry has largely supplanted the petrodollar. Like the petrodollar, offshoring our industry provides a sink for all the credit created to keep the empire running. Offshoring has the additional benefits of increasing the profits of corporations, hiding inflation by allowing cheap imports and offshoring is not limited by where geology decided to locate oil deposits.

                    Not sure I follow.  The petro-dollar is what creates a demand for dollars, allowing the US to print them at will.  How does offshoring create a demand for US dollars?

                        Offshoring is a consequence of the demand for dollars created by the petro dollar arraignment.
The general phenomenon is well understood in economics and goes by the nameDutch Disease.   But it’s never discussed wrt the US.

                        A world reserve currency requires a trade deficit according to the Triffin Paradox. It doesn’t matter what that deficit is due from – oil, Chinese junk, Korean chips even military spending.It turns out that offshoring provides far more benefits than petroleum which was what we had to work with in 1973.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triffin_dilemma#:~:text=This%20dilemma%20was%20identified%20in%20the%201960s%20by,exchange%20reserves%2C%20thus%20leading%20to%20a%20trade%20deficit.

                        You forgot the old, tired saw: Nukes.
The weapons we have are not different than those that have bogged down dozens of governments trying to maintain control of their “peasants”. Most all these governments have eventually failed.
The great unknown is if we are even half the men our fathers and grandfathers were. The true warrior has no favored weapon.

                            are you talking about the american revolutionary war, cause that wasn’t peasants vs lords type situation, that was country vs countries type situation,90 percent of all American troops carried French arms, and americans were completely dependent on French gunpowder, Spain and the dutch helped americans as well, also americans had home advantage which means a lot when you’re on the other side of the world. Point being americans had that war in their pockets.

                        But the British have so many cannons, men and Hessian mercenaries!Drop the learned helplessness, go look in your cabinets, look at your accountability list and  think. Don’t act mind you, think and toughen your mind,You’ll realize that if you are willing to give up comfort or even your life , you can take the future you want. You have a shit ton of power.In any case any hypothetical hopefully avoided  boogaloo  will not be fought by armies than can be mowed down by drones. Chemical weapons other than tear gas and the like will not be used as we don’t have many left and the results would be very very bad for the group who used them. This creates mass insurgencies and its 50/50 these days insurgencies win.Nor will the  lockdowns continue forever. There are already mass protests and no matter what our media does, people know.I mean big important people like Disney and Warner and others are falling into ruin and no bailout can fix that. They don’t want ruin, only to line their own pockets.Truth is if the economy isn’t up and running very soon, as in a month or maybe three  there will be mass homelessness across the nation do to evictions  and a total economic collapse which is fertile ground for a revolution.There is nothing in the way of handouts that can paper over this problem even assuming Biden/Harris is allowed to steal the election without a war.

                                Fertile grounds doesn’t mean “will certainly happen.”  or specify the time frame. It only means “becomes a lot more probable”Also its possible that regulations will slow the mass homelessness. California won’t have as many issue, our State will tell the banks “no evictions.” and issue bonds to buy them out.The State is already the largest lender and is happy to go down the Singapore road.Also doesn’t  mean  it will be your revolution or any of that other hoo-ha .As for factions, my guess is that if it happens it will be the Communist/Woke Left attacking the Corporate Left. We saw a ton of that this year already.Joggers are a wild card but there are groups radicalizing them now.Not effectively as of yet but subject to change, religious groups are the real threat more so than BLMNo idea about Latinos.As far as Good Whites, no idea either.There are many moving parts right now  new suits and tremendous instability.beyond “mass evictions make it more likely.” truth is its all  Magic 8 Ball hazy ask again later.

                            Regarding the war he was making a  factual point. For balance of power reasons the great powers of Europe needed the British to lose.Might want to look at the population figures for both sides of the war hint: the British had a much smaller population with or without the Hessians.

                                I was talking about mindset with that remark about the Hessian troops  not historyAlso  situations now and than are quite different.If/when  we go to guns its going to be Bosnia x Rwanda or something akin to a Latin American civil war or the like not a fairly genteel British on British war.Once the elite no longer care about their people, they have to be removed B.A.M.N.If there weren’t overt voter fraud by politicians who are effectively  Chicom agents I’d tell everyone to vote harder and work those memes.Problem is we did that, won more or less than had our votes nullified.If Trump does not win we are Chinese slaves unless our guys get hard and dangerous  and fast.Too much easy living as made us useless cattle for the elite and that needs to change.Now right now I am telling everyone to mentally toughen up, nothing more, Its what we need anyway far more than anoy of the other rich mans toys preppers buy.In the end the guy that wins this is the guy whose mindset is with his last dying breath drags himself over to the atmosphere burner and presses that button as he’d rather leave the earth a lifeless shell than give an inch to tyrants.To the last, I grapple with thee; From Hell’s heart, I stab at thee; For hate’s sake, I spit my last breath at thee. Sic semper tyrannis Motherfucker.Be that guy and have a future worth living or just be a Chicom /Globalist Consumer slaveAnd before whichever sperg tell us Trump won’t save us. I know that. Nothing can save the Republic.If he wins and if he fixes elections he buys us time and allows the high road option.That is enough.

                        The early legions  of Rome were filled with yeoman farmers.Most weapons in history were adapted farm tools so it’s quite an advatage to be a muscular agricultural laborer.Also they were hard people which counts for an awful lot in war.

                        While looking to the past for examples can be useful, every situation is new in most of its aspects. There has never in history been a situation like we are facing today, we’re on our own here. The good news is, so are they. It’s very important to realize this,because while trying to “learn the lessons of history” can be important, it also can be taken too far. We very largely got WWII because everybody was trying to avoid another WWI, we got Korea because we were trying to avoid another WWII, we got Vietnam because we were trying to learn the “lessons” of Korea, and trying to learn the lessons of all of the above led us into both Iraq wars, among other things. History isn’t a class, it”s just a bunch of stuff that happens, with some common threads running through it. That’s important to remember.

                        Well, seeing as how most Americans are neither elite soldiers nor agrarian workers, it would appear that both our historical comparisons aren’t really relevant to the situation at hand. That brings me to my original point: don’t cherry-pick historical anecdotes to make an argument.

                I think a large % of the population, especially the hated deplorables have suffered real physical, financial and psychological damage these past seven months.  And the mf-ers are piling on with the lockdowns again.  Debt, rent and mortgage forebearance are ending in the early new year.  Throw in the fraudulent election that no one knows how will play out – the setting is primed for substantial chaos.

        Your observation that Trump is a foreign body that they felt the need to flush out was spot-on, but the problem is that any organism that wants to achieve homeostasis needs to establish a feedback loop for regulation. But the ruling class that just ousted Trump is not just homicidal against white normies and Christendom. It is nihilistic and suicidal as well. Pointing out that they’re materialistic does not prove they want to live; the pleasures of expensive wine enjoyed by a Hillary Clinton or underage girls by the husbands of these harridans is just to dull the pain (Bill Maher is rich and famous, but have you ever seen him looking anything but miserable?). Continuing with the metaphor (and closing my own loop) the ruling class is like an oven whose job is to cook food, that has somehow become sentient and decided it would rather continue heating until the coil elements start an electrical fire and burn down the house with its inhabitants. Should be an interesting few years. Merry CHRISTmas.

        I always thought what Perot ran on, the loss of manufacturing jobs (the Giant Sucking Sound) and the national debt problem, struck a chord with many Americans.  He couldn’t win the election, though, because most weren’t ready to make a break from the establishment.  While Trump has many faults, exposing and ridiculing the establishment press isn’t one of them.  Same with his exposure of the establishment voting process.

            You’d think after 12 years of Bushes, the blindfold would be off and people would have enough of Team “R”.
Yet here we are, the “Fate of the Republic” rests on two nothingburgers in GA winning their runoff Senate races.

            Limbaugh had lined up against him (no small thing at the time) saying that he wasn’t serious.  Fair or not, his choice of Admiral Stockdale as VP fed in to the storyline that he was running more on some personal grudge with Bush than some high-minded crusade.  In hindsight this was not fair as a non-establishment candidate isn’t exactly going to have his pick of administrative personnel (see: Trump).

                Limbaugh made some good points, one I remember was Perot wanted to raise the sales tax on gas by .50, back when that meant something. But if had been more economically aware, I would have realized has destructive Nafta would be, something Limbaugh supported.

                    Yeah me too, here’s the thing with that though: I grew up seeing my parents repeatedly get taken by crappy American cars and they weren’t able to get anything reliable until they could buy Japanese.  A big part of the anti-NAFTA argument was American automotive relying on a bank of goodwill that they had squandered decades earlier.  Add in to that fact the unions pushing against NAFTA made it their business to support every anti-American idea that came down the pipe and that meant that there was no effective opposition to what turned out to be a really bad idea.  (Another facet was the “hostage technique” where manufactures said that they wouldn’t have to important cheap labor anymore since NAFTA meant that they could put their plants where the cheap labor was, but that bit wasn’t all that believable even to my brainwashed teenage ears).

            Perot was a bit before his time.  Our major institutions were still in good standing.  MSM was believed and had little competition.  Voting was still basically considered fair with the occasional blip.  Law enforcement at Federal level considered unimpeachable. Whites were still the undisputed majority, if divided.
This is all gone now.  Now the fun starts.

        This is an edgier version of Z’s TakiMag article from yesterday. The Sturm und Drang process of republican government always depended on a reasonable ruling class to ward off disaster. We didn’t have those reasonable people in the 1850s and we don’t have them today. The Media Class is hell-bent on seizing power with the help of their political shills, and the “opposition” is nowhere to be found (with the possible exception of golf courses). Unless we find leadership that is unafraid of risking their “lives, fortunes, and sacred honor”, we have no choice but to rebel without them.

            Well, here is a thought.  Can you name the leader of the Taliban?  And yet, they are set for their third victory over a worldwide superpower, using only improvised and second hand weaponry.  We don’t need leaders, we need a movement.  “Emergent conduct” or whatnot, per Z’s recent podcast, is more effective than any organization.

        If you think the election in major cities, especially in the North has ever been legitimate, well, you are a low information citizen. As a young kid growing up at the time people spoke freely in front of me often. I was privy to much.I can talk about all of this now because everyone, literally, is dead.My mothers side of the family was Italian and my uncle was a Chicago City Manager under old man Daley. So we are talking 50, 60 years ago plus.Everyday a large black Caddy would pick him up for work. I think at the time there were 4 managers.When he retired my cousin took the job, which under the “new” minority Democrats became rather impotent position, and today the entire city infrastructure machine is run by blacks and hispanics, zero whites. My cousin never got a Caddy and a driver.The entire family worked for machine in all departments: asphalt was JoeyD, forestry was Junior, health department Bud, Rose and Carm were in records Louis sanitation, Ribby,…. on and on and on. And many of their spouses, kids, cousins, etc.You needed a tree removed? Done. You needed a driveway coated? Done. You needed a phony birth certificate to start working at 15? Done.Anyway, the gist of the story is many uncles/family members were also Precinct captains and they had a specific job on election day. When any city employee came in they were to stick their head behind the curtain to make sure they pulled the handle for Daley.No pull for Daley, no job tomorrow. And they really didn’t even hide this ploy much.This is just one way they controlled the vote. Just imagine the rest.This was before the days of cameras and poll watchers. Today we have a seen a little of it thanks to camera technology, but there is nothing new under the left wing fascist Sun.There is no winning against this system, and Obama after 8 years instituted nationally in all strong holds. The fix is complete.The difference is those in charge are now all black, with a smattering of radical Hispanics. Whites are finished in these areas. Eventually finished nationally if nothing changes.It is rather ironic. The machine system created by whites is now used to eradicate them. This is how stupid, as a race, we have been.

Sailer talks all the time about black propensity for criminality, and one has to take him at his word that he actually believes what he writes, and yet here is faced with that very prospect and he buries his head in the sand

Everyone talks about “Italians assimilated” or Poles, Irish, French, etc
Ok, many did, but many never did and still live in ethnic enclaves. Guidos are a running joke, for example. Or Irish Townies. Look at Cubans in Dade. or Cajuns in Louisiana. Not much assimilation there.

        For another glimpse, Charles Murray admitted on Twitter that he voted for Biden.  He said he didn’t reluctantly because Trump is not Presidential.  He did not respond with any further explanation or justification that I saw.  He also regularly praises his AEI colleague Jonah Goldberg, even though Goldberg is the personification of an intellectual lightweight and doesn’t defend Murray when the mob gets ginned up after him.

He said he didn’t reluctantly because Trump is not Presidential.
Not presidential, eh? Perhaps somebody can correct me, but I cannot recall him regularly banging the ‘white guilt’, ‘white supremacy’, ‘apologize for your history’ war-drums – like almost every other ‘Presidential’ candidate.

                Murray and Sailer are two of a kind.  Eternal civnats with eternal  justifications and qualifications for everything.  How many times has Sailer discussed black employment, yet he and his acolytes are at it again. Yet he will never use his platform to push explicitly White issues and solutions.  These are people to be jettisoned, not lauded.  They anchor one in the eternal past.

            “not Presidential”
That’s literally the dumbest criteria for voting.
Sad that Murray isn’t brave enough to admit that he’s simply a tard.

                I think the direct quote is that he “sighed and reluctantly voted for Biden.”  Even if being “not Presidential” was his criteria, what about Joe Biden is Presidential?  If the woke mob ever amassed enough power to throw people in prison for thought crimes, Murray would be an early target and Biden would eagerly sign off on it.  He actively voted against his own interests based on standards that he knows full well were shredded decades ago.

                Quite a few people have bought into the “vote for Biden because Trump is non-presidential” thing.  Because decorum matters more than endless Middle East wars, illegal aliens stealing all the work and gibs, selling out to China, and strip mining the people of the Republic, for the benefit of the privileged few.  Got it, right, your feelz are more important than anything else here.  We are so screwed…

                    Quite right. I have a family member who is in academia and he is from the GHW Bush wing of the Republican party. If I bring up Trumps name in any conversation, I get the audible groan, along with the obligatory “I can’t believe you voted for him!”. Anyway, whenever he goes off on one of these tirades, I usually silence him with the following; “For the last twenty years, you and those like you have forever bitched about things like fighting back and knocking the left back on their heels and yet here he is and you still aren’t happy, why?”It always devolves into the same thing; Trump is rude, Trump is “unpresidential”, Trump shouldn’t get involved in the day to day fighting. My response has always been, “So you don’t like him because he’s unafraid to fight back against the left, while your guys either won’t say a word, or bend over and grab their ankles like a prison bitch and give the left what they want anyway. This always gets him to change the subject. What really sets him off is when I confront him with, “If you’re really upset about Trump getting elected, you have only people like yourself to blame. After all, people like you are what made a Donald Trump Presidency possible. People like me got tired of losing and got fed up with people like you controlling the party and who got the nomination.”

            Murray is from Iowa, and middle-class Midwesterners simply can’t stand Trump’s personality.
That said, while Murray may be HBD aware, he’s not pro-White. There’s a difference. You see it every day in Sailer’s comments.

                None-the-less, Murray has been instrumental in moving the basic issues forward and making them known to a wide audience.  Whether you believe he is HBD aware, or agrees with such, he was out there in the mid-90’s before most everyone else.  Most all his publications and interviews push the basic tenants of the movement forward.
Seems in this group, if you not are screaming from the rooftop wrt things we commonly acknowledge, you are cast into the void, when in reality folks like Murray have done more for the cause than any of us could ever hope to do.

                    I have a different read on Murray. I think if he was as forthright today as he was thirty years ago about the issues that brought him to our attention, no one could lay a finger on him. Instead, he has put his energies into distancing himself from those who read his books and accepted his conclusions. To many it sounds like a betrayal.
The voting for Biden stuff is a perfect example. He chose to make that public. He wants people to know he is not on our side. That’s fine with me. Everyone has to choose sides.

This. Murray concludes that race is real and races differ. He concludes that Whites have achieved magnificent things.
Then he sides with those who deny this – except, of course, in their hatred of Whites – and openly pine for the destruction of the European peoples.

                    I see your point and agree somewhat. Murray in the 1990s and early 2000s was making important arguments and, frankly, was pretty brave since there was a good chance he’d be tossed into the void.He even tried to show the dire straits of much of White America in Coming Apart.For that, he deserves praise and our thanks.But he also seems to show true disdain for populist Whites. His hatred for Trump showed that. Yes, a good amount of that comes from his Midwestern antipathy to loudmouths, but Murray is smart enough to separate the man from his ideas.Murray knows exactly what a Biden presidency means for Whites, yet he voted for him and made that known publicly. For decades, Murray has been aware what immigration would mean for Whites and the country as a whole, but he consistently sides with those who will continue that path.But you’re right. His work on HBD moves the ball forward, but it’s amazing to me that he continues to have no sympathy for his own people. “Yes, race is real. Yes, the races are different. But I could care less if Whites are destroyed and turned into helots.”It’s just weird. He’s chosen to side with those who hate our people. At least your typical progressive can feign stupidity.

                Something about midwesterners. Most of the republican leadership from the midwest were doormats – Bob Michael, Denny Hastert (perv as well), Grassley etc. The last fighters were in the 1950s – McCarthy and Taft.

                    Upper Midwest people are a special breed. They literally worship “niceness.” Don’t be boastful. Don’t talk about your wealth. Don’t be loud. Etc.
It’s why the Japanese used to (maybe still do) liked to do business with Minnesotans. They both were terrified of being rude.
Appeal their niceness, and you can’t lose. They value it over everything.

            Even in his prime, Biden was never “presidential” and the 2020 dementia patient version is definitely not “presidential”. It lets you know the moral fiber of these Never Trumpers that they disregard the evidence that Joe is already bought and paid for by the Chinese and a dozen other countries and that he overlooked meth head Hunter reportedly raping little Chinese girls and banging his 16 year old granddaughter.

        That is absolutely shocking that Steve Sailer said there was no evidence of election fraud. Nothing could be more obvious. You know, I saw those ballots in Georgia. The Sunday before the election I drove up to the mountains and I was just north of the city driving past the Fulton County Annex and there is a U-Haul parked in the street with its hazards on and a bunch of black guys wheeling black suitcases into the annex. I knew something was wrong when I saw it and now course I know what it was

            Yes, hunger ala Holodomor or Gorta Mor [Irish – great famine] is an obvious card to play, although hungry works better than dying.Meaning Hungry people are easier to control than starving people.  All that is necessary is for the money to become worthless for transactions and the American food distribution system collapses.  As the only thing necessary for the $ to become worthless is Price Discovery it may happen anyway.

                    Their population was much smaller. The introduction of the potato allowed northern European populations to grow much further than old world crops that aren’t as comfortable with cool climatesThe potato had similar effects on us Finns and we went from a population of a hundred thousand to millions with it. Then we eventually ended up with 19th century famines when the blight hit and there was nothing that could quickly replace the potato to feed that population.

        Remember ’92 well and was one of those people realizing that once the Cold War was over, our “elites” really had no idea what to do.  (Read “While We’ll Soon Miss the Cold War”–published back around 90-91in the Atlantic) Voted for Perot because he seemed to be the only guy, in his quirky way, that realized what was “next”.  But something very different in the air now.  The benefit of Trump being elected is all pretense and subtlety was dropped by our erstwhile masters in the effort to mount an immune response to the Trump virus.  And don’t believe there is any way to reel that back in with calls for “unity”.  Hot, cold or in between, it’s war now.

        Perot was right about a lot of things but his weirdness about his daughters wedding or whatever that issue was kinda gave me pause. Buchanan was a normal guy. Perot nor Trump are quite as normal and stable as Buchanan was. Trump has his weird baggage too. I just wished the nation would have seen the value of Pat Buchanan.But it is what it is.We need a new system not the cucky Republicans of Conservative Inc today.I oppose Ann Coulter and her vindeta against all things Trump.

                Ann has been right about Trump every step of the way. She was right to endorse him and she was right to warn about him. She might be a loyalist, but within that framework, she’s been bang on the money from day one.

                    Was she bang on the money when she slobbered over Chris Christie or Romney?
Let me answer for you.  No
Does she take immigration restriction seriously if she has spread her legs for Christie and Romney ?  And Romney, a Mormon, whose entire m.o. is finding more warm bodies for the mother church, like he was ever going to be opposed to immigration from Mexico when his family was down there recruiting and living for a time and he staffs his houses with Mexicans.
She’s a fraud, and I’m glad Fuentes finally called her out

I said she’s been right about Trump, but who would you have endorsed rather than Romney? “Nobody” is not an answer – we’ve already established she believes in the system like a good Boomer, so it’s a game of picking the least damaging to America.
She’s a fraud, and I’m glad Fuentes finally called her out.
Fraud? That’s a new one, what you usually hear is “she sells too many books”.

I bet Trump doesn’t hire Mexicans.

                            Trump’s faults don’t excuse hers
And IIRC it wasn’t that she jumped on the Romney bandwagon after he had secured the nomination but rather pumping him at the onset of the primaries or even before. She was a huge Romney groupie from way back
I get that you find some value in her.  I respect that.  I just don’t have a lot of love for the person.

            Victor Hanson rightly points out that most game changers inevitably come with certain baggage that generally causes the populace to reject them once their utility is exhausted.  Think Churchill turned from office at the end of WWII.  A (correct) crank before the war, only leader with the guts not to sue for peace.  But he also had a staunchly colonialist mindset and was no fan of “vibrancy”.  So off he went.

            Considering Bush I was head of the CIA and his son’s (Bush II) first instinct was to set up a massive domestic surveillance state on 9/11 makes you think, you know, maybe Perot might have been onto something when he talked about his family being spied on for political reasons.Because he was ex-military, ex-Naval Academy, and part of his company was in pre-fall Shah of Iran, you can bet that he had CIA contacts friendly to him.  Hell, they might have been on the payroll.He probably knew a lot more than he could ever say in public without getting arrested. No one would have believed it in the innocent days of the 90’s. He was an old school patriot anyway; would’ve kept his mouth shut if asked.

                A Wall Street firm (Walston) had a practice of stringing along career middle executives with low pay but the promise of a huge pension plan benefit after 20 years, and then find a reason to fire them after 18, and keep the money.  Perot’s firm (EDS) bought out Walston and put a quick stop to that crap.  Perot was an honest guy.

            What Fuentes et. al. gets wrong is hitching their wagon to TRUMP. I support them 100% if their message is about voter fraud, but turning this whole thing into supporting MY LEADER TRUMP is embarrassing. Trump doesn’t give a shit about Fuentes or Ali. He gives a shit about his daughter, and golfing, and Twitter. I think the likes of Coulter and Enoch pick up on this, and won’t fully support a movement that is lionizing TRUMP in this way.

                At this point, there is no way to separate Trump from the issue of election fraud. A few weeks from now, expect that separation to happen. Fuentes and the Zoomers will re-position to a post-Trump world.

        The CCP has successfully infiltrated our government, in both a top-down and bottom-up fashion, with little or no opposition. They have established Maoist strongholds by indoctrination and struggle session style enforcement in our schools.
That element is now being extracted from the fabric of our culture, leaving in its wake some interesting holes we should view as doors of opportunity. We should be filling this vacuum.
The lockdowns were purposed to prevent grassroots movements from forming in opposition to globalist enforcements.  If this is their perception of the threat, then be the threat.

            Totally agree
they have taken over America without firing a shot
One would think the USSR would have been more effective at it in their day, but they lacked China’s money. All that time China was thinking “We use Soviet tactics but we build our economy and pay them off. Yipeee!!!!”
Chris Matthews years before he went off the rails said as much, that American businessmen would sell China the rope to hang us

        The Ron Paul movement was another attempt at reform. It was hampered by his libertarianism and professorial demeanor. Even though he represented the largest minority bloc in the GOP, They shut him down, not allowing even a 1 minute speech at either convention. McCain and Romney, both odious, especially couldn’t tolerate Paul’s criticism of the Forever Wars. That gave Trump a big issue when he ran in 2016.

            Even leftists at the time thought Ron Paul was getting the shaft. (This was a bare 8 years ago when leftists were still anti-war.) Paul deserves a place at the table with Perot and Buchanan. Though when Paul’s time came, the uniparty and media was hopelessly corrupt and didn’t give him a chance. If it was 4 or 8 years earlier, he may have gotten Perot-like support.

                R. Paul had the audacity to introduce a bill returning rule of law to the legislators and away from the unelected administrators.Judicial law, by elected representative legislators, includes separation of powers executive, legislative, and judicial; right to trial by peers, discovery, and appeal; and a presumption of innocence.Administrative law has none of these protections, being judge, jury, and executioner.Administrative law began in 1888 with the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Our first socialist diktator, FDR, with the help of his imported army of USSR Communists, created hundreds of agencies that bypassed the Republic’s governmental limits.Re Ron Paul, the Swamp struck back, protecting itself.

        The third way, of course, is the purely outsider movement. This is when the unrepresented create an alternative outside the ruling coalition. They either peacefully compel the ruling elite to acknowledge their interests or they replace the ruling elite, and the system they rule, with a new elite and a new system. This is exactly what happened with the American Revolution. A new elite replaced the old elite and created a system that worked for them to replace the old system.Thats not what happened with the American revolution.  Most of the leaders had been leaders in the colonial era. They were all elites – wealthy and influential people.   What they did was eliminate the foreign domination and the limits it imposed on them – a large percentage of the grievance in the DoI are royal limits on their governments.  They rationalized the separation with natural rights and other sentiments that they clearly did not fully believe.  Those ideas were then internalized and took on a life of their own as the founding myths of the new country.The situation today is much different.  The dissidents are completely outside the system.  An analog to pre revolutionary America would be state and local governments rebelling against the central government – roughly what happened in the Civil War in 1860.   But today, the local and state governments are at least as pozed as the central government,  many more so.And there is similarity of thought and purpose between the central and local governments than existed in the colonial era, or really, any other in US history.  And the culture of the political elites has also subsumed the business and cultural elites.Coordination has replaced the tension that previously existed – which creates a type of American fascism – (one aspect of this is that businesses do not pursue profit in the marketplace in the way they did in the past – political considerations have replaced customer attraction as the prime driver of business decisions).  The elites are more unified and broader than ever before and also (perhaps as a consequence) more estranged from the large society than ever before.  It truly is coming to resemble a foreign military occupation more than anything else.

        An intelligent ruling oligarchy would have co-opted allof these movements,taking up some of their positions, taking in some of their members, moderating some of their own extremists, and generally neutering the movements, and there is ample precedent for this, it’s basically how the British aristocracy headed off a French-style revolution,and won another 130-150 years of de-facto rule. But so great is the hatred and contempt of our ruling class for ordinary Americans, they can’t do this, even though it would be in their own self-interest. And if you leave people with no alternative s other than revolution, secession, or both, well, don’t act surprised when that’s what you get.

            It was the ascendancy of the Minoritarian Jews, who have positioned themselves as unshakably opposed to White Christian Gentiles being in charge, that has brought on the crisis.Cast an eye back over the last 30-50 years and find their influence constantly working toward the disempowerment, and ultimately, the demographic replacement of White Christian Gentiles, the people who devised the republican governance that built the country. Chosenites at the helm in every crucial node, gnawing at the wires and undermining the foundational prerequites for republican governance. Republican governance permitted of a truly substantial degree of diversity within the populace; but for them, with their insatiable desire to arrogate power without any possible pushback, the imposition of an increasingly centralized and monolithic federal government indistinguishable from an autocratic form of governance has been their desired solution. Ironically, the vitiation of local or regional variation instead of increasing national power, has made the nation highly succeptible to being weakened by other more focused nations, or by transnational corporations other globalist institutions. But, despite this, the Little Hats love them that shit; fewer checks on self-dealing, wider scope for same, and increased opportunities for exploiting hot capital flows for enrichment and, should things get dicey for the Tribe, as a means of capital flight for relocation.

        Slight off-topic tangent:The Declaration always struck me as a post hoc justification for what the founders were going to do anyways.

Who sounds like the more reasonable party?Especially enjoyed this line from the Brits: “No precise, unequivocal terms of submission to the authority of Parliament in any case, have ever been offered by any Assembly. A concession has only produced a further demand, and I verily believe if every thing had been granted short of absolute Independence, they would not have been contented; “

        I have read Sailer for almost 20 years and like him, but you’re right about him. I remember the Sailer vs. Jared Taylor “citizenism” debate – I sided with Taylor.I was always aware that I am fundamentally different than Sailer. He has indicated that making blacks empirically equal is a desirable thing – it just isn’t likely to work. This never resonated with me. I have nothing against blacks but my instinct is to root for my people  – I like the idea of us being better at everything compared to every other group.

                        In his citizenism argument with Taylor, he said identity politics for whites won’t ever happen because whites want to marry who they want to marry, don’t want to be racist, etc. He sees the boomer world instead and ignores the pre-boomer world. All of my grandparents were “racist” my great-grandparents, even more so.

I’ve always wondered if he’s trying to sneak inside the mainstream. He seems to frequently suggest (with no proof) that so-and-so mainstream figure probably reads him.

            This has nothing to do with taking a stand out of constitutional concerns or ethical reasons.  Texas is the death box for nationwide GOP power of any kind.  The Republicans there have to be kept happy and on the plantation.  Secondly, Ted Cruz is clearly running in 2024.  He’ll be running against Nikki Haley and Marco Rubio.  And possibly Trump himself.  By running point on this he can prove Trump loyalty, inoculating himself from being a turn coat, while attacking him and also bring on the Trump block instead of having it go to the other two, assuming he can knock off Trump himself.  O course none of the four will be elected in 2024.  The GOP is finished.  It’s all community theater.

                The Texas suit seems to have been brought, in large measure at least, by the Texas AG.  Referring to your comment, I’m not sure how Cruz or anyone else figures into it.  Basically, the Texas suit is claiming injury because other states engaging in unconstitutional (state level) voting procedures that have diluted the Texas vote and disenfranchised the Texas electorate … something like that.

        Actually both Coulter and Fuentes were wrong, with a circular chicken and egg argument.  Fuentes was wrong to support Trump  given all of his anti-white baggage.  Coulter is wrong to support the GA Senate candidates, who are both establishment ghouls.  Both of them should be anti-Trump and anti-Vapid Establishment Senate candidates.  As Coulter pointed out, Fuentes doesn’t have the capital to oppose the little crooked politicians when he spent it all supporting the big crooked politician.  But that only makes Coulter wrong on all counts herself.

            Fuentes is a kid and is going to make mistakes
He’s still learning about life
Ann has no excuse, and she’s been all over the place slobbering over Chris Christie, Romney, trump.  She’s a friggin groupie without the guts to go after rock stars so she goes after politicians
Screw her.

                I’m talking about the arguments themselves not the personae behind the arguments or their motives.  Just because Coulter is used up doesn’t make her wrong on immigration or other things.  On this issue Fuentes is half right and she’s all wrong.

                        Anyone in her profession, playing the narrow field, has to be thought of as a fraud first, and then you go from there.  Who’s not a fraud in that arena?  Pure activists are generally too boring for media consumption.  By the way I also give Fuentes a pass on that for the same reason.  I really don’t see her as a groupie though.  I do see her as a high end Manhattan bar fly who loves attention.  I also see her as bisexual for some reason.  But not because she hates men.  I think she has a very male mind.  She reminds me of some of the female science majors in college.

But yeah, for me as a “true believer” and lover of Western Civilization, that she has turned its demise into a way to make lots of money is never going to sit well with me.  So I am glad when a Fuentes comes along and calls her out  from a rightward position.   She thinks this is all fun and games.  It’s not.

            Ja, Wild Geese, this isso crystal clear.It is truly odious; Sailer and the commenter,”That would be telling”, need to get a room. While Sailer may have somewhat legitimate concerns about his immune system after his close call with cancer, the kowtowing to that commenter, who is pointlessly rude, and given to ad hominems instead of answering considered criticisms, is really beyond the pale.What really browned me off was the post with the headline announcing the death of Chuck Yeager with no commentary from him about Yeager, but rather an extended non sequitur about the black baseball player, Richie Allen. Surprised he didn’t then launch on to another non sequitur about golf, maybe about Tiger Woods, once the course of the post was established. I mean, fuck, Yeager was the quintessential white guy hero, and not a word? Mind-forged manacles -particularly those clamped tight by oneself – are a terrible thing.

                Yeah, the Yeager thing was just odd – I mean, if you want to go yammering on about Richie Allen, create a separate post. Beside, I was a baseball fan around that time, and I didn’t even remember Allen until Sailer mentioned him, it’s not like he was DiMaggio or Mantle or anything – he was a surly proto-Knee Taker who had a few good years. Even putting him in the same paragraph with Yeager is outrageous.

        I’d go as far to say the “system” is really our race and as long it is only us within it that reform might be possible.
personally, I just can’t see how reform is possible as long as blacks are here.  ((()))s are also a problem but they can be constrained with some will power, and they reflexively and rather peacefully revert back to that outsider position like a cat picked up by the scruff. ,

            The Regime has the courts, media, Finance, 100 million supporters at least, most of the govt, the major political party, the other party is a captive opposition, academia, the schools, the Foundations.The real opposition are cowards, scattered, refuse to play their cards, think bitching is resistance, and have the souls of peasants.This will go on forever, as it is the normal state of man.  For it to end the regime will have to push around the wrong group – say military or police – and then in theory there will at last be an opposition for the peasants (you) to rally around.  This is only theoretical at this point, but that hope is all you have.

        Prior to the American Revolution, or the next battle in the War of the Three Kingdoms, none of the critics of hereditary regents or advocates of democracy bothered to take a vote of the general populace to ascertain their enthusiasm for a break with the UK. In fact, those that were voluble in their wish to remain British subjects were scorned, intimidated and physically attacked. After it was over the instigators became the lords. The effects of the Declaration were very much circumscribed, as they are to this day.

        They either peacefully compel the ruling elite to acknowledge their interests or they replace the ruling elite, and the system they rule, with a new elite and a new system. This is exactly what happened with the American Revolution. A new elite replaced the old elite and created a system that worked for them to replace the old system.I have to disagree here.  The AR was not an example of the emergence of a new elite.What happened was a geographically isolated faction of junior members of the old elite asserted themselves. The “new elite” was not new, they were well-established plantation owners.  I see no faction in the current political landscape that could pull of something similar.

                The second war with Iraq would have happened in a year or two, followed by war with Iran. Domestically, it would have been much like Bush 2.0. Perot bought us some time, which was squandered. Trump bought us some time. We bets not squander it again.

                A second term of GHW Bush would possibly have meant that the Clinton Crime Machine would not have gotten off the ground. Even if Clinton ran again in 1996, the long memory of the internet was starting to crank up.Billary would not have had time to really pile on the cash what with Bill’s blossoming STDs &amp; Hilly’s neurological issues starting to take off.I’d miss Monica, though.

                Absolutely. The second Clinton term and the sole GHWB term were indistinguishably bad for the United States. It is easy to forget but in Clinton’s first term, for example, he was against open borders. His Jewish rescuers turned him around for his second four years.
GHWB gave us the cancer of globalism, and it briefly went into remission in 1993 and again in 2016, but the prognosis appears terminal.

                Has anyone ever seriously speculated what a second term of George H.W. Bush been like? Other than extending the careers of 30-40 Democrats in Congress in the 1994 election, what would have happened?I suspect Al Gore would have run in 1996 and likely won. Colin Powell would likely have been the Republican nominee to own da libs. Gore would have done very little different than Clinton and Dubya. We would have kept bombing, sanctioning, and starving Iraqis, the PATRIOT Act would have found some other way to get passed although perhaps watered down as without a 9/11 overcorrection, it would be tougher to swallow.Long story short, the silver lining would be that Bill and Hillary would likely have topped out as cabinet position holders, maybe spared the impeachment circus of the late 90s but everything else remaining the same.A good what if scenario is if Nixon won 1960. I think a lot of the Great Society garbage would have been watered down or scrapped. The mafia who fixed Chicago and Kansas City results likely didn’t realize what they wreaked on society but given the ethnicity of a lot of the mafia, they likely wouldn’t have minded.

            Thought Perot was a ‘nutter until I read “On Wings of Eagles” by Ken Follet. Wish I’d read it before Bush II rose to office.Would your boss hire a mercenary team to rescue you abroad, after explicitly being told by the State Dept. he’d go to jail if he did so? Mine sure as heck wouldn’t .That’s Ross Perot. Patriot and populist, and boy howdy I wished he’d thrashed the Bush dynasty and served 2 terms.The Bushes trashed a good man in pursuit of a multi-generational political dynasty, which is all they really know how to do. Power for powers sake.

                I read “On Wings of Eagles” a couple of years before the election, so I was an enthusiastic Perot voter.  Yeah, he was quirky, but so what?  Just liked he cared for and felt responsibility for his employees, he wanted to save America and the American workers’ jobs that were going to Mexico and other countries.

                        But who, in the early 90s, could have foreseen that the Left would hijack capitalism itself for its own purposes? To me, this sorry phenomenon is perhaps the most bizarre outcome of the post-Cold War era.

                                “the upper middle class hijacked the Left”I’m not sure what that’s supposed to mean, but I would very much like an explanation for how a presumably non-Leftist socioeconomic group could hijack a political movement. But, of course, that never happened. What did happen is that young Leftists, brainwashed by academia, entered corporate America in the 90s, converted corporations to Leftism (anti-white racism), and have since been using corporations to further Leftist agendas. The old dyad of socialist/Leftist capitalist/rightist no longer obtains.

                                    A lot of what’s happened is summed up in that boring sounding economics phrase “regulatory capture”.  Large corporations realized that supporting a vast expansion of the state was a good way to not only crush their smaller rivals in business but to bring in government directly as an enforcement arm of business and thus leverage the tax base in service of pushing around workers and the commoners.  Previously, you had people like Andrew Carnegie hiring their own private armies like the Pinkerton’s.  Modern business outsources that shit to government and thus doesn’t pay a penny for it.How do you get a vast expansion of the state in a constitutionally limited Republic though?  Simple, you make cynical use of Left wing populist (and often outright Communist) rhetoric and organizations to coat what you’re doing in “social justice and equality” goo.  Think of it as a sly bacterium covering itself in its hosts’ mucus to fool its immune system.You can see the ultimate outworking of this in the slavering enthusiasm of big business for every new Covid-branded political imposition.  Sure, having your employees mumbling at each other through masks and standing 6′ apart is bad for internal communication but the small efficiency hit from that is more than made up for my the destruction of all those pesky small businesses.This is the future as our ruling class sees it.  Corporations and the state blend together in a seamless totalitarian fabric from which escape is virtually impossible.  It’s not exactly Communism as the Marxists saw it but it does resemble the Soviet system as it was in fact practiced.  The Soviets had even incorporated (hehe) a kind of competitive incentive into their system eventually.  Look up “design bureau”.  You know how some Russian fighters are “Sukhoi” models and others are “MIG” (Mikoyan and Gurevich)?  Those are the two big aircraft design bureaus in the USSR.  They were de-facto competing corporations Soviet times and are now actual Russian corporations.

                            Even back then there was enough history to see that the wealthy definitely leaned Left. Corporations never put up much opposition to affirmative action etc. The philanthropic foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and McArthur and many more showed this since at least the 1950s. I thought this was simple infiltration but it is far too widespread for that. They were set up that way.

                                There may be some truth to that. However, prior to the 90s corporations were at most haltingly, not thoroughgoingly antiwhite. What we’ve seen in the last 30 years is corporations exponentially ramping up their hatred of YT and adoration of the Hutu.

                        This crisis will be resolved either in collapse or by lead, maybe both.Back in the day, before the China trade really as for the reasons nothing seemed to get fixed were  money as speech  and  money grubbing.What making it so bad now is it appears both parties have extreme moral rot on top of being owned by foreign interests.I’m not a Q Anon guy but I tend to think the recent rumor that Georgia’s Republican governor was compromised by the Chinese Intelligence that was found at the Embassy in his state   to be entirely believable.This is  Graham Allison’s Thucydides Trap only fought by economics and subversion rather than armies,

Once their members are free agents, they won’t be bound by the party package deals such as low taxes for forever wars or support for social security if you accept the third world invasion.The big threat is the current elite setting up new traps disguised as political parties.

        One old cliche’ found in nearly every economics publication since the early 1990’s is that China will be this free, open, democratic country in (insert future timeframe) bur RIGHT NOW they tolerate a kleptoctracy that makes all important decisions in smoke filled rooms.  They say they do this because the kleptocracy has been making it rain for the little guy in China and as long as the Chinese see economic progress, they don’t mind their rulers.  But one day, when China stalls out…look out!  Well….why don’t they apply this rhetoric to Washington D.C.?   One can arguably say that the real economy stalled out in 1999/2000.  The financial economy stalled out in 2007/2008, and ever since then we have smoke filled rooms of kleptocrats giving us an ever lower standard of living.  So by their own logic, the American people SHOULD be up in arms right about now.  But no.  They don’t see themselves as a corrupt oligarchy, but a benevolent group of Anderson Cooper types who just need to be listened to, because they “know better.”   The truth about oligarchies of all types is that they’re only strong armed out of their chairs.  It can come in various ways, but in the end our oligarchy will likely be less durable than the Chinese one.

            The thing to keep in mind was that by the early nineties, not only had we reformed Japan and Germany into respectable junior superpowers but we had defeated the Soviet empire with a ploy similar to the Chinese scheme.  Thus far the scheme has been a abysmal failure in many important ways, but it may yet win out should China lose control of the debt-dragon that they’re riding (not that I really care at this point).

                I don’t think we “defeated” the Soviets. Their business model wasn’t working, just like the Corleone family left the olive oil business. We sent some “free market advisors” from Harvard (yeah, right!) to privatize the state assets which just happened to end up in the hands of mid-level jewish technocrats who somehow found the financial resources to do so despite being a “persecuted minority”.

            From what little I know of the Chinese State it seems to be to a fairly large degree a meritocracy, and seems to enjoy a large majority of support among the people.There’s a guy over at Unz who seems fairly well informed whose name escapes me (and after the rigors of filling in for Skeptic16’s indolence I can’t be bothered to look him up) He’s a bit too effusive but his opinion is largely consistant with observable facts.I particularly like the way China regularly decides some Mayor or other middle ranker is corrupt and relieves him of his head in  less than a month. It must concentrate the mind of the others.

        Out of curiosity, at what age does this “Nick Fuentes is just a kid and is going to make mistakes” schtick no longer work?  And if he’s just a kid why do his arguments have salience?  I see someone with a very high EQ who is playing to a faction that is so underserved and underrepresented that we have few options other than giving him a forum.  And notice how the dissident forum is almost completely devoid of boomers other than the lone boomer Paul Ramsey, going from old man Derbyshire straight to various Gen Xers and younger.  There’s a giant hole in dissident representation centered around the boomers.

                I hope it is.  I don’t trust him.  But I don’t care either because so few people say what he’s saying that, sure, pass him the megaphone.  I won’t quibble until he goes off the reservation.  I didn’t care for his AZ Trump stuff lately.  But I can also see a lot of dissidents being coaxed out of the Trump movement.  So once again I give him a pass.  I am, however, very uneasy about the whole ‘latin mass dissident” thing.  It connotes implicit institutional trust.  Trust where none is due, and centering around unbalanced clergy.

I’m just glad SOMEONE is calling out people like Coulter and Tucker.  Coulter used to like to say that her criticism of Trump was just her keeping his feet to the fire.   Well, now shoe is on her foot and she doesn’t seem to be liking it.
Tucker especially needs it because he seems prone to flights of fancy

                        Speaking of Tucker, at least Coulter prefers NY and LA to DC.  Tucker actually lives inside the district.  AND, he wore a bow tie for years.  There’s nothing anti-establishment about Tucker.  I don’t like anyone who would like that town.  What he’s doing is gently telling his own that they’ll be beheaded one day if they don’t shape up.  They’ll have none of it of course.  My favorite episode was when he attempted to pretend to know the Korean family in his neighborhood that owned some looted shop.  Bull…f-ing…shit.  And by the way, that Korean likely pays taxes on about 20% of his real income, which is good for him, but he’s not suffering.  It’s the dumb whitey in flyover country who pays all his taxes that’s not doing well.

I’m glad to see it
But we’re from CA and have highly  calibrated b.s. meters b/c our survival depends on it.  People in flyover country are far more innocent and more easily duped by the likes of Tucker.
But seems like everyone is catching on.  About time.  And we are all better off for it.

                            Tucker has gone wobbly and I was just thinking about the bow-tie that he used to wear.  That never sat well with me and he seems to be showing his true colors although i haven’t watched him in probably a month.  I’m done with all of the Foxnews guys.

                    For a little context of the Latin Mass Dissident thing, remember that the institution you decry all but banned the TLM, and had to be dragged kicking and screaming into tolerating it on an extremely limited basis.  The very unbalanced clergy you criticize are the ones who fought tooth and nail to destroy the TLM.  So being a TLM dissident is perfectly congruent with being an American ante-bellum restorationist..

        Anyone who attends American public school knows about the Declaration of Independence, if nothing else. It’s also regularly cited by the left because of the equality claptrap. The document is constantly used to legitimate the ruling class. It — not the Constitution — is the document they use. Nor is this new. Lincoln, incredibly enough, used it against southern independence! If you’re depending on the Declaration of Independence, you’ve already lost.The idea people have the right to remove their government comes a century earlier  from John Locke, anyhow.The gap between Fuentes on the one hand, and Sailer and Coulter, on the other is primarily generational — millennials vs. boomers. That said, while Coulter may be rehabilitated by the ruling class (although I suspect her hostility towards immigration has placed her beyond the Pale), Sailer will never be accepted. Race realism is a bridge too far.

        The GA runoff will tell us a lot. The eGOP is starting to internalize just how much Republican voters despise them.  Watch the Trump rally in GA from Saturday.  Loeffler is an unintelligent character with no charisma.  Perdue is a smarmy elitist.  When the crowd shouted them off the state with cries of “Fight for Trump!” we saw the death of the Republican Party playing out in real time.  It’s not that the eGOP doesn’t know we hate them.  The feeling is mutual.  BUT, up until this year they could count on voters to show up to “save the Senate” and “save the Court”.Fortunately, voters have caught onto the scam.  What good is a Senate that confirms Leftist judges who refuse to even listen to real evidence of vote fraud?  What good is a SCOTUS with a Chief Justice who is a traitor and wishy washy Uniparty judges who can barely muster the votes to rule that the government actually cannot ban people from going to church unless the government also bans restaurant seating.  Or something.  What good is either when the end result is churches rebranding as casinos to avoid being harassed by bureaucrats?Like I said in 2016, the surprise of the election was that Trump had discovered a theretofore unnoticed voting block consisting of half of America.  Thanks to the backstabbing duplicitous inaction by the eGOP (eg Kemp in GA), Republican voters no longer feel ANY need to GOTV.  There are a few, no doubt, but more and more on the blogs people are saying “eff them! They won’t help us, let them die.”We’re told it’s the duty of Republican voters to vote in GA, and others to give lots of money.  Increasingly, people view it as the duty of Patriots to keep their wallet closed and sit the election out.The legitimacy of the system is validated by the act of voting.  The system is illegitimate.  Voting at this point is stupid and wrong.

        “The Declaration of Independence was at the time and is today a very radical document, which is why our rulers don’t mention it much anymore.”The Declaration was NOT a “very radical document.” To the contrary, it was a very conservative document which cited the political theory of John Locke and the English understanding of government that had been established almost a century earlier by the Glorious Revolution and the English Bill of Rights.It was just as conservative in its day as it would be for right-wingers today to justify armed revolution based on the government’s routine violations of the First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Amendments and for acting outside the scope of the Enumerated Powers of Article I.

        You might recall that Perot dropped out of the race after getting frustrated with the way the media seized upon his verbal gaffes (e.g., calling a black audience “you people”.) He re-entered the race before election day and I’ve wondered how he would have fared if he had not temporarily dropped out.

            I remember the “you people” gaffe.  Of course, the media blew it out of proportion, but such is politics.  Didn’t he drop out due to his daughter getting death threats, and then he jumped back in?

        The Declaration of Independence was based in the biological reality of the people at that time.  That reality still stands, regardless of how untethered propagandized predictive programming takes us.  Next stop, extra terrestrial overlords that must be obeyed.  The fact we’re still here will be proof they’re the ones that saved us from climate change and covid.

            Have you heard about the recent monoliths that seem to be popping up in various locations?  Also, RT is reporting a story where an Israeli General (former?) has been in contact with alien life-forms. Get ready for the “mother of all hoaxes” … aliens have arrived!!

                Yes, I read that. We can see aliens, especially if we are brain chipped. The predictive programming for this one has been in the works for a long time.The German eugenicists from operation paperclip we took under our scientific wing must have led the way in creating a trans human species that will be marketed as extra terrestrial life, even though there has been no evidence of any in our solar system.It has always been my suspicion that the War of The Worlds radio broadcast that caused people to suicide was a military industrial complex psyop.Why do we need a trans human species? Because it takes too long to terraform a planet,  so we need a humanoid life form to colonize mars to survive the conditions there and perform this task for us.

        The ruling elite think they are geniuses. Just ask them. The FT over the weekend had an article about the collapse of luxury housing in NYC and noted before Beer Flu that NYC saw 1600 a month leave the city, net. Wealthy people are highly mobile and form the marginal revenue (surplus/deficit) for most local budgets. SF, LA, NYC, Portland, Seattle, are the wealthy mobile (often foreign) going to stick around for CHAZ 2.0? De Blasio and Garcetti supposedly boast Biden will just give them unlimited money from endless bailouts. Confusing the Biden Crime Family lining their pockets with what they will actually get.Yesterday the FT had an article on Disney’s streaming service. Its #2 with 90 million subscribers, Reed Hastings at Netflix thought they’d only get 20 million. BUT one analyst noted the subscription monthly price would have to rise from $12.99 to $55 a month to bring in the revenue their collapsing cable empire still brings in. ESPN streaming only has 5 million subs, Hulu more but Disney seems unwilling to sell or invest in it.And Disney doesn’t have new content. Much of their content can still be bought on ebay and the like, after screwing over Alan Dean Foster for royalties they are not a place most want to do business with new content. Other than the Mandalorian they are known for value destruction (Kathleen Kennedy) than creation. Political class writ large.

        Yeah I was a bit disappointed with steve sailer’s interview.  he didn’t seem to have any interest in being there and kind of blew off my superchat questions.  Maybe he was expecting more talk about boomersportsball

        “Perot ran as an outsider, on the back of his folksy observations about the federal government. Despite being very rich, he was clearly a man of the lower classes.”
Why do you assign Ross Perot to the “lower classes”?  Because of his Southern accent?

            Perot used folksy language … even described himself as an “ole cur dog” during a debate.  I think that he bailed out of the race when his daughter was getting death threats … and then he came back in.  That’s when people really lost interest.

            A.C. should not be out front because she is a woman, but what’s with this Year Zero mindset and punching right?  Coulter “threw trump under the bus” by daily tweeting “miles of wall built: zero”? Someone trying to push for the promised immigration restrictions is “not who we are?” The campaigning and highlighting our important issues (Adios America) for years is forgotten because muh personality spat? Act like a man, not a toddler.

                Right, but she’s pundit.   She doesn’t build things and have experience with red tape. All of us who have dealt with pulling permits and navigating the bureaucracy knew getting wall built was going to be a long haul and were willing to cut Trump some deserved slack.  Look at all the lawsuits.  And now look, lots of the wall is up!She should have kept her mouth shut on this and perhaps as for advice from people who build things who could have told her to be patient.  But she jumped her skis imo and threw Trump under the bus, and as Fuentes rightly notes she is now out pushing the GA senate races for a party who just gave away jobs to high tech.She has outlived her usefulness imo.  And I personally have a hard time listening to any woman let alone one who never had kids.  But that’s always been my thing, for better or worse.  How God made me 😉
