        The problem with the Liberals is that they don’t understand root cause.  Welfare is the best example.  The problem isn’t the poor don’t have money but that they aren’t able to support them selves.  No one really wants to be supported.  We all have a need to care and direct our own lives.  If there was any respect or understanding there would be programs to give jobs, not free food and housing.
