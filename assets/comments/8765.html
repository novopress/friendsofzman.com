        It’s the damsel in distress trope perverted by perverted people. An example: 1. Hilary makes a colossal error re her private email server, 2. She might be indicted, 3. Comey is Bill’s man (check out their history), 4. Bill asks Comey for help (calls in a marker), 5. Comey arranges the meeting with Lynch at which Lynch tells Bill what Hilary should say when the FBI interviews her, 6. Comey clears Hilary. 7. Bill (the rescuer) and Hilary (the rescuee) are both in ecstasy for a few seconds.

        Hillary can engage in illegal activities all day long because she knows – with 100% certainty – that nothing will happen to her; even is she gets “caught.”Her political connections and friends in high places will see to that.She has every right to believe she is above the law, because she IS above the law (in case you have not noticed).And her nefarious, illegal actions have resulted in what?Oh, that’s right; a heartbeat away from becoming president of the USA.Just saw the other day on TV Becky Quick of CNBC interviewing Bill. She was very friendly and cordial to the sexual predator. Made me wonder if Becky would have taken this assignment if she or her sisters or mom  or aunts or her daughters had been raped by Bill.Probably not. But then again, he raped women not near and dear to Becky; so that makes it OK.May God have mercy on the USA.

        May be amateur psychiatry, but it meets the Occam test.  Hillary always struck me as just self aware enough to realize her ambitions and interpersonal capabilities were a severe mismatch.  Enter Bill.  And Bill had little capacity for the messy details of running the grift.  Note that Bill has virtually never used email.  He does, as several people have attested to me personally have a near photographic memory for faces, names and context.  Perfect match.  Had to attend two CGI meetings during the interregnum  between SoS and candidacy and you could see when both were in the room or the cocktail reception line how Bill completely overwhelms her.  Hence keep them apart to keep her looking “Presidential”.  Since Bill is most likely in some sort of end stage heart failure, truly his best utility is to conveniently die.  Who knows when that will be arranged.  Maybe a simple medication dosage “error”.

            Postscript:  Happened to sail close by Epstein’s “Lolita Island” twice this spring.  It is one creepy looking place.  Would not be hard for one of those 14 year olds that never showed up on a flight manifest to simply disappear.

        It’s obvious to everyone but their fawning press that both have very serious health issues.Bill looks like The Picture of Dorian Gray,and without her airbrushing that face would frighten children. Why,with all the wealth they’ve grifted,would she be seeking one of the most stressful jobs on planet Earth? Every President ages visibly in even 4 yrs,she’ll be mummified in one. Death wish? Sandy Berger miss some files they must get? Why not sit back at Chappaqua and leisurely count their loot?

        Somewhere down in her black little heart, she probably yearned to be desired as a woman.  Not so much for the warmies – just for the accomplishment by woman who’d never been desirable and knew it.   Moochelle could be in the same boat.

        Another element to her behavior, I believe, is that she really does not want to be perceived as a “screw up” (just as the rest of us feel the same way about ourselves).  The serial overreaching strikes me as a series of attempts to make the “really big score” in order to obliterate any memories of all the past screw ups.  She may be doing it for herself, or for Bill, or for the rest of us (perhaps all three), but what I see is a person who has never, ever come to terms with herself.  Most of us, sooner or later, look in the mirror and see all those screw ups that we have committed, and say “f-it”, move on, accept that we are a bundle of things that a lot of people don’t like or are uncomfortable with, and don’t worry about it any more (Trump is exhibit “A” of this phenomenon).  It looks to me, whenever I see her, that she is the person still looking for some sort of approval.  Perhaps winning the Presidency will be that “really big score”.  I am going to guess it will be a poisoned chalice instead, as her staggering incompetence, coupled with that need to prove herself, will take her and us to places that she and we do not want to go.The Founding Fathers vested as little power as reasonably possible in the chief executive, in part so the personal psychodramas of those holding the position would have minimal effect on the Republic.  Our cultural ignorance of that arrangement is not serving us well.

            I’m a couple of years’ older than HRC, but she was at Wellesley when I was at my formerly all-women’s institution of higher learning.  I do remember that era pretty well.  It was still a normal occurrence in the late 60s to get married right out of college, but there were a bunch of women (30%?) who had not yet met Mr. Right during their undergraduate years.  So, presto-change-o – – – the Ivy League med/law schools were opening up their doors to women in larger numbers than before.  Guys who were drafted to go to Vietnam or ROTC in college were shunned by these women as potential “baby killers,” of all the darned things, so Wellesley grads of that era could only find a guy worthy of their attentions when they got to grad school, or if attractive enough, at their first job at Time-Life in NYC.Hillary probably spotted Bill on her first day of law school.  As mentioned elsewhere in these posts, he still IS a compelling figure.  He’s had the mojo since he was a kid, the lonely, fatherless child of an alcoholic, w/ a card shark of a mother, acting in appealing ways to get attention.  Like Trump, he is not a drinker, interestingly, or frat boy, like GW Bush, who was President of DEKE at Yale, besides being tapped for Skull &amp; Bones.  In fact, I wager that Bill chose Georgetown b/c 1. it was in D. C. and he could hang out with guys (Daddy-figures?) like AR Senator Fulbright; and 2. b/c Bill knew that he would have a hard time fitting in with East Coast preppies at the traditional WASP Ivy League colleges, and Georgetown was Catholic and did not have football/fraternities then.  (Don’t know if that’s still true.)  No embarrassing questions like “Who’s your Daddy?” which would have really set him back at Yale, compared to guys like Bush.  Most of my husband’s friends at Yale had fathers who had also gone there and they would show up on football weekends with the Moms, Smith College grads in their cute woolen kilts, having driven to The Game from New Canaan in their station wagons!  As an outsider viewing this happy, bucolic tableau, it would have been more than Bill Clinton could have coped with as a young person to be shamed for his sketchy forebears.  I also think it explains the odd friendship he has with the Bush family who have kindly, in a way, accepted him into their family.  I know there are other reasons for their doing this, but still, you can’t fake some things.Bill worked hard at Georgetown and lo and behold, was elected a Rhodes Scholar, no less, making friends while in England w/ American aristocrats like Strobe Talbott (Mead Paper Co family, prepped at Hotchkiss, Yale grad, now head of the Brookings Institution, Soviet spy).  Strobe needs to be studied elsewhere at length, also his late wife, who was a confidante and provided security detail for Hillary.  Remember the name Derek Shearer?On the other hand, Bill (at law school) found nothing about her physically, especially physically — ugh — those legs, to get excited about.  I mean, girls at age 20 something should be at their peak attractiveness, right?  I say she made herself available in important ways, did his homework, took tests for him, ironed his shirts, all the stuff he couldn’t be bothered to do while he was out porking new babes.  He promised her the moon: “Yeah, Hillary Honey, you are the best, of course I’ll help you with your campaign for Senator, President, etc.” down thru the years.  Almost fifty years of this.  All I can hope for is that their health issues finally catch up with them and they collapse like leaky mylar birthday balloons.  Americans will have to finally grow up and admit that the Sixties Are So Over.  Please God.

        People of the Lieis good for understanding serial transgressors.Ignoring the spiritual and metaphysical for the moment and drilling down on the merely behavioral, my experience is that serial transgressors are usually smart (and/or clever) and ambitious. But they have some major deficit that prevents them from being successful (what those deficits might be, I will skip for now).  Sometimes the deficit does not manifest itself until some Peter Principle moment, often early in a career. So they begin exploiting other’s trust through lying and/or some other toxic behavior.  They begin to see returns (wealth, promotion, etc) that in their minds equals success. The behavior is reinforced, and we’re off to the races.

        I always ask Hillary supporters to name one accomplishment of hers. I’m still waiting for an answer.
I think folks might want to reread “Primary Colors” by Joe Klein. At the time, folks were focused on the Bill character. The Hillary character is pretty shady too.

        I think Bill may be in danger of outliving his usefulness to her. If he really does become a liability to her getting back into the white house in the next couple of weeks, I wouldn’t be entirely surprised if poor, sickly Bill ends up not waking up one morning. It would not only take him off of the chess board to use against her, but she could get the sympathy vote as being newly widowed from the “love of her life.”

            “I think Bill may be in danger of outliving his usefulness to her.”
Well, he did say to one of his conquests, “Hillary has eaten more pussy than I have.” (see Huma and perhaps Mills and Yoko Ono)
Usefulness to her? That ship has sailed. There is only one way he is still useful…they stay “married”,  for if either one files for divorce her political life is kaput.
And she can’t have that.

                    The type of “lady” the individual making this claim was probably had several suspects who could have stood stud for her.  Bill probably was p.o.’d cuz he knew he wasn’t the one and didn’t like coming up w/ the $$ for the procedure.  Just guessing here.

        Very interesting post, Z.  I’ve always felt that there was something diabolical about the Clintons’ ability to defy the normal rules of political gravity for the last 50 years, particularly since neither originated in either the old elite (like Bush) or new elite (like Gore) at the time they began their political rise.  I mention diabolical because they’d have had to be just phenomenal at identifying, making and keeping useful connections on their own to ascend so far so fast, yet it’s hard to imagine Hillary as personable or Bill as meticulous.So, your idea of complementary psychopathic personalities with a touch of interpersonal neediness is as good an explanation as I’ve heard.

            Al, you may have hit on something. I’ve often wondered how the Clintons could be so venal for so long and after accumulating so much wealth. It could very well be a deeply ingrained resentment against both the old and the new elite, their betters. Some people from their backgrounds (shabby fake middle class for Bill,  proletariat middle class for Hilary) reach for the stars, others, like them, get revenge but wallow in the mud.

            What is so confounding to me is that Hillary is such a shrew and Bill was pretty smart but both as trailer trash could not even be smart enough to keep their foibles and peccadilloes on the down-low as so many others in the political establishment have done.  They just didn’t seem to give a damn.The the real compounding feature of all this is the complicity of all their business and political associates to join in with these “clowns” and the not so insignificant portion of the public who over the decades (always hovering around 40%) has continued to turn a blind eye to their criminal actions.How does anyone explain their longevity in public life?  Sure Z explains their co-dependence and that makes sense, but even for Hillary who I can’t imagine many people liking much at all, why hasn’t anyone torpedoed her years ago?  Bill’s younger charisma can explain much but Hillary, not at all.  I just don’t get it.  No redeeming character qualities whatsoever.  She truly is irredeemable.

                Look at the LA Times daily tracking poll. Blacks and poor people overwhelmingly support Hillary. This I could understand. They’re looking for a handout. It’s the elite liberal crowd that is the real problem. I see their motive as pure hate. Think of Bill Maher.

        After all, these mandarin’s are the ultimate entitlement class. Entitled to rule over the dirt people. Seems rather obvious because, “At this point what does it matter?” is “Speaking truth to power”, in other words, what does it matter to us if in exercising our power “You have to break a few eggs”, even though those eggs are in truth the deaths of other people utilized in the pursuit of absolute power within the structure of a system of corruption so foul that unaccountability is rank of prestige among the political class.In other words the more experienced and proficient one is among elitist peers at getting away with anything and everything including literal murder, the higher in the peer system, hence more stature and power you obtain among your fellow entitlists.All you have to do is gander at the scope and scale of admiration and the mind blowing lengths the entire media complex go to create a Potemkin society out of whole cloth, the revelations self destructive treason of the cucks, the entire human extinction movement of the left, which for all intents and purposes composes cognitive dissonance worship of the blood soaked felonious crone, when a lick of common sense morality provides you with the understanding you would have to be out of your cotton picking mind to have any admiration for this swamp creature in a pantsuit. And that more than a little cheese has to have fell off your cracker to blind yourself to how truly evil this barren vagina from hell incarnate is.I’d say what we have here is her inner Alynski is larger than life.

        Dunno; what about her getting conned into toppling Qaddafi, or the Watergate prosecutor who fired her (without references) for being incompetent and unethical? Even then, by the way, she had a compulsion to steal and hide documents — and get caught.

            Problem is, Doug, that girlz, most of them anyway, always are on the lookout for boyz, you know, b/c they wanna have fun;-)  Thank goodness, silliness will never go out of style.  It’s subversive to whatever power structure is in place, whether it’s the Middle School Principal or the US Military.  I practice it as often as possible.  Also, 80 yo girlz still want to be with men.  I saw this at my mother’s all-girl nursing home some years’ ago.  Hearing a male voice in the corridor caused the old gals to float up from their Barcaloungers and vamp over to the doorways, hoping for a male caller.  I’m talking about the Alzheimer’s wing here.  When I read to Sixth Graders at a public school near us, the book chosen will be one that the boys want to hear; the girls are cool with that.  The other way around, the boys lose interest and start “getting in trouble.”  Our son had a horrid old bat Third Grade teacher who hated boys and did some lasting damage to their psyche.  This was at a top private school.  You really have to watch what’s going on and nip these situations in the bud.

        She also must enjoy both the public and private humiliation of Buba’s nonstop whoring.  And she seems to like the Tammy Wynette “Stand by Your Man” act she has had to pull time and time again.  No wonder she and Huma are friends and rumored lovers, as they both relish having husbands who sexually humiliate them in public with their infidelities, yet continue to remain with them – although it seems that Huma has finally had enough.

Or that Hillary Clinton is resposiblefor ISIS.This Youtube video shows with Hillary Clinton’s own words her true nature and intention and whatshe has already done.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agBtEEYTaYThis is FOX news telling of Wiki leaks that mainstream news will not tell you.  Are interested in thetruth?  This is real tv news telling you the truth.  Also, it has Michelle Obama belittling Hillary, yet recently she was praising Hillary.  So, Why has M. Obama become deceitful. (It’s on the video)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agBtEEYTaYCan you watch these videos and honestly still want to vote for Hillary????It’s true, Donald Trump is “off the wall” sometimes, but do you really think he waited until he wason an elvator to suddenly pounce on a woman.  He owns the elevator.  Why wait?  He owns the buildings.  He could take a woman anywhere and do these things.These stories don’t make sense, and they are misdirecting the American people from what is really important:  Their future.
