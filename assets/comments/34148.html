        It would at least show some consistency if there were “core principles” to be defended.
But the turn-on-a-dime ridiculousness of “I must have a Tesla to save the planet” to “I will now buy a gas guzzler to tell everyone “I hate Elon Musk more than I love Earth” showed how hollow their commitment to Gaia worship always was.
We’re talking half a century of preaching/indoctrination demanding we must do X to save Y being thrown out in a couple of weeks.
There is no living with these people.

            The point for them is control and not logic. They believe in nothing other than their will to power.

                That’s right.
Their fundamental goal is to force YOU to live what THEY preach.
They could care less about living what they preach, which is why they are immune to charges of hypocrisy.

                    They partied while they locked others down. Confirming to themselves that they really ARE Special.
Only one way to deal with this mentality.

                    “They could care less about living what they preach, which is why they are immune to charges of hypocrisy.”﻿Which is exactly why the “non-proliferation” types clutching their pearls about Iran getting the bomb are silent about Israel violating the NPT.I read a fair bit about nuclear deterrence in the 1980s and 1990s as a student. Initially I bought into the non-proliferation stuff, but over time I saw that it was all bullshit. The American foreign policy establishment has been beating the war drums about attacking Iran’s “nuclear program” for overtwenty years— but Iran still doesn’t have the bomb. Before that they were shrieking about Libya and Iraq getting the bomb. They weren’t even close.Meanwhile, Pakistan and North Korea got it… and nothing happened.The nuclear proliferation scare tactics are just another version of “we must attack _____ (Iraq, Libya, Syria… fill in the blank) because chemical weapons” which proved to be a lie.The entire non-proliferation regime exists only to maintain the hegemony of the Global American Empire/ZOG and that’s it. Period.

                        Reductio ad absurdumis useful to see potential weaknesses in an argument. Given Swalwell’s statement about nuking red states if they won’t give up their guns, would you think the world would be better off if Swalwell were a nuclear power? Zelensky? Antifa?

                    You don’t.  What you do is continually point out the contradictions, the failed predictions, the violence, etc to everyone else.I regularly tell people to enjoy their cheap eggs, for example.  The crazies fly off the handle.  Rational people laugh and understand.  Same with climate change.  Like the UFO cults predicting the end of the world, we were supposed to have died 1,000 times from climate change by now.  I just like pointing that stuff out.But you have to be thoughtful about it.  Like warning signs on the trail to the waterfall.  Small reminders along the way, especially hilarious ones, help the next people walking down the trail avoid falling over the cliff.Inflation hit a 4-year low yesterday and jobs reports since Trump came in have been beating “expectations”.  Our goal should be to armor people with the knowledge that every time the enemy speaks, just assume it’s wrong or a lie.

                You see this most obviously with the “Peace movement” which was apparently a complete fraud. The whole point of it was to opposeRepublicansmaking war. So when Reagan took a tough stance against the USSR, the world was going to go up in a mushroom cloud even though the Soviet leadership under Gorbachev was quite reasonable and our negotiators then were not rabid hotheads. When Brandon and his crew of crazed Karens and Neocons took a far more reckless and incendiary stance towards Russia, you were not a real patriot unless you had a Ukraine flag on your car.The psychology of this is interesting and it may be profitable to look more closely at it. There are apparently large number of people whose “beliefs” are actually just whatever they get from one of their equivalents of Pravda’s daily paper. On the other side, you seem to have people who actually do act based on principle and following a premise to a conclusion. Granted, as in the case of Boomer warmongers, their premises are questionable, but it seems to be different modes of thought.

                I used to enjoy crucifying them on the multiple contradictions in their philosophy and watch them go mute when I hammered home point after point.You will never convince these true believers, just as any of you could never convince this Catholic through reason that the Host doesn’t transubstantiate into the literal Body of Christ on the altar.It’s a matter of faith to them that Gaia is angry, that whites are the greatest force of evil on the Earth and that the sweet-sweet butt secks is perfectly natural and good.They are as immune to reason as a barking dog. Treat them that way. The only way to deal with their mental illness is to remove them from the levers of power.Then we can pity the poor wretches, because their life is a literal Hell on Earth and a preview of what awaits them in the next life.

                Acid rain was another. Then there was a fear that deforestation would create a global ice age by making earth’s surface more reflective or suchlike. The loons just career from one apocalyptic paranoia to the next never once considering how their past prophecies of doom failed to transpire.

                    I don’t know, I think what may have happened is that there were serious threats to Earth and humans, caused by humans or that could be solved by humans, but there were smart and innovative people who could solve things and were given support and a chance to, now not so much, evidently. Not really, as now it’s about creating a total control system and maintaining a dominance that’s hanging on by a thread.

            If they ever wonder where they went wrong, choosing eco-televangelist Al Gore was it. The start of the clown show, really. It shows a huge level of unseriousness and spite and ‘joke’s on you’ just as much as a religious televangelist did, and does. Shame on them.

        One of the biggest downstream effects from Christianity is the philosophical worldview that everything must be resolved into a binary and no other options can be considered. This recent push from the right that pollution is good because it’s the opposite of what leftists prefer is a perfect example.One can hold the view that the green movement has gone way too far with environmentalism to the point of inhumanity, and simultaneously think that allowing Globohomocorp to dump their benzene byproducts into the river is a bad thing, and that people who modify their trucks to emit more pollution are douchebags.Most of the readers here are probably old enough to remember when going into a city involved going into a brown cloud, and many of America’s bodies of water had fish that were inedible. I have no desire to return to that world, no matter how much Dupont spends on propaganda marketing because they don’t want to have to pay to dispose of their waste products safely.

                    We once took the Boy Scouts to a remote spot in the desert to clean up a gathering point for IA’s.  We literally filled up a couple of large dump trucks with IA trash.These sites are/were all over.  They are used by IA’s for the final trek into the US—that is to say, their last journey to a pickup point for motorized transportation into cities across the continent.They (IA’s) need to clean up and change clothes so as to be as little recognizable as IA’s from the rest of the Hispanic populace around here.  Everything else brought is then abandoned in this regrouping spot, hence the trash.Another thing I noticed upon my first “cleanup” was the amount of empty medical pill packages scattered about.  I was made aware by others of just what they were—amphetamines!  It was then I knew how these folk could trek 30 miles inland across the desert in 100+ degree heat.The areas were dirty, unsanitary, and dangerous so we never brought along Scouts in future cleanups—willing parents or not.

                    I’ve been arguing something similar lately. If you were truly concerned about our carbon footprint, then you should be anti-immigration. More people living an American standard of living means more water wasted, more chemicals in our ecosystem, more non-renewable natural resources being used, more pollution, etc. You can’t be an environmentalist and be pro-immigration at the same time. You should want as much of the world’s population living in grass huts as possible.

                        If you truly are concerned about carbon foot print, then the logical conclusion is to be anti people.  That or we have to regress to living like its the 1700’s and a lot of people will die on the way to that.  I don’t think we’re out of resources per se, but i do think we’ve used all the cheap ones that allow “growth”.  But if you were to kill say, 7 billion people, well those resources that are now low would last another few hundred years.  They’re stupid.  They don’t see that the thing they support will lead to misery for many.  It’s like being a player and picking up women, the women don’t think of what you’re saying or how you’ll back it up, but it sounds nice.  People will not let you protect them from themselves.

                        Now you get to sell more vaccines!  Why do you think they didn’t require invaders to get the covid jab?  Why was it important you get it, but not people invading the country who they could easily jab?  Why do you get fired and they get free shit?  Create problem, profit from “solution”.
I’m calling them invaders from now on, no more illegal immigrants.

                        That’s a good example of our own “we have to stop doing A (allowing illegal immigration) or B (we’ll all get sick and die from diseases we thought we’d eradicated).”
You’d think we could get some agreement on our B, but for some reason they don’t see it as a problem.

                            So we’re not allowed to bring up actual consequences?  We’re not talking hypothetical consequences that might, at some point in the unknown future happen, but real people sick today!So I guess we cannot point out the rapes and murders because that would be an appeal to consequences as well?Quit being a cuck.

                                My point wasn’t that we can’t or shouldn’t bring up actual consequences, but to show that when we use the same logic or rhetorical strategy as them — which you might hope they would see as an acceptable way to discuss the issues — they simply ignore us or deny the significance of those consequences.
Further proof that it’s no use arguing with these people.

                                        No problem. I could have explained my point better in my original comment.“We need to stop doing A which is causing or will cause B” is a legitimate form of argument. Off the top of my head I can think of at least two equally legitimate ways to respond to it: showing that the alleged causal chain is untrue; or explaining why B is tolerable or perhaps even beneficial (carbon dioxide is good for plants, which provide us with oxygen!).But the Left’s response (if they respond at all) is neither of those. They typically attack the messenger and say that we’re just being paranoid or are committing a slippery slope fallacy. Or that we’re insensitive brutes for not caring about the impact A is having on “unprivileged minorities”. Anything except actually engaging in a discussion of the facts and evidence for a causal relationship.And as Zman says, they absolutely refuse to debate their evaluation of their B’s. Those are taken as a given and shame on you for not having the approved opinion on such matters.

                “…conservation is a very white thing…”I had a Bharati Indian colleague at an American institution decades ago, when the individual was a postdoc physicist, who was unfamiliar with the concept of conservation. This is not a put-down. The man was very smart and perfectly capable of learning. The point is that he did not know. It was not part of his people’s culture, their shared cognition/outlook on reality, and hence not imparted to him during his formal and informal training.Has anything changed in India? Maybe, but I do know this: if those capable of learning are all allowed into the West after their Western training and not sent back to their own countries, who will affect change in their countries? Is useful knowledge seeping back anyone? Spread of ideas doesn’t require movement of people, but it can’t but help.It is the pattern writ large of the Americanized-African talented tenth being drawn away from their communities to enjoy affirmative action gibs while leaving the 90% of the black underclass bereft of leadership moral, economic, political, and social. The white left do this so that they can have token Africans with some cognitive capability around, so they can pretend that everyone is equal. The cost of progressive virtue signaling is suffering for everyone else.

It’s impossible to know the future. But I can’t help but think that a mass repatriation would be the most effective way to spread the best of West Civilization to the world.

                    It ought to be a ‘put down.’  India has nukes and a space program, while most of its people sh*t in the streets and even their  ‘smart ones’ who come to the west have minimal hygiene and are unwilling/unable to adopt classical western values.  Their magic dirt ‘merkin kids have no concept of conservation either.And I don’t share in the concern about AINO siphoning off anyone else’s ‘talented.’  We don’t need them and they should not be allowed here, but my concern is for Whites (in AINO, Europe, and even Canada and Australia, lost though they may be).  I don’t actively wish other nations ill, if they keep their people home and mind their own business, and a White America ought to do the same. I definitely share what the media has termed Vance’s ‘rayciss’view of ‘ordo amoris.’

PS–This assumes the Spiteful Mutants are capable of feeling guilt. I’m not sure they are.

Poppycock. The early Church declared what you claim is a Christian dualistic worldview  a Manichean heresy. Not either/or but both- and saints as dissimilar as Francis from Loyola serve as testimony.

        I once viewed the claim that progressivism is mental illness to be nothing more than political rhetoric. That no longer is my view. The beating heart of progressivism is power and control and the desire to command people to do things they otherwise would not do. This is nothing more than a specie of sadism somewhere along the spectrum. Psychological studies repeatedly have shown people on the Left to be very high on aggression and very low on empathy. Professor Edwar Dutton makes this point often.Progressives have BPD and other personality disorders at very high levels and often are sociopaths. We run down a rathole in trying to understand or interpret their claims or forms of logic and argumentation. The reason they can do a 180 on beliefs is they actually believe in nothing other than power and control. Narcissism, one of the symptoms of the mental illnesses they suffer, compels them to be noticed and obeyed rather than understood. Progressives are sick and therefore need people to be in agony and/or do what they command; it is particularly pleasurable for them to see people in pain as they follow their commands. There is only one way to deal with these types and it is not in the political arena.

Exactly.  Well said.
‘Psychological studies repeatedly have shown people on the Left to be very high on aggression and very low on empathy. Professor Edwar Dutton makes this point often.’
I can recommend Ed Dutton’s ‘Witches, Feminism, and the Fall of the West’. Guess what it’s about? :O)

                At a minimum pre-Wilson was the last time progressivism was a sincere and widespread effort to improve lives rather than to control and dominate. Think William Jennings Bryan era. There are exceptions, of course, but I don’t know enough about Humprey to offer an opinion.

        We have obviously “made a market” for nuclear weapons by regime-changing or wrecking anyone we disliked who lacked them. So our current policy summarized is: “Forswear your nuclear program or be wrecked, and do exactly what we and our pitbull “ally” say, or be wrecked”. We’re pretty lucky that the existing nuclear powers, including the Norks, haven’t given sold bombs to whomever. There’s probably some game-theoretical logic that explains this “luck”, but I will have to think about it more. Meanwhile, I’d feel safer if Iran had a nuke than if Zelensky had one.

            During the Bush years, when the UN International Atomic Energy Agency was under a Muslim director, the number of nuclear nations went from 5 to 15.
AQ Khan, a Pakistani immigrant to Holland, stole the blueprints of the nuclear facility he was working at and went back to sell nuclear plans to as many buyers as he could.
We do know that the Saudis outsourced their nuclear program to Pakistan, the Saudi Bomb(s) was warehoused there to be called in at need.
So sure, Israel is scared of the Muslim Bomb. Till they use it on the West.

        It is all just sophistry. You don’t beat pathological liars, users and subversives with debates and changing the moral framing. In the end remorseless users and liars leave you with a choice; utter ruin or exercising the iron will to rid yourself of them.

        It is always 1979 for some people. Iran, as well as her enemies, know that becoming part of the Biggest Stick Club makes them invasion proof and permanently changes the balance of power in the region. That will stabilize the region. Bagel Land will hate it, but it is quite apparent that they increasingly cannot prevent it.

            The very fact that they have to couch their nuclear development as pursuing “energy independence” proves the Iranians don’t get the game. It makes them easy prey to get caught in the “no, you’re lying and further reinforcing the point that you’re bad for trying to get nukes.” They’ve conceded the A. They should simply come out and say “until we have nukes, we are at the mercy of regional nuclear powers and powers with allies that are nuclear powers. In order to have national sovereignty, we need a deterrent.” It rejects the moral authority from the nosenites to dictate who gets to have nukes.The Middle East’s only Democracy(TM) has caterwauled for decades that Iranians can’t be trusted with nukes because they’re insane terrorist jihadists who do suicide bombings and therefore they’d be fine with doing a “national suicide bombing” by destroying their hated Levantine neighbors. This doesn’t come across well when you know what theSamson Optionis..

                They vehemently deny, while smirking, that they have nuclear weapons and toss the counter-accusation of blood libel at anybody who alleges it. Everybody knows they have nukes, but nobody can definitively say it, as it would immediately lead to unfavorable consequences. For example, under the Symington Amendment, all foreign aid toOur Greatest Ally(TM) is illegal as they have not subjected themselves to the International Atomic Energy Agency despite having nuclear capabilities.

        One thing that’s interesting w.r.t. climate change is that in history, when climate changes, it’s when it cools that you see the worst effects.  For example, when climate began cool in Europe following the establishment of the Roman Empire, food production dropped, diseases proliferated, and population diminished.  Read “The Fate of Rome” by Kyle Harper.  A similar dynamic occurred in 17th century Europe

            The Little Ice Age, which began around 1300 and ended around 1700 (although some climate historians claim that it lasted until about 1850) probably contributed materially to the Black Death of 1348 to 1350, in which it is possible that 1/3 of humanity between India and Iceland died.

                Lying or psychopathy? I always make a point that the United States is infinitely worse demographically than either the UK or continental Europe. That aside, Britain truly is a madhouse now and probably the worst in the West. While I doubt he is sincere, Starmer at least rhetorically is clawing back on immigration and the drones are howling about it and labeling him the Second Coming of You-Know-Who. Dimming the sun is of a piece–racial suicide. There is a genetic defect within white people, particularly those of us of British ancestry, that compels far too many to sacrifice themselves and their prosperity for applause. “Pathological altruism” in insufficient as a description.

        I agree with Z that generally you don’t defeat moral claims with facts but by dismissing the moral claim, preferably by countering with your own moral claim. However, there are times where facts – simply do to their overwhelmingly importance – do intrude, and I suspect that this is one of those times.Spivak claims that Iran’s missile attack a year or so ago was a complete failure and the US and Israel successfully defeated and destroyed Iran’s air defenses recently. Both of these claims are false. Now, often, the narrative makers don’t care about reality, but this time, reality is too big for others – including the Pentagon – not to notice.The US military is in the process of adjusting to the new reality of missile technology and the limitations of our military power. Spivak can moralize all that he wants, but that won’t change the fact that US and Israeli planes and ships are never very vulnerable to Iranian (Russian really) air defenses.My understanding is that any deal with the Iranians that keeps them from getting nukes would include them getting even more very good air defense systems from either China or Russia or both. This would act as a deterrent to any Israeli or US attack, especially given that their current systems already seem too dangerous.This is why Israel wants war now. It knows that the US is a fading power, that ten years from now, it will have zero chance to take on Iran. It’s now or never. People facing hard realities will ignore the moral pleading of people like Spivak.

            There is a strange game of chess going on here. It seems likely that the Iranians provided the Houthis with missiles that could challenge American warplanes. A leak from the Pentagon says the Houthis came close to hitting both the F-35 and the F-18. That could have been a signal to Washington that any attack on Iran will result in downed American warplanes and maybe even a damageed warship.Frankly, my hunch is that Trump has concluded that Netanyahu is insane. His obsession with war certainly suggests it. Logically, a deal with Iran works to the favor of Israel, if Israel wants to make peace with its neighbors. Netanyahu does not want peace, so a deal with Iran is the worst possible outcome for him.

                Yes, it’s quite possible that Iran used the Houthis to send the Pentagon a message.It does seem as though Israel (the world really) is reaching a crossroad. Will it finally accept peace in the region which entails accepting Iran as an equal power or will it try one last roll of the dice to knock out Iran?Netanyahu wants to roll the dice. The Pentagon seems to be saying that it’s already too late. Trump seems to be siding with the Pentagon. The rest of Israel needs to realize that we’re in a new world. Netanyahu definitely doesn’t want anything to do with that new world. He’s a lunatic, but he’s right that he’s better in the old world.

This is the observation that we’re all stuck in 1975 until further notice. Trump is better than most in observing that it’s not, but our global governance can’t get out of this mode.

                Along with those “leaded stories’ we get the hints of a system-wide reevaluation of our military posture. My guess is the Pentagon has watched the Ukraine war with a great deal of concern. it is not just that the wonder weapon is not the determining element, but that wars of the future will once again be defined by the supply chain.We simply do not have what it takes to defeat Iran. We will run out of missiles and maybe even planes before they capitulate and we probably cannot sustain a ground force in the region. We put a half million man army in the field against Saddam. We cannot do that now and Iran is bigger and more powerful and has support from Russia and China.

                    It is questionable if, even at its cold war peak, the GAE military could have conquered Iran (without nukes).Then or now, probably the best the GAE could hope for is bending Iran to its will through some air/missile strikes.Maybe the WW2 military could have done it, but it would have required an Overlord scale deployment.

                        Yep. In the 1990s, it would have been an air campaign plus sanctions – and probably Israel assassinating some generals and leaders – to cripple Iran. Today, Iran can shoot back. They also now have the BRICs to do business with. Finally, their govt is stable enough to deal with Israeli assassination teams.
The world has moved on. We’re now starting to realize it.

                    Exactly. We can’t fight a prolonged war with anyone. GAE officially became a regional power (RAE) – the most powerful regional power but still a regional power – in 2022. The world is just now waking up to that fact and figuring out how to deal with it.Also, we can’t “rebuild” ourselves into GAE. Our economy is too small. Militarily, we have a multipolar world. Israel needs to accept that. So far, it’s hasn’t, but the fact that a US president and the Pentagon are saying No to Israel is a sign that reality on the ground has overtaken Israel’s political power.

This is a key point missed by far too many.
The GAE industrial base and skilled, motivated workforce just isn’t there any more.
If folks want to see this illustrated in quantitative terms, all they need to do is go look up GAE industrial output in terms of steel, aluminum, and ship tonnage versus what Russia and China are currently producing.
Based on those numbers, it’s pretty laughable that so many honestly believe the US is still, “The Arsenal of Democracy.”

                        True, but that reality isn’t going to change in the future. Indeed, it will become more and more apparent that the US is a regional power with limited sway in the Middle East.
Even if the neocons could convince the next administration to try and bomb Iran, we’d like get a serious punch in the nose. Reality is intruding on the narrative.

                    “wars of the future will once again be defined by the supply chain.”
There it is.  The best strategy at this point is to stop buying major weapons systems and create a development, procurement and fabrication system that can quickly react to whatever the latest drone technology is.  The war winning weapon isn’t an jet, tank or ship, but some kind of unknown tech that can break the drone stalemate.
Until that tech comes into being, it seems the ability to mass produce and deploy drones is more important than any advances in conventional weaponry’s capabilities or numbers.

                The F-16s, yes. But the F-35s. Not likely. You’d need a very long wavelength radar with a gigantic antenna. Just look at the RAF’s radar stations during WWII and you’d get an idea of the size needed to detect one of our low observable aircraft, which are built to deal with X-band radars.That’s how the Serbs shot down an F-117 over Kosovo in the 1990s. They largely got lucky because they had some antiquated radars that had a long enough wavelength to allow them to at least get an idea about a firing solution.More likely, it could’ve been infrared guided, which uses radiation from hot metal such as friction on leading edges and the engine exhaust. Since the Houthis have no air force, it is likely not an infrared search and track system. They could’ve shot a few infrared guided surface to air missiles, maybe with an optical tracker, in a “spray and pray” mode hoping for a lucky shot.One theory and I’m not saying this could’ve happened, is that those F-35s were from a carrier. Being on the boat is hard on any aircraft, but especially those with somewhat fragile low-observable coatings. Even the slightest damage could expose them to detection by X-band radars. Whether you could track and illuminate it for a shot by a surface to air missile is unknown.

                    Credible publications have reported the Iranians/Houthis are using L Band COTS radars to obtain azimuth and distance, and then launching missiles with COTS thermal imagers once an aircraft enters the envelope. These missiles are command guided and stare upwards in a narrow cone but once a target is locked it’s very difficult for a pilot or drone operator to know the aircraft has been targeted. Only when inbound is identified, if, can the aircraft take evasive action. So, heat seeking wavelength emitted by the aerobody, and not UV/infrared. Guidance just centers on the periphery until a proximity sensor sets off the warhead. A pilot/operator won’t receive warning until too late given the missile may be coasting and thus no plume. It’s a clever arrangement if true.

            The war party reports that Iran’s air defenses were destroyed so it is now vulnerable to an easy Isreali-US attack. It would be a cakewalk to destroy their nuke sites. Yet Iran has so many missiles that it is able to supply the Houthis with air defense missiles to threaten the best planes the US has. Both cannot be true.
Russia’s failure to achieve air dominace suggests that air defenses may be superior to air attacks by planes.

                The war party can say what it wants. The Pentagon knows the truth, and when you’re facing a humiliating – Suez level – defeat, you tell the narrative spinners to pound sand.
This is the US pulling back. The world has changed. No amount of Jewish spin will change this. Israel needs to come to grips with the fact that the US is no longer the global superpower that can hit anyone, anytime.

                    This is probably why Netanyahu initiated the greater Israel push when he did.  The U.S. is getting weaker every day.  As has been noted here already we have no industrial capacity to carry on a real war with Iran.
It was now or never for the greater Israel project.  However that project is proceeding with much  success.   Can it be sustained to conclusion is another matter.

                        Yes, Netanyahu understands that this is Israel’s last chance. Bomb Iran and regime change it so it falls into disarray for the next 20 years. That’s his hope. It won’t work.

                        That split is also ideological. Leftist Nosenbergs are less inclined to worship Isreal. The farther right you go with that clan, however, the more they’re willing to incinerate the planet on Israel’s behalf. This is all racial, BTW. Leftists hate whites and see Israel as an imperial outpost of the West. Move rightward and the genocidal hatred of the Blue-Eyed Ice Devil diminishes.

                        American Jews still want Israel to do well, even take over Gaza, but it’s not a life or death thing for them. They can see that it’s not going to happen, so why waste ammo on the project. Pull back and wait for a better day.
However, many American Jews do understand as well that the US is a receding power. Their toy can’t do what it used to do.

                Truth, but I suspect Russia’s real reason for not bothering with air superiority is why bother? Artillery shells are cheaper than bombs, and while bombs (and even stand-off air to ground missiles) put a plane at risk, artillery is pretty safe from anything but counter-battery. Which is not a realistic threat from a defanged Ukraine.

            You can’t win period.  I know a girl around my age.  Her mom got knocked up at 16, the guy was a loser and bounced.  Then went on to knock up another women.  You can not convince her that her mother had done anything wrong.  And her family has been living off .gov support of some form for her entire life.  She’s entitled to it, she thinks being poor is a sacrifice that she can do nothing about, never looking at the choices that have been made thru out her life.  I think the majority of Americans are like that.  Another example, was living in an apartment, the women landlord was the sleaziest i’ve ever had.  Was giving me a hard time during covid with lease renewal.  Ask the girl who lived above me to see hers, the rent seemed high, asked her if that was correct.  She says no, but the landlord wanted it stated higher so any prospective buyers of the property would think it made more money then it did.  Ask her if she was the prospective buyer, how would she like that being done to her?  She said “i never thought of it that way”.  Those are the people you are dealing with.

        “American progressivism in its current form can be summarized”
should we call it a feature of American progressivism or of propaganda media? US media has been running into propaganda mode for a century and it gets paid heavily to say various kinds of “B happens”. Hence the distorted stories follow irrespective of how incredulous they are.

            The media, which is nothing more than an arm of the leftist philosophy, continually phrases things in moral terms. The best example of this is the “Donald Trump is Hitler (or at the very least Mussolini)” public meme. The conditional parentheses are meant to be a catch-all, redefining the moral hazard just in case Trump doesn’t turn out to bequiteas bad as the worst case. With the second term of the Trump administration, weariness set in as they cried Wolf one too many times. Now the moralists resign themselves to muted mutterings, their tongues firmly in cheek.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

        Good point about hell. It just goes to show there is such a lack of mature thinking and conversation. If I say all non whites should be removed from North America, and I’m rightly called a racist, and a racist is like totally the worse thing i could be, but so what?i suppose the only real thing progs believe in is hurting another. And racism hurts another. And if you hurt another than it’s the golden rule thing? They could hurt you and we are all hurting each other and society breaks down? I mean, there is no real hell for these people, so it must be that it’s mad max as the end?the Gaia thing is different in that it says you shouldn’t hurt the earth because it’s wrong in itself and thus your soul will be damaged, but then so what? Or it’s wrong because it will hurt somebody and we are back to the mad max thing.the only thing a non afterlife believing people can threaten is social isolation and thus a bad end for this short life. Again so what? If you’re going to die and there is no hell, well…hehe, have at it, baby!

                Most racism is hurty words, occasional sound public policy, or snobs keeping their country clubs from less than ideal behaviors*. In other words, it’s really nothing in the whole scheme of things.A Southern jury and later private men melted out justice on behalf of an Irish Catholic immigrant girl while refusing to convict the black janitor. They were rewarded with the foundation of ADL. I’m sorry, racism at it’s “peak” just wasn’t that bad. Our modern thoughts about racism are entirely about a lack of real virtue.*I wouldn’t make the cut either, so it’s also not entirely about race.

        We are seeing a variation of this construction dozens of times a day from the mainstream media. They will also never change B. New York City was supposed to be underwater 20 years ago and 10 years ago. The core premise is unchanged because Gaia is still angry. Likewise, today, we saw the fake stat that inflation is lower than expected (I say it’s fake because they’re all fake). The media dutifully reported on it, but maintained that the god of the Economy is upset because of Trump’s tariffs and the price pressures are “building” instead of being here as they said it would be. If inflation was higher than expected they would still say the god of the Economy is upset. Nothing changes. We are also now being told that we are all going to die of cancer because Trump is cutting funding to leftist colleges with $50B+ of endowments and nobody is going to do any research.This gives lie to the whole premise of the Enlightenment. Old news, I know, but facts and reason are ultimately secondary. What matters is power. The people with power decide on what B. You need the power to decide that.

            It bares mention again at this point, that much of the conversation so far excludes the obvious, which is that Climate Change models do *not* take into effect human amelioration of the predicted environment impact.  To which an excellent book was published years ago by Bjorn Lomborg:False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet.This book is a half dozen years old now, but still a good read as it speaks of how much of Climate Change—if true—can and *will* be ameliorated through technology at a much lower cost than (questionable) prevention adaptations cost now.  Again, not really a book that one can recommend to change true believers opinion on CC since it doesn’t gin up emotion.  But for the rest of us a good read.

        I’ve been thinking for years that Iran would be well served by testing a bomb.  It is one of the few things they can do to assure the continuation of their government and to protect their people.But, AFAIK, the supreme religious leader has claimed nuclear bombs are Harram.  Everyone agrees the gov of Iran has not “decided” to create a bomb.  This proves attacking Iran is not about the bomb.  It’s just Israel first nonsense.  Not just Israel, but the gulf states too.  They don’t like Iran because of religious differences, so they don’t mind if the big Satan kills the Persian snake on Little Satan’s behalf.It is in America’s interest to normalize relations with Iran.  But since nobody important cares about America’s interests, we are pursuing war at our peril.

        “Progressivism is secular Christianity of the Protestant variety…”Hmppffff. Well thanks for explaining the the obvious foolishness of our faiths, Z. But as I’ve said before – I can get crap like this off of every second TED Talk. My favourite was when this rat faced jew came on and explained that in reality, David was the murderous bully, and Goliath was the victim. (Goliath was afflicted with gigantism and an over active thyroid, you see…). 😂👍 The mutt even had groupies… enormous fat land whales that thought the sun shone out of his arse. Do you have groupies too?For me… I’ve never met God. I spent most of my life contemptuous of Christians and Christianity too. But one frozen winter morning out with the dogs, in the blackness of the long winter night… I think I saw his hand move, and I felt His presence. It was enough.Later I met real Christians – the real deal, not the rotters, fakes and gays we see too much of today. I began to study the Bible and it all astonished me. We are programmed from birth NOT to see God.I’m not assuming anything, Z. I know what I saw and felt and I’m totally okay if you dismiss me as a crank or a loon. That’s the other tactic your enemies like to use: “if you don’t think A+B=C…it’s because you’re stupid and/or crazy!!!”God is right under your nose, in plain sight, Z. I used to think the Bible was an errant crock of beans too. Then I began to study it.christians are not the enemies of the dissident. And we are no friends of the progtard. We are under assault by them like everyone else and we’re losing – badly. It’d be nice to have friends among the dissidents but it is what it is I guess.

                Whenever I mention the outrage of the day, my husband simply responds “It’s Satan’s time.”  That covers it.  In the meantime, man proposes and God disposes.  The best we can do is take care of our immediate family and worthy friends.  The rest is beyond our purview . . . and beyond saving.

            Every time I picked up the Bible for myself before I returned to the faith, I saw nothing but angry insanity. Those first 5 books are difficult to read in a modern light.  It took other teachers/resources before I could return to the Bible to see what it says. The Eunuch in Acts 8 needed help to read his Scripture. I’m unashamed to say I needed it too.I believe your experience of God for the what’s worth. But I’ve been online enough to know that what you mean of Scripture study and mine are probably wildly different. I also know that same Scripture insists that we do not know/will not know who the unrepentant rotters are until Last Day. I expect to find sinners in my parish, not saints. Christian only means believing in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, among a few other attributes. It’s not synonymous with “good person”. God willing you’re meeting people on the journey, not the end.Catholic faith does not claim to save any culture/nation-state from destruction or any person who wants to sin from it. At no time would I encourage anything but an honest examination of the faith in an individual pursuit of God. It’s not here to fix temporal problems, although a group pursuit of virtue will tend towards that end. Countries with Catholic cultures have not been immune to the 20th century.That said, it’s pretty obvious that our modern US secular culture in the US is the decay of Protestant culture that came before it. Progressivism has all the optimism that Protestantism used to have before it got to a certain point. That you cannot recommend your denomination (if you have one at all) is about the very real decay of that Protestant framework. There used to be all sorts of real groups who could get together and agree on at least some points of theology. We’re in the era of “non-denominational” Christianity and reading the Bible at home in the formal religion. Work as a sacrament, proving our good works to others, no hesitation about usury/debt, “I can decide this for myself”, and endless activity have drifted into the public secular culture/. That is what that is. It’s not an attack on your relationship with God.

                Well.. that’s all true too. In truth there is nothing new under the sun. Human beings are much the same today as they were 2000 years ago.We have been here before. In first Samuel the jews were ruled by corrupt judges and demanded they be replaced by a King. I’m conflicted: God said the people weren’t at odds with the judges and Samuel – they were at odds with Him. Our speecher that day said it’s virtually the same today… we are ruled by corrupt judges and political shitheels and I am hacked right off with the lot and don’t want to see them replaced – I’dlike to see them fired out of a cannon! HAR HAR HAR! So…am I in rebellion to God too?I was told that the jews wanted a God of their choosing – one that would forgive and forget their particular sins while prosecuting those of their enemies. That is exactly what we’re seeing in Christianity today. And in politics. It’s everywhere.It’s not the protestants and Episcopalians or even the Vatican driving this crap. I believe our Esteemed Blog Host has that the wrong way around; these are merely the conquered territories of the progs, and I personally think they are driven by the devil. Much ado is made about the gay priests preying on the choirboys – and that’s fair…but the truth is pedos go where the hunting is good. They destroyed the Boy Scouts all on their own. The churches fell the same way the universities did. Or the former men’s spaces did.Unlike those others though…when the churches fall they generally empty out and eventually close. I’m surprised that Blumpf didn’t get up and walk out when he got scolded by that creepy lesbian pastor at the church. But you can bet he’ll never place himself in such a position again.The point of all this is – is that we are all in the same boat regardless of your faith and ideology. I think the dissidents and the faithful are allies more than enemies, that we should respect each other and we should proceed that way in dealing with things… but whadda I know?

Noting that the framework of Protestantism decays into secular progressivism is not a condemnation of any particular sincere Protestant, at least when I notice it. I tend to believe that most people noticing the same thing are only noticing high level trends.  It’s more like philosophical exercise about culture than spiritual commentary. It’s not personal at all in that sense. Nor does this particular sincere Catholic think that a mass conversion to Catholicism magically solves everything. Noticing doesn’t necessarily mean that there are easy answers.

                And this is why it is dangerous to just copy off the paper of the smart kid next to you. There are two Greek words in the Bible that are translated as “church”  ,“kyriakon,” means approximately “the house of the Lord”, which does not appear anywhere in the NT, and “ecclesia,” which refers to a body of people assembled in the name of the Lord, and, in other contexts, the governing body of any group. Thing is, though, from context, it is almost always has to be in the sense of, “where two or three are gathered in My name, there am I also.” There are only 2 places in the NT of which I’m aware where “ecclesia” could be used in either sense, so it’s a little ambiguous as to which.

                    I understand the value of having a lot of smart people working on complex problems before me. It’s a point of wisdom deferring to their answers if I can’t (or don’t have time to) solve a problem. I will never be smarter than roomfuls of smarter people than myself working through time who come to the same answer. That’s the humility we all bring to modern science, too.Anyway, I don’t want to get into a full blown discussion of church structure. However, there is plenty of support in the OT and NT for Catholic understanding of the Peterine office, the role of bishops/priests, etc. It’s so much in fact that it would take me at least an article to answer a surmise about two words that have very similar meanings. I don’t have time and I’m not sure that my answer would matter to you anyway. Just know that there is one and others have written it up if you are interested.

                        Absolutely! One only has so much time, and can’t dedicate every waking moment to deriving from first principles. But the same mentality applied to science gave us the reproducibility crisis we face now. Had we somewhere along the line taken the time to compose something like a Summa Theologica for science, this whole Gaia worship thing might not have come to pass.Honestly, I don’t care that much about the Petrine office. You brought it up. I gain no benefit by arguing it, because I don’t think having the right ideas about the Petrine office is essential for salvation. It wasn’t necessary for the robber on the cross next to Him, since today he would be with Him in Paradise. Nor was baptism necessary, evidently. Nor confession, or communion or indulgences or penance. It’s all fluff.John 5:24 and elsewhere pretty clearly suggests that He doesn’t think the papacy is on the final exam, either. Good enough for me.Do the “believes and understands the papacy thing” if you like. I think you have it covered just from the first one. At best maybe you get extra credit or something?

        I have often cited that dictum that we cannot talk or vote our way out of the mess we’re in. But can we educate our way out? IOW, if our citizens could somehow be educated to understand the harmful dynamics of Progressivism, would that knowledge and understanding lead to a remedy? Ideally, if we were a homogeneous population with above average IQ, then probably yes. But we are now far from that ideal. Perhaps a different sort of education and knowledge would be more helpful in resolving this problem. Perhaps we should ask “how” rather than “why.”

But can we educate our way out?No. For adults, at least, education is just formalized talking.Once we have ___’d our way out, then we can possibly indoctrinate the next generation to keep us out, the way they indoctrinated the kids over several generations to get us deeper into this.This, by the way, is why I don’t particularly care about free speech. Free speech is a trap. We saw how quickly they have abandoned it once they got what they want.

Same point we always get to, you can’t reason with the majority of folk.  You can always, however, generate FUD.  In short, you can appeal to emotion.  No sense asking this question over and over.  The answer is always the same.
Leftists know this and do not trouble themselves with other paths to power.  It seems only Whites—and then a smallish number of Whites—seems to repeat this fallacy of appeal to “logic and reason” over and over again.

                Genuine free speech is limited in scope and has a corresponding responsibility. It’s about improving governance, with a duty to use it for that end.Degenerate or blasphemous public speech are not free speech and never were. Modern “free speech” is a way to clean up hedonism into a virtue.

                Free speech and censorship are not mutually exclusive. It’s internally consistent to not punish people for words, but also set restrictions on where those words may be uttered.
Just a a church should not be forced to have trannies come lecture them, a community could have covenants and restrictions that limit various kinds of things to your own house. And if you don’t have a house in said community, hit the road, “Jacqueline”.

        “You do not defeat moral claims with facts, but with the dismissal of those moral claims by challenging the underlying assertions.”
Indeed.  Z-man has given us a 1 hour lecture in Logic 101 in today’s missive.  As clear as any when I was a student taking such, but with current examples taken from the “news”.  Much easier to understand/remember than the old “if A then B” chalkboard outlines.
I used to search out such faculty in statistics when in the major.  Nothing is more enlightening than illustrating use of methods with real life examples.

            it doesn’t matter. It’s an op. They can’t stop talking about this one aspect of the environment that is totally unfalsifiable and built on their crappy models. They say those crappy models tell us that we need to hand over all power big and small to them so they can micromanage our lives and corral us into “15 minute cities” (that of course are sufficiently diverse). At the same time, our waterways are insanely polluted thanks to a bunch of shithole countries and our brains are getting filled up to the brim with microplastics. Then they whine because it might be slightly more expensive to ship plastic junk across the ocean.It’s totally fake and they care about power only.

        ‘Progressivism is secular Christianity of the Protestant variety’Secular Christianity is a contradiction of terms.  Like Feminist Christianity or Reformed Judaism.  Oh wait yeah, God’s really wrong about this stuff, we better Reform him.However, I see the Progs as an amalgam of God-free Christian moralism and pagan regression to the sex-fertility-mother goddess cults that dominated the ancient world.  They imbibe the worst of both systems.Someone like Nancy Pelosi embodies this, for in her soggled noggin she really does believe she and her sistren are ‘the real Christians’ just as they’re certain they represent Our Democracy, goodness, and fluffy angels.‘Heaven is just the assumed destination if we follow the progressive formula’Progressivism is a great delusion permitted by God, likely magnified by God in the spirit of hey you want it, you got it.  The chaff separate themselves, you just got to shake them around a little first.

                The 1880’s is when West started losing their confidence in God. Before that progressivism was just another protestant rival group. We can even see the jump in real time.Bryan Johnson, who started the “Don’t Die” movement was raised as an LDS member. I’m not going to get into the theological weeds here about their classification. I am going to point out that the LDS are one of many groups from America’s “Great Awakening” era and Protestant in origin.Bryan Johnson is 100% progressive in goal and organization. He’s abandoned even the semblance of believing in God but taken the LDS culture with him, including organizing others into groups. Much of Utah that is non/ex-LDS has embraced modern progressivism.And progressivism was never progressive, unfortunately. It was just the hope that fall wasn’t real.

            It’s not hard to see that Progressivism is the logical conclusion of the Protestant point of view It’s just progressed to get rid of that pesky God idea. Some parallels:-Assuming that Heaven is guaranteed with faith alone. Out of all the Catholic teachings, I suspect the insistence that there are no guarantees is the one causes the most chagrin. Move Heaven to a place on earth and we have progressivism. All you must do is believe it and it will happen.-An ironic emphasis on work and salvation through it.  There’s a reason why it’s called the Protestant work ethic. Catholicism makes a vice out of sloth, but the corresponding virtue is diligence. It’s not working at all hours because God wants it that way. There’s a Psalm that even address the vanity of working if God is not behind it.  The Protestant and later Progressive view is that if you build it, it will happen and will be good for everyone involved.-The embrace of corporations/usuary. American Protestant history is littered with rival/utopist groups who act exactly modern corporations. More than one early corporation was founded by Protestant utopists. Steven Jobs sounded much more like a 19th century preacher with a lot of fancy tech. The founder of Target had refused to advertise in newspapers who also advertised liquor. Modern progressivism is in continuity with the founding of Target and Kellog’s desire to foist poor nutrition on people (for money) so they wouldn’t goon. It’s not hard to see the corporate update for racism and the alphabet people virtues.-An emphasis on the individual including development and belief of personal rights of conscience that go well beyond odd ambiguous situations. I can argue against progressivism because I have/believe in an objective truth. Protestantism must start with “my truth and your truth”, which ends in progressivism’s “my truth and your truth”

Are you even trying to discuss this rationally and honestly? Truth is Truth. There is no “my truth/your truth” crap except in the heads of people who simply refuse to think, and, likely, believe that by attacking others, you, yourself are somehow made better.

                    “Are you even trying to discuss this rationally?”The many disagreements inside a category of belief we call Protestantism do not generally create an attempt to eradicate other groups. How do all the groups co-exist in relative peace?  How do people explain to their Baptist children about the Lutherans and Pentecostals down the street? There are roughly two answers: Everyone but this our group is going to Hell, so pray for them. -or-  God loves us both and wants everyone in Heaven. They have some of the truth from the same book, but we some (more) of the truth from the same book. Many Protestant groups are proud of their universalism in that regard.If you are part of the first group, then yes, you have objective truth. Many to  most modern Protestant groups, particularly of any size do not.“ikely, believe that by attacking others, you, yourself are somehow made better.”I’m an active Catholic online. Given what I have received even in the last week, my points hardly count as mild criticism, let alone an attack.

        But as I had begun to say, a flaw is bad only because it is opposed to the nature of the thing in which it is present. It is therefore obvious that the thing whose flaw we condemn has a praiseworthy nature, so much so that we must admit that our very act of condemning flaws constitutes praise of the natures whose flaws we condemn. For since the flaw is opposed to the nature, the more it destroys the integrity of the nature, the worse it is. Therefore, when you condemn a flaw, you are praising the thing whose integrity you miss. And to what does that integrity belong, if not to the nature? For a perfect nature is worthy of praise according to its kind; it deserves no condemnation. Therefore, if you see that something is missing from the perfection of some nature, you call it a flaw. Thus you testify that you are pleased with the nature, for in condemning its imperfection you show that you wish it were perfect.

        I’m much more worried about what Iran might do here if they decide to cause trouble. There are two power sub-stations where I live. Over the last few weeks, all of the foliage out to fifty yards has been cut down, lighting has been installed on the fence lines with the lights facing away and cameras on gimbals are everywhere. This could be simple precautionary steps, or perhaps someone is finally getting serious about the vermin that have prowling around.i know, I know someone here is going to point out that all it takes is someone with basic rifle skills to punch out a transformer from 100 yards away to shut everything down. True, but the fact that someone is taking things a bit more seriously should be of note.

            Electrical, mines, solar, wind generators, trains and planes are indefensible infrastructure. Thermite is relatively easy to make, derailers conveniently printed, divertable water common, and .308 abounds although it ain’t cheap.
Then there’s plethora easily infiltrated military crew served weapons from the various foreign sources such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft launchers and ordnance. Once the borders went unpoliced, the foreign agents flowed in and hid.
We’re overdue IMHO.

I feel on one hand this guy is unnecessarily paranoid. OTOH, if the dems want to actually change the system, you need a good portion of the electorate to have this sort of paranoia to unleash the ferocity needed to change things.

        The big problem I see with Iranian nukes is that the same as the 19th Amendment — once you cross that line, there is no practical way to return to thestatus quo ante.

        What Z describes is a type of supervenience. In this schema the principles of Category A, if altered, necessarily affect the principles of Category B. Thus, whether the BFE chooses to bomb or not to bomb Iran affects Iran’s ability and perhaps willingness to develop nukes, and therefore its supposedly genocidal intentions vis-a-vis the Levantine Finkels.This supervening principle may be probable but is not absolutely certain. Hence, regardless of whatever the Pansified States of America may be able do to Iran will not necessarily have that much effect on Iran. The point being that the BFE is not quite the omnipotent Big Swinging Tallywhacker it once was.

Steve Sailer would argue with you if he wasn’t on Substack looking for subscribers.
(Your point is valid though)
