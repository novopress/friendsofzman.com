        The Democrats and the Rove Republicans have become nothing more than opposite ends of the same steaming turd.  The only difference is whose cronies get to slop at the government trough when THEY are in charge.  Nothing shows that better than the race for governor of Florida this year.  Candidates are sitting Governor Rick Scott for the GOP – who decided to assign Angela Corey to persecute George Zimmerman EVEN AFTER the Sanford police had carefully investigated and determined that Mr. Zimmerman had committed no crime – and “Orange Man” Charlie Crist for the Democrats.  It is worth noting that “Orange Man” is a former governor of Florida.  As a Republican.  And that he was specifically chosen by previous governorJeb!Bush as his replacement at the end of his term.

        I’ve been thinking about this article:http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/09/moe-tucker-conservatives/
I think they might be on to something. It’s pointless to insist on self-reliance, when you have a population accustomed to government assistance. You change the culture, then change the programs.

        “if you accept reality for what it is, the bad guys win”…By which you mean these days whichever party wins the election, the bad guys have won.  I can buy that.  Too often it’s either the DemocRats or the DemocRats Lite.Watched two Congressional candidates from my district being interviewed on TV last night.  For once, the moderator did a nice job of asking tough questions on a wide range of issues and he called out both of them when they avoided giving a direct answer.  On a personal level, I’m sure they are both very nice guys, but it was clear from the Q&amp;A session that neither one has a real clue about policy beyond their party’s talking points.

        Nope. It gets worse every year that goes by when the sucking on Rich Lowry’s   manbit gets wetter.  Really not worth a bucket of warm spit now.

        if NRO seems bad now, it must have been much worse in 2004 at the height of the Bush presidency
