        Same age as Z and a father so I’ve seen it from both perspectives.  Sure I had some crap jobs back in the day.  Then I got my act together and my career on track.  About 15 years ago, noticed it the diversity bunch getting the promotions instead of me or people who look like me.My son has seen that crap his whole life.  He and his friends aren’t bitter about having to work hard.  They are bitter because they know the whole system is rigged against them – while they are expected to keep that system going for the people who hate them.

            Today I see that Walmart is advertising 3,000 H1-B jobs, average wage 139,000….How is it possible that Americans can’t fill those jobs? Many Ivy League grads would apply, as well as recent Business school grads…

                The notion that dot Indians are well equipped for such jobs ignores the fact that India is perhaps the most corrupt society on the planet, and everything is accomplished by bribery….

                Not even Ivy League or business school grads. Walmart, like so many American companies, was built on finding people with potential who were initially hired at the lowest level, training them, and moving them up the corporate ladder. The idea that they need to bring in thousands of Indians is insane considering in prior generations, the people manning those jobs were former cashiers and janitors.

                    Walmart, many years ago, seemed to be given some kind of ‘business success plan’ that included ‘make sure everyone who works there is a moraless zombie who will go along with any abuses we deem to dish out on them”. Take any abuse.

                Don’t forget, companies have diversity quotas to fill to meet their ESG requirements.  My company for example set a goal to be 62% diverse by 2024.  Think about that for a second…. This metric is literally a full on admission that it’s anti white.  How can you be 62% “diverse”?  What does that mean?  It means that if the company was 62% black males that the quota would be met.I can’t wait to get out of corporate America.  I’m trying to hold on until I can retire.  It will be a miracle of if I can make it.There’s a lot I can’t stand about the younger generation, but I also feel really badly for a lot of them.  My first job out of college was for a big company that had a special tech program.  You had to qualify to get into it like most things back then.  I spent 6 months with about 35 college grads.  All of us were White.  Every single one.  They’d never even allow that now.  I remember believing that merit and hard work would take me as far as I was willing to go.  I miss being able to believe in that sort of thing.  For these young people today, especially young men, their prospects are dim and only getting dimmer.  They will live to see Whites become the minority and it will greatly affect them.

                    Every person who still has 15-20 years to go in corporate America or even small company America has it the same.In fact, age discrimination has long been a fact of corporate life. That has long screwed the people who wanted to be excellent at their role but not deal with the headaches, and frankly folly, of being in middle management. Corporate America and most companies because of private equity, broke that promise long ago.Go into any corporate store now in any urban or near urban area. FedEx. UPS. Apple. Kinkos. … … The staff is almost entirely black. At the same time anti-White is moving from the top down as well. This is a pogrom. This is the people who took over this country and vassalized it kicking the White man out of his own society and closing the doors on him.If anything, people who need that 15-20 years are worse off than the youth. This is because you get paid a lot more. Your age makes the health care actuary tables work against you. You are way more productive and carry a lot of knowledge, but that is more than offset by the actuary tables.The youth can work harder and lower their wages. Now, Whites still may not escape. The bottom line is, the anti-White regime is liquidating us. Trump’s election didn’t change that. The places where he paraded himself around in fealty as did Musk and Poliviere and all the rest want more coin squeezed out of you on top of a longstanding blood libel.It isn’t hopeless. But we are going to have to realize that this generational thing is a division we don’t need. We need patrimony. If you are older and have means you are in a position to build it. If you are young work with elders and your peers. We are all in this together. The Regime has made it about race. We have no choice but to respond accordingly.Of course all of this pre-supposes that you are the second class citizen of the GAE – a White man and a White woman who is raising a family with a White man.In addition to patrimony, we need to get sue happy. Just because Zuckerberg put away DIE doesn’t mean anything. Empty words. If the hiring is disproportionate sue for disparate impact. As Sam Dickson said, we are in an alley fight. Act accordingly.

                        Boomers better start leaving an inheritance, no matter how small. They better start giving money however and how much they can to their offspring now up to the legal limit of tax free. No more of this whoreshit of dying broke and spending everything. A real man was dupont who has 3500 descendants sharing somewhere around 14 billion dollars. Not everyone can do that but anything is better than the consumerism pursued now. Until that becomes the prevailing ethos of boomers, no deal.

                            @Jkloi, your terms are acceptable. Or should I say, Mr. Zelenskyy.
My kids have nothing to fear re: inheritance unless government manages to steal it all by then. And they are getting plenty in the meantime. Not only did they graduate without having to get a job, they graduated debt-free.
But they are much better behaved than you. Better work on that attitude. I don’t care what your skills, you are not worth having around. I wouldn’t hire you. You are poison.

                            There are two sides of the entitlement issue, and BOTH are guilty.  Boomers who joke about spending their kids’ inheritance and dying broke are selfishly breaking with thousands of years of tradition and Biblical wisdom (“A good man leaves an inheritance for his children’s children . . .”).  The children/grandchildren with their hands out are DEMANDING money for an often unrealistic lifestyle and offering nothing but derision instead of honor to their parents.

                                I would not take that Boomer cliche at face value.  There is no way Boomers will spend their wealth and rob their children as the cliche goes.  In any event, one gift Boomers can give—and I give—their children is to to live separately and independently such that their children can concentrate upon their own futures rather than take care of their parents.

It’s not going to happen. I resigned myself to seeing that house burn completely to the ground ages ago. Too many Boomers at still a reckless 16 at heart.  They are the epitome of “There’s no fool like an old fool.”

                            I keep on hearing this.  It has been estimated repeatedly that the Boomer generation has between $42T and $62T in wealth to leave to their heirs.  Is that enough for you?  In any event, such an inheritance will not solve the problem.  The problem is that not all millennials are at the same level of competence as their Boomer parents.  Some will obviously exceed, many will not.

Having that money doesn’t mean it will be there for their heirs when they die. When surveyed, they are adamant as a collective that they will be spending money on themselves. Unlike their parents, they do not see it as duty to help or leave anything behind.The issue is not even that they have the lion’s share of the wealth and have no plans to help any other generation. The oldest generation always holds most of the wealth for obvious reasons. The issue is that they hold an abnormal amount of wealth, even as the oldest generation. Not only is one (really two with the Silents) holding onto generational too much of the wealth of society, by every measure they will be taking as much of that money with them as possible. It’s a locust effect on the other generations, like it or not.

                                    That remains to be seen, and I predict won’t be seen.  The economists studying this phenomenon focus on the wealth transfer to heirs, not a frivolous spending of such.  Even if such is more the case than not, what happens to the money?  Do the Boomers take it out to the back yard and burn it?  No.  They spend it and those who provide services get receive it.  Hence job creation and wealth transfer in the present—precisely for those Millennials and Zoomers you claim are being deprived.

                        Tired Citizen: “I’m trying to hold on until I can retire. It will be a miracle of if I can make it.”Reality Rules: In fact, age discrimination has long been a fact of corporate life.I saw the writing on the wall. When I was 54, the company offered buyouts to people over 55. Pretty darn clear message that they didn’t value older employees. I was 54, but going to be 55 in about four months, so I contacted them and asked if they’d give me the 55 buyout. They said yes, and I was done.Now, I’m still below retirement age, but I’m pretty sure it would be impossible for me to land a job in the business unless I could find an old co-worker who was in a sufficient authority position and took pity on me. Fortunately, I have no desire to go back. I’m doing just fine in the post-corporate life.

                    Seems like a plan to make white males say they love anal sex and trannys in order to keep their job if you are a white male.
Saying you love and are an ally of women or black Americans surely doesn’t cut it anymore. They need you to go further. And quietly accept medical experimentation on the populace to boot.
Their asks to keep your job are no joke. They want your soul.

They hate Whites, and they want us dead.
Its much easier to eliminate a whole bunch of people if you “unperson” them.
If whitey doesn’t develop his own societies,(which will be hard), he’s gone anyway.

                    They don’t want you dead physically, so much, though they don’t mind that, but they’d much rather have you be dead in your soul and any evolution and cooperation that happened to make you white, dead. They call it whiteness right? lol They have a fucking name for it.To them it’s nothing personal. It’s evolution and what made you white that is the culprit. How generous of them, isn’t it?Seems to boil all down to the ‘out of Africa’ thing, our ancestors left, we said we’d fight the brutal cold and probably certain death to not have to put up with them anymore, and then we thrived when they said, “they’ll be back, they’ll never make it”.Still mad about it, because of course they are.

            Exactly. The debate isn’t about being humble and working your way up vs lazy youngins. It’s that young whites are told to go to school, work hard and you’ll have a chance for a middle-class life, but when they do that, their employer either hires/promotes the less-qualified black lady or the H1B Indian or immigrant of another flavor.
Both sides of the economic/cultural debate are missing the point.

So round those people up and toss them onto an ice floe. Not an abstract group, those exact people. If you are Christian, you might want to visit that upon the children to the 3rd and 4th generation to make sure you purge the stupid.

            Btw, Lineman is right. High-skilled “blue-collar” (that term is so outdated) jobs are generally immune from both DIE and immigrants. When you have a high-skill job that needs to be done on time and done right, you get the right guy for the job and would never risk some idiot DIE hire or corrupt Indian.

                I don’t know how you can say this anymore about any job. They used to say it about college jobs, and especially in tech, we learned that companies will tolerate an insane amount of incompetence and corruption from the subcontinent if it means not paying Americans. Heck, the first job I think of when I think of “high skilled blue collar job that needs to be done right” I think of somehting like an airplane mechanic, but Boeing and the airlines are all in on DEI, even while the planes are crashing into each other on the runway and the wheels are falling off.

                    Mycale:  I think you and Citizen are both correct.  My husband and I no longer fly for multiple reasons, but DIE (for airline mechanics, pilots, and air traffic controllers) is a big part of it.  Trump will not change any of that.  And my husband recently dealt with the expected incompetence and credentialism while on a business trip (dealing with hotels, banks, etc.).  Where we now live, the bank tellers and county and state employees and utility providers are all White, all capable, and all courteous.  The difference is night and day.﻿But it won’t last another generation between immigration, birth, and death rates.  Majority White communities are becoming extinct and all the non-White numurkans will only hire their own.  And who would want to be a White helot providing reliable electric service to all the pajeets calling themselves murkans?

                    What you say is absolutely true at the corporate level. However, I believe Citizen is correct about the sub-corporate, local and regional levels.

That’s a little too cynical, even for me. They tolerate incompetence because they know the generally conscientious Whites will pick up the slack and fix the mistakes.
I think it’s risk tolerance. When was the last time anyone said, “Take this job and shove it”?

                    Boeing has gone all-in on hiring from the subcontinent, something I’ve heard from friends in the aviation industry (I work for another defense contractor). The problem is India is filled with diploma mills. Our engineering schools have accreditation and most graduates, barring the DEI types, can cut the mustard. The ones over there do not.Since dishonesty is a fundamental part of their culture, they don’t care if they don’t know how to do the job. The consequences of their shitty non-work, which often has be redone by outside contractors at ruinous expense, don’t even phase those amoral, arrogant, parasitic SOBs.My company thankfully has kept what little of this lunacy they participate in the front office and HR, not in engineering where real damage is done.We have our problems, but many of our issues are related to software and a customer who expects the sun, moon and stars without understanding that the perfect is the enemy of the good.Boeing is screwed. They’re already in trouble with the T-7 training aircraft and the KC-46 refueling tanker. Taking a bath on market share against Airbus will destroy that company. They need to clean their ranks of these DEI non-hackers and get back to fundamentals.The shame is Boeing used to build fantastic airplanes and their engineering was second to none. They invented the strategic bomber, commercial airliner and the tanker aircraft.Then the suits decided they wanted to cut costs to increase profits and now have forever ruined that reputation. It also doesn’t help that they build a plant in South Carolina where half of the workforce is black and shows up higher than an SR-71 on a recon hop.

            Step one is to work hard and to work smart. Step two is to get rid of this inter-generational stereotyping and rivalry garbage. It is one more brother war Whites do not need. Gen Xers who played by the rules are in big trouble as much as the younger generation. They are already a smaller age cohort and becoming managed by millenials, many of whom perpetuated Gamergate, and the smashing nihilism of the aughts and ’10s. They wanted to get ahead immediately. How? Bash the white man. And they did it.The point is, we, White people, Americans, don’t need any unnecessary rivalries and barriers in an increasingly hostile and increasingly anti-White world. “Woke” may be getting put away, but in reality it isn’t. Rufo got his scalps but look around every University in America. The Phd programs are colonized and it is getting worse. The scholarship programs and inclusion programs are not going away. He got his sinecure with his symbolic victories, (Claudine Gay is not president but she still has her $900K annual salary).We are on our own. This is a great post. Our task is to form a White patrimony system. Just like the other tribes outwardly play by the proposition when it suits them and the real rules behind a smile as it always does so must we.This is to Z’s point about operating in a system in which they were not raised to navigate. If we do the proper thing, then in 30 years we’ll have a nice little patrimony system and things will be okay if we can balkanize without mass third-world dump offs. That is the key now. Will The Regime continue to ship in hoards to every potential redoubt. If so, then there will be no peaceful way out. If not, then it will be hard but not as hard.In short, White patrimony on the down low is on the docket. Trump has and will betray on immigration. The Regime is hardening and they need GDP. They will do human quantitative easing no matter what. We must force someone’s hand on freedom of association and eliminating Civil Rights or forcing it to be applied to Whites. Be willing to sue. Running is no longer an option.

                Great point about the inter-generational rivalry.  I was thinking about this situation and the H1b situation on twitter and how much more engaged I was with the H1b discourse.  This is just more infighting, meant to further divide us among generational lines.  It’s counterproductive other than revealing those who have no interest in helping young White men succeed in this country.  During the H1b floggings, everyone was on the same page, pulling in the same direction for the same cause.It took me 5 years after graduating college in 2009 to get a full time job in something tangentially related to my degree so I’m obviously sympathetic to what the kids are going through these days.

            Same. The rational response is to detach from the system to the greatest extent possible. I do see some very remarkable young whites doing so by entering the trades and opening small businesses. They first did this by refusing to degrade and debase themselves with military service and that removal from the rot has spread to most other areas of the system.

            Yup.  Young men — especially young white men — are expected to strive and fight for a system that openly loathes them, gleefully discriminates against them, and then calls it all progress and justice and righteousness.
Ain’t gonna end well.

                        Wrong, except in an English grammar books. However this is not English 101. This is reality. Every other race has their race adjective capitalized. If Blacks can do it, then so must Whites. And anyway, Whites as I’ve used it in a proper noun. It signifies a particular group, not a color.

        This topic feels like a doom spiral – on the one hand you have the broken promises that the older generations made to the young, and the betrayal as they chose foreigners and brown people over their own. On the other hand, young people are intensely self-absorbed and have a totally unrealistic vision of life, driven by social media’s focus on material excess. Of course, they didn’t invent social media, so I don’t even blame them for this. That said, I see so much whining on social media from the few zoomers who actuallydidmanage to get good jobs after college in their field, the lucky few for which the system worked. They want faster promotions, they want more recognition, they want the boss to listen to them on how to run the business. If they don’t get their way they do “quiet quitting” or something like that. Not for nothing most of this whining is from women.Remember when Bloomberg came out with that article a couple years ago stating that 94% of jobs in Fortune 500 companies were going to “POC”? The outrage and uproar was so total that some people tried to claim the math was wrong. Of course the math wasn’t wrong and we are going to see more and more of these companies turn into the LA city government as a result. It’s a doom spiral.

            Private concerns will crash and fail right along with the public sector given these trends, yes. This actually started a decade or so back with a few former Blue Chip corps, and this is on the horizon for GE and so forth. Some like Boeing have tried to pull back but it very likely is too late for them to do so.

            I worried about this exact outcome when most of my age-group’s young professionals took their first job, then immediately contacted the headhunters. Yes, it resulted in double the salary in a few years, but at the cost that no company could trust that their hires were using them as anything other than stepping stones. Training is expensive, and you are not contributing very much those first few years. And once you start producing more than you cost, you jump ship. There was no longer any company loyalty, but it wasn’t the companies reneging on the deal.

                The companies have been reneging on the deal since importing infinity Indians and pension plans went the way of the Do-do bird. They were firing long term hires when I was young for “cost savings”.Pension plans, from the POV of a corporation, were ways to depress wages and increase employee retention. Ditto to health care benefits to an extent. Then however those two issues merged and people actually were collecting their pension benefits for a fairly long time. So pensions were dropped because they were too expensive.For some reason however, corporations seem to expect that people will be there forever for peanuts and be thrown out on the street when inconvenient too.

                    You need to look at what really happened to the pension plans. They got taken over by union gangsters and political chicanery. The tail end was looting by the corporate raiders, enabled by those corrupt politicians.
If you won’t bother to read history, take an hour and a half to see “Other People’s Money”. It’s pretty close to the truth.

                    Oh, and health benefits and most of the pension mess was not from corporate green eye shades. They were responding to FDR’s rules preventing wages from rising because it would decrease military enlistments.

                        “They were responding to FDR’s rules preventing wages from rising because it would decrease military enlistments.” I recall there being a draft, so that’s not the reason. FDR’s era was the US’s brush with communism/social engineering lite. FDR’s administration had implemented price controls before the war and was no stranger to them after the start of it. Pensions and health care benefits allowed corporations to keep wages depressed, which was my point.

Nice fable, but not true. Companies wanted to keep their best and brightest rather than have them signing up to go get killed, and definitely did not want Messicans or Rosies taking those jobs, so came up with the idea of benefits as a way of skirting the wage controls.
Same exact thing caused stock options. It’s like history repeats itself or something.

        I feel like I’m part of the first generation that can reasonably argue that today’s kids have it worse than we did when we were their age. My teen years were in the 1990s. Sure, maybe the economic situation is slightly cushier at present, yet the culture has degenerated into absolute dreck and immiseration. There was a noticeable amount of anti-White propaganda when I was a youth, but not nearly to the degree and level of ferocity that it has reached in the last decade or so. Education/academia and media have basically done everything in their power to alienate young White people from their natural in-group. Plus, my generation didn’t have to deal with any of the transgender lunacy that now attacks folks in their most vulnerable years. Though the 90s were no utopia, they look like a damn golden age compared to now. I have nothing short of immense sympathy for the young people who faultlessly inherit this corrupt clown show of a culture. The so-called adults have royally f***ed things up for these kids!

                I once heard it put by Woe of Stone Choir on twitter that arguing with the average boomer is like yelling instructions to the coach on TV while watching sports. It doesn’t matter what you say and they’re not listening. A lot of what passes for “discourse” among that cohort is repeating platitudes and talking points they got from whichever cable news talk show they watch and smugly waiting for everybody else to nod and smile. Of course political discourse in the younger generations is largely memetic, but at least the memes originate from the bottom rather than getting handed down from talking points memos.

They largely get it within their generation. Thus the political discourse is a disagreement largely over implementation and scope of goals they all agree on. They have had political influence since the mid 1980’s and cultural since the late 1960’s. They literally don’t know anything else besides what feels like universal agreement/”unity” and rooting for their politics as if were a sportsball team.

                It is jaw-dropping. Listen to conservatards on talk radio these days. The best-case scenario for them is that they are blatant liars. If they are not, the degree of delusion will prove fatal, which actually is happening. Boomercon fantasy actually makes me angrier than leftwing anti-white hatred.

                Why do this?  Why group Whites with north Asians?  WHY?  We and they are not the same people.  We don’t share genetics (unless you are one of the guys with yellow fever and hapa kids) or culture.  I wish the Koreans in Korea well but they are not my people.

                    Modern Europeans, especially English descent, are forever looking around for friends for some reason. I suspect it’s because the English don’t parent all that well as a group, at least the modern ones.

                            I am an American with an off the boat English grandfather. I have seen the English family sausage being made. The English are not outstanding parents, at least in the 20th century in North America. By personal observation, their children are somewhat spoiled, angry, and resentful. It’s not surprise that if they had money they might try to “adopt” even if unconsciously more pleasant and attentive ones.

        Our kids are not lazy. They aren’t stupid.They’re KIDS. They’re supposed to be assholes, foolish, and unfocused.It is our JOBS as parents to deal with that. Not only our own, but everyone else’s kids too. It’s called COMMUNITY. We can’t even hold our families together and most of our women NEVER grew up. Our schools are run by lunatics, perverts and turd brained vibrants.Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis and Butthead – took a lot of heat for sending the wrong message to kids with the cartoon which featured two retarded antisocial kids trying to deal with the world and failing miserably. Mr. Judge responded that the cartoon was a message to the adults – and it was, paraphrasing, “Take a long, hard look at YOUR kids, America… because Beavis and Butthead are what you’re going to get if you don’t…”Those kids today are no different from you or I. They didn’t magically all become failures. Without a home and community they cannot succeed. We are going to reap what we have sewn.

            Yes, we need to be honest about the state of the young workforce.  People who have no experience managing lower class workers have very little understanding of how difficult it is to keep them functional.  I have a friend who previously worked as a fast food regional manager. I asked him how difficult it was to keep the restaurants staffed. He said unemployment is 4% and 5% of people are on drugs.  Their goal was 100% turnover annually. This was before widespread legal pot, which makes this problem even worse.

            I wish I could upvote your post more. Yes, absolutely kids are kids. They are going to want to take the easy way out. Everyone needs to be patient with that. We are failing them.“We can’t even hold our families together and most of our women NEVER grew up. “We can’t hold our families together because what women do is now something that doesn’t matter. Childbearing, all of it, including dealing with small children 24/7 is how women grow up. Now they are supposed be off taking all the jobs that men need to support their families, so they can grow up too.

                Well that brings up another crippling social problem… taking the easy way out is what gave us the education scam. The kids have a grump father at home telling them to put in the time, do the work, and take a meaningful program when they graduate. On the other hand they have ‘school recruiters’ telling them they can party their way to a degree in kitten studies and then look forward to a six figure income.I had that fight in my family and lost it. I’ve since come to the conclusion that young women should not go to university at all unless it’s for something like nursing or one of the few “practical” programs in the humanities.

                    Almost no one should go to college unless it’s for a practical course of study. The exceptions are the trust fund babies where it makes absolutely no difference —  granddad’s finance guys will handle everything, and you can go flash your beaver getting out of a sports car, like Paris Hilton.

                    Here we go again, college vow non-college—when the question is basically, “Are you fit for college?”.Any number of articles recently published now estimate that the typical college student has an IQ of approximately 102!  That’s simply average.  Is that what college is for, or was that what HS was for Boomers?  Now if you are of average intellect, why do you expect employers to treat you like a rare and profitable commodity—especially when you’ve majored in a weak or faux discipline.  Majors in grievance studies or basket weaving have no useful job skills, hence no market value.Unfortunately we’ve sold a college degree to the average HS graduate as their “golden ticket”.  Thus producing a generation of (faux) elites who think upon graduation they should enter 6 figure jobs.

            Seconded.  Absolutely correct.The past half-century, the nation has not merely turned away from white men, but turned ON them.  With shouts of conquest and glee!Boys and young white men should use the rejection and disenfranchisement by the culture as an opportunity to connect with Father.  Turn away from this evil nation and back to a Source who will NOT betray you and stab you in the back.My generation of men still hewed to the Romantic Tradition, and put their faith in women.  Listen to popular music of the Fifties and Sixties if you imagine otherwise.  And those men got stomped for their silly naivete and spiritual ignorance.  They should learn to put their faith in God instead of a world ruled by the enemies of God.

                ” Listen to popular music of the Fifties and Sixties if you imagine otherwise”
There was a lot of creepy music in the 1950’s and 1960’s. “Hey Baby, It’s Cold Outside” is from that era. CS Lewis observes of the generations near to him that they seemed to be sex starved. Any romantic tradition from then was busy covering over many issues of sexual immorality.

                ray:The past half-century, the nation has not merely turned away from white men, but turned ON them.
That’s because the j00z fear moral &amp; sane &amp; sober White Men more than all other hominids on this earth put together.
Moral &amp; sane &amp; sober White men put the fear of God into the empty soulless vacuum which is the j00.

                    EM Jones has a whole book about the idea that lack of sexual mores makes slaves of the population. I absolutely agree with that. Part of our inability to deal with the Alphabet people involves having more than one generation of men that has been very undisciplined in that department.

        Merely for perspective, I’ve hired a number of people with their master’s degrees in the past near 10 years. It’s remarkable how little they know in their fields. Often it’s been almost nothing. They also demand raises and salaries that are so out of whack with reality… and when they get a healthy raise on a healthy salary, they demand more immediately. They struggle to understand how a non-mega-corp might not be rolling in millions.You also literally have to reprogram them from the ground up, even to think critically. We’re talking about folks in their 30s too not their late teens. Even when they’re relatively well-off, they cannot stop spending on the most trivial shit, boat loads of it. They’ll complain about student loans when they inherite a house… and still struggle to pay their bills on $150k in low-cost, low-tax states without that mortgage.They KNOW they can weaponize these complaints of student loans. Don’t think they won’t exploit you just like anyone else. They do not give a fuck about you (as a fellow co-worker, partner, etc) or the business. Lastly, semi-related, I’ve walked into several business staffed with 25-35s yo since covid, and no one – and I mean NO ONE – is EVER doing anything but playing on social media.

            Great comment.
I’d only add there is a vestigal percentage of folks of all ages that still spend their days at work, “walking for dollars.”
Edit: The trouble with most Masters and many Bachelors programs is that they are far too theoretical in nature.
That means those grads will only tend to be effective in academic research roles.
There isn’t much place for them in industry because serious corporate research is extremely rare these days.

            The Masters degree creates a whole another level of elevated expectations, especially if they haven’t done any meaningful work yet.  These programs exist to generate revenue for the schools not produce a needed workforce well trained to perform vital functions.  The government needs to step in and end most of them.

The government doesn’t need to do anything.  Stop subsudizing student loans and higher ed.  Let loans be discharged via bankruptcy.  This isn’t rocket science, i don’t worship the market, but if you let it work it generally does what needs to be done.

        “Those over the age of fifty love telling stories about the terrible jobs they had as young people, while no one under the age of thirty complains about not having had crappy jobs to make ends meet. In fact, the main complaint from college graduates in their twenties is that they have crappy jobs.”Those crud jobs that prior generations had available after getting their high school diploma now frequently require a 4-year degree, and those college graduates taking those no-hope dead-end jobs often have the weight of student debt of $100,000 (or more) weighing them down. Furthermore employment is more precarious today than it was in 1990, which was more precarious than in 1960. Furthermore big-ticket items like houses have moved well beyond reach, making family formation has become difficult. That 20-something incel college graduate working as a coffee shop barista and living in his parents’ basement is not going to get married and have offspring.I think “peak USA” was around 1959 and peak US wages around 1971. Those baby-boomers talking about how hard they had it are talking bollocks (and I happen to be a baby-boomer myself).

            Just with regards to economics, the big miss for millennials and zoomers is the gap between their pay and productivity and the relative cost of housing. That includes rents. When I left high school, the rule was your mortgage or rent should equal one week take home pay. The typical mortgage payment now is two weeks gross. Rents in and around major cities are similar.The rent side is driven my immigration and the precipitation of entry level home buyers, who are priced out of the market. That last bit is getting worse as baby boomers downsize. They go into that entry level market with cash and not concerned with price. They sold their big house and now have cash that they either plow into the house or pay cap gains on come tax time.

                My freinds in the building industry say that we need millions of starter homes ($200,000-$400,000 depending on location) but the land costs are too high to build homes in that price range.  So they are building town homes.  A lot of baby boomers are not downsizing as its cheaper to stay in their homes than move.  So folks looking to move up can’t.  This also crimps starter home supplies and increases prices.  Immigration also increases demand and prices.

                    How many of those starter homes would actually be for the shrinking number of Whites?  Most people here still seem stuck on the fantasy that AINO is still 60-70% European White, when the reality is barely 50%.  And east and south Asians often live in multigenerational homes – often the same size White would consider comfortable for one nuclear family.  And they combine financial resources to buy them.  Whites have no chance these days.

                “When I left high school, the rule was your mortgage or rent should equal one week take home pay. The typical mortgage payment now is two weeks gross.”
When I bought my first home, the rule was rent up to 40% of take home, because it was something you could leave on short notice, but a hard cap of 28% for a mortgage. That was Minneapolis.
Where you lived must have had a lower cost of living. Unless you wanted to live in a boarding house, there were no rentals available for 1 week’s take home.

        The most dismaying aspect of this latest dust-up has been watching X’ers and, even more remarkably, Millennials, who have gone from correctly blasting Boomers over their detachment from reality to kicking the shit out of Zoomers over legitimate economic complaints. The hypocrisy and mindlessness are jarring.Teenage jobs of yore did suck but they at least prepared young people for the workplace in seemingly insignificant but actually vital ways such as punctuality. Those jobs to the extent they even exist any longer largely go to Jose and Raj; Shanika never did them in the first place. Where the real cruelty manifests is with what confronts young whites when they graduate college. They face very blatant discrimination for little is there for them. This has helped to radicalize them, which is good long term but in the interim means needless suffering. We need young whites both as professionals and in the trades, but given the current realties a young man should seriously give the latter a hard look.

            For better or worse, boomers are leaving the picture. At some point, kicking them around isn’t helpful. The youngest boomers are 60, and according to a search the workforce is only around 15% boomer at this point. Millennials and zoomers are going to be locked in the room that is our society and have to figure out a path forward.I was worried about the disappearance of teenage jobs at least a decade ago. My job as a teenager mostly sucked but ultimately it was a good thing for me and most people I talk to feel the same way. Zoomers don’t have that, and worse than that, they never had a chance to have it. Those jobs also going to adults means that politicians have an incentive to meddle with the labor market more, and they have, to mostly disastrous effect in places like New York and California. I outlined my observation of zoomer’s mentality in another post in this thread, but I think on this both sides make plenty of good points. Zoomersareobnoxious and entitled, but their economic concerns are legitimate. We have to figure out a path forward here, but I also think the Christmas massacre of Vivek followed by the Panda Express debacle actually is the beginning of that discussion.

Given how policymakers often are detached from reality it was a positive thing to see this inanity shoved down the Tech Bros’ throats. As someone else pointed out on this thread, watching the political fossils try to destroy much younger nominees in the Senate confirmation hearings and still come off as the retarded and corrupt buffoons they are also is satisfying.To be clear, I wasn’t Boomer-bashing–to the degree it matters, I am one–but the criticism of our cluelessness largely is valid even if though some of the knocks in other areas are innumerate at best. Because I saw this attitude among my peers, it is sad to see the X’ers and Millennials displaying the same mentality toward those younger than them. It took a long time to get into such a bad position and it will take a long time and a lot of cooperation to get out of it. I know Z often is obnoxious but they are much more grounded in reality in many ways, too. They are the future.

                “The youngest boomers are 60, and according to a search the workforce is only around 15% boomer at this point. ” Do we think that the WWII generation was occupying 15% of the workforce at that advanced age? One of the goals of social security was to make room for younger workers. All the decision makers are still Boomers with a few scattered Gen Xers here and there. People are correct to kick the boomers, because the boomers have not let go. They have not invested in the future. We are all trapped in the Boomer room and there’s no escape.I agree that Gen Z and millennials will be locked in a room at some point, but that might be a much bigger, if more chaotic one.

                    No, 15% of the workforce was definitely not WWII generation when they were in their 60s and 70s. But the WWII generation labor force was also not doing the work that boomers are doing now. When you are doing hard physical labor, it just becomes impossible at a certain age. If you are a manager working in a downtown skyscraper, you can do that well into your 70s and do it well. I don’t necessarily blame a 75 year old accountant or finance guy because he wants to keep working and his company wants him to keep working. Retirement is very difficult for many people and in many ways unnatural.Also – 15% is, needless to say, the highest number it is going to be moving forward. Every day that number shrinks and GenX/Millennials take on more responsibilities. I think it’s reasonable to criticize the boomers for the world they have left us, but as of now I think GenX/Millennials/Zoomers need to look past that.

                        “you can do that well into your 70s and do it well. I don’t necessarily blame a 75 year old accountant or finance guy because he wants to keep working and his company wants him to keep working. […] I think it’s reasonable to criticize the boomers for the world they have left us, but as of now I think GenX/Millennials/Zoomers need to look past that.”I gave you the upvote, but my point is exactly we can’t move on for the reasons given. That 15% is largely in the decision making area. The C-suite’s median age has risen with the Boomers. Look at Congress. Look at the US Presidency.  I think of the COVID mass hysteria as largely Boomers dealing with the issue that the flu is now a fatal possibility for many of them.  We have probably another what 10 years or so before the reins are really handed over in meaningful way. And by “handed over” I mean tugged out of their cold and dead heads.In other words, we are locked in the room with the Boomers in charge still to this day. The Boomers haven’t “left us” anything yet.

                            I totally agree with your assessment of the COVID thing, it was boomers. That said, I have not kept up with aggregate trends in the boardrooms and C-suites, although in my first hand observation I have seen younger people take the reigns and older people move on. Apparently the average age of Fortune 500 CEOs at this point is late 50s, which is juuuuust on the border between gen X and boomer. I guess my point on this was that a 75 year old guy working as a part time accountant is a logical choice, he’s not doing it out of spitefulness or because he hates his grandkids (although he may), he just feels like he can work and can contribute, it’s not vindicative. And, i would say, an old boomer is better than a pajeet.Obviously, the gerontacracy in DC is getting embarrassing at this point and just keeps getting worse and more humiliating.

                            There are a lot of super-annuated CPAs and Financial Advisors out there. My dad had one, and we paid dearly for him retaining his Biden clone.
But it’s easy to deal with. All you have to do is be a better CPA than a dementia patient. Be a better middle-manager than the guy who falls asleep in meetings.

            Outside of STEM, young white men should avoid all college with extreme prejudice.  There is nothing there for them except constant shaming and disenfranchisement by coddled white girls and the Of Colored activists.  And there are no jobs waiting for them after college.
Enter the trades, arrange internet income, or simply hide from the malevolent ruling class and culture.  The latter is what millions of them already are doing.

                Pet peeve post, please ignore:“STEM” is current_year’s ugliest invention. Nerds dishonestly including math in the soulless drone training program they actually advocate—and qualify for—is grotesque.Mathematics is great philosophy. Mathematicians are absolute psychos. They can’t do a job! They’re academic charity cases, maintained like the hunchback in the bell tower, as long-term investments inprobably nothing—but maybe you get a Dirac or Planck to change the world (and list among your alumni). Their job is being crazy, like method actors and rock stars. Mere scientists and engineers/”engineers” claiming mathematics as their own is stolen valor. They use math like a janitor uses a mop.Now that the Asians are here and we can’t do anything about that, white kids should consider “STEM” (except for the disciplines habitually designated as “pure,” which are actually humanities) beneath them. It’s coolie work. Make it your hobby if you really want to solder something and shock yourself. Have agarage centrifuge. Have dignity. Don’t work for anybody, ever.

            According to an internet search about 20M people are enrolled in college right now. So that means that ~5M people on an annual basis are graduating and looking for work. Does the system have five million jobs for them? Of course not, especially when you factor in that the regime wants foreign helots doing the work, not Americans.

                No. Graduation rates vary, but a quick search says the nationwide rate is 62%.  I’m sure that is inflated as the education cartel has been fudging their numbers for decades.  That is another huge problem in this discussion, the millions who took on debt and never got the degree that was supposed to be the golden ticket to the middle class.  The only way I could see to correct this would be to force colleges to cover the student loan costs of drop outs, but even that would just lead to comic levels of grade inflation beyond what happens already. It would take the threat of administrators going to prison to bring meaningful reform to higher ed.

                    Companies need to be allowed to go back to interviewing practices that actually test for competence, something they were forced to abandon after it was claimed to be discrimination with “disparate impact”.In response, they began to demand degrees as a token of competence which they could lean on to explain their hiring decisions.To which the Left countered by demanding that all their favorite victims should have access to those credentials too.The colleges loved that idea, because increased enrollment meant more gravy for their train. It’s no coincidence that educators are a major Democrat constituency or that the Democrats support federal “student aid” which funnels taxpayer money to this favored constituency.The kids are right. It’s all a scam.

                    If you make colleges responsible for their empty promises to enrollees, then they will raise their standards to admit fewer, but better students.  No matter how you cut it, there are at least twice the number of students in college than there should be (with TV’s and 70’s type standards).
This is why corporation now require a college degree for jobs that never required such—and still don’t.  Degree holder are a dime a dozen.

        There are a couple problems. When the boomers fondly recall their time as fry-cooks putting themselves through college and making rent, they’re conceding the point. They were able to put themselves through college AND make rent flipping burgers. Real estate and education are two of the biggest inflationary commodities these days, and nobody’s making enough slinging fries to even get close to covering rent without several roommates, much less education. I worked several jobs during college and during the summer. The money I made defrayed a lot of the expenses from my state-school education, but they couldn’t come close to covering the bill.Additionally, most of the older generations found their way to meaningful employment by 23. Whether this was union labor, trade jobs, or white collar work, they were largely making enough money to live comfortably and start families. Today’s youth are largely locked out of the job market from both sides with labor being dominated by illegals and white-collar work being automated, outsourced, and reserved for H1Bs. The ones who do find gainful employment are typically affected indirectly by wage deflation if they’re not being replaced outright. Real estate seems like a pipe dream to most young people. You’re lucky if you’re in a place you can comfortably raise kids by the time you’re 30.The societal effects from this will be crippling. White people don’t breed in captivity. I’ve seen a lot of advice on twitter coming from older people about “bootstraps” recently. The more comical ones were dumpster-diving for barely-expired milk and buying a plot in a graveyard and pitching a tent there as your domicile while bemoaning the fact that youngsters are too “privileged” to engage in these behaviors. The advice is entirely disingenuous as the people offering it would never engage in it themselves. Additionally, it’s non-functional advice. Dumpster diving and living in a hooch in a graveyard does not lead to family formation. If you do have a family and engage in such behaviors, you’re liable to get child protective services called on you. The demographic crisis will continue.The vast majority of the older generations have no practical advice to give, and the rest of us would prefer if they kept their mouths shut. The reason I have a wife, kids, and a house is because I actively ignored boomer advice and tried to adapt to the new reality.

            Slinging fries paid maybe $6. The reason we could afford it was room, board, books and tuition was $1500 a semester or a bit more, so long as you lived with several roommates. The most expensive textbook I had to buy was $60. That was in 1989.
Why did college costs skyrocket? Ultimately, because students and their parents would pay. And when gov jumped in with both feet to make it more affordable, just like everything else they do, you got the exact opposite.

            “The vast majority of the older generations have no practical advice to give, and the rest of us would prefer if they kept their mouths shut. The reason I have a wife, kids, and a house is because I actively ignored boomer advice and tried to adapt to the new reality.”
Exactly. Most of my best moves were ignoring Boomer advice, even 20 years ago. It’s unfortunate, and not how it’s supposed to work. But there it is.

        All sides have a point.Young people today definitely have way too high of expectations across all fronts.  And their pussies that complain about the unfairness of life  and petty setbacks.  Overall, I’d say that they been very poorly served by the education system which has primarily instilled a sense of entitlement and idealistic expectations.On the other hand, opportunity in the US is much more constrained than it was generations ago.  Youth today are wealthier in the base materialistic sense, but poorer in the ability to go out on their own and build success in unpredictable ways.  As an older businessman I’d say that is larger because of the litigiousness of America and the fear it instills.On the third hand, America has become a zoo, with numerous groups crammed together and separated in micro enclosures. No common culture and no room to roam.  Under constant surveillance with everyone at each others throats.  The whole thing is just stifling.  TPTB have responded with ever shifting etiquette and pharmacological interventions – which make matters ever worse.

            Yes. A good share of the problem I’m seeing with regards to employability is the same as why even the ones who supposedly are seeking wife material come up dry — that stupid little screen is the only way they can communicate.
I’ve taken a chance on people with marketing degrees only to find out they have no people skills. When I want someone who can talk to people, I’m not finding much outside someone in his mid to upper 40s to early 60s, and we all know what that means re: health insurance.

        Superb summation of the society: a smash and grab.A couple of other aspects of the modern society need to be noted: young white men are the least prepared to deal with the modern society and are the most lied to.A young white man is told he has privilege and if he works hard he can have the American dream including a house, girl and and the necessary good job. Reality is there might as well be “White men need not apply”signs especially when it comes to management.Consequently the good job, girl and house are increasingly out of reach for many young men. Stating the obvious about what is happening to white men can destroy the life of the managerial class unless they support it as punishment for white privilege.Parents have a hard time understanding this is happening and many parents support this jihad because that is what good people do they are told. To make matters worse, young women are helping lead the charge to destroy the future of young white men. This enables alphas and high status men to more easily stand out.We owe it to boys to prepare them for this reality at the very least rather than give them pep talks and pretend reality is right wing disinformation pushed by Putin.

                That’s kind of circular, though. Any girl who wants to be a tradwife needs some indication that a potential mate is capable of owning a home. Flashy cars and fancy clothes don’t do it — that only grabs the gold diggers. Tradwives see him as a probable spendthrift.
Unless he is handing out audited financial statements when they strike up a conversation, there is absolutely no way for her to know what she’s getting into.

        Great post, Z.
A couple years ago, I placed a call to the local papa John’s number and spoke with an incoherent Indian woman. I asked her if she was at the restaurant and she said something about a call service. I heard a rooster crow and asked her if she was in America and told her we were no longer interested in ordering anything.The kid who answered the phone at Pizza Hut to take our order attends the local high school.

                “American” in the name of anything means it’s not for White people.  USAA being case in point, or “People For the American Way.”  There is no national group, company, or organization that gives a damn about Whites, so stop joining them and use your money to benefit yourself and your children.

            Being a woman who raises children is lazy and low class. We literally call them “not working” Until Dads are willing to be proud of their marred daughters, rather than try to them respectable hard working sons, not much of the social aspect changes.

                Could not agree more.The U.S. is full of conservative and Christian dads-of-daughters who just as energetically as the Progs prepared their girls for Hard Charging Empowered Careers and decidedly NOT for motherhood.MUH Princess ain’t ever gonna need no man!  It’ll be just her and me all our lives.  Hmm yes well what a noble and patriotic sentiment.Folks on this forum magically want the Old America back again.  They want a White Nation.Well the first step to that is to STOP preparing your Entitled Ones for careers and START preparing them to be wives and mothers.  Girls when I grew up sought to be married with children.  Now they are all feral Disney Princesses and both their parents and culture made them thataway.That’s the biggest difference between America in the Fifties and post Seventies Amerika.

                    Good thought, but the causality arrow is reversed. There’s no point in training girls for motherhood if the best they are going to be able to do is a cubicle rat who can never afford a house.
Until we start raising boys to engage with the system as it exists, as in, learn a trade and start your own company and build it to a dozen trucks hiring man-children whose highest aspiration is to be an employee, or some other lucrative business, you will be damning your Princess to a life of poverty.

Taking everything away from boys and young men, and then telling them, as you do, that they are man-children is stock feminist cant.  We’ve already heard all that the past 50 years.
At least come up with a novel insult, and don’t just borrow from the pink-haired crowd.

@3g4me is correct that we need to build a parallel system, then withdraw from the other. How precisely can you do that without a strong entrepreneurial attitude?
Big Boxes edged out many of the Mom &amp; Pops. Which means the glory years had enough entrepreneurial types to HAVE Mom &amp; Pops. You can’t get Main Street back without people willing to open stores on Main Street.

                                This is a non-sequitur. I replied to your absolutely parody-defying statement mocking people “whose highest aspiration is to be an employee.”You’ve got some serious Randian baggage, man. I had to do a double-take just to ensure I hadn’t accidentally landed on National Review’s website.The world needs competent employees, fairly paid, to build healthy families, which will raise healthy, upright and productive children. Our infrastructure crumbles in large part due to our management class’ wholesale embrace of the attitude you’ve expressed here. Employees should not be regarded as fungible cogs. If you want to fix things, start by retraining your thoughts along those lines.

                                Also, “we need more entrepreneurs to open Mom &amp; Pops to out-compete the corporate consolidation that … killed off the Mom &amp; Pops in the first place” is an unfathomably unserious proposal.As the saying goes, “when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Well, the boomercon’s hammer is evidently a bottomless reserve of thoughtless and self-serving cliches. Blame the victim for not opening enough small businesses, yeah, that’ll work.We clearly need to do something about the corporate consolidation that saw Big Box stores kill the Mom &amp; Pops, and which currently sees the Big Box stores embattled by the likes of Amazon. Yes, absolutely right. But it’s a complex problem, which will require a multivariate solution, many aspects of which will require something I doubt you will ever countenance: the dreaded government interference–anti-trust enforcement, tariffs, harsh fees/penalties for employing foreigners, among other things.

OK, and in what fantasyland are you going to find a government which does that? Again, despite the fact that even CNN polls were going 70% in favor of closing the border, what was government’s reaction?

As far as I’m concerned northern European countries, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, etc. are the world standard. That ethos is what made this country work.

        I was 29 and had been through military, college, and numerous minimum-wage or no-wage (internship) gigs before I got my first offer at a decent job.  The prospective employers could see I’d paid dues and was relentless in pursuit of secure employment.Perhaps today’s youth want good jobs presented to them?  Like the Participation Ribbon they all get in gym?  It only works that way for the female half of ‘today’s youth’, who are perennial favorites for employment in government and corporations.  Females have to be total screw-ups not to get hired by one of those foul entities.Boys and young white men are on the bottom of the pile.  The corporations openly refuse to hire them, in favor of the of-coloreds and the white princesses.  Many young men are rejecting the woke/feminist society constructed over the past five decades, a nation not merely amasculine but rabidly anti-masculine.  They saw what was done to their dads and uncles and older brothers, and they want no part of Ms. Amerika.

        I think one of the problems for American kids going to college is the false assumption that just having a college degree will guarantee them a secure career and bright future.But when they show up for an interview with a degree in gender studies, they wonder why no one is interested in hiring them. Of course one has to wonder who would even offer an interview to someone with that sort of degree in the first place.We can always blame a culture of smartphones, online gaming and whatever distraction you might point to for why these kids are so ill prepared for their future. But the fact remains, the American school system it not there to educate children. It serves as a tax funded day-care center which simply pushes kids through the system and out the door at the end of 12th grade with no concern whether or not they can even read or write. I read recently that in some States, teachers don’t even have to be skilled in the subjects they teach. Where are the outraged parents?Unfortunately here in Europe even our University degreed engineers are having a tough time of it. While I would argue the average student in Germany is head and shoulders above a US student of the same age, there are far less opportunities here at home after graduation. For students in France, Italy, Spain and the UK, it’s even worse. I know some German kids who have left Germany and headed to either the US or Asia. But Asian countries have raised the level of education of their own people, so Europeans need not apply.Here at home we can lay most of the blame for this situation on decades of German and EU Government policies which have failed to invest or promote an entrepreneurial environment for industry. They somehow expected legacy companies like VW, Mercedes and Siemens could just keep operating like they always have. We are faced with the fact that jobs across the board are fewer and farther between for both skilled workers such as plumbers, electricians and carpenters, as well as engineers and high tech people.I have a colleague in the US who’s daughter is going to graduate this spring with auseless liberal arts degreefrom a well known University in the Bay Area. She worked at Starbucks most of four years she was going to school to help supplement her college fees while still living at home. When I asked about her career plans after graduation he told me it’s very likely she will just keep working at Starbucks.To me this is mind boggling; the girl has over $150k in student debt and is planning her future as a barista in the Bay Area? Who thinks for a second this is a good idea?

            To be fair, the concern isn’t over the kid with the gender studies or other liberal arts degree. Highly talented and skilled STEM grads are being passed over for H1B’s and vibrants with far less qualification. The deliberate anti-white and anti-male discrimination is a very real problem. The Bay area kid you described likely will live at home into her Thirties but that was utterly predictable.As for Germany, yes, I have family there and what you describe is spot on. While the decline has been ongoing for a while, the Ukraine madness really accelerated matters. Any European kid who is applying for employment in Asia, by the way, learns very quickly that the anti-racism drivel they were force fed is not a universally shared outlook, to say the least.

                “Gender studies” graduates—almost nobody has that title outside conservatives’ fantasies of their unemployment, butbroadly speaking—have no trouble getting jobs. Teaching, government, and media are full of them. Every white-country corporation large enough for us to know its name has alayerof them. They’re half of the Women In Tech™ who replaced the founding nerds in management over the last thirty years—soon themselves to be replaced by Indians.

It’s how they get white people to identify with a regime specifically aiming to destroy them—andit says that’s what it’s doing. “End Whiteness? Yeah,thatguy deserves it.

        Part of the problem of expectations are the endless lies on social media.  The lifestyle influencer paints a very false picture of her existence on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.  They think they should have such a life by 21.
OTOH, a lot of their complaints are very real and worthy of our attention.  When I was a young guy, you could buy an old but running car for 500 Dollars.  You could rent a small apartment for 5-700 a month in a reasonable neighborhood.  Plus the dating market is all screwed up.

That’s not even that long ago. In W’s first year, premium gasoline was under a buck. To be sure, the $500 cars were rust buckets, but if you knew a little about wrenching, fully usable. Warren Terra ended the cheap gas, Cash for Clunkers ended the cheap cars.

        The largest gap for the younger generation appears to be reasonably priced starter housing that is physically co-incident with decent paying jobs.Yes, there is reasonably priced housing in lower cost of living areas. The trouble is that there are not large amounts of decent paying jobs in those areas because small and medium-sized manufacturing has been gutted in this country.Remote work is an option, but that appears to be on the decline for various reasons.Builders are shying away from constructing starter housing because it has a lower profit margin. That is a rational economic decision on their part.I wish I had a good answer for incentivizing the construction of starter housing. I feel like more government intervention is the last thing this country needs.

            But why is the margin on starter homes lower? Code compliance is basically fixed cost. Might as well use higher grade materials and make them larger.
Don’t forget, we are seeing the effects of a Canadian softwood tariff. Which Trump is proposing raising. Tariffs are not the unalloyed boon portrayed.

                You are correct about code compliance inflation. It’s not possible to buy a 1950’s starter house because it would no longer be code. Tariffs however, even if bungled, are a step out of open borders economics. I’m not against baby steps in the correct direction.

                    I don’t know how much of a house price is affected by softwood tariffs, between studs, joists, rafters, sheathing, subfloor, glulam, etc., but at a guess, you are easily paying several tens of thousands more for that house, and  gave that money to the Bidet administration. Who used it to import more foreigners and give them those houses.

We remodeled about 5/6 of our house about 7 years ago. We spent a lot of money bringing things up to code, including unnecessary insulation and possibly over doing framing. The wood required was not most of the cost. Would today’s lumber cost bring the remodel out of reach? Possibly. However, artificially low material costs can be seen as subsidizing unnecessary code updates.

                            Right. Several tens of thousands is still not the majority of a house price. But it is still several tens of thousands. And it still was used to bring in Haitians and other furriners to culturally enrich us.
If artificially inflating house prices would save America, I’d be all for it. Any dispassionate analysis says it does the opposite.

                    Sort of. If there were a sizable fraction of people with cash in hand for the downpayment, I have no doubt someone would cater to it. But the fact is the starter-home demographic simply does not have that kind of cash.
The difference in the basic materials and labor for a starter home vs. a mid-tier home is not much. So if for a $20k of investment in better trim materials means you can add $100k to the price, why not? A Millenial gets to upgrade, while the government buys up the Millenial’s old house to use for Section 8.

        “Americans are forced to compete with the world’s poorest for jobs, and the world’s richest for housing.”I wish I could take credit for that quote.  I can’t remember where I first saw it, but it stuck with me.  There is no pithier summary.It is true that our youth frequently hold inflated expectations.  It’s also true that they exhibit numerous pathologies peculiar to the era–low attention spans, social awkwardness, brittle egos; the list goes on.  Their complaints about the job market aren’t always reasonable.I’m not “on” Twitter.  My understanding of current social media spats tends toward superficial, but what I’ve seen suggests that the “old people camp” in this story are at best guilty of poor taste.  They may have some good points here or there.  Their opponents may have some dumb ones, but the essence of the youths’ complaint is entirely valid.  Hearing warmed over NRO-boomercon talking points in response, particularly in the wake of the H1B controversy, only feeds the youths’ resentment.How quickly we went from “There aren’t enough engineers,” to “Unemployed engineers should content themselves with warming up chinese food for a living!”The elephant in the room is housing.  A slightly smaller gorilla, sitting next to the elephant, is health care, and from there we can go down the list–but really what we’re discussing is the all-important question: “Can the average person build a family and have a decent life?”  The answer to that question, for a growing number of our youth, is “I doubt it.”And so they check out, a lot of them.  The culture doesn’t value work, anyway, at least not the kind of work carried out by employees.  If you’re not a business owner, or in some kind of upper management/finance role, you’re shit.  It’s no wonder people feel that way: our rulers have spent decades signaling that no matter what your job is, no matter the level of your expertise, they are ever eager to replace you with the cheapest foreigner they can find.Employees of any shape or size, therefore, are value-less cogs by definition.  We’ve seen that attitude expressed here in this very comment thread.  The reflexive Chamber of Commerce boomercon bromides die hard, even in our little corner of Dissidentopia.Is it any wonder that our youth place an ever increasing emphasis on what you might call lottery-winner roles–twitch streamers, youtube influencers, bitcoin “gurus”.  What we’re seeing is basically the young white person version of that old cliche about black families who pin all their hopes on little Jaquan’s slim chance at making it in the NFL.So yeah, if you’re a young person who actually does have his head on straight, a young white guy who did all of the right things only to find that it’s nearly impossible just to land an interview, and some asshole who made his money in a divorce settlement (i.e. Cernovich) tells you that AKSHULLY the totally-legit-no-really-i’m-serious statistics show that the economy’s doing AMAZEBALLS if you’re just willing to apply some ELBOW GREASE … well, let’s just say that I’m amazed at how civil the discourse remains.

        Inflation is the goal of AINO’s economic system. You’ll hear them talk about their 2% inflation “target” all the time. Which slowly leads to the same place that higher inflation leads to quickly. But most of the people are so gaslit that they’ve been persuaded that there’s something healthy about 2%. Healthy for bankers, but not for most of us. Thus, it was inevitable that a point would be reached when younger generations couldn’t attain the standard of living of the older ones. Regardless of the other factors under discussion. Perpetual inflation guarantees it. The only cure is deflation. Which the bankers will send you to fight to the death to prevent.

                Actually its the opposite.  36 trillion in DEBT makes deflation all but inevitable.  Either you default and get deflation, government shrinks, corporations shrink and the population shrinks.  Or you get printing, hyperinflation, .gov stays in control a bit longer but still fails and we have corporate warlords fighting over the remains if any survive.

        In the before times, testing revealed that only 50 percent of students derived much benefit from education after age 12, 20 percent above age 16, and just 10 percent beyond age 18. Of course, that data came from White school children. Add the lowest common denominator of diversity into the mix, and it’s not hard to see why sending 60 percent of students to college would result in missed expectations and unpayable debt.

        That said, the youth of the past did not like working in high school and would have preferred to hang out with friends playing video games.I liked my high school job. I worked at a veterinary hospital cleaning cages and doing other dirty work, eventually getting some more responsible assignments and skills. The main boss, the head vet, could be extremely verbally abusive, but while I hated getting yelled at, it was like having a drill sergeant — I probably deserved most of the yelling I received. It toughened me up. It meant a lot to me when I finally did receive his approval.The worst part of the job was bitchy female co-workers. There were two in particular who seemed to go out of their way to be nasty. Back then, all the veterinarians at the practice were male, and the help like me was divided between male and female, but trending female. Now females dominate veterinary medicine schools. Two of the three closest male vets who work with large animals near me have retired, and women honestly often can’t handle the rough physical work with cattle (more of them go into horses, but horses are, on average, easier to work with than cattle, though sometimes still very physical).I didn’t have the job “to make ends meet.” It was all disposable income that I mostly spent on bass guitars, guitars, amps, mics, etc. for my band. Still, I was very proud when I started being able to buy my instruments with my own money instead of Mom and Dad paying for them. It was just recognized then that was part of becoming an adult — paying your own way in ways that you were able.

        I am not on twitter so I don’t have the full context for the discussion.The crux of this seems to be that no one wants to accept a lifestyle lower than their parents.  Unfortunately, that’s the reality for almost all younger people these days.  For the most part I don’t think any generation as truly accepted this.High schoolers, and even college grads, typically work low skilled jobs. Today, depending on your location, these jobs also look like bus stops in Tijuana or Haiti.The lucky grads who find high skilled work, say in tech or finance, will find their workplace looks like an India-China border town bus stop. To find such a job is to compete with the entire world, and the degree mills not only in other countries, but also the universities in this country, which pump out tens of thousands of masters, often to international students.Some advice that I share to others, and young people, is that everyone needs to at least tread water: get at least some degree. Do not drop out of college, no matter what.  Even the dumbest people you can imagine are getting these credentials.  Carefully evaluate the ROI – in terms of debt and opportunity cost – on the type of degree you get: not all bachelors are equal. Terminal masters are largely a scam, but may be needed in some industries. To find high wage work you will need to grind. Get credentials, do internships, research, make connections while in college.  Be prepared to send out hundreds, if not thousands of applications, and experience innumerable rejections. This is a numbers game. Reach out to all of your connections, as well as people you don’t know, to get more opportunities. That is what it takes these days.

            The big fight on Twitter was over foreign visa employees. Go to school, get a tech degree, start a career and work your way up – that was the deal.
Then they all get fired and replaced by Indian indentured servants with fake degrees making half the pay.  That’s the betrayal.
And anyone who has been in the inner workings of corporate operations knows that working with the Indians is a nightmare and not worth the savings.
Then… Elon Musk complains that the generation of unemployed 25 year-olds he replaced with foreigners aren’t having enough kids.

            My favorite meme i saw on the Twitter fight:
“If I had two bullets and was faced with an enemy and a traitor, I would turn around and shoot my grandchildren twice. – boomers”
Thats the crux of the entire fight. Betrayal over immigration and the contract by fucking boomers who would gladly destroy an inheritance for one more fucking bruce Springsteen concert.

                Your boomer bile is vile. There are millions of ‘boomers’ like me who had no part in all this shit you’re all bitching about and I think the entire situation sucks. I myself got pushed out of a pretty decent paying IT job after 40 years by some young goddamn dot and a witch of a white female manager. So there’s that.And sure it’s no picnic today, it never was. I was in HS and collage in the 70s, talk about suck. No jobs, stagflation, oil crisis, 20+% interest rates. In retrospect I don’t ever remember one of my contemporaries screaming bloody murder nonstop at the previous generation and how it was all their fault so just fucking die already.And by the way I absolutely despise Bruce Fucking Springsteen.Good luck to you.

                        “I mean good god, did nobody think opening the floodgates to the world and killing freedom of association would lead to horrible outcomes for their posterity?”Of course they did. The so-called “Boomer problem” has nothing whatsoever to do with an age cohort and *everything* to do with culture. And the question you ask has *everything* to do with that.It takes only 60 seconds or so to look up which states’ representatives voted in favor of Hart-Cellar and which did not.Of COURSE people foresaw what was coming, and they SAID SO, but since they were Southerners–and therefore automatically ignorant “racists”–they were ignored, and here we are.Just look it up. Our situation today is unconnected with a birth cohort but rather with a  kind of cultural ignorance on the part of non-Southerners, which ignorance destroyed freedom of association AND threw open the floodgates of Third-World of immigration because they refused to believe the testimony of the only Americans who actually KNEW what it mean to live cheek-by-jowl with non-European populations for four centuries.None of this ever had anything to do with a birth cohort, and everything to do with a culture founded upon a childish idealism combined with abysmal ignorance and cultural prejudice and bigotry towards the South and towards the racial attitudes of Southerners, which were founded upon centuries of first-hand experience.” … and was introduced by SenatorPhilip Hartand CongressmanEmanuel Celler.[5]However, its passage was stalled due to opposition from conservative Congressmen.[6]With the support of the Johnson administration, Celler and Hart introduced the bill again in 1965 to repeal the formula.[7]The bill received wide support from both northernDemocraticandRepublicanmembers of Congress, but strong opposition mostly from Southern conservatives, the latter mostly voting Nay or Not Voting.[8][9][…].”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965

Than Bush 1 increased legal immigration and Bush 2 tried another freaking amnesty. Who voted for them and thought increasing legal immigration to the moon and ignorint illegal immigration was great? Amazing how these cohorts come together to shit on their posterity.

                            Exactly. Excellent and measured comment. Non-Southern Silents and Greatest Generation WHITES (and of course “whites”) own mass migration, and even that generalization is very unfair since the average Gentile in the relevant cohort wasn’t down with population replacement. As everyone knows, there is absolutely no public input into policy despite the faux claims of popular democracy, and that’s been the case a very, very long time and even predates the Supreme Court’s heavy hand. We expect this type behavior from Cellar, but white devout Irish Catholic Hart is a warning that it didn’t take that all much deviation from the Founding stock to start to get some really bad actors.*eta: And not to contradict my frequent bloggy horse, the Puritan contingent of the Founders contained some of the most vile, anti-white villains in human history.

                That sounds like an excellent meme with quite the kernel of truth.And yes – thereare plenty of Boomers who fit the stereotype – but not all.  And, as noted here before, most Boomers were too young to vote on the immigration and civil rights acts – that was ‘Greatests’ and ‘Silents’ – but Boomers did wholly embrace the results and pushed diversity on all Whites worldwide.

                    It’s true, many of us Boomers went along with the immigration and civil rights acts — because it appealed to the naive morality that was pitched to us with insipid songs like “All You Need is Love”, “Imagine”, and “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing in Perfect Harmony”.What we’re mostly guilty of is being brainwashed by propaganda like that. The question Zoomers bashing us should be asking is where and by whom all that stuff was being promulgated.And if and when they ask that question, I hope they will keep in mind that we didn’t have as many sources of information as they’ve grown up with, so the propagandists had a much easier time seducing us. Whatever underground press we had was mostly even further Left. Rightwing stuff was heavily stigmatized as fit only for cranks.

            Or perhaps – instead of grinding away trying to compete with billions of non-White aliens – Whites could focus on a parallel society, helping, hiring, and promoting their own.  Why invest in a system that wants White people dead?  So they can work under Indian bosses and marry a Han?

        Z, you missed a massive problem in this post that also ties in with your birth rate podcast where you also missed it.Today’s youth can’t afford houses. Houses are absurdly more expensive now compared to median income. For our grandparents and parents, the median house cost compared to median income was around 3-4x, it’s now 7x. A public college education is 42% of the median yearly income compared to 14-17% for our parents and grandparents. You mention kids living at home, THIS IS WHY. Boomers gloss over this fact or can’t comprehend how wages haven’t kept up with the absurd inflation of housing and college. This is also a huge part of why birth rates have dropped. How can you have kids if you can’t afford a house and you’re living at home?By the way, yes this is tied in with demographics. Shipping in millions of immigrants inflates housing prices. If you deported a few million people, you’d finally start to see some relief, but the boomers would have a panic attack at this. In my area, houses are driven higher by mostly Indian and Chinese buyers paying cash for $1,000,000 houses that are 1,400 square feet. Send those H1-Bs home and what happens?

            And just to give a specific example: My grandfather was a cop.Grandmother was a house wife. He made right around the median income at the time (50th percentile). He bought a house and a beachfront property on that salary. My wife and I both make 6 figures and are in the top 10%. I’m quite thrifty, and I couldn’t dream of buying the property he bought because of the cost. Again, this is what boomers don’t understand. They just spit out the “work hard and it’ll be yours too” without really analyzing the changes in conditions.

            “Boomers gloss over this fact or can’t comprehend how wages haven’t kept up with the absurd inflation of housing and college.”Or want you to focus long enough to understand the source of that absurd inflation. Like Mr. House said, inflation is not a force of nature.“If you deported a few million people, you’d finally start to see some relief, but the boomers would have a panic attack at this.”Why? People have already pointed out that it’s cheaper for Boomers not to downsize.Housing is a stupid benchmark, anyway. At whatever price level you cash out, you are going to have to buy/rent into the same price level. The only way to avoid that is to die.

            Even the median numbers are probably too optimistic.  Decades ago, a “median” house would have been located in a reasonably safe neighborhood, with a serviceable public school nearby.  In the 2020s, I’m not so sure about either of those assumptions.  I won’t even discuss our prospects for fruitful and fulfilling community relationships.
Immigration offers compounding challenges on the housing market–it simultaneously raises demand and degrades the practical value of cheaper housing.  We appear to be hurtling towards a strict dichotomy, between those who live in walled palaces, and those who live in the surrounding favela.

        It’ll be alright. Granted, I’m behind schedule, but I have a freaking BFA, and I’m making decent money doing fairly high-skilled and technical labor that I worked my way into. Not done, either. Maybe go back to school and get that profession my family wanted for me. Thinking about it. Special, stupid case, this one 😃Point being, the worm has turned, in my experience. After the collapse of conservatism and the woke beat down, after a decade of laboring in obscurity for me, doors are starting to open. Methinks society is finally starting to figure out we don’t have the luxury of being indulgent and screwing around. And maybe I’m finally growing up.Take heart, if I can do it, anybody can.

            but I have a freaking BFA, and I’m making decent money doing fairly high-skilled and technical labor that I worked my way into.I feel ya. My degree is in journalism, but I wasn’t the typical journalism major. I was good at math and computers, so I also had a really strong suite of computer science courses — not enough that it officially countered as a minor, but close. I probably could have argued for it if I was a striver.Anyway, I realized while I was working for the local paper that I am just not nosy enough to be a reporter. A guy in the newsroom computer systems department noticed that I was handy with the systems and encouraged me to apply for an open spot they had. And so I spent the rest of my career in IT, networking and software. Was even part owner of an ISP back in the dialup days. Went on to development, professional services, system architecture, etc., finally sales engineer. Life is funny. I never predicted that’s where I would end up, but if I was outside looking in, it probably would have been obvious.For most of my career nobody gave a shit what my degree was in, because I did good work. Finally, in 2013, the company I was with was close to falling apart and they put this completely evil, grifter Chinese guy in charge of the part of the development group that I was working in. He was a recent hire working on some company side project and knew nothing about what I was working on, which was the company’s major product. He was always blowing his own horn about how rich and successful he was, but I investigated him and discovered that he made all his money settling on shady patent lawsuits with big companies he’d contracted with. They just wanted him to go away.Early on, he asked, “Is your degree in Computer Science or Engineering?” I could have just lied. But keep in mind that at this point I’m 50 years old and have been doing this kind of work for nearly 30 years. I’m not ashamed — who gives a fuck what they wrote on a piece of paper 30 years ago? But the minute I told him my degree was in journalism, he wrote me off. I got laid off after 13 years with the company. I ripped the guy a new one in the exit interview. I really didn’t care if I was burning bridges at that point.I saw it coming and already had an interview scheduled with what turned out to be my next employer even before they hit me with the layoff. I got a decent severance package, but the sweetest part was a few weeks later when a different engineering manager called me and asked me if I’d come back to finish what I was working on for the next release. I basically told them to fuck off (not in those terms as the guy making the request wasn’t a bad guy himself).The company was out of business within the year.* My previous boss had always told me “If they ever lay you off, you might as well turn the lights out on the way out the door.” He was right.*It had been bought by Boeing a couple years before and they basically just killed the company and gobbled up the intellectual property after all the executive team’s retention agreements expired and they left. And we all know how well Boeing is being run.

        Working in manufacturing I see the young folks have it both hard and easy, but certainly they have be screwed over by the older generations.  The schools taught them nonsense and they have no skills.  On the other hand, they only have to show minimal competence and not cause trouble and the job will be handed to them.
In the old days business advertised for customers.  Now they advertise for workers.  And no:  H1Bs, Mestizos, and Africans are not going to be filling the needs.  The need is COMPETENCE.

            You know the other thing is pay. My aunt used to work for a car seat manufacturer as a seamstress. It was grueling work. A true sweatshop just in terms of what was required of you, though the employer was decent. I remember reading 10 or more years ago about a company trying to bring back seat manufacturing to Detroit. I think they were going to be paying $11 an hour or something like that at the time, which didn’t sound like a lot of money for the kind of work they would be doing.

        That said, the youth of the past did not like working in high school and would have preferred to hang out with friends playing video games.Nobody I knew disliked working in high school. Wages let us to do stuff like have an old car and keep it running, thereby having the means to be off somewhere on our own. At least we’d have our own money to spend on things we wanted,Among my early boomer cohort, a kid who spent all his time doing something analogous to staying passively at home and playing video games all day would have been marked as some sort of geek. He would have spent his high school years stuffed in his locker.

        The struggle for today’s youth is relatively easy, even if it is the result of a broken promise. In fact, young people probably have it too easy in many respects.
It’s not clear that they have it easier, given the crushing debt most of them incurred while in school. Granted, they took it on so they could enjoy the resort-style living for four (or more) years. Still, they have an unpleasant future to look forward to: one less optimistic and welcoming than boomers had.

        IMO, the most important new challenge that young people face today is the 100+ million additional people in the country due to mass immigration since 1965, and particularly since the ~1990, and not just the lettuce picking class. There has been a MASSIVE influx of people willing to do middle class jobs for what were once below market wages. Adding to the challenges, housing (owning and renting) is WAY more expensive because of the massive population increase, and affordable housing for middle to working class folks is often a 2 hour commute from where the jobs are. And on top of all of THIS, the financialization of the economy is hollowing out the stock of middle class jobs. What is left is massive numbers of low wage and menial jobs, unrelenting downward pressure on the wages for the relatively small number of middle class jobs, and an even smaller number of “elite” jobs, most of which contribute little or nothing to the actual well-being of the country, that pay absurdly high wages to the elite ruling class. I have an “above average” number of young adult children, and I see them either attempting to claw their way up the ladder, or being pushed down (by the cultural poison they have been fed rather than due to lack of intelligence or ability) into menial dead end work. For any parent with young children, my advice would to combat the toxic nonsense the public schools in America feed to children, however you can, with private/religious schooling, home schooling, etc. AND DON’T LET THEM HAVE SMART PHONES AND ACCESS TO SOCIAL MEDIA FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE!!!

        Many young people have figured out that the ticket to a decent lifestyle is a cushy job in government, a union, or government/military contracting (after a non-combat spell in the military, ideally skinning one’s knee so as to claim disability or hearing distant gunfire so as to claim PTSD).Work hard to start a business or excel in a profession? Why bust your gut doing that when you can have the above?But the problems affecting young people today chiefly involve poor public education, social media, and lack of parental involvement – and all the brainwashing, lack of skills, psychological issues they bring. A lot issues boil down to parents abdicating their duties and allowing their kids to be “educated” by public schools and social media.

        Entry level jobs in California are mostly filled by legal and illegal immigrants. The lower level hospital jobs where I worked were overwhelmingly staffed with non-white immigrants and the better-paying jobs became chiefly non-white over the 32 years I worked there. The lower level employees were Hispanic and Filipino, the higher paid were East Asian and Indian. Most of the whites were long-time employees hired before the big non-white influx who were slogging toward retirement. Go to a construction site here and the workers  are &gt;90% Hispanic, with a few white guys to supervise.

Under Obama they tried to cement in American young minds this is just how it is and it’s really your fault, and if not your fault, well, their favorite saying, “it is how it is”. Then came Trump and good jobs happened again, ones with a form you had to fill out saying you were a citizen.Then Biden happened, same as Obama as they fleeced us good.Now Trump again and the tech bros trying to HB1 us back to Obama years, which were good for them evidently, til their mansion burns down anyway.And MAGA said NO.

        There are plenty of opportunities for young people in our military.  It’s stronger than ever, gayness is mostly encouraged.  And that’s important since 83% of kids under 23 identify as very or extremely gay.
but most importantly, joining the military is the best way to fight antisemitism throughout the world.  Antisemitism is a growing problem and so is homophobia.  Also, racism is a huge problem in Russia, Iran and China.  Enlisting will give our young people meaning in their lives, instead of video games, tik tok and rap music.

        There might be some hope. I ran across this story today at the link below about a new defense plant being built in Ohio. 4000 new jobs because defense manufacturing is being onshored again. Largest job creating project in the history of Ohio. Mike DeWine maybe a RINO, but he’s hitting home runs when it comes to job creation.Offshoring defense manufacturing to third world countries that are unreliable and often hostile to us was just plain stupid. But stupid is par for the course among the smart set.But remember, Trump haters, Trump did that.My point is that I’m reasonably confident that the issues we are talking about here are being re-examined as we speak and I think we may end up being pleasantly surprised.https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/ohio-lands-major-defense-manufacturing-facility-creating-4000-jobs-by-2035-anduril-industries-governor-mike-dewine-jobsohio-pickaway-county-ohioone-defense-contract-weapons-manufacuring-great-power-competition-trump-military

            Good luck finding skilled machinists and CNC programmers to fill those jobs.    America didn’t just hollow out its manufacturing base;  It also hollowed out its human capital.  H1Bs, Mestizos and Africans are NOT high quality human capital.

            Yeah, but it’s defense industry. Building something with the intent to blow it up, or, best case, stuff it in a warehouse somewhere until it ages out and has to be replaced. That’s a dead loss.
I’m not so worried about the 4,000 jobs by 2035 thing. It’s better than 0 jobs by 2035…

        smash and grab is what Jewish doing last century, Jews destroyed the element of western prosperity possible and at the same time looting white peopleproblem is Jews destroyed white people meaning are killing the golden goose
Corporate America no longer profitable because Jew changed the value that makes corporate profitableI see the Chinese corporation take all the business that Germany and America used to haveAnd Jew can’t get profit from it because Chinese are discriminate non-Chinese just like Jew did to non-Jews

        I think there is a lot of opportunity for young people today. There are openings for real engineering disciplines (chemical, electrical, mechanical, materials science) and it has never easier to become an airline pilot than it is today. What is hitting young people over the head is the huge costs associated with education, health care, and housing. The first two are the results of decades ofoligopolistic corruption and the latter a result of decades of FED cheap money induced asset inflation. All three of these must be rolled back, not only to save young people, but to save our society from certain collapse.

            Engineering pay is not that great unless one is able to find the rare good engineering job in a low-cost of living area.
The other problem with STEM jobs is that they tend to lack the intangible benefits that are found in fields like medicine, finance/business, and law.

                My younger brother got his degree in Mechanical engineering, his first job was basically working the phones for orders at a bearing company.  The old guys would call him on his day off to ask him questions about size and such.  He decided that was no path for him.

                    Excellent anecdote and point that I missed!
Underemployment is a danger for anyone in the STEM space.
I have found myself working as a glorified draftsman at points. Not a fun or satisfying place to be.

That’s what my son was doing with his Mechanical Engineering degree, too. Until one day he decided to get off his butt and take a chance with his own company. It wasn’t easy for them, no, because he was the sole income, but they got on solid footing several years faster than I did.

                The other problem with STEM jobs is that they tend to lack the intangible benefits that are found in fields like medicine, finance/business, and law.This certainly has not been my experience. On the contrary, physics has been a most satisfying path with both tangible and intangible benefits. When our company was bought out, I reaped the tangible benefits, though the salary up to that point had been more than satisfactory. Starting a new business also worked out. But our objective was always give priority to the F-word: fun. The business elements (hiring staff, getting business) were necessary evils, not intangible’benefits.’On the other hand, doctors I’ve known are simply drones working for large medical organizations. One guy I knew professionally who used to be a sole practitioner left medicine to become a mechanical engineer. He was pretty good at it.

            “I think there is a lot of opportunity for young people today.”Yes x100, but…There is also a lot of opportunity in China working at the Apple mega assembly campus #24 or third shift at Wells Fargo/ JPMorgan in central India.
I have young family members living in SF/ San Jose making well over $200k a year.  They are POOR and, if they remain, will not marry.
Ranch houses of $2 million plus private schools at $50k = terminal phase of mouse eutopia.

I have a nephew who flies corporate jets. Got his start straight out of high school. Amazon paid for his training, and now once he gets his job done, he’s basically free to fly anywhere he likes to get his hours up.
