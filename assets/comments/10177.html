        I am currently on holiday in the USA, driving from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. I can understand where major cities like Chicago or St. Louis may follow the progressive mentality, however from my observations, the rest of the country is so easily swayed.As I pass through hundreds of little towns off the main highways, it‚Äôs clear these people have little if anything in common with the progressives in the big cities. Chicago, IL has nothing in common with Davenport, MO and even in the poorest towns, American flags over car dealerships are the biggest I have ever seen. Mail boxes in rural back-roads are proudly decorated in Americana. Pick-up trucks promote gun ownership and the local high school football team. Even some of the most depressing and horrible mobile home tralier parks I have ever seen have American flags on display.The very German town of Hermann MO are very conservative and the people I spoke with are very patriotic and proud of America. I suspect this is true in hundreds of town just like it that dot the landscape. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I am sure there are not so many gay parades, anti-government riots or pro-immigrant rallies in cities like Hannibal, Quincy, or Jefferson CIty. Granted, mine is only a micro-view of a huge and incredibly vast country.The ‚ÄúProgs‚Äù you describe may have influence and hold on the major cities on either coast, but in my opinion, the major cities do not reflect the heartland of America or what Americans still value.When these progressive cities fail and collapse under the weight of their own failed policies, and some day I believe they will, it will be the heartland of your country that will continue to stand.

                    @ Uncle_Max ‚Äì Guest was correct. The Davenport I mentioned is in Iowa. I very much enjoyed the John Deere Pavilion across the Mississippi river in Moline. Amazing to climb up into one of those huge combines. Flood waters have been a challenge as I am taking back roads to avoid the major highways and have had to turn around on several occasions. However Route-66 is very nice!

        Islam is similarly territorial:  that land that was once under Islamic control ‚Äî dar al-Islam ‚Äî is theoretically never given up, and if lost, will again be delivered by God, or through conquest, or some such rubbish.

        I see is that future US politics will metaphorically be played out like Vietnam, only with the roles reversed. The progs will control all the media, the roads, infrastructure, and the major cities during the day. They will be road bound to dogma and their collectivism mindset will inhibit thinking outside the box, particularity as they become too comfortable living so well.The dirt people will control the flyover country and the night, and be as Mao put it, the fish who swim in the ocean of our enemy. Flexible and innovative, never staying put long enough t be pinned down. Like General Washington did, we will wear out our enemies chasing us.

            The asymmetry works in our favor, it‚Äôs true. Because the culture (at least outside of the internet memes) is controlled by the left, we learn about them and how they operate all day, in everything from human resources meetings to university lectures. Since we have to stay silent in public, we listen. And since they‚Äôre always talking, they never hear. The right consequently knows everything about the left. The left knows really nothing about the right.

        The GOPe has played along with the left‚Äôs ‚Äúheads I win, tails you lose‚Äù game because of a desire to maintain respectability ‚Äì of which the left‚Äôs media has been the arbiter.  The establishment right played along out of purely selfish individual motivations, as the rachet clicked and clicked, and previously acceptable groups became the new Hitler.  The cowards just kept taking additional steps leftward.This is why I see no need to temper my message when dealing with the left.  ‚ÄúHitler had some great ideas.  It‚Äôs a shame the jewish communists tried to kulak the Germans too, it left the goyim with no logical choice to fight back with equal brutality.‚Äù  The more inflammatory you are, the more sputtering the response.  When you don‚Äôt play their ‚ÄúMother may I?‚Äù game, they are powerless.  They never got those guns swept up ‚Äì what are they left with?  Trying to get you fired.  That‚Äôs ok, the American kulaks, Gen X and younger, are finding they have little left to lose.  And that makes for a dangerous foe indeed.  I hope the left goes full accelerationist. Let‚Äôs get it on.

        Progs will indeed burn everything before ceding anything. Their brinkmanship over Russia and the Crimea (already underway during the Obama years but amplified by Trump‚Äôs win) is the best example of this: like a child who would rather break his toy than risk having to share it with someone they don‚Äôt like, I think I can say without hyperbole that progs (and neocons) would be happier with nuclear annihilation than with admitting they were wrong or that they lost.I think some of this refusal to litigate goes back to what you noted about Obama as the SAT president. It‚Äôs not just, ‚ÄúWhat we have, we keep,‚Äù but ‚ÄúWe already filled in that bubble with a No. 2 pencil.‚Äù What it comes down to is that they just don‚Äôt believe in reality as an ultimate concept unless it produces results they like. Scott Adams is right; some literal hallucination is involved with the ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs Puppet‚Äù nonsense.

        By the way, the same ratchet effect occurs over public spending issues: if one party implements a 1% increase in some area, that can never, ever be reversed without mass protests and howls of outrage. No ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù law can ever be reversed either, as it immediately becomes a ‚Äúright‚Äù.When the Tories were laughably planning spending cuts in the UK, it would have taken public spending back to where it was around 2010-11. Yet everyone screamed blue murder that they were going to be throwing the most vulnerable on the streets to die. If people really believe this BS in enough numbers to keep voting the same class if idiots in, then I guess they deserve whatever is coming.

        When dealing with progs , do it the Spartan way ‚ÄúGive them nothing, take from them everything.‚Äù Than kick them into a bottomless pit
In truth Conservative people always face the disadvantage  of  actually wanting  to conserve things and fear chaos and madness whereas Leftist have no such limits
Maybe we just need to accept and interregnum of scotched earth ourselves , win or die.

        This is the failure of conservatism. It thinks it‚Äôs in an ideological fight, not a territorial one. Progs are in it for their peeps‚Äìto get them places to live and agencies to run and money to spend; conservatives are in it for their ideals. (‚ÄúAsk not what conservatism can do for you‚Ä¶‚Äù). The operational result is conservatives endlessly chase the Progressive advance, consolidating Progressive gains.
Death to conservatism!

        1. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a natural instinct, resulting from their obsession with the future. Their singular obsession is what they imagine to be the promised land that is just beyond the horizon. Any reconsideration of the past is the same in their mind as turning away from the future and marching backwards.‚Äù This is manifest destiny in the abstract. To them ideas and politics are like territory to the pioneer. And to hell with the natives. They aren‚Äôt the anointed ones like we are. Ignorant swine who need to be put down for the sake of advancing in history.2.  Experience vs ‚Äúresearch and reason‚Äù. This reminds me of various debates that have gone on. Climate change, Health Care, etc. We have statistics shoved in our faces every day that don‚Äôt make any sense when compared to our lived experience. They expect us to change the way we live based on a number set shoved in our faces by people who don‚Äôt give a shit about us and likely hate us. And we have begun to realize that those statistics have been gleaned from selected databases in ways in which the conclusions were preordained. Preordained. Just like the manifest destiny of ideas, laws, and territory. The imperialistic mindset never died, it just turned into progressivism.

        Like the Soviets, they benefit from the air of inevitability they both cultivate and unconsciously assume.  Of course the Soviet Union/Progressive Left will keep what it has won.  It‚Äôs Progress!  It‚Äôs Science!  Those things can‚Äôt change any more than the sun can retreat from its course through the day.But all that‚Äôs required is to disprove this assumption, and the whole thing starts to totter.  For me, it was the failed Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that marked the beginning of the end.  Suddenly the Red Army was no longer invincible.  Against all the cocksure assertions by Leftist apologists (many of them Western academics and media people) that communism could not be resisted, let alone defeated, were shown to be a lie.  THEY LOST.  And if they could lose in one place, they could lose in another.I think Berkley is the same turning point for Progressivism in America.  This wasn‚Äôt a case of ‚Äúdefeating‚Äù them with some lofty essay in NR ‚Äì it was on their own turf, using the tactics they‚Äôd supposedly perfected.  And down they went, to a ragged bunch of roustabouts who weren‚Äôt cowed by the inevitability of it all.Fatalism is deadly, and it‚Äôs not the Western tradition.  Remember in ‚ÄòLawrence of Arabia‚Äô, the Arabs are always shrugging and saying ‚ÄúIt is written‚Äù no matter what happens.  Lawrence is a different type, one who can do the seemingly impossible, and they finally admit that ‚ÄúFor some men, nothing is written.‚Äù

        ‚Äù hold the ground no retreat‚Äù  that sounds a lot like Hitler‚Äôs orders to his generals on the Eastern front.
To date holding their philosophical positions in the face of increasing middle-class dissatisfaction has cost the progressives quite a few state capitals and congressional representation .
This is the core of Donald Trump‚Äôs appeal he attacks the progressives sacred cows .  No prisoners, no prisoners.

                Karl, their strategy is not ‚Äùall or nothing,‚Äù it is compromise, take what they can get and ratchet one more gear tooth to the Left.  That idea was the entire point of Z‚Äôs essay, as I read it.  TruCons are happy if they keep 95% of what they had, and are willing to give up the other 5% to ‚Äúprove that the democratic process works.‚Äù  TruCons consider that a victory.

            The Republicrat nonsense doesn‚Äôt mean anything.  I have watched my state go from Yellowdog Democrat to Pub.  The state Pubs follow pretty much the same path that was laid out by Dems decades ago.  As far as Trump goes, he is pretty much to the left of, say, Hubert Humphrey.  Trump takes no prisoners?  Sorry, but what a joke that statement is.  The progs (and more important, prog thinking and prog assumptions) control all sides of the Political Establishment.  If you doubt that, consider the current Republican budget proposals.The progs always win because people like us leave the battlefield and go home when we think the war is won.  The progs never leave the field, never give up..

                Humphrey would never have nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. There is a lot of daylight between the two. The problem is in the senate.

        They are getting closer to stating their real position.  I‚Äôd be happier if they just came right out and said that their goal is to erase all human intellectual progress since the Enlightenment and memory hole Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, too.  The problem, as always is that by the time they do, it is too late.I cannot avoid thinking about piles of corpses whenever I read rubbish like the op-ed by Baer.  You could accuse me of a slippery slope argument, but if there is one thing that the 20th Century taught us is that nihilists armed with an absolutist ideology always end up at a pile of corpses.A very smart, successful guy once said in regards to another effort by progressive loons to seize power, ‚Äú70% are just normal people trying to get by.  You need to try to win them back.  25% are opportunists.  They will follow whoever is the strongest.  The remaining 5% are Leninist fanatics.  You need to kill them.‚Äù

        This is good summary of why conservatism has failed consistently since the end of WWII, except for the pleasant hiccup of the 1980‚Äôs. Whenever conservatism has enjoyed a momentary victory, as with Reagan‚Äôs presidency, or the Congressional takeover in 1994, it‚Äôs never sealed the deal. To use a football analogy, conservatism has a decent track record of moving the ball between the 20-yard lines, but it stinks in the Red Zone. That‚Äôs because Conservatives mistakenly believe that the great battle with the Progressives was some sort of Great Debate that they routinely won on points, and that once it was ‚Äúobvious‚Äù that their ideas had won, they could stop fighting, and settle back into their wingback chairs with a snifter of brandy.Progressives, however, as you‚Äôve pointed out several times, bear more resemblance to religious fanatics. They‚Äôre not interested in compromise, because how can there be any compromise to their Great Truth (whatever it happens to be this week)? There are retreats, there are even temporary setbacks. But Progressives never admit defeat, because it‚Äôs not a competition to them. It‚Äôs a jihad to bring about Paradise on Earth. And their mindset only allows two end games: complete victory or complete defeat.

        In WWI, the Germans/Central Powers *did* invade Russia in the winter and succeed.*  How_?  By cutting the Russian Empire off from external aid via their alliance with Turkey.  Once the Russians had to depend on their own resources, they were unable to ‚Äòpersist‚Äô.  Their elite demanded persistence but the common people ‚Äòvoted with their feet‚Äô, as Lenin said, and deserted the front en masse.  The Russian Civil war ensued which the Bolsheviks sorta won but the Russian elite clearly lost ‚Äòbigly‚Äô.How can this lesson be applied today vs. the Prog Empire_?  Cut it off from subsidy and make it‚Äôs enclaves live off their own resources, I‚Äôd say.  Time to zero base budget State U_!* In 1917 the US elite (temporarily) bailed out their war-credit debtors in Russia, France and England by throwing our resources fully onto their side of the balance.  But, of course, this was the beginning of the end for even the British and French Empires as well as those empires immediately perishing in 1918.

        Prog policies have good feelz, especially for women, but they are unsustainable to finance. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the progressive era coincided with the advent of centralized, fractional share banking, credit expansion, and ultimately ushered in the era of fiat currency and an exploding national debt. Productive members of society would rebel if they actually had to pay the costs of progressive policies.Prog policies will collapse when the dollar loses its status as the world‚Äôs reserve currency and we can no longer float the costs of progressive policies onto the global credit markets. Japan‚Äôs national debt is around 230% of its GDP. The US national debt is at about 100% of GDP. We still have 30-50 years before the math catches up.

            ‚ÄúProductive members of society would rebel if they actually had to pay the costs of progressive policies.‚ÄùProductive members of society have always had to pay the costs of progressive policies. And they have not rebelled. They have acquiesced because productive members of society already have a structure in place which they can understand. They can continue to work and provide for their families. Destroying this structure and creating a new one introduces chaos into their structure which is truly what they fear. There will come a time when too many productive individuals will be unable to be productive and support their lifestyle. Economic collapse is the only way to get these people to fight. They have always believed they had too much to lose. When they have nothing to lose, they will change.You seem to have some understanding of the interest bearing currency issue. Given that this follows a fairly consistent 75 to 80 year cycle, I really don‚Äôt think 30 to 50 more years is possible. We may already be in the initial period of the collapse. Japan‚Äôs debt to GDP is possible because of their homogenous society. Plus, America‚Äôs subsidy of their military defense. The US does not have the luxury of a single people. We are not ‚Äúone People‚Äù. We are many ‚Äúpeoples‚Äù. This adds additional stress towards the eventual collapse.

                I should have been more precise and stated ‚Äúfull cost‚Äù rather than just ‚Äúcost‚Äù of prog policies. My bad. We have the luxury of pushing a portion of these costs into the future, resulting in our $20T in debt. Without that luxury the tax rates necessary to support prog policies would cause a rebellion.

            The great trick of the modern economy is the seamless ability to socialize costs and privatize profits. That is made much easier via the credit economy. That‚Äôs how the rulers have kept the plates spinning for the last three decades. The side effects and the necessities, however, are creating cultural dislocation that may erode the system before the math catches up to it. Or, maybe not.

                Another thing that affects how long before the economy collapses is the engineered process of bringing debt free migrants into the country. This shows that the money ‚Äúchangers‚Äù value impoverished and ignorant individuals over productive White people that have an unsustainable debt load. They just put the new migrants on the debt treadmill and voila, they can keep the facade going. But, the issue is when will the economy collapse as far as Whites are concerned. More Whites than ever are unemployed and young Whites have fewer and fewer prospects. Pablo, with his $150,000 mortgage will not contribute as much as Joe Mayonnaise. When Whites quit contributing, the country will stop being a first world country.

                    I think you are on to something.  The issuers of credit are very predatory, no matter how they frame their work.  They get the up-front spiff from the credit transactions, and the longer term consequences of lending to people without real world skills or assets revert to the commons.  A version of the 2008 mortgage debt scenario.
Combine that with spreading around the spiff with all the mainstream political players, and the system becomes largely impervious to real change.

        My favorite part of that Leftist screed is referring to the hysterical shrieking, career destruction, lying, and actual physical attacks carried out in order to establish the current Victim Culture as ‚Äúphilosophical work‚Äù. Also, you will note that the Lefty‚Äôs anecdote about ‚ÄúShoah‚Äù makes exactly the opposite point as he is trying to defend. The director was saying that reason and facts trumps personal trauma; The Lefty is maintaining the exact opposite.

        The only value of a parasite in society is that they occasionally enable decomposition and decay by killing the host. Beyond that, they have nothing to offer but endless need. And their need to preserve their feeding spot on the host is existential, hence the desperation to cling to every vestige of ground gained. They will not yield, because to yield is to die.

        And there you have half of the Progressive m/o.  First, never demand everything you want all at once. Take only what you think you can get. You know, the easy, common sense measures that *everybody* can, or should, agree on. Second, once you get that, never, EVER take a step back. Never.  Consolidate your gains at all costs, then demand a little bit more.  Lather, rinse, repeat, until you reach your end game.  The NRA understands this which is why they budge not.one.inch. on ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù gun control measures.
