        Late comment here, but seriously I read about Sharpton being an FBI informant around 20 years ago. It was in, I think, either Vanity Fair or Esquire and might have been a piece on the Tawana Brawley fiasco. One quote I can remember is that his FBI handlers “regarded Sharpton as a pure con”.
