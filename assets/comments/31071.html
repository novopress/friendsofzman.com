        Obama:
‘All of this is taking place against the backdrop of decades of failure to achieve a durable peace for both Israelis and Palestinians
‘I look at this and I think back, ‘What could I have done during my presidency, to move this forward?’ as hard as I tried. I’ve got the scars to prove it.
OOOh the scars!

            Is it that Obama and his minions are just so petty that they have to blow up the middle east up because they are still mad that Trump brought peace through strength to that part of the world?
They have to blow everything up trying to make us forget that Trump’s term even existed and how things went when he was in charge? How he made things they said were impossible, possible.

        The Z-Man wrote, earlier in the thread:A million years ago when I was a teenager, I would volunteer for political candidates. I had a part-time job with a congressman, so I would often be asked to volunteer for certain things.That is an interesting anecdote. It certainly sheds more light on some of your subsequent attitudes and helps to explain why you became so cynical about the system. You seem to have had an unusual life as a youngster.When I was a teenager, I would have been mortified at the idea of a congressman even knowing who I was and seeing my wretched, dysfunctional family and my falling-down-drunk parents. Being poor and uncouth, growing up in a trailer park in the dusty plains of northern Colorado, I would have avoided important people out of sheer embarrassment (not that I knew any, anyway).In any case, my mind was a thousand miles away from electoral politics at that time. My vague impression was that it was it was entirely staffed by lunatics, and trying to follow along with made my head hurt. When I would read the editorial pages, for instance, and listen to some local newspaper staffer pontificate about a transient policy issue, I would wonder what bizarre mindset these people operated from. Neither their affected sense of urgency nor their incomprehensible proposals ever seemed believable to me.I ended up seeing this as a symptom of a class divide. Only rich, well-educated white kids who grew up in the suburbs utterly removed from any harshness, could possibly turn into the kind of adults who obsessed over policy minutiae and argued using an endless repertoire of utterly random factoids with no metaphysical coherence. People who would one day be citing John Locke and the next day citing John Donne, or who move effortlessly from Oliver Holmes to Oliver North, using whatever statements are convenient for them at the moment (George Will does this stuff all the time), are infuriating to a young man just looking for some direction in life. Being older and being used to it, it’s easy to forget just what a cacophonous stream of nonsense our punditry class is responsible for.Perhaps I understand something of why black people and Hispanics tend to look at our political system and sweepingly disregard it as “some stupid white people thing.” I have always felt that way myself, and they’re not wrong.

Sorry to hear that, ID, and I know that you’re not trawling for pity.  Your backstory adds depth to your posts.

            In my teenage years, my only interest in politics was to secure status among my maternal extended family, almost all of whom–including my mom–were Leftists. Moreover, these people were quite bright, and I concluded therefrom that if one were to be an intellectual, one had to be a Leftist. And given that I had aspirations along those lines, my political views tacked decidedly leftward. Alas, it wasn’t until late in my undergraduate days, say roughly 1992 and at the age of 24, that I began to jettison Leftism. And it wasn’t until 2010 that I became a race realist. In the present, I’m gradually shedding my devotion to the free market. Quite the odyssey.

                That’s very interesting, Ostei. I always enjoy hearing more about where people are coming from, although understandably people want to avoid completely doxing themselves. Congratulations on your ongoing journey.

                    Do our views become better, i.e. more accurately aligned with reality, over time? Is one fundamentally wiser at the age of 56 than he was at 16? It stands to reason–so to speak. But AINO, and the Left in general, behaves as if the opposite were true. Another feature of the Satanic Inversion, I suppose.
The best of luck to you, ID, on your path to greater wisdom.

                        I suspect that decent men drift away from leftism as adults because they start gaining the life experience to see that all the victim people they were taught about in school largely have only themselves to blame.  That just leaves sociopathic men willing to say anything to maintain social status and women vulnerable to appeals to empathy.

                        Ploppy: “leftism… sociopathic men willing to say anything to maintain social status and women vulnerable to appeals to empathy…”I would strongly consider flipping around the sexes, and rearranging the analysis to look something like the following…“leftism… sociopathic women willing to say anything to maintain social status and men vulnerable to appeals to empathy”Although Jack Dodson had an excellent insight on Friday: “The last I saw less than five percent have taken the new and improved vaccine—which if correct means even Covid-wearing Karen has refused it.”https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=31071#comment-376604That would tend to indicate that the V@xxines of Death are casting such a dark pall over our civilization that even the sociopathic Karens are starting to reassess their outlook on things.Of course they’ll never admit to it.But the Karens can’t un-see all the deaths around them [especially all the miscarriages &amp; stillbirths &amp; little league football heroes dropping dead on the field of play].Sociopathy meets DEATH.Guess who wins?PS: The empathetic men ain’t gonna be nearly so empathetic if the ChiComs succeed in launching a massive EMP first strike against us, destroying our food-making &amp; food-refrigeration &amp; food delivery systems.Status post an EMP event, the once oh so empathetic men will all be struggling not to starve to death, and any sh!tliberal pretensions of empathy will long since have been jettisoned.https://canadafreepress.com/article/how-china-will-punch-out-our-lights

            I grew up in a one-parent household, which was the offspring of a paternal and maternal one-parent household, both of which were filled with drunks, gamblers, draft-dodgers, rusties, and louts.Still, I managed to read some books while a teenager, unlike you and your virtue-signalling blacks and latinos, with whom you (naturally) identify, and which — of course — makes you a superior person, for identifying with the footstools of our society.Your comments always seem to redound upon how special you are compared to others. Here we a comment in which you — stupid, young, ignorant — are still better than others, who managed to apply themselves and rise above their circumstances at the very same moment in which you were mired in mediocrity.What makes you think you’ve escaped it?Only someone with a background such as yours — who is still butthurt about it — would write a comment such as this. And since you’re an “intelligent Dasein,” perhaps you already know what the word ressentiment means in Nietzsche, and how your comments instantiate that notion.

        Has anyone seen the pic of Johnson when he first “adopted” that black? Major cuck vibes. Thinking of Johnson’s weird hairlessness makes me think of a line from one of the greatest works of literature, The Canterbury Tales: “I judged he was a gelding or a mare.”

            OBVIOUS &amp; UNDENIABLE GAY PAEDO FACE.Not even debatable.Johnson wanted that shiny young big black buck in his household for a reason.The greatest socio-political shock of muh life, maybe even bigger than realizing the abject horror of the JQ itself, the biggest shock was coming to terms with the fact that the GOP was the party of the s0d0mites, versus the DEMs, which were the party of masculine satyrs.Anyone who would have hypothesized such a dichotomy to me, circa my childhood, would have struck me as being an abject lunatic.But we can’t deny it anymoar.GOPers molest little boys.DEMs molest little girls.It’s the way of the world.

        This is one of your best podcasts ever. It clearly explains that the system is broken and cannot be repaired via voting harder because everyone sucked into the DC toilet bowl is eventually contaminated or compromised by larger forces endemic to the managerial cancer that has evolved there. This is not a trivial problem and there is no redemption to be had via wordism and attempted persuasion of the masses.I would argue that there really is no viable solution to the problem as it currently manifests. We are on a collision course with collapse and only that outcome can trigger a remedy. Yes, most folks are not hardy enough to survive the collapse, so burying your head in the sand is preferable to facing reality. And that culling is actually part of the cure. But this path does not have to end in catastrophe. There is a more humane alternative that gives rise to a quick bounce off the bottom. That is the proper place to put one’ efforts and aspirations.

        That’s a great study, there was another one like it that came a while ago that showed people living under dictatorships in the third world had a lot more say over their societies than western democracies. Unfortunately I lost the link &amp; can’t find it for the life of me nor can I find the since banned youtube video discussing it. Not that it matters, it’s like the existence of gravity in that I don’t need a study to confirm what I can observe with my own eyes &amp; anyone who needs a source to confirm it isn’t worth talking to.

            I remember reading something along those lines, the explanation being that democracies shift the blame for bad policies onto the voters, while dictators need to maintain the idea that they are the authority and thus responsible for policy.  You see this all the time in the Anal Empire, when something goes wrong and they can’t spin it into a positive it’s always the collective “we” at fault.  For example, the neocon middle east wars and the covid hysteria are framed as mass psychoses coming from the public rather than the stupid decisions of the elites.

To be fair, mass psychosis was significantly responsible for the covid hysteria. If first world people weren’t such cowardly, gullible softies, the Power Structure wouldn’t have been able to perpetrate the fraud.

                    Yeah but the mass psychosis isn’t grassroots, it’s generated by the elites.  For covid you had that goblin Fauci on the electric Jew every night telling the cattle how then needed to bathe in hand sanitizer.

                        TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, hand sanitizer was all that was needed.Covid*** proved to be like all other respiratory viruses; it wasn’t transmitted via aerosols; it was transmitted via HAND-TO-MOUTH contact.Or hand-to-nose, or hand-to-eye.Point being that if you simply washed your hands on a regular basis [and didn’t pick your nose or suck your thumb or rub your eyes], COVID posed no threat to you whatsoever.==========***I have a lot of sympathy for Andrew Anglin’s thesis, which holds that likely there never was a novel virus in the first place; that plain old-fashioned influenza flu was simply re-branded, via a massive psy-op [the likes of which we haven’t seen since Pearl Harbor], with the ultimate purpose being to trick the citizenry into submitting to the depopulationist v@xxines, which will, over time, sterilize and/or mμrder almost all of those who were j@bbed with the v@xxines.Also, the entire Medical Industrial Complex turned UP the pressure on the ventilators, which blew out the lungs of the elderly, and by mμrdering hundreds of thousands of elderly Amurrikkkuns, saved Scr0tial Security &amp; Medicμnt billions upon billions of dollars per year.If we had simply told people to wash their hands, and told doctors to turn DOWN the pressure on the ventilators [or to not intubate in the first place], then the 2020/2021 flu season would have been a great big Nothing Burger, and no one would have ever even noticed it.But that’s the power of psyops.All must bow before the almighty Psyop.==========The recent data on the v@xxines continues to be horrible, and continues to indicate rising rates of myocarditis, death, miscarriage and stillbirth amongst what otherwise should have been healthy Amurrikkkun children &amp; young adults &amp; newborns.I haven’t seen any good news whatsoever concerning the V@xxpocalypse.Just horrifying news upon horrifying news upon horrifying news.It’s such uniformly awful news that I don’t even much feel like going Chicken Little on people anymoar.Horrifyingly awful outcomes are now the New Normal in Klownworld.

Mike Johnson has far &amp; away the strongest and moast undeniable case of Gay Paedo Face that I’ve ever seen in a GOP congressman.
He makes Lindsey Grahamnesty look positively masculine by comparison.
There isn’t a doubt in my mind as to why Mike Johnson wanted to have an handsome young 14 year old nubian buck in the household.

With regards to rebranding, the giveaway was that there were 40,000,000 reported cases of Flu the year before the Coff.
The first year of the Coff? 3,600 cases reported.
It was a Christmas miracle!
One wonders why anyone needs a Flu shot, since it’s been eliminated.
If the government or MSM said the sun rose in the east, I would have to confirm it for myself.

On a long enough timeline, and if left to its own devices, Passive Aggression will eventually destroy the entirety of Creation.

        The enemy is always ready to take advantage of any opportunity which might present itself.  They make their own luck.  When the banks started failing in 08, they had the libertarian types sitting in the wings waiting to take advantage of the anger people had at the bank bailouts and obscene bonuses for wrecking the economy. They were swept into office in 2010 and then did absolutely nothing other than stupid clown shows with the debt ceiling.  I recall out of nowhere, the media started doing segments on how suddenly popular Ayn Rand’s (Alisa Zinov’yevna Rosenbaum) books were and how only the rich could save us.If the system starts showing cracks again, they’ll have all the people in place for the rerun of the 2010 clown show episodes.It all goes back to why they like democracy in the first place.  The people are gullible, they are ignorant, they don’t know who to blame and will generally do as they are told. They have a vast propaganda network to direct the people to do things that serve the interest of the oligarchs.  Wash, rinse, repeat…..

            Public trust and confidence has collapsed now. That is the fundamental difference from 2007. Ruling by force is about the only option for them to maintain power, in the event that has never really been the case.

        The American system of government was constructed to serve the financial elites. In the old days, the elite were the Southern slave owners and the Northern commercial elite. The civil war eliminated the Southern branch and brought to power the Northern industrialists and their party, the Republicans. The Depression ended the Republican reign and brought a new managerial elite to power in both business and government, with the Democratic Party as their main political vehicle. A major difference in the old and the new elite is their attitude towards the American people. The old elite had a connection to the people that was nationalist and not merely financial. The new elite is anti-nationalist, loathes the American people and works tirelessly for their demoralization and replacement with a new, servile, imported class of cheap laborers.There is no effective political opposition to this elite, as they control the political money spigot both parties depend on. Republicans pay lip service to various populist or conservative positions but their hearts are not in it.

It has to be more complicated than that. In brief, this society, America, is a consumer based society.  We work to buy crap.  Our replacements are low level, subsistence farmer types.  IQ follows, then productivity.  Who are the elites going to lord over when the society turns brown?  Who is going to buy what they produce?

        If the system selects for conformists, I’m for diversity hires, because their biological nature cannot conform to the standards the elites need to run anything. White nationalist should play the ‘fink’ game on Washington. Say the slogans and be the white guy who hires uneducated black/hispanic/lefty masses to run the electrical grid for example. Fire every single capable white dude in any organization that runs the system and let the real show begin. If someone asks about it, say they are racist bigots. Before the whole thing callapses, loot the treasury and donor money, live off grid and watch the sunset while the cities burn.

            “Say the slogans and be the white guy who hires uneducated black/hispanic/lefty masses to run the electrical grid for example.”The government itself is enforcing that already, I work in construction &amp; in order to even be allowed to bid on infrastructure contracts you have to hit a diversity quota. Meanwhile all the state run utility companies where I live are basically only hiring brown people, particularly the underprivileged “yoof.” They even have “pograms” to hire these people right out of high school or more accurately once they get their GED.Currently what this amounts to in practice is having a bunch of black guys standing around getting paid to do nothing because they’re so incompetent they’ll fuck things up. Better to pay them to do nothing than risk them costing more by doing damage. That’s the laborers though, the truck drivers hauling asphalt &amp; dirt is an unavoidable disaster. All of them have a comically high turnover rate since none of them can show up on time or at all but especially the drivers. Them not showing up is the optimal scenario, no risk involved. Worst case scenario is them doing insanely stupid things like leaving truck beds up taking out highway signs, flipping trucks &amp; driving like they’re in the NASCAR with 50 ton loads in their beds. The black man still hasn’t grasped the concept of of physics &amp; momentum I’m afraid. Can’t even trust them to drive things like bobcats without watching them like a hawk because they’ll drive right into what’s basically quicksand mud &amp; sink them. Women hires are like this to a lesser degree as well with a quintuple increase if it’s a black woman. The noises black women make when they do something stupid is admittedly comical though, they’re not used to anyone having authority over them or hearing the word “no.”When boomers go &amp; the government ratchets up the diversity quotas even harder &amp; starts demanding executive positions things are going to go off the rails entirely. There’s just simply no way to maintain society when you’re putting bantu in charge of repairing &amp; building infrastructure. For a glimpse of what that looks like take a look at Detroit, looking at that city is essentially peering through a crystal ball into the future.One upside to the diversity push is the advent of trannies, there’s been race quotas for ages but now women &amp; sexual freaks are included. Once my job is threatened I’m going to claim I was actually a woman this whole time &amp; say I just present as a very convincing male. Who can say I’m not actually a tranny? I’m encouraging everyone else to do the same when the time comes, can’t be trans racial but thanks to the new diversity categories it doesn’t matter anyway.

                I’ve been watching this show called Bargain Block about 2 gay white guys that go around fixing up houses in Detroit, and selling them, and my initial reaction every episode is “why aren’t black people doing this?”, but then of course physics and calculus rear their ugly heads…

        Damn, I had forgotten (mission accomplished there, Deep State) about the FBI agent caught shaking down Gaetz’s father. That explains why Gaetz was bulletproof enough to sack McCarthy, even if the replacement is essentially a clone. Does anyone know what came of that extortion attempt? I am certain there were no criminal penalties or even a job loss but would like to see how it was handled if anyone has a link.As for Z’s larger point about team players and managerialism, just note how many congressmen or senators ever have uttered Jeffrey Epstein’s name. The complete silence says it all. There never will be a congressional committee even go through a sham hearing about such matters and anyone who tries will be destroyed.

        I remember getting involved in college 30 years back.  I was a Reagan republican at the time, naive, and believed in the whole system.  I sheepishly admit I did college republicans and campus crusade for christ. The first major shock I received was in freshman English where a professor happily proclaimed that America would soon be a white minority country.  He went on to talk about the virtues of communism and the evils of whites and western culture.  So I fought back, as ignorantly as I could, with all of the inconsistencies typical of my background.  It would be another decade before I could get that sorted out.  But the second shock was how impotent college republicans were.  Complaints about the LGBT alliance or professorial misconduct were ignored, and heaven forbid that they might organize to actually do something.  It existed precisely as Z stated – to sort through the youth and provide cannon fodder for the system.One more point.  The managerialism seems to be far more prominent in the right than on the left.  Leftie groups are constantly working to expand the scope and breadth of mission, to take on new causes, to organize and to educate.

            southpol, you’re clearly a good guy.  I wish that we had a system that could have put all your youthful idealistic energy to good use.
Your story reminds me of the rise of the Log Cabin Republicans, from painful embarrassment to pride of the GOP, from the 80s to the present.  (And while most of my affection for Lincoln has faded, their very name is a slander against the man.)

        Z makes a convincing argument that the system of government that we live under selects those who support it.  That makes complete sense as does the observation that it exists for those in power, not for rank and file Americans.The issue at hand then is what can be done about it beyond awareness, and that has largely been my largest complaint with much of the DR: I don’t want to merely document the fall.   I have been fairly well convinced by the libertarians that localism is the way forward but I see little evidence that is occurring here.  Lately I’ve followed this South African guyhttps://www.youtube.com/@briekmerke/videosand am intrigued at the suggestion to “go back to your tribes”.  I struggle with that because I see so little evidence of tribe affiliation at least with whites, as they have ingested the creedalist view.  I would appreciate Z or others opinion on this.

            This may sound cruel, but in my opinion, no more than 25 percent of white “Americans” are salvageable. This is the “remnant.” The rest are so stupid, debased and fundamentally traitorous that they do more harm than good.

                I have come to a similar conclusion.  COVID hysteria, single motherhood, the LGBT movement, the Israel above all else “conservatives”, and feminism has shown there are a ton of whites who are incapable of critical thought and possess no capacity for the healthy tribalism necessary to overcome what is coming.  America in general produces obese, degenerate mutts of whites.  We need wolves, but they aren’t produced in AINO..

            Nothing at all can be done about it, southpoll, because there is exactly one solution and nobody can talk about that solution. We can support our guys some, but the idea that anyone can retreat to some place and tribe up is nonsense on stilts.

        OT, and a response to Compsci, from a day or two ago. He had a question about teardrop tattoos on individuals.As one who hired a fellow with said tats on his face,(I was young and naive, I know), I asked him what they meant. Without hesitation, he explained that the ones that are just the outline, mean they had a loved one, or homie, killed by someone.The filled in ones meant that the wearer actually killed someone.He had both.He explained he eliminated the individual who killed his brother.I then told him that the drywall waiting to be hung wasn’t gonna get to the second floor by itself.That was long ago, during another life.Was he lying to me? Who knows.Hope that helps.

            It does help, thanks.  BTW for the record/extension, I moved homes about 8 years ago upon retirement.  The first big purchase was a huge safe for the garage, made to my design and ordered from an out of state firm.  Problem was I did not realize what such a monster required to get it delivered, then dragged up a hill, and placed into the garage—1+ ton safes do not move themselves.A local moving company, then currently under multiple indictments for typical moving company shenanigans, was the only company willing to handle the move and install.  (What can go wrong?)   They sent their best gorillas out,  all Hispanic, one an obvious gang member (obvious prison tattoos—tears and all).  It literally took all four of us to push this thing into final position.The Hispanic gang member looked at the safe in the corner and stated it was not “square” with the walls.  We were exhausted, but he insisted we take a few runs at it to push it the extra half inch or so to square it up.  (By runs, I mean we all ran and hit it simultaneously—think HS football drill.)Point being, he looked like he got out of prison yesterday—you’d piss you pants if he stared at you—he was built like a Mack truck.  However he was pretty decent at his job and cared for detail—even with an Anglo client.  After that, I began to think a bit differently about folk with scary tattoos.  (However, I also changed the combo on the safe for good measure.).  😉

                Well, there is still a bit of conquistador floating around in the genes of the Hispanic peoples.
Also, even though their human sacrificial practices were awful, the Aztec, Maya, and Inca were able to build some impressive large-scale structures.

                    Very little I would think. The real conquistadores themselves were very few in number. Considering them a separate category from colonists who came after.

                        Funny you should note the sparsity of Conquistadors compared to the Aztec’s.  Just reading at UNZ, “Did We Steal America from the Indians?”  by Jef Costello.Of course Jef discusses how the Indians mostly slaughtered themselves for centuries before the White man came to show them “how it’s really done”.  😉  Jef mentions how the Leftists refuse to acknowledge intratribal warfare and land take over prior to the discovery of America.Well, the conquistadors conquered the Aztecs by allying with tribes the Aztecs had defeated and therefore had old scores to settle with the “empire”.  Perfect example that Jef could have drawn upon.

                I’ve always wondered if there was an art to getting a big ass safe delivered and installed without the whole neighbourhood (not to mention the installers and retailer) knowing that you’re a good candidate for home invasion.
Apparently not, short of doing what they did when they buried stone age kings, early Chinese emperors, etc.

                    There is benefit to living in an outlying area and upon a hill.  People look up and see very little.  But your point is well taken, home invasion is the one thing difficult to prevent–passively anyway. Safe will survive burn down and physical attacks–short of explosives.  Whether I’d open it at the point of a gun is another question (unanswered).

            One of the funniest human beings I’ve ever known was a Messkin named Benny Chavez who had, in his youth, been convicted of murder. Worked with him in a dry cleaners back in ’95 and ’96. He wasn’t tatted up, BTW.

        If there’s one “positive” to the Johnson speakership it’s that it’s brought out into the open how much Christians, or the wrong kind of Christians, are hated in this economic zone. That mask is off. Nobody can pretend anymore. I like it when everybody puts their cards on the table.
I bet the shitlibs weren’t expecting the “maga extremists” to come to the defense of Ms. Tlaib the other day. It is a time of shifting alliances.

        Real world examples are always enlightening so here’s one. (Names and locations have been slightly altered to protect, well, me.)Debbie, 30, is a mother who works for the Arlington County school system. She’s a very liberal Democrat who volunteers on a various campaigns, both local and state. Debbie, who now knows some of the local politicians and party officials, decides that she wants to run for school board.Dems always win spots on the school board, but you still need to get your name out – and that means money and help from the Dem party. So, she’d need around $60,000 to run the campaign and the party apparatus to get access to volunteers, media, local clubs, churches, synagogues, etc. Obviously, every candidate needs the money and the party organization. Even current school board members could be in trouble without the cash and help.In essence, Debbie needs the approval of the local Dem party officials. Luckily, they’ve known her for several years and she’s shown herself to be one of them, so they give her the money and the organizational help.Debbie runs for school board, doing all the demeaning things that you need to do (gladhanding, going to countless breakfasts, church meetings, business functions, fairs, parades, etc.) to win office. You have to really want to be in office. Luckily, Debbie wins and over two terms proves that she is 100% on board with the party line and won’t rock the boat.Now, Debbie wants to run for state representative since the current rep is running for something higher. Again, it’s a 90% Dem area, but she’ll still need at least $150k (or more) to get her name out and, of course, lots of organizational help from the Dem party. (Btw, if this was a competitive race, she’d needs multiples of that to run, but my point is that even in non-competitive races, the candidate needs far more money than they could raise on their own.)Since Debbie has proven herself to be a loyal party member, the Dem party – which likely picked her as the candidate, i.e., she didn’t go to them, they went to here because they knew the current rep was moving on – gives her the money and party organizational help.My point to this little, but true, story is that the vetting starts very early and there’s almost no avenue to even very low-level political offices that doesn’t go through the party and the donors. No where in this story did I mention the voters, because they don’t matter. What matters is the party and the donors who work hand in hand. They control access to the political offices.That is our political system, and the higher you go, the more tightly controlled it is. In a few years, Debbie will run for state senate, maybe even for Congress. By that point, she will have more than 20 years of vetting and proving that she’s one of the managerial class. She’ll also know no other way of life than being a politician, which she obviously loves because she’s willing to get through so much shit to get there.Voting is putting your stamp of approval on this system.

            Yes but the question is – how much of this is legit, C? Far be it for me to defend donks and libs… but in this case, vetting is entirely legitimate and warranted. Our blog host recommends the same for Dissidents: don’t partner up with crazy people, don’t allow any guy off the street into your circle, etc. The donks are doing exactly what they should – vetting their people.In point of fact, it is we conservative minded folks that have dropped the ball. We should have turfed cretins like Mitch McConnell, Lindsay Graham, etc.The more I think about this, the more the Speaker Of The House flap looks like a win for me. Despite the system, the procedures, and the fixing – Kevin McCarthy got kicked to the curb – on THEIR playing field, by THEIR rules, against their bought-and-paid-for players. It must have cost them millions – but such amounts are only chump change. The fact is – there are holes in the system, and they are only going to widen. Antisemitism, Dissident thought – it’s going mainstream.Terrance Popp on OyTube has a black belt in what he calls, “administrative violence” where by using the same tactics they use on us – we could use on them and turn the system against itself. Perhaps we should start thinking about substantial ways of doing this?

                You make a good point. Vetting is just something that any good organization does. And, yes, we should do it as well.My point was simply that voting is pointless. The real voting happened long before and by the managerial class.As to tactics, I’d love if we could organize and fight back like any other group, but that ship has sailed. We let people who hate and fear us take over the system. They won’t let rise within or take on that system in the same that we stupidly let them.We’ll have to work outside the system – very quietly – until the system starts to show cracks and gives us openings to more openly build our own communities and systems.

                Yeah, what’s the alternative?  My one thought was some sort of testing system where anyone seeking a specific office has to take a test and voters would then have an out-of-band factoid on which to chose candidates, but it’s hard to see how something like that wouldn’t get corrupted (“oh look, all my candidates scored 1000%)
Anyway, none of this would even matter if the system wasn’t actively doing it’s level best to genocide us.

            One problem here with running for office is that candidates are limited wrt solicitation of funds from individuals.  Here it used to be a few hundred dollars, now it’s been increased to a few thousand.  However, organizations can set up PAC’s with *no* limit as to contributions and expenditures!  The only limit is that you can’t coordinate with them as a candidate.  Ostensibly you both can’t communicate on expenditures in your run for office.  (If you believe that.)So an organization such as the Democratic Party with large amounts of $$$ and savvy become much more important than the rank and file voter.  This next election will be no different.  Listen to the ad’s and read the mailings and look/listen for the “disclaimer” as to who’s paying for this ad.

        I took one look at Johnson and could immediately tell that he’s just another McCarthy.He’s not necessarily a bad man. He would be great as a farm manager maybe, or maybe own a successful jet ski dealership. He looks like he would be a good, active member of the Flock at his local mega church. And raising 5 kids is impressive.But he’s not the man who will fight against the Deep State. He’s not the kind of man who’s even aware that a Deep State exists, or of a need to fight it. He’s not the kind of man who thinks about demographics – we’re all God’s children after all. He is the kind of man who will sign whatever GOPe bills are put on his desk, and not think too much about it.Overall, a productive, decent member of society with good values. Great guy to have on your team. Not the guy to take charge against a cabal of baby eating demon worshippers.

The system selects its types, no matter the facade.  Mike may be a ‘decent’ guy, but he is fully invested in the system.  His political views are, at heart, little different than David French.

                    3g touches on the elephant in the room.  I haven’t listened to Z Man’s podcast yet, so maybe he mentions this, but Johnson and his wife adopted a teenage black boy when they were in their twenties.  Even by cuckservative Christian standards this is weird.
Let’s hope that David French’s white savior virtue preening is all that is going on here and not something more sordid!

            Fair point. However, in a so-called democracy, what sort of person seeks to become a politician? In the main, power-mad maniacs who will say and do anything to gain power and even more to retain it. As a general rule of “democracy,” anybody who gets elected, shouldn’t.

                Our political system would be a million times better if all positions were held by a mandatory lottery for everyone with an IQ over 115.  Mandatory as in if you get selected you don’t get to say no: the reason our juries are terrible is because only retards and the elderly have the time to sit through a trial and wont’ find a way to weasel out of it.

        My old senator, James Lankford (R-OK), was a super-Christian too. “Christian” in quotes mind you. Oh, I’m sure he’s a fairly kind and civilized man and reads scripture and tries to do what he think Jesus would do. But I don’t know how you can pretend to be a Christian and literally serve Moloch.But I suppose all those “Christian Conservatives” have been starstruck by the waving flag and military visits and GOP insiders and mainstream journalists like all the other tools in DC. The only difference being the CCs think that voting harder plus reading the BAHBULL harder will make the USA 1994 again. (Without Clinton, though.)

            I fail to understand how the hardcore “Christians” can be so fanatically devoted to Israel and to wars in the Middle East.I was raised Catholic, and Catholics hardly ever read the Bible. When I finally read it (and understood it) it became obvious to me that the basic foundational principle of Christianity is the rejection of Judaism. The entire Old Testament is a litany of murders committed by Jews against their enemies, allegedly sanctioned by (and in cases like Passover, committed by) God.The Sanhedrin had Christ tortured to death because he rejected the idea that Jews were “God’s Chosen people” and insisted that any righteous man could be saved by God.I cannot understand how millions of fundamentalist Protestants who scrutinize the Bible and can quote practically any chapter and verse by memory cannot see this. They literally do not see the forest for the trees. The Israel-centric version of fundamentalist Christianity is basically a heresy.Although there are many criticisms that can be made of the Roman Catholic church, it can at least be said in defense of it that the pre-Vatican II clergy understood that the relationship between Christianity and Judaism is fundamentally antagonistic.

                They literally do not see the forest for the trees.This. But they have been massively gaslit. Keith Woods has a good Twitter thread about it…he says it comes from the Scofield Bible crowd, and Scofield was bankrolled by a Zionist named (((Untermayer))).Though I have even heard my Orthodox priest say “Judeo-Christian” a number of times, so Untermayer’s tentacles have even infiltrated my beloved church.As for Orthodox as a whole, and maybe some Orthobros can correct me, it seems they “play nice” with Jews and Muslims…because they have to. That tends to happen when 4/5ths of your patriarchal cities are controlled by Jews or Muslims. Moscow is the unofficial 6th city and I suspect Patriarch Kyril would be the most chauvinist of Christian leaders.

What do you mean? It clearly says in Genesis that God blesses those who bless “Israel”, and “Israel” is the name of our Greatest Ally. Same thing.

                Well Evangelicals are the same morons who think that praying will lead to material wealth.  Apparently they just skimmed the cliff’s notes on Job.  It’s just as dumb as Jews thinking that they’re tricking God by hiring a Shabbas Goy to flip their light switches for them.

        How it works, huh?Z… I have some muddled thoughts that raise questions for me. I am unhappy with this idea where Washington is Smurf Village where all the players scratch each other’s backs, secret handshakes all round, money’s passed under tables in brown envelopes, and the sun always shines.In an environment with that much power and money, surely, there has to be rivalries, greed, back stabbing, treachery and all the other fun stuff you’d see in a medieval king’s court? At least – I would think so.How do they maintain the equilibrium required for your explanation? Hell’s bells – the friggin JEWS are at each other’s throats half the time. For me…something just isn’t adding up. I guess what I’m trying to say is that There’s not nearly enough friction in your theoretical model.How do they avoid the inevitable turf wars?

This may be true, but when push comes to shove, they will always side with the Jews against everyone else.  They will also bribe, blackmail or coerce everyone else to side with the Jews.
Whites, in contrast, are punished if they show any in-group preference or dare to suggest making our own citizens a priority, as opposed to sending buckets of billions overseas. Remember when the Republican voters were reliably informed that we couldn’t afford 5 billion for a border wall? Pepperidge Farm remembers.

                Almost every member of the tribe, regardless of their political party, agrees on massive immigration and protecting Israel over America.  In general, they agree on dispossessing traditional Americans, even if they wouldn’t describe their position as such.
When I was a conservative, the first glimpse that I got of this was when the conservative radio host, Michael Medved, supported Bush’s amnesty plans, in spite of angry opposition from most of his listeners.  He couldn’t help himself.

                    Not saying any of you guys are wrong. No doubt, you largely have the right of it. By modern definitions I AM an antisemite – and proudly so – but for me, the math and logic has to add up.Consider your point here: hypothetically – suppose you’re a jew. And you decide to replace whites with third world human trash. Why would you invite in swarms of violent, stupid muslims that hate you and want to kill you? The other race morons are similarly liabilities. Chit skinned Morons are bad for business. They don’t work, they can’t think, and cannot abide stable govts. You’d be far better off cultivating and developing ties with white people.There are pieces that don’t fit into the puzzle. What am I missing here?

That, and the Chosenites fear that, once their aggressions and transgressions were to become widely known here, it’ll potentially be game over for them here, and just when Isn’tReal is driven to the wall or even destroyed. I mean, who would want to be saddled with being #110 after the sordid display they have put on here, in the place that gave them the best shake they will ever likely get, and they just blew it out their asses?

                        @JerseyJeffersonian“The power of hate is what you are missing.”As soon as I read Filthie’s question, I resolved to answer it with verbiage nearly identical to your own, then I read your comment.I call this the ‘stupidly nice white people’ phenomenon. (not calling you stupid, Filthie, we are ALL guilty of this; it’s our way) We don’t hang on to unforced hatreds like most non-Europeans do. Hatred for us invariably has a recent cause and fades fairly quickly when the reason ceases to be there to spur it on. We mistakenly project or extrapolate that other people are like us because most of us don’t have direct personal experience that contradicts.It’s not so for the rest of humanity. The level of ethnic hatred amongst and within East Asian ethnicities and amongst and within African ethnicities is inconceivable to most European people. Just because they aren’t slaughtering each other right this second doesn’t mean they have not with tedious regularity in the past or won’t do so in the future at the first opportunity, with the slightest of pretexts.A reader may be thinking “but what about Jews?” Antisemitism has been persistent throughout European history because Jews kept behaving badly and reminding European people why it was necessary. America-that-was was the one European country (yes, we were a self-consciously EUROPEAN people and country once) that didn’t have endemic antisemitism. How did that work out for us? Ashkenazi Jews (not blaming the Mizrahi or Sephardi) played an essential and catalytic role in our destruction.If we end up sliding into fully kinetic World War 3, the pent-up desire for tribal, ethnic, and racial score-settling is going to thoroughly end retarded notions that ‘diversity is a strength.’ I’m sure sample bias is an issue, but it seems to me that counties all over the world are moving to minimize their diversity vulnerabilities in what ways they can. Good for them. I wish my country were as well, but alas we are the one people on Earth that may be dumber than Ukies.

There is no cap on the different number of reasons supporters of mass immigrant tractor-beam can have. The fact they don’t see the boomerang or iceberg or whichever metaphor is preferred, is a collective-action dilemma and a fatal flaw in small-D democratic reasoning.

            Filthie:  There are plenty of turf wars – over committee assignments, over prime office space, over aides.  But it’s all in house.  They all know who’s bankrolling whom, who has dirt on whom, who speaks to which journolist (deliberate spelling).The oil that smooths the surface is money.  Lots and lots.  Political junkets.  Luxury gifts.  Gratis hotels and fine dining.  The possibility of moving up in the ranks and the grift.  They all enjoy being politicians – i.e. not the bullshitting of stupid voters, nor researching issues and writing bills (that’s what aides are for).  They love speaking with ‘authority.’  They love getting their picture taken.  They love being ‘in the club.’  And if they genuinely break ranks . . . it all goes away.That is what muh democracy selects for.  It’s student council and homecoming voting writ large.  Most people are irredeemably stupid.  Lots of stupid people equals democracy.

                That would explain a LOT of how they can march in unison, 3G.But …. Hell’s bells… I’m still baffled. That kind of unison and team work demands smarts, discipline and idedication, as you note. But Look at Bill Clinton: he risked his marriage, job and reputation… for a gummer under the desk from an intern. Consider the legions of cretins that went to Epstein’s Pervert Island… or Pelosi’s husband getting hammered by a gay prostitute. These guys do not make good decisions or have any risk assessment skills. We are probably only seeing the tip of the iceberg on this stuff too. I suspect (and hope I’m wrong)…that all this country’s problems are 100 times worse than we are lead to believe.For the kind of money these guys are throwing around, they “should” be able to procure reasonable people that will follow orders, play their roles and NOT embarrass The Establishment… shouldn’t they?Look – I know you guys have most of the big picture correct. But these little details just don’t fit into the pattern. I don’t know what to make of it because the system, any system – HAS to filter trash like this out to survive. Or, at least enough of it to function…?A thought occurs… I wonder if the system and the establishment has already crashed? Perhaps we are in the same phase the old Soviet Union was before it finally died? Where the country staggers along on momentum before it does that last, final swan dive into oblivion? Not trying to be a dink…my mind wanders more than it should, sometimes.

                    Filthie: You are making logical but incorrect assumptions.  No, they don’t have to be disciplined or smart.  They have tons of aides and handlers.  I had the misfortune of dealing with a couple of CODELs (Congressional Delegations).  This people are entitled, arrogant, condescending fools.  They get talking points from their aides, who come to the FSNs to find out what is genuinely happening.  They then massage the message to suit the circumstances.  Congressman/Senator “X” makes some serious pronouncement.  Meanwhile, he brings his wife and a kid and/or grandkid or two along so they can see some of the world, at taxpayer expense, of course. Then he adds on a visit to a resort town while in country.    The entire embassy staff – every last Marine Security Guard and political officer and even local secretarial staff – spends every working hour for weeks preparing for a CODEL and then weeks afterwards writing ‘reports’ about the visit, which the congressional aides will use to help write Senator “X’s” pronouncements about his “fact-finding trip.”It is ALL scripted.  It is all fake.  Yes, they all can be and are both stupid and evil.  And they get a lot of help from every other employee of the FedGov.

        Just two things…-I have an acquittance whose kid is doing the Mike Johnson “Political Science-&gt;Law School-&gt;Not-For-Profit” career path so I’m guessing it’s pretty well known at this point (and probably at ‘that’ point too).  Right away it says two things about the person.  First, they’re very risk adverse since “political science” is a very bullsh!t degree that the aspiring cloud candidate knows that they can ace for their law school application.  Secondly that their family has at least some sort of establishment and money since no one else is going to waste that vast sum of money on what are, on the surface, very crappy job prospects.-Even at my (really) low level in electoral politics the general rule is “don’t piss off the oligarchs” and then how quickly the oligarchs at any level “lock in” on their preferred candidate.  Locally they’ve “locked in” on a guy with, admittedly, great political skills and it’s clear they are fast-tracking him, Mike Johnson style, to some higher office.Just to further affirm your observation that there is nothing “accidental” about that Mike Johnson guy.

            A million years ago when I was a teenager, I would volunteer for political candidates. I had a part-time job with a congressman, so I would often be asked to volunteer for certain things. I was paid, of course. Even at that young age I could see the immense pressure to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy on all issues. This was the 1980’s, so if you were a Democrat, it meant chanting the lines about tax cuts for the wealthy. If you deviated from orthodoxy, you would quickly get a stink on you.it is not so much about politics as about managerialism. Think about what happens in a corporation. Young people enter the system and those who get the attention of the big boss, will then get the support of middle management. A good way for the thirty-something middle manager to win favor with his boss is to cultivate the twenty-something underlings. The young people who present risk are weeded out as those middle managers have zero tolerance for risk. Managerialism demands conformity, which means it selects for conformists.

        While I agree with the selection process, the x-factor with Johnson is how this all came about.  Throwing that lying toad McCarthy out was a disruptive event.  Akin to Trump’s election, but on a smaller scale given the office.  Throwing out a Speaker has never happened before.  The Democrats – every bit as fractured as the GOP – we’re taking notes.  Especially the ones in the Coalition of the Vibrant.The thing about disruptive events is they break the status quo.  Most times, like with Trump or the 2011 sequestration/debt ceiling/shutdown, the Government Party puts in place new rules to prevent it from being used again.  But with the Speaker “motion to vacate”, there will be a lot of parties who will want to keep that power.The status quo is the post Civil War 2 party system.  This most recent event blows that up in favor of a parliamentary system and, effectively, a “vote of no confidence”.  Kind of “Parliament, American-style”.  The only thing it really lacked was MAGA-sympathetic Democrats (and they do exist) joining up with the House Freedom Caucus to elect a Speaker.The Official Government Party wouldn’t allow that, and could not decloak to have Official Government Party Republicans to vote with OGP Democrats to elect somebody even worse than McCarthy.  They’re just not ready to abandon the illusion of choice business model and go full Hunger Games with a Capitol and brutalized districts that pay them tribute.The status quo continues to crumble.  Removing McCarthy revealed/outed about 2-dozen Democrats openly pretending to be Republicans.  There are more than that, and really only about 80-100 Repubs who I would say at least managed to slip through the cracks and are MAGA-sympathetic.For Johnson, he may be what you say, but if he was openly contemptuous of us, he’d have brought a combined Israel/Ukraine/Hamas funding bill to the floor.  Instead, he did Israel only.  This is good because it probably can’t pass the Senate.  Or, at the very least, forces the Tribe’s hostages to refuse money for Israel.  I don’t think we should send a penny, but it’ll be fun watching Schumer and McConnell twist.If the end result is no money for the Permanent War Party, we all win.Lastly, another broken McCarthy promise was to bring 12 separate funding bills for 12 separate votes.  We’ve been living under omnibus and CR funding schemes for years, masking a lot of corruption and forcing people to vote for all or nothing.  12 votes on 12 bills allows Johnson to extract concessions from the bureaucrats in exchange for money/authorization.If he saves DOJ and DHS for last, and refuses funding until they stop their illegal activities, it’ll be a good start.So, let’s see what he does.

Instead, he did Israel only.I think his meteoric rise is due to him still putting on a good show for the rubes back home. He is also good at smoothing the feathers of the twenty or so people who want to serve their voters. Note that the so-called freedom caucus guys fell in line with Johnson. Christian Inc. has a lot of clout in their districts. That means guys like Gaetz cannot get too sassy with the new Speaker.In the end, the regime gets all of their money for Israel, most of their money for Ukraine and no money goes to the border. That is always the compromise Republicans get from the Democrats. You get nothing and they get invited to the Democrats celebration party.

                You’re probably right.  Like you, I always assume the most cynical possible outcome.  I’ve rarely been disappointed by doing so.  If I give him the benefit of the doubt and nothing comes of it, I’m no worse off.  If he believes what he says and acts on it, he’ll have a small window before the 2024 election fraud to engage in some guerilla warfare tactics against the Government Party before they change all the votes to Democrats to hand the House back to them.The disruptive nature of this is where we disagree.  I think it may have a longer-lasting effect.  Ukraine enjoys almost no public support.  Nobody is calling Congress demanding another $80B for Ukraine.  None of the Speaker candidates openly in favor of Ukraine funding got more than 20-30 votes.  Johnson will not have the votes needed from the GOP to pass Ukraine funding which means doing it with Democrat help.  There is no appetite after this Speaker circus for joining up with Democrats to do anything.  They floated that balloon before collapsing behind Johnson.As you wrote a week or two ago, the regime is looking for a way out of Ukraine.  If they can blame Republicans for the collapse that is coming, all the better.  Money for Hamas is just not going to happen.  Even if only half the stories are true, the level of barbarism Hamas employees engaged in was so over the top that I don’t see them getting any money directly.  It’ll be laundered through NGOs in some way.The marker I think matters is these budget bills.  Johnson has been vocally pretty hostile to the DOJ for what it is doing, and he defended Trump during the Ukraine hoax/trial, so there are some scores to settle.

                “they get invited to the Democrats celebration party.”This is much more important than people think. Washington is a small town, and the social scene is completely dominated by liberals. Every party, function, aware ceremony, the media, it’s all organized by liberals.People are social animals. A conservative first arriving in DC might resist the social pressure for a few years, but, over time, they acclimate to their environment. And the DC scene is a lot more fun for 90%+ of these guys than the local scene.I think one of the big things with Tucker Carlson is that he discovered a different social scene over time. Having grown up with the liberal social scene, I’d suspect that he wasn’t as impressed by it as the rubes and was happy to do some new stuff. I still think he considers himself part of that class, but he’s not terrified of being excluded from some of their parties. He was born into that class, so he can take shots at it because he’ll always be a member.

            “For Johnson, he may be what you say, but if he was openly contemptuous of us, he’d have brought a combined Israel/Ukraine/Hamas funding bill to the floor. Instead, he did Israel only.”Although I upvoted you for the good insight and analysis, I can’t say I fully agree. IMO, the fact that he brought only Israel funding to the floor just goes to show where his real priorities are. If the tribe wants it, the tribe gets it. Or else.If voting to send money to a foreign country — any foreign country — while our own border is wide open doesn’t show open contempt, I don’t know what does.BTW, Israel has universal health care. Americans don’t. It’s pretty rich to be sending our money over there when our own people are drowning in drugs, inflation, and medical debt. I’m friends with a small business owner who has to buy insurance on the open market. Their premiums for next year just went up nearly 20% to 30K a year. Who can afford this? But hey, let’s send money to the group that really matters. (Hint, it ain’t us.)

                I agree with you, and I don’t think we should be sending money to any of them.  For the Trump base of the MAGA coalition, Israel could be the thing that finally fractures Trump’s support.  There are a lot of Evangelicals who not only want to send money to Israel, but also want to have this FINALLY be the “final war” that brings about the rapture.  They’re all in on exterminating Hamas, triggering a regional war with the Muslims, and bringing about Armageddon.They’ve been so patient, but are tired of waiting for God.Across the table from them are MAGA voters who see this mess for what it is – another misadventure for the Permanent War Party.  These are the folks who know that there is no strategic objective other than giving money to people who want money and that chaos is good for business.  They also understand that depleting the US military is a key objective of the regime.That split is problematic for us.I see hopeful signs though…more of the evangelicals I know are realizing this is not the rapture and maybe armageddon isn’t all it is cracked up to be.  They’re remembering the Iraq/Afghanistan debacles and looking at Gaza and realizing there’s no solution there that doesn’t involve killing everyone in Gaza.

            While I suspect the differences between McCarthy and Johson are very marginal, I tend to agree with you about the disruption aspect. Even when they are substantively meaningless, disruptions within a corrupt system cause extreme distress. Fractures tend to increase once the initial cracks emerge. I had forgotten the extortion attempt on Gaetz’s father, which of course has been memoryholed, and that gave him a lot of leeway to throw a bomb, even if it proves largely a dud. Along with the accidental election of Trump and the subsequent Russia collusion hoax’s exposure, serious reputational damage was inflicted. I don’t know what to make of Epstein, to be honest, but that seems to have been a major body blow.I think the Regime is ready to move away from Ukraine, though, so there is little problem with cutting off or decreasing funds for it and bribe money for them.
