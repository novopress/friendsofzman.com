        About a million years ago, I had to take the Strong Interest Inventory to get into the same institution as young Chris here.  The requirement was dropped at some point.
I was required to take the Meyers Briggs thingamajig in an official setting at least once after graduating.  I’ve also had to take it (purely voluntary!) in the corporate world and in grad school.

Don’t know. Maybe you just did not realize it. “Self-inventory tests” were developed by the US Military over a century ago. They have been administering IQ tests since WW1.

        When I was young, a company I was with hired an industrial psychologist. He interviewed everyone in a casual setting and then invited people in for more intense discussions about how they viewed themselves in the organization. It was obvious the guy was a fraud. This was before the diversity rackets caught on in corporate America. I suspect he moved into that racket soon after I met him.I had no interest in the job and decided to have some fun with the good doctor. I made up a pretty good violent fantasy that I let him slowly discover. Frankly, I was bit surprised he was that dumb, but I was young and unaware of the PhD rackets. He dutifully reported it to my superiors, who were smart enough to know I was gaming the good doctor.They got rid of him soon after.

        I have found, in a couple of different jobs, that the results of these personality tests can be manipulated, according to what personality type you want it to provide.
The problem I have with it is that I find it hard to decide what personality the big dogs would want me to have so that I get more raises and promotions. So I usually end up by making it so that I come across as the biggest asshole possible.

        I have a ‘shovel-ready’ horoscope for all people, which I can issue to all at no great cost (or effort) to myself. It goes something like this:“You are frustrated and are being held back by people with less to offer than yourself. You are talented and sensitive, clever and deep. Of all the signs of the zodiac, yours is the most complete. You are always searching for even greater meaning in life and though it can be a difficult road as so many seek to obstruct you along the way. But take heart for just around the corner lies a bright future and you will soon reach your true destiny.”This, of course, would appeal to leaders and politicians because it contains the word “lies.”
