        “. . . provides a clue for how American progressivism could survive as well.”I disagree. White progressives must be “in front” of the plebs morally, i.e. they must disagree with them, to maintain their feeling of moral superiority. As soon as the majority of people move to agree with the progressives, the progressive moves farther out.You saw that with gays. First, the progressives tolerated gays, but as the majority accepted that position, progressives moved to embracing gay to celebrating gays and then did the same with transgenderism. Progressives have to hold a morality different from the majority to maintain the self-anointed status, so there can be no settled morality.

            Yeah, it’s the nearest thing to “permanent revolution” that we can see. It also trips up ostensibly reasonable people (like me maybe when I was a young Normie). I supported drug legalization and gay marriage because I don’t like telling other people what to do. What a fooking idiot I was….

                    I voted for Mondale AND for Dukakis (18 and 22 yrs. old). But something(s) triggered a change (maturity?) and I got a whiff of the d-baggery of “both sides of the aisle” (sigh…) and set me on a course down this-here yellow brick road.I don’t think that those “triggers” happen much anymore.

                        Never was a political person myself.  But in youth, my sympathies generally were leftist.  Of course, the Democratic Party was (ostensibly) the party of the workingman and of labor when I was young, in the Fifties and Sixties. Now, they’re the party of the damned.
Modernly, no party even vaguely represents my interests, and I consider them all the enemy.  With good reason.

            Exactly. Progressivism’s evolving morality is in fact a form of permanent revolution. It is in fact moving toward an American-style of totalitarianism although it alternatively could veer toward water buffalo worship or something else. The “who says?” question and the definition of morality never can be settled or progressivism ceases to be a thing. This is both the Achilles Heel and raison d’etre of the Global American Empire and thus the reason it is falling apart. Frankly, it is a bloody miracle it has lasted this long.

                I think that the RoW has realized that GAE can never quit, can never live at peace with other countries. GAE is terrifying (and annoying) combination of WASP moral progressives and Jewish supremacists. The WASPs are incapable of accepting that other groups might have a different morality while Jews are incapable of accepting that other groups might not want to have Jews running amok in their society.
GAE is the terminator. It doesn’t know how to quit. Other countries understand this now and are working to build walls to keep us out.

                    The Pride flags flying at embassies encapsulate this phenomenon perfectly. I float the idea from time to time that the WASP’s continue to have the upper hand and most disagree. Given that discretion to fly Pride flags is given to ambassadors only in Muslim countries, they may be right.
The GAE indeed is terrifying. It has deeply religious convictions that change almost daily and the penalty for apostasy often is death.

                        That WASP influence would be analogous to the Old Money families in Europe, such as the Black Nobility with ties back to Venice, William the Conqueror, or even Rome.

                    GAE as the Terminator the rest of the world is trying to manage is an important point.
One recent action that supports this idea are Iran’s recent comments they are finished responding to Our Greatest Ally in a restrained fashion.

                Yes. GAE/ZOG has replaced the Soviet Union as a militaristic, expansionist, totalitarian empire. Democratic “equity” for obese trannies and negroes and women is simply a form of communism.
Unlike the boot-on-your-throat, industrial Soviet communism, though, it’s basically a Huxleyan/sexual/consumerist communism. Anal sex, abortion and weed seem to be its core principles. The will put a boot on your throat if they have to, but they’d rather keep you quiescent by happily cruising gay bars in Greenwich Village and taking soma (weed).

            It’s like African-American style. Once the whites embrace it, AA’s start wearing other ridiculous crap.

                Except you quickly reach a dead end.  I saw snippets of the latest video by some African rapper yesterday and it was indistinguishable from a 90’s “gangsta” rap video.  The same clothes, the same misogyny, the same hand gestures, the same glorification of cheaply acquired wealth.  Black popular culture has hardly budged since hip-hop and basketball Americans assumed god-like status during the Clinton years.

                    That’s probably the point of establishing a morality. Except for a few wiggers and hispanegroes, American blacks have found a “look” and it’s nearly impossible for outsiders to adopt it without looking ridiculous.European Christianity established a morality that very few elsewhere in the world could adopt, and it served as a barrier for entry. Now Europeans (driven by Jews and Anglos) are seeing how far they can push “alternate lifestyles” and replaceable-part consumerism before non-Anglos give up trying to assimilate. Once we reach that stage – probably polyamorous pedophilia or something – then “white people” have found a “look” that few can, or would, emulate.

                            France doesn’t have an age of consent. Major French politicians in the 90s talked about doing it with kids. France legalized homosexuality in the revolution.
And it’s not just the French:the Dutch age of consent is 13!In Italy trans “models” were a big thing in the 80s and 90s.
I don’t think you know much about European culture.
The Wasps are much less degenerate than the average continental.

                    This occurred to me as I have been recently rewatching “The Wire”. Except for the tech, nothing has changed. Baltimore is still Baltimore, arguably worse. One of the gateways to this side of the great divide is the realization that it can’t be fixed.
The implications of that are not for the faint of heart.

                    Blacks—everyone but East Asians, really—have been trained to hate old music. Dumb ones simply obey their screens, the algorithmic BUY NOW that says if you’re not shopping you’re lame (white), while smart ones chant “canonicity is whiteness.”It’s recent. Just a generation ago,old record black guywho showed the kids Bobby Womack was a stock character—in media and in life. He’s extinct. Theydon’t learn anymore. Hiphop made by hiphop fans is stereotypically inbred/regressed, ugly and retarded. The inventors of it were interested in other things. The genre-defining rap beat was jacked from Kraftwerk.

                        I remember growing up (Catholic elem. &amp; h.s.) and having a few black friends in grade school (mostly 4th – 8th gr.). Because of where I grew up, they were the children of military families (enlisted), and thus had at leastsomelevel of discipline at home.But what I also remember is, during that era (ca. 1986 – 1990), learning about / hearing “go-go” black music. I liked the rhythm, but it never really “gelled” for me. I had a musical-enough brain (thank you piano lessons &amp; clarinet lessons) to know that it all sounded the same, even though I could detect differences in the various songs.What’s interesting to me is that now, very occasionally, if I’m driving somewhere, I hear a knee-grow’s car music (windows down, added bass speakers in back seat, of course) that is go-go music, I smile and shake my head.Because it isexactly the sameas it was back in the mid-80s. Exactly. No evolution. Probably just new bands that learned it from listening to the old bands.Anyway, that’s my little snippet of insight into black KULL-cha.It is strongly correlated with Africa: just keeps on staying the same, generation after generation. Imagine that.

                        East Asia is not immune.  If you listen to popular music from any of the three major languages, the songs are quite often filled with pounding beats and with rap breaks that would have been cringy in a late 80’s after school special.

                Not so sure about that. The progressives would happily adopt a model that lets them be the first and final arbiter of what is moral. You see it now in the way their media arm tries so hard to select who can and cannot run for political office. I’m also very, very sure that they’d be quite happy to throw apostates off of tall buildings.

            I think that you’re right.  I also think that with fallen human nature, there will always be some supposed “victim” for progressives to champion.  So there seem to be multiple driving forces for those “self-anointed” ones.In addition to their disdain for us, they believe themselves as being on the side of the oppressed, while, in many cases, they are actually advocating for the evil, the immoral, the flawed, the degenerate, the evolutionary mutant, etc.If one doesn’t accept the Christian idea of fallen humanity, one can still accept, by looking at history, that humans have certain biological tendencies that will always result in conflict and/or moral shortcomings, which we here would believe must be discouraged or limited or punished.  So there will always be grist for the progressives’ mill.  And they will always be around as a danger for the rest of us.I’m sure we can all agree with C. S. Lewis:“She’s the sort of woman who lives for others.  You can tell the others by their hunted expression.”

                Anyone else notice the constant use of “forward”? “Moving forward,” “going forward”…it’s as prevalent as the gratuitous (and incorrect) constant use of “literally.”
But in the case of “forward,” it’s to subliminally suggest that trad is bad…and that we must always be pushing “forward” (which means “change” is the foremost quality and everything not changing is “backward.”)

            That’s been our faith for 30 years, but even American whites are starting to notice that something isn’t right. What’s more, blacks never accepted it. Hispanics never even noticed it. Finally, Indians see the game being played by Jews and want to play it themselves, which causes a serious problem for Jews.

                It causes a serious problem for the rest of the US too.  See Z’s post on Hindu Lebensraum.  India has a huge, young, and growing population that is looking to move.  Canada and the US are desired destinations.  Indians are nice and polite people right now, but they are as tribal as anyone in the world and will play that game hard when their numbers are sufficient.  You can already see it in the IT sector.  Whites and East Asians get excluded.  Look at all the AA benefits Indians get from the SBA that are not available to citizens.  That will keep the pressure on to maintain and increase them.Given how much the Hindus and the Jews dislike the Muslims, an alliance of convenience is not out of the question.  With the US doing or at least paying for the fighting.

                    Agree. But if whites are going to act like slaves, they’re going to have a master of some type or another. Whites could easily throw off their Jewish masters or any other group if we simply started to view ourselves as a people, but we don’t.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me a thousand times, shame on me. Whites should be ashamed.

                        White is more diverse than Jewish, or even Indian. Iirc, Z has mentioned Aleksandr Dugin talking about a civilizational perspective. That’s probably more workable than a racial one, but even then, you have to deal with the Athens and Jerusalem bit. You almost have to start from the beginning to get a sense of who you are.

                        That slave training is exactly why I’m becoming allergic to the whole “we are fallen sinners” crap, because that line originated as slave training for a “conquered” people.  The Original Sin was to be Aryan white, it’s early Bronze Age propaganda.I say “conquered” because we, in large part, weren’t.That supremacist tripe is just what they told themselves when making their stories.“Oh, but the sin of pride” and all that claptrap.  I get it, bow your head in gratitude and loyalty, but if we were as stiff-necked with racial certainty as any Indian, or Negro, or Jew, we would not have given away all we created for free so it can be turned against us.At ruinous cost. At ruinous cost, and only to those who show gratitude. Those who do not have gratitude in them will only kiss the hand that holds the whip, they will respect nothing less.

                    Indians are nice and polite until they fire you from your job to replace you with co-ethnics.  They are a menace, just of a different type from the other more violent ones.  None should ever have been allowed to come here.  They need to go back.

                        Living in a rural area, we’ve noticed that Indian doctors have that supremacist attitude, at least toward rural dwellers. The way they condescend is shocking. Actually had one say to me “Let’s get this straight. I will tell you what to do, and you will DO it.”Seriously. After 3 such exchanges in a row w/3 different doctors from India, we try to pick heritage-Americans (if we HAVE to go, anyway–since covid lies, we don’t have trust left for the “medical community.”)Never had a problem w/Jewish doctors. Sad to see how “normalized” anti-semitism is now….esp since what most people mean is “globalist,” and that includes those w/non-Jewish names like bush, obama, romney, mcconnell, johnson, newsome, etc.

            The raison d’etre of America is the permanent revolution, hence the Jewish comedians are yielding to Progressive scolds who in turn are falling apart (disagree with Z on the permanence) and likely to be replaced by other religious fundamentalists. I do appreciate the wisdom of the analogy, though.

            I think this was the case until 7 years ago or so. Before Trump won, TV shows and movies were still “good” and stand-up was more popular than ever. Jews were driving most of the popular podcasts, even the “right-wing” ones.Now there is an ever-larger segment that is decoupling from mainstream entertainment. People who watch mainstream entertainment either have kids and can’t escape them, or are terminally normie and the proverbial sack of potatoes.I think for the Progressive and the Regime-minded, what’s on TV and on mainstream news is scripture, or at least is something to critique, as if it were handed down from above and they were Rabbis arguing over what the message means.For the rest of us, we have a jumble of old religions and new modes of thought made possible by the internet.

            They might actually be the oldest continuously existing state in the world. It comes down to definitions of a state and whether a state can continue existing when it is occupied.

            If you lump Iran in with Arabs, you are dumber than a box of rocks.  I’ve mentioned this before, but all one needs to do is look at current Russia-Iran exchange due to Ukrainian war.  Iran has built a forward thinking response to US technology edge via the revolutionary use of inexpensive drones.  They also have the “bomb”.  They’ve refined uranium to just under fissionable material percent, but have huge amounts.  Processes to take it to useful percentage is now of short duration in the centrifuges.  I suspect all other aspects of ignition are already constructed.  Not sure why they have not simply built and tested as North Koreans did.

            There’s a popular (2.4 million subscribers) youtube channel called Itchy Boots, where a woman named Noraly travels the world on a motorcycle.  A few years ago she travelled across Iran.  You get a sense of what Iran is like, and it’s much different than what we’re led to believe.  Of course she has to cover her head, but the Iranians treat her very well and the country is scenic.

                I’d like to know, do they allow genital mutilation on their women or boys? I don’t think so, and it would make a huge difference.Ugly, I know, but today’s is about Iranian morality.You see, if you want to cure most of Semitic pathology, you start at the root.If the Semitic practice is not conducted in Iran, I’ll bet that’s why they can function as a democracy, rather than a tyranny or a hapless mess.Khomeini was British-Indian, but your typical baby-buggering pervert, as he said in his Green Book. Khamanei, the religious authority, is fairly hands off as long as he gets his busloads of little boys.(Khomeini did seal his conquest with strangling 100,000 girls in warehouses 1979-81, the Rape of Iran, and they hanged homosexuals with cranes. Nonetheless, AIDS and heroin are or were rampant, at least during the Bush years.)Banning GM would not only eliminate the brain damage that perpetuates phantasmic hysteria, it would change the breeding pattern that inculcates Dark Triad traits. These both express, reflect, and reinforce the MA0A genetics as a culture prone to trauma conditioning; the breeding pattern results in a focused seed core of traits with its unfortunate fat tail, whereas more assimilable outliers (like myself) are boiled off into the larger surrounding populations.Of course, consanguinity (close kin marriage) also reinforces, that’s why both Semitic and Indian populations remain static. Gone, however, would be the tendency towards perversity and pathological violence.

        “the Iranians have recreated a throne and altar society, something the West abandoned in favor of reason and democracy.”
Abandoned for Jewish finance capitalism with a threadbare democratic facade that doesn’t fool any astute observer.
“Otherwise, it shakes itself to pieces searching for something to fill the void that lies at the center of it.”
That’s the thing, isn’t it? That void and the nihilism and despair it engenders.

            Most of what we’re witnessing now is the larger countries of the world attempting to move away from Jewish financial control (enforced by white guys in the military). The Global American Empire is a financial/trade empire, which suits Jews perfectly, though it originated with the British, then the WASPs took it over and now the Jews have it.The heavy use of trade and financial sanctions against Russia is no accident. But it failed, which is more important than the military defeat in Ukraine. It will take a long time, but the BRICs are slowing – so slowly – working on creating alternative payment mechanisms and other financial channels to circumvent the current global financial system.The BRICs don’t need to – nor do they want to – replace the dollar. They just need enough alternative mechanisms to get trade done in a pinch. GAE will recede to a regional power over the coming decades – and then will need to look inward, where it won’t like what it sees.

                Small quibble-not-quibble, “…though it originated with the British,…”
I wanted to disagree, being shamelessly biased, but cannot.Of course, I wanted to blame Judeo-Christianity, because Jewish values.But honestly, that’s just a bit much of a stretch all the time, really.
Then I realized the foundation for Jack Dobson’s “Puritan” ethos, which is still a bit fuzzy: Anglo-Saxons and Normans.
Like the Bronze Age Semitic supremacists, the Angles and Danes are a conquering people, much closer to our hearts. Britain probably gets much of its difficult history from this aspect.

            Much of the wall was constructed in the post war (ww2) period. Not all of it, but at least some of it.  Plus, even when it was written, it applied to the federal government, not the states. Massachusetts, for example, had a state church with taxing authority of the residents of the state.

                Iran’s people know where they are going because they know where they have been. That is to say, they understand and value their history.
Thus, they are able to use it as a guide for acting in the present and to plan for the future.
In comparison, look at how the GAE treats the historical legacy that enabled it to ascend to the height of global power.

            Everyone has collapsing birth rates embedded into the fabric of their civilization. Some have manifest. Some have not. yet.All women want sex. Not all women want babies. The dominant pattern in human history up to about 50 years ago was that women had no choice in the matter: sex -&gt; babies. This is the pattern that EVOLVED. No other selection pressure was necessary for perpetuation.The advent of inexpensive and effective birth control has decoupled sexual gratification and babies. This broke the dynamic equilibrium. The only societies that are reproducing are those that control their women both with intense cultural programming and limited access to birth control.This is a self-correcting process. Only the natal are reproducing. Over several generations (I think this is a strong selection pressure) the anti-natal will be removed from the gene pool as long as several conditions are met. One, organized anti-natal cultural programming needs to be destroyed. I know people get tired of it, but reality is what it is: this means everyone’s favorite transnational tribe need to be sent back to their own country. Second, as Moran ya Simba points out, one has to stop the replacement.So, retain female autonomy but remove the existential threats of anti-white culture and population replacement, and populations will continue to drop. But they will eventually stabilize at a lower level. This is basically what the Japanese are doing. Theypermitneither genocidal anti-Japanese culture nor open immigration of enemy aliens.

                That last bit is no longer true.There’s a famous photo from Japan of an isolated countryside vending machine under a dedicated street light, its uninterrupted peaceful vigil to dispense drinks to a people who don’t steal (except umbrellas). It looks like the past we just barely remember, California from old movies. It’s often paired with the most American picture, a school Pepsi machine so tightly and complexly welded into its custom security cage that you can’t even put money in it.The Eye Of Globohomo saw that picture of Japan, and saw America’s longing for it, and sent Rahm Emanuel et fils torepairit. Japan’s population “gap” is now flooded with Nigerians and Indians (high IQ!), and we have the photos of crowbar-mutilated vending machines to prove it.Civilization is not allowed—anywhere ever again.

Win, not “nation build”. Israel is the only country presently fighting for civilization against certain barbarity.I never heard anyone blaming the Allies for the multitudes of German children killed in 1944-45.

        Not exactly bloodless, the Iranian revolution was a weird mix of socialism and shia Islam. That’s actually the debate at the imam council level. The original Ayatollah actually leaned more socialist than shiite, but still killed a lot of mainline communists in camps. It’s why Reagan tried to smuggle them guns.
Shia Islam is also the more reason driven branch of Islam. Famously, the Ayatollah’s favorite book was The Republic. It’s as if The Guardians let the people have a little democracy.
Fascinating place. Well worth picking up some books about it.

                It really depended on the religious minority. Like all revolutions, murder and expulsion of regime opponents real or perceived was the first order of business. All Bahai and Zoroastrians either fled, were murdered, or expelled immediately. They were not perceived as People of the Book. Jews and Armenian Christians not perceived as enemies of the state were allowed to stay in some cases under tightly controlled conditions. Sunnis were in some cases allowed to remain under limited rights. It is somewhat analogous to how Israel treats Gentiles.One report that stuck with me after the revolution was that before they were executed, religious minorities who were considered apostates and were female virgins above the age of eight were raped before they were killed. The idea was that rape would prevent them from going to heaven. That story I now realize was likely Jewish propaganda, but, wow, if true.

        Both Iran and Russia are succeeding as nations and not succumbing to subjugation by the West. That is why they are hated by the Globalists and must be destroyed. And the Globalists are pleased to sacrifice their peons in service to this goal. This dynamic will persist and escalate until this small cadre of parasites feels the heat of their debauchery. That is the solution to the problem. We don’t need to keep refining the diagnosis. We need to implement the cure.

And now they want US military grunts to die in Gaza, Lebanon, and Iran on their behalf. At some point, the cannon fodder must turn around and point their guns at the real enemy.

        Iran is not immune to moral problems. There are periodic protests, often mass protests. Mostly by young people desiring more sexual freedom and the end of restrictions on women’s dress, sexuality, and so on. In one infamous incident, a young woman protester was shot in the head and killed by the religious police.The religious police are mostly despised in urban areas, no surprise they are also corrupt and they are hated in Iran as they are in Saudi Arabia by the younger people.Technology, particularly mass media, consumerism, and professional urbanization seem even in Islamic nations to erode the social consensus on morality. This process of techno-urbanization tends to atomize even Muslims, to the point of individuality becoming the moral baseline (its good because I WANT IT) rather than the social norms enforced by villages where everyone knows everyone else. In the big city, like “Taxi Driver” anonymity leads to social isolation and a race to the gutter. [Paul Schrader’s point in the script.]And there are problems in Iran that cannot be solved by Islam: racial/ethnic separatism. Persians are maybe 62% of the population — there are Balochi, Kurdish, Khuzestan (Arabs), and Azeri separatists. The CIA will often stir them up, as will Pakistan, and the issues of nationalism (the Balochis are Shia) along with Sunni-ism (the others are not Shia) cannot be reconciled by Shia Islam. Allah is silent on the issues of nations.I also agree the Progressivism can only go to new moral extremes, in order to confer status and power and positions to the Progressive. If everyone agrees, their power/authority and specialness goes away. Its why you have the Oregon Forestry Dept suspending the #2 guy because some purple haired land whale Diversity Officer snitched him out for hiring on merit not gayness.In order to succeed in the West, we need a new moral order based on both “because we live here” morality of past sacrifice, and the “mandate of heaven” of actually delivering the goods. Musk is looking at this as a way to produce both a stable elite and one that is effective. It is not lost on many that he can capture rockets and re-use them. Blue haired landwhales can only be triggered.

        Well, Iran also shows us that what comes next might very well be what came before. Americans and atheists, but I repeat myself, simply cannot conceive of a system where the legitimacy of the regime is determined by how it attends to the business of the peace and the faith – which was the old term for what the authorities were doing as they looked out for the health of the Body of Christ.We can’t have that, you know, because we discovered the steam engine or because we didn’t encounter God when our guys went to space or whatever. Never mind that Iran seems to have a functioning, modern society with cars and internet and everything, and accomplishes this with a religious system that is much less bound by ideas like rationality that Christendom ever was.

There is a parody government in the game Hellraisers 2 called “Managed Democracy” which is clearly a hard-line dictatorship in a democratic veneer. The Starship Troopers like soldiers are talking about defending this government from the aliens who are invading.

        Iran is always going to be a regional hegemon. It’s economy alone dictates that. It is a crime against logic that we don’t ditch the “mad mullah” BS talk and engage the Iranians. We let bygones be bygones with Vietnam.Why not make peace with Iran unless we are directly controlled by our overlords in Tel Aviv? That proves who really runs our government thanks to AIPAC dollars.We’ve never fought a war against the Persians, unless you count Operation Nimble Archer and the tanker wars in the late 1980s. I know the Obama administration tried, but the predictable neocons went bananas and the deal, likely a bad one for our country, was put aside.Their Air Force still has three relics from the Shah’s time still flying: F-4 Phantoms, F-14 Tomcats and F-5 Tigers. Fascinating how their aeronautical industry has grown simply building parts for these museum pieces.

        Modern America has nothing to do with Scriptural Christianity.  It is its antithesis.  The U.S. idols are (disastrous and hypocritical) egalitarianism, drawn directly from Jacobin France via egalite.  Not exactly a traditional sire, eh?  The other idols are reason and ‘democracy’, which are inherited from the Enlightenment, not from Christianity.In cultural practice, America is a feminist society . . . all institutions are controlled by collective female power.  Its men are spiritual and ethical weaklings, ruled over by their wives and daughters.  Again — the antithesis of Scriptural Christianity, which via Pauline refinement is expressly patriarchal and hierarchical, not matrifocal and egalitarian.  The Biblical model is Christ obeys Father (God), men obey Christ, and women obey men.This obtains exactly nowhere in modern America… including the churches, which are as feminized and modernized as the rest of the (degraded) culture.  What you need is throne and altar.  What you have is post-Enlightenment, feminist plutocracy, with globalist banksters (the get of the Templars) calling the governmental shots.

        Let’s say there exists an American nation; ie whites that have ties to pre ww2 America. I think you could rightly call them a nation. But that’s another topic. Let’s say that nation became self conscious and kicked everyone else out of North America.
would there be a throne and altar? You’re still stuck with a “mere Christianity” scenario at best and then its back to muh constitution and smarty pants like Thomas too cool for religion Jefferson.

            Most here will probably disagree (fine by me), but the “mere Christianity” needs to be changed to Catholicism. [cue moans and eye rolls]And I amnottalking about the f*ggotFwancisChurch of Novus Ordo. I’m talking about the Traditional Church where women wear modest clothes, men wear suits, etc. to Mass, and out of the house. And where the population is only White, Christian, and has European [prove-able?] blood roots.I’m also talking about the idea of an elected monarchy, wherein the local peoples (maybe we keep the king’s ruling area to, oh, let’s say the combined size of TX and OK) directly elect their monarch (to control for the variable of stupidity / or lack of leadership skill) for the rest of his natural life.And only men who owned land could vote. No women voting, at all. And no queens (of either type).That’s where I’d start.

        That’s an interesting elucidation of Iranian government. Sounds like they’ve got a pretty good system.As for government and politics in AINO, a couple of quibbles. First, I don’t consider defeating global communism to have been part of the progressive project. The Left in America prior to the rise of the New Left was ambivalent on this matter. They certainly were not, in the main, pinkos. However, there were plenty of fellow travelers and anti-anti commies. I guess one could say they were soft on communism. It was conservatives, generally a weak and feckless tribe, who did the heavy lifting to defeat global communism. And that’s about the only thing they get any credit for.And second, I don’t see AINO’s Power Structure as being particularly beholden to reason. Quite the opposite. Just look at the madness that undergirds the depravity, perversity and negrophilia of the age, and tell me how this measures up to the bar of reason. It does not. Reason is all on the side of normalcy, traditional morality and calling a spade a spade. But the New Left, whose intellectual wellspring is irrationalist poststructuralism, views reason as a white, racist narrative and therefore rejects it whenever it sees fit.

        Progressive thinkers who have abandoned Christianity are still wedded to secular humanism, a form of morality that puts human well-being at the forefront of the list of priorities. The support for trans people and extreme feminism is the icing on the cake as far as they’re concerned. The notions that animate progressivism are ever-expanding, a buffet table of wishful desserts. What is “in” one year is added on by two “in”s the next year.It’s impossible to fully satisfy the progressive heart. 💓 Left in limbo by society and driven to make changes, he gathers with like-minded rabble-rousers and takes to the airwaves to express his demands.The flaw with the intellectual conservative is believing the obsessive progressive can be reasoned with. You can’t reason with someone who is as emotional as a girl, you can only put your foot down and turn the heel.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

        The traditional Catholic understanding of the relationship of Church and State is the “two swords” philosophy, wherein the state has certain functions as does the Church. The state functions are always circumscribed by the Church’s moral teachings while the Church supports the State as long as the State operates within those boundaries. This relationship was always problematic, since rulers typically concern themselves with acquiring more wealth and power whereas the Church is intent on promoting virtue and holiness among its flock (including the rulers). The potential for clashes is obvious and they were frequent. The liberal ideology that replaced the old order was radically opposed to the Church’s sexual and economic morality and thus totally opposed to the two swords doctrine and has effectively abolished Church influence on public policy. Attempts by the Church to live within the new arrangement have been unsuccessful. Public policy has become radically anti-Christian and there has been a dramatic drop off in Christian faith, greatly encouraged by the public educational and propaganda apparatus. Actual physical violence against believers and churches is becoming more frequent and merely publicly praying at an abortion clinic can get you a prison sentence.

        For individuals, the basic moral question is “what kind of person do I choose to be?” For nations, the basic political question is “what kind of society do we choose to have?”“In the end, we face every day the question posed by American Founder Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper #1:‘whether societies of men are really capable of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.’The answer is equivocal. We can establish morality (and good government) by reflection and choice, but our choices are both shaped and limited by our history, culture, religion, and populations. If people in other countries can’t understand what we’re talking about or understand that it’s true, then we have no right to impose our beliefs on them. If we choose to do it anyway, the cost is often very high for everyone involved. The wisest course is to live as morally as we can according to our own judgment, and to allow people in other countries and groups the same privilege.”—Why Sane People Believe Crazy Things
