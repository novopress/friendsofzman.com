        My objection to the nomenclature of “Total State” “Deep State” “Leviathan” “Managerial State” etc is that it creates the impression that the problem is so large and intractable that it is unsolvable by any reasonable means. Every proposed solution devolves into an arcane or esoteric complexity of analysis and speculation. Ultimately you get a division of camps supporting the usual remedies; civic persuasion via magic words, voting harder, militias, secession, civil war, et.at. Why not just call a spade a spade? Our society is infected with a pathogenic virus in the form of human parasites. Although inordinately powerful, they are relatively few in number. And a billion years of life on Earth says the optimum solution is antibodies because the pathogens must go if we are to live. Keep it simple and call it like it is.

            This is an optimistic take and I hope correct, but it increasingly seems the problem is with the infected and not the virus.

                I kind of agree. I think a lot of people overestimate how many of der normie is actually on our side. I don’t necessarily know if that matters or not, but I do think the normalcattle isn’t nearly as angry by (most) of the state of affairs as we’d like to think they are.

                    The problem is “normalcattle” don’t matter.  The “normalcattle” is busy eating and producing milk, babies and beef.
What matters is the elite.  They are all on the same page. To the extent dissident elites exist, they and their views are unknown to others. If they came out as dissidents, they would be ejected from the elite.  Elon Musk is now finding this out and his dissident views are pretty minor.  I will be very surprised if Musk is not broke and in jail by the time they are finished with him.

                    Full stomachs account for much of the complacency, and those are going away as a matter of policy. The elites, as often happens, also have contracted the virus they helped to spread.

                    The Morpheus character inThe Matrix (1999)basically got it right about normies:“The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you’re inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.”

                    The last time I bought a gallon of paint thinner it was $5.99 at Menards in September, 2020. (I looked up the receipt online. And if we could post graphics here, I would post it.) I buy it again Saturday night for $22.96. Same store, same brand (Sunnyside), but they shrinkflated it by 16 oz. People are noticing stuff like that.

                “Our society is infected with a pathogenic virus in the form of human parasites.”The infected *are* the virus.  There is one potential solution—theoretical I admit—the removal of those infected from political society.  In short, the concept of “earned suffrage”.Folks who don’t contribute, or contribute very little, or have inability to contribute to society, do not captain the ship of state.  They may be allowed to partake to the limits of their contribution in society’s overall benefits, but they do not “run the show”.This is the only way to cull the herd—not some Pol Pot solution—just a quarantine, if you will, of those with the “virus”.  We don’t allow 10 yo’s to vote—not yet at least—because we still recognize an underdeveloped civic understanding.  Many other prohibitions can be named placed upon those not yet of our mythical “majority” age.  I say we replace that with standards of achievement/contribution to society.

                    UK is seriously considering allowing 16-17 year olds to vote. Several US localities reportedly are trying to allow non-citizens to vote. Seems suffrage is moving in the wrong direction. Alas I think ultimately any remedies will require TomA style actions. These should remain nebulous at the present time for what I’d hope should be obvious reasons. Perhaps that is all for the best, anyway. We cannot know the future. Fog of war and all that; we don’t even have the war yet, so how could we possibly have the fog?  Perhaps: make contingency plans yourself, be a bit discreet about whom you share them with, if anyone. You are the antibody. The most effective means to neutralize the infection are yours to choose.

                        No argument with TomA style actions being most likely to occur.  However, afterwards strict suffrage limitations will need to be applied in order to retain the gains made.  Such limitation will hopefully assure the parasites don’t revert us to the past, while assuring no individual or smallish group obtain absolute power.
In short, we don’t want democracy and we don’t want monarchy.

                    If democracy, as opposed to Our Democracy, is to have any hope of long-term success, the franchise must be very tightly restricted. Perhaps only 15 percent of adults should be allowed to vote. Having said this, if America had exerted demographic discipline, perhaps tight limitations on the franchise wouldn’t have been necessary.

Bingo! Yahtzee!  Yep,  we once had such innate demographic limitation, but failed to understand the benefit it brought us.  Hence we failed to protect it, and here we are today.

                    Even a low bar, like proof of paying at least $1,000 income tax in a year in order to be able to vote, would weed out many undesirables and give us better government. Just that measure alone would prevent rulers like Lula or the ANC from ever taking power.

                        I’ve often wondered if one couldn’t do something like you get 3 less votes than number of digits in your tax bill. Or maybe 5 less than the natural log of your tax bill, as someone paying $100k likely has more than triple the useful advice as someone paying only $1k.
But you need some kind of a log or root function to keep it from being just an oligarchy.

                            I probably favor a weighted voting system. The votes of those people we want to have the most electoral swat–married white men who earn good money, have high IQs and no or little criminal past–would be weighted much more than dumb, poor, single chicks, for instance. It might be a good idea to allow some questionable people to vote just to make them feel like they’ve got skin in the game, but to water down their electoral power to such a degree that they actually have the most minimal influence.

                    This is perhaps the ideal system. All of the advantages (and there actually are a few) of democracy but with most of the truly stupid and irresponsible excluded from politics. The problem is that you can’t get there from here. No one is going to propose this in the current system because it would be impossible to get enough people to vote for their own disenfranchisement.
I could see such a system being seriously considered but only after the kind of apocalyptic crisis in the current system that we would like to prevent.

                We cannot know how many will fight when the time comes because the pathogens own the MSM/social media and have a vested interested in keeping that information from us. Sowing doubt and despair is far more advantageous because it keeps a critical mass from recognizing that we are far more numerous than commonly assumed. My own sense is that a lot of people are seething below the surface and just waiting for a spark to ignite the inferno. And the danger is that that explosion of anger will be directed at convenient neighbors rather than the root problem. Congress cannot pass legislation to close the border, but they just passed a law banning ordinary citizens from knowing the flight paths of private jets. What does that tell you?

            You may well be right. However, if MacIntyre had proposed this, his book wouldn’t have seen the light of day, and if he self-published, his livelihood would have been retracted. But perhaps he should have done that anyway. For our movement to succeed, martyrs will be necessary and some people will have to make terrible sacrifices. But how many of us are willing to be martyrs? How many of us are willing to risk having to live in a cardboard box along an interstate?

        I look forward to the book and will buy and read it. As for this:That aside, another quibble is one it inherits from paleoconservatism and that is it cannot explain why managerialism exists. Burnham noticed that it first appeared in fascist systems. Later writers observed that communism was also good soil for the growth of managerialism. Now we see American-style liberal democracy has also been overtaken by bourgeois managers.The answer to the question is an unpleasant one. The Total State (a great phrase, btw) exists because people want it to exist, at least initially. The lesson I and so many others drew from Covid is that for the most part people are hopeless. Transparent lies, oppression and outright idiocy do not matter as long as a substantial portion of the populace can be made to feel safe and moral simultaneously. Communism, fascism and whatever this totalitarianism is spreading throughout the West meet a need that arises from weakness until disaster arrives.Things only change when the misery expands to the point there is nothing left to lose. It seems we are close to that happening. People like McIntyre are too little, too late to avoid what portends to be widespread pain for our people. It is still good to have them in place and railing against the day and to maybe point a few more in the right direction. There truly is no political solution to the darkness descending upon us, only survival and perhaps a post-collapse restoration of a few things of value. Let’s bear in mind “collapse” most likely isn’t Mad Max but the dysfunction rapidly spreading many times over. As we see repeatedly, the possibility of the lunatics in charge launching a nuclear war cannot be discounted, either.In the final analysis, the problem wasn’t the state. It was the people within it. If something is salvaged afterwards, vigilance will be necessary to avoid the same outcome or at least forestall it. I wouldn’t expect a different outcome for what follows.

            The reasons for the existence of the managerial state are really quite simple.1) Managerial types are very well organized. I mean this in the personal sense. They are the kind of people who can keep track of many things at once and enjoy doing it. Thus they tend to be elevated to administrative positions. Successful ones are also very good at networking and cultivating people who can help their careers.2) In addition, they have a herd mentality. They follow the prevailing ethos, whatever it may be, and regard independent thought with suspicion and hostility. They are “team players,” meaning they never contradict or oppose the received wisdom. They are shallow, superficial people who derive their identity from their positions within the institutions they serve.3) Along with herd mentality comes a very undeveloped sense of morality, tending to equate that which is moral with whatever is fashionable among their peers and betters within the managerial milieu. The heads of the organization say that we need to load x numbers of Jews onto boxcars. What is the most efficient way to do that and earn a gold star from my superior?4) The most successful of them combine cleverness and ruthlessness with the above qualities. Stalin was the archetypal managerial leader.People who do not have these qualities, for example, those who behave as individuals, or have actual compassion or strong morals, are at severe disadvantage in opposing managerial types, who quickly identify them and close ranks against them.The final element in their rise to power is the increasing centralization and complexity of modern society, which continually expands the number of positions in which such people can thrive and metastasize.Also, allow me to point out that the state always attracts people who seek power over others and unfair advantage. That’s a fundamental problem that can’t be fixed, made worse as a society becomes more corrupt, which of course is encouraged by the ruling class because it makes the masses easier to rule.

                Good summary. Hayek would emphasize the trading of individual freedoms as it’s gradually replaced by [corporate] state planning or rules (and, of course the personnel and power inevitably required for those.) Hayek, being an economist, often gives economic examples. In classic liberal times there is relatively little government oversight. Capitalists, whether the local tradesman or a factory owner, make most of the decisions of what goods and services to be offered, whom to hire, how to secure supplies, etc. As an administrative state grows, more and more of these powers are handed off to the planners who rule by government fiat. Does every man “have a right to a job”? Well, if that is true, then the labor market can’t be left up to the vagaries of the free market and evil capital. Instead, we now have an enlightened Ministry of Labor that will assign you the job you are most fit for, Citizen. You must accept it and do what you’re told, or else…Leviathan’s growth is often welcomed by citizens and even the favored businessmen. Less obvious is that these changes are far from all or nothing; there are infinite degrees of authority between laissez-faire and totalitarianism. The change might happen quickly or violently (e.g. Soviet Union, maybe Revolutionary France). But it could also happen over a period many years, decades even (e.g. Germany of late 19th century’s dramatic changes up through National Socialism, a period of only 2-3 generations.) Even “Democracies” like Hayek’s wartime Great Britain operated under authoritarian systems undreamt of except in wartime. A fairly aft metaphor would be that in many cases the tyranny is not imposed by force. The very citizens of a nation not only demand a prison be built, but they help design it, build it and operate it. Many of them actively volunteer to move into residence there, convinced (at least at first) that it’s the best of all possible worlds.

This explains why denial of mushrooming totalitarianism is so common. Most would-be critics quite often have been part of its implementation, mostly inadvertently, and it is hard to admit such a thing.

                        I have noticed that when one points out the facts that our society is rapidly devolving into a banana republic, that our elites are massively corrupt, people immediately become hostile. But except for elites and their running dogs (i.e. leftists) the reaction is not anger, but fear. One is forcing them to acknowledge something they know, but don’t want to think about, because it threatens the illusion that they are safe, which they are desperate to hang on to.

            It’s very hard to say if this problem would repeat itself in a system without Jewish access to power. In a fascist system, I’m not entirely sure what his basis for criticism is except maybe that in a meritocracy, upward strivers have a nervous and intemperate relation with power.
I’m personally unopposed to a mixed system where the state relies on some managers and some aristocrats for its leadership cadre, but things would have to be set up to not make that a source of tension in of itself.

                    There can be no question that AINO is a fascist state. The inextricable linkage of government, industry and the cultural institutions, as we see in AINO, are classically fascist. AINO also has a preferred people (negroes) and an enemy people (whites). Hell, AINO even has a hawkish foreign policy, although it prefers soft to hard imperialism. It’s all there. The former USA is the FSA, the Fascist States of America.

                            Thoughtful people on the DR advocate not for the Hitlerian National Socialist version of fascism but the Franco-Pinochet version.
The essential problem is that the fascist state already exists, and it is not going to devolve itself into an agrarian Jeffersonian republic.
Therefore the only relevant question is, will they control it, or will we?

                        It uses the same techniques of mass population control as fascism. Unlike fascism, it is not dedicated to benefit the people of a particular national state, but rather to spreading universal “democracy,” feminism, homosexuality, and consumerism.
Say what you will about Jonah Goldberg, but he was not wrong when he pointed out the similarities between the Wilson-FDR bureaucratic warfare state and fascist nations in his book “Liberal Fascism.”

                            Yes, what we have here is postmodern fascism–something de novo on the global scene. But you left out the one thing it is most intent on spreading, at least throughout the West–diversity.
An historian by the name of Leon Poliakov–a Finkel’s Finkel if their ever was one–inadvertently pointed up many similarities between the Nazis and the New Left in a book called The Aryan Myth. I suspect Goldberg mined that book pretty thoroughly for Liberal Fascism, although I don’t know if he gave Poliakov any credit.

                    Concur. Another takeaway from Hayek is that from his view in 1944, both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, although originating from vastly different premises were virtuallly indistinguishable in terms of the subjugation of the individual and the supremacy of State planning and power. I suppose, a case of form follows function.

                    Jack Dobson: “I don’t get the “passive” part from the photo, one of tens of thousands.”You’re absolutely correct.However, the damage wreaked by that particular  act of Active Aggression [levelling Gaza] was supposed to have functioned as a metaphor for the Passive Aggressive Bronze Age Death Cult having leveled the entirety of Western Civilization [in the abstract].A picture of a flesh &amp; blood human being having been trainwrecked by Passive Aggression might look something like…Or maybe like this…It’s not easy to illustrate [in drawings or paintings or pictures] precisely how Passive Aggression is destroying everything.It’s very easy for us to see the physical destruction of Gaza, as wreaked by the Bronze Age Death Cult.But it’s insanely difficult to see the psychological &amp; sociological deconstruction of Western Civilization, aswreaked by the Bronze Age Death Cult [i.e. Ne Plus Ultra Passive Aggression].

                            That’s leveled,Gaza?  Well, I must say that, if this is representative of the Israeli effort, then it surpasses photos of bombed out German cities I’ve seen. Really, in WWII photos you can actually see structural shells still standing.  This looks like a controlled demolition of structures for an urban renewal project.  In short, as has been rumored, the effort seems less to remove Hamas that to remove the Palestinians.

            Good points. As for the people… I have been saying too many people want to ride in the wagon and not enough want to pull it. The Plato death of democracy, voting oneself a raise and all.
I suspect things will disolve into some flavor of regional factionalism with strong local leadership post collapse.
I have been wondering if we will have electricity in the future. Seems doubtful.

                Electricity has been a widespread thing less than 125 years. The complex systems that require it not so much. Bill Gates blocking the sun with debris might kill millions if not billions. Loss of electricity to support our complex systems definitely will do so.

                    The book “One Second After” is about an EMP  taking out the American power grid. It’s pretty good. The ending is a bit optimistic but it is a novel.

            I might add, that with societal degradation speeding up, delay of completion of “the book” may mean *impossibility* of completion.  The thoughts you put down may well be passé before publication.  Publish first, then continue to revise as necessary.

        Yeah. Pretty common theme these last several years. Someone from more or less mainstream conservatism does that thing where they notice the thing, write up apretty gooddescription of the depth of the problem (avoiding that one thing that must be avoided because ofall those shoes) and pointing to absolutely no solution whatever. Vote harder, someone will save us, maybe this whole thing will just break itself.Someone observed that the main dividing line on our side is between the racist liberals (e.g. Steve Sailer: it’s the bleqs, and we need to get a coalition to vote to make things different) and the fascists, who understand that the whole thing has to be ripped out and salted over.

        If you follow Jeremy Carl’s “The Unprotected Class” to its logical conclusion even though the author shies away from his reporting, the destination of America is inevitably Rwanda circa April/May/June 1994. There can be only that ending to the central ideology of what animates Western Society: hate for YT. And it is completely entwined in the Managerial Class.It is probably better to ask, where does the Managerial State not exist? It seems not to exist much in Japan, in Latin America, and Russia and China. In the former, various political and cultural patronage networks prevent the Managers from achieving class domination and awareness. In Latin America it is corruption, crime, and poverty that acts as a barrier to Managerialism. In China, the CCP dominates all aspects of life and in Russia it is strong man rule.These places also don’t have the Managerial Pipeline: a hierarchy of universities giving managerial credentials of varying degrees of managerialness, and critically don’t have the AWFL domination of the university to managerial rule advancement.At to what is to be done, be ready to act when not if the balloon goes up. There are serious divisions among the elite. Not the least of which is the Green Idiocy which as currently implemented will make the nation a weak and easily defeated target for any opportunistic enemy.The enemy is both strong and weak. Strong in that Managers control everything, weak in that they are mostly gay or women. Princeton students, mostly Muslim women by their accents, recently blocked a Memorial Day Parade to honor fallen residents of the city. These are not people who are smart, or even understand the basics of America. The Columbia leader of the Palestinian movement / protests was some Filipino girl, the daughter of a semi-billionaire Philippines game show host. As far as I can tell, out of a desire for social status improvement.So in motivation: US, survival. Them: status improvement. See whose will to fight is stronger.

            I only can speak to Japan from the time I lived and worked there and it was some time back. You are close. Japan continues, albeit to a far lesser extent than in the past, to be a hierarchal and patriarchal society. The remnants of its rigid class system remain and Burakumin still are looked down on, for example. Of course, the Usual Suspects tried and for a while did push Japan into affirmative action and other destructive actions. Shinzo Abe tried to reverse some of that, and you know what happened to him. Japanese widely suspect the elements we routinely bemoan are behind it. But/for Japan’s own Forever Wars with Russia and China, it would have booted out the GAE some time back. The upper levels of the hierarchy remains ready to do if and when the opportunity presents. The push to flood Japan with “immigrants” likely has intensified that feeling although that part if conjecture on my part.

            Ok I’ll bite, what’s the problem with Curtis Yarvin? I think his understanding of political history is top-notch, and while his political theory (i.e. going back to some form of monarchism) may sound far-fetched at first glance, it does have some decent points; and he’s just as cutting as Z-man himself when it comes to pointing out the flaws of mainstream conservatism.

        The “State” is a very physically ugly group of people to look at, with a hand always in your pocket. Evildoers, that self-define as the ‘good people’ while marking you and yours as the opposite.Grandstanding, ever-present, braggarts, filled to the brim with threats.Personified by divorce lawyers that nudge their weak-minded female clientele, ‘you know’ maybe there was a little abuse… you know…’Ready to tell you what was ‘wrong’ with their first and second wives while seeking their third.Believe ‘business’ is providing the least, for the most as long as not sued or sued for more than is the ‘cost of doing business…’Rootless. Feral. Godless. Turn your neighbors against you.

        “MacIntyre cannot provide an answer for what to do about it…You cannot build a political movement on a foundation that calls for hiding out in the basement until the storm passes.”Yes, it all starts with us. At grassroots level. Small, determined, unglamorous decisions – from homeschooling to boycotting to refusing to join the military, to contributing small donations to activists like Rufo or Zman, the list is practically endless – which eventually add up to massive societal change. We don’t need some supposed strongman to swoop in and rescue us – how did Trump work out, after all? – we need to knuckle down and get the basics done in our own lives. And make converts!

        “…another quibble is one it inherits from paleoconservatism and that is it cannot explain why managerialism exists. Burnham noticed that it first appeared in fascist systems. Later writers observed that communism was also good soil for the growth of managerialism. Now we see American-style liberal democracy has also been overtaken by bourgeois managers. This is hardly an accident, but paleos have never produced an explanation for it.”The answer is that democracy, fascism and communism are all materialist, post-industrial political philosophies. As such there is more similarity between them than difference. The difference is essentially one of managerial technique in distributing the material goods of industrial civilization to urban, landless masses.Communism and democracy are similar insofar as they are universalist philosophies that pronounce man to be equal. Fascism differs insofar as it argues that men are not equal, and that the material goods of the industrial economy should be distributed to the people of the national state that produced them. Not for nothing did democracy and communism team up to defeat fascism.“That leads to another quibble that also comes from the paleo space. MacIntyre cannot provide an answer for what to do about it. He finished his book with three possible ends for The Total State. One is it staggers on due to a monopoly of power. Another is it is replaced by a strong man of some sort. The final option, the one MacIntyre prefers, is that it slowly dies from its own internal contradictions. Note that none of these lead to any action against the managerial system.”In all probability no action against the managerial system is possible. It is, after all, a totalitarian system. Perhaps the only real option would be to check out of the system as much as possible, and that would include renouncing the material benefits the system provides.Like the early Christians confronting Rome, the only way forward is to build a subterranean, parallel society that simply rejects the values and principles of the Empire. (Frankly the hippies of the Sixties were in a similar situation with regard to the Establishment).In his excellent book “The Long March: How the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s Changed America,”(ISBN 1-893554-30-9) author Roger Kimball cites Paul Weyrich as proposing the “opt out, take to the hills” option as perhaps the only alternative for the Right. Weyrich observed that there was no actual “moral majority” any more, and that political action to restore conservatism was futile.Kimball’s book is a bit dated (published in 2000) but entirely worth it, you won’t regret reading it at all.

        I don’t want to be too negative about MacIntyre, because anything that introduces Normie to Carl Schmidt is objectively a good thing. However, this ground was better plowed by Neema Parvini’s “The Populist Delusion”, without any Panglossian implications that we can vote our way out of this. Only a revolutionary circulation of elites will suffice.This is why all of these popular press books ultimately fail. The authors cannot advocate systemic revolution and maintain their legacy media access, so they all invariably punt.Yarvin was important at one time as a “gateway”, but his relevance has diminished as he has become more of a gatekeeper.

            Parvini Rug Emporium and Trivium While U Wait has the right of it. This (officially at least, and probably anyway) is a long-haul, multi-generational thing and there can be no easy quick fixes. Local resistance, parallel institutions, etc. are all good and necessary, but the necessary circulation of elites is another thing entirely and without it, you’re left with Trump and MAGA sorts flailing around not knowing how to grasp the levers of power whilst slurping their peas off their knives with caps on backwards.As for prescriptive dicta, Parvini &amp; Co appear to subscribe to the First Rule of Fight Club. The fact that Yarvin and BAP do not is ample proof that they are clowns and distractions.

        “All within the state.  Nothing outside the state.  Nothing against the state.” – Benito Mussolini
That pretty much sums things up, today.  And that guy died 79 years ago.
Liberals fixated on mustache man and fascism are just doing what they always do: telling us who they are and what their objective is.
People have trouble defining the total state, but the fascists through Il Duce had a pity definition that I’ve always used.

        “That aside, another quibble is one it inherits from paleoconservatism and that is it cannot explain why managerialism exists.”I think Quigley does a good job of this. I quoted him at length a while back on here. Tragedy and Hope, chapter XVI, The New Age.“That leads to another quibble that also comes from the paleo space. MacIntyre cannot provide an answer for what to do about it.”“The final option, the one MacIntyre prefers, is that it slowly dies from its own internal contradictions.”Imo, the vaxx. Drinking the kool aid. Call me a nut job lol. If anything could engender distrust in authority, it’s people dying. Or, you know, a farm needs livestock, a cult needs believers.

                Either inflation or deflation* is the end. The GAE (albeit diminished) can likely stagger on through anything else**. It’s all about the money. The narrative about the collapse of the USSR, for some inexplicable reason, usually tends to ignore the 300% inflation at the end.
*Deflation had a go at it in the 1930s but things held together. There’s books about it
**barring asteroid strikes, yellowstone caldera, nukes etc.

            You wrote thatHan-Chinese knows what nature of Jewish are, and how to deal with them.The history of Maoism suggests otherwise.In fact, 85 to 90% of the foreigners helping the Chinese at the time of the Communist takeover were Jewish.We’re all familiar with the general features of what followed the Maoist takeover. So it looks like many Han were played for fools bysome peoplewho wanted to subvert and destroy the cultural basis of an independent Han people. This is how the suspects have rolled for thousands of years, doing so directly or through proxies.The destruction was, possibly, less extreme among the nationalists who fled to Formosa, but these are being corrupted by Americanism and globohomo, diseases with more than their fair share of the usual suspects in positions of power and influence. Now mainland Han have Xi Jinping Thought to lead them to the glorious future. Xi has prescribed a program of national rejuvenation by renewing and intensifying the commitment to the revolution that was carried out under the influence of people whom you say the Han know how to deal with.

        A brief comment here that really doesn’t have much to do with the subject of the article.Yoram Hazony’s National Conservatism is, I think, a horrible “remaking” of American “conservatism” or the American right. If one reads through his book, he basically repudiates every historical American on the right. I find no value in his work at all. It simply seems like another effort by Republican party politicos to corner the American right in a Republican party myth.

At least three questions ought to be asked about the principals and their objective. Examples:
• Whose nation?• What is to be conserved?• What are the good reasons for conserving that?• What are the other reasons?• Who arethe ringleaders?• Whose money pays for it?• How did the payers obtain their money?
