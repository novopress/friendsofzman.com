        Derb is good but he is a throw back to the time when rational debate and sound arguments might have won the day.  No more to that.  Trying to argue with a lefty wokester that un-checked immigration damages the poor more than the rich by the use of charts, tables, statistics, is a pointless endeavor.
McMartin pre-school case was the hysteria of the early 80s. Reading that will make you hate legal authorities and social workers even more.  They destroyed lives over baseless allegations.
Good show.

        Well these corrupt lawfare chit shows have an excellent historical precedent:
The boys show up in the middle of the night at the residence of the corrupt judge – haul him out of bed and then kick, punch, slap and drag him out to a waiting paddy wagon… and he disappears!
I swear I am going to buy that rotten tee shirt they had years ago with a pic of You-Know-Who on it, captioned “what about all the GOOD things Hitler did?”

        Haven’t read his pessimism book but some of my favorite Derbyshire short columns, off top of head, were: The Hidden Hand of EFTA; Useful Idiots; United States of Islam; Sad, Mad, Bad; The Cant of Our Age; The Geology of Chaos… Many 30-second bits from his radio show (mostly British literary anecdotes I’d never know otherwise) come back to me occasionally, but honestly never enjoyed that info-nugget style– it worked tonally because it was so awkward in contrast to the piety/self-seriousness of Nat Review Online.

        It is truly a shame Derb didn’t marry a white woman. By marrying an Asian he didn’t get to experience the character building experience of being married to a fat white woman who divorce raped him.

            It’s not like marrying an East Asian woman is future proof. Most go *poof* within a couple of years, six if no kids are involved and they couldn’t get their personal hangups resolved.

                Dumb argument. It’s akin to the argument you hear all the time from normie, “not ALL kids raised in single family households end up messed up.” “Not ALL blacks are involved in crime.”
OK…what’s more statistically probable? Scale matters.

                    I don’t think you are disagreeing with @Forever, that marrying outside race solves any problems with marital stability.
That matches what I’ve seen with Egyptian and Persian women, BTW. Once the “sistahs” have told them the legal system here allows them to live the high life while their ex-men live in their hatchbacks, it’s bar the door.

            Counter-argument: There are (I suspect) a substantial population of (older) Philippine, Korean and Japanese divorced women who married a U.S. service man, popped out a few kids, divorced the poor SOB and profited handsomely. Oh yes, they obtained U.S. citizenship. They’ve managed to import a substantial number of their relatives since. Great system!

        I am a big fan of Derb, have been for years. 20+ years ago when I used to subscribe to National Review the first thing I would do when it came in the mail was turn to the last page to read his column.He’s witty, good-natured, erudite, and highly intelligent. A true polymath with an inquisitive mind — he knows a lot of things about a lot of subjects. And asks the right questions.Some of the contemporary white nationalist people rag on him for being a Boomer, having an Asian wife, and for not Naming the Jew, but that’s unfair. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for noticing politically incorrect things, and for sticking his neck out — and paying the price. All of us on the dissident right were “mainstream conservatives” once, and over time we have all been red-pilled — as was he.I’ve corresponded with him briefly, and he once cited something I’d published. I was very honored by that. He’s a good guy.It gives me a bit of pause to think that I’ve been reading him for probably 25 years. When I started reading his stuff, he was younger than I am now.Damn…tempus fugit. We’re all getting old. This has been a decades-long fight. Strange to think how long we’ve all been at it.

        I learned a couple of things from John Derbyshire. John was the first person I ever heard to express the thought that the white people of the United States have always been engaged in a cold civil war against each other from almost the beginning of its founding. This explained a lot. The second thing that I learned from John was that the Bible tells us not to despair. And that it is a sin.I think that will be a comforting thought in the days ahead. Thanks Mr. Derbyshire.

        I yield to no man in my admiration for, and gratitude to, Derb.  He is polymath, iconoclast and down-to-earth gentleman.  I once had the pleasure of buying him a whiskey and thanking him.However, my fundamental disagreement with him is about whether the white world is effectively controlled by an alien group, and if so, who is to blame.While he resists the idea that whites are under alien occupation, he believes that if we are, then it is our own fault.  He has written a number of times, I’m paraphrasing, “If 2% of our population can take control of our country then the people are to blame.”My reply:  Sure, it’s our own fault that we have been dominated by a small tribe.  But having conceded that, what do we do now?That alien group dominates whites by exploiting our collective gullibility and compassion via near-hegemonic control of the media and finance.  We can be disgusted with whites that they are unable to recognize and break free of this exploitation, but clearly most just can’t.  It’s just beyond their capabilities.Given that, do we just abandon our people in disgust?While Derb simply blames whites for their vulnerabilities, I counter, “We must set white people free by destroying the system that keeps them in this psychological subjugation.”  I know, easier said than done.  But I don’t see any alternative that doesn’t lead to being a hated minority world-wide.

            Though Anglosphere conservatives always lose, only lose, and will never countenance anything but losing, the boomer right’s attachment to conservatism is an identification with winners. When they were kids, ruling-class WASPs and the smart guys on TV were Republicans. Denouncing their own race as a loser race, their own children as a loser generation, the people of their own countries as economic losers to superior immigrants and/or international finance, etc., etc., conserves their self-image. There’s nothing else they truly value. Derb is the last Derbyshire who’ll know the significance of his name.

                The Zoomers still value hard cash. There’s that.
Liberated by their 401(k) plan, ensconced in their golf cart on the private course, they yawn and celebrate the sunny new day. Unlike the younger generations, whose rent payments just doubled, Mr. and Mrs. Zoomers still have their fully-paid-down suburban home to go to. They enjoy the full expanse of the pharmaceutical industry, not forgetting the Viagra. (Mrs. Zoomer, post-Wall, is not the fetching piece of ass she once was.)
Things are good for the Zoomers. Aside from that little fate coming up called DEATH.

            Redcoats versus the Continental Army. I know the true story is more complex, but what we learned in school was that the Redcoats stood in proper formation, followed all the rules, and prided themselves on their discipline. The continental army ran around more like a guerilla army and ran rings around them.That’s how we got infiltrated and controlled by Jews. They’re crooks. Look how they manipulate the law. Then you have blackmail via Jeffrey Epstein and his predecessors.That’s how they ended up controlling us and hoovering up billions. Too bad we don’t have our own Putin to roll that all back. Russia hasn’t suffered after running it’s oligarchs off. In fact, they prospered.

            If we can’t get our youth out of the consume, consume, consume, now, now, now mentality so common to the melanin-enhanced, you are probably right. People rightfully note that was common to many, maybe most of my generation. Thing is, the consequences of a higher (shorter) time preference were not quite as dire. Or at least might not be.
I don’t know what religious persuasion most of you are, but the Bible (particularly Proverbs) is pretty harsh on spendthrifts. If you are spending like a drunken Congress, you aren’t exactly living the life He desires.

                So, the problem with whites is simply gluttony?  There’s nothing larger, on a structural level, going on?
If whites would stop eating fast food and reign in some of their frivolous purchases, then we’d be fine?
Oh, how I wish you were right, but I fear that it’s much worse than you suppose.

                    No, as I said, the consequences of screwing up now are worse. For example, student loans are not dischargeable. Yet they seem to be “forgivable” at least if you meet certain Deep State criteria. Whites not in government jobs need not apply.Interest rates, whether for money markets, home mortgages, credit cards, etc. are not vastly different than the 80s and 90s. I took out an 8.5% student loan my freshman year, and we seriously considered an assumable 8.9+% mortgage, more than 1.5% points above current rates.I let one of the other guys do the counseling the other day. One of the guys coming to the church for financial assistance sincerely believed he needed 3 smartphones, one for his family and friends, one for work, one for girls. He also had his internet connection and various streaming subscriptions, all of which were essential. I get it, NAXALT, right?My daughter despairs of ever finding someone competent enough to understand what the gauges mean on a battery charger, or how to save money by doing brakes at home. She’s taught those skills to ex-boyfriends, boys who should have learned that shit from dad, if anyone from either generation actually cared. In one case, her BF’s dad was interested in learning how to do basic car repair, but the BF himself couldn’t care less.It’s not all gloom and doom. I’d guess a good 10% are interested in being good male role models, which is, at a guess, roughly what it was for my generation, too. Major difference being my generation didn’t expect an X studies (or even liberal arts) degree would pay the bills.

            TMI:
I just remembered that the one asian girlfriend that I ever had, back in the 2000s, bought me Derb’s book on algebra as a gift.  Somehow appropriate.
(After 6 months, she abruptly switched from sweetly submissive to dragon lady.  I laughed and wished her good luck.)

        I have mixed feelings about Derb. On the one hand, he’s a bold man who is more than willing to criticize black behavior, even when it results in personal harm. On the other hand, his constant idolization of Asians and Jews is frustrating as Hell. He’s done a lot of good to bring people in, but his attitudes have to be a phase. You really can’t consider yourself pro-White if you’re constantly lifting other races up on a pedestal.

            And as for marrying an Asian chick… I’m a hopeless romantic, so I have trouble rooting against love. But the marriage should have been sterile (like Howard Lovecraft and Sonia Greene). If you’re siring mixed children, you’re actively contributing to an anti-white future.

        “The Derb” is a street fighting man, and a class act. He takes a lot of heat fron his own fans over on Unz because he won’t hammer on the Jews every column, all column, and because he married an Asian. Who gives a rats ass! I blew off Unz because most of the commentariat are total nut jobs. He’ll always have my respect.
Salute… to “The Derb” 🥃🥃🥃

            I’m conflicted about both those things. On the one side, “da joos” does get tiresome and -especially- at Unz because it is omnipresent. I don’t think –every– columnist needs to cover the elephant in the room. If it were underrepresented there, then I’d be more inclined to pull him up on it. But at Unz I’d say its slightly overrepresented if anything.But, conversely, they can be sourced tomany(most?) of our modern ills in some form or fashion. So again, conflicted…As for the 2nd item, a bit less conflicted. You cannot really be a race realist and then miscegenate with a bug lady. That being said, again, there is some nuance. Western women have become largely intolerable, so I get the want to be away from their absurdly high levels of unearned self-esteem and comical demands. But! You also now have a hapa kid. If female—&gt; Kristin Kreuk is a potential outcome, so that’s ok right? If male—&gt; Elliot Rodger is a potential outcome. Not so good… .🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

                I’m all about the Jew problem. One of the draws of Unz was it was a place you could openly discuss it. It’s a problem.  But that’s ALL they freaking talk about now. Used to be a good mix of the Jew problem with  other interesting content. Those days are gone.Last time I checked in a few months ago, every featured article was “the Jews.”Fuck that!

                    UNTRUE: “I’m all about the Jew problem.”You’re a Constitution nut, too. Remember?Now, since we’re on a favorite topic, let’s inquire into your limited understanding of it. Tell us how that preamble could have ever been true. Fewer than ½ of the inhabitants of the thirteen had anything to do with establishing that mess called a constitution. Less than one half.You are required by the text to believe, however, that “the” people ordained and established the Con. The phrase “the People” means every man, both retard and not. It means every woman, both lewdite and not. It means every child, both speaking and not yet speaking. This is the plain meaning of the words.In Rhode Island, however, a few folks more courageous than you said NFW to “We the People”. More than 75% of the electorate rejected the Con when the document was subjected to an unconstitutional referendum in 1788. Voters said no to the new populist fraud—one not unlike Ex. 20:18-19, and for a brief period they succeeded.So how did the preamble become true? And when, exactly, was that?

                Well said. I enjoyed UNZ for years. Sailer went off the rails, cares only for baseball stats, golf course architecture, and Hollywood gossip. He’s also obsessed with the enemy NY times.Ground breaking work on HBD, yet is a civnat wtf?Lots of great contributors over there and some reasonable / astute commenters.That said, it’s now too small hat centric. Especially with the Israeli / Hama’s drama.It’s was a lot nicer when it was a “secret corner” of the internet.

            ‘“The Derb” is a street fighting man…”  Literally.  He’s the bloke in the striped shirt.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BdJ3YR6EvMDerb said that Bruce Lee instructed him, “Look at me like I just fVcked your wife.”What a life this guy has lived.  Sure, we can regret his entanglement with asians, but as he has recounted, all the young of his generation believed that all the races would unite in harmony.  It was the wisdom of the age.He made his marital decisions under those beliefs and stood by them in a manly way, even as all of those decisions were discredited.  Would you have done anything differently if you were born in his time?

                I do not have issue with Derb marrying an Asian. I said he takes an unwarranted beating for it at UNZ. He lived there, met her shit happened.He did it long before the MGTOW cope of marrying Asian women.He didn’t go to an Asian country seeking an Asian wife as a work around.My uncle met and married a Korean women when he was stationed there in the early 70’s USAF. She’s as American as apple pie.

            There’s writing and then there’s writing. In my (admittedly, thankfully) brief exposure to her music, I didn’t hear any instruments, just computers. Which was no doubt how most of the music was “written.” The software is so user friendly you don’t even need a keyboard, just click or swipe. No instruments required, nor ability to play them.

        Derb deserves appreciation. I understand his health is not good, so prayers for his health could not hurt. He stuck his neck out when it was neither easy nor cost free to do so.
Derb also has been targeted by the Regime and that is no joke. If he was not considered a hostile threat the targeting would not have happened.

                We started a shift to pointing out who was writing the columns, and who was paying them.  eg Mona Charen was a Bushie.
Hard to believe that was 12 years ago.  2012 was the same year Mitt Romney was forced on us, and it was the election that red pilled at LOT of us.
That was the year I crossed the river and never looked back.

                    I heard Mitt Romney being interviewed by Sean Hannity a couple of times on the radio. He’s got a tremendous amount of personal charisma that he kept hidden from the general public. I gladly voted for him at the time. It was McCain I resented being forced on me.

                        Mittens was the best choice in 08 and 12.  In 08 I remember him talking about immigration enforcement and pushing the self deportation idea for illegals. It was probably an act but at least he was talking about it.  Huckabee the huckster and McStain were both pro amnesty.

        I do see why so many people find it painful that we may be alone in the universe. This assumption that therehasto be intelligent alien life out there rarely is challenged. Frankly, being somewhat skeptical by nature, I have serious doubts that there are any alien visitations to this planet for all the reasons treated in other comments. It’s pretty obvious why the UFO cult has such a grip on our imagination, the main one being that we need something or someone to save us from ourselves, kind of like the Qanon stuff. The classic sci-fi expression of this thinking was the filmThe Day the Earth Stood Stilland the mysterious phrase “Klaatu barada nikto”.I do agree that we need a savior however to tame the wicked heart of Man. Whether you’re a Christian or not doesn’t matter. This yearning goes deep into the psychology of human beings. Modernity unleashed a genie that cannot be put back into the bottle. The Globalists present their solutions but it is a nightmare world they offer us, truly Luciferian. Anyway, “Klaatu barada nikto,” which after exhaustive research I have finally translated: “Have a great weekend.”

                “The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.”― H.P.

            Right now, today, on a chair or in a bed somewhere, is someone so painfully alone that he will complete today, tomorrow, and next week, and many days after having not spoken to another human being.
Many of our belief systems are simply a battle against loneliness.
The UFO/alien phenomenon or religion or whatever (I WANT to believe.) is just another quest in search of place and meaning and salvation.  “This just can’t be all there is.”
What if we already live in Paradise?  How would we know?

        Well, these days a lot of people want to talk about Israel and the fact that they are dropping American-made bombs on women and children, and opening fire on starving people looking to get food.
As someone commented yesterday, dropping bombs on people is what governments do. Unless you are ready to drive government to extinction, you are going to get increasingly efficient ways of killing civilians.
Interestingly, Porretto covered that same point this morning at libertystorch dot com.

                And it need not necessarily be bombs. I think there has been little as effective in terms of destroying lives, and maybe even killing people, than the COVID response and jabs.
Or those whose lives will be destroyed by green energy. Or who might lose them.
Or illegal immigration.
They just don’t give a fuck about anyone living here. Or anywhere, for that matter.

        I keep up with the hurricane forecasting, probably something to do with living on the gulf coast, and I can tell you that Colorado State University and one or two others do a reasonably accurate job of predicting the number of named storms per year and number of major storms. Of course Michael Mann is a quack, by definition someone who sues someone over wrongthink has to be, but that doesn’t mean the science of seasonal hurricane forecasting is out to lunch.One thing that has inflated the number of named storms in recent years is better technology. There are a lot of “fish storms” that form and die way out to sea, barely above the threshold to qualify for a name, that in years past never would have been much noticed, but today they qualify as named storms.I have never, or almost never, seen a paywalled news story that wasn’t available for free athttps://archive.is/A very long and thought provoking piece that suggests that our “aliens” may come from under the sea rather than from beyond the starshttps://barsoom.substack.com/p/devil-worshipping-aliens-from-dimension. But I’m more of a Project Blue Beam guy myself.I used to think of it as a point of pride that I didn’t know a single Taylor Swift song, but perhaps I’m not so uniqueIn the great internet crackdown that’s coming, I have this idea that there will be reluctance to go after relatively obscure race realists, since what they propagate is so verboten, so “triggering,” that they’d be terrified to give it a public hearing lest anyone suffer trauma.

            The story I always repeat is that after Katrina the cranks went into overdrive saying that this was the new normal, that Cat 6 hurricanes would ravage the coast to the point that the living would envy dead in places like Florida.  Of course the next year zero hurricanes hit the U.S. and they disappeared back into their dumpsters.

                It was confirmed for me that Gorebull Warning was a complete crock of bull when I saw a trailer for An Inconvenient Truth and it showed a clip of Katrina slamming the Gulf Coast. It wasn’t an unusually strong hurricane (Cat 3) when it made landfall and the reason why it was so disastrous for New Orleans is because the levees failed.

            That was the theme in Gary North’s 1985(-ish) “Unholy Spirits.” He argued that paranormal phenomena (ghosts, miracle healings, UFOs, in general any inexplicable stuff) was absolutely real but was evidence of demons intended to lead humans astray. This was quite a departure for North who while not a household name, had been moderately successful as a “hard money” investment writer in the 70s-80s. He also wrote on history and religion, if I recall correctly.

        Potpourri podcast. Lawfare and drones.Now that sanctions have lost their luster as a means of destroying nations such as Russia, the Deep State has chosen to change tactics and move to a smaller pond. Hence the lawfare scourge that currently afflicts us. Same idea, use institutional mechanisms to bully the deviants into toeing the line or subservience. And it will only get worse until the perps have skin in the game.Which brings us to drones. None other than Elon Musk himself has put out a video detailing that modern drone technology can soon become a Pandora’s Box. How is that you ask? Every cell phone possesses a high resolution camera and facial recognition software (cheap, abundant, and ubiquitous). Marry that capability with a small cheap drone and some AI software, and you get a nasty hunter-seeker right out of the Terminator movie franchise.What happens when you break civil trust comprehensively and the judicial system becomes a bad joke? And what happens to societal evolution when vigilante accountability become a hobby or sport as a result?

Wonderful, wonderful things. As near utopia as we can aspire to in this life.
There’s a reason Jim Bell’s AP was as thoroughly scrubbed as it was, far better than was believed possible in the “wild west” of the early internet.

                    Called himself a crypto-anarchist or something like that. His page on wiki gives you the basics, but so far as I know, all you can find out about AP is commentary about it. I’m certain it must still exist somewhere out there, but it’s not easy to find. They did a good job scrubbing it.

        Just to note as I just saw several more examples of this, this morning, but the use of “filters” by TikTok streamers is kind of a harbinger of the “AI” video as well.  The video link below has some examples but I see thisall the timeto the point that any video or picture of woman cannot be trusted at all:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw2euJzOk60Also saw an example where, of course, the “woman” wasn’t even a woman at all.

            The techies here already know this, but you can download an ap on your phone camera that can change your sex and make you into a gorgeous woman or a woman into an Alpha male. My son was showing me this a few months ago. We had a lot of laughs with it. The best it could do with me was lop off about 40 years and turn me into your typical frumpy middle-school principal.
I have a theory that this type of ap is fueling a lot of the transgender stuff.

        Re: Aliens.It depends on whether you believe the drops from Q are legit and coming from close to Trump or not. I believe that is the source for the recent snowballing of interest. I happen to believe the drops are legit, but written in such a way that we don’t really know their true meaning until it’s revealed later. Plus, Q admitted that  “disinformation is necessary” so not everything that was dropped, if anything, is going to be correct.Q’s drop on aliens: “We are not alone … Think of the vastness of space.”I was watching a documentary on the Varginha UFO incident in Brazil called “Moment of Contract.” It seemed interesting and plausible, but I’m a natural skeptic. But then I heard an interview with the filmmaker James Fox and he sounds like he could be legit. He didn’t sound like a scammer or a crook.We also have those UFO videos that were released by the military.Who knows? As with all this stuff, I just take it all in. I do tend to believe that it’s impossible to be alone given the vastness of the universe. It may have to do with different dimensions existing at the same time, kind of like TV. We might be Channel 6 kind of the aliens might be Channel 10. i wouldn’t put money on any of this stuff though.

                    I felt so bad for my Qanon family members.  So I started writing down their predictions or I’d go back to a post from 6-8 months prior and ask, “So, did this ever pan out?”
Took awhile, but they came around.

                        Don’t feel bad for me. I think it’s coming along rather nicely myself. Look at how far the Overton window has moved on a number of issues. It’s not going as fast as we want, that’s for sure, but we’re moving in the right direction.

            Space flight is really, really hard, especially interstellar space travel. I’ve always had a hard time to believing anyone who mastered it would come here just to buzz a few fighter pilots and anal probe a few winos.
I suspect if the aliens ever do arrive, we’ll know all about it in no uncertain terms.

                Exactly. They would be doing a whole lot more than playing peek-a-boo.
As far as QAnon goes, no I do not “trust the plan”. However whatever it is do seems to be right on with the prevalence of pedophilia among our “elites.”

                Well, if they really are ET then they would obviously possess the technology to make themselves invisible to us if they wished. Which raises the question, since they have chosen not to cloak themselves, why not just pull the ol’ flying saucer into a Sonic and say  “Hahdee, y’all!”?

                Bruno, you are arrogant indeed to claim that space flight, especially interstellar travel, is really really hard. By our standards yes, and I note that if we are talking about live passengers, interplanetary is not on the menu, much less to the stars. I’d call it “arrogant” to make a blanket claim about other civilizations, of which we know nothing at all. There might be none, or there might be countless other intelligences in our Really Big Universe.Now having admonished him for stepping out of line, I conclude with an attempt at humor.Back in the early 80s there was a stand up comedian (forget whom) who made a very similar comment (approximately): “Did you ever notice that when aliens want to make contact with humans, they always seem to choose some rednecks way out in the woods in an off-road vehicle with a twelve pack?”

        What happens if deepfake audio is run through an analog medium?  Create the fake audio then play it through a speaker and have a cassette recorder with  DC biasing  (adds a lot of noise and nearly all cheap cassette recorders use it) and microphone to record the deepfake onto cassette and play the cassette back through the input of the computer and save it to a wave file.  The resulting wave file will be nothing like the original wave form generated by the AI.Would it still be detectable as fake?  The noise generated by the cassette recorder and microphone picking up surrounding noise  will add authenticity to the recording.  Anything above like 10khz (5khz with a really cheap recorder) will be cut off by a cheap cassette recorder so embedded high frequency fingerprints will not work.Another mix of old and new technology will be when someone figures combining full self driving with improvised explosive devices with GPS triggering (FSD + IED = chaos).

            Should be able to isolate fingerprints of having done that. That’s one of the reasons the really good mixing and mastering engineers still use at least a hardware compressor, limiter or even EQ at the end of the processing chain. Even then, real audiophiles claim to be able to tell the difference between and analog and a digital master. I don’t know. I can’t hear it. But the answer to that is to stack hardware post-DAW. After about a half-dozen boxes, you can probably conceal not only which boxes were used, but also that any were used at all.Used to be you could add enough 60 Hz hum to confuse it, but now that fluorescent lighting is dying off, it’s hard to credibly make it sound like noise rather than signal.

                Well, yes, that’s the point. You say the original was recorded by a cassette recorder and not created on a computer. That’s why all the noise is there. That’s why it cuts off at 5-10khz.  It will be hard to deny that the audio at a minimum took a trip outside the computer world and then imported back in.  Possibly, it will be impossible to say the file originated from anything but an analog device.  Plus you will still have the tape and the tape recorder.  You can say you recorded the whole thing with the tape.Whether or not fingerprinting can be captured and reproduced by a poor quality cassette recorder with wow and flutter and the noise of DC biasing (plus the ssss sound with every S as an example) and a low frequency cutoff is anyone’s guess.  Not knowing much about it, I don’t know how they were able to prove the recording was AI generated.  I just know you can both purposefully and accidentally do some real weird stuff with good old fashioned analog technology.I take everything “audiophiles” say with a giant grain of salt.  These people were literally buying audiophile grade SD cards. They think putting a magic marker line on a CD will improve the sound.

            There was a story that just came out today. A few months ago audio of a principal of a school in Baltimore came out and he was ranting about his students and teachers and calling them gamer words. He got put on leave, but swore he didn’t say it. Well, it turns out he didn’t, it was AI, and it was the athletic director of the school trying to retaliate for a disciplinary action.The articles talk about how LE figured it out because of AI “fingerprints” but in the end they traced it back to the guy’s Gmail account. I don’t know what those fingerprints are, but the AI is advancing rapidly. It’s easy when the faker is a moron like in this case, but I think we are getting into a world where anyone who puts his or her foot in mouth will just blame it on an AI recording.

            Already in the news:https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/disgruntled-school-employee-uses-ai-frame-principle-racist-rantPardon if this was already posted in today’s blog. I know there was recent discussion of the issue, but I cannot recall where. But mentioned there (I paraphrase):If a Black athletic director at a public school who we can safely assume is not, shall we say, a technical wizard, could produce a fake that caused so much harm, just imagine what tools already are available in the hands of talented amateurs, not to mention professionals whether in the entertainment or criminal/intelligence dirty tricks labs.I recall some pundit, decades ago predicting that in the future digital fakery (audio, video stills or motion, what-have-you) might become so good that it would become inadmissible in court; in other words, that it would approach impossible to tell real from fake. Will justice return to sworn eyewitness or other “analog” testimony, even with all its known shortcomings? Maybe.In the future, I’m sure at some dramatic trial the defense will produce a high-res video of (say) the judge playing beach volleyball with the members of the jury. This will be entered into evidence. The defense will argue that this video would pass nearly any authenticity checks, and more important to the matter, is that they could have created any scenario they wished, whether a Sunday picnic or a Roman orgy.

        Rick Beato has an interesting take on Taylor Swift. He points out that while she sells a lot of music, it’s rare to meet anyone actually into Taylor Swift. She’s become something of the world’s biggest cult act.It makes sense. In the 1960’s you had three sets of charts, pop, country and black. Since then, music has become so specialized and customized that you now have artists that sell millions of streams, but most of us wouldn’t know them if they dropped dead in front of us.Also, the experience of consuming music has changed. Rather than having to purchase individual physical media, you pay your $10 a month and get an unlimited selection. If I’m curious about Taylor Swift, it doesn’t cost me anything more than I’ve already spent to give her album a spin. Obviously, that changes the economics from when you had a 14-year-old kid deciding between spending his lawn mowing money on a Beatles or a Rolling Stones album.As to her popularity, I’ve read that her lyrics reflect “the internal dialog going on inside every woman’s head”. Make of that what you will.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRAYW0toFiI

            Long live the CD!   I will not pay real money for a virtual product.  I want something physical in my possession which works independently of some website, app or IP address. Something real I can buy, sell or trade.I will never buy any physical product that needs an app to work.  I’m into retrogaming and retro computing. My idea of value is not 3-5 years before a website disappears or an app is no longer maintained and not compatible with the latest phones.  There are physical things costing more than a thousand dollars that require an app and require an app for no real good reason.  Not only do you have to worry about obsolescence, but every app wants access to everything in your phone.All this crap has turned me into a quasi-Luddite.  I’ve been into tech all my life and work in tech.  But I also hate it.  They make everything shitty and worse.  Who in god’s name wants a toaster that connects to the internet for some reason?  Now you cannot even avoid this by buying products that don’t claim to be smart.  There are chips now in everything that can create ad-hoc networks and connect to the internet via an IOT node, like a refrigerator or even some routers, even if the nearest node is a long way away.  It can connect to a device 1/2 way down the street, which can then connect to another device a further 1/2 way down the street.  Ad-Hoc networks can get very physically large.  It’s all done invisibly and cannot be disabled.  Many of these devices that don’t need it now have speakers, which can operate as a microphone.The worst part is nobody cares.

                I wholeheartedly agree, Tars. If you “own” something that exists only digitally, the Evil Ones can take it away from you if they conclude it contains wrongthink. I’ve never purchased any digital product, but I do have a nice library of CDs, DVDs and physical books. The only way anybody is taking those away is at gunpoint. Then, too, as you say, there’s something a little extra about being able to hold an item in your hands.As for small appliances, I get them from antique stores. The last thing I want is Mr. Sha’Quand’rius Coffee listening to make sure I don’t drop an N-bomb while I’m eating breakfast.

                    I’m as materialistic as the next guy, but my experience with audio media is diametrically opposite yours.In my teens-30s I amassed a sizeable LP, cassette and eventually CD collection. Around 2000 I gave away my LPs and the friend gave them back! I finally was able to foist them off on a 2nd friend and they stayed gone. The cassettes went for free to a taker on Freecycle. Some years later, the CDs had long been digitized and were gathering dust. I was able to give them to my then house cleaner. And even she offered to give them back a few years later.Owning the physical good ahs its good points, but for media I’m a PC file based guy now. Most of my media is in my own possession under my own control so not subject to the whims of the Central Scrutinizer. I’m aware of the risks though, since I’ve bought a few – just a few – Amazon e-books, Google Play store apps that later vanished, etc.

                Honestly, all content should be free, but it should be encoded with something that the computer will know whether you are a subscriber or not. If you are a subscriber, it plays commercial free or reduced commercials AFTER the song or video plays. If you are not a subscriber, you still get to watch it, but you also watch commercials as part of the deal.

                The flipside is that someone like Spotify would have saved me hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars on CDs when I was growing up. In that case would have put that money to much better use.
Though, it would be fair to say that I could have exercised more fiscal discipline, had better priorities, and found ways to save money.

                    When I was a teenager I used to borrow albums from the library and then copy them to cassette tape.  Later on, my circle of friends would all buy a CD and each of us would copy all the CDs the others bought.  Frankly, I wish I still had all those tapes. My car got broken into and hundreds of tapes stolen.  Today CDs are dirt cheap. I’ve doubled mine in the last few years. Most were a buck or less. But, admittedly, I like thrifting and most people do not. But even new CDs are pretty cheap. I bought a double CD of Hank Williams recently on Amazon, brand new for like 8 Dollars.  Plus, I still use cassettes.  I enjoy biking and I use a walkman for listening to music while biking. I can operate it completely blind and through my pockets.  I only have to pull over to change the tape.  I could probably do the same thing with the phone, but it’s my habit. It’s fun, if time consuming to create an analog playlist by creating a mix tape.

Thank you for sharing your experience.
If I had pursued similar strategies, I could have saved enough money to take at least one round trip flight on the Concorde or attended the 2002 Winter Olympics.
Maybe in the next lifetime.

                I wholeheartedly agree. I never have and never will purchase an item in digital incarnation. If the Evil Ones decide your digital item contains wrongthink, they will make it disappear. The only way they can eliminate my books, CD, and DVDs, which I have in considerable abundance, is at gunpoint. Then too, as you say, there’s something a little extra about being able to hold a thing in your hands. Digital objects have no soul.As for small appliances, I purchase them at antique stores. The last thing I need is Mr. Sha’Quand’rius Coffee making sure I don’t drop an N-bomb while I’m eating breakfast.

                I’ve been bad about this as CDs have better audio quality than all but a handful of rarely used digital codecs (due to file size) and the commercial pressing means that they’ll never go bad, whereas digital audio stored on hard drives is subject to “bit rot”

                    As far as storing digital audio goes, I think the best strategy is shifting to a newer, larger drive every few years or so, or when the drive health monitoring begins to throw warnings about the condition of the drive. You could also set up some kind of RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) for additional data protection.

                Agree with most of your comments. I think (“hope”!) your fear of renegade appliances connecting to the net of their own accord may be a bit overblown. Yes, theoretically they can connect to the web but they need an open (unsecured) access point. In my experience those are pretty infrequent nowadays. Most users are idiots so the default is a secure router. It’s unlikely your new “smart” appliance will be able to connect to anything until you specifically tell it what and with what password.Note that the issue of surveillance is still highly relevant. If a pro is going to spy on you there is probably little the average schmuck could do to defend himself. An ongoing issue is the LEGAL snooping that is done or at least possible. Just for openers: If you have any kind of mobile phone, even the non-smart flip phone, the phone network knows your location within a few meters. This information is logged and routinely sold to interested parties. If you have a smart phone, all your calls, texts, etc. are logged. Some privacy protections exist, but mostly just in theory. Have an Alexa? Well you have a de-facto audio bug in that room. Etc.Although I have geek roots, in my 20+ years of retirement the geek only comes out when needed (e.g. have to set up a new PC). My $6000* (used) pair of “ultimate” speakers is still connected to the amp with alligator leads and electrical tape. It’s been nearly a year. Oh yes, pardon the tangent.Just over a year ago, when I started a diet, I bought a digital scale. It works well enough, but I had to download a smart phone app and connect via Bluetooth to the scale (and the connect feature didn’t even work!) — before I could even use the scale at all as a standalone. Yes you read that correctly: Imagine buying what you thought was a bathroom scale and after you got home you found out you had to have a mobile phone etc. before you could even weigh yourself. What about the folks that don’t have a phone?*That could have been a reply to the earlier comments about audiophile foolery. I’ve dabbled in that pond, at the low end. I’m not nearly as active on the boards as I used to be. But yes, audio is but one example of a pastime where some people seemingly spend as much as they can just for bragging rights. And niche manufacturers will respond to the demand to sell $1000 cables, $10,000 preamps, or whatever. A major point: some of the stuff really has merit. My expensive speakers are intended for PA use like in a church, small performance venues, etc. But it turns out that they do stuff that is difficult to impossible for “normal” speakers to do. Granted, not everyone wants a pair of speakers in their living room that weight 130 Lb. (each). Nearly all speakers must make various compromises that necessarily distort the sound. Brand X found a way around a lot of the limitations. Unfortunately, there are physical constraints and that requires a large heavy box. Technically, you could do almost as well with a much smaller speaker, but it would only work if your listening area were something approaching an anechoic chamber.I’ve had a lot of speakers in my life, and the only pair that ever came close was an earlier iteration of the design. Long story short: sometimes you get what you pay for.For the curious, here’s an old bookmark, an excellent depiction of the audio-fool:https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/geddes-on-waveguides.103872/post-1377671

            I don’t know if it’s changed but last time I tried to figure out why they don’t pay me for selling my work, the way Spotify royalty distribution was calculated, every listen to a famous song takes money away from an unknown musician—statistically. To avoid sending out a million checks (or whatever) to people like me, they calculate everyone’s percentage of “listens,” assign zero to all of them that are anywhere near zero—which is almost all of them—then they give Taylor Swift all of our money.

            I always point to this as there will never be another Beatles. Regardless of whether you liked or lumped The Beatles, you knew them and their songs – the Ed Sullivan performance, everyone tuned in to watch this thing.Now, there are too many streams of entertainment for each to dive into, exclusive of all the others. Couple this with increased isolation from parents, the ability to consume as an individual versus living room (e.g. cell phones instead of one tv in livingroom; ear buds instead of one record player), and a father and son can live in two different eras or streams of entertainment without ever splashing the other.I learned to appreciate prog rock and 60s groups because my parents listened to them, and I was forced to hear it; they heard my music (90s alt rock). In the digital era, we live right along one another while completely isolated.And, yes, I love my physical media. I treasure my cds, but my most prized are my vinyls. I love the mono sound of a good 60s cut over the cd remasters with their faked stereo or simply digital, empty sound. The space of the white noise that vinyl offers cannot be well recreated. Digital does well, however, for albums like Aja, The audiophile album, though I still prefer the vinyl’s suppleness.I do, however, have Spotify premium. Simply, though it does kill the romance, the ability while driving to put, hand-free through voice commands, a track or album on is awesome. I definitely get my 10 bucks a month worth out of the program. Though, in a perfect world, I would smash ever smartphone and smart appliance, I cannot resist the siren call of convenience for music.See, now I am thinking of Tim Buckley. And on my way home, I can put him on! “Hey Google, play ‘Song of the Siren…”

                My own father strongly shaped my taste in music by forcing me to listen to his music in his car and even sometimes the living room TV.  A lot of the stuff I didn’t really like, especially in the 80s are now some of my most listened to songs today.  A lot of the stuff I liked back then is noise or at least so overplayed that I can’t stand listening to it.If I had put on a pair of headphones in the car, I think I would have been beaten for my troubles.  The isolation of people today, even in close proximity is just weird.  Sailfoams have been a huge double edged sword for society.  I’m just not sure the price has been worth it.  Every single aspect of sailfoams have had a huge cost we pay.  Kids cannot remember phone numbers. Nobody can read a map or even plan a route beforehand when going somewhere unfamiliar.  So many people cannot do basic arithmetic in their heads. Privacy is a complete thing of the past.  Granted, there have been a lot of upsides.  But on the whole, I am really unsure that the price we have paid and will continue to pay is worth it.  If the sailfoam revolution had never happened, we’d still have access to the world through computers.  But what we couldn’t do was go out as a family to a restaurant and have everyone with their face in the sailfoam. You wouldn’t have to listen to the incessant chatter of people on their sailfoams everywhere you go.  I can’t even get gas in peace. Who knows what gen-Z will be like in due time. They’ve never known anything but the world of sailfoams. Many of them are so poorly socialized that they message each other in their physical presence.

            Taylor Swift is like the Trump of pop music: a shadow of much, much better acts in the past, but, it’s all we got right now.
While I don’t mind hearing some of her tunes I didn’t think of it until Z mentioned it that most (all?) of her stuff is just a step up from Muzak where all the sharp, pointy sounds are gone in favor of a string of empty, inoffensive chords.  The B-side dreck from any 80s movie soundtrack has more punch and that stuff was punched out by a machine press.

        Re: Hysteria … and more particularly female-hysteria and its impact:Happened across an article in Spiked, linked to on Powerline (my Normie / ConInc check site), titled Social Manias Die Quietly.  Author of the piece is this Brendan O’Neil; the posting outlines his conversation with some author named Lionel Shriver.  Subject is the writer’s latest novel: Mania.The basic story is about a fictional Mental Parity Movement, and its impact on two individuals who were formerly friends.  In this piece, they discussed at length the recent mass manias (COVID, Climate, Systemic Racism, Trans), in a very unfavorable light.  Additionally ,they spend time on the fact that they are elite driven, and that no one is ever held accountable after they die down.I followed along approvingly through the discussion, knowing nothing about the writer.  Turns out, this “Lionel is a female in her middle 60s, American by birth, who previously lived in Britain, and now lives in Portugal.  OK …Might still be OK, I thought.  The article linked to the actual interview, so I want there to hear more.I agreed with a lot of what was said.  His last question, however, threw her into a verbal tailspin.  He asked her who she would vote for in the upcoming Presidential election.  the verbal gymnastics were quite impressive.She could not answer clearly:  In the end, she said Biden was too weak, but Trump is too dangerous.  She did ultimately say she’d have to vote for Biden, but then but then seemed to back away from that, too.Anyway — creative elite, female, democrat.  Here the was talking and writing about “mania” when she herself then at the end her own madness comes roaring out.Modern Maenads ….Seemed to me the smell of elitist disdain and revulsion for Trump lay heavy in the air.  Turns out also our girl Lionel was a tomboy when young, and changed her name to something more fitting with her … experience.  Are they all, well …. different?Looked her up on Wikipedia — Democrat — of course …. not that I any longer am surprised by irrational belief and behavior on the part of Republicans.  The Ds just excel at madness.

            “He asked her who she would vote for in the upcoming Presidential election. the verbal gymnastics were quite impressive.”I’ve got this leftie wine aunt who was bragging to me about how “open-minded” she is, using as evidence the fact that she, a lifelong Democrat, voted for a Republican, Nikki Haley, in the primaries.So I ask her, “So you’re saying that if Nikki Haley was running against Biden in the presidential election, you’d vote for Haley over Biden?”Her response: Long silence, stammering, and finally an unconvincing “Um, maybe.”Of course, it was utter B.S. She only crossed the aisle to vote against Trump and screw her local Republicans. Even so, she was convinced that she was a helluva gal.These people…there’s no reasoning with them. They’re not just trying to fool us. They’re trying to fool themselves.

                Why wouldn’t she vote for Nikki Tikki Tavi? Ideologically, there’s no more than a hair’s difference between the she and Biden, and Nikki has a vajayjay, which automatically makes her the superior person.

            I can’t understand how anyone looks around and thinks Trump is too dangerous, especially since Trump’s version of MAGA has a lot to do with keeping the game going. If he is dangerous, that’s why. Get it over with, or pay a steeper price down the road.
Lefty has good instincts and a bad mind. She doesn’t know what she’s saying. Righty checks his logic and waits for orders, so he gets led around by the balls.

            I’ve learned to stop reading after “the author is an American living in…” You know the person is a shitlib after those words. The only things that will be different are superficial. If it’s Australia, the SL is probably from the South and wants warm weather. If it’s Britain or “the continent”, SL places a high value on Euro-pretention. Only Eastern Europe or Russia places their politics in any doubt and if that’s where they are, they are probably a CIA asset gathering intel on “the enemy” under cover of being an author or journalist.

        AFAIK, the whole TikTok thing is about information made available to the CCP through permissions rather than the content.  Though honestly, from what I can tell not being a regular tiktok user, the content is also garbage and much of it is subversive.While the US can use warrants to get user data from US corporations, the CCP doesn’t need them. All Chinese corporations are subject to the CCP in this sense. They must, under Chinese law share whatever the CCP asks for. TikTok wants access to everything on your phone.But of course the clowns wrote a very generic bill allowing them to shut down or force the sale of any company the executive branch wants to shut down.

            A few years ago, ByteDance (owner of TikTok) agreed to have Oracle handle US TikTok data, so it is already in the spooks’ hands if they want it. That said, true, most of the content is garbage and a lot of it is subversive, yes, but that is true of every social media site. No, the TikTok thing is because their algorithm does not have the censorship built into it that American social media sites do. Hence, the topics that people actually want to talk about rise to the top in the algorithm. Now, what would people want to talk about today? Well, these days a lot of people want to talk about Israel and the fact that they are dropping American-made bombs on women and children, and opening fire on starving people looking to get food. That will not do.This isn’t even conjecture, one of if not the first organization to come out in favor of the TikTok ban was the Jewish Federation of North America (which is an umbrella Jewish organization of other Jewish organizations) and they specifically cited an increase in “antisemitism” on the platform. Greenblatt has also talked about how “they” have a major perception problem with younger people, and TikTok is the social media app for younger people. This is the reason why. Make no mistake about it.

            Granted we live under a regime hell-bent on world domination. I have a general technical, if not business and legal background. Please explain to me precisely how the government can force the sale of, or shut down, a corporation or other entity with no U.S. presence? Note: I’m aware they can do a lot of damage, e.g. prohibit the app from being in the store or whatever. Biggest power is likely economic: viz ban credit card processing for disfavored firms.

        In the end, the truth will prevail, because it is the truth. Derbyshire got put out to pasture for saying the truth. The NRO has written maybe millions of words since 2012, but all have been forgotten. Even the people who fired him knows what he said was true, which tells you the power of ideology, and the power of wanting to remain in polite company, whatever that may be. Yet, the truth will still trudge on.I’m going to go ahead and say the same thing is going to happen with the conservacuck cause of the moment. They are currently tying themselves into knots to say that, actually, police action and draconian free speech laws are a good thing as long as the targets are opponents of Israel. They are saying that, actually, shutting down protests because peoples’ feelings are hurt is a good thing, as long as those people are Jewish. People on both the right and left can see how ridiculous this is, and the truth will prevail on this too.

            I wonder if FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression) has weighed in on behalf of the campus protesters. That organization, which was established by (((Alan Charles Kors))) and (((Harvey Silverglate))), has done yeoman work in striking down unconstitutional campus speech codes. All this pro-Pali/anti-Israel hullabaloo, however, will really put their committment to free speech to the test.

            I still listen to my local conservacuck radio station but with no real interest or enthusiasm. Their views are completely predictable. They talked about the student protests and framed them exactly as Limbaugh would have in about ’92. Just another bunch of pinko students beings pinkos and hating ‘Murricka and The Chosen People, antisemitism, etc… The only time they critique the GOP is when they cuck on the 2nd Amendment. I’m glad they call them out on this but it’s the only indication that these guys are not living in some parallel universe where it’s forever 1991, Desert Storm just ended, GHWB is still at 80+ in the polls and the only challenge is that sleazy sax player from Arkansas. Their views on Russia, Ukraine, etc… are likewise predictable. It almost makes me want to tune in the local Lefty station that runs “Democracy Now!”.

            I wonder that too. Human history is a catalogue of great civilizations collapsing into dark ages. Each iteration of great civilizations better than the last. Sumeria bested by Egypt. Egypt bested by Greece. Greece bested by Rome. If the Roman Empire had a few more Marcus Aurelii, we may have had the industrial revolution in the fourth century.Personally I think we were on the cusp of a Star Trek future in the late 1960s, then our own great American civilization began degrading. Will we pull out of our decline, and have a few more good decades, like what happened in the Roman second century? Or will we slowly then suddenly disintegrate like the Austro-Hungarians?

            The tech issues ARE insurmountable.  the currently understood laws of physics show travel at greater than the speed of light is not possible. Even if it were possible , the ammount of energy it would take to reach AND stop from that speed is more Enormous.The nearest planet that is within the very narrow band of distance from a sun that would allow liquid water to exist is over 4 light years away. The fastest speed we achieved in space was 25000mph  on the way back from the moon with apollo 11 . that is .004 % of the speed of light . If we could get a nw type of ship up to 10 times that fast, it would still take over 100 years to reach that planet.   So mo, ET ain’t real.  .

                    My view about the UFO craze(s) is simply that, regardless of whether the phenomena are of alien origin or not, they obviously do NOT represent any real attempt to contact us in an open and honest fashion. Anyone capable of building the machines people see (assuming they are real machines) would also be able to land and call a press conference.This doesn’t really rule out that there might be alien equivalents of pedophiles who get some sexual thrill out of probing hillbillies to death. What would such a perversion be called? xenophillia? Well, in any case, they obviously want to avoid being put on the Galactic Sex Offenders Registry.I’m being a bit silly but the point is that the UFO phenomenon, whatever it is, is not really *about* us, except perhaps as subjects of research or amusement.

                        This presumption that humans know everything there is to know about physics is staggering. There’s pretty well never been a time in human history when it wasn’t wrong.

                I mostly agree, but:it would still take over 100 years to reach that planet.If people lived 1000 years (something ridiculous, but more easily surmountable than most space flight issues) this might no seem that big a deal, I don’t know.Whenever this is discussed to the two far fetched (but not completely unreasonable) ideas I bring up are “wormholes” (separating a point in space into more than one physical location) and “inertial dampers/gravity wave manipulation”.  The primary issue with both is obviously that they’re probably not possible, but the secondary issue is that even the process of developing the tech might lead to a planet destroying accident (to say nothing of the weapon a final product would make).

                Flying off to Alpha Centauri isn’t possible right now.  Getting around the solar system and making activities like asteroid mining – we are very close.  Once out there, needs and opportunity would drive further development.
There is plenty of hard sci-fi scenarios for getting to another system without warp drive.  Just a big enough ship going fast enough to for relativity to shorten the time.

            I saw the more snarky version of this theory in Gab a few days ago. Every civilization in every planet have their “chosen” and their “special needs” populations that bring technological civilizations down.
This solves the Fermi paradox. Poor Fermi was too smart to understand the stupidity of the average human and did not live (lucky guy) long enough to see our Marxist-Capitalist American Paradise.

            I don’t know. To me given our financial problems and all of the other problems we face here in our neighborhoods and towns much less our countries this sounds to me like more white cowardice and cope. We’ve been running from our ethnic/racial problems ever since Lincoln attended his last theater event.When can humans reliably inhabit space and manage its vast distances while still being human?Why don’t we man up and focus our resources on confronting our problems as a distinct American ethnos before the odds get ever more insurmountable.Space is great and fine. It is probably the domain of robots and AI applied to mechanical things. Space is in our future but not as an escape hatch. All manned missions in space are utterly dependent upon who controls the land and water and other resources back at home. Let’s unf*** ourselves from our dispossession at home and secure our future here before we go out into space as our primary objective.

        Not having listened the show yet, the claims about the first flying car and a historic flight with a 70 something is complete and utter nonsense.  The Aerocar was developed in the 1940s. I don’t think it was commercially sold, but it was built and there is footage of it taking off, flying and landing. It was also a roadworthy car.  There was also an amphibious car. There are many of these still “on the road”The problem with flying or floating cars is they are never any good at either being a car or a plane/boat. Too many sacrifices have to be made to get both functionality.

        As far as legal software to resolve lawsuits, some years back this started to take hold in contract disputes. If both parties consent, stipulate to the facts, and there is no issue of witness credibility, the software determines the outcome. Think of an arbitration agreement and digitalize it. I don’t know if witness credibility or perhaps factual determinations ever can or will be determined via software, but it is possible at least in theory, particularly for the latter.As far as Derbyshire, it is hard to believe even the corrupt, cowardly pussies at National Review fired him over The Talk back then. Regardless, that column would be mainstream now, barely edgy, and promoted by cuckservatives such as Michael Walsh or Charlie Kirk. It will not change the trajectory but the conversation has shifted dramatically despite massive censorship and deplatforming.

            Consumer arbitration should be outlawed.  Contracts of adhesion should be outlawed.  Giving up any constitutionally protected right by default, like access to the courts and free speech should be outlawed.  If we file a lawsuit against a company and they approach us and ask us if we want to go arbitration instead, OK,  I can agree with that.  But products wrapped in plastic bags saying by opening the bag you agree to arbitration, this should be outlawed.  EULA that force arbitration should be outlawed. If that raises the cost so high the business is not viable, then it isn’t viable. If fraud is what makes your business viable, it’s a fraud, not a business.We pay for the courts. We pay outrageously for the courts. Unlike the feds, where there is a lot of printed and borrowed money funding everything, states cannot print money and we are paying. Now some soulless corp trying to rob or silence us can get away with preventing us from suing them in a neutral court?The software criminal justice model to me sounds like one of the worst police states imaginable.

                The parties to the contract disputes agree to use of the software to save money and there are major differences between arbitration and use of software to resolve those conflicts. Arbitration was kind of an awkward analogy on my part. Arbitration agreements are made prior to contract formation, and use of software to resolve any conflict is made afterwards as long as the facts are and can be stipulated.Again, witness credibility does not lend itself to software resolution, and factual conflict probably does not. I cannot imagine criminal defense attorneys would submit anyhow since they rely so much on emotional appeal as it is. The same applies to contract disputes and other business litigation when the facts can be interpreted differently and cannot be stipulated.

                    I wasn’t really disagreeing with you on that point.  Business to business contracts are nowhere near as one sided and predatory as business to consumer contracts of adhesion like found in EULA for software and products in bags demanding arbitration.In my mind, is an outrage that a company can force you into their arbitration system which they picked and they pay for.  It is almost as bad as forcing you into a arbitration with an arbitrator owned by the parent company.  If a judge owns a stock of the company you are suing, they have to recuse themselves.  They are forcing you into a situation where the “court” is not neutral and has a large financial connection to the company.I don’t think a voluntary system of software criminal justice is viable. Almost nobody would agree to it.

                        The main issue with banning contracts of adhesion is that virtually no one who is renting a 1 BR apartment has the chops to even understand enough of the law to write anything better for his state laws, nor the finances to be able to hire someone who does.The “take it or leave it” nature of adhesion contracts is bad for those who can afford their own attorneys, but a godsend for those who cannot. The problems with C/A would be better addressed by those with the skills writing better boilerplate rather than banning them and letting the chips fall where they may.But no matter how many well-meaning people work to improve C/A, if enough people just sign the old ones, nothing changes.

        I don’t really need intellectual specificity here. Dissident right, alt-right, whatever you want to call it, it’s all kind of the same to me. Basically, it’s poking your finger in the eyes of the establishment and all of their warped priorities. However, alt-right is a term that became toxic with normies because it was conflated with being a skinhead by the very same people who infiltrated and killed the TEA Party.

        Never heard of Jean-Michel Jarre, but I’m very familiar with the music of his father, Maurice Jarre.  He wrote many film scores for famous movies, such as ‘Lawrence of Arabia’, and ‘Doctor Zhivago’.

                Casting couch pioneer Louis B. Mayer had that nickname back when the Eagles were kids. They knew Robert Evans, so the song has always been assumed to be about him.
Don Henley had a similar reputation in the music business. Unlike his Hollywood counterparts, he never got anybody a job. (His career is weirdly sparse. Whatever he’s into, it’s not music.)

            His life story could serve as the basis for a modern remake ofJud Süß. But yeah, #MeToo really does mark the end of the legal system as we know it by potentially criminalizing sex. The Trump trials could be the coup de grâce for White participation in politics. If Weinstein does get a reprieve (he’s still looking at a lengthy prison sentence in California), it’ll likely be for his Jewishness.

        The Defenestration of Derb put to rest the idea that National Review and Conservative Inc had any spine in it left whatsoever.  It was a watershed moment for many realizing that the “conservative” movement would cave in and banish its long term members whenever the left demanded it.
John Derbyshire may as well be the Patron Saint of Lost Causes for those who fancy themselves on the “right” (whatever that is).  I’ve very much enjoyed both his writing and his podcasts over the decades.

            First him, then Mark Steyn.  And as our Zman referred to the Mann vs Steyn climate change trial, that one too was decided on the basis of punishing the badthinker.  It took 12 years to come to trial, and yet the prosecutor summed up his case by appealing to the jury with inflammatory references to Trump, MAGA and January 6.

        Just to note that there is a bunch of software out there (trying) to do A/P automation and it typically involves some integration with an ERP system’s purchase order data.  True, the pitch I saw just pushed the voucher into the system (so someone still had to hit the “go” button to pay the invoice) but it’s doubtful anyone will, over time, carefully analyze the list of payments in the system.  It may even end up being more reliable than some human A/P departments whose only threshold for payment is “has it been paid before”.

            These trailblazers need to do a little bit of reorganization where the intellectual property rights are owned by one entity, and the operating entity is separate. That’s how the Catholic Church does things where the bishop owns all of the real estate in trust, and the pedo priests are in the employ of the local parish or diocese, which is separate from the real estate.
Z-man might even consider that kind of setup.

        Derb got me into the dissident sphere. At the time (2015 or so) I was looking for interesting podcasts and I remembered an article Gawker wrote about him and his famous “The Talk: Nonblack Version” essay. You can imagine that Gawker was not kind to him, and even I was beginning to notice, Sailer-like, that new media sites like Deadspin and Buzzfeed and HuffPo were abandoning the snarky skepticism (i.e. the tone that Jon Stewart set) in favor of smug progressive evangelizing, with an emphasis on worshipping the female and the nonwhite.By now we were deep into a cavalcade of black-on-police incidents, apparent racial slurs being shouted from pickup trucks, and poop swastikas found on walls. BLM was getting going and me, still pretty much center-left (by the standards of the time) was wondering: what’s up with all the racisms? I am white, and had hung out with whites in intimate settings all my life, but I never heard any racisms myself, beyond grumblings about blacks “being loud” and stealing stuff. And I grew up in Lagos-on-the-Mississippi. So I figured I’d check out this Derb fellow, which Gawker helpfully pointed me to.And Derb had a podcast on Apple Podcasts! I listened to it. It was certainly different…it was learned and captivating, but I was worried I was listening to some Stormfront-adjacent podcaster. I rememberApt Pupil. Though after a few listens the fear subsided, and this was just some English bloke saying what most white people think, if they get their head out of their ass. I was hooked for many years, and looked forward to listening on Saturdays. His admiration of Trump was a bit hard for me to understand, as I didn’t fully cross over to this side of the great divide until round 2018, but I appreciated hearing the other side.I haven’t listened to Derb much recently. His pods are too gloomy. I have heard about everything I need to hear about immigration and its effects. And I was never a VDare guy. “The world is going to shit”-themed Conservative media (“conservative pessimism” as Derb champions) which has been dominant for a long time, has grown tiresome to me. I like the jolly, snarky, irreverent and young voices bubbling up on Substack and Twitter. This youthful tone is what started the Left on its 25-year run of media dominance, and I have a feeling that if we are going to RETVRN, it’s going to start with young white guys making cookie jokes.

            I agree. I think the format of pure pointing out the problems will not sustain us. It is too bleak, and it is going to get a lot worse – way worse. We are only just beginning.I think a format that is snark is not proper either. I think the best format is a combination of problem, solution and pure vision with a listing of who and where said vision is being put into practice. We need to understand the problems to stoke the justifiable and necessary outrage. We need to discuss solutions, things that we can do and should build toward that are a part of a vision. That must then be combined with in-person networks that are local that in turn connect to more distant networks of doers.In the dark of winter’s night, we gather wood, build and tend the fire and gather together around it. We identify issues, we identify solutions and those among us proving capable by solving them and we support one another and celebrate moving forward and coming together.This is extremely difficult because since the bayonets came out in the 50s the government has abandoned us. This is a terrible, terrible situation. We must see the flip side that this is the opportunity for us to foster us taking our own side and actively nurturing it from within and defend it as we create our shield wall. Great post Marko.The road to glory begins when the sack of rocks called despair is abandoned on the side of the road. It only saps our strength.God bless you all and have a great weekend. Thank you ZMan for carrying the flame. Btw, one thing that you did that was very valuable to me was your Essential Knowledge section. It was a compass and is proving to be very edifying. Have a great weekend with some laughs some deep experiences with a friend, know you are not alone and embrace and relish the hero’s journey that we are on.

                The unedited raw footage of black ferals beating and harming white children has done infinitely more to radicalize people than any treatise or snark ever could. I freely admit Musk’s acquisition of then-Twitter was a far more significant even than I gave it credit, in no small part due to such things as the availability of that footage and the exposure of the lies about the pro-Palestinian protests being somehow violent (not that I care for any of those involved).

Well, he did write a book titled “We Are All Doomed”. Lol, I haven’t listened for a couple years either cuz of the same reason. Plus, he’s got that bug all the ancients get, pining for and wanting to exist in the past, usually their prime years they’re most fond. I do the same thing (nearly same age as Derb). He’s good people though, him and his wife both.

            I remembered an article Gawker wrote about him—I remember that as it was amusing that National Review pushed him out and the first place he turned up at weeks later was that Gawker article.  Somewhere, probably a Sailer comment thread, wondered why he would show up there first of all places with some people noting that you don’t go trying to convert people already in the church.  To their credit, in your case, it looks like it worked…mostly 😉

            Great comment but for the record Snark, capitalized or not, is a fail. Snark reflects a whole way of being that is lefty. Irony in all it forms including snark, it may have its occasional place here or there, but not now. It’s vaguely womanly, tbf. I know that ol’ Nickerpants (Fuentes) uses A LOT of snark, and that’s part of the reason that serious men won’t take him seriously. Conversely, he obv has his fans.

                I think there are “solutions” but the majority of our side seem utterly committed to not doing.Either @Lineman or @LineInTheSand keeps suggesting “Tribe up”, which is OK, but it requires that one forego lost causes. You will never bring the various metro areas around. Any time at all you devote to that is completely squandered. What you can do is bring both that fervor and your expertise and assets to some more remote location, and then, the most important bit, share that knowledge and help out some fellow tribesman. Be the man that everyone screams that boomers are not.It’s utterly inexcusable that anyone with a teenage son calls a plumber to fix a Delta washerless faucet. If you don’t have that information, Youtube does.

                During the podcast this week I heard Z say that this site gets 300,000 unique visitors a month. There are bound to be some people in a group that size who don’t have very good manners. It’s a good sign in an odd way. Hopefully the MLM scammers won’t be the next group to invade. It’s sort of like the border, gotta stop the “chain migration”.

        HOWLER: “The law itself is fine.”. (19:01)Oh, man, that’s a belly buster. You, Vinnyvette, and a few other connivers ought to establish a bar association for “dissident right” Ameritards. Buy some old Masonic lodge, and turn it into an inn of court. You could develop a goofy ceremony for initiations. Have elaborate regular meetings with fancy costumes.Make it for male only, like a college frat, just to make sure no yenta or AWFL backstabber sneaks in. Have a probationary period for new members. They’d be like pledges, and you could haze them to separate the sissyish conformist from the serious whitetard.To encourage visitation by your membership, of whom Vinnyvette is clearly one, mandate performance of the Ballamy salute inside the inn by every member at least once every four years. They’ll get the message and recite the pledge of allegiance to your corporatist flag without having to be told. (Will ANY of them will suss out the contradition in the final phrase??) A minyan of thirteen saluters would make sense here. Because slavishly honoring knavish ancestors and retarded forebears is the habit of “a man”, as you define one.https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=31922#comment-402051
