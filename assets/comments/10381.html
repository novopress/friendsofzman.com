        The idea that science crawled out was against the “darkness” of Catholic Church in particular is a romantic daydream of the last 20th century and into the 21st. Science takes educated men, time, and financial support. The Catholic Church consistently offered all of these through it’s Priests, Monks, and the university system. I can link to a list of the early scientists and almost all of them are Monks/Priests for all the reasons I just mentioned.It is borderline insane to imagine that in the late middle ages European society was actively against science, particularly the Church. Islam, in the 12th century, actively turned against science and it’s stayed that way ever since. What are their achievements since then? Science requires the active support of greater society and it’s learned classes.Within the Catholic Church it is heresy to say reason is against faith. Indeed, the Church gave the time, money, and support precisely because it believed that to study Creation was to study God. Galileo was no “simple” science hero of science. He put his foot square into a political mess and wouldn’t back down, pushing another man’s work in science (Copernicus), who understood the issues of the day and was willing to let the information come out slowly.And frankly neither the church nor science crumbled in it’s Galileo moment. The Church crumbling would happen hundreds of years after that moment and science certainly marched on.Unfortunately, science is also crumbling right now. Quality has plummeted except in the very hardest of sciences and even then it’s questionable. The wish to ignore racial data is part of lowering of quality.I believe that the decline of sciences in one of the results of abandoning Christianity and replacing it with science worship, as you have done here. Scientism is part of why much of the alt-white is indistinguishable from it’s liberal counterparts.  You can’t fight one particular line of science worship with another particular line of science worship. It’s just two groups with the same point of view picking out what they like best from it.If people are serious about wanting Western Civilization back, they’re going to have to stop telling themselves lies about science, Christianity, and their relative compatibility. Science is in fact, the daughter of Christianity and to abandon the later is to abandon the former.

            Excellent comment. It’s not so much the case that the Church “gave ground to science” as that it lost the battle against a corrosive and reductionist rationalism that offered man the false promise of “do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law”. Catholic Christianity has never opposed honest inquiry into the workings of creation, and it’s long past time to do away with the scientistic myth of the Holy Martyr Galileo.

            the issue with the catholic church and science, is the same as we see today.  science is subservient to political power.  and like any master, the church wanted some things investigated, and some things not.  the one case that everyone knows about is with galileo, because of course his work on astronomy threatened the church’s ideological basis for ruling; “that’s not heaven up there, just some other stars”

                Nope, Galileo threatened nothing of the sort. His problems were manifold:– He was wrong about a whole bunch of things, such as the tides and his insistence on a pure Copernican circular-orbit model for the solar system, and other scientists (including Jesuit astronomers) pointed out that Galileo’s theories were often inconsistent with agreed-upon observations.– He compounded this wrongness by launching vituperative crusades against anyone who disagreed with him or questioned his findings, no matter how measured or empirically sound their arguments were.– He claimed the right to pronounce authoritatively on matters Scriptural.– He put the icing on the cake of bad judgement by writing a dialogue on astronomy and making one character (whom he named Simplicio, geddit?) a stand-in for the pope, who had up to this point been his friend and patron.At the time, the Church was embroiled in the political and religious disorder sparked by the Reformation, so she wasn’t inclined to indulge the tantrums and deliberate provocations of a brilliant but somewhat unhinged scientist.Given all this, Galileo was treated remarkably gently, suffering only the penalty of living under house arrest in (horrors!) his Tuscany estate during his final years.If you’re looking for an entertaining but scientifically accurate account of the Galileo Affair, the author Mike Flynn wrote a fantastic series called The Great Ptolemaic Smackdown, which goes over the whole thing in great depth:http://tofspot.blogspot.ca/2013/08/the-great-ptolemaic-smackdown.html

                    Excellent summation. Socrates described himself as a gadfly, — the horsefly that stings the intellectually and morally sluggish with his questioning. Galileo too was a gadfly, but it didn’t get him killed, did it? He enjoyed tweaking the sluggish as a sport, and he knew exactly what he was doing. Galileo’s confession was a masterpiece of tweak.

            PiffleRMe, I think that there are at least three ways to begin handling your interesting claim that Science is the daughter of Christianity.First of all, to which sect of Christianity did Eratosthenes belong? As you know, he died about 190 yrs before the alleged birth of Jesus, so it stands to reason that Christianity was flourishing in secret in Athens, say, 300 yrs before the birth of Jesus. This would have given Christianity sufficient time to influence Eratosthenes’ own teachers, or other Christian influences during their formative years, so that they could nudge Eratosthenes toward science when he arrived in Athens. And maybe Christianity was influential also in Cyrene, where he was born.Second, we could date the birth of science to about 1453, after which year some Byzantine scholars sought refuge in the west and brought their learning and some texts with them. So, why did the gestation of Science last more than 1400 yrs?? That’s an extremely long pregnancy for a mother whose genes predispose her offspring to a rigorous investigation of nature.https://www.britannica.com/biography/EratosthenesThird, if we were to suspect that Christianity would have children and  grandchildren, there is good reason to suspect that they would turn out much more like Muhammadism than Science.http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm/frm/160197/sec_id/160197

                *sigh* The existence of science work outside or before the Christianity does not make my statement incorrect. A systematic study of science requires, well, a system that supports it. The only places science has ever received that widespread, millenia long support, outside of war development, are in Christian societies. It’s fun and easy to diss Christianity because you found some people throughout history doing similar work.  It’s also extremely ignorant of how much knowledge Christianity has gathered in the last 1000 years on this world.And as for the last remark, you are vaguely correct in so much that Muhammadism is Christian heresy, but then again so is Mormonism. I’m happy to talk about all of history honestly, but I refuse to play these games where Christianity never did anything right or well, especially as we communicate on an the end product of it.

        This whole human evolution story contains a lot of total bullshit; just made up crap to stroke the egos of researchers.Not that evolution is a myth; it is not. After all, humans and chimps/apes (whatever) share about 95% – 98% of DNA. So, somewhere, way way back there had to be a common ancestor(s).What is bullshit is the notion that scientists “know” where humans originated. No they do not and they never have; and they really never will.If you took all the bones ever found of pre-humans, they would fit on a large conference room table. So, what these scientists have done is say, ‘well, since the oldest bones so far discovered have been in Africa (or, more recently, Greece or Siberia -e,g., Denisovans – or wherever), therefore this region is where humans originated.Of course, that hypothesis is fine until they find even older bones of more RECENT humans , say in Uzbekistan or under a hundred feet of ice in Greenland, or maybe deep in some canyon in N.America, or Australia or Laos.Then what?The fact is finding pre-human bones is pure, dumb luck; and finding just one set of bones that does not fit existing dogma tosses out ( or should toss out) the entire concocted  “expert” explanation of where human life originated.Think about this; during the Ice Ages, sea levels were 300 feet to 400 feet LOWER than today and surely, many groups of pre-humans or near-humans lived in areas now under 300 feet of water. Any bones there will never be found. Bones there could be significantly older and more human like than any so far discovered.It is just human tendency to seek an explanation for something; nothing wrong with that. But developing a thesis based upon an incredible paucity of evidence (e.g., a few bones found at Olduvai Gorge ) is just plain wrong and misleading.

        There is still very little evidence in the fossil record to support evolution, i.e., the transformation of one species into another, as opposed to adaptation, i.e., biological variation within a species. Ultimately, those who believe in the Science! of evolution are engaged in an act of faith similar to that of a religious person.

            this my main beef with Darwin, he didn’t really discover or explain anything.  how life started?  nope.  how a new species arises?  nope.   any farmer can tell you how to push breeding pairs in any direction you want them to go.
they used to think different species couldn’t interbreed, but then we get a few Ligers and poof!   I have read that even mules are occasionally able to reproduce.
maybe some curious chinese scientist can do some experiments on mixing human and chimp zygotes (think IVF) to produce a viable embryo.

                You are right – Darwin did a good job describing how we got fast race horses, juicy apples, etc…  Little “e” evolution.
But we’ve yet to learn how big “E” evolution really works – where you end up with a whole new species.  Often with a different # of chromosomes and completely unable to breed with the old species.  What the hell happened to create it?

                Sure – African humans adapted to their climate with dark skin and generally longer, leaner bodies.  Humans in northern Europe and Asia developed lighter skin because of the lower exposure sunlight, and thicker more compact bodies to deal with the cold.  But they can still breed with each other.
We supposedly share a common ancestor with all primates.  Humans have 46 chromosomes, gorillas have 48, Rhesus monkeys have 42, Capuchin monkey have 54.  How did this happen?  The “drift” answer is pretty weak and has no proof at all.

                The issue I have with your position is that the line between adaptation within a species and evolution from one species to another (i.e., speciation) is drawn arbitrarily.
Here’s a link to the sequence of Eohippus to Equus including pictures of skeletons. I could just as arbitrarily characterize this as adaptation within a single species, rather then evolution.

                    I think one of the definitions of species is inability to produce fertile offspring – up until that point you’re talking race or breed.Biology has fuzzy borders no doubt, but Teosinte and  Maizeare different species. Mutation is a real phenomena.

                    Check out ring species like the Arctic Tern or the California Newt.  Their geographical range is annular, ring-shaped.
Each local gene pool can breed with its neighbors, but not with the distant gene pool “across” on the other side of the ring.
One species? If not, how many? Reality escapes our categorical net one more time.

        I believe the viciousness with which Progs is at least partially driven by their own insecurities.  There has to be a small corner of their minds that recognized that there is no foundation to their crazy beliefs.  That kernel of doubt doesn’t make them honestly question and evaluate their faith – rather it makes them all the more desperate to defend it.
Recognizing they can’t use logic as a weapon, they instead reach for personal slander and Orwellian language and rules to attack their foes.

        As CogDis isn’t a thing in their world, I expect the transition from “there’s no such thing as race” to “of course some races are better than others” to be seamless… and that’s when the *real* fun begins.

            that transition would bring the progressives right back to where they were 100 years ago.  of course their pose that all races are similar/equal is just a ruse for the rubes, in order to gain political power.  i.e. they never stopped being racists.

        Natural selection for increased cognitive function (e.g. the intelligence adaptation) was largely driven by the high variability of environmental change (seasonality) in the higher latitudes of northern Europe and in central Europe following the last Ice Age. The challenges associated with surviving a long winter of food deprivation enhanced traits for resourcefulness and long-term prediction/planning. Robustness in a severely changing environment necessitates both mental and physical prowess.
In our modern world, environmental extremes are now nearly extinct.

        One of the areas of biological evolution open to serious debate is the pace of change. The standard model is a slow (very slow) continuous process with very subtle differences between individual “links” in the evolutionary chain. The idea that evolution could, or did, happen in relatively quick spurts, without a lot of intermediary steps, is probably best captured by Gould’s punctuated equilibrium. In response to rapid environmental change, species will have a corresponding rapid phylogenetic change. It’s a tough thing to tease out of the fossil and geologic record.If true, or at least a significant part of the picture, it would seem to make sense that subpopulations of critters could rapidly evolve in response to self-inflicted environmental stresses, like moving from a cold climate to a warm one or visa-versa. Given enough subgroup change, and fast enough, distinct but closely related species could evolve in multiple places on the planet at the same time in time spans measured in centuries instead of millennia. Might make for some interesting social dynamics between the groups once they come back together.

            I’m very solidly in the fits and starts camp. I think reason and the data back the idea that evolution slumbers along and then races along in response to triggering events like climate change.

            does evolution “just happen” or is it part of some observable process?  if the former, then…I don’t now what to say;  if the latter, then let’s figure out what that process is.  we know bits and pieces, like how viruses can transport bits of dna from one species to another.  but as far as i can tell, not a lot of work has been done to figure the underlying mechanism for speciation.problem is, biology is a soft science and the people working in it aren’t that smart.  need top physicists and chemists (a specialized branch or physics) working on it, instead of concocting nonsense theories about the start of the universe.

                    are you really saying biology isn’t derived from physics?  are you really saying biology as a discipline is more academically challenging than physics or chemistry?
please tell me who the equivalent biologist to Einstein is.
for fukk’s sake, biologists can’t even find a cure for a single virus.  penicillin was only “discovered” by accident, or so the story goes.
i am guessing you have some vested interest in maintaining the illusion that biology is a “hard” science.

                        Karl,I am a lurker but, I have had a very long day, soooo….I am a biologist, a fisheries biologist to be exact. My calling utilizes not only chemistry but, also physics, and calculus. Plus a whole lot of mental formations of the issues that confront me.I work in a multi dimensional environment as it pertains to the subjects of my inquiry.  I enjoy your banter with others on this Excellent blog.We do our best with the tools we have at hand (and can afford). As do most biologists.Most of the men and women I work with all agree about the adsurdity of “settled science “.  We do have the “chicken little ” biologists of global warming. I and others argue with them at the drop of a hat.Biology is far from soft. Nothing is unquestionable. The best biology is working to disprove your own hypothesis.

                                    You would be the guy to ask.

            The fascinating observation that conjoined twins have a workable shared circulatory system indicates that our genetically determined anatomy is a specific realization of a rough sketch, with lots of interpolation allowed. So a single mutation that somehow modifies the rough sketch can have large effects – for example, 6 fingers rather than 5. This tends to support punctuated equilibrium.

        David Berliinski is a trip.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ1eiK1xx_EHe is an extraordinarily accomplished man, and scientist. This is a four minute vid debunking Darwinian Theory. He opened my eyes when nothing else had. There are many more lengthy videos, all well worth seeing. Bye the bye or not, he is an agnostic. He doesn’t have the answers, which in our age of enforced agreement, is an answer.

the above link is a site run by a most peculiar fellow.  he is convinced he is a modern day neanderthal, and that N’s were enslaved by “melon heads” in order to harness the N’s greater technological abilities.   he’s batshit crazy, but entertaining.

        I question the knowability of how life moved off of the Periodic Table of Elements and into the biochemical soup. A repeatable experiment would help, and it’s well worth the continued effort to pursue such.
These modern “prophets” are amusing in how they rush forth with a new round of fables at each new discovery, without ever quite moving off of the arrogant faith that their theories are “what’s True”.
If it keeps scientists off the streets, that’s swell; but I can’t fathom how it affects the sidereal motion that tomorrow we’ll dub “sunrise”.

                I daresay (Biochemistry course 15 years ago; pretty much got destroyed) that we’re much farther off from grasping the subtleties of the genome database than we flatter ourselves (at least in the media).
Even having understood the static information in the chromosomes, there’s the whole protein folding bit.

                    i think a better approach to figuring things out, is to look at dna as a software program.  the nucleotides are the primitives that make up the “language” the program is coded in.  figure out how that language works, and you unlock the secret to life.

                    The information in engineered objects is very compressible and therefore understandable – for what is “understanding” but a brief description of a long story?The history of evolved things like “life” is very different. Added information of incomprehensible subtlety has been accruing for billions of years.. A change in the peptide sequence of an enzyme, far from the “active site”, may after the protein folds modify the geometry of the active site by a few picometres, for weal or woe.We’re looking at the accumulation of what worked better, and we will never understand it in the Maxwell / Feynmann way. It’s not regular enough to be boiled down like that.I don’t think this supports a claim that biology is dumb.

        First they came after conservatives and I did not speak out—Because I was not much into politics.
Then they came after to employers, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a employer and felt I had enough room for duck and cover.
Then they came after the Christians and I did not speak out—Because I was not a practicing Christian.
Then thought police came after for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
I have no one to blame.

        i don’t have a dog in this fight, so what follows isn’t a big deal to me if you disagree 🙂
primates are found in tropical areas, not cold assed places like europe.  yes southern europe is temperate but there are no primates there, either.  so unless europe was real warm 7m years ago, humans didn’t evolve there. if someone knows, or wants to look up, when the last ice age in europe began, post it here and we see if there was a warm era.

                    The fact they are finding fossils of mammoths and saber tooth tigers on the floor of the English channel and the North Sea indicates our climate in Europe was very different. Animals, and probably humans, didn’t have to contend with natural barriers we have today and since the North Sea was a land bridge, anyone heading west, north-west could cross quite easily.
But I agree, getting wrapped up in one’s theory is non-sense. They disprove “the proven” all the time. Ego is a dangerous thing, and not just in science, but politics and religion.

                        “… indicates our climate in Europe was very different. ….”Of course it was!Everbody knows that woolly mammoths and saber tooth tigers drove giant SUVs and generated electricity by burning lignite coal and farting too much (imagine all that methane for mammoth farts!!).By GOD!! No wonder the ice sheets melted.

                        The fact is that the ice-ages suddenly appeared only very recently–2.5 million years ago–affecting Africa no less than Europe, if for different reasons. That number seems very significant in human development, a human bingo cage. Peak cold meant peak drought for Africa when over 90% of it would be parched into desert. Unknown numbers of humanoids rose and fell with those tides of great change until Erectus and his 800 cc brain stuck  everywhere there were humans, from Africa to the Pacific. The tides kept coming in and Neanderthal, Dravidians, Cro-Magnon, and unknown others were carved  out of Erectus into their peculiar shapes  by those tides. Some Mastodon hunters were  even left with absurd talents such as calculus, but nobody knows why.My lineage  may well be Erectus, who was not homo-Sapien,  but it is not Bantu, which is homo-Sapien. This seems simple enough. We think of evolution as a happy event because it represents a happy result, but it is everywhere and at all times a process of tragedy.

                            Thanks James. A good sweep of human history for me to remember. I am kind of shocked to think of a modern Erectus form. I peviously had no question about the ‘ settled science’ of African evolution.   Now I wonder about who are the modern forms of Erectus .

            Well, Gibraltar has the barbary apes, likely migrants from Morocco, where they are also still found. The skull of one was also found in northern Ireland, dating from 300 B.C., in theory. Morocco (particularly up in the Middle Atlas, has a temperate climate in the north. I’m inclined to consider the case still open. Like you, I have no dog in the fight, but the recent find does pique one’s interest.

        Good heavens. Apparently some people in the alt-right-ish sphere feel so insecure that they are compelled to grasp at any straw to attack the out-of-Africa hypothesis, which is (a) most likely true and (b) completely irrelevant to any judgment of the group identity and accomplishments of Europeans. I understand the sentiment — some of my compatriots used to feel so bad about themselves that they had to insist on such preposterous nonsense as, e.g, that elephants originated in Ukraine, and some blacks insist on even more preposterous nonsense such as e.g. that Ancient Greeks, Chinese and Koreans were black — but it does not reflect well on those who entertain it.

            Nobody is grasping except the SJW and his government funded academic and scientist, who embaces that pose in a permanent state.  If a factoid or two causes the SJW to gasp, that’s intended as sport first and  science second.

            Considering all the recent, not yet fossilized mammoths in Siberia, plus a little continental drift, elephant progenitors in Ukraine might not be unreasonable.
