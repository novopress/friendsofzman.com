        Blank ballots or donkey votes (voting 1-4 down the line) exist but are not that common. Those are mostly new migrants who don’t speak English.Protest votes by people enraged at being forced to vote (or whatever) are extremely rare. Out of many thousands, I only saw one. The boxes were unnumbered and they’d scrawled “THE ALIENS ARE COMING” across the paper.The correspondent has no way of knowing this. All he can state with possible confidence is that theblatantrandom or protest votes are rare. It’s just as easy to, as Derb says, vote for crazy or random candidates, but not do so in a recognizable pattern.Also, the unengaged but compliant are even worse than the protestors. They make their dumb, uninformed vote, canceling out the votes of people who actually understand the issues. Compulsory voting is awful.

        Australian-style preferential voting would be overkill here, but I’d like to see “instant runoff”, where voters are allowed (not required) to indicate a second choice in addition to their first. If no candidate gets a majority of the first place votes, the candidate with the fewest is dropped and his second-choice votes are added to the indicated candidates. Repeat until someone has a majority.This system would allow someone to vote for the candidate (s)he truly prefers, even if it’s a minor party, without worrying that it will throw the election to the greater of the major-party evils. Green supporters, for instance, could select the Democrat as their second choice, and the end result would be the same as if they’d held their noses and voted Democrat to begin with.

        As to licking their lips, Pelosi-Kamala-McConnel are planning a jubilant replay of Jan. 6th, Street Version.  Kind of like a overlarge Palestinian Protest.
Only this time, since they are still in charge of arrangements, they’ll call in the National Guard so they can spend the next four years painting Trump as Herr Diktator.

        The Dems had semi-truckloads of fake ballots ready to go at 1 am for the ‘surprise’; they arrived to the swing district counting centers only to meet Lara Trump’s battalions of RNC lawyers (and cops!) waiting for them. Up to 500 attorneys per state! Lara used the RNC monies for more than shoes, drapes, and junkets.
Thus, the expected surprise was foiled. Of course they were going to try again.Kamala told us as much in her concession speech. She even wore her magic earrings to make sure we got that straight!

        Here in the USA, completely answering the decennial census is compulsory. Now in my 60s, I have never done so, though once or twice I returned it with the number of occupants at the address and nothing else. I once got a threatening letter for my failure to answer the “business census” but nothing came of any of my refusals.
