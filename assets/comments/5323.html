        I have to admit, I thought there was no way CNN would ever let Fiorina onto the big stage.  The media only understands that “chick = liberal;” a conservative woman, even one who is only “conservative” in the loosest, most technical Mitt Romney sense, screws up their heuristic.  In the media’s tiny pea brain, I thought, Hillary is The Woman, and like the Highlander, there can be only one — to be puffed up beyond the stars like Hillary, or hit-pieced to death, Palin-style.Maybe Hillary’s in even worse shape than we thought, and the media are all bailing out before the indictments come down.Then again, all this presumes that it’s really the media calling the shots.  That theory has worked out pretty well in the past, but with Trump doing so well, they’re obviously panicking…. either way, it ought to be interesting to see how they treat Fiorina if she does even so-so in the upcoming debates.
