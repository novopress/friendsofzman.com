        I really have no problem with racism.  I’m a firm believer in the freedom of association.  The Civil Rights Act should be repealed.  All anti-discrimination laws should be repealed.  In short, we should, as our founders intended, be left to live in peace aswechoose to live, rather than have politicians performing social experimentation.Much of the so called “anti-racist” are infuriating hypocrites, morally preening, while they stereotype and pigeon hole with the best of them.  I find it refreshing when someone is directly honest about how they feel and what they think, without having to worry about signalling for social status.  That’s all the diversity flag is: a signal for social status that allows a racist to pretend they are not.

        I have zero interest in identifying as white, and think as little of Jared Taylor, as I do of Mr. Genius Coates. I think the proper response to fools is to demand they demonstrate their competence and ridicule them when they try to substitute ethnicity for reason and effort. Tim

                Do you think Isaac Newton identified as ‘white’?One shouldn’t turn skin color into a major part of one’s ‘identity’ (of course, the politically correct do just that).There’s no need to build up – or tear down – ‘whiteness’.What we’re seeing with this Nancy Drew thing is a particular aversion to whiteness. We’re seeing something unnatural and racist. Like I said, it ought to be impossible for someone to say “this person is ‘diverse&#x27;”, it’s a ridiculous, illogical proposition.What they’re really saying is “we don’t want anyone white”.Here’s another way to look at it. Does an African president look at his countrymen and say “we’re shockingly black”?An ordinary black guy in Africa doesn’t “identify as a black man”, he simply *is* black.

                    “Do you think Isaac Newton identified as ‘white’?”Yes.“One shouldn’t turn skin color into a major part of one’s ‘identity’”This contradicts nearly all of the human condition.  And BTW, the differences go deeper than skin.“We’re seeing something unnatural and racist.”Racism is in fact natural and a fundamental part of human nature.  Whatisunnatural is how so many whites are taught to hate themselves for being proud of being white, of being proud of their heritage, and tear down any who may display that pride.“An ordinary black guy in Africa doesn’t “identify as a black man”, he simply *is* black.”Unbelievable.  Black Africans are incredibly racist towards other black Africans, dividing by the gradations of skin tone.  That shows up here in America, where blacks are just as racist towards each other, based on how light or dark a black person’s skin is (there is as tense a race divide between light skinned black Americans and dark skinned, as there is between black and white).  Are you really unaware of this?  Do you not know any black people?

        So are we on this blog, right now, ready to self-identify as White Nationalists?  Not White Superiority, but White Nationalism, a la Jared Taylor and American Renaissance?  I am, but every time I bring it up I’m run outta Blogtown on a rail, esp. over at NRO and Ace.
If we here aren’t ready to proclaim pride in our Euroethnic heritage, and share that with sites that are supposed to be our friends, then how can we expect those Commie apologists to ever treat us with respect as equals and not the Great White Oppressor?

        Exactly the reason I have stopped watching a lot of movies (and frequently turn off TV shows after a few minutes). Stories now have to be ‘non-white diverse’, so we see at least one non-white person in a key role (think Costner’s Robin Hood with Morgan Freeman showing how to make gunpowder) or more troubling, the vast number of white female leads in bed with black men.I do wonder whether the white female lead who is dreamily smooching with the black man might just be thinking: ‘an artist must suffer for her art’ but as it pays, I expect it will continue. I just don’t have to watch it because, in the end, I don’t believe it. I may be willing to suspend disbelief when it comes to elves with swords, spaceships where nothing important is ever affected when it is under attack (you know how they always take a lot of non-essential equipment on a spaceship) and the way bullets magically only break the back window of a fleeing car but never go any further forward, but non-white diversity everywhere and in every era is just too unbelievable.

        For me, the most startling thing is that they said Nancy Drew will be “diverse”.Once you’re able to look at a black man and say “he is diverse” and at a while man and say “he is not diverse”, you’ve gone insane.It means a country which is 90% black and 10% white is “90% diverse”. And a country like Somalia is “100% diverse”. A human being cannot be “diverse”.It also means that muslims (whom the race obsessed imagine are a race because that’s how demented their ideology is) can never be “intolerant”. If they don’t tolerate anything a non-Muslim says, draws or wears, it can only mean that they were provoked by intolerant people who didn’t respect their religious feelings.This follows naturally from being willing to say that someone black is “diverse” and someone white is not. Once you do that, “intolerance” will subtly be defined as something which can only be done to darker-skinned individuals.People get used to names. Just like no one thinks “I’m so hungry I could eat a horse” means you’d eat a horse, people will accept any term, any name, but this is the path to madness, to only being able to say bad things about certain ethnic or religious groups and only good things about others. Of course, that all begins with the bizarre quest for “ethnic diversity”, which in itself is so obviously retarded that it’s been rephrased simply as “diversity”, from which follows that “someone *is* “diverse” if they aren’t light skinned.One should at least interject in any such conversation and say “you mean ‘ethnic diversity’, not “diversity” generally” and “what do you mean she is “diverse”, don’t speak in euphemisms, let’s say what we mean, that she won’t be white”.

        Mud brick was beyond them.That says something.Anyone else notice how… uniform… are the Department heads of the current Administration?  The few not black, are gay?  This is an occupation by hostiles.  People with big chips on their shoulders.The Africans tell me the same story.The Ethiopian says that the majority, Ahamsa 40%,  plus Oromo 25%, are ruled by the Tligani 10%- who are all the politicians, businessmen, and officers, they own everything.The Sierra Leonan says all Africa is the same-  everyone from the bodyguards to the President is the same tribe, intent on looting the country for their own.  The others tribes scheme to seize the government that they may steal everything for THEIR own.Here in the White world, we have Hatfields versus McCoys, and the Hatfields think they have found a big bunch of new friends.The brute strength of overpopulation is beginning to show it’s hand.Those who invented the first era of surplus in human history could not know that a consequence of surplus would be fewer kids.Now the teeming hordes eye the glittering, empty cities of the North, and are coming to take them.  With the help of their Hatfield friends.

                    Right now the only issue is that the West must regain its self-confidence and protect itself. No one likes someone who is full of himself. A little introspection and self-deprecation is a good thing. But no one likes someone who self-flagellates and berates himself constantly and this is what Western society is doing these days. A healthy sense of civilizational self-confidence is a must.Had America been so ‘sensitive’ in the 30’s, it would have objected to anyone saying anything bad about Hitler and about the Nazis. Arguing instead that we “shouldn’t judge” and that our anti-Nazi attitude “offends” people. We’d then expect anyone of German heritage to talk about how wonderful Hitler is and then we’d talk about how we should celebrate their cultural identity and about the terrible casualties we’re inflicting on the poor German population.And Obama would argue that even if we could bring Jews over from Germany it would be utterly wrong and shameful to give them precedence over German Nazis because “that’s not who we are” and that only a small percentage of the German population are fighting us. That’s his excuse for not giving precedence to Christian Arabs over Muslim Arabs. Unbelievable.

        I am dismayed that Nancy Drew will be cast as non-white. As a girl I read every one of those books and Nancy Drew was clearly white and often described as having Titian hair, which to me has always meant strawberry-blonde, but I guess red hair is the more accurate description. I know this is small potatoes, but seriously, why must the Progressives ruin everything?

            It’s Trotskyite Cultural Marxism: the object isn’t to replace the culture with something different or “better” (either subjectively or objectively); rather, the only goal is to destroy with maximum psychological effect. Shitting on it is more demoralizing to its adherents than simply competing with it or trying to replace it.
