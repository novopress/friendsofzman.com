        Living in Asia now 2+ years.  People ask me if I would like to go back to the U.S.  I respond, yea, would like to go back to America circa 1963.  The current America is a lunatic asylum.
Admittedly, there are pockets of normalcy.  But overall it’s a disaster, soon to approach South African levels I suspect.

            Smart choice. I live in one of those pockets of normalcy, and when I venture out into the larger American culture, especially after being away from it for months on end, it sometimes makes me gasp.

                    When ever I go out in I observe the White men that I see and do a mental exercise of imagining an armed robbery/terrorist attack occurring. I size them up and try to assess who could be counted on. Not that I am Rambo but less than 10% of men that I see look like they would offer any resistance. The quality of America’s White population, men and women, has degraded drastically and is incredibly poor.

                    From what I observe, the obesity epidemic seems to be receding a bit. But, yeah, the land whales are appalling and ubiquitous.

                Very true…My wife and I were in a hospital emergency room waiting, and we were the only people, male or female, who weren’t over 200 lbs…Women over 200 used to be so rare that they were in freak shows….and when I was in junior high, not one person in my class was overweight…

                    Freak show. Yes, between the tats, piercings, gender bending, hair dye, obesity, etc… The US is basically a giant carny act, a sideshow to a global circus that refuses to leave town when the county fair closes.

                    My h.s. football coach required in our drills that every single player, including the 270 lb behemoth I had to carry 10+ times up four flights of stairs as warm ups during wrestling practice, would run a sub six minute mile. Some puked, a few quit, nobody who remained failed to go over six. Today, kids there can’t handle marching band.

                    If sideshows were still a thing, The Skinny Lady would be an exhibit. And, yeah, a friend and I looked at an elementary school class picture recently and she observed that the “fat girl” would not even be noticed now. As I noted above, the obesity epidemic seems to be in the beginning stages of decline, ever so slight, along with tats, piercings and other forms of body mutilation.

            “Asia” – wherever you are – has its own problems. The USA is just reverting to the historical norm of living standards in a powerful empire. We are leaving behind an era of plenty which is ahistorical and rare. A true golden age. You can still see the golden-age America in some spots, like where I live, but the days of Muskogee being better than almost any large Asian city are gone.Is the USA still a great place to live? Yes and no. It depends on your temperament. For third world peasants, yes definitely; of course. For the strivers? Maybe. For the super-rich? Maybe. 40 years ago, an unequivocal yes for all these questions.

                Sure.  Where I live in “Asia”, there be problems.  But people aren’t at each others throats over meaningless consumer crap.  The chances of a random negro killing my family members is zero.  The economy is not built on debt.  The media is not entirely owned by someone whose name ends in stein.  The place has not been at war for 100 years.  The women are not certifiably insane.  Gay people are left alone and not thrust into the heights of societal control.  Interesting enough my “Asian” neighbors don’t despise me with a burning hot hatred.Only a bit of that normalcy can presently be found in America.  And you’ve got to look pretty hard to find it,

                        I’m the last to defend modern White women, most of whom I despise.  However, marrying an Asian – no matter how slim – is no panacea.  Most Asian women are not nearly as compliant as White men think.  And she will file for and import every last member of her extended family, and your hapa children will never be genuine White European Americans.  End result is still White genocide, so what’s the point?

                            But here’s the deal. The only reason I’d like to live in a place like NYC would be the restaurants and cultural amenities such as museums and classical music concerts. However, drones can’t deliver those. You have to wade through the mudslide to get to them, and once you get there, you’ll find the people in control of them are hostile to you and your people. Face it. We are people without a country, and that fact will be driven home to you in no uncertain terms if you live in a leftopolis.

                                Oh, I agree. I was just thinking of some odd scenario where maybe you can have access to a trust fund but the crazy uncle who set it up requires you to live in Manhattan.

                                I was born in NYC.  So I admit a bias of sorts and a preconditioning to wading through the slime of the city.  Hell, I even rode the damn Subway for nostalgia when last I was there.  But yes, I understand the “no-go” areas of the city during the day.  And most of the city is to be avoided at night.It’s the culture via the museums and entertainment that I miss, not so much the people–most of whom never really experience the museums and such as I would enjoy.Perhaps I’d get bored with that as well, but with money you can leave easily when you’ve had enough.  Just like here in AZ, many folk simply vanish come the summer heat wave and live in the mountains or travel up North.

                Asia offers the choice of living in a more homogeneous culture — as an outsider.You will never be fully a part of the society unless you learn the language and conform to a high degree and even then look at the Chinese diaspora in other Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia — tolerated, but envied for their business acumen and viewed with stone-hot jealousy.— G.N.

            Indeed. And Z’s post for today is incredibly apposite for me. Just yesterday I was strolling across a university campus and saw a bearded lady. You read that right. A bearded effen lady. It had tits, an hourglass figure and a bleedin’ beard! I just stopped, turned ’round and stared at it with my jaw bouncing off the sidewalk as it walked away from me.What the hell is this world coming to? Increasingly, I get the distinct impression that God and Satan are at war in AINO and that the latter clearly has the upper hand. I didn’t think that was possible.We’re late in the fourth quarter and Satan, leading by a touchdown, is on God’s two-yard-line and is trying to punch in the winning score. We need Team Satan to fumble and for one of God’s defensive backs to scoop it up and return it for a TD.

                “Just yesterday I was strolling across a university campus”-Well, there’s  your problem right there, LOL. One of the most striking changes  in my life is how universities have metamorphosized from institutions of open inquiry and free speech into feminized, ideological, totalitarian freak shows.I spent thirty years either studying or working in colleges and universities. For most of that time it felt perfectly natural and for most of it I had no idea what to do with myself off campus.Now, five years after getting kicked out of my last sub-minimum wage teaching job, I can’t even fathom stepping onto a campus ever again.I happened to be traveling last week and ended up in a nice Midwestern college town. I stopped for dinner across the street from the campus. Gazing at it as I ate, I was shocked at how utterly foreign, alien and inhospitable it seemed to me.The universities are no longer populated by Socratics debunking the shadow-myths of Plato’s cave — they are the creators and promulgators of the false shadow-myths.

                    I’ve spent my entire adult life in academia, in one capacity or another, so I know of what you speak. Alas, the New Left began conquering the academy in the late 60s and twenty years later it was all over but the crying. Now the Left’s hegemony is so absolute that there are no constraints to rein in the madness and degeneracy. Unfortunately, academia, which is the engine of the Left, has contaminated the rest of society to such an extent that the difference between the two is now almost negligable. Coca Cola is now arguably to the left of Cornell’s sociology department. Thirty years ago, that would have been unimaginable.

Peer Pressure.
It’s damned near omnipotent when wielded upon herd creatures.
It’s why they’re all v@xxinated.
They just had to follow the herd, right over the edge of the cliff.
And that’s another thing which the Gubmint has co-opted; Madison Avenue doesn’t control public opinion anymoar so much as do the pronouncements from the various gubmint authorities exercising the droit deArgumentum ad verecundiam.

                            I think you are probably right about the link between AA and Boeing s problems. There is no “white algebra” or “Asian algebra” or “black algebra”. There’s algebra, there’s physics and there is of course reality. And you want to be familiar with those when you’re building spaceships and airliners. And what Boeing s leadership did is unforgivably stupid and irresponsible

            I just got back from three weeks in Taiwan a few days ago, a place I’ve lived in or visited almost every year since the late 90’s.  Every time I go, the gulf between the femininity of Taiwanese women and the horror show of American women gets just a little bit wider.  It’s always jarring to see an Asian woman, who would now be considered a smoke show in the West, hanging off the arm of some skinny local geek.  The men in that part of the world are incapable of understanding what they have.

            I lived in Eastern Asia for over a decade. Had to move back to the US for a variety of reasons but in many ways it is a hard transition. The combination of the fatness and slovenliness of the White population is symbolic of the general decline.In Asia, Asians and many White expats feel free to speak their minds. Depressing to try to have a conversation with White men in America and see the self censorship even when no one else is around. And yes, the Asian women are far superior to western white women no matter what the Dissident Right might think.

                Aye.  While waiting for a street vendor to make me a couple fruit juices, he asked me about the cause of the problems in the States.  It felt freeing to say “黑人太多了“ （”too many blacks”) without a second thought.
The poz exists in small ways here and there, but they still have a lot of catching up to do.  My chief complaint, though is the conformity and lack of distrust of their leaders.

                        I always harken back to my first trip to Taiwan in 1997.  First world infrastructure but third world traffic.  Well, over the last quarter century they took steps to rectify that, adding turning lanes, traffic control devices, left turn signals at intersections, etc.  And things got much better.  But then they continued by putting cameras everywhere, to catch you stopping your vehicle just beyond the white stripe at a red light, running a yellow light, going a single kmph over the speed limit, etc.  The eye of Sauron is watching you at all times and running your license plate through a database.While I appreciate the increase in safety and predictability, I miss the devil-may-care lifestyle that existed not very long ago.  Yet, there will never be an organized political movement to ask, “Is this too much?  Do we really want to totally eliminate the concept of privacy?” If officialdom decrees this how things will be, that’s good enough for the masses.

                    Yeah, there was a great scene where some of Sopranos guys went to shake down a new juice store for protection money. But it was a corporate shop, so the manager is explaining to them that every dime is accounted for by the computer system.
He’d have to give them the money from his own salary, which wasn’t much. He told them that he’d rather just quit and get a job down the street.
They just walked out and left the place alone.

            I can see the Totally Legitimate Businessman’s Social Club 😉 making a comeback since government has been abandoning its core functions, like say policing. If the price of having a big bunch of neckless thugs remind members of A Certain Demographic “They should leave this neighborhood before there’s trouble, Capisce?” is paying tribute monthly, well, so be it.
How many Blue Enclaves pay extortionate taxes and another set of thugs extort them? Whattaya gettin’ for yer money, eh?

                        Someone here or another place I regularly read wrote that prosperity in America is measured by the ability to live as far as possible from diversity and have the luxury to sing its praises loudest. I have heard from several people I trust that the place where they saw the most BLM signs was…the University of Vermont, perhaps the whitest place in the United States. The psychological damage that has been inflicted is immense. I do recommend highly moving as far away as possible from diversity, but be wary of those who follow you there.

                            That’s a Sailer axiom. And he’s correct. What this means, functionally, is living in a lily-white suburb of a large metropolis. And, as has been mentioned in this site frequently, a lack of experience with real negroes–as opposed to those carefully curated by universities–correlates positively adoration of the Hutu. Such white people are like toddlers who see a panther in a zoo and put their arm through the bars to try to pet it.

                            It’s the locust system. Trade, churn, consume. The person who becomes a refugee is the first to be consumed— and he works hard for it, has been convinced he’s making it. Only temporarily, as you note, because it follows and drives him off again. Quite a trick somebody pulled. Stand and die once (or maybe not?), or die a thousand certain small deaths on the way. Crazy, I know, but I think it’s true! I mean, it’s not like people didn’t suffer and die building this thing. Why should we expect less to keep it?

                The government will never totally abandoned policing, because one of the cops’ functions is to protect government offices and personnel. They’re like private security for the well-to-do. If, on the other hand, the burbs were ever to be abandoned and the criminal element were to move in, the taxpayers might actually start to vote in municipal elections and drive the non-police-funding government apparatchiks out of office …— G.N.

                    The only purpose of the police is to support and protect the interests of the ruling class. Your interests are protected only when they are compatible with those of our rulers, or sometimes when not protecting them might cause unrest.
This truth is becoming more clear as the ruling class becomes more degenerate and stupid. It now lacks the subtlety to protect and promote itself while not openly shitting on the peasantry.

        The porn industry would collapse if prostitution was legalized &amp; feminists will fight it tooth &amp; nail for obvious reasons. Soon that won’t matter though, good luck enforcing such things with legalized brown crime &amp; the demographics of Tijuana.We’re currently in this sweet spot where the state still has enough might to enforce their will while also allowing chaos among the favored groups but that can’t be maintained forever with open borders &amp; an affirmative action mandate. With that we have a few things to look forward to, most obvious one is law enforcement becoming inept &amp; with that a severe decline in ability to maintain anarcho tyranny. Eventually it will dawn on people that you no longer need to worry so much about following arbitrary rules designed for the sole purpose of protecting savages because the people enforcing said rules have room temperature IQs.With any luck they’ll keep defunding the police, for a long long time now they have only existed to protect criminals &amp; enforce leftist rules. It’s not an exaggeration to say that if not for them blacks would’ve been wiped off the map ages ago both from letting them kill each other &amp; from letting Whites enact real justice.We can also expect to see non english speaking politicians getting elected who don’t bother with any bullshit pretense of being american with everything that entails,  both good &amp; bad, once all the geriatrics currently in power age out.What I most look forward to is watching negroes despair at the utterly predictable loss of their privileged political status &amp; later their brutal ethnic cleansing by the people they voted to import. The fact that they’re mostly allowed to murder each other without consequence will further accelerate their decline. There’s no reason to think California is an outlier in how that will play out, just like in that state they’re going to be the first demographic casualty of open borders across the country. It was funny seeing the new york times wringing their hands about how it’s basically over for blacks in Cali a while back, of course they won’t say why.Only unfortunate thing is they won’t realize until it’s too late, between them being utter morons &amp; the media refusing to report on their cleansing it’ll come as a complete surprise to them. It’s regrettable that it won’t be be slow &amp; agonizing process for them like it has been for us, sometimes ignorance really is bliss.

            This is why the United States is sorting and fragmenting, and soon will be Balkanizing. People who condemn Britain’s two-tier justice system sometimes miss a larger point–only white Britons even can be policed. That is going away there and soon will happen here and throughout what once was the West. They will get the anarchy, but the tyranny is at best tenuous.

                Wemustgatekeep liberal centrists, leftists, sentimental “they were just brainwashed into being savage supremacists” types &amp; the “White people dindu nuffin, all the blame falls on the jews they allowed into the country &amp; sided with against their own” reality deniers from our midst once people start concentrating into enclaves.The latter two types aren’t hyper subversive on their own but will act as a sort of chain migration / weakening of the immune system that will ultimately allow the explicit predators in. That’s how it always starts, let one infected person in &amp; next thing you know the entire system is compromised.We need to be like the muslims with their absolutism towards even milquetoast subversives, you don’t see LGBBQ shit in countries with hard line sharia law because the second they discover someone’s a sprite they get the roof. That’s what we need to do, healthy Whites need to be quarantined with a policy of expulsion, even slaughter if necessary, of anyone with a hint of utopian leftism about them.Some sort of prescriptive political ideology will have to be invented &amp; founded with a single city that’s dominated by it &amp; is fiercely guarded. From that we can work on becoming the new jews &amp; eternal anglos who subvert &amp; ethnically cleanse the country molding it in our image generation after generation just as they did. Instead of their utopian bullshit we’ll be extreme pragmatic realists &amp; instead of dysgenic supremacy we’ll lionize the strong &amp; healthy.As long as we’re grounded in reality we will survive &amp; ultimately thrive, denying it in favor of flowery feel good bullshit is what brought us to this point.

                        I’d go a step further &amp; throw out almost every concept the founders sewed into American law, the vast majority of it was all based fantasy, extremely utopian optimism &amp; was myopically reactionary to the crown.I could write a whole book on the subject but I’ll just say that I question nearly everything that emanated from their minds given they had their heads so far up their own asses they genuinely believed muslims would make for fine American citizens.Given their track record I consider it a miracle, perhaps even an aberration of thought that they gave us the second amendment. Even that was extremely flawed &amp; was made with assumptions about the populace that were proven false less than a century &amp; a half after its inception.

            I think the competency crisis is real but that it is also overblown and used as a cope by our side. The Regime is not being incompetent by purging White men from all institutions that enforce the law and require force to enforce its desires. (the military)This is the intent. The goal is to remove White men from monopoly on violence and eliminate us as a threat to them. A side goal is to reward their client class. I think they also have a goal of Whites being policed instead of doing the policing. I would not celebrate the coming deep corruption and ethnic strife that them shifting one ethnic group to police another will bring about. That is intentional. It will not be good.We also need to understand that they are also removing us from the lower and lower middle class and replacing us with blacks. Every business I used to frequent always had Whites or non-blacks working at it. Since St. George overdosed every business I frequent has almost all black employees. This includes the Apple Store in tony areas, and Eataly. It is bizarre to go into Eataly and be in Africa. Even the fancy party room in that store was deep hood culture.Our underclass will grow and be forced to live beside their underclass. Worse, their underclass or cartels and gangs will do the policing. This is a tragedy for our people.Our mission is to get ourselves prepared to be the dominant minority. We have a tall order because our striver class is on the vanguard of our dispossession. While all of the minorities are openly hostile and at war with us, our striver class is on their side. We can overcome this, but we need to stop taking consolation in foreseeing the demise of other minorities. That consolation may not even arise. The entire world is being purposely settled on our shores and purposely scattered everywhere. They are also being subsidized by our money.Now, if a large number of Asians come, and that is in their plan, then what you foresee may come about. But that isn’t certain either. Perhaps Hans and Dravidians are perfectly content to live in their gated communities and let the other groups fight it out as an underclass. Will they cast out the blacks from the patronage jobs at some point? Who knows. I wouldn’t count on it.Whatever it is, we need to focus on us. A desire for revenge and foreseeing the demise of the low that the high used to bash us to pieces is understandable. However, we must forget about revenge and think about how we are going to get control so we don’t live in the favellas. That is what the regime and their clients have in motion for us.We need skills. We need wealth. We need strong local clusters. We need to defend and assert our authority in our localities. We need our own cultural transmission mechanisms that are robust and bring our future into its fold

                Given yourself away. Eataly, really? NYC upperclass tourist dump if I’ve ever seen one. That’s why our people don’t get ahead. We vote with our resources in cities and locales that are hostile instead of building better. So many towns for expansion that don’t need to rely on dollar stores, fast food idiocy or other chains. If our people spent and invested money in newer and non-hostile locales and move to em like zman did, we might have a chance. Instead we still spend money in the fucking EU and at the apple store.

                I’d much rather have an alien race putting boots on our necks than our own people &amp; if they’re going to utter morons as has been the case across the entire country with the severe lowering of standards in an attempt to keep police numbers from utterly collapsing then that’s even better.Its a lot easier to mentally mark racial aliens as the enemy than someone who looks like you. If every cop was an openly anti White ooga booga gorilla I doubt the thin blue line police worshipper types would continue to lick those boots so hard. Also if you really believe the negroes, who are the highest form of diversity second only to trannies &amp; thus the most sought after hires, have the means enforce anarcho tyranny as effectively as Whites then I have to assume you’re fully in agreement with leftists about their kang status.I don’t think the competence crisis has been overblown at all, if anything it’s being under reported, there has been a significant increase in corruption in all these newly diversified government agencies that I virtually never see discussed. Fed resources being pissed away on such things is a good thing in my book.I think you underestimate just how much chaos has ensued as a result of defunding the police &amp; chaos that at worst doesn’t fundamentally change anything on our end. The amount of corruption that has ensued from defunding the police &amp; lowering standards is off the charts which is wasting fed resources. That applies to every single organization that hires blacks &amp; that’s the highest form of diversity second only to trannies so everything is going to become africanized. The state run electric company in my state is exclusively hiring blacks &amp; the government outlawed private commercial vehicle schools &amp; charges several thousand dollars to Whites but gives it to negroes for free. The cities have diversity quotas for infrastructure work, NASDAQ wants to impose diversity quotas on corporate executives in order to be listed on stock exchanges. Every single facet of our society is being africanized &amp; if you want to know how that ends take a look at Detroit, was the competency crisis overblown there too? We’ll be lucky to have clean water &amp; electricity down the road but somehow those same people will be more effective at enforcing shitlib diktats that currently define the anarcho tyranny we see now? Call me a skeptic but I sincerely doubt that. I’m far more concerned with White law enforcement coming after me for defending myself than I am from a dysfunctional black majority police force.As for the gangs I’ll happily take them over the police, it literally could not be any worse than it now. I don’t see Venezuelan gangs taking kids away to mutilate their sexual organs on behalf of jews &amp; White liberals. They may murder random people but that was already happening &amp; cosigned by the White staffed police already.Based on what you’ve said I have to assume that you think brown unity is the real deal &amp; that the deliberate ethnic cleansing that’s still to this day occurring in California is a one off. The jew bloomberg would disagree with you since he openly admitted to flooding new york with hispanics to push blacks out to lower the crime rate &amp; argued that should be the blueprint for every black crime ridden city.Reading the rest of what your post you seem to think that there’s a preternatural ability for these people to genocide us &amp; if you’re right then I guess we should just pack it up now.How many Asians sign up for law enforcement? What are they going to to put a gun to their heads &amp; force them to become beat cops? And how many these asians come here with the explicit intent to genocide Whites? Hell even the latinos are only here for the gibs &amp; lawless society it provides them, they didn’t come here because they agreed with jews &amp; White liberals about genociding traditional White people.I find it incredibly laughable that you’re concerned about the monopoly on violence, that’s been under northern liberal control since the end of the civil war &amp; later co-operated by jews. The last century it’s been that White monopoly on violence you so cherish that’s been enforcing the laws designed to cleanse Whites from this country. It wasn’t jews nor blacks nor asians who enforced the brown decision or any other anti White laws at gunpoint upon the White citizenry.We’re the most armed populace on the planet, if tomorrow every pro White person here, and just them alone, took up arms against the state the government would have to either bend the knee or destroy every last inch of the country fighting guerillas. That won’t happen of course because we’re 20 different Euro races who never once got along back when we were living in the European continent scattered across a big country. At least it won’t happen until most of the territory is lost &amp; standards of living drops so low that people are yet again faced with harsh conditions but it’s far more likely they’ll flee much like the competent cubans did after the revolution in their country. That’s already well underway by the way, people across the NATO sphere are already leaving &amp; if you’re right then I expect that migration to increase exponentially.But you’re right about one thing: it’s gonna suck, all of this is going to be very unpleasant &amp; guess what? It’s going to continue to be mostly White people enforcing it even as the foot soldiers on the ground become diverse, just as they have this entire time. The jews &amp; White leftists didn’t personally put a gun every single person’s head &amp; force them to enact White genocide, they did that willingly over the most petty reasons.If I’m wrong &amp; brown people are hyper competent, will maintain an even greater anarcho tyranny &amp; White people will continue to be suicidal cucks even when forced to see the ugly diversity up close &amp; personal then not only is it already a forgone conclusion that it’s over for White Americans but it is also entirely deserved.In fact much of the toll collecting that we’re going to see in the days ahead is entirely deserved. Western Whites will go down in history as the the most destructive people ever to walk this earth, they deliberately bred billions of third world savages by giving them technology they would’ve never developed on their own, started the green revolution &amp; gave the most savage subhumans trillions of dollars in handouts. They let jews get filthy rich in their countries off of usury then acted as their golem to create an empire that has destroyed countless countries all over the world &amp; poisoned land, water &amp; air with chemicals that will linger for centuries- if not longer.If there is cosmic justice in this universe then perhaps it is meant to be that western Whites go the way of the dodo for the immense evil they’ve wrought upon the world. Collectively we are a cancer upon the world, jews always take the blame for everything but none of this was possible without our consent &amp; willingness to enact destructive policies hand in hand with them.I didn’t personally consent to any of that &amp; I did everything in my power to not assist it but I’m just an individual, on a collective level Whites deserve what’s coming to them &amp; then some.Naturally I don’t share your lamentation about the disaster coming for Whites, at least not the vast majority of them who willingly went along with all this while smugly virtue signaling along the way.

            RVIDIXR: “It was funny seeing the new york times wringing their hands about how it’s basically over for blacks in Cali a while back, of course they won’t say why.”I have long felt that the mestizos/castizos likely have an average IQ up around 90/91/92, whereas thekneegr0wzhave an average IQ down around 85/84/83, and that that mere six or seven point difference in IQ is precisely what allows themestizos/castizos to aim a gl0ck, or an AR-f!fteen, sufficiently accurately to ass@ssinate the kneegr0wz, whereas [on average] the kneegr0wz can shoot mountains of ammunition without ever being able to hit any target whatsoever.

        I have long been struck at how they squeal with indignation if anyone is to object to porn on any moral basis whatsoever.  It’s all “consenting adults” and “don’t be repressed” and “women’s empowerment”, etc.  A government that cared for it’s people would never have legalized pornography, onlyfans, etc.  The addiction and simping from those things is far, FAR worse than just discretely going to some whore in real life and getting your rocks off.  At least that is real and is a moment of experience.Capitalism is as deeply atheistic and hostile to God as communism and we are in a profoundly Godless society.  It’s all just dollars and cents and no one is to say that some things are not for sale; namely sexuality, childhood, dignity, people-hood, etc.They scream if morality is applied to any issue.  Those who would try to be moral are deemed more immoral than the vicious sinners.  Those who notice a “migrant” stabbing children are worse than the the child killer and on and on.  Satanic inversion.Demographic separation isn’t enough; I have no use for these white atheist monsters either.

there so much of this type of thing in the west. The idea that well we would like there not to be porn available for 9 year olds, but some principle that overrides it; we would like to live in a homogeneous society but some principle that overrides it; we’d ideally like mothers to stay home with their children but principle .
its like God said you HAVE to do this stuff; it destroys society, it has no precedent or tradition in the west , but God said, so deal with it!

                        This is what confounds people around me when I tell them I am bound for “2nd world” nations. Eastern European countries for instance.There is a decided lack ofeverythingwe take for granted here. A/C, not a thing for most. Amazon? Maybe if you are lucky. Internet? Spotty, Infrastructure? 50/50 Corruption? Probably no worse than the US we just hide it better.But these are creature comforts of the pathetically weak herd here they cannot live without even if they must live in a high crime multi-kulti hellhole globalist shopping mall where they are a hated minority.It is utterly surreal to walk through major metropolitan areas and have to actively look for n-ggers. Yes, I don’t have a Starbucks w/ WiFi on every corner, but neither do I have to dodge violent pavement apes on every corner too.I actively went -searching- through the middle of America 2 summers ago on a long long drive looking for a “Whitopia” city. Surely Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City? Somewhere, right? Wrong! Erased. It is latinos and negros wall to wall even in Midwest America now. I guess I could go to Portland or Seattle but the pozzed out lefties are nearly as intolerable as their pets.For me? It is not even a question, much like your 1974 longing except I don’t require a time machine, just living a less convenient life but surrounded by White People. You could get the same experience in the in-between places in the US too, I realize. But the cities are the part that draws me since ours are totally lost.

                            “Americans” have been deluding into thinking that material plenty is thesummum bonumof human existence. It’s a damned lie. Material culture is perhaps 25% of human life. But in warped and stunted AINO, people rate it close to 100%. Those who buy the lie are leading a mutilated life.

                                Yep, wife and I never discuss the “new car” or the “big house” when discussing the essence/blessings of our happiness.  It’s family, friends, and neighborhood.  This pocket of “utopia” in a sea of troubles seems to me the essence of White hesitancy to react to deteriorating societal conditions we see all around us.  Many of us have already retreated to our “Inner Castle Keeps”.  Of course, as one sees in the movies, such *is* already a last resort before collapse.

                                    I’m in a similar situation. Stable, stress-free jobs that provide sufficent income and then some; good marriage; nice but modest house in a nice, white nabe, in a city without a large population of nuggras. It’s a pretty good gig even though we cannot completely escape the iniquitious impositions of the popular “culture” and our fellow “Americans.” We’ve still got plenty to lose. So much so that I’m not about to do anything rash, although I’m sorely tempted from time to time.

                            Livable cities are the key. I can think of plenty of rural areas of the United States that remain quite livable, but not an actual urban one. As you point out, the NPCs in places like Seattle are just as bad albeit in a different way. You made a smart move.

                    Poorer but much freer. A lot less “stuff” cluttering up their lives, but fewer cops and fewer rules. Fewer services. Stupid shit like Door Dash didn’t exist. More self-reliance. Less government. Almost no foreigners. Everyone spoke English. You weren’t being surveilled 24-7. You weren’t treated as if you were a terrorist. It felt like it was YOUR country — because it was.I can remember as a child my grandmother taking me to the airport to look at the planes, you walked right in and went right up to the loading gate and the airplane was parked on the ramp 20 feet away. No metal detectors. Not a cop in sight.Courthouses and government office buildings didn’t have metal detectors, either. No ID checks. No biometric scans or facial recognition. You could go almost anywhere into a public building. Cops were not trigger-happy and they only had six rounds. They were afraid they’d get jammed up if they shot people. Since they were all men and mostly football goons, more likely they’d just slap the shit out of you if you got out of line or give you the old “hickory shampoo.”I live near the northern border and we used to go to Canada just because we were bored and we wanted to see funny-colored money and gasoline sold in liters. Canadian border guards were unarmed. Usually took about ten seconds to cross the border. Now it’s like Checkpoint Charlie.Stay-at home white moms and white families with 3-6 kids were the norm. Jobs were more secure and had pensions. Kids played outside until sundown. Young people weren’t fat. Most older people weren’t fat either. Girls wanted to fuck guys. Homosexuality was laughed at. Schoolyard fights were common and kids screamed “You fag!” as they beat the hell out of each other. You could drink when you were 18 and if you were 16 it was close enough. Same thing with cigarettes. You could smoke indoors. My high school actually had a smoking lounge for juniors and seniors. Seniors would hit the bar across the street in their varsity jackets at 2:00 for a beer. I visited my older brother’s college while I was in high school and sat in on his classes and the calc professor lit up a smoke and set it on the chalk tray while he wrote equations on the board and then picked it up and blew a couple of smoke rings. That night I got puking drunk at a dorm party. Every college had a bar. If you had fake ID all you got was a lecture if you got busted. Cops would let you slide on a lot of stuff if they knew you weren’t a major criminal.In other words, it was Real Life, not this feminized, Helicopter Mommy/Karen/Nanny State/woke bullshit where you can be ruined for anything you ever said and if the cops or the government get involved in something as simple as a fistfight it becomes a life-destroying crisis of epic proportions.

                True, Stephanie. I was far poorer yet much happier in the Seventies. The cliche about trading liberty for security holds up over time. The embrace of materialism led to a poverty of enjoyment. I’m not even certain how many people now would take an economic hit to avoid diversity among other pathologies. Few, I suspect. Hence grotesque aesthetics and fat asses tucked into designer jeans, to the extent those two things differ.

            It’s crazy how rapidly things have shifted. Just a few years back it still seemed like I was living in a nice White country then one day I blinked &amp; suddenly found myself living in an international airport. Now every time I leave the house I encounter twelve different languages being spoken &amp; see pagan tribals I’d only ever used to see on national geographic documentaries walking around everywhere. That’s just the diversity, most White people I see are now so devolved I’m counting down the days until having a bone shoved through the septum &amp; skin scarification is the new normal.

                Warning signs include that Congressional Record posting in 1962 about Commie plans, and the 16 Year Plan to Destroy America. They were and are not subtle, and rely on a misinformed and uninformed public to succeed.Further back, look at The Long March Through the Institutions, then look at those institutions like higher ed and government to see how disastrously effective that has been.Here are some remedies.Move the federal agencies out of the DC area and closer to the people that they purportedly serve.Open up the Senior Executive Service review and add controls for the Constitutional Executive, i.e., the President to impact it like the other areas.Abolish the Department of EducationToughen up the revolving door between Wall Street and the federal government.Enact transparency in the regulatory process to remove the industry capture of their regulators.Provide criminal penalties for pharmaceutical industry executives that push the phony studies.Put teeth into the budget process and cut off funding to idiocy, with the Trump commission that includes non-captured members like Elon Musk instead of insiders who favor their own and quash outsider objective opinions.A starting point, with variations that readers can add.

                    With all due respect, the time for those ideas has passed. It should have been a centerpiece of the “opposition” party, the GOP, from 1992 onward after the Cold War ended.Instead, we choose continued consolidation in DC (begun under Reagan) of the federal government as a permanent, immovable object with the organs of propaganda (again, thanks Reagan, thanks Bush) at their fingerprints. American “conservatives” voted again and again for the consolidation of power in the military and the police under the control of the executive and legal branches of USGOV.It’s too late. You’re asking a couple on the brink of divorce if they want to move to a different state. One party — the one with the most force at the current moment — says absolutelynoto that idea. That leaves you with the task of finding people who’ll not only do the work of moving those agencies and re-staffing them, but stopping those who will go to DEFCON1 to stop your proposed move. We don’t have the Army, hombre, to do that, and moreover, I don’t want to save this marriage.If we end up with agencies akin to those of FEDGOV in DC, they won’t be part of the current regime, but ours — or someone else’s.

                            Yes, he tried that. Massive resistance by the permanent bureaucracy stalled it until he was out of office.
But another idea, move the Department of Agriculture to where the agriculture is, e.g. Iowa.
Move the Department of Housing and Urban development to an urban area that really needs development, East St. Louis Illinois.
And so on.

                                Here’s a better idea. Get rid of the Department of Agriculture and HUD etc. They do far more damage than good.
Just one example: a lot of comments here note the prevalence of obesity in modern America. USDA has promoted that trend more than any other entity through its pushing of the starch-heavy “Food Pyramid” and the corn-soybean agricultural model. There are thousands more examples.

                        No, it’s certainly not communism. This is 2024, not 1954. That said, there is an ideology–postmodern fascism–that facilitates the anti-white racism. And it has proven to be much more destructive than Marxism ever was, chiefly because it’s much more insidious and abstruse.

                            Possibly, although I don’t think that I’d mind postmodern fascism deployed for the sake of whites.
The problem is that many people resist facing that our fight is racial and prefer to distract themselves and others with useless debates about ideology.
Is it better to fight the racial hostility of our enemies or to fight their ideology?

                                We don’t need the postmodern destruction of standards to justify white chauvinism because white civilization is objectively superior to everything else. But yes, garden-variety fascism deployed on behalf of whites wouldn’t be the worst thing.
And you’re right that white nationalists don’t necessarily need to understand the ideology behind the hatred of whites. Recognizing the hatred exists and is promulgated by almost everybody–including whites–in power should be more than sufficient to get people off their asses and motivated for battle.

It is very sad how degraded our people have become with the pajamas, crocs and tattoos and piercings. The language is degraded. The cussing from people in positions of authority is striking.
Well, we focus on maintaining and increasing our dignity and dressing, acting and thinking like we are the best. We need that mindset of being on the Vanguard.

                    “I don’t have to leave my house. Every ad, every image is a world without us. “Certainly true—but it’s a make believe world.  Take a trip to any non-White country and you’ll find the real world without us.  Hell, everything of a modern era they use—and that’s not always much—was created and is maintained by the (former) White world.  The exception here is Asia, notably China, Japan, Korea—and they fashioned themselves as soon as they could upon the Western world as it was at the time.A world without Whites is indeed to be imagined, but it won’t be pretty and certainly would not exist if we had not been around to create it in the first place.

                    “I don’t have to leave my house.”Its bittersweet this, it is beyond irritating that there is no respite from it no matter where you go or whatever activity you take part in but at the same time it has me militant beyond belief which is no doubt going to be necessary in the days ahead.That stuff has really chipped away at my ability to bite my tongue to the point I just don’t even care what I say in public anymore. For example I got my dentist in trouble during the plandemic for making him reflexively laugh in the lobby in front of several of his other customers when I casually said we should feed looters to woodchippers.Every time I’m forced to see some pavement ape in advertising &amp; the like it inches me that much closer to poking some holes in a white pillow case &amp; grabbing a torch.

                        I hear you RVIDXR. It is irritating. Conquerors do this for a reason. We must be disciplined and as much as I feel the same, bite your tongue. Focus on having your best posture. I tell myself, ‘I am the Lord and Master here.’ I smile comport myself like the Duke and move on. That doesn’t change that we are under seige and frankly, a conquered people. However, The Regime wants us to lose it. It is critical that we do not.As a matter of course, read the histories of our real men who were incredible men. Build a mannerbund and bond together. It is very difficult to channel the perfectly natural feelings that this conquest gives rise to. This is a part of our trial. How do we channels those emotions to move toward the transcendent and toMaster your skills. Master the use of weaponry, not to get revenge, but just to stand up in yourself the confidence of being a true gentleman. That is, be a man who is a man who has the choice to be gentle. This will change you and it will change our people. Master an art and master your skills that make you money. Be the best.I hear you and I feel you. We have been erased and those ads are a premonition, an announcement of what they see for us – annihilation. It isn’t going to happen. Why? Because we are going to restore ourselves and become the smartest, the strongest, the most cultivated, the most emotionally disciplined, the most healthy people once again. Channel those emotions and harness that energy for the betterment of you and your mannerbund and your family that will be large, healthy and happy.Sent with love. Have a great weekend.

                            I hear you &amp; thank you. On one hand I do agree with you but on the other, setting aside my virulent tone in that example, I’ve noticed that making comments like in that example is kind of breaking the miasma of silence about what’s happening.I admit I could certainly have a more composure when I make such comments in public but I do think it’s a good thing overall to bring these things up in a public forum. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve found myself hearing people confess to me that they feel the same way &amp; feel relieved that someone dared to say something.I also think it’s going to be necessary to let the fangs show down the road, the savages we’re surrounded with only understand violence. Americans in the colonial era learned this from their exposure to the psychopathic indians &amp; White criminal gangs. I remember reading about a gang during that time who went around doing horrible things, rape, robbery murder etc but with a penchant for torture. When they were caught the men who hunted them down executed them by slowly sawing their heads off with knives. Back then nobody would dare call those men dishonorable &amp; personally I think they were quite merciful given what they’d done but by today’s standards they’d be considered evil.There’s time &amp; place for civility to be sure but when dealing with feral men you have to speak in their language of extreme violence &amp; anything less becomes immoral in of itself. We’re currently on the extreme end of that right now where the most sadistic scum is coddled &amp; pampered, if given the choice I’d take the opposite extreme every single time without hesitation.But again, I do want to stress you’re right, at this time those energies should be channeled towards betterment of myself, my family &amp; my community. I’m just making the point that there may come a day when that energy be channeled into kinetic warfare &amp; in such instances raw brutality is both moral &amp; necessary.

                                This is great. Yes. I agree with you on saying something in the right company. I do the same.Driving by a public worksite I’ll say something like, “Can you remember the last time you saw a White man working on a job site like this?”Or looking at a billboard, “Isn’t it odd that we’ve been driving for 150 miles on these country roads in an all white state and only see non-whites on the billboards?”Or when a thug with corn rows shows up to your house in a tony enclave to do the pest control work when it used to be a chad White guy, “Wow. It looks like there is a new hiring standard. This isn’t the Orko guy of old.”I find that said that way, that like you people open up and unburden themselves. We live in a Racial Bolshevik police state. Everyone is thinking it, but nobody is saying it.I even did that with a bud who is all in on, “diversity.” I know his father and his upbringing and I think he is all in because he is striving for great wealth. One day on one block we walked by decaying and neglected sign acknowledging the town founding and founders in the early 17th century. On the next block was a brand new mural. It had an astronaut, a doctor, a scientist, a fireman with a vagina, a teacher. It looked like what it is supposed to look like when the town contracts this out to who it is allowed to contract it out to. Total erasure. I said to him, “Man that billboard sure doesn’t look like anyone who founded this in 1621. Not a single person looks like any of your three beautiful children either. They have an interesting future ahead of them.”I was greeted by an uncomfortable laugh.Those are effective entrees in the right company. For quite a while I was going around in a rage and highly reactive to near total erasure in my area – which is very affluent. Then I started the approach I mentioned in my first message and found that it changed me and was sending out the right message and putting everything in its proper place if you understand what I am saying.In any case, these are great conversations to be having. Keep me posted on how becoming the Duke of your County is going and how your mannerbund is edifying you and changing the climate when you guys go out well dressed carrying yourselves with a dignified confidence.Have a great weekend!!

                                    I know that uncomfortable laugh you mentioned very well, my high school was extremely leftist &amp; I just couldn’t help but poke the pig. Constantly got into trouble for it which I didn’t mind but eventually I learned it is infinitely more infuriating to leftists to make comments like yours &amp; ask really pointed questions. I’d routinely get kicked out class but no punishment could really bet met out because I didn’t break any rules, got to the point my ultra leftist teacher had me transferred.The thing that pushed him over the edge was when I said yeah blacks commit disproportionate amounts of rape because of poverty in response to him pooh poohing black crime.Honestly I should count my blessings, we may have diversity being shoved down our throats where I live nothing like that mural. It’s a reminder that I’d rather live in the ghetto where at least there’s no hyper degenerate leftist stuff like that. It could always be worse ya know.But thanks for the reply &amp; well wishes, hope you have a pleasant too &amp; stay safe.

                RVIDXR: “Now every time I leave the house I encounter twelve different languages being spoken &amp; see pagan tribals I’d only ever used to see on national geographic documentaries walking around everywhere.“I remember Pat Buchanan getting dragged through the coals, circa the mid-1990s [???], for having written a column bemoaning the emergence of negroid drummers thumping bongos on the sidewalks of Washington DC.Everything Pat Buchanan stood for was True.Everything his opponents countered with was nothing but Lies.[Buchanan was born in Washington, DC, in 1938, and went to Georgetown for his Bachelor’s, so the topic of DC culture was deeply personal to him.]

                    Pat is one of several canaries in the coal mine that either nobody listened to or were utterly destroyed for publicly reading the writing on the wall. He was probably the last one where something could’ve been done to stave off the worst effects had we listened to him.

                        Like the OG, Cassandras never are believed and tend to be dismissed as kooks. If you review Buchanan’s 1992 speech at the RNC, basically all of it came to fruition yet he was run out of his crappy political party for telling uncomfortable truths. I’m not certain things were fixable even then, so George Wallace circa1968 probably was the last public figure who could have made a difference, which probably explains why he was critically wounded by an assassin a few years later. We know now, of course, that likely was an inside job. Things will have to implode now and the outlines of that are pretty clear.

                Yep, even before CO legalized and set the trend, LEO’s that I spoke to knew the score.  In short they said the move would simply make marijuana a tax avoidance crime. Weed being at that time about half the cost of the new “government” stores.
BTW, don’t forget the many States that still sell alcohol in government stores.

        On the drug racket…I had my hip replaced a couple years ago.  For the first consultation when deciding if a replacement was the right course of treatment, without me asking for it, the doctor, from somewhere in South America, prescribed me the strong, narcotic version of Advil, to treat my “discomfort”.  I never got it filled.After surgery, I was prescribed 6 weeks worth of every narcotic anti-inflammatory and pain killer you can imagine – Percocet, Vicodin, etc.  I stopped taking that stuff after 4 days, didn’t like how I felt on them, and managed any discomfort I had taking Tylenol as needed.The best part is both the surgeon’s office and my insurance company would follow up to see if I was taking all these drugs, and if not, ensuring I was disposing of them properly.  It did cross my mind that I had enough narcotics to fund a couple nice vacations on the black market.Point being, doctors are basically promoters and marketers for big pharma these days.

                Ok ….. Children, of course, but from my vantage point as one who had none until incipient old age, it looks like in large areas of the country, that’s not a high priority.
So that might not cut heavily into sales.
OT &amp; Aside: Out here in the hinterlands of forgotten America where I live, families of 2-4 kids are not unusual.

            We’ll never have robot wives for the same reason we’ll never have flying cars: We’d like them.I don’t remember the company’s name, but the only successful non-Google/Facebook/etc. consumer “AI” company made a specialized chatbot aimed at sympathetic conversation, being your text friend/therapist. When they found out that men were using it as a surrogate wife—afriendly woman—they destroyed the product’s ability to be that, stopped having customers, and congratulated themselves.Every company will do the same. Even the Japanese, under American sway, are trying to abandon the friendly woman genre. Ojisan autism—businessmen not being able to absorbnewirrational rules—prevents it for now. But whenever a new friendly woman comes out, a train station cartoon mascot whose voice is too kind or whatever, their communist party, which has great social power despite holding no offices (familiar?), protests it—more and more successfully. Eventually everyone will bow.This is why so many of our guys love Japanese cartoons and bewail their death by Americanization. We can’t go to the train station and be greeted by the pretty animated girl, but we can watch a show about her. It’s not even good, but it’s thelast thing.

        I was watching The Untouchables TV series some time ago (A quick google says it was “The Troubleshooter” episode) where they have some kind of card system in corner stores for illegal gambling.The Untouchables are outraged that the poor people would be preyed upon with these evil devices (IIRC, these episodes were high on propaganda).  Today scratch lottery tickets are everywhere. They are one of the worst taxes on the poor and low IQ Americans.  Lotteries are by far the worst way to gamble with a very high take.  Even the slots are a better risk.  Casinos generally take about 10%. The lottos take 50% and I believe the scratch tickets are even higher.The illegal numbers today are a much better gamble.  The lottery claims they use the proceeds to benefit seniors.  That is a laughable lie.

                They pulled that crap In Philadelphia.  They rammed through a “soda” tax (applies to nearly all drinkable liquids) of 2 cents per oz which is then taxed by both the city 2% and the state 6% (a 64oz bottle has an extra 1.39 added) to supposedly benefit the keeds and da skools.  It was all about the childrens until it passed.  The second that “soda” tax passed, it was rolled into the general budget where diverse people could steal it.I know a few public school teachers in Philadelphia and they are expected to supply their own supplies and supplies for the keeds.  Of course, the Board of Education downtown has a parking lot full of beamers and benzes!  Times are always good at the BOE. There are never any budget cuts at the BOE.

            Gambling is a tax on the stupid.
I once bought a lottery ticket when paying for my gasoline and was shocked … SHOCKED !!! when I learned that I hadn’t won the $64,000,000 prize that was advertised in the red neon sign above the counter.
Never again!

        Haven’t listened yet, but wondering if you bring up Back to the Future 2.  The bad timeline where Biff takes the sports almanac is arguably better than the world we are living in now.  I don’t remember them including pot shops all over town in the movie. Having a society worse than a Hollywood send up of vice from the 1980s isn’t exactly a positive sign.

            Speaking of signs…Hollywood’s idea of a dystopian hell—not updated in decades, so it’s still the same in new TV and video games—is clean streets, blond men in suits, women who aren’t fat, and…art deco signs. The Jaws billboard that attacks us in Back to the Future 2 is a technologically exaggerated art deco theater sign, the past but more so, the “ocean liner style” via the Hollywood id.The famous (in death) liquor store in Minneapolis that was burned down in 2020, now having its postmortem pictures passed around again because of Walz, was a heritage/protected building (local equivalent) because of its (almost)style paquebotexterior. Looting the corner liquor store is traditional, but it wasn’t the most obvious or convenient target for a photogenic arson that day. Media-trained mob is media-trained.I don’t hang out there but I assume the “statue Twitter” guys have noted that art deco was peak whiteness, posted some pinup girls leaning on Studebakers (not gay!), maybe even noticed that Walz doesn’t signifydown-home football coach etc.at all, but that one heavily symbolic business sign in flames. It’s the only job America has seen him do.

        12:00 The guys who are really profiteering off theft is the cops.  The cops steal billions of Dollars year in year out.  They literally rob people on the side of the road and in airports.  It is now de facto illegal to carry money.  This has been going on for quite a long time.  I drove to Disney World in 1995 and people I worked with and knew (none of whom were criminals) all said not to carry money on 95.  They said cops pulled over out of state plates and searched the car and stole your money, which of course is true.  The worst part is they aren’t corrupt.  They aren’t pocketing your money in the hopes you are a criminal and won’t report it.  They give you a receipt.  They steal it on behalf of the state.  They reverse the burden of proof.  Even bank receipts will not help.  Once they steal it, you will never see a dime of it again.  There are no black letter laws against carrying cash.They do it in the airports.  Again, there are no laws against carrying cash in any amount so long as your flight is domestic (there are black letter laws travel out of the country with cash). But try traveling with cash on an airplane. They will steal it.  This is not large amounts of cash nor it is limited to cash. They steal MO and cashier’s checks too.  The average seizure of cash is like 200 bucks.

            The “tell” is in that such official “crime” is *easily* cured with a few changes to the law.1) No Local, State, or Federal agency may “profit” from such seizure. All such monies must revert to the US Treasury. (This kills incentive.)2) No seizure can be made in lieu of a criminal *conviction* for a crime. If there is no criminal indictment, the money plus interest must be returned. Similarly, upon a trial and innocent verdict, all monies seized plus interest must be returned to plaintiff. (This kills random search and seizure.)3) Upon an illegal seizure finding, the State pays the legal costs of the plaintiff. (This evens the legal “playing field”.)Some of these recommendations are being implemented at the State level, but really, it’s not enough, soon enough. The Federal law enacted in the bad old days of the drug epidemic needs elimination.

                The problem is they do profit sharing.  The cops steal the money on behalf of the feds and then the feds kick back 1/2 of it.  A judge even threatened to have everyone involved thrown in prison on contempt if they didn’t return the money.  The state actors told the court “we cannot return the money because we gave it to the feds”  The judge was bluffing. Nobody went to jail and the guy, even with his court order, still doesn’t have his money.There is another theft type the state does called home equity theft.  A bunch of US states allow a municipality to take your house and sell it to recover unpaid taxes and fines.  But if they confiscate your house and sell it, they are supposed to pay you the excess it sold for after they pay themselves what they decided you owe them.But in many US states, they take your house, sell it, pay themselves out of the proceeds and then keep the rest.  There are cases where hundreds of dollars were owed, they confiscated the property sold the house for hundreds of thousands, paid themselves the hundreds of Dollars and kept the rest.  Even after one of the state supreme courts (Michigan) supposedly fixed this, they refuse to stop doing it.Most of the states now sell your data through DMV.  You are required to have either a license or a state issued non-license. You cannot enter any state buildings without having one.  They force you to get their ID and then they sell any information about you they collected while forcing you to get the ID.  They probably sell information about what car you drive too.  Given you cannot drive 10 miles in most of the US without being read by an automated license plate reader, they probably sell your travel habits as well.This kind of corruption simply cannot be fixed. No reforms will ever stop it. No court orders will ever stop it.

                        Fair enough.  I just figure they can jew their way right through any such rules.  I just don’t believe you can rule-nazi them into compliance.  You have to remember some lawyer just tried to sue Geico because Geico’s client gave some woman the clap in the back of his car.  If you can twist car insurance into catching the clap in the back seat, is it really that much of a stretch to think they cannot (at least try to) get around your rules?  They don’t see rules the way we see them.  While wee see the rules as guidelines to our behavior, they see them as obstacles to be overcome.

        Way, way back in the olden times, when I was a wee youth, I actually came to know a real mobster (friend of the family, you might say). His name was Frank Olivo and he weighed about 350 pounds and drove a Hudson sedan. And yes, he had a trademark Fedora and smoked cigars religiously. He was a bagman for the mob and made rounds a few days each week, and otherwise played the ponies. And he was a nice guy who enjoyed dispensing ancient wisdom via parables. He was simple man who did his job reliably and enjoyed life without any fanfare or sense of guilt. And he was a better man than Joe Biden and Lyndsey Graham will ever be.

            Back in the mid-90s I used to work in a dry cleaners. One of the guys I worked with was named Benny Chavez. We got along good and became pals, after a fashion. One day, we’re going about our quotidian routine, shootin’ the bull, and he up and tells me he killed a guy back when he was in his early 20s. I was totally shocked and taken aback. Asked him why he did it. He just said it was drug related. At any rate, the Benny I knew was a knock-around kind of a guy, and one of the very funniest people I’ve ever known. Working alongside Benny was a laff riot. But man, you just never really know.

            It’s a new world. GAE can no longer push around any decent-sized country or, even, a militia. Satellites tell you where any military force is located. Missiles and drones can hit them or you can ambush them if it’s a small force like what the IDF and Americans sent to hit the Houthi.Our carrier groups are terrified of getting hit and thus stay far away from danger. They no longer project power to anyone with a decent missile system. NATO would be lucky to muster 60k to 90k troops in a year, a joke of a force against Russia, China or, even, Iran – and that’s assuming the other side just let you organize this force unfettered, which it wouldn’t.Militarily, we’re already in a multi-polar world. The US and Israel just have figured it out yet. The only real weapon that the US has left is the dollar, and the BRICs are working hard to reduce (though not eliminate) its power.In a decade or so, the US will be reduced to a regional military and economic power. I don’t think that our rulers truly understand this.

                The problem will be our rulers don’t and can’t accept the greatly diminished sphere of influence. The GAE is simply following the normal arc: the periphery erodes and the ability to project power continues to shrink until it is more or less only the old capitol and immediate countryside that can be ruled somewhat competently. With the preface I don’t relish the eventuality, if the region you reference is North and South America, those increasingly will be aligned with China and Russia and perhaps even Iran and some will host their military bases. A trait of dying empires also is state violence and oppression. I would note that in the final few years of the Ottoman Empire that the long-craved genocide of the Greek minority was realized. I can see something happening here along those lines, and Southerners in particular would be well-advised to elect governors who will develop state weapons of mass destruction systems in anticipation of that day of score-settling.

        As a Christian, I believe all forms of fornication, including porn, will damn one’s everlasting soul to Hell. The NT makes clear that even divorce and remarriage is sexual immorality, and will bring about that same woeful end.In a perfect world, I don’t wantanyoneto participate in these things, knowing that they who do such will suffer the wrath of God if they do not repent.However, I would like to see prostitution legalized. The Guv Gang absolutely uses sex, one of Mankind’s most primal urges, as a weapon against a healthy, functioning society. Legal prostitution would break the back of the Feminist she-Beast overnight. It appears certain that removing sex as a bargaining chip would create a genuine opportunity to repeal the 19th.The Guv Gang uses the hocus pocus of Law to protect all manner of pornographic materials, going so far as to disseminate porno books into our public school libraries. We live in an open air brothel, but any attempt by the Regular Guy to obtain actual sex is met with destruction of his life and livelihood.Making prostitution illegal does nothing to promote moral or public health, while the existing laws are a cudgel with which to crush the skull of hapless men who have been stripped of their ability to marry by a plethora of bad effects of feminist dogma and the collapse of all restraints on female nature (which dogma and elimination of restraint is enforced by the guns of Uncle Sugar, natch).Set us free and put our Kicks back in the private sector.

        Gotta say the idea that Rent-A-Center has a DEI department, which it in fact probably does, made me laugh aloud for a while. Lots of hilarious stuff in that show. As for government-run prostitution, that depends on how widely you define prostitution. If Kamala deepthroats her way to the top, wouldn’t she be Exhibit A?

        I think porn is prostitution – dual prostitution. Two people are getting paid to have sex to arouse anonymous voyeurs. It is a disturbing thought. Who owns that racket? Don’t some religious leaders own it? That is what I have heard.
In any case, things have deteriorated and that process accelerates.
On the flip side, it has never been a better to cultivate virtue with the access to knowledge. We just have to form networks differently to practice it in fellowship. That is the path forward for our folk.

            I’ve never been able to wrap my head around the legal “reasoning” that says that video of people copulating is “speech.” If it was a recording of them talking dirty to each other, I could better comprehend.
Anyhow, you are correct. It is prostitution made legal, so long as the act is recorded and disseminated somehow. It is only when you try to keep your solicitation of prostitution secret that it becomes illegal.

                Screwing as speech is all part of the postmodern destruction of language. Since the meaning of language is merely a matter of perspective, words mean whatever the people in power say they mean. Another example is the redefinition of “vaccine.”

            The concept of legalized prostitution is somewhat overblown.  Why?  The typical female today at a young age, but surely after dating age, considers sex the equivalent of what was a good night kiss in the 50’s and 60’s.  In short, there’s quite a bit of legal competition to paid for sex.  Yeah, the incels probably could use a bit of help here, but sex is rampant within the population at an early age with few strings attached.Since it is Olympics time, just Google some of the stories of the Olympic villages and the accommodations made to facilitate the endless sex these athletes enjoy after their events.  Condums, STD tests, all sorts of things provided.  Amazing.I became aware of this sea change in university many years ago.  I took a (first) date back to her home, yes, parents home.  She turned after a goodnight kiss at the door, reached into her purse, pulled out a closed hand.  Then she turned to me, opened her hand, and asked me if I’d like to come in.  In her then opened hand was a condum and a hand rolled pot cigarette.  First date—and believe me, I’m no Charlie Sheen type.Now is the part where you expect me to say something cute like, “Those were the good old days.”  Bullshit.  That was the beginning of the end of a decent and ordered society, I was just too stupid to recognize it at that time.

                    To be fair, I’m no “bluenose”.  The problem is not so much “sex before marriage”, but “so much sex before marriage”.  There is much study of the effect of meaningless sex on a woman’s ability to pair bond with a single man.  “Body count” matters—and much more so for women.  Guys think with their “dicks” as it is said, but really they are just fooling themselves to play that game.  Father’s need to step in and early in these matters.  We are not, nor should not, be held to the standard of barnyard animals.

                My general impression is that many of these “actresses” do this quite early in their careers to get a part, any part, in a feature length movie.  There are few who are fortunate enough to build a reputation quickly and can reject those parts, which most often are simply nudity for the sake of titillation—not story telling.
The irony of the whole damn business is that actresses are therefore used and discarded very quickly compared to their male counterparts as no one stays young, novel, and sexually alluring forever.

                    This process goes on in Hollywood, too. The world is full of pretty young girls who would do literally anything to become a movie star. The producers know this and take advantage to the hilt.
Listen to “The King of Hollywood” by Eagles. It describes this dynamic very well.
At any rate, can’t shed too many tears for the bimbos. If they choose that life then they can live with the consequences. There’s other ways to live besides prostituting yourself onto the silver screen.

AFAIC, they’re pretty low on the ol’ victim totem pole. They conducted a transaction and it paid off handsomely for them. Now they want their cake–movie stardom–and to eat it, too–be a victim.

        Speaking of the Mafia, “And so it begins …” the UK’s Metro Police Commissioner Mark Rowley is threatening to extradite American citizens over things they post on any site, social media, this website, anywhere. He explicitly included Elon Musk.Musk first of course, the Biden WH wants him just gone, and did right after they won in 2020. [Musk was the mark in that relationship].The real endgame is Trump. Trump says something, posts something, the UK under Starmer requests the Justice Dept. extradite Trump, they do, Trump is under arrest in the UK and sentenced immediately to the slammer for ten years. Game over. That is the plan.[Related, the UK is now blocking American IPs on their internet because people with VPNs and actual Americans are flooding police dept. websites with phony “racism” accusations like with Scotland’s mis-gendering laws that it takes up their time chasing down actual White people.]

                You’ll have plenty of time I suspect because the fix to SS is not simply to raise age requirement. Much larger than that for kicking the can down the road. A large redo will bring in many parties and that will require a lot of deals. You’ll hear about it as the sides “argue” their positions.
The good news is that a majority of the shortfall is due to the “bulge” in the Anaconda—“Boomers”, and they are slated to die off in the next 20 years. I predict no deal until we approach 2030.

        The Olympics having women’s sports let alone women’s beach volley ball is a sign of a low people. A people that have said as a group, inwardly, we give up.

                And that torqued off the feministas to no end. Consequently, I think all female beach volleyball players are now required to wear burlap sacks and arctic parkas.

        Musk should be in prison.  He’s not just a con artist, he kills people. He uses the highways of America to beta test his awful “full self driving” software.  It isn’t just his dumb customers who get killed.Speaking of Bunco, nobody uses the words prostitute or prostitution anymore.   These words have been superseded by “sex work” and “sex worker”Imagine an article in a mainstream paper titled “How to get Started in Your New Life as a Prostitute”  It just sounds too bad. But replace prostitute with “Sex Worker” and you are well on your way to respectability.  Stupid people aren’t stupid, they’re learning disabled.  Retarded people don’t even exist anymore.The war on reality through language manipulation is in high gear and has been for many years.  I’m surprised our side doesn’t talk about this more.  We are absolutely drenched in this stuff.  They use these word games to make bad stuff sound respectable and good stuff sound wretched.

            Stop associating Musk with hands off driving.  He is perhaps one of 3 or 4 doing such research in the US and many of the accidents are not of his division.  Blame the States and their regulatory system wrt driverless vehicles.
The EV I bought from Ford came with this.  The system is arguable worse than on Tesla, in that it requires *no* hands on wheel.  Tesla at least used technology to sense every so often if you were touching the steering wheel.

                    Yeah, but Ford hands free was a hoot…. Wife and I took our cars to kids house along the highway.  She to stay over, me to leave in afternoon.  She drove along side me for a stretch to pass.  I switched to hands off and rolled the windows down.  Started to honk the horn to grab attention then leaned out of drivers side with both hands waving franticly with eyes closed.
She was not amused.  Nor it seems others on the road.  Some people have no sense of humor….  Never got to pretend to sleep.

It seems the corruption peak has been met and is now on a downward slope of chaos and clawing to hang on. The peak was probably met when Epstein exploded onto the scene. No going back from that.

        When I was born the world was a far simpler place. It was all just cops and robbers. But it wasn’t for me. Then came the Summer of Love. Hashish and LSD arrived on the scene. There were villains locked away for twelve years for robbing a bank of ten grand, doing time with drippy hippies down six months for smuggling two million quid worth of puff. I mean work it out mate. We’re in the wrong f*cking game. Drugs. Changed. Everything.Always remember that one day all this drug monkey business will all be legal. They won’t leave it to people like me. Not once they figure out how much money is in it. Not millions. F*cking BILLIONS. Recreational Drugs PLC: “Giving People What They Want.” Good times today, stupor tomorrow. But this is now. So while prohibition lasts, make hay while the sun shines.I’m not a gangster. I’m a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine. I mean ten years ago a bit of charlie was for pop stars or a celebrities birthday bash. It was demonized by Daily Mail readers getting drunk in naff wine bars. Now they’re my biggest clients.This is Clarkie. Double first at Cambridge in industrial chemistry. Only he’s got to pay off his student loans somehow. Today I only deal in kilos. And, depending on which tariff you use will cost you 28 grand, or fifteen years in prison. Which is more than a rapist. C’est la vie.It is vital that we work to a few golden rules: Always works in small teams. Keep a low profile. Never deal with anyone who doesn’t come recommended. I mean it’s like selling anything: washing machines, hand made rugs, blow jobs…as long as you don’t take the piss people will always come back for more. And that’s not to say that we don’t have that special kind of magic that turns two kilos into three. But never get too greedy.Know and respect your enemy! It is only very very stupid people who think the law is stupid. And avoid like the plague, loud attention seeking wannabe gangsters who are in it for the glory, to be a face, to be a name. They don’t mean to f*ck up. They just do.Oh, and forgive me for stating the obvious, but stay away from the end user. They’re guaranteed to bring you trouble. As do guns. I hate guns. And violence. But, as some Roman general once said. If you want peace, prepare for war. Morty, and his assistant Terry watch my back. Morty learned to be cautious the hard way. He did ten years inside. He’s my bridge to the criminal world. And he insures that the traffic is one way….— XXXX, “Layer Cake”

        When you sign up to read an internet news piece, say, or sone other website to buy a product.  And they require a username and password.who thinks these companies are selling your passwords ?    Knowing that most people use the same password for something like Etsy as they do for their banks.I have to wonder.as an aside.  I have a certain Chase credit card.  And I rarely use it but lately when I did I got spam push notifications and emails that I needed to contact them due to fraud protection. But that was all bogus.  Meaning some scammer has tapped into my Chase card account and is pretending to be them.

        Neither the Z Man or any of the commenters seem to come out and say what all this is pointing to, which is that the State is no more and no less than a criminal gang, and always has been. It’s merely the gang that manages to gain power and hold on to it. It then claims a monopoly on violence, and builds a supporting mythology about its divine right to rule, while continually cementing and growing its power. It uses and rewards collaborators to maintain the mythology and identity and punish dissenters.That’s why its actions resemble those of a mafia. It’s simply the most successful mafia, with its own made men who are protected from the consequences of their depredations.

            The incursion of Ukraine has already been stopped.  All that this “Hail Mary pass” has done is to increase the power of Putin’s hard liners wrt Ukrainian conflict.  Look for “big arrow” advances now to Odessa, hell maybe even Kiev.
