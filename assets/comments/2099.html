        Tocqueville-
Equality of conditions persuades men to conceive an instinctive disbelief in the supernatural and a very lofty, often very exaggerated, conception of human reason.Human opinions form only a sort of intellectual dust which swirls in every direction, unable to settle or find stability.
Man alone of all created beings shows a natural disgust for existence and an immense longing to exist; he despises life and fears annihilation.

        You’ll find this Joseph Bottum essay interesting:“…think of environmentalism. It is commonplace among conservative commentators to point out the ways in which environmentalism sometimes acts as though it were a religion, rather than a political or social view. But few of those commentators pursue the thought down to the actual worldview, which is almost definitively the Church of Christ without Christ.This is a Christian story, a supernaturally charged history that would have been familiar to Augustine and Anselm. We have an Eden, a paradise of nature, until the fall, which was the emergence of sentient human beings as polluters, injuring the world as the world was meant to be. We have a long era of progressive damage, all aiming toward the apocalypse – the final injuring of the world beyond repair. Strong environmentalism offers, in essence, St. Augustine’s dark worldview without any grace or redemption for human beings. Environmentalism offers, in essence, Christianity without Christ.The real question, of course, is how and why this happened. How and why politics became a mode of spiritual redemption for nearly everyone in America, but especially for the college-educated upper-middle class, who are probably best understood not as the elite, but as the elect, people who know themselves as good, as relieved of their spiritual anxieties by their attitudes toward social problems.”http://www.american.com/archive/2014/february/the-post-protestant-ethic-and-spirit-of-america

            That’s an interesting piece. Early Progressives were greatly informed by their Christianity. They saw their politics as an extension of their spiritual life. But, a man who chases two rabbits catches none and they soon drop Christianity.
