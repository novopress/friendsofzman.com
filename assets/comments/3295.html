        I travel quite a bit and have been stopped many times for no reason other than to be searched. The cops always say the exact same words: “Do you mind if I search your car?” That line must work on almost everybody since every damned one of them gets confused when I refuse to consent to the search.

        Either South Australian police are so clean that pinching some booze and laptops from drug-dealers is a massive no-no or the guys that are investigated have not been handing along their piece of the action.

        “It showed that the motorists were detained for a violation they did not commit — a failure to signal during a lane change — and authorities were compelled to return 90 percent of the money.”
This is outrageous. No crime committed–as if changing lanes without signalling could be a crime–and they lose ten grand?  There has to be more to the story but whatever happened to “fruit of the poisonous tree?”

        So much of policing today revolves around stopping people in their cars. I guess it’s a relatively safe and effortless way to make a buck.
I haven’t been a big fan of the notion of driver-less cars, but they might have an interesting side effect. Presuming that driver-less cars are built to adhere strictly to the rules of the road, police forces may find their cash-cow gutted.

        Re: the prettification of mundane job descriptions.  My favourite takedown of this trend was something I read long ago:  “A garbage man will smell the same, though we pass a law requiring us to call him Philosopher King.”

        I got my drivers license in 1958. I do a lot of driving in the mid-Atlantic region. Back roads are my favorite, but some trips require toll roads and interstates.Equipped with a performance enhanced HEMI powered pickup truck, the most reliable radar/laser detector and millions of miles under my belt, I haven’t had a traffic stop in decades.Until…three weeks ago traveling East around Carlyle on the Pennsylvania Turnpike I was nabbed. The trooper approached the driver’s window and said: “Sir, this stop is being recorded on audio and video. The speed limit is 70, you were going 86. Can I have your license and registration?” I handed over the documents and he returned to his car.About five minutes later he appeared at the window and said. “This is not a traffic citation, there will be no points on your license. This(holding up a sheet of paper printed out in his car) is a violation of vehicle codes blah-blah, and blah.”The fine was $25.00, the added costs brought the total up to $127.00. So there you have it. No points, no problem, no reason to get excited. Just pay-up, shut-up and be on your way. It’s all about the money. The nicest mugging a guy could ask for.

            PA is outlandish with the fees. I got hit the same way years back. They had a group of trainees running a radar trap at the bottom of a hill. They pulled over at least twenty cars while I was getting my $150 warning. It is highway robbery.
