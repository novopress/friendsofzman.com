        The problem with dispensing with kings is that there has to be a suitably acceptable new king waiting. One of the recurring issues in British history is that while there were no shortage of claimants to the throne, few of them had what it took to grab the crown and hold it. Some of them were too small to even climb up on the throne unaided. That, essentially, is the whole plot of Game Of Thrones: lots of people fancying a crack at being top dog but unable to either rally enough support or stay alive long enough.Today the new kings of Europe (or in Merkel’s case, the Empress) is that all they do is loudly proclaimed for humanity and democracy. In turn that means they can rally enough brain-lacking troops to support them (these are usually left wingers who are traditionally in the “light thinking” battalions) who will march to show their love for both the Empress and the invaders — even though a little contemplation would tell them the first thing the invaders will get rid of is the Empress, and then democracy will follow. The massed troops of socialism are fighting for their own defeat, though like the Forlorn Hope they don’t really expect to get through to the other side. It’s just a glorious way to go by feeling good about self-sacrifice.Successful old kings (and queens) tended to give the people enough of what they wanted to stay in charge. The curiosity is that today’s rulers seem oblivious to what the people want. “Let them eat halal” might sound good round the polished banqueting table but outside, the peasants are finding they don’t like the taste as much as expected.

        Our system of “killing the King”, impeachment, was abandoned long ago when that effort failed with Big Dog Clinton.If the Republican “leadership” had had the balls to a) make the case to the public without fear of the media and the democrats and b) then continue to see it through to the end we could have easily gotten rid of him.Barry Hussein then would have never would have made it to first base with the public as a presidential candidate. The Dems would have feared the American people too much.That cowardice allowed the first truly America-hating blowhard into 1600 Penn Ave.It will take decades to undo (or simply mitigate) the havoc he has unleashed upon us and the planet, all because of feckless Republicans.At the very least Trump will give us a chance.

        Well. That is most certainly true.It’s either the king or you.My vote is for you.BTW: This orchestrated mass invasion of armies of hostiles goes a magnitude beyond measuring what King James II did to England in his three short years (1685-1688).And he got away with his head intact.There is nothing in this current situation that leads me to believe the outcome for Merkel et al will be as benign as was James’.And frankly — I truly hope and even pray that the cabal meet their end in the most gruesome manner devised by legal authority.

        What is surprising to me is how many people who should see the situation for what it is, are completely blind.  They aren’t stupid…well…they do all right in class, but real life is beyond them.  They are the real problem, they support the rotten system that is about to come crashing down on their heads.   I work hard to hide my disgust for them.  Karl is a perfect example of this type of person.

        “Then the king went crazy and flung open the doors to Muslim invaders.”
It really is the only explanation that makes sense.

        […] for fear the Muslims may rape them or simply go crazy seeing an uncovered female head, the mad king is no longer a man for whom you will pledge allegiance. When the king cancels the “March Against Fear” out of fear of offending the invaders, it’s hard to love the king. Instead, you start thinking it is time to kill the king. It’s either him, or you, no matter what comes next. – – Killing the King […]

            No problem. I stopped following you on twitter and dropped your site from the list. That way, no one I know, including me, will be tempted to use anything you post.
