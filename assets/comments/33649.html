            The Blue Haired Spinsters would serve as a warning to young girls about what happens to you as a woman when you become a shrieking, spiteful blue haired woman with tattoos and piercings.

                        Which is why we need taboos.  We protected young people from themselves with social prohibitions of bad behavior and it worked for 95% of people.  You can never eliminate all of the harm, but you can get pretty close.  Anything has to be better than what we have now which elevates the bad people who are held up as heroes and role models.  Just look at all the puff pieces in the press about the whore of the week on onlyfans.

                            It’s the Satanic inversion. Transfigure deviants, Africans and gluttons (broadly conceived), and anathematize normalcy, whiteness and austerity. I think we have also referred to it as The Great Derangement and Clown World.

                        Among whites, we can safely assume tranny jab rates are 100%. Lesbians, definitely greater than 90%. Homo men, probably not as high as those two, but I bet it’s pushing 90 if not reaching it.
Negros of course don’t take the jab so much, and I couldn’t guess if their jab numbers are greater among sexual deviants

        It was never an ideology. It was always a pretext to usurp control. Even from the outset it was a mask upon which someone could stand up a racket. By the late 50s the thing was already hopelessly corrupt. It chose to liquidate its own people, as empires are inclined to do. The Bolsheviks, the ones in charge, weren’t ideological. They knew it was a means to the end they sought – to usurp the last real monarchy in Europe and replace the nobility and put themselves in charge. It wasn’t ideology that shot the Czar’s entire family in the basement, it was cold and ruthless human primate savagery. That was the willful, total and utter destruction of a family line, a tribe to ensure it never breathed life again.We need to get it through our thick skulls that underneath it all, this is what animates it. It is we who are ideological and have been thoroughly used and manipulated for the purposes of our dispossession. Ultimately, the plan is for all of us to be dragged to that basement and extinguished.Anti-racism and anti-Whiteness are just the socialized veneer to sneak the savages into the gates. Never forget this. This is civilization and those who build it versus savagery and those who destroy it.Our work has only just begun.

            I’m not going to say that every Bolshevik was a true believer, but it is obviously an ideology and worldview. It is why it was so easy for their intellectual brethren to adopt the concepts to other countries (even Bolshevism was a modification, as Russia was not industrialized in the way that Marx perceived), other cultures (China, which was not industrialized at all), and other perceived fault lines in society (gender, race, sexuality, etc.). It’s also obvious today that you can look at the other side of the aisle and see plenty of cynical power-seekers but you also see plenty of true believers.

                    Oswald Mosley understood this.  He was of course not a communist, but he railed against the global-cap system that thru low wages, 3rd world labor, and other unchecked abuses essentially drove the masses to become communists.  Nat-Soc was the 3rd way that was crushed.

                Quite. And given the supposed non-ideological nature of our society, there sure have been a shitpile of manifestoes, tracts and broadsheets published, all in support of some ideology.

            One can illustrate early 1920’s Soviet history with a little skit with 2 characters: communist jew and communist goy.communist goy: “Brother fraternal communist jew, can you please stop mass murdering people for five freaking minutes so we can build our communist utopia?!!??!”commnist jew: “No. It is necessary.”communist goy: “Necessary for WHAT?! All the capitalists are dead or in Paris, London, and New York.”communist jew: *silence*######Communist jews were about 80% of the early ruling class (those making civilizational architectural decisions). Eventually the communist goy had to shoot the communist jews to end the worst of the insanity. Not all the jews, but the ones with the propensity for mass murder (and there were many). The rest were distrusted and hence was born the first jewish homeland (long before 1948 Israel), an autonomous oblast just for them which not coincidently was at the ass end of Siberia abutting the Chinese border. Why there? Because the communist goy wanted them as far away as possible from the civilizational control centers of Leningrad and Moscow.It didn’t work, of course. One can categorize humanity into two parts, those who will leave reciprocating others alone, and those who will not. Most jews are in the latter category. A few who were in the first category moved to their new oblast, but most stayed in place, joined the communist party and played the long game to infiltrate the control nodes of Soviet civilization for the benefit of their tribe. It’s why they took over Ukraine so easily in 1991, because they had already been substantively running it when it was the Ukrainian SSR.

            The Puritans who dominated New England were mainly concerned with looking down their noses at every other group and claiming moral superiority…that’s why the anti-slavery crusade prospered there, but not in the rest of the country…Of course, New England’s sea captains and financiers profited greatly from the slave trade, but that was ignored….

        The blue haired spinsters are a real problem. The only advice I have is do not encourage them to breed! Likely a strong genetic component to their insanity.  And they make fruit loop moms that do damage to kids.  I’ve known guys raised by wacky liberal moms. Not good.

                If you haven’t previously read about the Shakers do so. Instead of the weird dancing of yore to obtain release, the Teal Hair of today scream and rage. Orgasm will be achieved by any means necessary and at any cost necessary and so it goes. Better this way to bliss rather than by spawning new devils to haunt us in the future. BLM has to be viewed as an orgy of the fully clothed and unattractive, and since it did not produce offspring, it was not totally negative in that narrow regard.

        “The result of the long journey is the understanding that there is no universal morality and no universal truth, other than the truth of the human condition. The purpose of human organization is not to transcend the human condition, but to improve our material existence, so that we can enjoy the time each of us is allotted to the fullest we desire.”
That sounds like nightmare fuel. Materialist societies have been tried. When you ask proponents about them, you are usually told they “just haven’t been done right yet.”

            Agreed.
And that is why the Bible and Christianity formed up the way it did. It’s authors understood the human condition and devised a User’s Manual for humanity. The fact that most churches run counter to it today notwithstanding.
And no, Christianity did not put harridans in place to make you eat your veggies and act like a human. When confronted by contentious women – they were dealt with. They got stoned, hanged, burned, and probably even fired out of canons and catapults.
When Old Scratch attacks us – he goes through the women first.

            That’s been a fear of mine too as it sounds like a recipe for Chinese-style society and government from now until when the sun burns out.  (And don’t count on lethargy to save us as the Chinese have been running pretty much the same system for 2000+ years).

            Non-materialist societies have been tried. When you ask proponents about them, you are usually told they “just haven’t been done right yet.
Human societies are fallible by nature because they are populated by humans, it’s not something unique to the 20th century’s experiments with rationalistic and atheistic social structures.

            Agree, tho I think I understand what Z intended. Fine as far as it goes but isn’t an ultimate purpose, certainly.
For me, the purpose of complex human organization (like my church, or the net) is better to serve and glorify God the Father. Then everybody wins, including my nation.

            I found that assertion was confronting as well. It may be true to a degree that there is no comprehensive universal morality but a spiritual aspiration to transcend the material, even momentarily, seems to be a timeless universal. Also war, I have found no contradictions or convincing counter arguments to the proposition that waging war is a fundamental universal characteristic. There always has been and always will be something irreconcilable to contend about and the timeless and universal method of establishing a resolution to that contention is war.

            Yeah, i disagree with Z’s closing thought as well.  A proper civilization of course should ensure the practical like security and abundance.  But it should also inculcate proper, natural, and noble values so the people are not degenerate sinners, addicts, and rootless fools.  It can’t just be about “individualism” or “free markets.”

            Aristotle in I think the Politics wrote that the city (polis) comes into being for the sake of mere life but exists for the sake of the good life.  Of course our host knows this.  The material is essential but not sufficient.  Man does not live by bread alone.  But – while the elements of mere life are relatively straightforward – what is “the good life”?  That question is political philosophy.Our modern problem is that mere life has become so easy that in all our philosophizing (or as Aristophanes might call it, ridiculous gassing on) we have forgotten  that the point of political philosophy is not, in our hosts words, to “transcend the human condition” but just to make the best of it, under the inevitable material constraints of biology, climate, past events, what have you.I’d bet that the Z-man was educated, very well, by Jesuits, partly because I myself was educated, very expensively, by Straussians.

        Any Christian who follows your writings will be very familiar with these Bible passages which describe people’s behavior in the end times. These pretty well sum up the world around us starting with world leadership right down to what we see proliferating in our schools.For Christians the writing is on the wall.2 Timothy 3:1-17But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.2 Timothy 4:3-4For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.

                There was a huge cultish following around 1000 AD, the end of the 1000 years. This got moved to 1033, the 1000 years after the crucifixion. Then 1070, the destruction of the temple. Somewhere along the line, they had a 1000 year marking the date that John had the revelation. I don’t remember the date of that. Been a hot minute since I was in college.
And then the Millennialists simmered on the back burner, waiting for any excuse.

                    Read the case of Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell out in Idaho. Roughly about 5 years ago, they went on a little bit of a killing spree thinking that the world was going to end by July.  July passed and … Oops!

                Perhaps by end times they mean the collapse of civilization.
The funny thing is, if Jesus came back, most Christians today would be the first to denounce him and demand his head.

                    The humorous part to me is that Jesus would be denounced by both modern wings of Christianity. I can’t imagine either the “bend me over and give me whatever sin you want” camp of the “Deus vult” camp viewing Jesus with anything but hatred or contempt.

            The end times are always here. Waiting for the rapture, or the second coming, or another fix from someone else to save them is, unfortunately, an actual ‘dead end’ for the race of slaves who actually believe God chose the tribe who wants them dead.

        A ray of hope. The forces of managerialism are clearly in retreat, as is the cult of ideology. Deadweight is being culled in DC and the parasites are shrieking in abject despair. But they cannot eat lamentations and scolding, so they must work or die. The gravy train has derailed. God help me, but I am lifted on this schadenfreude.

        “Most [members of Antifa] are suffering from some form of mental illness, and many are simply losers with nowhere to go.”
I remember reading somewhere a few years ago, don’t remember where, that Antifa is not homogenous nationwide, the cells have different regional characteristics.  The writer said, in DC they are disproportionately low level government workers.  In NYC, they are more jewish graduate students.  In Chicago, Antifa is more black.  It’s in Portland that one more finds the real mentally ill marginal barely-human garbage.

                Good point. Joseph Rosenbaum dead molested five children 9 to 11, Anthony Huber dead arrested seven times for domestic violence plus trying to strangle a stranger, Gaige Grosskreutz wounded repeated B&amp;E burglar.Those weren’t just random guys from the crowd though – those were three people who specifically were trying to attack/kill Rittenhouse.I imagine that there may have also been people burning down Kenosha that day who hung back and didn’t attack him, and were say NGO activists with college degrees in sociology or women’s studies, with friends and good relationships with their families, and without criminal records (happily, the exact kind of people that DOGE is currently defunding).

            Everywhere they’re disproportionately politicians’ kids.
Portland seems most crazy because it’s the most advanced—next to Minneapolis, the birthplace of American antifa. Fully disposable soldiers, fully invisible generals, and no one in between knows much of anything. Orders are chaotically almost-followed without ever really having been given, in aBrownian slime mold simulationsort of way, to close-enough results. (That’s not the language they use to describe it.)
That’s why Minneapolis and Portland were the centers of whatever Operation 2020 was called. (It probably wasn’t called anything.)

        There’s no idealogy remaining on the Left. During the Harris campaign, I heard “Our Democracy”. That’s not much of a rallying cry. It’s even more shapeless than their usual slogans.
Another funny situation is when their ideology bumps up against reality. I cherish these moments, even though the Left will learn nothing, just as a cult learns nothing. Just today Canada closed their $200M effort to dig up bodies buried around native american schools. 0 bodies found. Lol.

                Probably none. It’s more like a team-building exercise.
For example the archeological contracts would have gone to universities or corporations—vanished into administration/management—which arealreadymodel anti-white societies.
The regime is pretty much seamless.
More people now than ever before believe that failed progressive-era school integration schemes were actually a mass slaughter of native children by satanic nuns.
The last white Canadian will be killed for that crime.

        The civil rights movement was a Jewish project to remove the last barriers to Jewish control of American politics and culture. The corruption that followed was a feature of that control, not a bug. It is not just the worst features of black culture that were accommodated, it was the worst features of any culture. For instance, you don’t see much black enthusiasm for the tranny revolution or the Israeli genocide in Gaza. That is white people stuff promoted by the usual suspects.

Right in front of you.  Those who persecute you using ‘social problems’, those who force you to use the women’s bathroom, and so forth.  That IS the enemy…. the one you can see, anyway.
Most people don’t want to fight the enemy, because the enemy is amonst themselves, often part of their families.  It’s disruptive to their lives and difficult for their relationships.  Easier to go along.

        “…a billion-dollar industry sprang up committed to stamping out something that does not exist…”
One could look at it this way, but I see it in another.  The billion-dollar industry is designed to create or promote the (faux) concept of “racism”.  Why?  Because to deny racism is to admit an irreconcilable difference/superiority between Whites and the minority races.  This cannot be allowed under the Left’s ideology.
The above may be considered a distinction without a difference to this group of course.

        If one can label anything ending in ‘ism’ an ideology, then one includes the oldest and most basic building blocks of Western Civilization – i.e. blood and soil ‘nationalism’ and ‘populism.’  Despite the modern age’s twisting of all words’ meanings, at root they simply mean a group of peoplerelated by blood andresiding together in a place they have claimed for themselves.   Excellent explanation, by Padraig Martin, on why I unironically call myself a fascist:https://coldfury.com/WRSA/WRSA-WP/2025/02/23/sunday-think-piece-on-freedom-of-speech-and-you-widest-distribution-please/

            Sharp. Manipulation of language has to be viewed in the same light as restriction on freedom of speech, at least as presented here by Martin. Any dissent threatens the Marxist project and those two linguistic limitations are used to stifle disagreement. Fascism doesn’t allow deviation from cultural, religious and moral norms, so it isn’t as focused on speech content beyond that which dissents from the larger society’s mores. It is indeed a difference with a distinction. My personal opinion on free speech adheres to who/whom, one thing the Marxists got correct, so it evolves constantly with circumstances; at one time I was an absolutist. Situational fascist, maybe?

                I agree.  Clever but accurate term – let me emend it to fascist but situational free-speech supporter.  And yes, it is totally a question of who/whom – when/if we have a genuine and traditional White nation, there is no question that ‘speech’ favoring diversity and sexual deviancy must be banned.  Not merely the speech – the people espousing these concepts must be banished.  “Free speech” is part and parcel of the ‘open society’ espoused by Soros et al.  Being able to criticize and insult others is one thing; actively attempting to destabilize civilization’s foundations is quite another.

                I’m not a free speech absolutist, either.  I believe speech, like business, must be supportive of the people and their nation.  A proper nation simply does not allow criminals to use their weapons and poisons because of “muh freedom.”
Otherwise, you wind up with a situation now where degenerate porn and blm burning and killing is “free speech” and mildly objecting to open borders is “hate speech.”

            “Blood and soil” in our context to me means Christian Europe and what was the Roman Empire and its fringes. (Basically Europe including Western Russia and the other side of the Mediterranean.) But that gets confusing in our country. We have an African component (thanks to the dummies who brought slaves over), an Indian (feather) component, indigenous Mexican by virtue of annexation, and by virtue of the colonies we have acquired, kind of a mixed Spanish-Asian mishmash out in the Pacific. That also helps confuse “who we are,” not to mention that the founding stock is a small minority.

            Conservatives insist on defining “fascism” as “a partnership between government and industry.” Under this stupid definition, everything but libertarianism is fascism.
Historically, it seems clear that fascism is setting up government to serve the legacy population of the country. Enemies of the legacy population are dealt with harshly.
Everyone runs from the term “fascist,” but what solutions to the current problems of whites are not fascist?
I don’t care what word we use, but the cultural conditioning against the word “fascism” is immense.

                I don’t think conservatives use that as a definition. That’s the way things generally have always gotten done in this country. Pull yourself up by the bootstraps independence is only for suckers. It’s only when that partnership becomes heavy-handed do we consider it fascism.

                    Conservatives do use the term that way—almost exclusively that way. They know nothing about fascism except what Ayn Randmight havesaid about it, as they heard second hand from Limbaugh or some podcast dork. American conservatism is libertarian economic reductionism + Y’all Need Jesus (and all his children from the third world, because you get paid too much).Of course that means that almost all actual economic activity is “fascism.” They just don’t say the damning word if it’s a thing they don’t want condemned. When Elon was a wholly state-subsidized Reddit man, he was fascism. Now he’s not (though he remains the same). It’sThe American System! Can’t be otherwise.In reality, fascism is unAmerican because it’s a “workerist” ideology. Among the bodies that all should serve each other, normal losers are included. The boss owesyou, too—and the Economy™ owes the people a future that isn’t all sewn up against them. Conservatives would sacrifice their children—theyhavesacrificed their children—to stop the minimum wage from being pinned to inflation. They’re therealantifascists, as they say.

        Excellent post.Your line “Most are suffering from some form of mental illness, and many are simply losers with nowhere to go.” ties up with my view.We have allowed the losers into the positions traditionally held by alphas and those who got things done. The losers have surrounded themselves with more losers and malcontents until the ended up in charge.They are terrified of the old guard taking back control so have demonised the winners as various fascist and phobes.The pansy’s, fags and crazy cat ladies are hopefully soon going to be sent back to gossiping around the washing areas and cooking pots.

            Yes.  Men have abrogated their traditional responsibilities and further allowed women and wimps to assume more of those responsibilities, to society’s detriment.  There are just too many people nowadays and it’s much harder to keep the vast number of crazies in line.  A major crackdown (and culling) is sorely needed.

        “This may be why the early efforts at dismantling the Blob and the administrative state have been met with a tepid response.”Or maybe – as I suspect – there is broad consensus among more business-minded, sober types that the current bloat is unsustainable. Tim Geithner and Hank Paulson gave an interview last year to that effect. Also Jamie Dimon has come out in defense of DOGE:Jamie Dimon calls U.S. government ‘inefficient’ and says Elon Musk’s DOGE effort ‘needs to be done’Trump’s role is the “bad cop” who can take the flak for getting this much-needed bureaucratic liposuction done.

            I think you have that in reverse. Musk is somewhat of an ascending generation hero. He is there to take the edge off of what needs to be done. If Trump were the face of downsizing government, I think people would be more irate than they are.
But then again, their USAID money has been cut off, so there is no money to pay community organizers and people to stage pallets of bricks at riot locations.

            Abrogated? lol  What I saw living in America between 1970 and 2015 was the calculated mass DISPOSSESSION and DISENFRANCHISEMENT of American boys and men.Perhaps the greatest mass transfer of power and wealth in history during those years, from male to female/government.  I didn’t see doods doing a lot of abrogating.  The alliance between government-institutional power and women took whatever they wanted, and called it all Progress, Equality, Righteousness, Pendulum-Levelling, and Helping the Victims.You make it seem like 100 million males suddenly walked offa the job, tossed down the tools.  That was not how this Faustian deal went down.  It was coercion and ejection, mostly.Did the men of those generations, and of immediately preceding generations, have a part in that great betrayal of masculinity?  Assuredly they did.  Feminism is popular because it rewards females, government, and the parents of females with real wealth and power.Yes, the putatively male White Knights are everywhere in the U.S., particularly in the institutions, because this is where the ‘alpha’ males were slowly culled from your culture, decade after feminist decade.  What remains mostly are simps.Likewise, the dads of daughters certainly have abrogated their traditional responsibilities to their nations and cultures.  In traditional cultures, dads of daughters married females off early.  Why?  Because if he didn’t, and she got in her mid-twenties solo, Ole Dad would have to pay her freight lifelong.No need for that in America and allied nations.  The government, corporations, courts, schools, colleges, and (apostate) churches are the husbands of the nation’s daughters.  They make sure she can live responsibility-and-failure free.  Like planes crashing into copters.So yeah.  Lots of abrogated responsibility by men in that respect.

        Seems like we are talking about the ideology (or lack thereof) of white people – while not an endangered species, certainly a threatened one. A diminishing one. Wogs and negroes, the ascendant species, have different ideology. Which frankly I struggle to understand or relate. But that’s neither here nor there.As whites diminish, white nationalism and/or white separatism (same thing really) will become their ascendant ideology. This is inevitable. It is already happening with Gen Z, as they see their diminishment much more clearly than the older generations who tend to still see the world they grew up in.It is the sad paradox that whites had to diminish before this could happen. The decadence that comes from dominance and all that. I may or may not live to see this “movement” bear real fruit, but it’s not that far in the future, so I might. Of course not all whites will participate, but the ones who don’t will become less relevant.

                When you get down to brass tacks, race nationalism is an ideology of self preservation, which happens to be one of the 2 or 3 strongest innate instincts that humans possess. That isn’t to say that the ideology and the instinct are the same thing, however, self preservation isn’t a factor in any other ism I can think of.

            “It is the sad paradox that whites had to diminish before this could happen. The decadence that comes from dominance and all that.”
Madison Grant (The Passing of the Great Race) and Lothrop Stoddard (The Rising Tide of Color) were warning about these very issues over a century ago.  It’s sad that were still in about the same situation, except Whites are no longer 30% of the world population, but a mere 8%.

        I certainly agree with your main point that for 60 years ideology has been Nothing But a variety of “double-negative” values – e.g. socialism/ feminism/ antiracism/ environmentalism etc have no positive agenda, but are instead all opposed to something (real or imagined) that is “bad”.I would have to disagree with this, however: “It is easy to forget that ideology is an anomaly in human history. Human societies were initially organized around practical concerns like safety. Religion and culture were useful adhesives to bind the people together, but the main purpose of human organization was always rooted in the practical. “With very few or no exceptions; I would say that ancient human societies were all primarily and overwhelmingly organized around their religion; which secondarily provided the cohesion necessary for pursuing practical concerns.That this is neither obvious nor true for modern people is because our way of relating to the world has changed; and the reason why (unless we can return to a religion of some kind that is sufficiently powerful and widespread to become the primary motivator) why All our civilizations will inevitably fall apart.

        I just hope if the spiteful mutants flock back to religion, they don’t go to Christianity. I grew up during a time (the last gasp, it turned out) where the smug and authoritarian types joined the “faith” groups. It turned me off of Christianity then, and it still pauses me from embracing Christianity now. (Even though I have respect for Christians such as Eastern Orthodox.)I don’t want them flocking to Buddhism either, which is more my lane but it does tend to attract the kinds of white people who voted for Kamala.I want them to infest JW. Hell, even Islam. That is a perfect ghetto for them.

                Oooh, I forgot about Unitarians. It’s basically a “church” of progressives now anyway. I don’t think they worship God as much as they worship agnosticism. Though when it was founded, it wasn’t full of progressives, it was full of Deists. Back when it was edgy to believe in God but not Christianity per se.

                    I can’t claim to be an expert on religion, but to me they are all kind of the same. But I can see where believing only in God without any of the other cover stories would be edgy.
I look at the results. Whatever our problems, we still operate world class civilizations. That tells me that there might be something to the idea of Jesus being the physical manifestation of God. We followed those teachings, we succeeded. Now that we have slacked off, We are failing.

        “The result of the long journey is the understanding that there is no universal morality and no universal truth, other than the truth of the human condition.”I’d add natural law to this as well &amp; I mean actual natural law not the utopian lies that deny observable reality such as universalism which is, in my opinion, the most insidious of them all.If you look up where all the radical leftist movements that sprang up early on in the US it follows a geographical pattern that has remained exactly the same across time from the same groups of people. Look at where abolitionism &amp; women’s rights where fomented &amp; then look at an election map that filters only for White voters &amp; you’ll see virtually nothing has changed.Those people are not my blood &amp; they will never stop agitating for a society that is fundamentally alien &amp; hostile to my me &amp; my kin. If they had their way a Whites across the board would have already gone extinct. If not for the pervasive lie of universalism I wouldn’t have to share a country with those people.Thats but one aspect of the lie, the denial of genes &amp; with it the obvious reality that, on average, apples don’t fall far from the tree. The lie that if the alien races were removed everything would be hunky dory (who let them in &amp; handed them power in the first place? Who acts as their praetorian guard?) The lie that Germans are Italians are French are Polish etc, that there’s no differences between them. On its face its utterly ridiculous to think these same groups who have constantly wared with each other since the dawn of time while they had their own countries to live in would magically drop all differences &amp; morph into a homogeneous Euro blob when forced to live together. Thats not even going into the degree these races produce radicals &amp; dysgenic selection pressures.It goes on &amp; on, the root of it all is the idea man is somehow immune to all the human behavior we’ve observed throughout history &amp; we can all hold hands &amp; sing kumbaya. What is today commonly called natural law is an unnatural perversion of nature, its created a vacuum that’s being filled by primitive races that instinctively understand what natural law actually is.Denying observable reality in favor of arbitrary &amp; utopian beliefs is what brought us to this point &amp; unless that changes Europeans will almost certainly become a past tense chapter of history. Dealing with the symptoms of this can only delay the inevitable, at some point a decision will have to be made one way or another. Either Whites accept reality &amp; act accordingly or continue as they were &amp; martyr themselves out of existence by clinging to universalism.

        What Z wrote about the end of ideology is true for most men and married women. Not true for single women, many of the elite and their managerial class and many immigrants.
Ideology provides single women with a way to be acknowledged as a good person without having to do good deeds.
Ideology is also a great tactic for, as Z puts it, the usual suspects to amass power and wealth and for immigrants to get preferential treatment and gibs.
So the battle isn’t over yet.

            ‘Ideology provides single women with a way to be acknowledged as a good person without having to do good deeds.’What motivates women most is social standing, herd placement, how other females see them.  Woke and Feminism — still deeply institutionalized in America — give them herd-strokes and feelgoods, assurances of group protection.  Not only are the pseudo-moral feelgoods free, but they empower and enrich her unjustly to the detriment of others.As you say, she then receives all the protections and perks of ideological correctness, without having to expend any actual effort, or make any sacrifice.A great deal if you can manipulate your way into it.

            Good observation.  I submit that there are plenty of challenges down the road, e.g. ecological degradation, resource depletion, overpopulation, etc., that will light the fires of those with an ideological bent.  Enjoy the respite while you can.

        OT Seems only the people who get here illegally since Jan 20, 2025 will have a chance for citizenship:
“Kristi: “The Alien Registration Act says that within 30 days of being in this country illegally, someone must register with the federal government, and they will be fingerprinted.” “They must announce that they are here, and if they do so, they can avoid criminal charges and fines and we will help them relocate right back to their home country.”

        Agree the Age of Ideology is expiring.  With a little help from my friends, as the tune goes.
‘Ideology is the attempt to fuse the public and private so that private actions are controlled to serve the public good, which itself is aimed at abstract moral claims, rather than the practical maintenance of society.’
That’s correct. The rallying cry of ‘second-wave’ feminism.

        “Most are suffering from some form of mental illness, and many are simply losers with nowhere to go.”
That about sums them up. But ideology remains, and it has a complex interaction with social forces and technology. An essay by Perry Anderson has just been published and it might be worth a glance:

            I think the second clause of that quote is 95% true. I wouldn’t say “losers”, but rather contemporary Western or Western-inspired people who have no “center”. This is the worst casualty of liberalism and it’s opposite face, communism. It removes your moral-spiritual-biological center in favor of your sum production or consumption.Humans aren’t made to live that way, and it makes people go crazy. No surprise that communism sprang from industrialism, which was the first anti-human activity. Even slaves or citizens who built large-scale projects such as pyramids and aqueducts in the ancient times had a half-a-year break; our modern industrial and complex societies force nearly everyone to work in the same place, 8 to 12 hours a day, at least 5 days a week, all year, for 30-plus years. Imagine living your life that way and not being, or rejecting, Christianity or traditional religion. Even I’d probably be a fanatical antiracist if for nothing else.

        Underreported: Kathy Hochul, the Governor of New York, has sent in the National Guard to replace striking correctional officers. The white COs working in prisons in rural parts of the state are protesting understaffing, and increased assaults on them by the black inmates since the state legislature ended solitary confinement.

        I think it is very likely that we will see a retraction back to single-earner families.  If the managerial state collapses, there simply will not be a need for so much managerial labor in all its forms.  As the Government retracts, so does the spending (in theory anyway), and that makes everything cheaper.Trump’s focus on tariffs and elimination of the income tax are a step in that direction.  You don’t need two earners if you’re no longer losing half your income to taxation, and you can control your consumption to manage your single income.The question is whether Trump has time to rewire the economy in 4 years.  Obviously, targeting the State’s bloat is the right attack vector.  Kill the bloat and submit budgets that are half of what they were last year.  In reality, he probably has 2 years because the Big Changes will require an expanded GOP majority in Congress.  Success in the short run might actually lead to some sustainable changes in the long run.It’s easy to forget this, but “government shutdowns” have become largely a thing of the past for one reason and one reason only: NOBODY MISSED THEM.Once that reality dawned on the Government Class, they quickly set up structures to both prevent government shutdowns, and, barring that, to blunt the effects by making everyone “mission essential”.Anyway, I think this stuff by Trump has a good chance of docking the ship at single-income households, and that would be a terrific thing for the country.

                Yep, been saying this for a while.  You can’t gut a government that literally employs 50% of America (Fed/State/Local) and not get a recession.  I don’t view that as a bad thing, but it is a necessary thing.
At no point in my adult life has the Government experienced even a mild recession.

                    ChatGPT would seem to disagree with you.  Basically, 85% of the population are employed in non-government sectors.  The Fed’s employ 2.7% of the population—including the military.  State and local, the rest.  It is doubtful that the Fed’s will cut more than 50% of the workforce, and of course the State and local might need to pick up some of the slack.What can’t be counted upon is what employment depends on Fed funding of various things outside of direct employment through agencies.  This I agree, but don’t expect it reaches near a 50% total.  But in the end, we must realize you can’t borrow and spend your way to prosperity.  Every dime in taxation, is a dime that would be spent by the private sector more usefully.

        Progressives are fundamentally weak-willed individuals. They seek the Mommy State to address all the ‘perceived’ threats around them as they lack the moral constitution to take life head-on with full-accountability. They lack the maturity (or are unwilling) to grasp that Personal Freedom = Accountability + Responsibility.

        Superb, Zman.  I can only hope that what you say comes to pass, that we have gone beyond the need for the mad influence.  That it once again becomes a local overlay, rather than the driver.
But until then, I’m afraid we’ll need that drive to combat the teeming hordes coming our way…so as they try to drag us back down, I’m afraid that they’ll have succeeded, and the schtink ain’t over yet.  Better though, to be within spitting distance, so that’s a hope right there.

        Trump and company are aiming to destroy the Democratic Party, progressivism, and the core pillar of progressivism: “Social justice.” I think they’ll succeed. Replacing racial quotas with merit and strict color-blind enforcement of civil rights law will make DEI, and essentially all implementations of “social justice,” illegal on the federal level. Along with the defunding of the left and the general vibe shift, this disempowers the entire left, financially, legally, and socially. It’s more than a pendulum swing. It’s a checkmate.

        During the Cold War, we saw the full-on power of ideologies, as the Utopians fought the “Better Dead Than Red” crowd. Where America had the edge was in a more sophisticated mass media, particularly the visual arts. Hollywood reigned supreme, and Hollywood was decadent, reflecting the New Yorker’s desire to make a buck, transported to California. What we learned from the Cold War is that people would rather be joyful than productive. The entire hippie period of the 1960s was a time of blissing out on drugs and sex. Marx’s frowning visage couldn’t hold a candle to that, and so we can got McDonald’s in Moscow and Stephen King translated in the local Russian bookstore. The horror of it, for the Communists ideologue, was that it was all so slickly, smoothly easy, as if it had been waiting forever to plug into the Russian infrastructure. The takeaway? Only that America’s great strength as an ideological power remains it’s weaponized cultural industries. When you buy pirated American DVDs on the streets of Tehran, you are saluting the American ideology…— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
