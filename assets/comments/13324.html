        Excellent post as usual. It‚Äôs a great thought, Z. In fact, I tried it myself years ago. I understood how old school proggie/shitlibs worked ‚Äì but I didn‚Äôt understand lesbians, 4th wave feminists, SJW‚Äôs, millennial snowflakes or any of the newer varieties. Couple years back, I befriended a big, fat, lunatic bull dyke at work just to see how her mind worked, in hopes that I could use that knowledge dealing with my own daughter ‚Äì who had just come out of the closet as a militant lesbian SJW. Every day I would make a point of stopping to chit chat, and sound out this animal by asking xer what xhe thought about things.There was nothing to learn. Basically she was a sexually disturbed child with an utterly childish outlook on the world and life in general. My studies were cut short when she got in a fist fight with a vibrant truck driver out in the warehouse. (How you can get in a fight with a fella that can‚Äôt speak English is beyond me ‚Äì but she managed it). She got canned and that was the last I saw of her.What I DID find was this: There are no ‚ÄòAchilles heels‚Äô or weak points. There are no easy kill shots. For those people, their perception is their reality, and they will use any means (up to and including violence) to enforce that reality on others. They will sacrifice themselves, their families and their well being for it too.Long term, I think the only way to free ourselves of them is to change our tactics. Instead of sending nutters and faggots like Spencer and Milo Yabbadabbadopolis in to debate with the infected ‚Äì we will need to go in there ourselves with flame throwers and burn them out. Any rational or reasonable effort at a negotiated compromise will fail.  At this point I don‚Äôt know if I have the stomach for that. Somewhere out there in that pestilent horde is my daughter. Another option might be to let them do it. Let them burn the house down, and they will turn on each other once all the bad thinkers are gone. Their motivations are based in degeneracy and lunacy so they have to fall at some point.That‚Äôs going to be a decision for you boys to make though. As for me, I am going take them straight on whenever they try me. When they find my corpse, it will be surrounded by the bodies of my enemies, and piles of spent brass and the machine gun bolts locked back on empty. I‚Äôm too old for a war ‚Äì but I am still good for a quick, bloody battle if they‚Äôre offering. üòâ(I suppose I shouldn‚Äôt joke ‚Äì but I see why people sometimes go to work or school with AK47‚Äôs sometimes).

I‚Äôve pondered that tactic over the years. Should we maybe be voting for the Hillary‚Äôs, the Bernies, et al., in an attempt to hasten the Coming of the Lord (so to speak). Thing is, you‚Äôd have to watch everything you‚Äôve spent your entire life building be burned to the ground. I, like you, am too old for that shit. I suspect it would take a collection of folks with nothing left to lose to want to walk through that hell, even with the promise of green pastures on the other side.

That‚Äôs why they say you can‚Äôt get people to act until not acting is more unbearable.  Our standard of living has increased so much.  The colonists revolted over a few small, minor taxes.  Man, now we‚Äôre taxed up to our eyeballs.  But we can‚Äôt stand losing what we have, so we bear it.

                There is value in an Obama, a Venezuela, or a California sanctuary state.  They demonstrate that our side actually does have a point.  Many don‚Äôt see the point, though, even if they are starving.  Humans are odd creatures.

            The internet has shown the best way: troll them. Poke them where they are vulnerable and provoke them into overreacting and self-destruction. They are naturally self-destructive, it‚Äôs on us to help speed up the process.

            The zombies of ‚ÄúWalking Dead‚Äù are apt here, in that they just roll on, because that is what they do.  There is no reason, no goal, they just hunt, kill, and eat.  In my experience, lefties aren‚Äôt much different than that.  Looking for more to it is a wasted effort.  They just follow directions.  As is pointed out elsewhere on this thread, they will also simply double down, that is what they do.  You need to create situations where when they double down, it takes them out.

                    The alt-fur thing cracks me up. When I was writing this and wrote ‚Äúwith a furry‚Äù that‚Äôs what came to mind. Cracks me up, which is why I left it. The whole furry thing is so absurd, I can‚Äôt help but laugh whenever I think about it.
Someone should have done some memes with the Fury Road movie or the movie Fury.

                        A few years was looking at colleges with my son over Easter and stayed the weekend at the Marriott connected to the old convention center in Boston. Unbeknown to us it was Comic Con weekend.  JF Christ it was bizarre. These people live in these costumes. Highlight of the weekend was my son leaning over the mezzanine railing and bellowing in Shrek voice ‚Äúall you fairy tale creatures get outta mah swamp‚Äù. Froze the place for a good thirty seconds.

        You are right that we need to infiltrate their communications institutions the way the left has infiltrated and destroyed so many traditional institutions.
On the other hand, the right, alt-right, whatever, are deeply embedded in the organizations that will matter when it becomes a shooting war.  The combat arms of the military, engineers in utilities, food production and transportation.  All the stuff smug urbanites take for granted are supplied by us.

            They are embedded until the PTB figure they are Our Guys(1) when they refuse to slaughter or otherwise oppress normal Americans.  Then they will be fired, punished to the fullest extent of the law/UCMJ, and replacements will be found to do the killing.  Oppressive regimes never lack for manpower as long as the pay keeps coming and the regime looks strong.

            That‚Äôs a good point.  Our side (various flavors of the right) has some key advantages if it comes to violence and everyone‚Äôs forced to pick a side.  The problem is that our side is currently outside the leftist-dominated institutions whose actions are rapidly leading us into violence.

        Good analogy. I always think in terms of three phase insurgencies.In Phase 1 you are organising safe bases, distributing propaganda, and raising consciousness. You are also conducting small scale attacks to build experience and morale. This is the phase were you learn by doing.In Phase 2 the insurgency begins to expand its safe bases. It has gained the resources and experience to conduct larger scale operations to degrade the enemies capabilities.In Phase 3 an insurgency is moving towards decision, It has built up a force capable to meeting and defeating the enemy in conventional battles and is actively moving into and conquering enemy safe bases.The alt right is early Phase 1. Our safe bases are in the internet. Our hit and run attacks are memes, trolling, flashmob demonstrations and banner drops. Charlottesville was the result of an early phase 1 insurgency attempting to prematurely move into phase 2. In military terms we tried to project strength by fighting a set piece battle against a superior and prepared enemy stronghold.Of course it failed. And when it failed the counterattack smashed our networks and wiped out many safebases. We conducted what was basically a Long March and began to reorganise.Here‚Äôs the thing..You dont gain power from demonstrations..you hold demonstrations because you have power. Going onto enemy strongholds and expecting to accomplish anything is stupid.Street brawling and mass rallies are a losing proposition for us because we simply cannot project the strength we need against a superior enemy. Do we need street cadre? yes. But their job should be to mask up and defend normies or flash disruptions of enemy events. People wont care if NaziLarpers get bashed trying to hold a rally. But if a bunch of masked up guys put themselves between a Normies and AntiFa at a Trump Rally they will gain sympathy.Leave the rallies to the normies who have the institutional infrastructure to hold them. Your job is to infiltrate normie institutions (both left and right!), generate sympathy and create value by supporting normies from thier enemies.

        Do we have 30+ years to gaslight SJW‚Äôs and convert normies? I don‚Äôt t think so. We‚Äôre maybe 2-6 years away from being labeled outright criminals and go the way of England should Kamala or someone like becomes potus.In addition we don‚Äôt have real organization or national/local support of any kind.Gun owners have the NRA, we don‚Äôt even have that for our side. We have no form of local support, etc. We lack the ability to help out those who have been harmed by SJW types.Shouldn‚Äôt we be concentrating on developing a support network at this time?

        In the history of evolution, species either adapt to their environment and prevail, or eventually die off as the better adapted species succeed. In our current environment of extreme affluence and excess, parasitic species have the advantage. We are losing the math in this current environment.

        I really love this analogy and it‚Äôs suggested tactics.
I still don‚Äôt believe we can stem the tide in the long term. It‚Äôs not just our enemies but the potential allies who can‚Äôt be red pilled. For sure, Boomers (I am one) are no good for this.
Still the fight must be pursued. Individualism is all well and good but when you are thrown into a prison you will pick your tribe. You have to.

        It is absolutely true that we need to rack up wins on battlefields that we control. And avoid losses on battlefields that the enemy controls.However. The ‚ÄúWe need to stop doing A and start doing B‚Äù articles miss the point.Some of us need to do A and some of us need to do B, and others of us need to do C through Z. None of us need to be lecturing anyone else about what to do or not do.Because:1) Different demographics will respond to different aesthetics &amp; styles. White activism for the proles is going to have to look &amp; feel differently than White activism for the middle &amp; upper classes.2) Constant experimentation is how we will evolve strategies &amp; tactics that work.3) A wide range of simultaneous activities forces the enemy to engage in multiple fronts. While giving foes &amp; supporters alike the impression of a large, broad movement.We should not be debating shitposting vs day walking vs street marching vs college speaking. We should be thinking about how &amp; when to use all of the above in ways that get us wins.

        I just don‚Äôt think the left is terribly afraid of infiltration any more.  They own the institutions, and they have armies of the faithful who are there standing by to ferret out any of the heretics.  The mechanisms are in place to expose, isolate and dispose, and they are constantly vigilant for any signs of the rebellion.  Those on our side who would undertake such a mission consciously would have to be aware that they were likely to be taken down, horribly.I think this is why the vast resources were focused on the ‚ÄúMarch for our Lives‚Äù, and why the anti-gun efforts are stepping up their OPTEMPO.  That is one thing they are afraid of ‚Äî violent push back.  Even if they were able to suppress it, it would be a horror for them, and one from which they might not be able to recover.Take a look at the FBI instant check stats ‚Ä¶. 2.3 million checks in Feb 18 alone.  Checks per month have risen from mid-500K monthly five years ago to 2.0M plus or minus and holding over the past couple of years.  They are afraid of what‚Äôs percolating out here.Also, take a look at the numbers of huntilg licenses still purchased: 1.1M in Texas; 984K in PA; over 700K each in WI, MI and TN; 200-300K not unusual in many other states.  There are a lot of people out here who still shoot, and presumptively adhere to an older ethic they (ie., ‚Äúnormies‚Äù) don‚Äôt want to see eradicated.Thiese statistics likely keep them up at night, and they want to manage their risk by dramatically paring back those numbers.

            Agree with the general sentiment, but 5 years ago the numbers were 1-1.5M per month.  There was a big jump from 2012 to 2013.  You have to go back to 1999 to get numbers in the 500k range.https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf

                OOPS ‚Ä¶ I was typing too fast this morning getting ready for a time commitment and made that mistake.  Yes, I had the FBI stats in front of me but condensed several thoughts in my haste.
For those wanting a summary on NICS #s:
Mid-500Ks +some from 20 yrs back even up into 2005;
1.0M become common in 2008;
None less than 1.0M after 2009;
First 2.0M in NOV ‚Äô12;
3.3M in Dec ‚Äô15, nothing less than 1.7M/mon since then.
And those numbers don‚Äôt even include states like NV, where a state system is used.
Sorry for the error.

        ‚ÄòThe Omega Man‚Äô (1971) with Charlton Heston, is so much better than ‚ÄòI Am Legend‚Äô (2007) with Will Smith. No amount of CGI can make up for bad acting.
But to your point, there‚Äôs a global infection of stupidity around the world when it comes to leadership. And not just government. Universities and private corporations are just as bad.
I suspect when the One World Leader does show up, his brilliance will be so incredible, it will be no wonder the world population gives him full control. THAT won‚Äôt end well!

            KH, have you ever been to SoCal?  The earliest hippies here were from Germany; they setup some of the first health food stores in the country.   They would wander up and down the coast, sleeping rough and picking fruit off trees.

        Bingo.
Another thing to do is to form anodyne organizations based on some benign rather boring interest and have them operate clandestinely. Masonic lodges had a great deal to do with the success of both the American and French revolutions. They were non-political, but helped in familiarizing future revolutionaries with each other.

        We can‚Äôt infiltrate institutions so long as our politics is persecuted within those institutions to the level it is now. Look at James Damore. Before this happens, the left pointing ‚Äúracist‚Äù at people needs to lose its power, and I think we‚Äôre getting there slowly but surely. Another angle that could be used is the law. Set up a non-profit whose dual purpose is to litigate first amendment lawsuits against the left and pressure republican lawmakers to stand up for the first amendment rights of the alt-right. Richard Spencers would not be the ends, they would be the means to the real end which is the lawsuit for the university denying his 1st amendment rights. I think this can work, because it really makes the left look bad when they fight against this. It‚Äôs kind of like the Ghandi strategy. Nonviolent opposition to erode the resolve and public support of the powers that be.

        Basically this is the TRS method.  Start by building communities and offering funds to whites who birth babies.  That‚Äôs where the Alt Right is at.  This is a 50 year project.  Street confrontation should realistically be thought of as something that might happen in the last decades of this century.  Right now we are simply building White Consciousness, end of.

        The thing is though, the humans have a period of unrestricted movement. This unlimited advantage during the day means they can reset the battlefield every day, giving themselves a little edge in the nighttime. They could vampire-proof their compounds and expand their safe area by going around and clearing the vampires out from their hiding places.
This is essentially the scenario inThe Passageby Justin Cronin.  Instead of making the humans stupid, he kept the zampires intelligent.

        I mentioned the Ricky Vaughcast with Vendetta earlier, but didn‚Äôt have time to elaborate.  Vendetta explained that the alt right was very effective when they were allied with the alt-light and the MAGA/America First crowd during the Trump campaign.Shortly after Trump‚Äôs triumph, the alt right split from those groups by pointing out their differences, frequently sneering at them as cucks for being civic nationalists compared to the alt right‚Äôs ethno-nationalist stance.Vendetta and Vaughn believe the alt right needs to mend those differences and focus on their common beliefs in order to appeal to a wider audience.  Most Americans, including many traditional Democrats turned off by the wacky far left, hold favorable views to policies that put American interests first, a strategy that focuses on 1. Reducing legal and illegal immigration, 2. Protecting American jobs and halt de-industrialization, and 3.Staying out of stupid wars.Vendetta also provided an example where Ben Shapiro has been very vocal about protecting gun rights, a popular issue, which makes ordinary Americans more favorable to Little Ben‚Äôs views because they see him as being ‚Äúon their side.‚Äù  In contrast, the alt right figures tend not to concentrate on an issue like gun control.  So that‚Äôs a missed opportunity where they have a chance to be perceived favorably by normies.Uniting by emphasizing these issues, is a better strategy than sending out Richard Spencer and Mike Enoch to the streets and college campuses to talk about organizing an ethno-state.  That kind of talk turns off too many Americans, or at least can‚Äôt get them rallied to fight compared to the popular America First issues like Immigration, jobs, and avoiding war.

            I have many criticisms(1) of Spencer, but this one is ludicrous.  He did not organize Charlottesville or Berkeley.  He did organize U Florida and Michigan.  UF was harmless &amp; ineffectual.  Michigan has taught him the error of that approach.  I have seen video of Spencer recovering from OC spray, as well as in the scrum.  Whatever my criticisms, he has put his safety on the line and gotten hit a few times.  More than 99.99% can say.

Everyone was a little lit, having a good time celebrating &amp; goofing around.None of them knew there were any media left in the room, they had been sent out earlier, but one slipped by detection.Yet again, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Everyone that did it, esp Mike,  apologized profusely to Spencer for quite a while afterward. I thought Richard was going to stroke out, at first, tbh.It took him a good while to get over it.

            You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about and just sound  silly. If you were more ‚Äúinside‚Äù you‚Äôd know that Spencer has not escaped any melees, you‚Äôd understand the piles of lawsuits he‚Äôs dealing with, day in and day out &amp; wouldn‚Äôt repeat ludicrous 4chan talking points like a child.There‚Äôs plenty to criticize Spencer over, (he‚Äôs arrogant and naive, being the biggest complaints),  but this tired talking point you‚Äôre using is just unneeded by everyone.Stop calling people Feds or shills, ffs. It‚Äôs embarrassing.
