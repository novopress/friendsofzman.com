        I’m right with you. It is a business, and I also think the vet model is what we need. Third party pay is the problem, not solution.  I think it also leads to an expansion of what people think are needs that others have to care about. It seems to be a trend that to have to take care of your needs an unusual burden, because you really need another tattoo.

        Given pain killers and sent home..?Yeah, I suppose I could spend an astonishingamount of whatever I have left on a never ending regimen of inexplicably expensive tests, and maybe transplants, by-passes, reconstructions, and equally inexplicably expensive pills.My doctor, who I keep because I pay him, claims to have never even heard of Laudanum, let alone how to make it.  Apparently it’s illegal. (opium, and alcohol) Really cheep to make. Astonishingly addictive, and expensive, cutting edge synthetic opiates are apparently easy to come by. At the pharmacy, or on the street. “Less popular” pain killers-favorites of recreational abusers of yester year-seem to be part of the agenda for terminal folk, unknown costs for patient OR (now) National Insurance Surety Programs.Wanna’ see one of the doctors nurses that actually “see” you rduced to a blithering idiot? Next time they “suggest” a procedure, or test, ask them “How much does THIS hospital charge for that standard service?”, then ask them, “Well, WHO in this hospital CAN say exactly how much will be charged for that?”.If anyone is as sadistic as I am, you might add “Where can I see a copy of the standard translation, and current billing rates, for specific medical “codes”?Warning:Such questions will NOT win you any new cooperative friends in the “Medical” industrial complex.

        If high blood pressure is an issue for you, I respectfully suggest TWO THINGS:
1) start a diet based on the recommendations in the book,“The High Metabolism Diet” by Haylee Pomroy
and
2) start drinking (let’s say, once every other day) an herb tea with MALLOW.
ALL my numbers – including but not limited to blood pressure – improved with these two things added to my usual (NOT strenuous) exercise/movement.
AND: I AIN’T THE YOUNGEST CHICK ON THE BLOCK, EITHER.
Good luck!
