        If every government employee were competent, would we find ourselves in a better state, or worse? I assert we would be worse. We are asking the wrong questions.

        Government is always for sale to the highest bidder, and is never held accountable.  This has always been true, and always will be.  The best real world way to deal with these problems is to minimize the duties of government, and, as much as is possible, hold government accountable to the public (which is really what the Bill of Rights is about).  The founders of the US republic understood this very well, but modern America has fallen for the swan song of “free” government benefits, and for “rights” conjured up and dispensed by the various arms of government.  Unfettered libertarianism does not resolve the wealth, employment, and social safety net issues, but rolling over for government diktats has it’s own sad, unsustainable result.

        I’m in the financial industry.  Right now I’m preparing for a three week exam by the FDIC.  They are going to examine and critique our IT Department as well as numerous other areas.  The person supervising this has had his or her own personal data stolen by some foreign government and he or she is going to tell us what we’re supposed to be doing wrong.  What’s wrong with this picture?

        So what do you do with all of the secretaries, production line foremen, cashiers, and others put out of work due to technology, unregulated immigration, and exporting jobs?  I have been among the bureaucrats and that’s precisely what most of them would have been 40 years ago.What you need is a modified “Marching Morons” solution.  Keep wages down, give them somewhat meaningful work, and then pay a small cadre of 108-plus professionals real wages to keep things running.  Capital deepening and increasing IT-related productivity keep you from burning out the cadres like in the original story.Ultimately, you have to find a clever, but not humiliating way to keep the less able from voting in demagogues at the polls every few years.  Or at least tie the demagogues hands so they stop emptying the public purse in search of uninformed votes.

            The great challenge of the coming age is how will the new global techno-elite manage and care for the billions of people with nothing to do. If automation can provide for most of human want, the value of labor, physical and mental, drops to near zero. Busy work sounds good until you spend five minutes at the motor vehicle bureau or in a local courthouse. It’s a problem alrwady showing up in employment numbers. We can fake those numbers for a while, but not forever.
Collapse is a word that keeps coming to mind.

        “No man is so virtuous that he will refuse the highest bidder.”
There is a story about Churchill which, though it maybe (as these things often are) apocryphal, illustrates the point.
Churchill, talking to some pompous society dame: “Madam, would you sleep with me for £1000?”
“Why yes, of course.”
“And would you sleep with me for £1?”
“Heavens no! What do you think I am?”
“Madam, we know what you are. We are merely haggling over the price.”

        “A century ago bankers and monopolists controlled western governments, buying politicians at every level.”
Woodrow Wilson was chosen to be President by a Wall Street banker, Bernard Baruch, even mainstream Historians will tell you this, the US got involved in WWI because the bankers wanted and they already controlled the White House.
