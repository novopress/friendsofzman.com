        You have one party rule. We have it out here on the Left Coast, but it’s because they elect Dems. There are pockets of resistance, but soon the entire coast will be like California. There’s no reason for a two party system, if you don’t have an opposition party.

        Wasn’t Obama more of an insult to the voters? Much, much more? Look what the purists have wrought.

        the picture that emerges is of a party that has no idea why it is a party anymore. All they know is they are not Democrats. The Democrats are not much better as they are just a collection of fads designed to piss off the squares in normalville. One party is a revolt against commonsense, the other is a response to that revolt, with neither having anything to offer beyond hysterics.We’ve been here before.  The old  “party that has no idea why it’s a party” was the Whigs, who seemed to exist only to “oppose” the Democrats…. whose only purpose was to kick the secession can a bit further down the road each election cycle.  The only issue anyone wanted to talk about was slavery, and that’s the one topic both parties used all their considerable talents to keep muzzled.The Whigs, of course, ceased to exist before the election of 1856. And the election after that one was a bit problematic…..This is not to say we’re headed for a civil war.  (Personally, my money is on an openly fascist law-n-order party emerging in the wake of huge anti-immigrant pogroms and end-of-the-EBT-cards riots.  Think Trump, if he got an ideology and some stormtroopers).  I’m merely noting that our heavily-armed population, with its well-established revolutionary tradition, has been in a very similar situation in the past.  We’ve been through this sham of “representative government” before; it didn’t end well.

            “Personally, my money is on an openly fascist law-n-order party emerging in the wake of huge anti-immigrant pogroms and end-of-the-EBT-cards riots.”Same here.  Tyrants are often a response to disorder.  When people on the right warn of a “man on a white horse”, I think people imagine it will be some sort of military leader to whom the overburdened and outraged middle class flocks to protect them from (and punish) the libertines and loafers who’ve made life impossible.  But it could happen the other way around.  It could be the elites who look for some strongman to defend them from the appalling hordes of commoners yelling for their heads.  Isn’t that how Napoleon got to the top?  He didn’t lead a revolution of commoners; he was hired by the government to save them, and then turned the tables and took the top job for himself.  History is full of elites who end up outsmarting themselves.

                It could go either way.  And re: Napoleon, the scariest thing is that even we pessimists haven’t really been taking the army into account.  The ass-kissing PC pogues among the officer corps will no doubt keep taking orders from whatever currently occupies the White House, but… what happens when the National Guard redeploys to quell domestic disturbances?  Like the Roman legions of old, our military has quite a few foreigners serving to get their citizenship papers.  Are they going to muzzzle-thumpabuelitasbecause some REMF weekend warrior orders them to?  And how long will the real professionals continue to take insults like ladies in Ranger school, mandatory pregnancy vests, ROTC cadets in red high heels….?Continuing to count on the blind loyalty of under-equipped troops — that you openly loathe — while hanging them out to dry in yet another endless, pointless neo-imperial police action is a bad idea.  Subsequently asking them to fire on the home folks is an even worse one… but that’s a risk Our Betters seem quite willing to take.

        “The thing with Romney is that he said the right things, but no one believed him.”How could anyone believe Romney?His top campaign advisor told you that Romney would say anything to win.Remember the Etch-A-Sketch remark?Romney meant nothing that he said.He was the presidential candidate sent over by Central Casting.Romney was just a handsome version of RINOs Boehner, McConnell, et al.God knows what Romney would have signed after Sandy Hook?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmtPA02SNk“WASHINGTON — Eric Fehrnstrom is Mitt Romney’s David Axelrod.He is the keeper of the candidate’s narrative, the guy who has been with Mr. Romney since before he was governor of Massachusetts and has stuck like glue through two grueling presidential campaigns. He has been the defiant defender of Mr. Romney when he has been accused of being a flip-flopper or having no core principles.And so it was curious that when Mr. Fehrnstrom on Wednesday reached for a word to describe how Mr. Romney might pivot to the general election, the one that came tumbling from his mouth was “Etch A Sketch,” the children’s drawing toy in which nothing  is ever permanent.http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/us/politics/etch-a-sketch-remark-a-rare-misstep-for-romney-adviser.html?_r=0

        Solzhenitsyn wrote about the Nazis invading Russia  during WWII. They had to overrun and occupy a few hundred kilometers of the western edge of the Soviet Union before the actually got into “Russian” territory. Later, when the Germans had to retreat, many of those occupied people picked up stakes and retreated with them. Imagine that – choosing the Nazis as the lesser of two evils.That’s how I felt about Romney in 2012. Maybe he’d do well, maybe not, but for God’s sake’ *anything’s* better than this evil dimwit of a Marxist dick-tater we’ve got now.I’m pretty sure there’s many more like me out here. It would be nice if we had someone in office with a smidgen of respect for the Constitution, and at least some respectable level of determination to uphold it. There’s a couple of candidates on the GOP side now who offer more than hysterics. Maybe we’ll be blessed and one of them can work his way to victory.
