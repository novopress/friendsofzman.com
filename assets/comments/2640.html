        So we have 6% black voter turn out in Ferguson, where they could really affect the local community. But we are supposed to think they will turn out full force to elect a Senator?
And yes, anyone with any sense would point out who will get hurt the most by amnesty. The problem is that both sides are in favor of it.

        If there were such a thing as an astute Democrat observer–there isn’t–he might think that a Republican Congress and Executive would be a very necessary thing to insure the onward march of “progressive” politics. Because without a Reagan like pause in politics what is circling the drain will go down the drain, and if it is in fact too late to escape the final flush, it is better for the socialists to have Republicans in charge for that spectacle.I have not seen a single Republican outline a plan going forward. When I do hear the Ryan’s and the Paul’s speak on a single issue it is clear they have no grasp, and worse, no courage. Universal suffrage is a powerful thing.If there is going to be a change of parties we understand that the most which can be expected is that the reins will be pulled back, because we are not going to be actually changing horses.

        “While Democrats always seek to increase African-American turnout, that they are taking such aggressive steps to rally their most loyal constituency reflects the increasingly difficult landscape they face.”This suggests the proper strategy the GOP should take towards the black, and the Hispanic vote:  seek to suppress it as much as possible.The GOP is obsessed with the idea of attracting black and Latino voters to the party.  That is neither feasible nor necessary.  But convincing those voters to stay home, while rallying its own base, can lead to a great victory for the GOP.What’s left of the old Democrat coalition is held together by strings and glue.  It’s held together by the increasingly wispy personality of Barack Obama.  In an era of increasing austerity, in a coalition that depends on government largess, it shouldn’t be too difficult to set elements of that coalition against each other.Blacks and Hispanics are natural enemies.  Set them against each other.  The GOP should run ads addressed to the black community that never mention the GOP, but play up the amnesty issue as a betrayal by Democrat elites.  Mass immigration lowers wages and increases competition at the trough.  This point needs to be hammered home by the GOP, not to attract minority votes, but to depress minority voters in the hope that they stay home on election day.
