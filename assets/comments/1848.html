        great post, Zman. You depict the bias of the media outstandingly.  and the uselessness of the Repubs is never clearer than in their craven bowing to the media.

        Z your advice for the GOP is doomed.Why? Because Republicans thirst for death. My wife was active in State politics for a number of elections being a County agent for a successful Senate candidate and a failed Governorâ€™s race (he won the next time he ran). We saw how shallow they were and neither were intellectual powerhouses but both could charm people with the power of their personalities. She and I met during those years many other successful politicians all being Republicans and none being deep thinkers or truly committed to anything more than being elected. Democrats on the other hand ALWAYS have an Agenda.Dan Kurt
