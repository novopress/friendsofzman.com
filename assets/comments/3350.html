        @z  Finally someone else said it — “eliminating the troublesome students and teachers”.  My spouse has 27 years teaching in Miami – Atlanta ghetto schools.  About 15-20% of “students” in the classroom have no interest in learning but are adamant about disrupting the class and inhibiting the ability of the rest to learn.  There are a few other factors worth noting;Many minority children arrive at kindergarten already behind the curve.  They do not know how to use utensils, sit in chairs, follow directions, etc. It takes 6 mos. to a year to get them up to institutional levels of behavior, if at all.In generations past, smart women were limited to teaching and nursing professions.  Now smart women choose from the universe of professions and the talent pool is watered down.Affirmative action , diversity etc., has placed individuals in administrative positions for which they have no ability.  Most schools have to create positions for capable middle aged white women who do the real work in administration while the diversity crowd go to “meetings”, and hold the titles.The parents of children who can, remove their students from public education and enroll them in private, Christian, ethnic schools.  Not surprisingly these students are educationally, culturally advantaged and their departure from the public schools lowers the test scores dramatically for public education.Curriculum is forced on school systems and teachers from cultural “elites”, eager to promote the latest social memes. See: sex ed for grade schoolers, anti-American history, feminist centered policies to diminish masculine development in young boys, etc.In America everyone is required to be educated in school until their 16th birthday.  Only a few other white countries take on the task of educating everyone in their population.Thanks for listening to the rant.

        Journalists being experts in their chosen areas of self-thrilling? Oh no… Could it be too that a lot of signatories to the IPCC ‘reports’ on global warming are not only uneducated in science but are simply  journalists who like typing big words like ‘catastrophe’ and ‘armageddon’?
Say it ain’t so.

        School is like a factory. Garbage in means garbage out. We could improve the public schools by eliminating he troublesome students and teachers, but not enough to move anyone to do it.

        That display of logic and critical thinking cannot be acquired in a journalism class.

        Increasingly, the problem with American education is that it is a system. One system. If jimmy carter had, after creating the Department of Education, made General Motors the sole automobile provider for the US, what is it we think we would be driving now?
