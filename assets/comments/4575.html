        My favorite episode of Hogan’s Heroes involves the creation of a copy of Manet’s The Fifer; or as General Burchalter calls it “Ze Boy viss ze Fife”.

            A hoary old BBC TV comedy series was ‘Allo ‘Allo which featured hapless French resistance workers and incompetent occupying Nazis, centred round a cafe. One of the on-going plots hinged on a painting called ‘The Fallen Madonna With The Big Boobies.’
Yes, it was that sort of show.

        Or you could end up with the story of Hans van Meergeen, who was busy as a successful art forger prior to WW2, specializing in Vermeer. Homemade authentic paints, the works. (He had even worked out that Vermeer used badger hair brushes.) One of his paintings ended up being sold to Goering. (Not a particularly good one.)He was charged as a collaborator, but was able to show the painting wasn’t authentic. So the court dismissed the collaboration charge, and charged him as a forger.The lesson here is evidently you were supposed to be honest when dealing with Nazis.
