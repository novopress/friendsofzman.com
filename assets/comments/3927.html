        Two of my kids were assaulted and one held against her will by a county cop’s son.  The judicial nightmare afterwards went on for a year.  Three judges recused themselves after admitting they were friends of the family and I finally persuaded the state to send in a state prosecutor due to the county prosecutor collaborating with the accused and lying on his behalf.  The transfer of the case resulted in missing key evidence (the gun and phone records just disappeared) as well as an altered police report, a cop being retired, and one of the investigating officers on our side killed in a freak accident after his head somehow hit a sign on a sign post they say.  I had social services at my home, threats of charges from the prosecutor’s office… the amount of corruption was astonishing and scary.  It should have been a simple case because we had witnesses, phone records, the gun, and two recordings precisely describing what happened.  We ended up losing.  GOOD JOB PROTECTING YOUR OWN YOU CORRUPT BASTARDS!

        John F’in Kerry was and is broke. His personal currency as a man is worthless. His recent TV thing was right out of The Twilight Zone meets 1984.
Double speak Esperanto mixed with platitudes, parables and new-think failed dogma. He makes used car dealers look sincere.

        I don’t think many of our elected representatives (and I mean all houses, state and national) were “penniless” when they got to their positions, except in a relative sort of way. They damn sure don’t leave with less than they had when they started.

            John Forbes Kerry was broke when he arrived in Washington. He literally had no money, not even enough to rent a place initially. He left the Senate as the richest man in both houses. Granted, he bagged two rich widows in his time in DC, but he also used insider trading rules to amass a fortune.

        I knew we were in trouble when one of the first things the Obama administration announced upon taking office,  they would no longer enforce the DOMA.  Failure to enforce our immigration laws followed closely and the continuing slide of lawlessness continues to this day.  It’s not enough for this bozo to have affirmatively actioned his way to the top of our government, but he relishes in flaunting the office and pushing limits beyond boundaries imagined by our founders.  Obama voters, I really hate you.

        Senatorial class saw their interests in centralized authority and therefore went along with the drift toward empire. Given the choice between one of their own having dictatorial power and sharing power with the lower classes, they chose the former.

How’d that work out?
If the ruling elite of Rome really wanted to restore the republic, they would have done it.

        A fitting quote fromLe Cygne Gris:
“We are stuck on the modernist myth of America, a nation of laws. Unfortunately, laws without morality are merely hoops to jump through, and no number of codified regulations can save a nation that is morally corrupt for, fundamentally, laws must be interpreted and enforced by men.
Thus, we are clinging to the false god of rule of law.
The truth is that we have always been ruled by men all along.  Now that men are thoroughly corrupt, we see what a charade rule of law really is.”

        The other day a guy told me that in his view you couldn’t trust the police. Normally I’d let such comment pass but he also told me he had been cop, so he had seen the untrustworthiness from the inside.I tend to regard Robert Peel as a sort of hero in that he wanted a police force that was just as much subject to law as everyone else was but were people empowered to make lawful arrests and therefore help bring order to society. Over the past near-200 years the reputation of the police force has fallen and increasingly many people believe that as the police cannot and will not protect ordinary citizens then it is best for the law-abiding population to make whatever lawful arrangements they can to protect themselves.My thankfully limited experience of crime involved me once calling the police about a minor crime committed against my property and all I got was a number for the purposes of insurance  to show the cops had received my call. I am not alone in thinking “why bother calling?”It reminds me of the joke about the man who calls the cops to say  a burglar is in his garden shed and he is told that they are all too busy to respond and they’d be along in a couple of hours. So, a few minutes later he called the cops and said not to worry as he had killed the burglar.Within a minute cop cars with lights flashing swooped on his house, a police helicopter appeared overhead and a dozen police officers rushed to the shed. No one was there, and no body.“I thought you said you killed a man,” said one exasperated cop.“And I thought you said you were too busy,” said the man.Funny-true maybe, but I bet he was charged with wasting police time after the laughter died down.

            In Suffolk County New York, the police no longer respond to break ins. They don’t take finger prints or collect evidence. Unless someone is harmed or government property is involved, they consider it an insurance issue.  No police department in America looks for stolen cars. For the most part, the only reason you involve the police in these matters is the insurance company requires a police report.
