        Our ruling whites are like the audience in “Radical Chic,” but without the black fascists.

        It used to be the case that the lower orders aped their betters. Now it’s the other way around. Not an improvement.

        On the subject of tattoos, where I live the underclass (they live on one side of the village though thankfully not my side of the railway tracks) appear at the local supermarket in all weathers in clothes designed to show their tattoos. if it is raining, or snowing they still appear wearing sleeveless tops and shorts so that we can all admire  their wide range of tattoos up their arm, up their legs and as a high water mark at their necks.The neck tattoos are particularly disturbing to see because you can tell the wearers of these engravings are desperate to be allowed to get them creeping up their face. The ‘law’ supposedly says it is illegal to tattoo the face though some try it: I remember one lad on TV with a horrific spider web tattoo across his face who was complaining that he couldn’t get a girlfriend. I also saw, in another store a few months ago, with a guy who must have been in prison for murder because he had crudely done home-made tattoos on his face including the tell-tale teardrop under one eye.I understand the underclass and criminals then love tattoos, even if they not only fade but make them look incredibly ugly, but it is when the middle class get them as if it is some sort of communion with the lower end of life that amazes me. Everybody wants, it seems, to play at being poor and stupid.

        White nationalists see this and believe it is being done on purpose. That’s only partly true- the left likes to see poor white girls breed with coloreds, but would prefer poor white boys not breed at all. But if they do it with coloreds it’s better.

        Everything you say is true, but still, the fish rots from the head. We have a really bad ruling class, interested only in their own well being, which includes a narcissistic sense of moral superiority. We are run by people who test well, and are convinced of their own moral and intellectual superiority. They are as blind as French aristocrats a decade before the guillotine. Our intellectual class, who run the culture, and our financial class (75 years ago investment bankers were actually investment bankers who understood business) are running this country into the ground. We really will have to wait until the stone hits ground level. Tim

        The Angry Pharmacist had some good stuff to say about this kind of thing years ago. He doesn’t post much anymore but here are some related white ghetto posts concerning fibromyalgia from 6-7 years ago.

This has been in the motion for years now unfortunately.

        The short answer is the system pays the baby mammas.  Take away the financial incentive to have children out of wedlock and this sorry mess disappears.

            I’m not sure there is an answer. The ball is rolling down hill and it stops when it gets to the bottom. Wars requiring large numbers of men to run into the other guy’s guns are no longer a weeding mechanism. Child birth and disease no longer take out large numbers of poor women. In a way, we are creating the same problem the West created in Africa. By mitigating nature’s culling mechanisms, we end up with more of what we don’t want.

                Idiocracy wasn’t a fun comedy, it was a documentary from the future.
