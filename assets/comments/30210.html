        What possibility exists that this is a Kagan “hail-Mary”, clocks-run-out, long-bomb…? You’d never know today that just a few days ago, that Putin was done for, I wish someone would tell him for  ffs.ll the apparent chances he’s had to be thrown into the klink.

        trump is making nice noises about kennedy.   would a fusion ticket have legs?   has there ever been a fusion ticket?   given trump’s age, kennedy is guaranteed a shot at the top, in 2028.

            Lincoln/Johnson.Recently Kennedy said he would oppose gun control. Given that’s such a shibboleth of the Left, it took me aback. It indicates something is in the works. I cannot see the GOP permitting someone other than one of its cucks to run as Veep. I think it also very well may keep Trump out of the top slot regardless of the primary results.I honestly believe that if somehow such a thing happened, and it is highly unlikely, there would be an out-in-the-open coup to keep the war grift going. Make no mistake, everything taking place is to keep war being waged, first abroad then against the domestic population. These folks are evil and play for keeps. They are telling you their plans.

            I watched that entire video, forgive me for having no sympathy for the men in it. If they’re mercenaries then they deserve it, they knew the risks and went anyway. If they’re Ukes then let them free themselves from the monsters running the country.
Just remember, the whites on the Ukrainian side and the mercenaries aren’t and never will be on our side. This war will cull many of them so we don’t have to deal with them later.

            I’ve said it before: Jefferson Davis, one and only President of the Confederacy only served 2 years in prison for an actual insurrection and violent rebellion (or so all the history books tell me)
Probably wouldn’t have served a day if Lincoln hadn’t been shot.
Something about wanting to heal wounds and unite the country.  What a bunch of unsophisticated primitives.

        Cross, double-cross, triple-cross?Gangster mercs? Turf battles?  Criminal politicians milking the cow?Factions of the Family at war?This is classic Shin Bet (Israeli) politics.Or Mafia, or Cartel.Like Treasuries, this means the Jevvish Century isn’t over by a long shot.The White West has adopted Their gangsta culture.(As we have done, long before, and since.  The symbiote shapes the game.)Erase the borders- that is, the Westphalian Order- well, erase the uniforms too.  The nature of battle has changed from clearly marked army lines and careers to esoteric subversion, corruption, spies, private legions, and civilians.Of course Putin was pissed. This is rogues operating in his own house, and between Tribal factions.Russia is ruled, still, by old-line Chabad.  He’s trying to carve out a space in the Globo World Order.Denial, Anti-S, and Nazi nationalism are illegal, while WEF programs are pursued.(His mother’s maiden name is Shelomova; he’s 1/4, and was raised by Chabad mentors.  His career began by stealing $120M of relief money after the Fall and murdering his electoral rival, in St. Peterburg.  “Somebody” let him do it, as has happened with our immunized criminals over here.The difference is, Putin’s masters, unlike the Americans, have a decent thing and don’t want to wreck the place- unlike our own Maccabees.It gets forgotten that the Saduccee and   Maccabee types attacked their own first.  Just as we do, as all do. As shtetl immigrants from the Pale hated their German-based brethren, ethnic Democrats snubbed by ethnic Republican golf clubs. A Family status fight.  There has never been racial unity, not by anyone.)That a bunch of jumped up upstarts in America have decided they want to take over previously held Tribal territory- first, the Warsaw Pact (look at the Party bosses), then the EU, and now, Kazaria- well just a minute, another Branch had already claimed that.There is no right of return, and you can’t have our cows.So an ethnic street gangster, who branched out from street business chains to billion-dollar military supply contracts, extended that into fronting a profitable and useful foreign legion.All normal.Breaking a bit under the extreme front-line stress, I’m sure, this audacious lad- from a type that swings for outrageous fences- is sounded out for a deal.  He is, after all, a mercenary.He three-ways between an ethnic dictator, the cabal in America (who have successfully gained full control of the administration after a sham “election”, just like the dictator), and the dovish, patriotic shabbos.He gets paid by the one, seems to offer aid by default to the other.  He pulls his stunt at height of the failing counteroffensive  staged with their NATO backup in place, fully plying mythic Russian themes…And then the triple-cross: he has already informed his Chabad customers.  They split the money, able to fund a recruiting drive of Aryans, because their primary income source has been squeezed.The patriotic shabbos is able to purge schemers.  His bosses’ interests are protected.  His ally Luka receives a show of support against Polish spies and b!tch-slaps the upcoming Vilnius conference in Lithuania, strengthening his own position at home.  Plus nukes and plausibly deniable rogue actors, 100 km from Kiev..The population loves it.  Almost no blood is shed. He’s bought time.Recruitment takes on a WWll vibe.   BRICS leaders eyeing the CIS payment system are impressed.The mercenary, still useful, goes to a working sabbatical in Belaurus.  His chutzpah has succeeded, his contracts negotiation secured. More a Belarius than a Brutus.The Americans fume and sputter, hinting at nukes as they have done with Iran since 1979.  The Israelis increase their many quiet weapons and oil contracts with Russia. The Ukrainians still receive income from the remaining pipelines, but at a renegotiated rate.There is no honor amongst thieves- and yet, there is.  Especially when they are playing chess in the fog of war.We’re returning to the Cold War.That is what multipolar means.  All the players grew up in that retinue, those are the rules they know.The Long March through the White World will continue.  This is the False Peace they prophesied- until They are the last intelligent ones left.  Or so they think.

        The reason we are mystified in the west is that we have finger puppets and clowns for leaders instead of statesmen… and we’ve come to accept and expect it. That – and we don’t think like the Russians. This was just your typical communications fustercluck courtesy of Darwin and Murphy.Priggy flipped out. Simple as. Old people get erratic and silly. Biden can’t even pretend to be a leader even with a team of trained zippers micromanaging him.If you put geezers into combat roles…they may crack on you. Before he cracked, Priggy was famous for his antics. He lipped off at members of the Russian high command (who often deserved it) and was openly contemptuous of his adversaries among the Russian REMFs, stuffed shirts and brass hats.He was also an unflagging Russian patriot, dedicated to his men and the Russian people. They loved him in return and would fight and die in the bowels of hell for him…and they would probably win. Putler loved him too; the man spoke truth to power and real leaders need men l with the courage to do that.You don’t erase, whack, or disappear men like that, you retire them. Or you put them out to pasture where they can go on light duty and get a break. Priggy is very, very good at killing Ukranians and you don’t want to lose experience like that.Contrast that with America in the current year: you racialize your military, throw out the experienced older white guys with several deployments under their belt, and replace them with unqualified, un-blooded perverts, women and vibrants. What can possibly go wrong?What we are seeing is an huge error in communications, and real statecraft in dealing with it.  This is what America will look like after the Restoration, once clown world burns to the ground and its adherents and traitors are genocided or carted of to die in work camps.

It’s hard to describe what I’m talking about but I’m talking about someone like Pete buttigieg who was reportedly be making resumes of himself when he was 14.
I feel that sort of hyper competitiveness creates a more narrow kind of person. Like there was this quarterback at USC in the late 80s who clearly was pushed too hard by his parents and I likewise see the same thing happening in academics.

            You’re in the ballpark with this idea, but it’s not really meritocracy that does this, it’s credentialocracy. The distinction is subtle but important.

                Indeed.  Meritocracy is enveloped by your potential.  Whatever your station/situation in life, you strive your best and hopefully rise to the top within such.  Potential is a topic for another day, but often hinted here in comments.    Credentialocracy (credentialism) as you put, it is an evil tiger moms and others have been known for.  To attempt to achieve beyond the limit of your potential is ego destructive and mentally damaging.
Perhaps the difference is not so subtle, but where the line gets crossed certainly is.

                Yes. Because it is credentialism, the United States has a very rigid caste system now. Meritocracy is literally democratic, and to paraphrase Erdogan, that’s just a train to get where factions wanted and then they disembarked. Democracy was used to get to Point A, and now a caste system has been imposed to make that place evergreen. They are tearing up the tracks now.

Also OT, whatever happened to the golden mean? Why the lurching from one extreme to the other?
Farther afield, kind of goes to my musings on will. Clarity (and simplicity) at the margins, so they’re seductive. One must be mindful and disciplined to not be seduced.
Modern world discourages that, wants us to be robots or animals, not human beings.

        Really bizarre.Prigozhin has put out some other crazy statements and videos as well. Perhaps losing his sanity. Understandable, as living in a war zone must be tough.If this were the case, it would explain why Russia was so prepared to handle the insurrection. They probably saw his mental decline and were considering him an increasingly less reliable figure.The question is what role did the US play in the incident? Maybe they were pushing on the open door – Prigozhin saw the writing on the wall, and the US seized the opportunity, manipulating the mentally unstable man into doing something crazy, capitalizing on his unhappiness against Putin and Shoigu. The 6.2 billion dollar “rounding error” is extremely suspicious.Perhaps once he started the march Prigozhin realized how hopeless the situation was for him. Lukashenko gave him a choice – he can either be droned within 10 seconds, or accept a “retirement” in Belarus. Yes or no answer needed immediately or the drones start. And the money goes to Putin of course.Agree with Z that other explanations don’t make sense. Tl;Dr Probably a mental breakdown combined with encouragement/manipulation/hypnosis from the USA. Russia was expecting this from the increasingly erratic man and made him a deal he can’t refuse, which he wisely accepted.

        From my comfortable chair on the gulf coast, I’m partial to the ‘Prigozhin snapped’ view. No doubt there was some urging by the GAE, but it’s hard to guess how much of a factor that really was. Then once he got a few miles down the road, he realized he didn’t have the support from his troops that he thought he had. Perhaps he initially misled them about what he really had in mind. The Kremlin, reticent to kick off a massive bloodletting on Russian soil while at war in Ukraine, thought it more expedient to make a deal and sort out the mess later at a time of its choosing.Shoigu is a real piece of work. The Atlantic called him a martinet, and that’s hard to dispute. Never served a day in the military yet he goes around in uniform with loads of medals on his chest.The big thing the “coup” confirmed is the unity of the Russian people in this war effort. Putin is in charge, but it isn’t about him now, if it ever was.

        It’s extremely difficult to follow what’s actually going on in this war since every source is propaganda, but the best model I can come up with is that there are no good guys.Neocons in the US want to butcher Ukrainian peasants to get kickbacks from the MIC contracts.  The chaos also provides good cover for harvesting Slavic children’s organs for their various Jewish blood rituals and immortality treatments.Zelenskyyyy and the rest of the Ukrainian government want to butcher Ukrainian peasants to take their cut from the foreign aid checks and sell off the equipment they receive.Prizogin…Pirogi…Pepperoni, whatever his name is, wanted to butcher Ukrainian peasants in order to establish himself into the Russian oligarchy.Shoigu wanted to trick the Ukrainian and Russian peasants into butchering each other to a Pyrrhic victory in order to keep Pirogi from threatening his position as a corrupt general.Putin wants to butcher Ukrainian peasants in order to force the globalists to finally accept him as their boyfriend and take him to the prom.Notice the common result of all these guys getting a lot of money and power marching peasants into a meatgrinder.  There is no negotiation because the psychopaths are all benefiting from an endless conflict.  American peasants may not be getting exploded at least, but we are the ones paying for all of this.

        To me the whole thing is kind of strange.  The same personality who thought marching on Moscow was a good idea gave up at the first sign of even token verbal resistance and agreed to be exiled? This really doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.The Russian state’s reaction doesn’t make much sense either. In most cases, when you take up arms against the government, you either win or you die or spend life in prison lest anyone else get any bright ideas about how weak or strong you may be.3d chess doesn’t make much sense either.  If we will ever know what exactly happened, it will probably not be for another 30 years or something.

        I wouldn’t be surprised if a not so small part of the Kremlin believes that it can just wait the U.S. out for our copious domestic problems will catch up with us.  The problem is, as those problems get worse and worse, unlike the USSR, we’ll be projecting the attention of the American people more and more outward.  So as we stumble on the world scene, like a drunk desperately looking for a fight, we’ll go try and find one.The more our county sinks into the mud, the more the Sean Hannities in the media and the DC people will be screaming “look over there!!!”  It’s an incredibly dangerous time, and we should already have seen how dangerous it is a few years ago, when they aggressively herded people into getting Covid shots.

            This is exactly right. Once the Regime cannot project abroad it also will use the military on the domestic population. That’s actually sort of an argument for staying in Blue places unless it becomes even more explicitly anti-White in nature than it is now, highly possible. .

                One reason they’re so desperate to empty US arsenals to send to Ukraine, it seems to me, is that places like Florida might get uppity in the not so distant future when the crackdowns really start.

I think the copious NATO problems will catch up first. This war is having a very deleterious effect on European economies that’s not really talked about in US media. Time is on Russia’s side in this respect and they likely believe a brokered, but favorable peace proposal that will draw more interest as the EU gets poorer, and more unemployed.

            As we often point out, the problem with “Democrat-run cities” is those cities’ demographics, not their politicians. Vermont and Minnesota, e.g., have always had wackjob pols, but their cities were nice places to live until Catholic Charities et al. bussed Africa into them.Similarly, California changed from paradise to paradise-shaped human feces sculpture when its population was replaced with a worse one. California Democrats’ managerial incompetence level is normal, but a crappy population magnifies flaws in the system.Back in the eighties I met quite a few kids like me who were born in California then moved elsewhere as soon as their hippie parents’ sense of familial responsibility kicked in. For every one of us who tagged out, eight Aztec goblins scrambled over the ropes (waved in by the ref).Of course It was mostly Democratic Party-aligned entities who conspired to crappify the population, and who benefit from it. But the politicians there are pretty average.

                Good synopsis. As is important is the rise of centrally planned interest rates and its affect on the nature of Silicon Valley. Those interest fueled huge and sustained artificial booms that imported into the elite a class of people wholly alien to California and the US. California was once mostly native and conservative who got barely outgunned by the hippie enclaves in SF/Berkeley and the hipsters in the glitter parts of LA.It could have survived the invasion from below, but the invasion and replacement from above, with the supplanting of the rugged Boomer SV exec-manager-engineer cohort with GenX+ imports and the heavy alien imported labor was too much. Even the imported Europeans loved the liberalization and importation of helots as leaf blowers, nannys … …

                Well that’s the thing. I feel at one point California did attract griller types. Like I read a book about the beach boys and the description of Hawthorne (where they were from). Here is the vibe I get of the place at the time:– disproportionately middle or even lower middle class– disproportionately white low church protestants– population was often less than a generation and at most two generations removed from agriculture in the border/plains states.– disproportionately employed in aerospaceI feel like that demo started leaving the state (and certainly stopped moving to the state ) as early as the 70s

        The Prigozhin event is a hard one to judge from the outside, especially as a non-Russian speaker not fully versed in the internal politics of Russia.  So one should be careful and very tentative about conclusions, especially when adding on the additional layer of fog of war…Rolo Slavsky has done an excellent job of focusing on Prigozhin over the past number of months, but he has become increasingly shrill and over-the-top lately.  Edward Slavsquatch is also very solid.That being said, Prigozhin’s aborted march on Moscow felt like Caesar crossing the Rubicon, saying “oops my bad”, then fleeing to Persia and leaving his troops to get absorbed by Rome.  Prigozhin’s advantages, like Caesar’s, were boldness and speed, which he erratically threw away after a day or two.  I would not be surprised if Prigozhin is defenestrated in the near or mid future; Russias criminal investigation into him is ongoing, and Shoigu apparently has not been forced out, so it looks like Prigozhin may not have won much of anything at all from this stunt…Regarding the Russia/Ukraine war itself, I think the whole war is fake, dictated on both sides by globohomo for ulterior goals: neofeudalreview.substack.com/p/how-real-is-the-russiaukraine-war

            Nothing fake about the war, its just hard to figure out everything, just the other day I watched a video on twitter of some Ukrainians trying to get out of a mine field, it was totally crazy. and for the last 3 weeks now the Ukrainian leaders keep driving their men right into Russian traps, how many tanks APCs will they lose to KA-52s before that change tactics, its madness
If you think Prigozhins antics are the result of mental collapse, then the lack of any coup attempt from the Ukrainian army is also a sign of madness IMO

                To clarify, the deaths on both sides are real.  There are huge casualties on both sides.  It is sad to hear about (I try not to watch the videos, and I definitely don’t cheer them). But the war is being managed by the same powers behind both sides to advance multi-faceted globohomo goals, and to them, white Christians who are genetic brethren killing each other by the hundreds of thousands is a good thing.  That is what I mean by the war being fake.

                    Casualties Ukraine to Russia are 10:1 by most reliable accounts. The Ukrainian people are pretty much irredeemable at this point. They have an easy way out, kill their leaders and their NATO advisors and lay down their arms and Russia will stop killing them. Easy, peace in one simple step.

                This has been a question i’ve had from the start. Why doesn’t some Ukranian put Zelensky in a wood chipper or something and take over? Seems like a golden opportunity to negotiate with Russians for help , get rid of the murderous gay elf killing off half your young men, and end up where you are going to end up anyway with the Russian speaking eastern regions as home ruled provinces at best or Russian protectorates. Long term  betting on GAE ZOG empire stability seems crazy. Why not follow the example of the Middle Eastern powers?

                    I should add that i know Zelensky is not really the decision maker but the point remains, round up him and his cabal and execute them all, preferably Kim Jong style, and negotiate something they can live with.

                    My suspicion is that a special detail of whatever American alphabet agency is in charge of stage managing President Stumbletoe and VP Cameltoe is handling Zelensky too. This means that the patriotic Ukrainians can’t get to him and his entourage to kill them because they spend all their time in a bunker in Langley, VA. When Zelensky needs to travel from Keeeeeeeeve to Berlin, let’s say, he’s actually on a 10-18 hour flight from Langley, Area 51, White Sands, or maybe even one of those places the Australians let us build in the outback.OK, so maybe it’s not quite THAT FnG, but you can bet it’s fake enough and ghey enough (and American enough) that the usual things people in violent, war torn countries do to deal with corrupt leaders are a couple orders of magnitude harder than they should be. Unfortunately for the Ukrainians this is not some banana Republic where the ruling generalissimo is fumbling the war effort against the neighboring mango Republic.

        “The usual suspects rushed out to post their fantasy version of what was happening as the events were unfolding. Many stated that they knew about this plot all along. Senior Kagan cult member Anne Applebaum had a narrative out on the first day. Note that her husband, a Polish diplomat, posted on Twitter about the Nord Stream bombing as it happened.”I view this response less as foreknowledge than as wish casting. The mad rush to claim this was then end of Putin and victory for Ukraine indicated an unexpected confirmation of the neocons’ wildest fantasies. Granted, there may have been assurances given that were withdrawn at the last minute ala the Bay of Pigs, but that seems highly unlikely since there have been no arrests, mass or otherwise.In a way, that is the scariest scenario. These psychopaths are playing literal Russian Roulette and putting the world at risk of nuclear annihilation. Yes, the grift and imperial impulses are strong, but we are seeing ad hoc madness at play here. This cannot end soon enough for my tastes. Putin surely realizes at this point that he is dealing with avaricious lunatics, and one false move on their part  and he will respond rationally, which to say the least is unpleasant for all of us.

            Eh.  To borrow the Zman’s skepticism on Putinism: how would you (or any of us) know, or how would anyone you read on the internet know, what the Russian secret police were doing in secret arrest raids on secret government facilities, all 4,000 miles away and in a completely incomprehensible language and alphabet? No one WOULD know if such were occurring.WHAT IF it was actually all a ruse to get the CIA to fund pudgy-face’s “coup” which he documents extensively, then he finks and turns over the recordings to the Kremlin to prove US involvement? What if…. it’s aliens [insert History Guy meme]?  It’s all rank speculation, and we won’t know for a while, perhaps decades, what’s actually going down somewhere between Red Square and Dzerzhinksy Square.

        I agree with Z-Man today and I will consider this validation of the posts I’ve written over the last couple of days. I don’t always carpet-bomb the internet with my pearls of wisdom, but in this case I think the issue was important enough to warrant a broad casting of bread upon the waters, so I cross-posted the same material to Moon of Alabama, Simplicius, Big Serge, Larry Johnson, and The Duran’s YouTube channel.I’m still looking for some way to email Alexander Mercouris directly. If anyone knows how to contact him, please let me know or please pass along the posts on my behalf. I would be very grateful.Now, being a “meta” sort of guy myself, I can’t help but be impressed by some of the metadata that is emerging from this whole incident. I am 100% certain that I’m right about what really happened with Prigozhin—that part was never in doubt. What’s curious is why everybody else is so wrong, because to me the whole thing seems fairly obvious.We all know what the mainstream media is about. We know that they have their narratives and that they function as a regime mouthpiece, and that they all move in lockstep as if guided by the same inner compass. But this is the first time that I can recall theALT-MEDIAdoing the same thing, all lurching at once towards the same constellation of wrong conclusions, parroting one another’s talking points and analysis and even prose styles, and doing it so quickly that one might be forgiven for wondering if they didn’t have prearranged boilerplate coming out of the teletype.Scott Ritter has the absolutely moronic idea that this was an honest-to-God coup attempt managed by Western intelligence. Larry Johnson follows on with the same notion and adds even more layers of 5D voodoo to the mix. Big Serge, along with The Duran boys, are content to chalk it all up to Prigozhin’s ego and business interests. This is especially disappointing coming from them, because The Duran more than anyone purports to actually have their finger on the pulse of the Russian street. So far, only the Z-Man has thought this through with any kind of clarity.The rest of these guys are simply talking their book. This marks a pivotal day in the history of the alt-media, for it is now clear that it is no longer the cutting edge of analysis and has become itself a mature franchise, wedded to the world as it is and highly provincial in its point of view. None of these guys stepped outside their occidental confines, projecting upon Prigozhin a very Western set of possible motives and behaviors. It is obvious now that they are not really capable of doing so, for this would have been a unique opportunity to demonstrate once and for all the conceptual limitations of the Western mainstream. This was the $100 bill on the sidewalk, and they missed it.From now on, the alt-media has to be regarded as a known quantity with limitations of its own. Just as the Covid debacle was a test of who really understood biology and Western bureaucratic overreach (washing out posers like Steve Sailer), and the Ukraine invasion was a test of who really understood geopolitics and the burgeoning multipolar world, so the Prigozhin Rebellion is a test of who really understands the Russian soul and the behaviors of battle-weary men of action.The squishy Alt-Right, for the most part, failed that test. It will never be the same again. They could not help but see in Progozhin’s actions some analogy to their own Western clown world, and this makes them unreliable outside that very circumscribed domain.

            You’ve failed to include Col McGregor in your comment.  Scott Ritter has crossed over into the Russian camp and is busy spending time over there pimping his Russian vanity book to their masses.  He is no longer credible as a knowledgeable, impartial observer.
If Putin steps up the war, then Col McGregor has called the event correctly.

                Scott Ritter has turned into a Pravda level Russian propagandist. He literally rants and raves about nuclear war.
Before he went nuts, I liked to watch his interviews of Russians to get the Russian perspective which is badly missing in the English press.  But I’ve always believed that the counterbalance to Western propaganda and misinformation was good information, not Russian propaganda.  Listening to warring propaganda just results in confusion.

                I agree with McGregor. Another person who has called this exactly right is none other thanPaul Craig Roberts.
I don’t ordinarily have much time for PCR, given his off-the-wall 9/11 Trutherism, but I just read his most recent 4 columns over at Unz (they are all about the Prigozhin situation), and I found nothing to disagree with.

            Well some sources said that the congressional intel committees were briefed about the coup last Tuesday.  So is it really out of the question that the West was sponsoring the plot?Also remember an IL22 intelligence gathering aircraft was shot down by the Wagners.   So that indicates they were serious.  Is it not possible that the Kagan cult actually deluded themselves into thinking that Russia was near civil war and all they had to do was activate their agent Prigozhin and some Wagners?   Is it possible that they thought most Russians would be behind the coup and then they found out differently?   After all the West deludes itself in all sorts of ways.

                The Left is totally deranged–yes, yes, I know. Just call me Captain Lord High Judge Obvious. On the one hand they have enough megalomania to think they are on the right side of history and that by slaughtering enough people, will convert the world to the holy cause of Perversity and Diversity and White Genocide. (That is an argument in favor of it believing Russia was a tinderbox of anti-Putin furor merely awaiting the match.) On the other, they’re convinced there’s a numberless army of white supremacists laying in the weeds awaiting the signal from Stilicho to arise and massacre the sainted negroes and Goodwhites.Cognitive dissonance is a polite term for their condition. Perpetual bipolar disorder may the more accurate one.

            It has been on my mind for a while that some percentage of the so called “alt media” has to be just as fake and controlled as regime media. It’s not as if the regime, which seeks information control and dominance over all media, would just shrug its shoulders and leave alt media be.

        this video(before the coup)https://t.me/vicktop55/15747+the fact that russian MoD issued order that wagner soldiers should sign contract with them before 1st of july
prove that Kremlin knew about this particular tribe’s member future attempt of going Lenin on Russia, so the j**w had to act quickly before he lost all of his soldiers.
That fact that his beef was with MoD suggests that j***s had not been able to infiltrate it. Russian MoD supporting Iran &amp; Syria is highly problematic for Israel &amp; .they need to grab hold of it, they also don’t wanna lose Khazaria to Russia.

                    Yeah, megalomania might be a bit far, but not by too much.
Btw, this trait is one of the reasons why Jews have been so incredibly successful. They take huge risks. Sometimes, it blows up in their fact; sometimes, it miraculously works and they end up billionaires and leading politicians.

            Zelensky is not Jewish. Anyone who converts to a different religion is not considered Jewish and can’t get  Israeli citizenship.Prigozhin qualifies for  Israeli citizenship as having 1 Jewish parent but is not Jewish since the mother isn’t (wasn’t). He can’t be buried in a Jewish cemetery without conversion to Judaism.Elvis Presley was Jewish, as his great grandmother was Jewish, she had a daughter, who in turn had a daughter who became Elvis’s mother.But Zelensky? Not Jewish. I just can’t find  out if he converted to Catholicism or Orthodox Christianity

        Eh. I don’t think the “coup” was much of anything. It was mostly projection and wishful thinking by the ZOG media. None of the talking heads know fuck-all about Prigozhin. Neither do I. But they were all acting like they were experts on him and this was some kind of important event for America and it controlled the narrative for a couple of days.Just a little bit of basic research on this dude and on Wagner indicates that they were sort of a Russian version of Blackwater. There was no way they were going to stage any coup and overthrow Putin any more than Erik Prince and Blackwater are going to overthrow Biden.Not. Gonna. Happen.

            Considering that Prigozhin had met with Putin a couple of times in the prior month, and that $6.2 billion had suddenly gone missing from the Pentagon, I don’t think we can rule out the possibility that this was staged, with Prigozhin double crossing the US/Ukraine…Putin also used it as an excuse to declare martial law, so highly beneficial to Putin anyway you look at it….

                I am sorry, but the missing money thing is nonsense. The DoD, last year, could not account for 1.5 trillion in assets. The idea that they had to do some chicanery to make a couple billions disappear is not within the bounds of belief.Writing that last sentence is kind of comical. Misappropriating a few billion dollars is unbelievable because they misappropriate trillions hehe

        Prigozhin seems to have considered himself a kind of Russian Ernst Rohm, with his paramilitary army and political aspirations. It appears he escaped Scarface Ernie’s fate, but the result is the same. His private army of thugs and criminals and his ambitions both collapsed, and Putin likely will receive the same support from the Russian “better sort” as Mustache Guy did from the German aristocracy when he removed Rohm and his SA as a threat. In both cases, I think that the man in power gave just enough rope to each to hang himself and in the process present the leader as the defender of the homeland from dangerous internal enemies.So a Russian soft Night of the Long Knives.

            But Wagner’s military achievements were substantial, with 50,000 troops defeating 46 Brigades of Ukrainian troops, maybe 150,000, and clearing out Bakhmut..And of course suffering many casualties, which were not suffered by the Russian army…

                Which is exactly why the regular Russian Army absolutely would want them disbanded. No serious nation state can allow a private army to operate side by side with the constituted, legitimate armed forces of that nation. That same dynamic is what pushed the German army to make a deal with Mustache Guy to eliminate the SA, who in 1934 actually outnumbered the Reichswehr. Prigozhin represents the bad old days of collapse and humiliation, where an ex-convict can turn himself into a warlord. The Russian generals are done with that time and dealing with guys like him now. The generals want to win this war with their soldiers, not shitbags like Wagner. Like Rohm, Prigozhin didn’t realize that the old days of chaos are over, and that his private army has outlived their usefulness.

                    I’m suspicious also, however from what a I’ve heard there were good reasons to have a “merc” army.  One of course was the immediate need for soldiers.  Another was the restriction on conscripts and combat duty outside the motherland.  The provinces were only later annexed as Russian territory. Finally, one precipitating cause of the brouhaha was Russia issuing “contracts” to the Wagner group—sign and become part of the official Russian command structure, or go home.

        Unfortunately, the whole affair will cement in the minds of the neocons that regime change is possible, even likely. That will be how they view it.

        RFJ Jr has a interview circulating wherein he talks about President Kennedy sending “advisors” to VietNam knowing they’d be in the fight, but when the American death count reached 75 he supposedly ordered the plug to be pulled on the whole operation.  (Then he was dead a month or so later).At some point, the Congress is going to have start demanding to know just how many  American troops are actually dying in Ukraine.  The hotel/barracks attack in Kramatorsk seems to be a targeted attack on NATO “mercenaries”.The Russians lost something like 10 million citizens during their Civil War between the Reds and the Whites in the early 1900’s.  Combined with the mop-up and implementation of communism afterwards, somewhere between 10-30% of the total population was wiped out.There’s a good chance the US just tried to foment another Civil War in Russia.  This is fun and games for chickenhawks like L. Graham or draft-proof-by-uterus privileged V. Nuland, but it’s deadly serious to the Russians.

        Prigozhin is basically a mobster who got too big for his britches.Best take on what happened, from Andrei Martyanov:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-SPBc_8GXwSee also his blogspot under “SmoothieX12”. Quoting:=======And now who doubted (I will name names) two days ago:US backs coup attempts whenever it can benefit – LavrovFSB is looking into this matter, but Vladimir Putin stated this clearly an hour ago:“They [the West and Ukraine] wanted Russian soldiers to kill each other, so that soldiers and civilians would die, so that in the end Russia would lose, and our society would break apart and choke on bloody civil strife,” the president said. “They rubbed their hands, dreaming of getting revenge for their failures at the front and during the so-called counteroffensive, but they miscalculated.”Wagner is kaput. The rest is history. Those who will decide to join Prigozhin (for now) in Belarus will live their remaining (not very long) lives in fear. When their end comes, they will know why and by who.========As to the rest, I watched Putin’s statements after, and in the 18+ years I’ve been paying attention to him, I have never seen him this angry. (Cold and controlled, but if you know him, you can see it.) But he values loyalty above all else.Patrick Lancaster was reporting live from Rostov-on-Don when the so-called coup rolled through, and it was nothing like you’ve heard. Party atmosphere, but of the sort that leaves clean streets behind.

        I have no intelligent suggestions, but I strongly suspect that a key to understand Putin’s behavior is that he considers Russia to be already in a full-on war against NATO. This means that he can’t just crush Ukraine and go home, because that wouldn’t end the war. He need to plan for the long game.

            Agreed. The Russia’s actions all along have been as though this is just the first stage in a long war – militarily, financially and diplomatically.
Total guess, but it seems as though Putin is trying to manage the war so as to never commit too many troops out of fear of getting hit by NATO in another theater. As long as his military stays balanced, NATO can’t attack. So, he slow grinds Ukraine will building his military and holding it back, both to prepare for the real enemy and to prevent NATO from attacking.

                The Germans did it to Russia using bolshevics. It is a tried and true strategy. If he is behind it (which I doubt since it’s been going on for decades) maybe the West should not have put him in a position where he felt he needed to.
Still, not our guy. But he is opposing our enemy at the moment.

        I also don’t know the real dynamics and I too speculate. Prigozhin seems to have been a mix of thug and buffoon his whole life. He was behind bars as a career criminal when the Soviet Union imploded. He has never been a professional soldier. Prigozhin and his Wagner Group — composed of men from Russian jails and hence expendable cannon fodder — have been convenient instruments for Putin and he has been prepared to overlook Prigozhin’s bluster and bravado.
This was not a serious coup attempt. Prigozhin was not Caesar crossing the Rubicon.

            Most of the Wagner fighters are just former soldiers. The whole prison thing was an expediency allowed un the Donbas. Wagner recruited fighters from the local jails, not Russian jails. That said, Russia has the same traditions in this regard as the West. That is, one way out of prison for low-level offenders is to join the military. You get caught with drugs you can join the military or go to prison. This used to be common in the United States.That said, I do think the Kremlin was happy to use Wagner as shock troops in order to preserve the regular army in places like Bakhmut and earlier in Mariupol. With the buildup over the last six months, Wagner has lost its usefulness in that regard, so the Kremlin will repurpose it. My guess is they have created a successor company or companies with new owners who will then be tasked with various jobs for which a PMC is suited.As far as Prigozhin, I said a few months ago that he was showing signs of battle fatigue. The guy has been right there on the front lines. Seeing men he personally recruited get maimed and killed has to take a toll. Plus, he is an old man and the ability to accept death of young people declines with age. His increasingly erratic statements suggested to me that he was struggling to maintain is sanity. The light touch by the Kremlin would fit that scenario.

                Prigozhin is probably genuinely angry about the dovish policy towards Ukraine.  He blames the war minister to avoid attacking Putin.  This anger has got him unhinged.

                Z  – you are right on. I believe too many ignore that this guy was on the front lines for a year. That would take a toll on anyone, much less an older guy who had never experienced such combat. I think we should remember that he had been off the front line for around a month(I am assuming). A year of non stop stress and death, and then the sudden cease with no time for decompression (such as the long trips home ik ww1 and 2 for us vets). A recipe for paranoid restlessness.

                Seems the SS with its Totenkopf did not think so at the time, albeit the Wagner logo looks a lot like a biker patch.  See Hell’s Angels.

                GB? Nah mate. In the long list of warmongering countries, I’d put GB somewhere between Spain and Sweden.GB was largely a defensive power that won, by pluck and luck and “the playing-fields of Eton” against far more aggressive powers like the Spaniards, the French, and the Germans. Only by the 19th century did they decide they wanted to seem like a bestriding world power.But they weren’t really. They just showed up in long-declined dysfunctional third-world countries and said, “Cheerio. We’re terribly afraid that we must assume your government for the Crown. And you shan’t resist, or I daresay there will be a nasty business.” They just took what they could get, for mercantilist purposes. Not unlike what China is doing now.I imagine a “warmongering” power is a country that just inserts itself everywhere it can, and starts pointless wars, and scares the hell out of everyone, and makes smoldering examples of small countries that resist. Now which country is doing that kind of thing now? I wonder…
