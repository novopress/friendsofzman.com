        […] When adults begin to subject children to this lunacy, we’re talking about child abuse. The demented woman claiming her boy child is female is just trying to get attention for herself at the expense of her child. The poor kid will end up needing years of therapy to overcome what his mother has done to him, in addition to having to deal with the bad genes he inherited from this nut. Here… […]

        When the Boy Scouts caved in to the demands of the gay mafia and the Progressives and abandoned what they had once stood for, I thought that it probably meant the organizations end after over a century.   For the Progs would not leave them alone until all traces of traditional American values were wiped from the organization.   And their old friends and supporters would turn away increasingly as they changed.And when the Progs were finished, they would toss their “toy” onto the trash heap.  By then, what parent would send their child to either the Boy or Girl Scouts?Pendulum swinging back yet?

        I am already so sick of the whole transgender thing. Where did all these transgender beings come from all of a sudden? I don’t recall any talk or awareness of “transgenderism” until about 3 or so years ago. Before that everyone just called it cross-dressing, and it was pretty darn rare. Can we go back to those days, please?

        Once, ’round a holiday family dinner table, I got into an argument with a cousin who stated that homosexuality was “normal”. I (ignoring my wife’s shin kicks under the table) replied that being gay certainly isn’t “normal” under any reasonable definition of the word. My argument was, and is, that the most basic biological imperative of any species is self-propagation. Homosexuality is in direct opposition to this. I continued, noting that I was willing to allow that being gay was “natural”…like, say, disease and birth defects.
We don’t really discuss social/political issues at those occasions anymore.

        One of my (insane) kids—at the age of four—insisted that he be called “Fred Flintstone.”  He called his mother Wilma (a bit of an Oedipal problem there) and the dog, Barney.  He was over it by the time he was in high school.
His (equally deranged) brother said that he was Spiderman,  Wore the mask for about a year.  When it finally rotted away, revealing a face full of fungus, he decided to be Fred Flintstone.
The $hit just never stops around here.  Oops, gotta run.  Date with Minnie.
