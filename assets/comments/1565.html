        Actually Diversity Street exemplifies Natural Selection. What is being selected for at all times and everywhere is differential reproductive success. Any trait that lets someone have a larger number of children reach adulthood than one’s neighbor means that that trait becomes relatively more common in the next generation.
Things like intelligence, strength, industry, altruism are only selected for if they result in more children relative one’s competitors. The current welfare state does not prize these characters and even seems to favor violent, stupid parasites. So we evolve in that direction.

            I agree, but I was thinking down stream a few generations. Plain arithmetic says Diversity Street has a natural limit. It’s like every east coast city having one Malcolm X Boulevard and one Martin Luther King Boulevard. If both are a few blocks long and dead end at the extremes, the city can survive. if both become major arteries, the city dies.That said I think you are correct in the long run. The road we’re on leads to a mass extinction even when the check writing portion of society stops writing the checks. The check cashing portion suddenly runs out of food.
