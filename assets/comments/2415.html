        Nearly a week now since the world collapsed around the commies ears and I’m still as happy as hell, moments like this don’t happen often.

        The Tory win with the attraction of the UKIP plank appears to be an example of the “center of gravity” theory of politics, i.e. when you have two equally balanced groups (let’s say A &amp; B), adding another to the extreme far side of one (B) pulls the center towards them (B).Or something. The important thing to remember is that immutable laws of politics seldom work twice.

        Allow me to speak from among it all. I went along on May 7 to vote for UKIP (and did) because as a lad from a working class family — though I was born in a steel-making city and am eternally grateful I had other opportunities which meant I didn’t have to deal with pouring molten metal — I am able to recognise that my national and regional identity (I often joke about my tribal origins from 1200 years ago) matter to me.I was under no illusion that UKIP would win, particularly where I live. My area is a staunch Labour stronghold which still resents the fact that Thatcher closed some pits in the 80s but carefully avoids remembering that a Labour administration in the 70s closed far, far more. But such is the memory of people. Labour, in my patch, got back in as expected. That will take long time to change and this election wasn’t any sort of turning point in that respect.There is however a turning in the air. People do not want immigration. They don’t even care if people are poor elsewhere. Traditionally we give to charity to help them make their lives in some distant shithole better, not invite them here to show us how shitty it is close up. Nationally, the movement towards protecting what we have was strong but, the way the UK election system works, it meant that a lot of people though unhappy with unfettered immigration didn’t really get what they wanted, which is was a strong attitude and firm approach towards Euro socialism. Many listened to what Farage said and he didn’t talk about ‘A Fairer Society’ but about what is actually happening. as you can imagine this made him unpopular with the media, who are gayly dancing to the left. Farage said we treat more foreigners for HIV than Brits, but that angered the left (especially Plaid Cymru for some odd reason) and his contention that we should have a National health service rather than an International health service struck a chord with many but didn’t deter the left — which turned out to be everyone but UKIP because the Tories once again were pretty sure they would need a coalition with the left-leaning Lib Dems to carry on — from bleating about making equality central to everyone’s lives wherever they live. Most people don’t care about equality: I used to live in Rotherham and trust me, the whites there dislike the muslim ‘invasion’ as they see it. I have seen women in full burqas driving erratically and I feared for my life, and I once had a muslim male spit at me on the street for no reason. People don’t like those who aren’t like them, no matter how much propaganda we get from the fat culturalists in remote London.The issue in the UK was, despite all the commentators clap trap, about what is real. Money and security (personal and national) is more real than airy-fairy ideals and fashionable dogma. Labour elected as leader a man who came across badly and while politics shouldn’t be about looks, the hopelessness of Ed Miliband was all too apparent. Labour’s record in 13 years of government, despite being lauded by the BBC, utterly destructive in all sorts of ways, and immigration was one of them. A lot of Labour supporters have seen their jobs go, their security threatened and their world changed by edicts on high. It is one thing to go on vacation to Turkey but quite another to have Turks living on your street. Thanks to Labour’s devious ways  the people of the UK had to give up the former but accept the latter. That made a lot of Labour voters who couldn’t bring themselves to vote Tory choose to vote for UKIP. At least the candidates were people like themselves, however weird some of them might have been.The voters could be sure they weren’t oily as well as weird, as they saw down in London.Labour’s desperation meant that they would get into bed with anyone who would give them power. The Scots were the best bet for Miliband to get into No 10 but the English didn’t like the idea of the wild socialism they saw north of the border coming south. Actually, we never have much wanted them south of the wall. The Scots despise the English, and maybe with good reason but we Englsih still remember the damage that Scots like Brown and Darling have done to this nation. I always tell people I am a Yorkshireman first and an Englishman second, but the Englishman in me didn’t like the idea of Sturgeon having power in Westminster and shaping my life when all her loyalties lie north of the border.So Labour shot itself in the foot, and in the leg and eventually in the head. I have no doubt they will bounce back in some way but the Party Of The Working Class took away the Work and they will have to reinvent themselves as something other than Taxing and Squandering.I expect Cameron, feeble oaf that he is, was greatly heartened to gain a real, Tory-only majority. Not many people here are sure about the conservatives love of the EU but he promised referendum if he won and that may mean something will change about how Brussels — sorry, I mean Berlin — rules us. We shall have to see on that.I have a relative who lives in London and was, by all accounts, in tears when the news came through that her wonderful socialist paradise would have to be postponed. But I could have told her that essentially, the English are cautious and conservative. They would always, given the chance, vote for better for themselves but not too much change. Progressive ideas might warm the odd dinner party in London but the people elsewhere don’t share them. Calls for ‘A Fairer Society’ was seen as so much hot air, especially when that fairness meant that the food on your table has to Halal and you wake each morning to an Arabic call to prayers.An Englishman’s home is his castle, and castles were built to keep the invaders at bay.People here are essentially conservative. Maybe not always Conservative, but one thing is certain: the left will never admit it and thus they will never get very far when it comes to the real world.

        Like it or not, most of us trace our ancestors back to Ellis Island. That’s an important emotional piece of how many people think about immigration.

        The next Labour leader is a black African named Chuka Umama or something like it.
The things will start to unravel in Europe and maybe the US in the next five years, my prediction is that between 2020-2030 the demographic shift will finally have a political impact in the big European countries.
