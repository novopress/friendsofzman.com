        It’s possible that we’re just seeing a mass Democrat panic. Let’s pretend for a moment that we aren’t ruled by evil people. Just people who think their life isEntourageexcept most of them think and act like Ari Gold.Maybe Occam’s razor applies, and divine intervention is not that Trump is alive, but the Dems are imploding and the regime narrative is falling apart.This is God at work: Biden reveals to the world how incapacitated he is. Then some weirdo gets off shots at Trump because of progressive-era girl-boss incompetence, then Trump survives and takes a lion’s pose for the ages. Then enters triumphantly into the RNC convention without a whiff of drama, only unity and energy. Then Biden falls ill to whatever he’s got, and his closest advisors must have seen something horrible. (Remember in one of his last videos Biden was trying to move in on a woman not his wife.) Then Ari Gold-level scrambling begins. They do ham-fisted moves and nobody under 65 believes anything coming out of Washington.This is God at work. No matter who wins in November, this is the beginning of the end of the Regime.

            Or at the very least, a reversal of the progressive lunacy that began in Obama’s second term.

                Definitely. No matter how loud the captive media shout, most people around the West are sick to the back teeth of Wokeism and incompetent lefties.

            I do think that the assassination attempt was aresponseto the debate, they knew Biden had to go, they knew nobody likes Kamala and she is a horrible politician, so they figured that injecting chaos into the RNC side would help them out (and, yea, Kamala might be a better option than “Nikki” Haley). It didn’t work, so the Brandon entity decides that if Trump isn’t going then he isn’t going either (which is actually logical from a certain point of view), so they need to take out Biden, so they commit the palace coup.Of course, they used a stock Word template, didn’t use the Presidential seal, and forged his signature badly. I am sure somebody involved in the coup said that not using the seal insulates them in some way because of some convoluted legal argument, but in the end, if you’re committing treason, you’re committing treason. These are not smart people, they are power mad lunatics used to thinking that their word shapes the world.

This is perceptive insight, Mycale, that answers a few baffling but critical questions. Nice job.

                Yep. The timeline sure is interesting, isn’t it?
June 27: Biden botches the debate.July 13: Trump gets shotJuly 21: Biden quits
Translation: they knew Biden couldn’t beat Trump, so they had Trump shot. When Trump survived the shooting they had to get rid of Biden.
The implication of course is that they would have continued to run the Biden corpse if Trump had been killed…

                    If Trump had been killed, they could have stashed Joe in his basement for the next four months because the GOP would be, understandably, in total disarray. They probably would have handed the nomination to Nimrata but as you know, everyone except hardcore Zionists and warmongers hate her. Provided Biden was alive, he could have passed the office to Kamala on January 21.For a long time I wondered why Nimrata was so insistent on staying in the race. I figured that someone told her that Trump as going to be out of the picture one way or the other. I figured it was because of the lawfare, but now I know they had other ideas. Maybe they still do.

                Assassination was always going to happen next.  The SCOTUS immunity ruling and Judge Cannon ruling that Jack Smith has no legal authority forced things to the next, obvious, tactic: assassination.  They have been walking slowly and inexorably to assassination since 2015.I suspect Biden knew about it.  He hinted at it a few times.  They have to keep him on a short short leash now because people who quit their jobs 6 months in advance, but remain at work, are major security risks.  They’ll pop off, leak secrets, start fights, etc.Biden didn’t write the letter.  It was transmitted by the coup plotters.  If it were to come out that Biden didn’t send it, it just proves he’s incapable of holding the office.  He and the family have no choice but to go along with it.Harris is disposable.  She’s useful if she somehow gets enough real votes to make the fake ones easy to hide.  If she loses, she’s a moron and easily discarded.  And the ideologues can pretend their agenda is popular, it was just a bad candidate.

                Let’s just suppose that Biden really is too sick to appear in public and that he voluntarily agreed to bow out of the race. If that were the case, why not just wait until he has recovered enough to make the announcement himself? Doing so would obviate the vast majority of suspicion that is in the air right now, not to mention the violence being done to the Power Structure’s legitimacy.Of course, the powers behind the throne may have concluded that the public is too stupid and gullible to question any official narrative, so why does it matter what they do? Alas, they may be correct in that regard.

I suspect that due to the nature of his ailments he may be unable to recover. Dementia, maybe stroke, heart trouble.

        Even in his vegetative state, Joe Biden is smarter than Kamala Harris.
Pure genius.
Sometime soon, Biden must make anappearanceor step down from office.
Why? What would be the consequence if he did not? Also, if there even were a theoretical consequence, who would enforce it? The lesson of the Biden nightmare has been politicians have no actual power and have as much agency as the endangered retail store mannequins, and it is even worse than we thought. The Soviet Union was an open society by comparison.

            This. People on our side of the divide knew that politicians have no real power, even Trump couldn’t defeat the managerial class and Deep State. Now, the world is beginning to see it as well.
As a result, even Trump winning won’t impact Deep State and the managerial class much. To quote Pitch Meeting guy, it’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

                I suspect Trump wins because the Deep State finally has realized it can co-opt him. This has been glaringly obvious for almost a decade but the Regime is about as stupid as it is ruthless these days. It spares me the trouble of impotently voting, at least. Like the house, the Regime always wins despite its intellectual shortcomings. It kind of didn’t win outright in 2016 and went insane, but one of the less dim bulbs had a Eureka moment and all is well now at least as far as puppetry goes.

                    I started to change my mind on who would win the election over the winter when the anti-genocide protests were going on. Sure, the Dem leadership was 100% on board Israel killing Palestinians at will in the hopes of ethnically cleansing them from Gaza, but they were having a hard time with their base.
The GOP leadership, its base and Trump, however, were all on Team Israel. All of the sudden, Trump’s odd went way up.

                        Recent JD Vance statements on Israel support this contention. Note Kamala will not attend the Bibi fundraiser, which means her check will be mailed surreptitiously. The Coalition of the Ascendant is quite fragile, but as long as Tribal money flows, that doesn’t matter.

                            The Jews have painted themselves into a corner. Non-whites just don’t like Jews or Israel, but Jews hate being on Team Whitey.As to Vance, I continue to wonder if he’s playing the long game. He’s tied into emerging, (mostly) non-Jewish power bases – Silicon Valley and the Indians. I don’t believe that he, Vivek and other up and comers are satisfied being just the help that serve the Kosher dinner table.I think that they want more but understand that it will take time to build a power base that can compete so they bid their time and work with the current rulers. I could be wrong for sure, and neither base cares about my people, but it’s still an interesting development.

                                Vance indeed is an opportunist. He’s terrifying and hostile to us but his opportunism means he can be co-opted by emerging elites somewhat more sympathetic to our people. Kosher America will be done in the near term, I think. It is not a given at all this will make things better, of course, but it is possible.

                                The clock is ticking on American diehard support for Israel. The future BIPOC America will side with the Palestinians (already is). Jews shot themselves in the foot by throwing open our borders to the Third World. For now they are still in power, but they are struggling to keep a lid on the pro-Palestinian diversity crowd. And who’s defending Israel? White countries. Without Europe and America, the whole Islamic world would be marching on Jerusalem.

                                “… it will take time to build a power base …”The Republic died in 1861 leading to the 1rst American Empire, defined as rule by WASP merchants through fake democracy where the constitution was suspended at will when inconvenient. (Damn you to eternal hell, Lincoln and Wilson.) This was then conquered from within by Jewish merchants seizing control over the critical currency infrastructure by the late 1960’s, ushering in the 2nd American Empire.Pres. Trump is attempting to unseat Jewish control by building yet another merchant coalition (the only way to compete for power in a liberal democracy) comprised of multiethnic imperial provincials. He is trying to transition to a 3rd American Empire. This is much like Rome near its end when it had a multiethnic ruling class of imperial provincials after the ethnic Roman ruling class destroyed itself with corruption.The Heritage-American MAGA working class are in no way, shape, or form part of this nascent would-be ruling class, but merely the vehicle for which the would-be replacement ruling class seizes power over the institutions of authority. Heritage-American interests differ sharply with the nascent 3rd American Empire merchant ruling class. They still want cheap labor, but want it done through rule of law where they are in control. I’d rather see the competing ruling classes of the 2nd and rising 3rd American Empire destroy each other so that we have a chance to restore a European Republic. If we can get mass deportation out of the 3rd AE ruling class, then it will be worth the short term collaboration.

                        Pity the situation of the Zionist cheerleaders of either party: surely it’s likely that a lot of the Pro-Palestine protests were being funded or directed by anti-Israel interests. Yet the uncomfortable fact remains Israel was (still is?) doing quite a bit of killing of civilians, leveling entire cities and such. Whatever justification the Jews may have had after being attacked they clearly have killed more of the enemy than casualties they took in the Palestinian Paraglider Penetration. Leaving aside the accusation of  whether or not it’s “genocide,” it’s definitely bad optics for the vast majority of the world who are not in awe of The Tribe. The hugely lopsided response surely has not gone unnoticed, even to Joe Sixpack.

                    I suspect Trump wins because the Deep State finally has realized it can co-opt him.
Since day one, Trump has begged them, on his bended knees, to forgive him for winning in 2016.
They will never do that, of course, but realizing that Trump is now the only game in town, they gritted their teeth and started to pick up the phone when he called.

                            As an aside, how many coups are possible in a five-year period?
Coups seem to poll well with the audience, so they’ll probably keep putting them in the script.
It’s understood they’re all just actors, so we might as well have some quality entertainment. And now, when politicians can be generated by AI, there’s no reason not to have a presidential assassination every week.

            This is like the Post-WWI days of Woodrow Wilson’s Second Wife Edith Wilson running things for something like a year and a half while the President was an invalid from a stroke. They’re pictured together with him supposedly signing a document while she lovingly looks over his shoulder. Hah!Dems sure lead unhealthy lifestyles as a few years later you had President Franklin Delano Roosevelt unable to walk because of polio, although never pictured in a wheelchair and his walking, with crutches was accomplished by the strength of his upper body using the crutches to rock his steel-girded legs from side to side. Media silence on that one, too, for several decades, and that wasn’t ALL that was wrong with FDR’s health! See the great new book by Steven Lomazow M.D.,FDR Unmasked. Horrible how we citizens are manipulated.

        I came into the office this morning and overheard everyone discussing openly whether Biden is dead or not.  I have no idea what their politics are, but I suspect that many of them lean left or are pretty apolitical overall.  It’s kind of remarkable though that we’ve come to a point where your typical middle-of-the-road American simply assumes that the government is probably lying about even the most important subjects.

All the brittle, aging party hacks that have never done anything but commissar up through the party machine, the pravda press that only exists to legitimize the regime, and the palace intrigue of which faction of the left can bash their friends’ heads to pulp in just the right way to assume power, but not let on that the whole game is solely for their personal benefit.

            Said it a million times.You can hate Nancy Pelosi, you can mock her, you can throw rude hand gestures at her, but at the end of the day,  you’d better not underestimate her.She’s probably one of the most terrifyingly effective Democratic Party leaders in my lifetime. You do not want to cross this broad…especially if you’re a democrat.  Raw, naked power.  It’s not like what we were taught in schoolhouse rock.(Mitch McConnel used to be like this.  More of a iron fist in a velvet glove.  I don’t think Team R has anyone like this anymore, and it shows.)

                Since Harris has Pelosi’s imprimatur, it signals to me that Harris has the approval of the Democratic establishment. Now all she needs is incumbency, which could be arranged easily now that Biden has Covid. A shot of Versed, a death certificate signed by one of the docs who have assured us for years that Biden was healthy and voila: President Harris. She heroically steps into the office to save the country after the tragic demise of President Biden.

        A disquieting thought: It’s hardly a stretch to fear that virtually every government utterance is, or at least must reasonably be suspected, of being a lie in whole or in part. This is perhaps most painfully obvious with flying-by-the-seat-of-the-pants whoppers tweeted by Biden’s minders. Yet it’s been a problem for decades even with what that naïve might believe were routine things like government economic statistics or the approval of the safety of a new vaccine that would soon be mandated upon millions of hapless citizens. If the government may be fudging the money supply figures from last quarter, or the recent unemployment figures, how much more so will they dip into the well of untruth when the crisis du jour requires military-grade disinformation?What might be less obvious at first glance is that perpetual lying has always been the stock in trade of the intelligence agencies. These folks like to be out of the public eye of course, yet one notes that the occasional public figure who dares criticize them often will remark that not one of their statements can be taken as the truth. It’s as if the spooks are constitutionally incapable of admitting a single fact, even the most obvious like the sky is blue or that it’s dark at night. The jaded cynic might note that such blanket prevarication seems to have spread to the entire government. It’s only a short logical jump to assume that the spooks, the Deep State, or at least their “morality”, have completely taken over all branches of government and much else besides.Paraphrasing what Z has said lately: You simply cannot accept any information as very reliable any more. Feel free to make up your own wild theory, conspiracy theory though it may be. It’s likely to be a more plausible explanation of events than what the media will claim.

            You simply cannot accept any information as very reliable any more.You’re right, Ben.Anything related to politics or that common sense cannot verify, ought to be thrown in the dustbin. The only information dissidents need be concerned with are our immediate inputs from our immediate environments.At best, Regime Media (and most other media) ought to be treated as an amusement (even though their goals are evil and, in fact, deadly serious).Technical information that needs to be correct, for example, on correctly operating a boiler, or how to use a CNC mill, or how to preserve foodstuffs; can of course still be relied on. It is a simple thing to demonstrate that faulty information in these cases is faulty.But, as we all know here, anything related to “The Big Lies” that comes from the state (and the mouths of Leftists), must never be trusted.It’s fine to admit we don’t know. We know where the evil is, and from whom it comes. And that’s enough.

            I’ve dealt with a couple of pathological liars in my personal life. Eventually, the only thing you can do is disassociate. There’s no other way. Which in this context of our government means expatriation. Otherwise, we’re just left to discuss it amongst ourselves. Wish. Hope. Cope. But I’m starting to question their staying power, and just a year or two ago I wasn’t so much. So maybe I can outlast them.

        Another possibility is that Biden is not even sick, let alone catatonic or dead. Rather, the Power Structure put to him an ultimatum that he must drop out of the race or, if he refused, there would be consequences. Biden refused–which is in keeping with his mule-headed and megalomaniacal character–and is now under house arrest getting the treatment until he sees sense. And, if he doesn’t capitulate at some point he will be killed by “Covid.”

                Barnes got famous being Alex Jones’s lawyer, back when Jones didn’t always lose. He’s a “character,” great interview, does a decent talk show with a crazy Jew.
How he decides who and what is or isn’t Deep State™ (derogatory) is incomprehensible, and his faith in the law (at this late date) is a great character flaw. His theory of the Trump shooting is likely correct (enough) but he’s weirdly defensive of some who’ve benefited from it.
One of those guys, y’know?

                    When I think of Robert Barnes, I think of when Nick Fuentes debated him several years ago, as a very young man (21-22?) on the subject of Israel.  It went very badly for Barnes who was, and I suppose still is, a stereotypical boomer conserva-tard who loves Israel.

        I just read a report that rapper Snoop Dogg is going to carry the Olympic torch in Paris just before it enters the stadium.  Instead of honoring great athletes they are honoring an aging rapper best known for smoking dope.  Maybe it is far outliving the rapper life expectancy.  Once upon a time, the Olympics was a big deal and the regime could have used it to distract from the Weekend at Bernie’s scam they are running with Biden.  Now it is as dysfunctional as the rest of the regime and people are only tuning in casually if at all.The media is treating has been actor George Clooney as if he is a major player in the Democratic Party and given the insane state of the party he might be.  We are seeing decline across the regime, the competence crisis is getting impossible for people to ignore.  When does the bottom fall out of this?https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40622563/snoop-dogg-carry-olympic-torch-ahead-paris-opening-ceremony

                They may as well play the unedited bits of that album, “The Chronic.” Most of that album is horrific cussing, talking about women as if they are nothing but holes, and almost constant spewing of extremely lewd denigration of homosexuals.
It would be the perfect symbol of The Regime and how it applies its morality and to whom.

            They’re already pretending. Most human beings repeat what they are told is the most popular thing to repeat. This is 99% of our waking life. But what theyknoworsuspectis repressed if there is a price to be paid for expressing it consciously to themselves or vocally to others. Moreover, we have a vicious competitive instinct in the US (we’re not alone in this, yes, I know) which for most prevents the slightest de-escalation in verbal confrontation at this stage in our history, because to concede anything to Trump is to concede a fondness for fascism in the eyes of those around you. Both of these dynamics are foremost in American society today in sociological settings (the workplace, clubs, associations, friendships, etc.).For nine years these people have pretended that Trump is Hitler, Putin controls the US, and Nazis are about to run the US and put women in breeding camps. Theysenseat an instinctual level that this isnottrue. That is why so few of them actually engage in any violence or resistance (I’m talking about your average shitlib here). In blue states you can have abortions every nine months and have a party thrown in your honor when you do. You are rewarded at work for expressing Trump hatred and anti-white hatred. At some level, these people do understand that what they claim is happening to them is not, in fact, happening to them. Why? Because their bodies tell them it is not. Their minds, however, are racing like somebody who’s been under JJ Angleton’s Homemade Panacea Syrup for a decade, though.But they cannot climb down from these positions without further advancing — perhaps to terminal fracture — their already-precarious state of psychological brittleness and amorphous sense of self. As someone raised in a violent household and a father raised by, well, a criminal, I am very concerned about the way these private dynamics will begin to germinate in the dynamics of everyday life, and soon.

            I’ve been joking for 4 years that the real fake-out is that Biden died on the campaign trail in 2019. Everyone who has talked to “Biden” since then has been meeting one of string of actors coached in portraying a particular not-too-bright crazy old man with anger issues. No, I don’t really believe this of course but since we’re making wishes…

        When the Chicago police were beating the daylights out of the hippies in 1968, the long-hairs were chanting ‘the whole world is watching’. Whatever the case then, it’s certainly true now. The whole world really *is* watching. And judging. If this had all been scripted by Chris Chan, its sinister wackiness could hardly have been more exaggerated.
Why would you want to use the dollar in these circumstances? Why would you choose to invest in or make yourself dependant on people who are 8 year-olds stuck in the bodies of 58 year olds?

        I have one of those stupid aggregation sites set to my homepage on one of my devices and they are already rolling out the low tier “Kamala has this one strength that may trigger Trump” and “I’m a BLACK woman. Here is why Kamala’s candidacy is so inspiring” articles. I know these articles aren’t hard to write – hell I am not even sure a human is writing them these days – but it is like this was all planned in advance .Also worth noting this is the third primary in a row where the DNC elites stepped in and rigged the process to defy the will of the voters. The last time they had a primary where the actual Democrat voters had their say, really, was 2008, and that was when the voters openly defied the will of the Democrat elite and picked Obama over Hillary. I know that they managed to smoothly integrate Obama into their power structure, but it also seems like they made a decision to never, ever let that happen again.

Seriously, it must be frightening to be one of those hacks who writes for Huffpo, or Jezebel, or the dozens of clones of those. They’re probably all firing their teams of White Karens and hiring every imaginable DEI persyn they can find. The actual writing will be done by AI and the publication gets all kind of diversity cred because the new “writers” are rainbow-hued knuckle heads who work for whatever wage you need to pay a ghetto kid that beats what he can earn at McDonald’s or peddling dope.

            Democratic voterslovethat their party’s primaries are rigged against them. If there exists a wise mind behind the current “palace intrigue,” he knows that chucking Biden off the train in a way that’s blatantly unjust—preferably cruel and criminal—and installing Kamala against the voters’ will is going to greatly increase those same voters’ enthusiasm. This istheway for them to turn out enough votes to make The Steal 2 seem “plausible,” if that’s the plan. (It’s one of the plans, apparently. Or it’s just busywork for their idiots.)Typically you see libs’ love of The West Wing and similar political dramas attributed to their being “idealistic” about or guilelessly admiring of politicians. Not exactly. What they want iscorruption they can see,government as in-your-face conspiracy against the people. The Democrats are the party of that.

                Based on how things transpired since the palace coup, you certainly appear to be onto something. The shills on X.com pivoted instantly from “Biden is our guy, we need to rally behind him” to “Kamala is our gal, we need to rally behind her” within minutes of the coup being publicized. The speed with which this entire shitlib operation pivoted and then kicked Biden to the curb actually surprised me. And as you point out, they seem far more enthusiastic about the entire operation now (see the shill articles I mentioned).I still think, in the long run, a party that constantly works in defiance of the people it purports to represent cannot last, but who knows the timeline of that?

        If people would simply use their heads and not look at the images they would grasp in a short amount of time that someone affiliated with Biden tried to remove Trump, and failed. Now the team of people involved in that operation are being removed by another faction using that failure as leverage.
Whether the next team is competent, or evil, or stupid or whatever psychological state they currently live in, is irrelevant.
I honestly cannot understand why the thing right in front of us is of no importance in this discussion.

        A key (and advantageous) factor in any  Dem gameplan going forward is that their vaunted “intelligent” and “educated” voters will eagerly and docilely buy into whatever narrative is presented to them.I always knew this to be true; but I underestimated how rapidly they can turn on a dime to embrace contradictory narratives—and then *defend* each position as if it’s a religious dogma. In the past month, I’ve seen the lefties in my circle—mostly normies of one stripe or another—excitedly advance at least eight distinct lines of “reasoning,” with no regard for their internal consistency:(1) Biden is our guy and the best man to go against Trump; (2) Biden was clearly addled in the debate and will lose to Trump unless he steps aside; (3) Biden merely had a bad night in the debate, and anyway how alert do you have to be to serve as president?; (4) Biden’s a tough guy who won’t back down to the naysayers, Yea Biden!; (5) Biden should heed important voices like George Clooney who express doubts about his ability to defeat Trump; (6) Biden is a legendary statesman, a pinnacle figure of US history, who places the good of the country above his personal ambition; (7) Kamala is the anointed and super-smart successor to the great and moral Biden, and we should rally round; (8) Biden withdrew his candidacy and hasn’t been seen in several days: What’s so strange about that?It is an incredible advantage in a democracy to have a voting base so obedient, pliant, and unquestioning; so eager to forget yesterday’s history. To adopt my favorite Zman observation: “It’s always Day One with these people.”And it must be a great assurance to the Dem powers and principalities to know that they can offer any alibi, pull any shenanigan, and these tractableminions of the Lizard King will obediently accept it and do what they’re told. They can rally round Harris today, throw her on the ash heap tomorrow, replace the entire ticket the day before the election—and it will be “No questions asked” among the political institutions, media, universities, and electorate.This is one of the reasons I am not terribly optimistic about the outcome of the election (if it even matters), even considering the fact that Trump appears to have the Mandate of Heaven.

but I still think it’s just a test run. If she doesn’t poll well enough, they’ll give the nomination to someone else (you know who). And the NPC software will update yet again.

                My YouTube “news” shorts last night were an echo chamber of “Kamala gains support among Democrats”, like it’s a surprise or like they had anyone else to back. It reminded me of the day during the Coof panic when all 5 of the slots in my feed for that had the same photo of Biden. Someone big has come down from the mountain and handed them the Kamala Tablets.

        So this entire situation is a Giant Steaming Bowl 🥣 of “Not Good”Looking at the options, Joe Biden:May be deadMay be in hospice / at death’s doorMay have suffered a stroke and cannot speak or slurs his words even worse than normalHas declined mentally and physically so much that any drugs they were giving him no longer have any effectIs being coached to give a fifteen minute press conference to allay fears and it’s taking much longer than normal to get him to that point.So of course let’s put Kamala out there to campaign while not answering:Is Joe alive?If 1. Is yes, then what is his physical and mental health?If 2. Indicates he is not mentally stable and competent, why is he still President?We’ve hit Peak Soviet Union here haven’t we?

        I wish a world leader like Xi or Lula would just call the whitehouse, politely ask to speak to the president on an important and urgent matter… while live streaming the call. What would the hacks come up with? “So sorry, the president is on the toilet. No I’m afraid it will take a rather long time. No he doesn’t like to speak on the phone while he’s sitting on the toilet. Might take a long time yet. A week or so.”

        When the Lizard King’s emissaries on earth stood up Yeltsin as drunken, slobbering stooge, Mother Russia was fortunate to have a Putin to stand in the breach and save her from being ruled by the same people who stood up Biden as a blathering, senile old man.I have ancestors who was with the regiments of men who ate their shoes wintering at Valley Forge. He was amongst real men who fought to the death for their people and to create this country for Our nation. Did they pledge their lives and their sacred honor for this disgusting humiliation this defiling and desecration of Our country and Our homeland?That someone has so much disdain for Our ancestors and for us to do this disgraceful thing to our once mighty nation is an unspeakable evil. We have been reduced to vassalage as an international shopping mall, an economic administrative zone and on-demand military to destabilize one’s regional rivals to enable territorial expansion is beyond an outrage. What a deep and egregious offense against all of us.That is just considering Biden as stooge. This doesn’t even begin with The Great Replacement and the dissolution of our borders and the invasion of our communities all across the heartland.The Regime has to go further mask off. The scale of the crimes they have and are committing are something we can’t really fully comprehend. What we do know they are massive and they demand that we find Ourselves and bring Justice and Order.This is absolutely insane.Let me get you even more angry. WPPI just published the numbers on what The Regime has done to Our people just since Biden was installed. (https://whitepapersinstitute.substack.com/p/joe-biden-drops-out-and-leaves-destruction)Things will heat up when names are named. Not the names of the stooges and actors; the names of those appointed to run things right before our very eyes.One goes about singing, “Rockin’ in The Free World”, in bar bands on failed diplomatic missions.

        My thought is that the Covid thing will be used as an excuse. I was at my doctor for a checkup last week and I had a cough and also had been around a person who said that he had Covid.Once I mentioned to my doctor that I was exposed to a person with Covid he left the room and returned with a mask on.I think the Covid mind virus still has a residue among shit libs and possibly Biden is a leper until the witch doctor releases him from the spell.

            Leave that doctor immediately.  How can you trust him to make important judgments about your health when he’s clearly ignorant of basic medical science, not to mention the fact that covid is little more than a circulating common cold?

        I remember it like it was yesterday. I’m driving up I-71 North from Cincinnati in late 1991. I hear the news bulletin that Gorbachev had suddenly fallen ill and and can no longer continue his presidency. Right now he is recuperating in his dacha. I knew right then what happened. Of course, he was removed.
Assuming Biden’s still alive, the Gorbachev parallel isn’t too bad of an analogy.

            You’re thinking August 1991 during the coup. Gorbachev was at his Black Sea dacha and incommunicado for 48 hours.
Gorbachev was in the Kremlin the night the USSR flag was replaced with the Russian Federation flag. He stopped being the head of state at midnight 25 December.

            Interesting thought. Perhaps as they used Stochastic Terrorism to get randos to attempt at Trump’s life with Mayorkas hobbling his SS detail, so they used it to get the feeble Biden to collapse in exhaustion and physical breakdown under unimaginable stress.Take a guy who should be comatose in an alzheimer’s care center and put him under a constant media campaign to step down knowing he is culpable of endless crimes. Guy must have totally melted down. They know that is likely to happen.To me, justice would be Biden alone in a care center where his precious, “New Americans” from Haiti, Nigeria etcetera abuse him. He and his mob bosses after all are responsible for this:https://www.amren.com/features/2024/07/the-many-murders-of-billy-chemirmir/

My first thought was this was over-the-top. But upon reflection, yeah, Biden deserves every bit of that. There’s nothing worse than a race traitor. Nothing.

        Ashes of the BeaconReturn to Table of ContentsAn Historical Monograph Written in 4930Of the many causes that conspired to bring about the lamentable failure of “self-government” in ancient America the most general and comprehensive was, of course, the impracticable nature of the system itself. In the light of modern culture, and instructed by history, we readily discern the folly of those crude ideas upon which the ancient Americans based what they knew as “republican institutions,” and maintained, as long as maintenance was possible, with something of a religious fervor, even when the results were visibly disastrous. To us of to-day it is clear that the word “self-government” involves a contradiction, for government means control by something other than the thing to be controlled. When the thing governed is the same as the thing governing there is no government, though for a time there may be, as in the case under consideration there was, a considerable degree of forbearance, giving a misleading appearancef of public order. This, however, soon must, as in fact it soon did, pass away with the delusion that gave it birth. The habit of obedience to written law, inculcated by generations of respect for actual government able to enforce its authority, will persist for a long time, with an ever lessening power upon the imagination of the people; but there comes a time when the tradition is forgotten and the delusion exhausted. When men perceive that nothing is restraining them but their consent to be restrained, then at last there is nothing to obstruct the free play of that selfishness which is the dominant characteristic and fundamental motive of human nature and human action respectively. Politics, which may have had something of the character of a contest of principles, becomes a struggle of interests, and its methods are frankly serviceable to personal and class advantage. Patriotism and respect for law pass like a tale that is told. Anarchy, no longer disguised as “government by consent,” reveals his hidden hand, and in the words of our greatest living poet,lets the curtain fall,And universal darkness buries all!Written by Ambrose Bierce in 1909. Amply worth reading it in its entirety.

        This is all well and good, but has anyone else noticed Vance’s wife? There’s something off about her, but I can’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe she spent too much time in the sun or something.Regardless, I think she should be the focus of attention, not insignificant things like foreign affairs or America’s fall from hegemony.
I thought Vance was a swell guy, but he really needs to get a better taste in women.

            Vance’s wife is his globalist controller. She has all the right credentials. You can see for yourself on her Wiki page.
It’s also odd that Vance’s kids look nothing like him. They don’t really look like his wife either. Perhaps the whole thing is a put up job.

        This is off topic but it’s something I’ve wanted to comment on and I keep forgetting.
I’ve long believed that the longer someones family has lived somewhere the greater the chance of them maintaining said place.
Yet two counterexamples I can think of are Gavin newsom and Ted wheeler. Newsom has roots in sf dating back to the 1860s and Ted wheeler (mayor of Portland) has ancestors who traveled the Oregon trail
What do you think explains them not making there own communities better?

            I see two explanations for white anti-whites.
1.  The hegemonic media has been dictating to white countries an anti-traditional white morality since at least WW2. Many whites sincerely believe this morality.2.  Whites are the most individualistic race, so many whites, who exist in an economy that incentives anti-traditional white values, will adopt anti-traditional white values to enrich themselves personally.

        The question arises, is this Biden dramady happening because the regime wants it to happen?Over at Powerline, Steven Haywardwonders:Was Biden set up? For more than a year, quite a lot of observers have confidently predicted that Biden would not be the nominee, and that the Democratic establishment would swap him out at an opportune moment…But the scheme needed a catalyst to work. That catalyst was obviously the June 27 debate. It was the earliest presidential debate ever, before either candidate was formally nominated… If that debate hadn’t happened until late September, as is typical, it would have been too late.

        I haven’t been able to shake off the perception that the GAE wants China to invade Taiwan more than China wants to invade Taiwan. But that aside, wouldn’t you think now would be the time to give that order? Just to use Taiwan as one example. It’s open season.So they have to wrap this up quickly. Joe has to die, and soon. So he will (as his brother foreshadowed). Any other scenario brings legitimacy questions, and as we have seen, maintaining the facade of legitimacy is paramount with the regime. Producing Joe Biden to speak coherently obviously isn’t an available choice, which leaves only one other option. There is a closing window for how long the “president” can be incapacitated yet still the president. And the 25th is not designed to be a fast process, nor is its outcome certain, if enacted (2/3 congressional majority required).

        What if maybe Biden wouldn’t agree to drop out of the race voluntarily, but they had already fired up the narrative he was going to by the weekend? So they told him he had Covid (again), and bundled him off to his usual vacation dacha. Thus kept incommunicado by the Secret Service, the conspirators were able to produce the necessary documentary evidence of his withdrawal. The only think missing is much physical evidence of Biden actually saying this. Republican Congressmen could create quite a ruckus by suggesting Biden might not be acting of his own accord (as per usual, but his aids have been pretending otherwise) and insist on a personal interview.

            [Throwing another log onto the conspiracy theory fire…]Secret Service Directress Kimberly Cheatle resigned today, presumably after the grilling she got before Congress. Sloppy security for Trump and all that. But what if there was a darker, more sinister reason? She’d have to be in the loop about Biden’s own protective detail, and if there is something that hasn’t been publicized yet, perhaps it was time to jump ship before hand. The analogy may not be perfect, but recall that the prison director resigned immediately after Jeffrey Epstein’s unfortunate suicide a couple years back.

                Cheatle’s professional deficiencies may have been a bit of a red herring. Like the Epstein thing, it was convenient to have a DEI pick to take the fall. Easy to ignore that apart from the inordinate amount of time Crooks took to line up his kill shot, and Trump’s sudden movement, the Butler, Pennsylvania op was very successful (that is, it should have worked). Nothing incompetent about it. Investigators ought to be looking for the competent ones who were in a position on the ground to have made it happen. Of course, count on the Republicans not to.

                Great diss. I loved that game back in my “golden age” of Layabout yet employed*: LSL was one of many games that helped pass the midnight shift away!*Later in my career I preferred the more precise term “Paid to remain in an air-conditioned room” when the curious asked what I did for work.

        Journowhores’ are writing celebratory over-the-top articles about Biden.The Washington PostHis selfless act of patriotism culminates a life of distinguished public service and assures his place in history as an exceptionally effective president.The GuardianBiden catches Covid-19. He retreats to his home in Delaware. He contemplates his mortality in the scale of his duty. He can read the polls. He comes to the epiphany that he could achieve his aims only by relinquishing his pride. He rose to the figure in Byron’s Ode:Where may the wearied eye reposeWhen gazing on the Great;Where neither guilty glory glows,Nor despicable state?Yes – one – the first – the last – the best –The Cincinnatus of the West,Whom envy dared not hate,Bequeath’d the name of Washington,To make man blush there was but one!Are you throwing up yet?

        I didn’t drop out! I’m now running for President of Ukraine. Hunters going to need a couple of billion to see him through the dark days when I am gone. Plus Jill needs to quit shopping the Pioneer Woman sales on dresses and switch to the Wellseley Lesbo Chic Ensombol. I am going to buy myself a Bugatti since every redneck in Alabama and Delaware have a ‘Vette. Time for a change up around here. What good is lying, cheating and stealing if you don’t live it up?

        why would they do this?
One possibility – hide the death until the most opportune moment to give a sympathy boost to the Democrat ticket (to the extent it would).

        This reminds me of how just recently the alt-right was “just asking questions” about Kate Middleton. By the end of the article, the conclusion is assumed. It’s almost like someone is trying to make this a thing, especially with how much astroturfing on forums and 4chan you’re seeing about it.
Then there’s how Z-man loves him some conspiracy theorizing except when it’s applied to him… an anonymous guy none of us know anything about really. Bad reader! Bad! Don’t be a crazy conspiracy nut! By the way has anyone seen Kate Middleton?????
