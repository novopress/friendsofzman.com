        “Without cyclical bouts of suffering, tyranny and violence then peace and security have no meaning”
I think peace is a value that stands on its own.  It doesn’t need a contrast to be experienced and appreciated.
“like cold and hot or light and dark. We may transcend this selfish and polarized realm of the ego someday.”
Hopefully sooner than later.

        Shuddh,
Agreed with your sentiment here in general. Yet there are limits. Peace is always fragile, transient– why is that? Peace-loving societies that cannot or will not defend themselves from inevitable enemies will disappear.
Without cyclical bouts of suffering, tyranny and violence then peace and security have no meaning, like cold and hot or light and dark. We may transcend this selfish and polarized realm of the ego someday. For now, practicing empathy is a good thing and I empathize with the French in this case.

        Hannon, ” Well, my tribe is more important to me than yours and my home is more important to me than my neighbor’s. That used to be “normal” but now it is labeled “hate”. ”Yes it is normal, average and ordinary.  However, above average persons are able to think beyond just “I, Me, Mine”.“Universal equality is an untenable and very destructive philosophy.”Lokah Samastah Sukinoh Bhavantu is an ancient Sanskrit saying that means, “May All Regions Be Granted Peace”.There is also another one, “May All Sentient Beings Know Peace”.Thinking in terms of one’s own family is slightly more advanced than thinking in terms of one’s own self.  But extending the same desires for peace and well-being that you wish for yourself and your family to other persons outside your family and beyond is higher still.The ancient sages were of the opinion that humans could practice empathy.Were they right or wrong?

        Deb Judge, “How exactly is 2000 people yelling “kill all the Jews” an example of empathy and compassion for others?”
I never suggested it was.
Om Shalom!

        The thing is, there is a right wing undercurrent in France.  FN made gains recently for a reason.  This will only continue for so long until they’ve finally had enough and they let the riot cops in with hats and bats.  I can tell you first hand, those guys do not fuck around.  That would be risky and probably a last resort of a kind but there are only so many demonstrations (read: riots) that they can absorb before things go pear shaped.

        This article nails it.  I am tired of mendacious stories about “French” rioters and “French” youth rioting in support of the Palestinians.  These “youth” are about as French as John Kerry.  The actual French, who are probably the most chauvinistic culture in Europe, are not going to tolerate this nonsense for long.  It must be tough to be a Frenchman these days, torn between the religion of liberalism, and the religion of “Frenchness”.  My guess is, Frenchness wins.

        Shuddh:Where do you get your news? Do you know the latest of unrest in Burma or Fiji or on the Colombia-Venezuela border? The media routinely drops news bombs that are devoid of meaningfulness, context or follow-up. Where is the humanity in that, and where do you suppose we derive our understanding and compassion for our fellow man these days?Instead of such service the media is promoting a truly demonic idea, namely that all these events, people and places are _interchangeable_, that no individual or tribe is more important than any other. Well, my tribe is more important to me than yours and my home is more important to me than my neighbor’s. That used to be “normal” but now it is labeled “hate”. Universal equality is an untenable and very destructive philosophy.

        Excellent post. The problem with the “bleeding heart” types, who always pose their words as if no one else is compassionate or caring, is that their hearts bleed for the wrong people: those who are at the bottom rungs of society. As if such people are somehow incapable of gross immorality and terrible deeds, and all the wrongs in the world are directed at them from people of higher status. This ubiquitous position is an irrational one. As the French Revolution demonstrates, the masses can impose a tyranny just as effectively as any elite class.

        “Its not “insane” to care about what happens to fellow humans outside of one’s own national boarders. There is such a thing as empathy and another thing called compassion.”
If that were really the case, the rioters would be protesting the rocket attacks Hamas launched on Israeli civilians to start the hostilities. The goal of Hamas and other Palestinian radicals continues to be the destruction of Israel, whatever the cost of misery and suffering to their own people.  7th Century barbarians, all of them.

        How exactly is 2000 people yelling “kill all the Jews” an example of empathy and compassion for others?
Zman calls lots of low IQ savages ‘low IQ savages’. Accuracy is not bias.
1.  Sloping foreheads?  check.2.  Drool. check3.  Prognathous jaw?  check4.  Inane chatter? check5.  Prominent brow ridges?  check6.  Murderous? check7.  Fling crap? Spittle flies when yelling? check8.  Poor taste in haberdashery? check and double check.
Let’s see.  Could be Ted Kennedy.  Nope.
Must be low IQ savages.  QED

        “In a sane world, the French people would not care all that much about what was happening between natives in a foreign land.”Its not “insane” to care about what happens to fellow humans outside of one’s own national boarders.  There is such a thing as empathy and another thing called compassion.“If it were one of her colonies, maybe it would make the news.”Surely you are not suggesting that news in each country should contain only events that take place within the boarders of each respective country, are you?Not having access to world events makes one ignorant of the world he or she lives in.
