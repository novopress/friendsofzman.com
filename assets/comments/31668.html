        Five important things happened this week that are related.1. Trump won 9-0 at SCOTUS.  And their ruling was really quite devastating AND SHORT.  We may see a rapid end of the J6 and Documents cases.  5-4?  Well, maybe presidents aren’t immune.  9-0 in a direct attempt to interfere in an election?  Red alert.2. Michelle Obama let it be known she is not running for POTUS, after #1 was announced.  The timing was not an accident which leads me to…3. Trump destroyed Nikki Haley 99-3 on Super Tuesday.  The Sea Island Billionaire strategy to defeat Trump is dead.  Big Mike is not stupid.  They see the bloodbath that is coming which includes…4. Sen Kirsten Sinema announced she will not seek reelection in AZ.  Voter fraud will not save her.  Democrats and their vile policies of the last 3 years have angered the public in ways that are getting out of hand, including specifically Ukraine…5. Victoria Nuland “retires”, which is usually the kind of thing you see happen when the incumbent party either loses, or is about to lose, an election.  They go into obscurity to manage the resistance fighters and plot their return to power.  Trump is running as explicitly anti-war in Ukraine.  Nuland, and her catastrophe there, is now a liability.  She also failed in the color revolution against Orban in Hungary.  They need her a million miles away and we’ll be treated to a solid 5 months of Biden claiming Ukraine was Trump’s idea, and it failed because of Trump Repubs in Congress.  This will not work because Trump has a very long record that also happens to be the one the public massively agrees with.  Anyway, they need Nuland to go into hiding because they need to start blame-shifting.This was a landmark week in Election Year 2024.  Democrats are increasingly fearful of what they are calling MAGA “anger” and “revenge”.  Jan 6th, once an insurrection, increasingly looks like a missed opportunity that MAGA isn’t going to miss a second time.

            Yes, this is why they are letting all these migrants into the country. They are not an army. They are agents of chaos that will be used to justify violating posse comitatus laws. Americans will be begging for a military presence on the streets. Then it will be turned against us.

        Shortly before the 2019 election in the UK, I read a random comment from a Twitter user under a post about the old Labour Party.  His father had been from a solidly working class background in the north of England, and was the first in his family to to go to university.  After passing the Eleven Plus exam, he went to a Grammar School and eventually got into Cambridge.Anyway, having a strong regional accent (and this being a time when class divides were more pronounced) he was understandably self-conscious.  He would tell his son that the posher the person, the nicer they were to him.  Can you guess what the middle-class social climbers were like? I can certainly imagine where they ended up.C.S. Lewis (from The Inner Ringhttps://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/):“The quest of the Inner Ring will break your hearts unless you break it. But if you break it, a surprising result will follow. If in your working hours you make the work your end, you will presently find yourself all unawares inside the only circle in your profession that really matters. You will be one of the sound craftsmen, and other sound craftsmen will know it. This group of craftsmen will by no means coincide with the Inner Ring or the Important People or the People in the Know. It will not shape that professional policy or work up that professional influence which fights for the profession as a whole against the public: nor will it lead to those periodic scandals and crises which the Inner Ring produces. But it will do those things which that profession exists to do and will in the long run be responsible for all the respect which that profession in fact enjoys and which the speeches and advertisements cannot maintain.”The craftsmen.  Everything gossips and zealots and harpies and climbers are not.  I want a breakaway civilization.  I want the Nulands fired into the sun.

        Managers who pay no penalty for making serious errors have no “skin in the game,” as the saying goes.
That practice should be ended, and some kind of verbal abasement for one’s error(s) isn’t really enough. Maybe the loss of a finger or ear might be sufficient.
In any case, I’m sure that some penalty scale can be devised.

        I doubt Nuland gravitates to MSNBC or CNN or any other national security state propaganda organ since that is uncomfortably visible. Less than three percent of Americans know who she is, and that likely is double the number before the cluster catastrophe in Ukraine. She is bailing before it implodes and her name comes up very much. Even marginal public presence is problematic.War criminals like to keep low profiles, so she’ll likely become a visiting professor at Big Ivy or work with her husband Bob at the in-flight magazine of the Regime, Foreign Affairs, where she can exult the Neocons to kill again and kill a lot somewhere else. This will continue until the money printer burns out and no one will face any consequences for their crimes against humanity barring canned sunshine or foolishly traveling to the wrong place abroad. I don’t see this broad’s fat ass on a flight to Belarus any time soon, and suspect the canned sunshine will light up all the wrong people if God forbid that happens.

            Trump would do well to give a foreign policy speech that unambiguously states that the people responsible for this catastrophe, and complicit in the deaths of 500,000 Ukrainian soldiers, will be investigated and if crimes are found, prosecuted.  Money laundering would be a great place to start.
Let’s find out where that money went, and to whom.

        Off topic – albeit tangentially related to yesterday’s post – I take breaks from dreary and depressing world trends doing various things, both useful and useless.  One of my time wasters is indulging in online card games (free cell and pyramid).  Since I won’t pay, I have to watch ads.  Since I try to avoid the most obnoxious of the DEI ads (Adobe) I often end up watching 15-30 second ads for online games, and a lot of online gambling.The two names that show up repeatedly are BagelCode and Murka Games.  I finally looked into both this morning.  Murka (crude play on rural pronunciation of America) was founded by Jews in Ukraine, and then bought by  – drumroll – Blackstone in 2019, and is now headed by Barak David.  Bagelcode was founded in Korea but also has offices in Tel Aviv.Oriental managerialism?  Ethnic nepotism?  Encouraging and profiting from people’s weaknesses?  Spreading vice?  Seems to tick all the boxes.

        I don’t think Nuland is being “allowed” to resign due to failure. The ruling class is never punished for failure. They just simply move into other positions where they can continue the grift. When they lose elections, they get appointed to bureaucratic positions or get hired as lobbyists making quadruple the money.You see this a lot in the education business. There is a whole class of college and public school administrators that move from one high-paying position to another like a game of musical chairs no matter what their actual record of accomplishment or failure actually is.Look at Claudine Gay — sure, the Jews kneecapped her as president of Harvard, but despite being a plagiarist and academically weak she got to keep her tenured position as a professor and her $1 million salary. How exactly is that “failure” for a colored woman from Haiti???I worked at a college once where under the “first woman president” enrollment dropped by 30%. The faculty held a confidence vote and 89% — yes, EIGHTY-NINE per cent — voted “no confidence.”She left… and got hired by a college three times bigger and got paid double the money.

            Kinda like NFL head coaches – they just move around from one team to the next when they get canned – maybe not as the top dog, but some other well paying gig nonetheless.  Total incestuous joke.

                Kliff Kingsbury is the classic example of a football coach who consistently fails upward. And he’s not even a nuggra, although his sexual orientation is open to grave question.

            Add ton that the revolving door of corporate CEO’s and board members who crash and burn banks and companies to the ground, get a nice parachute severance package, always in the millions of dollars with stock options, only to re-emerge with another company, wash rinse repeat.I cannot fathom how western civilization which was built on merit and competence, evolved into a system of “failure is to be rewarded.”These people cause stockholders to lose money, employees to lose jobs, and in many cases tax payers to cover the asses of these incompetents in the form of govt bailouts, and yet… Are rewarded.This seems to also be thing with losing but “big name” NFL and NHL coaches.Don’t make the playoffs or worse, move on to another franchise with a pay raise.No system of any kind can sustain itself by rewarding failure.

            Right on the button.  It’s a female nation vs a masculine nation.  The West is feminist and the East ain’t.
The hard men of Russia and China don’t care about one-upping, gotchas, and junior high school exclusion tactics.  Such tactics derive from a feminine mind and society.

            Yep. Zman wrote that they tried to isolate Putin. What in fact happened is that our “elite” found THEMSELVES isolated. They really don’t get the new reality that the RoW – Rest of the World – doesn’t give a damn what they think. And they still haven’t grasped the fact.

        I think the reading of the nuland thing wrong. Ick Vic is being promoted for a job very well done. She is moving from the “working ” class of elites to the “managerial ” class of elites. she no longer has to be in the public eye and working on “projects” . the plant manager at GM  has a hard job of running operations . when he is promoted to E suite , life gets easier for him. state dept is a “plant ” , one of many for her superiors. Nuland is moving to the E suite.Her list of accomplishments is long. consider that once this is finally over , much of the worlds best farmland will move into “western investors” hands  .https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/new-report-take-over-ukrainian-agricultural-landwhen the EU/WEF finishes destroying private agriculture in Europe, and the US government polishes it off here, that land and the 30% of the worlds wheat it produces annually will be  almost priceless.  the rest of the rebuilt  Ukrainian economy will be owned by blackrock .https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/zelenskyy-blackrock-ceo-fink-agree-to-coordinate-ukraine-investment.html.This great bonanza for them was made possible by the death of 600K ukrainian and 120K Russian Christians, the wounding of a 1.5 million more. somewhere near 250 K Ukrainian women and children are missing.   ad up to 10 million Ukrainians have fled the country. including many of the former owners of the now barren farmland in eastern Ukraine .there is no way that setting up a windfall like that for your backers/owners is considered a loss . ,but it will be portrayed as a loss by those who famously said ” The best time to buy is when there is blood in the street.”  What they don’t say is that they are setting up the bloodletting themselves.now they are on russia’s doorstep too. very helpful for any future operation or subversions .and normie is none the wiser.

                Actually, they can be shamed. They view life as a book and the entry of “shame” into their life bothers them tremendously. jews are self-delusional and non-self-aware. But you can indeed “shame” them by using the word three times, say what you will. “SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON YOU! S-H-A-M-E ON YOU AND YOURS!!!”I guarantee this works with most jews even at the highest levels. They will take great offense, and possibly seek retribution, but they will internalize the mantra you should learn. Try it out for any reason and especially for no reason like a petty offense.It works.

            You’re assuming the West will win in the Ukraine, nothing you say is valid if Russia wins. Do you think Russia will let Blackrock and the rest keep the farmland and be involved in reconstruction? Russia, I think, will make sure the land is brought back and the people taken care of well. Look at what they’ve done in the parts they have already annexed.

Putin will get his part. and he will benefit enormously from heigher grain prices . russia is a big grain exporter. so putin will definately win. do not believe the western proppaganda media , the russ are killing ukes at a 10 to 1 ratio. sad as that is , it means russia is not sufferint anywhere near as much as ukraine.

            Disagree on that one. Her one job was to destroy Russia. Not only did she fail, but Russia is stronger now than it has been since 1991. It has the world’s most combat-experienced army and has forged extremely close relations with the neocons’ other great enemies, Iran and China. If that’s not failure, I don’t know what is. And if you still don’t agree, look at this evil witch’s face: does that look like someone who is happy at her own boundless success?

        The idea of elites saving face is what turned me off from AB InBev products forever.  The horse-faced Jewess that ran Budweiser marketing decided it would be good for business to insult her customers and cater to perverts who don’t drink beer.  But instead of being fired for costing her company billions of dollars, she was suspended, no doubt until the flyover rubes forgot the whole thing.   Had they simply apologized and fired her immediately, I probably would be back to drinking their watered down piss by now.  Calling me a fratty homophobe was bad enough, but doubling down and calling me stupid was the final straw.

                    &gt; Better yet, imported German beers. If you’ve never had a Bitburger, Franziskaner, Paulaner or Warsteiner you’ve never had a real beer.
Those are all “gateways” to the real German beers. Weihenstephaner, Veltins, and others make Warsteiner and Bitburger look like Budweiser and Coors by comparison.

        This isn’t oriental managerialism.  No need for pretty new concepts.This is just what a nation looks like when its women take over.  And are enabled and funded in their empowerment by weak men and selfish daddies.‘The so-called “Karen culture” is a natural product of an elite harvested from the middle-class.’The Raging Karens that run New Amerika are a product of centuries of mass, intense brainwashing for feminism and gynocentric culture.  They’re drawn largely from both the middle and elite classes.   Queen Victoria Nuland makes an excellent example of why placing females in charge of everything — and simultaneously stomping on men for decades — leads only to disaster and death.And p.s. no consequences for Vicki, because consequences are only for males, chump.The U.S. is thoroughly gynocentric, as is illustrated by the dominance of celebrity-culture, Safety Everything, and the Woke Arts over these many foul decades.You can’t change or reform a theory (e.g., oriental managerialism) because there’s nothing to grab onto, it’s just words in the air.  You can, however, change people, or at least inhibit them from inverting and ruining everything.  It works, when the worst among you aren’t endlessly ‘liberated’.  History illustrates.You can reform and restore your nation by returning it to masculine guidance and control as in long-ago years, when the nation functioned incredibly well.  Or you can continue to descend into the poison pink haze.

                A masculine, largely Christian, revival is still possible in the U.S.  Because God will back that one up.White men forming a Tribe?  I can’t see that happening in America.  White men are not tribal and you need a remedy, now.There is no spiritual impetus for ‘white men’ tribing up, but there is a huge amount of such impetus already extant (and quickly building) in the U.S. and elsewhere in the West.  Do not imagine the powers have not noticed.Such an authentic spiritual transformation is always led by men, never women.  Women are made from this Earth and are creatures of it.Your enemies don’t fear whites per se, they fear strong men with traditional, a-modern values.  Churchianity doesn’t offer that, but real Christianity does.

        Perhaps the saving face culture is just a result of the formation of managerial systems? After all, China was one of the first nations to establish a bureaucracy based on exams and meeting established standards rather than personal connections and privilege. Western societies begin creating similar bureaucracies and suddenly we see the same type of behavior.

        It’s hard to see how or why Nuland’s “retirement” has anything to do with failure, since the GAE braintrust has admitted no failure, neither publicly nor probably to itself either, and its efforts in Ukraine are purely, nobly motivated, on the side of the angels, resisting the great evil of the orange man loving Putler and his unprovoked invasion. The narrative has not changed. This has always been, still is, portrayed as the great geopolitical struggle of our time for which our loins must be girded, so why, pray tell, would she need to be punished for it, and what is she saving face from? Indeed, the only things (publicly) wrong with the GAE’s effort in Ukraine is that not enough money is being spent, not enough wunderwaffen deployed. Perhaps someday we will know why she “retired,” but I don’t think we know right now. I’m pretty sure she is not being punished for excessive zeal in waging war against Putler.As to the larger point: To be an intellectual in the west today means you have to believe the same things as all the other intellectuals. Which means that there is no intellectual class in the west today, unless it’s among dissidents and unrecognized as such. For that’s what happens the moment you diverge from the groupthink, you become a dissident, at least in the eyes of the blob. For the managerial class, which today is more or less the same thing as the “intellectual” class, and certainly governed by the same “rules,” the ONLY failure is failure to conform. There is nothing else for which one can be punished.

        This is another deep dive on social organization, hats off to the Z.As Citizen notes, the institutions are now dedicated to preventing any White competitor elite from forming.  There must not be any Rebel generals like George Washington allowed to live.Dissident groups are trying to rally- note figures like Padraig Martin (Dixie Identity) and Ken Paxton (Lone Star Republic).Do we have enough time to form a Grange, a coalition of the productive fringes?Wherein will arise a new and natural aristocracy, or do we have to wait for the Federal Reserve to fail first?  How else to cut the cords on the golden parachutes?Perhaps if we had an alternative media that highlighted not the evils, but the unnoticed successes, in aggregate.  Presenting a coalescing picture of destiny.Also, on the shadedly positive side, as long as the printer-go-brrr can stave off its collapse, buys us time for the forge to hammer out tenacious rebels.  The Trump train, for all its faults, can’t be ignored or dismissed.Of course, this buys time for the Agenda 2030 crowd, but hey, it is war, after all.Canada, beaten down Canada, led the way with the Trucker Revolt, and now all of Europe’s farmers are raising their fists.

            This week I’ve been reading a book on the growth of party and machine in the United States, authored during the Wilson administration.  The history of Tammany is one that could serve as fertile ground for dissidents; lessons both positive and negative abound.  It sprung up immediately after the Revolutionary War to fill the vacuum that had been previously filled by now-obsolete groups like the Sons Of Liberty.  Noted political schemer Aaron Burr was heavily involved in its initial development.Now, the amount of graft its sachems indulged in is staggering, even by today’s dollar figures they were spectacularly corrupt – it was believed that Boss Tweed, in the 1870s, managed to siphon off approximately $50 million for himself.  And yet, they would ride out brief spasms of reform and return to power every time.  Their organization was that good, and that practiced, that no one could compete with them long-term.When this book was written, Tammany had taken over New York City yet again (125 years into its existence!), but it made me think that we don’t associate Tammany with the 20th century.  Although the author didn’t know it, this was sort of a last hurrah.What changed immediately afterward?  I suspect the 19th amendment coupled with the shutting off of the immigrant spigot.  The organization was notorious for combing the Ellis Island crowd on election day and getting Tammany associated judges to perform mass naturalization ceremonies.  The immigrants would get a piece of paper filled out that only required a rubber stamp.  Sometimes Tammany would arrange for fraudulent paperwork, which would get tenement dwellers into the voting booth but confer on the bearer no actual rights and privileges.  Once this steady stream of new voters disappeared, they lost a huge electoral advantage.And of course with women’s suffrage came the notion that politics had to clean up its act.  Deals cut in smoke-filled backrooms were tawdry and déclassé.  And where were the uber-wealthy political fixers and patrons of the fair sex?  Tammany was successful when it could rely on time-tested methods of cutting deals.  Once the rules of the game changed, it withered away.Organization and a masculine posture served the machine well.  Forming Grange-like front organizations is never a bad idea.  Small communities are useful, but without communication, ties, and hierarchy, they’ll always be susceptible.  True power comes from will and numbers.

                    The Boss And The Machineby Samuel Orth, part of “The Chronicles of America Series”, from 1919.  It’s a dusty hard cover I picked up from my local library years ago as they were clearing out older stock.  The last time it had been checked out was 1968!

            Right. But don’t forget, “Local, local, local.” Or any of the other formulations you see over at WRSA. It should be possible to build a confederation of local units, allies and trading partners you can trust, but anyone who thinks he can form a top-down White Christian Nation anytime in the next few generations is fooling himself.

        You can see this in the ebb and flow of empires.  In modern times Stalin was the builder and master operator of the Soviet machine.  The machine existed for him and to serve him.  Once he was gone the machine was left operating by its various parts.   FDR created the American version of this machine.  It was much more nuanced and complex as it involved the public believing that they were still free (we haven’t been) and could get a fair shake.  Once FDR left the scene it became an apparatus of its moving parts.  One of these machines broke down in 1991 and the other is breaking down today.  Both contained lathed parts from their creation, and new retrofitted parts for subsequent goals.  But each generation of functionaries knew the inner workings of the machine less and less.  In today’s late empire America, no one in the system even knows what half the parts are for.  Many of the newest parts are entirely foreign to the country.Empires are always the creation of flesh and blood people.  They could be as evil as the day is long, but they exist to serve them.  Once they pass, the place is run by empty suits because the empire itself is an empty suit.

        Part of the reason Nuland was allowed to “fail up” was because the dead and mangled bodies weren’t of her own tribe. If she had caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of her own people, there would have been serious consequences.

        The idea that a devastating punishment for Putin and Russia was to ban them from the cool kids table is an important one. However, the cool kids are increasingly seen as the crazy kids and leaders from other countries are increasingly picking up their trays and moving to other tables. Your see this with BRIC+ and a variety of other acronym groups such as SCO.Because the Western Jewish and white cool kids live in a bubble they have no idea how their cherished beliefs are seen as repugnant by most of the world. Do what we say or we will confiscate your cash reserves. Honor anal sex and marriage or you won’t get that loan. Time for you to destriy your farming sector to help Mother Gaia.Those cherished beliefs play well at a Manhattan or Georgetown cocktail party but leave normal people, including many of the elites of Russia and non white nations, with a desire to diversify their risk. My favorite example is still Blinken bragging about how everytime he meets with the Saudi Royal Family he discusses anal sex. I can imagine the discussions when he leaves the room.Rasmussen reported that his survey on the elite found them committed to banning private air conditioning (not for themselves but for you no doubt). This and all the aspects of the Great Reset are going to make the cool kids table a lot more lonely.

                    In the 80’s it became a popular trope in TV shows and movies to depict the alpha crowd as both vicious and ineffectual.  It was going to be Revenge of the Nerds from there on out.  Show after show, movie after movie since then has depicted the neurotic, impulsive, slightly intelligent types as always being on the top of the food chain.What group embodies those traits, again?  The same group that was writing and producing that schlock.Sometimes real life doesn’t work quite like the Early Life crowd would have us believe.  Sometimes the cool kid table comes out on top.

Exactly.  It is quintessentially female social behavior.  Girls exclude from the Cool Kids Table, not boys.  Girls and women use group-exclusion and shaming to achieve their ends.  Not men.
You can’t just toss your men outta education and employment for forty years, plug your daughters in, and expect everything to go just spiffily.  Yes yes I know she’s your Precious Perfect Punkin’, but she is destroying Western Civilization.
Nothing to do with orientalism, everything to do with feminism.

            The cool kids these days are all to the East of Europe. They are building a whole new world, for better or worse. We in the West have no idea. Despite all our talk about diversity and respecting other cultures, we still think that the whole world follows our lead. Nothing could be further from the truth. I was listening to a program yesterday about the new Arctic sea trade route between China and Russia. While we are squabbling about pronouns, the BRICS+ are going into overdrive. The West is a doomed, and I never thought I’d ever live to say “Good!”

        The lack of an accountability feedback mechanism in any society is a serious pathology. Without it, error is reinforced rather than corrected, and it always leads to an eventual larger failure and ultimately collapse. In the context of governments, we delude ourselves with the belief that voting is a remedy to the problem of failed politicians. Yet incumbency is &gt;97% and most of these actors are genuinely stupid, evil, and/or corrupt. And its getting worse faster.The best indicator of this decline is the growth of sovereign debt all across the West. We’ve been eating the seed corn for decades now and those chickens will soon come home to roost. But we’ve institutionalized the political pathology of print/spend fiat money to buy votes, get reelected, and then rinse and repeat. That bubble will burst, real hardship will return, and then it gets interesting. Best to be at least somewhat fit when that happens.

        Re: “ The so-called “Karen culture” is a natural product of an elite harvested from the middle-class.”
I don’t know. It seems to me that 90% of Karens are just white, middle-class women who are angry that nothing is working as it is supposed to. Poor dears don’t realize things are never going to work properly again.
I doubt the canary in the coal mine is especially charming either.

            They bought all the 60s feminism crap from Steinem et al and now they are alone, angry and bitter. Meanwhile, the new generation of women are even angrier and stupider. Men are either gay or disgusted by them. They’ll have an even worse future than their predecessors. I see many cats in their futures.

        In the old-fashioned business books written prior to 1990s, failure was often presented as bad. People mortgaged their own house to fund the company. So, failing meant losing house. If the business was funded by a bank loan, failure also meant bank never giving loan to the person for another business.Modern Silicon Valley business culture sees failure as experience and wisdom.  San Bankman-Fried will likely be treated as hero if he tries to raise money for another cryptocurrency startup. The WeWork guy definitely is, because the VCs are now paying him for another similar startup for apartment rental.Victoria Noodleman is definitely coming back for another world-improvement project. Maybe this time, some country in Asia will need her gentle care. BTW, did you notice that the John Bass guy got promoted for the disaster he made with the leave-Afghanistan project?

            In the old-fashioned business books written prior to 1990s, failure was often presented as bad.Agreed. I’ve pointed out before that the General Manager in charge of the late, unlamented Edsel division of Ford Motor Company, Richard E. Krafve, was shown the door when the division was closed. Losing $250 Million of 1960 money ($2.5 Billion in BidenBucks) can do that for a fellow.That said, he did surface later in the 1960s at Raytheon so a bit of what Z says was going on with Managerialism way back when.Failure is inevitable at some point, but there’s a difference between Ford, which launched a product they thought the public wanted (“All our marketing said it would be a hit!”) and say, A/B, who openly insulted Bud Light drinkers with a troon and a “Karen” VP of marketing caught on video stating the brand identity was “fratty and out-of-touch humor”. Heck, I don’t even know if Alissa got the old heave-ho.

                The thing is, Edsel didn’t fail because it was poorly run.  The Edsel was a pretty good car and the division wasn’t especially run into the ground by management.  The Edsel just didn’t sell well.
Your point about A/B is a good one.  Now that is a dept that needs cleaning out starting with the head woman and everyone who works with her.

                    Edsel didn’t fail because it was poorly run. The Edsel was a pretty good car and the division wasn’t especially run into the ground by management.Not to make this Car Chat, but “Edsel was a pretty good car”, not really. Quality wise the models, at least for 1958, had some measure of poor quality. Ford based the lower two models on Ford platforms, and the upper two models on Mercury platforms. Then ran them down the same lines as Ford or Mercury cars. To quote La Wiki:The 1958 Edsels were assembled in both Mercury and Ford factories. The longer-wheelbase models, Citation and Corsair, were produced alongside the Mercury products, while the shorter-wheelbase models, Pacer and Ranger, were produced alongside Ford products. Workers assembling Fords and Mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional Edsel that moved down the line burdensome, because it required them to change tools and parts bins, then switch back to resume assembling Fords or Mercurys after completing assembly on Edsels. The workers were also expected to accommodate Edsel assembly with no adjustment in their hourly quota of Ford and Mercury production. Consequently, the desired quality control of the different Edsel models proved difficult to achieve, even when the Fords and Mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines. Many Edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished. Uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics, some of whom never installed the additional parts at all. Some dealers did not even receive all the parts.In the March 1958 issue of Popular Mechanics, 16% of Edsel owners reported poor workmanship, with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure. In its test car, Popular Mechanics tested for these problems and discovered others, notably a badly leaking trunk during rain, and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled.As for management, I’ll save you the boring details on pricing structures, but for the first year the car was on the market, there was real confusion over just where the car fit at Ford. For a few bucks less you could get a nicely trimmed out Ford, or for a few bucks more you could get a nicely trimmed out Mercury, brands people knew. And launching in the middle of a recession didn’t help either.So yes, some of the mess IS on Ford.A/B, that’s all on them. 😏

                        The above is the kind of stuff that makes this comment section.  Thanks.  When I was young, the neighbors had an Edsel.  What I remember was that it was “strange”—especially the push button transmission.  Still hate it, but it’s now part of the wife’s new Lincoln.  The more things change….

                        But how much of this was planned and how much was it a workaround for the poor sales?Had the Edsel taken off, it would have had its own production line.I like the push-button transmission.  The Fury had it too and that was Mopar.  The mechanism was a bit complicated though on the Edsel.To be fair, I see the Edsel with modern eyes on a vintage car.  I wasn’t even alive at the time, let alone buying a new or slightly used car as an adult in the 50s. So it is somewhat difficult to see it as people saw it then.Chrysler released a car in the 30s that was a bit ahead of its time, the Air Flow. The styling which was informed by aerodynamics was just not right for the era.  I think largely the same thing happened with the Edsel.  There are definitely worse examples in Detroit history.  The X body Citation by Chevrolet, for example.  Or the Pinto by Ford.  This is still going on today, like the dual clutch Ford transmission (everyone involved in this should be fired and banned from the industry).

Chinese, Indian, American, European, Japanese, Latin American, African, and Arab founders rarely get another chance at VC funding after a failure, if they even managed to get funding in the first place.

                Failure is experience and wisdom— if you pay the price for it. These guys don’t seem to, so they don’t learn the lesson.
Plus, isn’t the idea basically a pump and dump? Get the hype for your startup and sell at a profit before the shine’s off the turd?

                    Failing with someone else’s money doesn’t impart the same lessons as failing with your own, and leads to this zeitgeist of failure being framed as a positive. Nobody who failed with their own money talks about how great it was, unless they subsequently went on to success, and usually much later.

            I think there is an interpretation layer about failure that needs to be understood. In the fiat regime, novelty creates opportunity for the unproductive and more buzzwords for midwits. The SV ethos around failure in the healthy part is not a celebration of failure. It is a process of building something in order to learn if it is technically feasible and/or a market for it exists. It is done to gather information and to avoid destroying capital by drawing out and extending failed experiments longer than needed to know that they failed.Now, the midwits take this and turn it into a cliche and they do indeed celebrate failure and show up at tech crunch and wired and other trade show desks and prattle on about failure.I do like your post and it is sad that so many “thought-leaders”, are really lemmings. Thus, the need to call oneself a, “thought leader.” Vanity.As for the promotions after the catastrophic failures that you mentioned it is curious. You wonder, if the failure was the point. That is, some aspect of the project succeeded and so that part is rewarded. I suspect that what is at play is the deep and intense corruption of the system. The point is probably to grift off of the money printing machine and carry out egregiously psychopathic imperial projects that are evil. So, you have a bunch of people who know how corrupt the system is. What do you do with them to keep them from coming clean and disrupting the grift? You reward them with promotions as a way to buy their silence.That is my guess. I am sure that there are cases where it is a case of make-pretend. The project failed and the participants are losers, but if you give promotions and enhance titles than everyone assumes and pretends that these are rewards for a job well done.The system is rotten. Okay everyone! You know what time it is? It’s trophy time! Okay. Line up. Now, you all know the sexuality-race matrix rules. Line up according to the rules. Chet! Brant! What color are your eyes and hair? That’s right blue and blonde. Now go to the back of the line and get your trophy last to undo your privilege points – for today only.Oh! Everyone. I have a special announcement to make to all of our communities. Next year we will not keep score. Everyone will always be a winner!

                Yes, that’s what “we” need. It’s just not what “they” need, which, in this case, are the people writing the IRS regs.Used to be saving for retirement (like in my dad’s day) was trivial. Buy a stock, they write you a check quarterly for dividends, you invest that elsewhere, or skip the check and just have it reinvested (usually at a discount, or even free) if you want a larger position. That’s it. Problem is that does not generate churn, so does not generate tax. Capital gains, where you can impute “asset value” to things like “customer sentiment” and other imaginary crap, generates all kinds of churn for the brokers and taxable events for the government. Even if you never see a penny of it.

        Elon musk showed the only way to deal with this problem with his Twitter purchase: fire 70% immediately and clean up with another 10% in the second culling.
This doesn’t seem remotely possible under our current managerial system of sinecures and military/industrial/think tank/congressional complex.
Still, what can’t go on, won’t.  $35 trillion in the hole and an additional $1 trillion spent ever 100 days doesn’t bode well.

        Victoria Nu-land.  Family name in Galicia Ukraine, Nudelman.Chrystia Free-land.  Family name in Galicia Ukraine, Komyak.A short article noted their names are code names.Like the Sikh are trying to do with Kashmir, or as the Rothschilds did with Palestina Israel, this sub-tribe’s vision is to recapture a historic homeland, Khazaria,* lost to them since 965 and 1027 AD by the Rus princes.(That, in itself, is a retelling of the Jerusalem narrative, taken in 70 and 135 AD.Just as the American narrative is a continuation of the War ofThree Kingdoms.)I read the Bible as this narrative process peated and repeated, just as actual tribes break off, meet again, sometimes fight, and recombine.I want the Dissidents to create a Narrative that can guide us, that we can follow to our own destiny.  Christian Nationalism, Southern Resurgance, and Wotan’s Return are all credible efforts._______________*(All credit to B125 for noticing “lost Khazaria” in the first place. His observation is beyond viral, it’s now commonly accepted, another brick in the wall.)

                Small factual correction re :  “Like the Sikh are trying to do with Kashmir”.
The area the Sikhs are trying to recapture is the Indian part of Punjab, not Kashmir.
Allegations have been made that the Indian government has knocked off a leader or two of the separatist movement, much to the annoyance of the alleged son of Castro who heads the Canadian government.

        I attend company board meetings. My wife attends Fortune 50 and Big Banks board meetings, some virtual which makes me a fly on the wall sometimes. Almost to a board member and c-level, these are toadies who have mastered the great game of sucking up. Somewhat above average g IQ, not all, they are almost exclusively driven by their imperative to maximize personal compensation. I have become a small hat hater, due to exposure, but majority of the board members are white folks and nominal Christians. One hundred years ago majority of our elites were actually elite in comparison with the labor force. Today, in terms of socially-beneficial elitism if you will, the class of managers and labor are all one single gooey gob of low-class sickos and perverts disengaged with raising healthy families and catering to their own hedonistic practices. I predict doom. Maybe I just haven’t consumed enough coffee this morning.

            My experience has been that many VP/C-level execs have high verbal IQs, and can get their peers nodding their heads without actually taking a hard position on anything.  But when they are put in charge of actual operations, they fail miserably.

        &gt; The accused was allowed to depart and save face, without suffering more than a minor loss of social standing.It’s very common in corporations to give higher-ups an out when they screw up, either by telling them ahead of time they are getting axed so they can resign, or giving them a phony-baloney do-nothing job that gives them enough time to find another opportunity with another company.One time an upper management type got smashed at a holiday party and did or said something that simply couldn’t get pushed under the rug.

No one wants to deal with a cornered animal who feels he’s losing everything. The problem is a little face saving to soften the fall to a lower position more suited to their skills is very different than our modern parasites who either fail upwards or swing from org to org spreading destruction wherever they go.

            Sometimes they rally. My sponsor at the second BigLaw firm I practiced with, the guy who also served as the chief pilot of the firm’s first jet on the side, was caught out in the firm’s drinking culture when a half dozen partners walked in on him and a paralegal while they were having sexual relations on top of a copying machine, both were married with family at the time. He was immediately demoted to “of counsel” for a few years but then ascended back up the ranks to firmwide executive committee. They just never let him fly the plane again, which makes little sense because he clearly has great coordination. Yet another war story.

                Isn’t it generally understood that, for various reasons, pilots tend to do quite well with the ladies?
Also, I bet the paralegal was hot, which would weigh in the pilot’s favor as well as a clandestine high-five or two after the dust had settled.

            “One time an upper management type got smashed at a holiday party and did or said something that simply couldn’t get pushed under the rug. The next day an email expressed how he found “an exciting new opportunity” and was leaving.”What I can’t get my head around is how these people find future employment—often at positions equal to or higher than they left.  My experience is in academia and at the university level.  I remember my last university president.  She had several other presidencies, all being of short duration 3-5 years.  This is indicative of simple failure and repeated poor performance at the helm. Nonetheless she jumps immediately to a top 20 research university and gets to fail there yet again.  I retired and lost tract of where she failed next, but you get the picture.In this State, the university president is a position that involves the highest scrutiny—at the school level, the Board of Regents level, and at the Governor’s level, hell the entire State.  And yet…. Perhaps it was a DIE issue, she was a first, as when we also hired a Hispanic (another first and a failure).

                    Every damned one of the last several City school superintendents hired in my nearby BRC has been vetted, naturally, after a nationwide “talent search”. They are always geniuses, with the salaries to prove it, yet end up after 3 years or so getting run out of town on a rail. Our local city has about 200,000 inhabitants (330,000 back when it was not a BRC). Two noteworthy failures at their task went on, respectively, to run the schools in Boston and in DC. Hardly demotions.
So yeah, the Agee effect, as miforest put it. There’s no other explanation.

            Total accident, to be honest. Spell check often gets confused with bourgeois, bourgeoise and bourgeoisie for some reason, so I had to think about which to use and noted the male/female gender and thought it was clever to use the feminine to make a subtle point. Usually I stick with the masculine, but every once in a while I remember to use the feminine to add some emphasis.

        holodomor famine is j-ish fault, no one blames the js, they blame the russians.
Ukraine war is a j-ish project, no one blames the js, they blame the ukrainian nazis.
Zelenski &amp; Nuland get to break dance to Hava Nagila till they reach 100, like kissinger, whilst ukrainians get their numbers culled every 100 years.
In a hundred years Ukraine will suffer the same fate. Why?
Cause they never learn their lesson, no one does.

        Exclusion has been the go-to tool for the ruling class for some time because for them, it’s what they fear most. They also attack any attempt by others to form their own groups, again because that would reduce the power of their exclusion.As Z notes, it’s a sign of who are the elite and their culture. The managerial class is very feminine and exclusion is definitely what women fear the most. But the ruling class is Jewish, who also fear exclusion as they can’t survive on their own.Confident men don’t fear exclusion. They form new groups and build a rival tribe. It’s why the ruling class will do anything to stop that from happening. And while the ruling class has been wildly successful at this within America, they’re failing to stop Russia, China, India and Iran from starting to build something outside of the West.Hopefully, the success of countries outside of the US will help our cause within the US.

        In a very short time the ACM went from a top CS/SE association where the top focus was achievement and knowledge accumulation and dissemination to having DIE departments. Here is a featured person this week: acm.org/articles/people-of-acm/2024/diedre-mulliganLook at the resume. Her research focuses on, “protecting values including privacy, equity and freedom of expression.” Uh. None of those are values. They are states – desired states or outcomes that managers want. Why do they want them? Well, it is a veil of sad-sack virtues that justify sinecures that grant an idle life of enjoying affluence and status.Managerialism seems to be only getting ever more entrenched like a hookworm deep in the intestines of society. The printing press continues to hum and whir.

            Former IEEE and ACM active member here. The rot in these and similar organizations set in well more than a decade ago. Most members are passivists, a social justice warrior will steamroll them every time.

                You hit on a very good point about the members of these sorts of institutions – their passive natures. It is no wonder they’ll be steamrollered.It is a great shame about the ACM, but totally predictable of course. Fellows don’t even know they’re in a battle.The oddest thing though, is that research into these fields, as well as correspondence and organization could still easily happen if the key members allwantedit to. If you want to speak to others about some new theories in compiler construction, just reach out and find them. Cut out the leftists and their organization.Of course, these members first need to realize that there is a problem.

                    It’s a bit more subtle than that. To most, they are not under attack. Currently, because of the company I’m  running (selling), I’m most familiar with NACE. The real one, Corrosion Engineers.
There are plenty of high quality papers there, and plenty of at least moderately decent research. All you have to do is skip over the occasional crap. Like you have to do with junk mail and spam anyway. Until it reaches some critical mass, it’s just business as usual.

        I don’t see the face saving. It sounds like she lost an in-fight to become Deputy Secretary of State. So she resigns and gets to keep her benefits. Or maybe she got fired and gets to keep her benefits. Same thing. And she’s got the connections to go somewhere else. No she suffers no real loss.The larger point is that a true elite doesn’t need to save face. The aristocratic class sets the norm and rules accordingly. The rest know their place. In this halcyon state of biological/cultural homogeneity based on common ancestry (both of which are likely myths,) there’s no civil strife as everyone knows their place and is content.Maybe managerialism will revert to our picture of medievalism, or maybe the next stage is Orwellian dictatorship via the current fascist merger of corp and state.

        “It never occurred to them that he and his government did not understand what any of this meant.”They probably did know and recognised it as one more attempt to ostracise Russia. But these days it’s not longer cool to be part of a losing coalition and the Western bloc is on its way down. Russia+China and the satellites around them is where the action is. It’s turning out that the USA and its thralls are succeeding in getting themselves ostracised.“Instead, they view themselves as having scored the better on the test, relative to others.”For sure the system is not aristocratic, with its noblesse oblige, but neither is it merit-based, like the exam system for selecting bureaucrats in old China. Difficult to classify this system we have — exactly how did these bums get to constitute themselves as a ruling class? Much of it is down to clannishness and nepotism, particularly among Jews. This clannishness is probably a big factor behind why Nuland is being allowed to quit without opprobrium.

            Being Jewish is definitely among the secret (in a sense) qualifications for membership in the “meritocratic elite.” Unz has the chart. But it’s not enough. I don’t think a list could be made. I think everyone is tested individually, according to the preference(s) of the tester(s).In my case, I’d probably be some kind of intelligence director now if not for rejecting a single sexual advance when I was 16. No “opportunities for advancement” *of any kind* ever followed. Can’t blame boomer greed, The Economy, reversion to the mean, etc., for my being poorer than my parents. I failed a test I didn’t recognize, and word got out. What word? To whom? Not sure. But everything changed.To “fail upward” as far as Nuland has, to a height from which she can personally order the deaths of millions, she must have passed a few. We don’t know what they are, so we fill in the most exciting “blackmail” type stuff: Satanic rituals, Masonic faggotry, Epstein tapes, etc. There’s no reason to believe it. Everyone knows a hundred names from the Lolita Express flight logs, and nobody *really* cares.It’s probably the pettiest shit. I know a guy who was kicked out of an important academic social circle for never taking his shoes off. He’s an ex-athlete with a permanent/perpetual foot injury that’s easily aggravated, so he’s worried about accidentally kicking anything. I happen to know both him and the person who made the final decision to ostracize him. When I explained the shoes to her, it was too late. The look of…rue? (Do people still rue?) It was visible. But the dude’s career is over forever and he’ll never understand why.

        The elites play a game called “Who Gets To Be The Greater Victim?”Female is better than male, because women are ever-suffering saints who have it so rough (even though as long as she retains a shred of looks she’ll be living on Easy Street).Black is better than white, because blacks are an oppressed underclass (even though there are fine jobs available as tokens across the world if you can act White).The “elites” are a bunch of petulant, ungrateful whiners who need to be forced to work in the Private Sector (at reduced pay) until they can see straight.

        Great post. I hadn’t thought of that.A difference in cultures where “saving face” is a thing is that the party in question will still be disciplined behind the scenes by a personal ingroup. Usually the family or tribe. This is what happens in East Asian cultures, the political boss who screws up and commits too much graft will be allowed to resign and retire, but then later on it will turn out that his son, who has seniority, for some reason is not going to inherit control of the family business.So the question would be are Nuland and her like going to be disciplined by their peers in some way.If your prediction is correct, and I suspect it is, and they are not so disciplined, then this isn’t really the Oriental model and probably isn’t going to last very long without any such feedback effects to mitigate future mistakes.

            In the case of people like Nuland, no.  She will not pay any price, unless you count going to a think tank and “earning” a seven figure salary is punishment.
She will get paid huge sums to produce useless research and articles in which she comes to the wrong conclusions. Those conclusions will be what is thought to be good for her tribe.

        I’m not sure who she’s been saving face from.  Everyone in her circle knows she screwed the pooch (or was screwed by the pooch if it could stand it).  I doubt one in a million normal people would even know who “Torie” nuland is, so they couldn’t care less.  Of course, self introspection among these elite turds is all but nonexistent.  But yeah, I’m sure her ugly mug will show up somewhere to pontificate on and elucidate us as to how Trump or Putin is destroying muh democracy.  CH’s (now nillas with attitude) gabsite had a pic of her back in the day vs now – whew, talk about hitting the wall – not bad looking in her early twenties, though…

                Interesting thought. ‘Course it applies pretty broadly to people across cultures, but it strikes me that “vampires” is probably a socially-acceptable characterization, particularly because it applies to most (all?) of our ruling class.
Ought to get past the censorship algos, and at least for a  while, the LLMs, too.

                I did not ever connect Bram Stoker’s vampires with “anti-semitism” but it’s indeed a thing and makes sense particularly given the time it was written.  But this all changed 20+ years ago with Buffy and the glamorization of vampires (no I have never watched that nonsense!).  Gone is the roughly Jewish image, the aversion to the cross and love of money.  They are apparently caring creatures nowadays.  What do you all make of that?

        Maybe I’m wrong, but after reading,  I am reminded of how the “elite” or famous people or whatever insist on doubling down on lying. Moreso over something trivial. Tell another lie and they can save face and maybe people move on. I thought about Jussie and Bill C. when reading this article. They are incapable of admitting they f-ed up or was wrong. The lies become bigger and more ridiculous, but as long as there is no -mea culpa- they remain unstained and clean.

        Nuland has caused the death of a million people ballpark in the Ukraine. I know on the Hitler Scale, this only hits a one out of six, but still. Yes, I know this is an antisemitism, but it doesn’t even amount to a penny’s worth on the HS. I’ve come to the conclusion that the tribe should not be allowed in government. Doctors, yes. Physicists and mathematicians, absolutely. Comedians? Perfection! But government only gets the not so smart Jews with a grudge. Not a good thing.

            Interesting observation, Major. It suggests that some people, maybe some groups, can have value in the advisory role, but are unfit for the command role. I can see  precedents for this in history and culture. A key distinction between the two roles would be accountability, which is a theme of Zman’s column today.
Of course, that would make our current regime—a rule by supposed experts—is a tremendous folly. And a lethally destructive one, as you note, and as we have seen.

            One Eastern European state, I forget which one, was powerful, successful, and lasting because of one simple law: no Jews allowed in government, law, finance, or academia.
On second thought, this might be why the shtetls are so single-mindedly bent on vengeance: reduced to farming and cobbling!! and then the Amish came in, also settlers as poor as they, and kicked their ass in out-farming them.
