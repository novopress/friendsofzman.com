        one thing you can always count on with conservatives, is that they will never have your back.  look at how even Trump allows his supporters to be attacked with impunity.  notice how KR-15 has been abandoned.  and that is why the left is going to succeed in their cause ‚Äì the absolute cowardice of everyone else.   note i include myself in this group, as doing anything meaningful on your own (e.g. shoot a judge is a guaranteed end to your life) without any support from the rest of the sheep.what will change things is when a new faction arises within the dem party.   the gop is now effectively dead.  if they can‚Äôt protect election results then what the hell do all those judges matter?  where are they now? no, the game is over; the left wins because it gets power, and the right gets what it loves most ‚Äì a good excuse to quit without fighting.as people here know, I am a big Trump supporter, but letting the election be stolen when you have 4 years to stop it, disqualifies anyone for my support.   what would have stopped it is killing in custody a dozen or so perps leading up to the election.  and arresting the supposed coup plotters.  no, Trump played 4D chess a little too long and now the game is over for him (and his family).  sadly, they will be forced into exile.

                            So strange. Cells of the 9-11 crew lived in both Atlanta and Oklahoma City at pertinent times. Thank gosh the eagle-eyed agencies were on both cases, ‚Äòcuz they protect the Murrican people.



Rudolph blew an empty abortion clinic after hours to save Fetal-American lives, of course this committed Christian would toss pipe bombs at sports events. Sure. I even saw it on TV shows, that‚Äôs what they‚Äôrereallylike.

Klan and Christians, they both usecrosses,and they talk funny.

                                Additionally, to your point. Rudolph had been hunted for years by the FBI at great expense. He avoided their dragnet by living the hardscrabble hand to mouth existence of a hybrid mountain man/hobo. He fared poorly and often resorted to dumpster diving to survive (warning to all you  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Rambo it all alone in the mountains when it hits the fan‚Äù types).It wasnt the vaunted FBI that bagged him. It was a newbie cop of a small department that sensed something weird about the bum he was watching and realized he‚Äôd gotten THE guy. I remember watching the press conference. It was clear the local police chief (Sheriff?) didnt like the Feds and the FBI and made sure his young hick cop got all the credit. The newbie cop was clearly uncomfortable and almost goofy looking but his story definitely excluded the FBI as having any part of the apprehension.

                                Americans who have done  like Rudolph so often go after the cape not the matador and think they can use the press to their advantage. Not smart.President Clinton understood that , in wartime any member of the press or person who speaks against you in a public way is the enemy and a lawful target.We are not at war as of yet of course and thus must respect the rights of such assholes to say their paid words but if it should go to guns , be smart.For now, stay frosty and as always Don‚Äôt Do Stupid Illegal Things (DDS IT)

            I‚Äôve been working on my family members over the years with some very modest success, and these are people who already agree with probably 85% of what I have to say.  When it comes to my neighbors, they‚Äôre pretty hopeless.  They‚Äôre good people, and that‚Äôs probably the issue, a more dark-hearted cynical lot would be easier to work with.And then there‚Äôs an experience the missus and I had last week.  We had stopped to help a young white woman who was having a severe car issue.  Always looking for a chance to proselytize:Me:‚ÄúHave any brothers or sisters?‚ÄùHer:‚ÄúOh yeah, seven, but they‚Äôre from different mothers and fathers and my mom abando‚Ä¶‚ÄùMe:[Never F‚Äôn mind, we‚Äôre doomed]And it‚Äôs not like she was a true hillbilly, her dad is a local white-collar professional of some sort.

Yes. That‚Äôs certainly been my experience. The nicer the folk, the less amenable they are to my conversion attempts. Of course, by now I can spot them a mile off.

As we should all be. It is if anything the most basic duty.

                    Therein lines some of the problem pointed out in the article. The combination of ‚ÄúNice people‚Äù with too much material comforts to lose, effectively dooms any attempt at‚Ä¶reform? Realignment? I saw this with my close friends who have an abundance of material comforts combined with young children. They were outraged at the election theft, and 48 hours later were rationalizing. They couldn‚Äôt stomach it longer than that.

Another believer elsewhere pointed out: the older message was first, to Fight Evil- so that then, we could practice Good.

                        right, but the end goal, is, after all, Heaven. I need reminding of that once in a while. Yes, we have a right to a homeland, but not at the expense of our eternal salvation. And it aint once saved always saved. Crossing the goal line the real struggle!

Me:I noticed the Trump sticker on your truck. Think they‚Äôre going to cheat this from us?
YNG:They‚Äôre gonna try. It‚Äôs bulls**t. I‚Äôm in the Navy and I can‚Äôt f***ing believe that there are so many people in the military who HATE him! Most don‚Äôt but waaaaay more than I thought.
Me:Did you notice they were mostly minorities?
YNG:Huh? Um‚Ä¶ yeah. Actually, you are right. Uh‚Ä¶ yeah.
Me:Have a good night and thank you for your service.

            Yes exactly.  That the communists would attempt to steal the  election was known and preventable years in advance.   The fact that the Trump team allowed it happen will go down as one of the great political blunders of our time.

            Depends on who is wielding the totalitarianism. If it‚Äôs the Washington establishment, then we get a pretty incompetent totalitarianism which we can live with, and exploit if necessary.

                    A genuine crack-town black guy that I follow on FB said that he never met president who cared two licks for his community and that they care more about some village in Afghanistan then his own.  Point being, they do have people within their community who have a clue, they do have agency and can help themselves if they so desire.  We have enough issues with our own people without having to worry about others who are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves.

            that‚Äôs the ironic part of all this.   communism eliminates (literally in most cases) all diversity.  everyone is on a 1:1 basis with the state, to the exclusion of all other allegiances and relationships.  it is like acid being spread across a society, breaking all bonds between individuals.

        That strong horse is about to be hobbled and its back broken if this stolen election is allowed to stand. All legitimacy for our ruling class will be toast. First obviously for the Deplorables and then gradually for everyone else as our standard of living continues its march into the abyss. They‚Äôll have to use Dominion to steal votes for the GOP in all future elections just to keep the charade somewhat believable since most true Americans will just stay home and refuse to play their game. The next true nationalist leader will not be elected but installed after much spilled blood.

            Agree. Some seem to think that the phrase, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not voting our way out of this,‚Äù means something like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to community organize our way out of this.‚Äù
There is only revolution, and that probably only works if Trump calls for it. That‚Äôs why talk here about forming communities is missing the point. To steal from Rumsfeld, you go to revolution with the community you have not the one you eventually want to build.

I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúcall for‚Äù anything at all, the Left brought us a revolution without me asking for it even one time.There is a tiny chance Trump prevails in court and the crisis is averted. Otherwise this ends in exactly two ways: 1) Trump dies in jail, 2) Trump seizes power.If 1, then your community will be choked to death in its crib. If 2, the guys who showed up in Richmond for the gun rights demonstrationmighthave some tiny role to play, but it‚Äôs all about the colonels who will or will not arrest some generals. That‚Äôs where we are and the idea that there is some sort of next phase where we regroup and get stronger and convince the normies what‚Äôs what is just wrong.

                                BTP,I understand your sky is falling feeling. Who knows, you may be right and this was the exact moment future historians will mark as lynchpin that wasnt pulled‚Ä¶ but those moments are much rarer in history than most people think, so probability says it is not. History is movement, accumulation,  decay, erosion, gradient.I‚Äôll put, and do place my marker on building community. Rescuing the like-minded and attracting others through an attractive alternative. Building redoubts that like decent little towns and counties. Places that can spread and eventually project power and change.You passed the first rule of combating an idea you dont care for by offering an alternative. That is respectable. I just think that all or nothing right now idea isn‚Äôt going to attract much in the way of followers and allows for no maneuver room if correction is required.Community building is a multigenerational endeavor and allows for those of us pursuing it and our descendants to maneuver and address issues and hurdles as they develop and from a position of ever growing strength and security.

                            This little argument between Lineman and BTP inspired me to a maxim: never let your hopes or expectations or even plans for the macro level get in the way of your preparations on the micro level.I used the terms ‚Äòmacro‚Äô and ‚Äòmicro‚Äô the way economists use them, macro is the national, or out of personal sphere level, micro is the private or personal sphere. Lineman is saying ‚Äòget busy at the micro level‚Äô, BTP is talking about the macro level. We all have hopes and desires at the macro level. But that should not cause us to neglect preparations at the micro level.

They had no African demographic ‚Äì mainly Russians, eastern euros and asiatics under their power.a better comparison might be South Africa, or Rhodesia.

If this were true, people like Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza and Dan Bongino would not have audience 1000x larger than the biggest names on the dissident right. What‚Äôs obvious to us is not obvious to most people.

                        The only pundit I know of with relevance who has not shifted into a more dissident position in the last four years is Shapiro, and that‚Äôs only because of the inertia of a massive years long propaganda network propping him up.  Beck is now a circus clown, Levin has gone hardline voter fraud where it will be hard to backpedal without destroying his credibility, and Limbaugh is essentially a corpse to be replaced by a new guard.If Bongino starts to get mogged on his own platform(Parler) with dissident viewpoints, he‚Äôll see where the wind is blowing and start shifting.Some of these guys have enough money and ego where they will not tolerate being forced to echo the same weak mantras from their masters.

                            Shapiro and Levin are the thin end of the ‚ÄúJews are just white guys‚Äù wedge that the mainstream media is pushing now.  Since their fellow tribalists ultimately want to cement that status, they are given a much longer rope than most ordinary white people would be given.

                        ‚ÄúSeems like the message from that camp is vote harder, pray harder and don‚Äôt look over the wall.‚ÄùOn the left, this is presented as a morality play. Z-you pointed this out. White people falling on their knees waving their arms in the air to the black and brown deity, and that‚Äôs just part of the morality play. Plus Gia worship. Lefty morality from all 4 directions. The secular zombies are empty souls, stuffing their deep void with the globalist inverted morality. Z wrote about fanatics and the fanatics spring from the globohomo Gia religion of the global left.We offer pushback‚Ä¶not morality. Holding on to The Family is pushback, blocking immigration is pushback. Until a more attractive Dissident morality play arises, we lose and stagger along.White People will have to descend into great suffering and loss, witness the globohomo religion fail to protect them, face danger and persecution, and witness the religion of the left fail to fill them before reality forces their hand.I‚Äôm grateful that Trump smashed up the structure. That‚Äôs a good starting point. 70 million people watched the election get stolen and will remember. Destruction before creation.Work to keep your gyroscope spinning and aligned for you and your family. Be strong and lead by wisdom. Keep to your own. Now is not our We shall inherit The World time. People struggle in our DR to create dissident structure, and it is not yet its time. Have hope for they become more Stupid, literally, by the day, and over time it will be obvious they can‚Äôt keep the wheels from coming off or fix their chit and stuff. Reality will return but not in the timeline you wish for or imagine. You will know. Now we walk in stress and anxiety, and must cultivate patience to keep living and moving forward. You will recognize when the time is ripe and the tide turns.That by which men think, we create the world around us.

                        Bongino wears his heart on his sleeve and that resonates with a quietly raging Middle America in need of a champion. And he‚Äôs cashing in big time. What is truly scary about his message is that if the Elites succeed in stealing the election for Biden, Bongino thinks he can change the next election by more and better community organizing. How do you do that when rigging elections becomes the new normal? Stupid is as stupid does.

                            The better route would be to declare ‚Äúdemocratic voting‚Äù a fraud, promote boycott, and then challenge TPTB to completely overall the system to prove otherwise.
This of course will never happen, but it will ‚Äúcover‚Äù his move to the dissident right and pull a lot of his questioning viewers over who follow him.  He‚Äôs one of the few who could believably make this work.  The question is, does he believe such in his heart?

                            What choice does he have?  DB is plugged into the system and makes his living on the system. So do the others.Also let me ask you directly? Are you actually revolution ready?Didn‚Äôt think so. Ultimately we all know that the system doesn‚Äôt work, can‚Äôt be fixed under almost any circumstances other than a Pinochet or DR takeover and will break down at some point into a much less complex one.The only other option is to impose our  ideology on people just like the Woke are trying to do.What they are trying to accomplish is wrong because its chaotic and dishonest but what they are trying to do , create a new  order by force is morally sound.Bad ideas, right action.And note to recovering Libertarians, the goal isn‚Äôt freedom. The goal is a stable order for families and that means less freedom.Until we get an ideology and  hard enough to do the unthinkable, that is  to  force people to behave the way we want them to, we have no other choice than to vote harder.And to note in case anyone doesn‚Äôt get this, unless we get that Pinochet,a  bottom up revolution will be an immediate atrocity spiral leading to millions dead in the US, a global famine and probably a Chinese hegemon.The DR can win, can rebuildb after  but its a long difficult multi generational slog and not to put to fine a point on it, we are far too soft, lazy and accustomed to peace. Its not going to be easy to go Ultra-Nationalist or Authoritarian Right.

                    Stop living in 1999 please, The youngest Boomers are well over 50 and while they can be a benefit on an individual basis, they aren‚Äôt that important as a group. Most are like 70+ BTW old in other words and  not that long till they are all gone.Who matters are the newly turning White Millennial‚Äôs (now +11% Republican) and the Zeds who are what 18 now? They are the future not the aging Boomers.Honestly sometimes I think our movement needs 40K style Commissars, some dude in a Tricorn Hat and a Frock Coat  or something armed with a cattle prod  yelling ‚ÄúFocus on the future you want to build.‚Äù  ‚Äúno looking backwards to the past‚Äù ‚Äúits 2020, current year numbskull .‚Äù and anyone not looking forward, building forward gets a zap in the nuts ‚ÄúFace forward dipshit.‚ÄùAnd yes I get this is the Right,we like tradition. Things have changed and we need to build something that works not try to raise a dead society from its grave.Its not coming back, the people that built it are  all  dead . What we can do is  build a society based on proven principles for the people that live here now.It will be gayer, more porny, a bit more beclowned and less Christian for quite some time  but it will be Whiter/Righter and work well enough. In time we can make it even better and fertility alone will make it more religious.So face forward troops. A bright tomorrow awaits. Or something.

                    This isn‚Äôt a race war at least not yet,Besides Civ Nattery is just less scary for most people  its easier to assume you can maybe deport a few people, lock up some others  and have a common culture than assume you have to go Serbo-Croatia on everyone who looks too different than you.Honestly even I think a Whites and Friends (10-20% max) nation would be able to work to some degree  without habitual criminals, and immigration.Problem is to get there requires our current elite be removed from power, mass repatriation  and strong force be used to control institutions of all sorts.The idea of being an ideology monitor for under 21 education , arresting business leaders for promoting illegal ideologies or running a labor camp may seem appalling but unless you have the ability to make it happen and are willing to do this, you will get subverted.Changing from the Liberty minded BS we have to outright  authoritarianism  won‚Äôt be easy. Its theoretically possible to win elections for this but with the vote rigging? Mass immigration?Now Civ Nats think there is some magic Non Aggression Principle or well of good will that will allow a higher functioning  society. This is a definitive no.You make people behave. You don‚Äôt want drug dealers?  You hang the 19 year old kid dealing drugs at the local college, sorry Madison , Middle Class White Girl or Not  its the noose  or at the very least give them 5 years hard labor.Woke isn‚Äôt strong the way the Black Piller Guest in the last thread thought, it does understand this very point. Power is Truth and while Power isn‚Äôt The Truth, you can make a lot of people swallow lies. Used for Truth? Its even stronger.Our job if we were willing to accept it is to rebuild a moral order largely by forcing people to behave morally and honestly for an interregnum.20-40 years of ‚Äòdo as I say asshole.‚Äù so long as its a decently correct thing  would lead to a functional society. It doesn‚Äôt promise more kids being born or happiness but its clean, safe, orderly and functional if you can pull it off.When we embrace this by whatever means, elections preferred  and  are willing to think on those lines, we‚Äôll be able to play offense if we wish . If we can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt than the best we can do is survive as the system falls apart.

                        abprosper,Draconian, but workable. I don‚Äôt even know if your ratcheted down society would even be wearisome to people after they became accustomed to it. They don‚Äôt seem particularly put out now by their loss of free elections, privacy or economic choice.They may just appreciate a country without the crime, decay, obvious racial tension, corporate anti-white propaganda, general ugliness, clown universities, etc.You‚Äôve essentially laid out a reboot of the 1950s minus the civnat/civic rights pitfall Our predecessors fell into. Americans time-machined from the 1950s wouldn‚Äôt see it as an all that strange future. Better gadgets, check. Still ferreting out commies and degenerates, check. Civil misbehavior gets you hauled before a judge, check. Refer addicts and their peddlers are a menace rarely seen but be on the look out(!), check.There‚Äôs even room for a small controlled number of approved and time tested amenable amount of digestible diversity.The only notable thing that your 1950s future travelers might mention is that they really thought we‚Äôd have flying cars and silver onesies by now.

                            Good catches there. I try to think in terms of older  established law when possible and the doctrine of En Loco Parentis allows tight ideological control over colleges without violating the 1st amendment.Marriage is also easy to fix, easy divorce with no kids but little to no alimony, default to male custody and hard divorce with  kids.A couple of say 23 year olds with no children or some people with grown children  really  shouldn‚Äôt need to jump through hoops.Really the only moral issues that can‚Äôt be fixed by a cram down rollback are porn, which is ubiquitous (99% of guys, 85% of women admit to using it) and weed,I‚Äôm not sure porn is actually a moral issue but it any case it is  too widely used to do anything about.Modern high potency weed which is legal here in Cali among other places is a  health menace though and needs to go. I think simply allowing fairly safe stuff like ditch weed , maybe X and a few others would serve to reduce harm.I don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôd really like all drugs except beer wine and soft liquor gone but I‚Äôm sane enough to know that failed last time and nothing is crazier than trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results.The trick though is puting ot together and getting Free-Dumb loving Merikans to help with the cram down.I have only one tiny quibble with your post, People are extremely pissed about the elections. There were like 400K Trump supporters on the ground for the Million Maga March and I see pop up protests here in Cali all the time.The media is as usual covering it up.Right now its the ‚Äúlet the courts sort it out‚Äù phase which is fine because the only other options are take it up the backside or ‚Äúsafeties  off, weapon‚Äôs hot.‚ÄùThe last options is certainly preferable to just taking it but we really aren‚Äôt ready for the costs.

                                You may be right on the election fraud. Time will tell. It‚Äôs a draw in my mind as to whether American‚Äôs 60 day memory loss will kick in or this has corroded the franchise institution permanently. I don‚Äôt see it as the spark that sets it off now, but I‚Äôll admit that in a past thread I argued contemporaries rarely ever see the spark when it occurs.I‚Äôll disagree on two points. Pornography, which I think you and I went around with before so no need to hash that fully again. I admit that it will be present, but I‚Äôd make any new producers, purveyors and participants such a hunted and persecuted species that Torquemada would say chill zealot. Possesion of anything produced prior to a certain date would be amenable to fines and probably rarely enforced. Any new production would meet the draconian level of decades long incarceration. The sinful portion doesn‚Äôt really concern me, that‚Äôs between the consumer and God, and can be forgiven. My concern is keeping young white men and women away from that industry and the lifelong destruction it inevitably causes.Second, hard liquor. In your world, I‚Äôll be running booze so may end up in the clink. I have a genetic weakness to scotch. Not drunkenness, it‚Äôs just that smooth warm taste is worth the risk of ending up in a cell.

                                    These differences are why we can‚Äôt legislate some things.And I remember our porn discussion but sufice it to say you have not a single police officer or soldier willing to enforce that edict . Its a lost cause and frankly I‚Äôm not sold in its harmfulness anyway,The ‚Äúick‚Äù reflex , aka instinctive revulsion is strong  in many Conservatives but that isn‚Äôt a rational reason to ban anything.I loathe scotch and the effect of hard liquor  and it sometimes causes harm but the harm level is low enough, value of adult choice and   the enforcement cost high enough that the greater good is served by not having laws against it.I mercifully  forgot about abortion as an issue earlier. My personal preference is that medical and eugenic abortion and non hormonal birth control be strongly encouraged and free but hormonal birth control  and birth control abortions banned , the later at least after the first trimester if not entirelyThis sounds cruel but the fewer Down‚Äôs Syndrome or other deformed babies in the gene pool the better.

                                        There are plenty of cops that make arrests for child pornography, production and possession, worldwide. I am not equating adult pornography and child porn in its level of pure evil, rather saying it is prosecuted.

                                            This is more for anyone else reading this. You and I enjoyed a good scrap over this before.You are unintentionally promoting a  categorization fallacy. Sure they are both about sexual stimulation  but no one frowns on adults doing it.CP  is illegal not only because its disgusting but  because no matter what pedos think  children cannot consent to the acts portrayed  and such acts harm the child and society. Its rape.Normal porn OTOH almost no one thinks its disgusting enough to ban , adult performers can in fact consent and have agency to do so. Also there isn‚Äôt proof that porn causes harm and may even reduce adult rape.Also important quite a few nations have banned or controlled porn of late with exactly zero effect on fertility.Simply the  harm from a law against something everyone uses greatly outweighs any possible gains especially in a secular society.And while there were a couple of arrests under obscenity laws  under Bush JR both were involved tangentially with CP , one involving a porn movie scene in a gonzo flick joking about bringing on an under age performer and the other a women writing child porn.Her case never went to trial and was plead as a misdemeanor no sex offense and temp ban from the Internet, She didn‚Äôt even do time.That was more than ten years ago, closer to 20 and porn is even more acceptable now.More importantly, if the DR takes over a huge chunk of the population will probably have guerilla warfare experience. It may even be difficult to enforce homicide or theft laws   in some cases. Hell it may be  nigh impossible to enforce victimless crime laws even as say making and arrest may end up with brutal retaliation against the police.Pedophiles will just end up dead in a ditchA blooded population of killers won‚Äôt be lawless but you can‚Äôt police them without consent either at least not a high cost.That is why societies always try to disarm former militants and why militants should always refuse that request.A well trained well armed people with a taste for self governance is freer than most.

                                                This is a good discussion.  I think AB here is focusing a bit too much on the ‚Äúcrackdown‚Äù aspects of the change we want though.  As I see it the main problems in our society are not so much created by ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù as by perverse incentives, particularly those directed at women.The porn discussion is a good example.  Porn is one aspect of a much wider problem, which is that we‚Äôve built a society that allows young women, particularly if they are at all attractive, to basically glide through life.  They start by ‚Äúearning‚Äù worthless college degrees, financed through government backed loans (IOW, taxes collected from productive men).  The corporate and governmental worlds then reward them with makework jobs that pay vastly better than the work available to most young men.  Finally, the immense online sex industry provides many with a lucrative side or even main income on top of all this.  For women unwilling to actually perform sex acts there is now also a quasi-porn industry of Twitch, OnlyFans, Instagram, etc‚Ä¶ where women become ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù paid by thirsty simps to cavort in skimpy outfits or pretend interest in them.When he‚Äôs done with that, he goes off to his ‚Äúessential‚Äù job earning shit wages at Amazon or some other giant company.  They lavish a lot of the profit they make from his labor on women they hire as HR or marketing drones whose job it is to think up ways to oppress or humiliate him.  Finally, he drives home over potholed roads that his taxes should be paying to fix.  Instead the government is spending money paying women to staff ‚ÄúDepartments of Diversity‚Äù or, nowadays, to just ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù.  Other women are paid by the government to mis-educate and indoctrinate children in the nation‚Äôs decrepit public schools.All across the society, you see the same phenomenon.  There is a small core of mostly male productive workers, laboring either with hands or brains or both, supporting a vast army of females engaged in activities that are at best frivolous and at worst hugely destructive.The phenomenon also has had a runaway positive feedback aspect to it.  As more women have been ‚Äúempowered‚Äù in the workplace, their natural hypergamy has made average men ‚Äúessentially non-essential‚Äù for them.  The coercive side of this game (state and corporation working together) is further amplified by the non-coercive process where lonely men essentially pay for virtual prostitutes through the internet.  This of course, provides even more wealth for women with which to become even more aloof from all but the most ‚Äúalpha‚Äù men.The ultimate problem is not that people have too much freedom but that they lack the freedom to operate outside this system of perverse incentives.  Even the drug problem can be seen as an attempt by young men to look for a tax-free income that is also free of the ever increasing humiliations of ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù work.  Drug consumption also provides a form of cheap recreation in a society that has become increasingly totalitarian.My point here isn‚Äôt that everything is economics and will be fixed by muh free market.  It is that the root problem is the system of incentives we have created.  Cracking down on the ways people deal with the problems those incentives create is likely to fail.  The crackdown part shouldNOTbe phase 1 but phase 2.Phase 1 should focus on getting creative about finding ways for men to build strength, character, skills, and income outside the State-Corporation.  This will weaken these entities and lead to fewer avenues for women to find easy employment within them.  Initially, this will expand the porn/quasi-porn industries but will also cause the already low prices for those things to crash.  This will lead increasing numbers of young women to strongly re-consider marriage and family.By the way, you may notice that I haven‚Äôt used much of a WN angle here.  The reason for that is that really anything that applies to women can apply to minorities as well.  There‚Äôs a reason white women are the political allies of blacks and Jewish totalitarians trying to build a coercive utopia.  All of them together thrive when white men are enslaved and made to work to support them.  I‚Äôd also like to say that AB‚Äôs ‚Äúwhites and friends‚Äù idea can be integrated into this framework too. With strict immigration controls and the abolition of affirmative action there‚Äôs no reasonproductive, law abiding, property owning blacks and hispanics can‚Äôt have a place as long as freedom of association is part of the deal too.  I welcome your thoughts on all this.

                                                    Glad you joined in. I‚Äôve ignored the economic problem simply because imposing the kind of regulation required to stop it is incredibly destructive and would probably be resisted.Simply put, do to automation driven efficiency  and the Internet and the demand barrier (one can only use so much stuff) there isn‚Äôt that much productive work to do.And yes we can gradually cut off trade and return to the way it was a century agowhere everything is made, sold and bought here, it will take time. The reason being simply we lack the ability to make a lot of things.While there is a lot of work for us cleaning up the previous societies proverbial and actual messes, its  not enough.Nor do I think any pretty young girls are going to get married young even if well heeled men are there unless we outright dictate from above certain kinds of jobs not exist.A last think, freedom of association only makes sense when you have overwhelming political control. Otherwise revanchist White Cucks will use it on you.

Believe it or not, I do not want a theocracy and view most sin/grace as a very personal thing. My litmus tests are, does that sin realistically reach beyond the participant and inhibit the good in others, and is it destructive for My People.

                                    Exactly.Normal potency weed is a decent medical/recreational plant though personally even though legal I won‚Äôt touch it with a ten foot stick.Same with shrooms, mescaline  and the like. Not harmful enough to prohibit and the old ‚Äúmust be sober for the factory state‚Äù argument of the past is highly deprecated. These days half of all jobs you coudl come in frying in acid and no one would notice a decline in productivity.

                D‚ÄôSouza, Bongino, et al. are the prozac of CivNats. Easier to drift in a stupor of colorblind hope that assimilation and Western values will turn these dusky fellows into khaki-wearing Whites in dark face than accept reality.
And the reality is harsh. Not only have you been wrong your entire life. Your mistake ‚Äì caused some combination of hubris and sloth ‚Äì has doomed your country, your children and grandchildren and your people. It‚Äôs not surprising that most CivNat Whites prefer to stay in denial and turn to various voices tell them that they‚Äôre going to be okay.

                    Yeah, when you bring that up to civnats they give some vague answer like ‚Äúwell, I think it will work out‚Äù or ‚Äúwell, when I was young we had italian/lebanese/polish immigrants and yeah, there was some conflict but now they‚Äôre just like us‚Äù.

                        Ah, the CivNat/Boomer shrug. I‚Äôve seen it many times. It‚Äôs a physical ‚Äúwashing of their hands‚Äù of facing the reality.

                            The time to worry is when the highly capable start emigrating from the country.


An in-between warning sign is when there are capital controls where you are free to leave your country but your money must stay at home. This is exactly what Cuba and South Africa did.


The time to really worry is when the host government makes departure impossible or very difficult to do so. By that point we are full on Soviet Union.

                                Pray tell, where would the highly capable Whites emigrate to? I assume no non-White nation. But few to none, White nations are less than a few years behind us.

                                There are a few mixed grandkids out there but the vast, vast majority of Whites prefer to breed with their own. The ones that don‚Äôt aren‚Äôt enough to matter, at least at the moment, and may be helpful to cull the herd.
I‚Äôve always believed that we‚Äôll ‚Äúlose‚Äù at least half of American Whites in one way or the other (no kids or mixing) over the next century or so. But the Whites remaining will be far more genetically conservative and ethnocentric. They‚Äôll also have known the pain of ethnic oppression.
They‚Äôll be a much smaller but far tougher cohort.

Oh and Pacific Islander who are stable.Its only immigration that is a threat long term that is  if you don‚Äôt mind  secualr modernity being taken  out behind the proverbial chemical shed and shot.Future USA after the ethnic mess is done will be super weird and its plausible that it may have a plurality of Old German speaking, low tech  agrarian Whites with a decent size of all other groups especially very devout Christians.What you aren‚Äôt getting , bar a Dissident Right takeover is a space future. We probably won;t have cheap energy anyway and technology and the corresponding population to maintain it will decline.

But having some ability to control an organization or institution could be useful as other organizations or institutions start to falter. Use every tool available.

            The soviet union was not openly pushing an anti-white agenda, nor were they importing millions of hostile foreigners.
They were doing both.
They burned down Christian churches while synagogues were protected.
And while they might not have imported millions of foreigners, they had enough poc inside the Soviet Union to effect the same; Stalin deliberately drew regional borders that went across traditional ethnic territories, and he moved tribes around in an effort to forge the Homo Sovietticus. That‚Äôs why the ‚Äòstans are a mess today and why you have a substantial Korean population living north of the Black Sea.

Thanks for the laugh.
The ‚Äúsoviets‚Äù were merely the vehicle. It would behoove you to inquire into who was behind the ‚Äúsoviets‚Äù.The Frankfurt School for example wasn‚Äôt financed by ‚Äúsoviets‚Äù. A two minute search should be sufficient to disabuse you of that notion.

                True. However, there was no unremitting anti-white propaganda campaign as there is in the US. The Soviets attacked tradition, which wasipso factowhite, in order to cement communist power. The AWRs attack whitesquawhites, in order to subjugate them and elevate PoC, particularly blacks. The two are quite different in their methods and goals.

Some dude once asked some African dude why they kept voting the same thieves into power again and again.

                African blacks have a certain simple practical attitude and simple real-world make-do way of going about things that is lost on the West.  There is not much we can take from their culture, but plainly seeing what is in front of them and personally making it work for them, as much as possible, is one thing.  Community (as defined by extended family) is a strong economic and physical protection strategy they practice as well.

            We have been conditioned for generations to think a third party is a bad idea. The natural divide in new America was north and south, so there was no real need for a third party. After the Civil War, the new divide was between the two sides of the Yankee ruling elite. That has remained in place even as the Yankee ruling elite gave way to the Judeo-Puritan ruling elite. The trouble is. most whites have no representation in that elite and never will.

                We have been conditioned for generations to think a third party is a bad idea.
That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs not a bad idea.
With proportional representation, it‚Äôs fairly easy to start a new party, get a platform. But long before your party reaches any significant size, there‚Äôll be a knock on your door‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not even sure it‚Äôs more expensive to buy eight parties than to buy two. More players means more opportunities to pit them against each other, drive down the price.
Also, with proportional representation, Trump would have lost bigly in 2016.

                    The problem is in thinking you can vote your way out of the problems of democracy. Once you grasp that, third party politics takes on a different color. A third party, for example, that was willing to endorse an official candidate that met their criteria, but otherwise sit out, turns the process on its head. This is what the Conservative Party of New York did for years. The Green Party pulled the Democrats far over to the Left.

                        A better paradigm is an organization like the NRA that supported people of whichever party supported their positions.  There used to be a lot of democrats that received their endorsements and it was the reason they were so effective.

        They rebel, either because the alternative is misery and death or they see some better option on the table.That‚Äôs the key. In most political debates I‚Äôve been witness to, most people ‚Äì who were in fact right ‚Äì never really presented anything that was tangible enough to Mr Normal to get him onside. The status quo was better. This is also the problem with daft phrases like ‚Äòleft‚Äô and ‚Äòright‚Äô or when someone identifies as a ‚Äòsocial conservative‚Äô ‚Äì they don‚Äôt mean that much to people.But there are points that we can rally around, that don‚Äôt send people running for the hills. Many of them. First, family. The average person wants any family they have to at least be in a safe area; which leads to the next point ‚Äì law and order. You note that the Soviets had minimal petty crime (certainly no happy slapping or head bricking from joggers) and to be fair this is, as we know, not something to scoff at. I use to know a few older Russians, I guess they‚Äôd now be in their 70s, and all of them were staggered at the amount of ‚Äòethnic‚Äô crime ‚Äì and street crime in general ‚Äì in the UK. It was almost like they couldn‚Äôt evenunderstand it.For me, the priority remains increasing my skill set and looking to purchase land in decent areas, having a family, followed by warning others. It is true that in both our countries the political system is screwed, but at times what remains of the functioning institutions can still be helpful. But as always, the number one question on my mind is: ‚ÄòWhen is enough enough? What am I prepared to die for?‚Äô. I may still be found out to be coward yet, but plug on regardless.Good essay.

            Good for you! You will not prove to be a coward, but some may see a prudent man that way. Ignore them! Once you have a family, it will all become wonderfully clear to you what truly counts and what doesn‚Äôt.

        There are parallels to the soviet situation, but a lot of differences as well.  Your average Russian hadn‚Äôt known any serious freedoms for decades, if not centuries.  They also endured two catastrophic world wars and criminality vile dictatorships who as said didn‚Äôt hesitate to use maximum force to quell any disturbances.  We‚Äôve lived mostly the opposite situation here in the states ‚Äì freedom, material wealth and pretty easy living for the most part ‚Äì oh, and we‚Äôre also armed to the teeth for what it‚Äôs worth.  And the deep state has thus far been loath to use any extreme force on any dissent factions other than picking off a few individuals here and there.  It mostly seems to rely on deplatforming, doxing,  social ostracization and now the covid  to keep folks in line.  I guess time will tell how long we put up with it ‚Äì maybe forever.

        The point has been made, perhaps even here, that revolutions are the work of factions in the ruling elite. They may enlist the peasants, but they are really warring among themselves. The Soviet Union is a good example. Gorbachev started it, and he and everyone one else was a member of the Soviet elite.
Trump failed not because the people didn‚Äôt follow him, they did (but not enough), but because he couldn‚Äôt recruit enough people from the elites. The true revolutionary and populist will have to arise in the Ruling Class.

                Again, maybe a little tiny bit of a white pill, but it seems like others have seen what Trump has done and realized they could do the same, but better, but cannot while Trump is there (Ted Cruz comes to mind, but there are others).  I certainly hope Trump pulls it out, but were I an ambitious pol I‚Äôd probably keep those cards close to the vest and probably not make much more than a cursory defense of Trump who is notoriously unreliable.If this is true, then the more likely it is that Trump doesn‚Äôt pull it out, the more spirited the defense from these contenders since they will want both cred and Trump gone.

            bob sykes, you nailed it.  Revolutions are factions of elites turning on each other.  In the meantime, Normie sees no viable alternative to the status quo, the angry right can‚Äôt identify any targets, and some of us withdraw to our own communities.  From our communities, we nurture our own, and watch and wait while the elites gin up Clownworld.  When the elites begin to turn on each other, we will see our opportunity and do something to further things along.  But not until then.

                Then again, maybe we are just pawns with the unenviable ability to watch all this drama, impotently. Glad I‚Äôm a Catholic! Then I realize being persecuted is kinda a good, evern if its not directly for being a Christian.
But my suspicion is all the White hatred is hatred of Catholicism, and the West it created. Our world came out of the medieval world, no? A world that was a unified Catholic empire. And, even though Catholicism is by definition, well, catholic, it was a White European phenomenon mostly.

        One reason Russians tolerated the misery of communism was that Russians were and are habituated to very hard times. Russian history, with its Mongol enslavement, its Time of Troubles, its poverty and serfdom, is a tale of almost unremitting hardship and political violence. Communism was simply one variation on a very old and well known theme.

        The fact that the Hungarians and Czechs and Poles rebelled against communist oppression while the Russians tolerated it, has much to do with innate nationalism. People can withstand bullying as long as the bully is one of them. However, when the oppressor is alien‚Äìin this case, Russian‚Äìthe hegemony becomes insufferable. And this should provide whites in ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù with some hope. Increasingly, whites are being ruled by blacks and their proxies via an explicitly anti-white fascist Power Structure. At some point, and perhaps sooner rather than later, this dynamic will become so vexatious whites that they revolt in order to throw off the Negro Yoke. What form this revolt takes is anybody‚Äôs guess.

            That‚Äôs another important point. The political structure increasingly simply lacks the human capital necessary to keep whitey oppressed. Hans could do it, but they have a very low birth rate and by about 2030 few will be leaving China‚Ä¶ the asian/Indian importation seems to be trying to import intelligent people who could help the state function. Indians are basically their only possibility long term. But I question their abilities.

        Though I can agree the trade off applies to many people, I do not think it applies to most. I believe most are so befuddled due to years of prescription drugs, horrid educational system, and TV/Smartphone addiction, that they are unable to formulate a consistent lens of experience that would enable them to exist concurrently with but against the propaganda. With such short attention spans and limited ability to think critically, they are unable to sustain a personal narrative that says ‚ÄúThis is a big lie‚Äù against the unending loudspeaker of fear.

            To be clear ‚Äì I mean people in the current, American system. Certainly material comforts have allowed this intellectual lassitude, but the problem as it manifests really comes down to inability to grasp a couple key concepts. First, you can present them with the words of our overlords, such as Schwab, that literally map out that they are parlaying any virus issue into an opportunity to reset the system. Books on esoterica, stuff I have been reading all my life, have long pointed out the desire to dissolve and re-coagulate society alchemically. However, most people (and I deal with hundred of people a day), simply lack the imagination that the people at the top see the world differently than us peons.However, what is additionally problematic, besides this lack of imagination, is the inability to hold onto internal truths despite external pressure. I can point out that masks probably do no good. They can agree. I can point out that if there was never a single news article on Covid, you wouldn‚Äôt know it even existed. This was not true of real pandemics. They can agree. I can point out that our rulers are inept. They can agree. I can point out that everyone they know who tested positive is 100 percent fine, at worst a mild fever. They can agree. However, when it comes to ‚Äòcan you carry that belief around consistently‚Äô, most cannot. Some do fear punishment, yes. But most simply passively accept it, largely ignore it, and repeat party slogans. The prospects are dim ‚Äì way dimmer than if it is just a trade-off. Just take it ‚Äì and take it till you accept it. Because people have spent so much of their life opening and shallowing themselves in social media, they do not have the internal fortitude to resist the insertion of propaganda into the mind and what‚Äôs left of a soul.

        And what is the positive, alternative, vision? Freedom of association is simply racist, strong families is code for misogynist and xenophobic haters (don‚Äôt you love your GDP, hater?)None of that changes the facts: the state is illegitimate, the elites are illegitimate. They have no rights. The ability to shift opinion is rapidly going away. ‚ÄúThe people‚Äù didn‚Äôt rally to Yeltsin‚Äôs side so much as a commander of some battalion of tanks in Moscow decided to switch sides.

There have been billboards in this area highlighting brown people and women for these positions for several years. This fella could be trained for repetitive tasks only. The electrical unions in this state must bend to the diversity gods if they want to maintain fat government contracts and the protections they currently have.  Undoubtedly many of the older white guys in these jobs now know the grids will fail more frequently and take longer to repair. California type brown outs are just one consequence. There will be more.

                It will. Everything between now and then matters only because it will get them to act or not act. The more obvious the fraud is, the more likely they act. But it seems to me that Trump has to be the one to tell them to act. If not, then not.

            It just can‚Äôt happen. The military is too politically mixed and there‚Äôs too much to lose by pulling that kind stunt. The French Algerian OAS example is pertinent. The French even had a recent history of coloring outside the lines, there were still guys running around who were in the resistance and Free French forces, supported by a rock ribbed civilian population who were more hardcore than Ulster Loyalists, as well as many sympathisers on the mainland. They just couldn‚Äôt pull it off.

                A not-very-well written article on the possible impending genocide made a good point that the military will be made to sit this out.  Even in a place like Venezuela the military is made to do make-work or prepare for an invisible enemy while street enforcers and occasionally the police do the dirt suppression work.

        I tend to be of two minds on a lot of this stuffWhat I cannot get past is this.   I simply don‚Äôt believe the likes of Hillary Clinton, Warren, Bernie, Kamala, etc are CAPABLE enough to bring about the future we fear.  The can barely run a campaign.  And although they are tyrannical by nature, they are shallow and pretty stupid.  And they‚Äôre almost all dead.So part of me finds it implausible that they could accomplish much of anything.  Yes, they are successful at the soft tyranny. But that‚Äôs easy.  Just tell cops to harass people or be fired. Or corporations to hire trannies or have the IRS on their ass.   So what I think I‚Äôm seeing is a situation where the natural opposition still doesn‚Äôt take the opposition seriously, hence the slumber.But‚Ä¶.at the same time, the people who would be the natural opposition, say the patriotic sorts have really been dumbed down quite a bit.  I remember growing up how the southerners were pretty effective at keeping the yankee transplants from taking over.   I thought, sure, illegals can take over California, but wait until they try that crap in the south.  But where are those same people I knew growing up?  Why did their resolve weaken and they surrender?   Illegals are rampant everywhere in the south now.So maybe we really are in a situation where we simply lack the stuff to fight off even idiots like the current Dems?  Maybe the opposition itself has become just as stupid.Perplexing to say the least.

                Part of me thinks all of these politicians and ideologues are just wannabes who have zero chance of creating their socialist utopia, and there has to be intelligent people out there in the world who are well aware of it. I doubt Putin or Xi take any of them very seriously and just humor them and get what they can out of them. No one in our country has been successful at really anything in the past 25 years. What have they done ? Obamacare? LOL. They couldn‚Äôt even do that  with the entire insurance industry helping. Couldn‚Äôt win a war against goat herders. And the other big effort was the TSA, a total failure and one I even forgot the initials of and had to just look up.They succeed in their own way merely because no one challenges them. One man did, Trump, and it took every single last one of them working int total unison just to get him out of the way. Imagine if there were only 500 hundred dedicated people trying to thwart them.

            Obviously, the politicians that we have foisted upon us are promoted and selected by the party donors ‚Ä¶ Trump being the exception.  I still contend that He wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen ‚Ä¶ a glitch in the matrix, if you will.  The ‚Äúothers‚Äù either agree with the program, or know what they need to do.  The #1 goal is to smash any chance of White Nationalism rising up in the USA.  This would result in TPTB being exposed and ran out on a rail, a la pre-WWII Germany.

        ‚ÄúAn under appreciated subplot to the Trump phenomenon is that Trump represented disorder and uncertainty, while his establishment opponents became stability and order.‚Äù
I cannot agree. The establishment, with its BLM and Antifa brownshirts, its riots, looting and arson, represent disorder and uncertainty. This is why Trump didn‚Äôt send in the National Guard; he wanted to force the establishment to own its own chaos. Alas, it appears as though roughly half of voters in the US prefer social turmoil and mass violence to stability, security and order. Irrationality is a powerful force in human affairs.

            They voted for order, feeling/knowing in the back of their head that the left will now ‚Äúturn it off,‚Äù as well as the order they will feel is restored by not having a NYC real estate developer popping off on twitter. A shocking amount seem to feel its too hard to turn off the news cycle, and they can bury their head again now and leave it running in the background like the good old days. The amount of people who fatigued from the twittering and the storms it brought seems notable in my circles.

        Easy sell: stability. It‚Äôs pretty obvious the establishment is no longer capable of providing it.

The hard part is speaking the hard truths and paying the price for it. Multiculturalism is a failure. Democracy can‚Äôt work for diverse populations with diverse interests. The less people have in common, the more they fight, the less freedom and stability.

But yeah, the plan of action. Those mostly white Trump rallies in contrast to BLM/antifa riots speak loudly. Then the censorship to keep people from seeing them. That‚Äôs chess. Like Trump said in ‚Äò16, we have to punch through the media lies.

        The problem with Eastern Europeans is one of fatalism.  ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs always been shitty so more shit.‚Äù  Poverty isn‚Äôt just a disease of the stupid, but one of people with low expectations.  For themselves.  For their kids.  For their neighbors.  This is why leftism triumphs in most cultures.  It‚Äôs an excuse making machine for failure.  An endless one.  Right down to ancestry, which makes it even more of a religion that worships tortured ancestors.    The primary goal of leftists in this country, or any is to blow open the gates and let every squatter peasant in from every corner of the earth.  We can ONLY hope that they system itself fails, this complex social bribery system from Medicaid to SNAP, to a thousand other things before we‚Äôre completely inundated. Many of these peasants will shuffle home to their broken cultures.  God created inflation and national bankruptcy to stop this, which is ultimately what happened in Eastern Europe.

        Zman, don‚Äôt forget the very first revolt in the Soviet Empire: the uprising in Berlin of 1953.

Thousands of brave Germans were murdered, yet they have no memorial. No movie has ever been made about. It was treated as a non-event in the West and deliberately ignored by ‚Äòfree‚Äô governments. Most people today don‚Äôt even know it happened.

Germans cannot be allowed to be seen as victims or heroes ‚Äì especially in Germany.

        The country died morally and culturally decades ago (see the 1970‚Äôs) but not economically.  We live in a dead society that has no future.  The left is just maggots eating the corpse.  Trump‚Äôs chance of failure was 100% even if he was a reformer, which he wasn‚Äôt.  You can‚Äôt re-animate a corpse and just brush off the maggots that have already eaten most of it.  Nature is just a set of fractals and the left is the human fractal of entropy.  When the old, 1930s and 40‚Äôs era cogs of this machine finally fail, that will be the time when reform is even plausible.  The automated kibble dispenser just has to run out of kibble.  Then we‚Äôll just be left staring at each other, and getting hungry.  That‚Äôs when the magic will happen.  It all come‚Äôs down to Say‚Äôs law.  You can‚Äôt have something for nothing.

            Yes, and they are well aware that a sudden and overt gun grab may trigger a grassroots hot civil war. As such, they prefer a longer game in which mass indoctrination attempts to persuade a majority to voluntarily disarm and then uses incremental restrictions and proscriptions on the diehards. Most of Europe was successfully disarmed in this fashion.

            That‚Äôs great NRA sales pitch, but‚Ä¶not necessarily true.The Russian people had weapons. Just no organization.The Russians and the rest had no organization or leadership to defeat the Communists.The White Russians were an infighting train wreck.The Kadets were Holy Fools ‚Äì Frankly our modern White Democrats are very much the Kadets.But the idea that the Russians lacked weapons isn‚Äôt true, the peasants all had guns.  Not to mention the Cossacks.Weapons are not hard to make, and even easier to get if you are willing to fight and you win.  There were multiple foreign armies in Russia until about 1922.The Communists won because they were better disciplined and organized than their opponents. They also in 1917 had a lot of German Gold to spread around, and the Imperial German Army attacked Kerensky‚Äôs troops but spared those who chose Lenin.

        Trump was no red pill.  He was a sleeping pill. It would, however, be fantastic if it was proven in any way, shape or form that a computer algorithm robbed him of votes, even if this isn‚Äôt covered in our Pravda Press.‚ÄúOne obvious failing of the populist movement that put Trump in the White House is it was never able to create a plausible alternative in the mind of the people. Was the goal a return to the past or was the goal the present with specific modifications?‚Äù   ‚ÄìYes.  It was.  And it‚Äôs a loser.  It was boomers who wanted to turn the clock back to 1986‚Ä¶.Forever‚Ä¶.‚ÄúTrump was not skilled enough to grasp this and lacked the imagination to articulate a plausible alternative, even if he recognized the historical moment.‚Äù‚ÄìEven if Trump recognized it he would never have acted upon it because he is NOT a reformer.  He was a guy who promised to be the repair man of a currently broken machine.  He was never about repurposing the machine for other uses once it was up and running.

        It‚Äôs even mentioned in the Declaration of Independence:‚ÄúPrudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.‚ÄùThe amazing thing about the American Revolution, was that the people apparently did NOT choose the strong horse. I wonder if being heavily armed had some fortifying effect on their spirits? And guess what, we are still heavily armed‚Ä¶BTW, one has to question whether the people of eastern Europe really did in fact put up with tyranny. Yes, violent rejections of it were few and all unsuccessful, but there are other means to whittle away support for the regime.Also, on the point about people with nothing left to lose, there are plenty of those in any society, even rich societies. People rebel not only because of poverty, but also because of things like dual-standard justice, or predatory ruling class behavior.

            This is more a philosophical comment. The old saying that there is nothing more dangerous than a man who knows he has nothing to lose, is probably true. What occurred to me:¬† almost as sad is the man who doesn‚Äôt realize what he stands to lose, and plunges headlong with his harebrained ideology. That last statement defines many in our government.

        We analyze and debate endlessly (which essentially functions as mental masturbation) because it‚Äôs easy to do in the internet age, it mollifies anxiety, and it creates a false sense of accomplishment. There won‚Äôt be a tangible alternative response until people are actually starving, living in misery, and have their back up against the wall. If, or when, the House of Cards economy ultimately crashes/burns/begets real hardship, the Elites will manufacture a war to distract the masses. History 101.

        My $.02 on a solution‚Ä¶The current political structure relies on the two party system, and this will not change anytime soon. While taking over a political party is incredibly difficult, the outcome is at least a hand on the stick of state, which is immensely powerful.I suggest readers of this blog (and Zman has suggested this previously) become actively involved in their state‚Äôs Republican Party. Play the game. Support fundraising efforts. Become known as a useful and active participant. Invite other like minded people to do the same.After elections political parties revert to a bare-bones crew packed with party insiders and no one else. This is when you get the most leverage and are able to move things in the direction we think they can go. This is much easier than establishing a new party with a obviously nationalistic bent, especially in these times.

            No. We cannot say both that the government is illegitimate and participate in its elections. We are not voting our way out of this.

                    Italy and France post WWII
Americans sometimes see only the socialism of Italy and France outside of the historical context which was a national group effort to rebuild the countries in exchange for pensions and jobs.  It was not socialism per se but more of a shared sacrifice in exchange for rewards from the state.  They could have just as easily adapted a different rebuilding strategy, I would think.
and now look at them, sucked into the EU vortex

                        One dimension of the socialism vs. national socialism thing has been that under socialism, the upper and lower classes destroy and steal from the middle, by and large, as an opening act.  National socialism often starts as the middle class attacking the top and the bottom, flipping the equation.

        Sold out arms and ammo is the difference between us and them.  The concept of resisting tyranny wasn‚Äôt as widespread there as it is here.  Thought experiments abound on what to do in various scenarios.  Election fraud incarcerations will reduce the threat, but not the vigilance.

        One small quibble with your characterization of life in the old USSR ‚Äì they most certainly did NOT have a low crime rate. According to Anatoly Karlin, who has worked extensively with Soviet statistics, the USSR consistently had a higher murder rate than did the US since 1940, and this is not including the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù murders of Stalin. Of course, none of this was made public at the time. Here‚Äôs a link to some of Karlin‚Äôs research on this, who incidentally is NOT any kind of a Cold Warrior on these issues‚Ä¶

                You could make the argument that organized crime, black markets, and corruption was the only thing that kept the USSR going the last twenty-five or so years of its existence. Makes you wonder if what really brought the system down was Gorby‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnti-Corruption‚Äù campaign.

            To scratch my aviation fetish, I once deigned to parachute across Russia from west to east. Antanovs, Ilyushins, Mils and Sukhois galore.
What I noticed was that my middle class hosts in every Russian city and burg, with money to burn on skydiving and drinks afterward, almost invariably skipped out on paying their bills. They knew where somebody had pried apart the iron fence bars and how to scurry over the tracks and climb up onto the platform to avoid a trivial train fair. Etc.
I *know* the Russians have criminality hardwired into their DNA.

        They seem to have infinite money, total control of all media, and a willingness to cheat, lie, and steal to achieve their goals.  This election fraud gives us a glimpse of the incredible reach that they have.  They seem to have a majority control of the US Intelligence agencies.  If they want you gone, they can make it happen.

                My thoughts on their infinite sums of money were targeted on the stock market.  If they can organize a massive election fraud, in broad daylight, and get away with it, just imagine the manipulation that going on in the stock market.  Computerized trading that responds to every orchestrated market announcement is like printing your own money, while the Chairman of the SEC looks the other way cuz they‚Äôre a member of the tribe too.

            Trump had the perception of being anti-establishment.  Those seeing him as the best opportunity for change, but with stability, voted for him.  Not to go back to what was, but to say screw you to DC.Now it‚Äôs obvious that voting is not the answer that people thought it would be.  TPTB are telling the people, screw you.  They usually wait until they are actually in office to do that.  So, people don‚Äôt know what to do now.I have a clear picture in my mind.  TPTB world-wide have a goal, or an end.  Just look at the pdf of Agenda 2030 and read about the WEF.  We know they work with an end justifies the means mentality.  They will do anything to steamroll the world into submission in ‚Äúequality‚Äù, in a clean, thoughtless paradise, with few personal freedoms or rights.  Destroying a US President that is a thorn in their side is a top priority.People need to be shown the harsh realities of what the future holds.  The Globalist steamroller needs to be held in clear contrast to individual liberties.  If the majority want the steamroller, heading for the hills would only buy us time.

Basically, its this imagined utopian society where you share living spaces based on your schedules and many other crazy, never-will-happen, ideas are cast as marvelous.

        Our system cannot be reformed. This has been obvious to the DR for years but Trump opened a great many of those eyes who were before insensible to the irredeemable nature of the anarcho-tyrannical regime that we are forced to live under. Now we‚Äôre headed down the hard road to revolution.Americans like to think of themselves as rebels willing to ‚Äúwater the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants‚Äù but no, we are subject to the same forces that have shaped other lands and peoples. Thus most people in all times and places will tolerate just about anything to avoid disorder and we are no different. But Trump won‚Äôt be willing to do what is necessary, he just puts on a tough guy front. And Biden is even worse in the weak sister department. Either way, we‚Äôre headed down the hard road to revolution.Be adaptable. As Bruce Lee said (paraphrasing). One second be like water, the next second be like rock.

        I talked to some progressive acquaintances of mine both white and black and one of their greatest pet perves about Trump was his slogan Make America Great Again. The ‚ÄúAgain‚Äù part was what really bothered them.If only Trump would drop the word ‚Äú Again‚Äù after all Obama was not only progressing us he was a black progressive. The idea of wanting to go back to America before Obama was anathema to them.So here we are in 2020 without a defined message for what we want going forward and staring at being subjects of soft totalitarianism. Finding that Solidarity like message is the key to gaining public support and we need public support not just a bunch of circle jerks like the alt right crowd turned into.

                    Not sure about that.
The Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05 could be argued as an early precursor of WWI.
Also, the Japanese sent quite¬†a few troops¬†to help the Russian Whites in 1919:

One would be called into the local police office and told to sign a confession, just a formality, it will never see the light of day.  If you did not sign, you were not longer a doctor, you were a window washer, for the rest of your working life.

        There was a glaring difference between the Eastern European communists and the totalitarian monsters who run the United States.Yes, there were many Reds who wanted to elect a new people, but they were the exceptions and not the rule despite the shibboleths they mouthed about international socialism. Even Stalin, in his homicidal madness, loved the Russias. What we have here and now are people who literally hate and loathe White Americans, Canadians, Australians, Kiwis and Europeans and want them marginalized if not outright exterminated.The captive nations were able to end relatively peacefully. This will not happen here and in Europe because the aim is not just subjugation but elimination. Yes, things will stay calm until the United States has an economic collapse and/or suffers a humiliating military loss.ETA: Of course, everyone knows the election was stolen and no one, especially the State‚Äôs controlled opposition, will act to undo the theft because their bellies are full and bombs are not raining down. This is the interregnum before those things happen and people are not about to do anything to topple the applecart. But the applecart will be toppled.

        Let me add, that Trump won. Biden‚Äôs team just cheated, massively. It was the Establishment doing to Trump what they did to Bernie Sanders.Trump was for the populace, at least most Whites and about half Latinos, the vote for stability. For NOT: constant riots, constant violence by blacks, constant racial hectoring, not being able to buy meat, eggs, or milk, not being able to gas up your car, not being thrown out of work. Trump was for ordinary people all of this which is why he won big. Working and Middle class income went up more in Trump‚Äôs term even with Covid lockdowns than for the past 20 years. Combined. That‚Äôs plenty of stability.But for the Elite, he was chaos. They need/want to debase the populace as they have no other way of feeling good about themselves unless ordinary people are miserable. Trump was stopping the Green New Deal. Stopping Reparations. Stopping Street Reparations.Is any ordinary person better off now, than they were three years ago? Two years ago? One year ago? Is Biden offering Good Times Rolling? Jobs and money and security and more stuff? Nope he‚Äôs offering misery with a moral crusade that appeals to blacks and blacks and blacks y‚Äôall and White Karens and various aggrieved young women of various colors. That‚Äôs it.Look at anti-Fa. All they can recruit are child molesters, domestic abusers, various criminals, and weirdos.

                Respectfully, if Trump is not elected, the media will never let his criticism of Biden see the light of day.  His Twitter will be censored and he‚Äôll fade into the background.  He‚Äôll be painted as a sore loser, eating sour grapes.  History (written by Simon-Schuster) will record him as some cartoonish buffoon ‚Ä¶ more fit for a cage than the Presidency.  His legacy will be tainted so that no one every tries this again. That‚Äôs what our (((rulers))) will do.

        Incidentally, there is a ‚Äústudy‚Äù out saying that working from home makes people more racist.  Believe it‚Äôs from England.But dovetails with something I noted a few months ago.   If you have to work with blacks and so forth everyday, you become ‚Äúprogramed‚Äù to want to take their side on things like BLM.  The mind tends to shut off to anything remotely critical of blacks.  For whatever reason.  And so many white guys are in precisely that position, so getting them to see the light won‚Äôt work if it means it makes daily interactions with colleagues next to impossible.Ah, but once free‚Ä¶.    There is nothing holding them back.

        The Soviets crumbled because they could not pay the border guards in first Hungary (where East Germans were able in late 1988 to cross into Austria) and then East Germany when the wall came down in 1989. And they ran out of money because Reagan crashed oil prices. Reagan‚Äôs team might not have been geniuses but they recognized the weakness of the Soviet System ‚Äî it required economic surplus to keep the enforcers enforcing. Biden of course wants sky-high oil prices while he makes war with Russia in Syria, and with China in the South China Sea, etc.The Diverse are not very cohesive. The Left is already unhappy with Biden and set for confrontation, Team Biden is old, weak, and a senile leader and crackhead/airhead combo for his family.Meanwhile the Biden move will be to appease the left with ever greater anti-White street reparations ala Rick Moranis, a White Tax, a lockdown for Thanksgiving and Christmas, a lockdown extending 18-24 months they are talking while vaccines go to Africa. Even Sailer is alarmed at the wokeness. All while courting war with competent foreign powers. This is why Spencer etc. wanted Biden. They figured accurately that Biden would accelerate things and Trump delay them.Can the US pay Reparations with a White Tax while making 75% of America unemployed and imposing a meat tax and gas tax to make both unaffordable to those working (inflation for food is out of sight) after three years of continuous rising incomes? No. All while Whites personal physical security is ever more threatened with street reparations. And an election that was stolen with everyone knowing it. No legitimacy, inability to pay the military or police around the corner, military defeat fairly certain, rapidly declining living standards and personal safety.

        What happensd in Wayne County is a great case study as to why we always lose and won‚Äôt win. The left is free to threaten, dox, harass and physically attack us. Our side caves at the first sign of resistance. We aren‚Äôt willing to hurt our lives to win. This is why our only rebellion is buying guns. It is the only safe way to rebel because it is no threat to the ruling class.

        I think ppl rebel against weakness not tyranny. Take the case of Russia; there were many partial rebellions and much terror (by ‚Äòprivate initiative‚Äô, not the gov) under the last Czar, Nicholas II. Then the war came and he fell and then he was killed. His police and such were brutal enough but he was always seen as a weak, dithering dilettante. Later, under Stalin, there was to be little in the way of rebellion even though things were much worse in many ways.The same pattern earlier in France. Under Louis XVI, total revolution and poor King Louis lost his head. Under Napoleon, no such nonsense was tolerated even though his everlasting wars put at least equal strain on the population. Maybe it helped that most young men were in his uniform but the pattern, if it is a pattern, still holds; you rebel against a weakling government or leader. It is suicide under a genuine strongman. Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein etc. same thing. Saddam had rebellions but only after military disasters and even weathered them. It took ‚Äòrebels‚Äô, neo-cons, in DC to get rid of him. But how to let loose the deluge of revolution is something we should be looking at. B/c reform from the inside will not happen.

The French liked Napoleon because he was¬†a winner.


His only decisive loss was to the Russian known as General Winter.


Even Wellington admitted he barely won at Waterloo.

                I think you‚Äôre right, Napoleon was genuinely popular and there is much to admire about him although, ironically for an Italian Frenchman, he was a chump w the ladies lol But like a Stalin or Saddam, it is very hard to imagine a Napoleon being caught off guard by a popular rebellion and caving to it. He would not have gone quietly like a Louis XVI or Nicholas II. He would have crushed it like a bug. And maybe that was Trump‚Äôs problem, he was a Captain Hook, ie a cartoon tough guy. In a situation that called for real life tough.

        ‚ÄúThe Boomers care more about their stock portfolios and their kids care more about the game consoles.‚ÄùMaybe that‚Äôs the case in Gringol√°ndia, but it‚Äôs not ubiquitous. I‚Äôm a ‚ÄúBoomer‚Äù, don‚Äôt have a stock portfolio in spite of (or perhaps because of) the fact that I was at one time a succesful equities trader. I moved to productive tangibles long ago and at least up to the present, this strategy has proven itself small-scale effective, which is good enough for me. My younger (now 40) kid has made it so with the business in which we both invested. The game console has been left to the six year old grandson, who has fun with it between his schoolwork and farmlette chores. And his mom isn‚Äôt 100% white! Imagine that!

            And you are going to be unreliable.  Your kid is probably as ‚Äúanti-racist‚Äù as any SJW.  Is his identity wrapped around the x% that isn‚Äôt white?  Because that is what happens with 95% of mixed kids.  Even 1/4 black children of a white end up identifying with the 1/2 black absent father they don‚Äôt even know. The same thing happens with Asian mixes too. This is one of the major reasons race mixing is EVIL.

        They may be petty, but they are not dumb nor are they incompetent.  These people have won every single battle since the guns went silent in 1945. They won around the world. They have gotten everything they wanted.The first and only useful tool we ever had in fighting them has been lost because they took it away from us. It didn‚Äôt just break either. They saw what it could do and they took it from us. We bitched and complained and did NOTHING.At least they can get 100k people to show up somewhere. They can conjure up more drug addicts and criminals to attack us when we try to show up than we can muster good people to do something.True we are more effective online than in person, but we are not 1/10th as effective as we were 6 years ago online.  The so-called alternatives are terrible. At best they are ghettos and at worst they are just as bad as twitter or FB.

        I generally love your posts Z Man.  This time I think you nailed at the beginning and then lost the thread.  I am old enough to remember the cold war, which means I am completely irrelevant in modern America now, and yes we used to mostly despise communism because you had to wait in line to buy ordinary items and‚Ä¶ they oppressed christians.  Now that America has all but abandoned christianity and we are all waiting to get our groceries delivered (at least in the big city where I live), none of the arguments against communism really resonate anymore.  I would love it if, all things being equal, my current daily life remained mostly the same AND the government just gave me free electricity and internet and sent me a check every month to cover my basic expenses.  But we are actually living in a kind of communist state for Black people in that they are getting all of the upward mobility and we are just extra labor.  So here‚Äôs why I disagree with your final paragraphs this time‚Ä¶  We actually do want to play along with this bamboozlement of our culture because we really do want to void the check on the accusation of racism.  In other words, why be the one guy who fighting against the ascension of ‚Äúblack power‚Äù that is rather comically playing out as basically just giving black people an easy lay-up in life.  It‚Äôs like you are watching the special olympics and you are the one guy in the stands who keeps saying ‚Äúthese kids can‚Äôt run fast enough to really win a medal.‚Äù  In other words, just like in the soviet system, we are all playing along.  At a certain point we will get tired of playing along and the bamboozlement game will end.  But right now young black people are loving the fact that they are sticking it to whitey.  So what.  It‚Äôs just a tv show.  Stop watching it and I will bet your life is like mine in that almost nothing has really changed.

        The one book I urge everyone to read (regardless of politics) is ‚ÄúThe Forsaken‚Äùhttps://tinyurl.com/y22zrmnqIt‚Äôs the story of Americans during the Depression seeking a better life working in a Ford Factory in the USSR.

Not really. Stalin‚Äôs inhuman ability to sacrifice bodies for maximum gain cannot be understated; plus it‚Äôs insulting to the Russian people to do so.

                The MiG-29 and Su-27/33/35 are spoken of very highly by Western pilots that have flown them or faced them in exercises.
Russia also leads in hypersonic missiles and integrated air defence systems. The Kalibr cruise missile is also pretty¬†good.
Their GLONASS system¬†is on par¬†with GPS for most use cases.
For a long¬†time, US astronauts required Russian help with travel to and¬†from¬†the ISS.

I suspect those are exaggerated claims made by US-based defense experts who have a vested interest in continuing the arms race. I don‚Äôt doubt Russia has the toys, but I highly doubt they have many of those toys nor can they make many of them. Also, any electronic counters the NSA (yes, they serve a function beyond spying on your porn habit) comes up with to those wonderful missiles will be kept as secret as possible.

            They developed a helmet-mounted cueing system that enabled their jet pilots to take successful off-boresight shots during ACM. Germany united and we got an inside look at the technnology and also flew mock battles against it. Our pilots would have been massacred. We failed to field a comparable system until AIM-9X, which was several decades after the Soviets did.

This said, I am constantly learning from all of you. When I was growing up, the best compliment my family gave to a person was ‚ÄúI can learn from you.‚ÄùHere I learn from you.

            The Soviets did not have crappy military gear, certainly not in 1941 or WW2.  The Germans were horrified when they ran into the T-34, never mind KV-1.  They couldn‚Äôt touch it. They needed 88‚Äôs to knock them down.The Germans invaded with few Pnz IV‚Äôs, mostly Pnz III‚Äôs.They couldn‚Äôt take the T-34s, never mind the KV-1s.What defeated the Russians in 41 was disorganization and poor logistics, along with frankly bad leaders.  Much of this can be laid to the purges, it was very heavy on logistics.The German Panzer Divisions in 1941 had far more trucks than the Russians, who‚Äôs tanks broke down or ran out of fuel and were destroyed by their crews.  By 1944 thanks to Lend Lease the Russians had far better logistics- our most important contribution being trucks.Tactics are for battle, War is Logistics.

        Reference the new directives:  Out here in the middle of the country, many people just don‚Äôt care what the powers dictate.  Perhaps a majority, or most)  I note that in most activities managed by females, masks are more commonly worn.  In those controlled and executed by men (construction, oil and gas, agriculture, manufacturing), masks are hardly ever seen.Go to any medically oriented concern, and be prepared to wear a mask.  Although I‚Äôll admit that out here, even banking, and some female run professional offices I visit pay no homage to the latest control schemes.The school I attend follows the latest mandates and chatters constantly about COVID; in the 100% male program I‚Äôm involved with, no one spends any time worrying about the latest hysteria or mandate.Out here, many are telling them to pound sand and are accepting the risks themselves.

        Isn‚Äôt the problem with the analogy with the Russians and the Czech s that Russians are not Czech s. Theres not way to send in the tanks on ‚Äúthem‚Äù because we are them.

        Zman, do you think Trump is part of a faction ‚Äúat the table‚Äù?  It strikes me that it is a category failure to see the election as one man against many.  So if you think Trump is part of a faction, whom else is in there?
