        I took a quick look at Bluesky and yep, all the crazy escapees seeking asylum from X are there. One comment stands out; this place is like therapy. Of course Don Lemon made his grand entrance there. For him it’s better to rule in hell then serve in heaven.

                Funny but true. Reminds me of my brother telling a story about him and his future wife renting a hall for wedding. Wife was of Ukranian heritage and last name ended in wicz. Rental guy asked her how to spell it correctly for forms. Later her mother stepped in strong arming him on price and as he was writing he asked if she was sure it wasn’t witz referencing an earlier discussion about the difference of jewish designation.

        How does the psychological need to proselytize fit into this? If I start up a BBS to discuss baseball, say, it makes sense that eventually it disaggregates into rival Yankees and Red Sox boards, and then into different groups within those fan bases, as you say. But, crucially, the Red Sox guys are happy, indeed eager, to leave the Yankees guys alone (I know, shitposting is a thing, but in general). I want to say that the “Left” (for rhetorical convenience) simplycan’tdisaggregate. We’d love it if they went off to have their own version of Twitter; hell, we were perfectly happy to let them have theactualTwitter. But they just couldn’t leave it alone, because they can’t leave anything alone. I think this overwhelming compulsion they have to infiltrate and proselytize breaks the analysis down…

            I was going too long, so I did not touch on this, but I suspect a diving force behind the centralizers is the innate desire to impose their morality on the rest. The people driving desegregation, on the other hand, want to be left alone. It is why the crazies escaping to Bluesky tell each other that the invisible of army of Hitler will soon join them. Not only do they need a devil, they need someone to lecture.

It is why eventually, some sooner than others, many if not most will return to Twitter. The pleasantness of their absence will be remembered and tolerance for their usual bullshit will be much thinner than in the past. As I suggested earlier this week, Polymarket (if the Regime does not shutter it beforehand) should take bets on how long it is until, say, The Guardian pops back on to preach to the unwashed, all out of the goodness of its heart.

                    It’s happened once already. There was an exodus of these sorts after Musk bought the platform. They also claimed that Musk’s firings meant that the platform and company would collapse because of all the expertise that he got rid of. They gloated when he brought back a few of them afterwards. As always, this says a lot more about them than it does X.

                        Leftists are deranged. I once dismissed the claim that “liberalism is a mental illness.” How stupid of me.
That’s hilarious and predictable, by the way. Cucks are already preaching unity and forgiveness. Fuck them right along with the wannabe communists.

                        What it says is that censorship is very, very effective.They think the thing they think everybody thinks, and “everybody” is now so constrained—dissenters of all kinds are so thoroughly banned from everywhere—that everything they think is wrong.If you argueon 4chanthat Twitter works about as well as it did before Elon bought it and its financial state is fine or irrelevant, you’re definitely getting dogpiled (onlypartlyby ActBlue botjeets), you’re very likely to have your post deleted, and you’re not unlikely to be banned. The “consensus” of the most right-wing site on the internet is identical to MSNBC—on anything considered important enough to manufacture a consensus about.On Twitter you can say Twitter is doing fine, of course, but what gets you in trouble there? How could you know? Those guys are all banned. They’re not allowed to tell you why—and Elon always pretends he doesn’t know.

                In its geopolitical aspect, the desire for wealth, power and status, perhaps moreso than morality, ideology, religion, has been the stimulus for centralization.  The Mongols had no interest in imposing the worship of Tengri on the Russians; they just wanted their land and resources.

                I wonder if Musk knows that, and is waiting for the temper tantrum to die down before he rolls out a much more robust subscription model. I got a good laugh at Don Lemon’s hilariously overwrought and narcissistic “resignation letter,” like everyone else, but I noted that his official reason is “a change in the terms of service,” re: the adjudication of claims. Once they’re gone, he might go full subscription, and so when all the Leftists come crawling back because there are no Deplorables to lecture on Bluesky, he can say “You pays your money, you takes your chances” re: calls for more censorship. I agree that theywillbe back; as pointed out downthread, a bunch of them have already rage-quit Twitter at least once. Maybe Elon’s taking the opportunity to really scalp them this time.

                Our most basic instincts were formed over 150k plus years. Humans have a visceral fear of heights. The monkey does not. Some humans will overcome fear of heights it if the pay is high enough. Most won’t.Hayek claimed atavistik man was, in modern terms, socialist–a solitary man was a dead man. And, that all advances in civilization were anti-instinctual–like trade through intermediaries. Then the advances stick only when they are too benificial to ignore at which point we imagine they are natural.Socialism (centralization) always returns in spite of disatrous examples because it is instinctive, and instinctive is easy. The ruthless rule by boot on neck, the clever and ruthless rule by exploiting the instinct of normie. It’s become a sopisticated push button enterprise which is, at the moment, over its skis. We’ll see.

            I think this is accurate because the people we are discussing are very effeminate in the negative sense of the word. Not feminine, the negative energy part of being female. Emotional, volatile, child-like, petulant. They will stomp their feet, scream, and just be overly dramatic running away to a safe space. Then, over time, in childlike fashion they will calm and return to the playground. For a while… until the next outrage cycle.I have seen tremendous self-sorting in the last week or so since Trump re-ascended. Liberal ‘friends’ of mine removing themselves from chat groups because they are so childlike in their inability to regulate emotion they cannot handle any contrary opinion or information. These are grown ass men in many cases, and I know a shockingly high amount of them. And the wives are FAR worse which likely explains much.I’ve said this before but I never realized how powerful long term and subtle propaganda is at capturing the midwit and the average mind. I use to be baffled by the Soviet times and the Pravda mindset but no longer. Some of these people I have known for decades and there is almost no part of their former selves remaining. They are SO far to the left and like a swimmer in the ocean who thinks he is simply treading water to remain ‘in place’ this powerful current has carried them far far away from their starting position.

                My husband was mocking an online headline last night – “Trump’s Sec Defense nominee doesn’t believe women belong in combat!!!” it shrieked.  Until people can openly say (and accept in their hearts and minds as true) that men and women and races are different – physically, psychologically, and intellectually – then everything is built on a foundation of lies and NOTHING will change.  You can be a mega magatard on X, but you can’t say only Whites can be Americans.

        I never heard of it.Never had a Twitter account either. But I am a grumpy fat old white guy that hates everyone on general principle. I’m all over Blab for the rude jokes and realistic commentary. Given my politics even the loons there are entertaining and if they’re not I am an adult with a ‘mute’ button.I did a cursory fly-by of Bluesky and immediately recognized it for a faggot/femcnut enclave and left. I don’t think it will survive long or ever be a force in our social space. I note with some cheer that similar lefty social spaces like CNN and MSNBC are going to be laying off and restructuring as these tectonic shifts in politics continues. The rebellion against wokeness has begun. There will be refugees as their old places become rubble.I am okay with them having their own spaces. I’d rather not share mine with them and anything that gets them away from me is a Good Thing…

                That vocabulary! Below, milord is compared favorably to a troll; I say no, that milord is a Jester of astonishing literacy.(Sans the belled cap, a man doth have his pride.)Rather than a key aspect, I say such desire is the arboreal essence of our kind. We had not fearsome fangs nor claws, but instead, each other.As a Prey species, like herbivores, our greatest fantasy is to unite against some awesome Predator.Our fur is smooth that we might dive into the waters of Miocenene swamps to escape, our brachiatial build is that we may climb the tree instead.We are Prey become Predator, the Herd-who-Hunts.Our bull rings protect the core of females and calves, our outlier packs range seeking mating rights. Eventually, the yipping of those outlier packs join into a chorus, loud enough to contest the aging bull ring.As the old bulls are pushed off the hill, the united packs become the new ring, their howls identifying the different generation. The remnants of the old bulls mill about as outlier packs, their children increasingly loud, dreaming someday of reclaiming the glorious past that was theirs.

        A couple of thoughts: Centralization and Decentralization, thus as it ever was:Or as David Byrne would sing: “SAME! AS! IT! EVER! WAS!”. And then slap himself in the forehead.In the disaggregated world, there are those who see a benefit, personally, morally or philosophically in bringing the disparate parts under one roof. At some point in the consolidation process, there are those who begin to see a benefit, personally, morally or philosophically in breaking the blob into pieces or creating alternative pieces to the blob.Speaking of business, as in, we make real, tangible things here for our customers, in light of the Scandemic breaking “Just in Time” supply chains will we see a return to Vertical Integration in manufacturing? I think of Henry Ford’s River Rouge plant when it opened, where Ford mined the ore, smelted the steel and iron, and aimed to control everything it took to make a Model A and later cars from bumper to bumper, tire to roof.I know, I should post something on the centralization/decentralization of the internet. All I can think of is Facebook is a huge “thing” that when you ask people about it, apparently no one “goes there” anymore. Cue Yogi Berra, eh?

                There’s a pretty good video on YouTube from the late 1930’s of the River Rouge plant that follows the process of building Fords from the ore carriers docking by the plant all the way to the cars rolling completed off the line:

Ford tried to make everything but the tires, and he tried (and failed) to grow rubber trees in a Ford owned plantation in Brazil.

        Why does this dynamic exist? Because it works, in the evolutionary sense. Whenever an assembly of human beings gets gets comfortable and stale as a result of high societal efficiency (borne of centralized productivity), that affluence leads to a decline in robustness due to the absence of hardship and culling. This decline eventually leads to a fracturing into weak and strong communities, with the latter prevailing. Business cycle.

                Yep, but even in those days with those types, we saw all/most of the problems we see today with personal—but anonymous—interaction between individuals. I still remember my first encounter with a troll, who read the exchanges unceasingly looking for posters to bully and insult. The topic of discussion was irrelevant for him, only that an aggressive insulting comment could be interjected. Got me memorialized by the Electronic Freedom Foundation who always took an unwavering stance supporting such folk and unlimited (disruptive) commentary. Last I looked, I was on their list of “bad people”. It was badge of honor.

                    Trolls are a thousand times better than true believers.  Trolls just want to have fun.  Like you said, the topic is absolutely irrelevant to the Troll.  They are not emotionally committed.
Today, the term Troll is completely abused.  A Troll is now anyone who disagrees with you.

                        I agree.  My definition of “troll” might not be everyone else’s.  In this case, he was not amusing.  Ostei is amusing and fun to read—but he is no troll.  This person was disruptive to any flow of exchange, and deliberately so.  He’d stop the flow of meaningful exchange, hurt feelings, shut people up, then move on.

                        I have to nominate myself as a longstanding troll, in the true sense. I enjoy hijacking and riling up threads on Twitter for the sole purpose of making people irate. I never get worked up over the matter.Here is why you should pay the troll’s toll: A troll is your chance, if you think, to recognize that all online is fake and g@y, and the troll relishes in exploiting this incongruity to cause amusement for those who understand and anger in those who are too vested in the beast.So sayeth the Troll.

                                        Trolling, when done well, is hilarious to everyone except the people being trolled (who usually don’t even know they are being trolled).The thing is, it’s not easy to do trolling well so they just come off as asshats, their trolling clumsy and obvious and so they are just ignored.

                            Ditto here, at least back in the old days. I looked at it as the perfect vehicle to get the instinct to get a rise out of people out of my system. That way, I can be nice and normal in real life. 😁
Since I host the page I run, I try to play it relatively even handed, though what I really think does come out. The funny thing is when people try to troll me and I just laugh at them. You can’t troll a troll.

            The great thing about usenet was that the sissies couldn’t ban you when you made a fool of them. No way to get rid of wrong-think either.
When I was on Earthlink, which was up until about 2017, they were still carrying usenet and the binary groups.  I got tons and tons of music, movies and books from them.  But my phone company forced fiber optic to my house and DSL is incompatible with it.

                It’s amazing how much those things cost for what they did. Then again, the companies that made them knew they were selling to businesses and not consumers so the customer had infinity monies. There’s a YouTube channel that has a video showing what a quarter million dollar SGI was like in 1993 –https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo3lUw9GUJA. I had a job in the late 90s where one of the machines I used was a low-end SGI with 8-bit graphics. It would use that stippling technique to represent shadows and colors outside the palette. Everything looked sore of like color comics in the newspaper under a magnifying glass.

        We see something similar wrt a new phenomenon, the “independent researcher” in HBD science, specifically wrt genetic explanations of IQ and behavioral attributes.  The University research system no longer allows such explorations among faculty and the number of journals that will touch/review such papers—much less publish them—are vanishingly small and cannot keep up with demand and time constraints of journal publication as the field expands.Most of my readings are via direct subscription to these researchers.  Some charge for such subscription, some do not.  The difference between what I receive via the quarterly journal subscription route and now is simply one of cost and frequency of publication.  When at university, I had no cost for journals, but was locked into their selection—and therefore research topic choices.I think it’s better now.

            I saw a article that said Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine’s infamous father, was the one responsible for installing the peer review system and its awfulness.
Apparently he bought up and published the professional journals with the intent of consolidating them under his wretched grip, just as he bought up the high-school textbook publishers that gave us our faux history.
Following that, one of the Covid doctors says it is PubMed that monitors and suppresses the necessary and contrarian studies in the medical field.

                The school textbook market k-12, and university is the largest segment of publication industry.  It exceeds everything else combined…fiction, nonfiction, health, exercise, how-to, etc. everything!  That’s one of the reasons why the publisher’s are such whores to local and State school boards and are happy to  adjust their publication content accordingly.

            Aggregation via apparent disaggregation would be ideal from the oligarchs’ perspective. Resistance would become incomprehensible. It would always be understood as resistance to something definitionally different, towhatever. Like to “Our Democracy.”If I were them I’d propagandize differently, maybe with an absurd, self-contradictory, literally unthinkable concept like “counter-elite.” People whothinkthey think that will follow any order. Hell, they’ll continuallyanticipate, in every sense, their submission.Maybe I’d put on a great show—the greatest, they tell me!—post the great mythicalproof.mov. It’s not like there’s a budget limit, and if it works, maybe it works forever.Any of ourHegel guysbeen noticing anything like that happening? Do we still have Hegel guys?

The Chinese just accepted the aggregation/disaggregation cycle as a natural tide go in / tide go out aspect of the human condition and indeed the wider universe.

        I glance at X occasionally but find it mostly thin gruel. For me, social media is a way to share family pics and news with my widely scattered siblings and their offspring (refugees from California) and get some laughs from memes and organizations that interest me (e.g., army veterans). I mostly ignore any political stuff, esp. from my relatives who are mostly Christian Zionist nutjobs. It’s a pity, because they are otherwise nice people.

        Yep. Most of the time the natural instinct of humans is to protect themselves against change. Only after disaster strikes is there an opportunity to build without fighting the regulators and the NIMBYs. E.g., Germany and Japan after WWII.

        O/T, but tangential, listening to some techno-pop on Pandora this morning, a voice-over played above the drum machines and synthesizers:“There’s messages in every game. Like Pac-Man. Do you know what “Pac” stands for? P-A-C: program and control. He’s Program and Control Man. The whole thing’s a metaphor. He thinks he’s got free will, but really he’s trapped in a maze, in a system. All he can do is consume, he’s pursued by demons that are probably just in his own head and even if he does manage to escape by slipping out one side of the maze, what happens? He comes right back in the other side. People think it’s a happy game. It’s not a happy game, it’s a f**king nightmare world and the worst thing is, it’s real and we live in it. It’s all code. If you listen closely, you can hear the numbers. There’s a cosmic flowchart that dictates where you can and where you can’t go. I’ve given you the knowledge. I’ve set you free. Do you understand?”

        “Lincoln’s call for volunteers to suppress the ‘rebellion’ of the Cotton States caused the secession of the Upper South. The Cotton States felt that the federal government violated their agreement, and the Upper South believed that they had every right to leave, even if the Upper South disagreed with their reasons for leaving. As R. L. Dabney explained, ‘However wrongfully any State might resume its Independence without just cause, the only remedy was conciliation, and not force, that therefore the coercion of a sovereign State was unlawful, mischievous, and must be resisted. There Virginia took her stand.’”https://identitydixie.com/2024/11/14/part-1-causes-of-southern-secession-in-the-upper-south/As Jeb Smith explains in the article, many in the North were sympathetic to Southern secession until it became clear that the removal of the revenue generated from the excise taxes imposed on the South would strip the Northern government of much of its revenue.The four upper South states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas joined the Cotton states motivated primarily by the rights of sovereign states in the original compact, not slavery.They were also bound by ties of heritage and a common culture, it goes without saying.Fortunately slavery is no longer an issue so advantage “right.”  I think the permanent lesson we learned from that catastrophe is that any secession today (except perhaps within individual states) would compound the harm, by leaving us without any representation in Congress, thus leaving us at the mercies of the fanatics who would remain (Not that that’s a real threat any longer.) We have no choice but to fight to gain control of the U.S. government and reform it from within however unrewarding that may sometimes appear. Right now we have gained temporary dominance but there is a long battle of perhaps decades ahead. If kinetic war ever did breaks out again it would be a true civil war, not a war between sections of the country.The Old South was naive to leave their seats in Congress unoccupied thus ceding control of the US government to the North. We’re all in this together now in the fight against radical egalitarianism and open borders.

            I noticed earlier I got some downvotes but now it’s back to even.  I have gone over what I wrote and the only thing I would change is in second paragraph from bottom I would substitute “resurgence” for “dominance.” It’s hard to know what I wrote that was so offensive when no one actually criticizes my comment. I suspect it’s because I wrote that the Old South was “naive” to leave their seats in Congress. But if you can’t critique your own mistakes then you can’t make any improvement in your game. I could have used a different word: arrogance.

            “If kinetic war ever did breaks out again it would be a true civil war, not a war between sections of the country.”The war stops when the war stops.  The CW war was between two sides, one wanted to leave, the other did not want that.  If the South had battled the North to a potential Northern loss territorially (and it did kill twice as many Northerners), or even a prolonged boring stalemate, and the North said enough, let’s talk.  Why would it not have stopped with some compromise and a de facto two country partition?Similarly, a new CW might have the same dynamics.  Both sides will tire enough to come to some compromise.  Fighting to the death seems not in the cards.  For a modern example, see Ukraine.  I doubt Russia is going to continue to spend more resources taking over the non-Russian parts of Ukraine unless forced to.  Similarly, a modern CW need not be a death match—one or the other.  Both sides “might” exhaust themselves and settle.  It is an imbalance between the two that will cause extended conflict when/if one side feels it will prevail at an acceptable cost.

        A terrific analysis! I’ve witnessed a lot of the events. When I first worked in DC in the 1980s, PCs and then BBSs were just getting started. Most federal departments had at least one PC enthusiast who set up a BBS with all the department’s information. If you had the BBS phone number and were a reporter (as I was) or a spy, you could discover a lot. Online interactions were also a lot more civilized; we might try going back to some form of that:

        I run a group on Facebook for a niche hobby, 28,000 members, which ain’t bad for a niche. We have the most or second most members of the couple dozen groups and pages in that genre. I have no idea how engaged those 28,000 are or what that means, but it’s far more than I ever expected when I started the page.I started my group for the same reason I get amused by all the downvotes I often get when I post something here. I got tired of having my posts censored, deleted and getting kicked off of boards. I figured, if nothing else, I’d have my own soapbox and nobody will tell me what I can and can’t post.Turns out, a lot of like minds appreciate the same thing and congregate together. More people appreciate a little edge than pablum dictated by snowflakes. We have a lot less argument there than many other groups/pages, as well.

            The problem I found with FB before I left was that any particular group I was in exceeded 40-50k easily and as such, impossible to read all postings/commentary and there were a lot—not unusual to find 1.6k comments or more.  Most postings/comments however were of the “me too” type and added nothing very informative to the discussion.
I soon unsubscribed to FB and found I was better off in smaller venues where there was more back and forth commentary from a smaller, but perhaps more focused group.

                If you skim through that sentence, it may seem like a word salad, but upon reading it more carefully, it makes perfect sense.  Things like Harris’ actual word salads are crude pantomimes of sentences like Z’s that the stupid employ.

        Although societies break apart and splinter from one another, there is always a centrifugal force whipping them together. People are nosy and curious. Mega-cities form as entertainment hubs develop. The urge to have fun defeats the urge to be left alone. Even in the South, a region known for its spread-out isolationism, there are mega-cities like Atlanta and Houston to cater to decadent cosmopolitan tastes. Expect to see smaller towns in the South empty out as the metropolises swell in size. In the end, as much as they hate to admit it, people like people, and will pay top dollar to live in desirable places like Greenwich village, New York; San Francisco; and Austin, Texas. These places are the glue in a crumbly society.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            They may be the “glue” that drive civilization, but they’re also it’s ultimate doom.
Most succinct explanation is Spandrell’s concept of cities being “IQ shredders.”
A more ancient account would be the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel.
“Rural” today doesn’t really mean farming anyway.  You can enjoy 90% of the amusements living in the countryside as you can behind your home’s iron barred windows in Houston or Atlanta.

            “The urge to have fun defeats the urge to be left alone”.”people like people”.As a fellow grumpy old man (hat tip to Filthie), I can say with confidence that those two statements apply to young, and inexperienced people.One of my adult daughters moved into the city in 2010. She had a beautiful apartment, worked a block from her home. All was good, until it wasn’t. We laugh about it now, as she says “what was I thinking”.The truth is, she didn’t know any better. As for hubs that cater to “decadent cosmopolitan tastes”, well, I think that says it all.Oh, and I hate people. My pecking order isThe kidsThe dogsMy Wife(she gets it)The rest of the livestock

                Bartleby:  I’ve been fortunate enough to visit many beautiful (and not so beautiful) cities around the world.  And I’m grateful I was able to do so while -even though they weren’t all at their prime – they were still far more organic and innate than they are today.  There are still places I wish I could have seen but will now never do so (having to fly, immivaders, etc.).  But far more than people, I now value natural beauty and quieter places.Crowds and public spaces are not safe for White people.  And people are vastly overrated.

                        I’veread that there are, unfortunately, plenty of rapefugees up in Scotland now (none when I was there in the ’80s).  But I found the people hearty and friendly, and old Edinburgh and the royal Mile is magical.  I clambered up Arthur’s Seat (an extinct volcano) one sunny afternoon with a book and some snacks and just read and thought and imagined.  A favourite memory.

OK then well, I guess it’s true I am Your Favorite Martian.  I avoid those type places like leprosy.  A buddy or two generally is all I can tolerate re: humanity.

                I visited NY city twice – and I absolutely hated it.  The people, the noise, the filth.    Visited San Francisco briefly on the way back from Asia and was not impressed.  Vienna was a gem 35 years ago.  Same with Budapest and Prague.  Loved the history in London but not the people it was filling with.  Loved Edinburgh.  Wish I could have seen Copenhagen.  Hong Kong was a nightmare.  I’d like to see Alaska but you couldn’t drag me onto a cruise ship.  I’m content in the woods and the hills.

                    Alas, the “crowds” ain’t quite what they used to be in NYC back in the 60s. But I get what you’re saying. When you’re in a good crowd where there’s a sense of ease and shared goodwill, it can be an invigorating even exhilarating experience, particularly in chilly weather. I’m afraid such experiences are now almost nonexistent in AINO, unfortunately.

                        Of course. I go and look over the old neighborhood, hit the mass transport to the museums, Times Square and such. When I’ve had my fill of crowds and ambiance, leave like a good tourist. I was there shortly after 9/11 last. Visited the Trade Tower cleanup.
Aside from the interesting mass transport electronic tolls, little had changed for me. In the daytime, there are still White people around. At night, one is careful where one walks.

                I was blessed when younger to live four years in a major Italian city, and several months each in a couple of scenic smaller cities, before the barbarian invasion.  For work and family reasons I got to spend some time in other European and Middle Eastern cities.  Got to live in Austin and Los Angeles, too. I love big cities that are both organic and authentically native. For example a McDonald’s in Rome or Paris is disgusting as are cosmopolitans in Austin that think themselves better than the local country people and scorn the local accent. Roma autentica, Paris vraie, and authentically Texan Austin are great places to visit and live.All told I prefer the countryside, especially now that I have a much lower income. I can build a fence, cut firewood, plant an orchard and go to church alongside folks with a fortune or next to nothing. They may think it’s interesting that I speak other languages or rubbed shoulders with famous names, but what matters is that I take care of business and treat people decently.  I feel the same about them— they are my peopleI will probably never get back to my old places, so I do my best where I am and hope for the best for those other places and peoples I love and admire.I’m pretty fond of ZMan and you commenters, too!   That’s my take today on Centralization/decentralization. Keep up commenting- I look forward to them every day.  Now, back to turning the compost pile
