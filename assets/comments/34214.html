        At this point, the purpose of every advertisement, television show, documentary and movie is fourfold:Reward non-White client groups with fiscal and psychological well beingTell Whites that they are conquered and that they no longer have a futureQuell the disquiet Whites feel about what is happening to them, but who in their ignorance can’t figure out what it is. In virtual reality, the world is even better when you are being replaced, so replace the unease with a cope and a delusion that it is all going to be smiles and rainbows.Combine  points 1-3 to further humiliate and demoralize Whites, worsening their spiritual health and increasing their propensity to acquiesce to their destruction.The genre doesn’t matter. Making money doesn’t matter. The people who surrounded the great ice cream cone licker and bought his auto pen want you gone. They gave him his slogan: “Finish The Job” All of their propaganda, iconoclasm and iconography is toward that aim.

                You must do the helluva lot of barking.
The only film genre I’m watching these days is the Western, in no small measure because it is blissfully free of Hutus on horseback–Woody Strode being the odd counterexample. Of course, this rules out more contemporary examples, virtually everything since, say, 3:10 to Yuma (2007). This Memorial Day weekend I took in the trifecta of High Noon (1952), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Red River (1948). Mos’ satisfyin’. Call it the bearable whiteness of being.

                    Yes!  2007’s 3:10 to Yuma is the best remake of a Western ever IMO.
//Spoiler Alert//
I liked the more realistic downer ending vs the upbeat ending in the original, though it was great seeing Glenn Ford as a bad guy.
Ever watch the Spaghetti Western trifecta?  Most folks like TGTBATU best but I always preferred For a Few Dollars More. A little less cheeky and much more violent. The character Indio from FAFDM is one of the most underrated bad guys in the Western genre IMO.  What a nasty, evil SOB he is.

                            I think the vast majority of Euro actors at that time–second half of the sixties–were commies.

For a Few Dollars More may be my favorite Western of ’em all. Gian Maria Volante’s Indio is a reptillian villain. And if you don’t love Lee van Cleef, you should be sent to a camp.

The newer version of 3:10 to Yuma works so well because of a young Ben Foster’s awesome performance as Charlie Prince, the sadistic second in command of Ben Wade’s gang who easily slides into the top slot to try and prevent Wade from seeing a long stint in prison.

                I do the same thing. Sadly, my wife likes those miniseries “set” in Bourbon France, Tudor England, Habsburg Spain, and such like, Of course blacks and homos everywhere. When she settles on one of these, I “put on my walkin’ shoes”. I used to tell her, hey, as long as you know that what you are watching isnot history, have at it. But then it started pissing her off, so now I just make myself scarce, sans comment.

            Yep. It’s not just girl bosses and it’s not just science fiction. Every single television show, drama, movie or advertisement features women and Negroes in positions of power and authority over stupid white men. It’s insufferable. I don’t deliberately watch any of it but I see it peripherally and in passing, and it’s such obviously unrealistic propaganda it practically makes me scream.I was sick of this shit decades ago. Back in the 1990s my wife dragged me to the theater to see some Tom Hanks film about a holy Negro on death row breathing magic green goo on everyone. It was utterly ridiculous.I’ve only been to the theater twice in the past 20 years. I sawGran Torino, and then the Clint Eastwood movie about the fat moron who was framed by the FBI for the 1996 Atlanta bombing.(The movies were OK but the theater experience sucked, I hated the crowd, the parking and the endless previews and huckstering before the movies actually started).

                        Josey Wales was muh favorite movie, until very recently, when I learned that Sandra Locke got pregnant just before the movie started filming, at which point she opted to have an abortion.
Now I can’t even enjoy Josey Wales anymore.
Hopefully we’ll always have “Patton”.

                            I never thought much of her, she’s not beautiful and she’s not a great actress. I don’t know what Clint saw in her but pussy does strange things to otherwise intelligent men.I heard something about the abortion, but I don’t really follow these celebrities much. It’s very disappointing.Clint was a Hollywood Republican, and people tend to forget that rich, liberal Republicans were really the ones behind abortion in the 1960s and 1970s. Ronald Reagan and Nelson Rockefeller signed abortion into law in California and New York beforeRoe v. Wadewas decided in 1973. Harry Blackmun, a Minnesota Republican and Nixon appointee, wrote the decision. Goldwater was pro-choice and pro-fag. The Bushes were big Planned Parenthood supporters.I like most of Clint’s movies, but I don’t idolize actors and actresses, I think that’s stupid. They’re all narcissists on some level.

                                My understanding is that Clint is a libertarian. Also an atheist. But he doesn’t seem to be an anti-white racist, and he models white masculinity, so he’s worthy of respect in my book.

                I was a big fan of LOTR,Peter Jackson version, because I loved all the books.  I went to The Hobbit (2012), got my usual popcorn and Diet Coke.  The whole thing including ticket cost about $35, which I thought was a lot at the time.  Only to sit and watch the movie feeling absolutely betrayed and horrified by what was done.  I vowed while sitting there that I would never go to another  movie at the theater.  I’ve only broken that vow once.  Went to Ford vs. Ferrari because I’m a big Christian Bale fan, and my brother wanted to go.  I thought it was good.  Didn’t get any snacks though, because I didn’t want to bend too far.Of course, I would never even consider the dreck that they offer us now.  It’s hard to even watch the reviews by the youtube bloggers, which are overwhelmingly negative, because just watching clips is so disgusting.  ZMAN is right.  The girl boss phenomena is anti-human.

                        He turned the first one into … a musical?  I realize the books are loaded with poems and songs, but it’s understood that you skip over those.
The Hobbit was and is an abomination.  Someday, perhaps already, someone will splice all three films into a 4-4.5 hr single edit.  There is one reasonably solid movie in that 9 hrs of film.  Making it into three movies was nothing less than a shameless cash grab.

                    Lettie: “ZMAN is right. The girl boss phenomena is anti-human.“
The Lady MacBeth Syndrome.
The Black Widow who is hellbent on wearing the pants in the fambly.


If left to its own devices, the Lady MacBeth Syndrome is fully capable of obliterating the entirety of Western Civilization.
Setting aside the V@xxpocalypse and the possiblity of Thermonukular War, nothing else worries me quite like the cold heartless unflinching march ofLady MacBeth through the various institutions of the land.

                Every single television show, drama, movie or advertisement features women and Negroes in positions of power and authority over white men.Blade Runner 2049does something rather interesting with that. As a replicant, Ryan Gosling’s “Officer K” character is faster and stronger and tougher (and apparently smarter) than normal humans, so to keep him subservient to his girlboss superior in the LAPD, he has to undergo daily psychological conditioning, lest he become rebellious over the fact of his innate superiority to those who would exploit his abilities for their own ends. The plight of the modern white man in a nutshell…

Maybe I’ve been watching a little too much Boston Dynamics, Luckey Palmer, and X.AI vids, but this is starting scare the bejeezus out of yours truly.
Gaming streamer Asmongold has an update: video AI has jumped to the point where it is indistinguishable from film. He has a short clip titled, “It’s all over,” and declares that in two years, nothing we see onscreen will be real.

            The first Terminator was a fun movie but all time travel stories suffer from the paradox of time travel. They got around it in the first film by making the time travel essential to the future, but logically there was no real conflict. If future John Connor is the product of Kyle and his mother, then logically the Terminator must fail in his mission. He must always fail.

                The first Terminator is a bootstrap paradox.  If Skynet didn’t try to kill Sarah Connor using time travel, John Connor would never exist and neither would Skynet.  Terminator 2 adds further paradox since they have seemingly prevented Skynet’s development which makes John Connor’s existence non-causal.
All subsequent Terminator films went completely mindless on time travel consistency.  Time travel is more of a logical conundrum than a science fiction.

            How is AI “onscreen” less real than Hollywood “onscreen” real? And I would argue that AI “onscreen” benefits innocents who are raped and abused to get their bodies “onscreen”. I am already at the point I do not believe ANYTHING the mass media puts “onscreen”. How many Joe Bidens? Was the Trump “onscreen” with Rogan somehow a foot shorter than the Trump we see elsewhere? Reality is what I can touch and feel.

        Time travel may be a “MacGuffin” but 1960’s “The Time Machine”(H.G. Wells)is one of my favorite Sci-fi films of all time.  The portrayal of the “Eloi” and the “Morlocks” was truly inspired. Also must mention “Forbidden Planet”, a good film for its day.

            The film wasn’t bad but I’d rate the original short story as one of the greatest of all time. We had to read it in high school and it’s haunted me ever since, especially as it takes place in the part of England where I grew up.

            Heartily concur with “Forbidden Planet”! Sa it at the theatre when I was ten, never forgot it. The special effects were astonishing for 1956, the “monster from the id” was a fascinating concept for a ten year old, the “monster” itself was quite the sight to see when it “appeared” while attacking the electronic security fence… I rate it as equal to either of the two “big boys” and it was the first science fiction movie I recommended to my two grandsons. As soon as the granddaughter (now seven) is old enough, she will find herself watching it with Grandpa explaining things young children don’t quite “get: yet.

            Forbidden Planet gets increasingly strange as its futuristic parts age. The music and visuals are more foreign now than they were then. And it’s quaintly wise.Nobody today has Shakespearean (or even Freudian) ideas about technology’s effects on people. We’re not that smart—the “tech bros” especially not.
A remake where the girl is a bitch and her father rapes her has been threatened for decades. Fortunately James Cameron will die before he can inflict it on us. And the title has no “resonance” with the market anymore, so it might never be defiled.

                    The treatment of Frankenstein in the HBO series “Penny Dreadful” was superb. Goofy premise, but very well executed.
As I recall, the only POCs in the show were an African explorer’s man-servant and a stoic Injun.  Not bad by modern PC standards.

            I often wonder whySpaceballsworked butRobin Hood: Men in Tightsdid not. They are basically the same madcap Jewish-humor spoof film, but Spaceballs feels more fun and improvisational. Sometime afterThe Naked Gun, slapstick got really cringey. Now slapstick is only consumed by black people.

        “Star Wars” is consciously melodramatic and formulaic. It could just as easily be set in the Middle Ages or the Old West, but he chose to set the story in space.I’ve related before that nearly 25 years ago I went to an exhibit at the Field Museum in Chicago based on the first threeStar Warsmovies. I took a gal that I was dating at the time with me.While it was cool to see the costumes and the models they used in filming, what was also interesting was written and visual commentary from the museum curators. In that commentary they pointed out how much ofStar Warsdrew from classic mythology stretching back to the beginning of recorded time:The young hero chosen for a great questThe priest, mystic, or wizard who identifies, trains, and guides himThe hero gathers to him a group to aid him in his questThe hero/group trains to face a great evil / complete their questThe hero may have to face and fight other dangers on their questThe hero must fight and defeat the great evilThey gave examples from all humanity of tales, fables, and myths that supported the central thesis.What was different aboutStar Warswas it showed technology and fantasy wasn’t clean, neat, and spotless. The Millennium Falcon and other spaceships were dirty, dented, and faded. Luke lived on a desert planet and Mos Eisley was a dusty, worn out place that would’ve fit in a Western movie.

            I have always said Star Wars was a dumbed-down Dune, and then we got a dumbed-down Dune, complete with the girlboss.
The visuals almost redeemed both, though. Almost.
btw, if you want a really good, lesser known film, Sunshine.

                Yes! R2D2 and C3PO are modeled after the fools who attend to the great Toshiro Mifune’s character in The Hidden Fortress. Kurosawa did indeed successfully sue Sergio Leone for ripping off Yojimbo and turning it into Fistfull of Dollars.

        I thought the “The Expanse” was a really great sci-fi series.
One of the few where diversity actually made sense and worked quite well. There were three main groups of humans; those who have to deal with a failing earth, those who have colonized Mars and see “earthers” as a potential enemy and a third group who have adapted to their low gravity working environment in the outer ring.
No transporters, no warp drives, no blasters and no weird super-human aliens trying to kill everyone.
Just a decent script, some pretty good acting and an engaging story.

                Technically, it was an ancient biological weapon, not an alien life form.
“The Protomolecule was sent by an alien civilization inside an interstellar asteroïd 2 billion years ago. This asteroïd was captured by Saturn’s gravity to become one of its many moons we called Phoebe. Yet its intended destination was Earth. It is initially seen as a weapon since infected humans die.”

        I guess it comes down to whether you think sci-fi should be depressing, or not.2001, Blade Runner, Gattaca, The Children of Men, are. All moody and plodding. Art house stuff.I have topreparemyself to see a film like Blade Runner.At the risk of sounding like a normie, though, Schwarzenegger IMO was the best sci-fi actor of all time, and perhaps was in the best sci-fi films of all time. Terminator II, Predator, The Running Man, Total Recall. All fantastic and re-watchable. Definitely not art house, but serious enough and not total brain-dead crap like you see out of JJ Abrams.

        Took me three attempts to get through 2001 without falling asleep.  Only film to do that so I guess that makes it great.  Bladerunner is tops for scifi IMO.  Agree on Star wars/trek.  Aliens will be monsters so Alien qualifies.  Asimov is over-rated and the genre would lose nothing had he never been born.

                Well ya gotta remember that you guys are looking at him from 2025. I was buying his novels as he wrote them as a kid and the greats were all still alive and writing.
By today’s standards he must look really lame I suppose? Sometimes I read Vox Day and of his heroic battles with his fellow sci-fi and fantasy geeks…and it boggles the mind to think Asimov is not the worst of the lot… not by a long shot!😂👍
I don’t think you could even sell real sci-fi in today’s market. It would go over everyone’s head…

                Women enjoying a movie disqualifies it as science fiction. They don’t even like the romantic ones like Blade Runner and Solaris.

                        The sequel film2010was actually pretty well done and worth watching. Roy Scheider, John Lithgow, and Richard Dreyfus all give good performances. It also plays on a solid sense of Cold War paranoia from the early/mid-80s.

                I know we’re supposed to roll our eyes at Starship Troopers, but “S.T.” was the last j00vie I ever saw with beautiful young White women wanting desperately to get “it” on with handsome young White men.[Caveat: I haven’t been in a j00vie theater in 15 years, so I have no idea what j00vies are like these days.]Starship Troopers was also the only j00vie I ever saw which gave me the feeling that, “Uh-oh, we might ackshually LOSE this war!!!!!”There’s something about the omnipresent threat of absolute extinction of the species which necessarily heightens the sense of a primordially existential eroticism.It probably also has something to do with why so many women so very much enjoy watching prize fighters beating one another to death in the boxing ring.

                        This is precisely what we’re fighting for…
We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children, because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the Earth.
Necessarily Eroticism [to be followed by natural vaginal childbirth] must be at the very heart of Sci Fi.





In the absence of Eroticism, Sci-Fi doesn’t even rise to the level of sheer purposeless nihilism.

                            Young Dina Meyer was quite the looker, even when they tried to dirty her up inJohnny Mnemonic. She was not quite an, “it girl,” of the mid to late-90s, much like Julianna Hatfield was in music.

                                The bizarre thing about Dina Meyer is that [apparently] she’s a full-bl00ded j00ess.
She’s gotta be amongst the very least j00ey-looking j00esses I’ve ever seen make a living as an actress.
She looks exactly like a ditzy SoCal surfboarding bish.
I wonder if she underwent massive plastic surgery so that she could pass as a shiksa?
And she certainly doesn’t have D-Cup khazarian milkers.
Very very weird.
I wonder is she’s ackshually a shiksa who faked her way through an Hollyweird career, pretending to be a j00ess?

                    It’s not really a satire in any meaningful sense. Verhoeven seemed to think that putting attractive blond men and women onscreen in vaguelyWehrmacht-esque uniforms made the film satirical, but it fails on that count because he never bothered to establish that there’s anything sinister or malignant about the Federation (unless one assumes that happy healthy white people are sinister and threatening, I guess).

        Speaking of little girls beating up big men, in one of his novels, Robert Parker has his hero decking a Karate girl after she kicks him in the balls. She’s puzzled. She says that that should have ended it. He replied that it had happened to him before and knew that he would get over it. She gave him some feminist nonsense, but he replied that in the end, a good big person will always beat a good small person.

            One of the reasons I have a main character, demi-human Faustina Hartmann, say “I’m a twenty-year-old girl.  I can out think any of you, but a sixteen-year-old recruit can drop me in a second.”  So, there’s the fiction of demi-humans, but also the science that the notion of a grrl boss is seriously stupid shit.

                    The percentage of women who have the quantitative ability to do science at a high level is vanishingly small. Now in verbal ability, on the other hand, the dames may actually have a slight advantage over us, but mainly on average. Most people who have extraordinarily high verbal ability are men.

        ‘The demand that the main character be a girl boss who never has to struggle to get what she wants and is never allowed to fail defeats the whole purpose of the genre’However, the girlboss requirement is true to real life. What is portrayed in ‘Snow White’ and ‘Barbie’ is precisely what transpired in America and her satellite nations.Females took over, by vast preference and empowerment. Meaning they’re weaponized for destruction, because largely incompetent due to that lifelong entitlement.As for Heinlein, ‘Stranger in a Strange Land’ was, like ‘Lord of the Rings’, an underground legend in U.S. colleges of the early Sixties. ‘Stranger’ was highly influential concerning the Sexual Revolution and revolutionary cultural changes. Basically, what your country is now.Heinlein’s presentation of Michael smacks heavily of Gnosticism and Thelema, and not surprisingly ole Open Marriage Bob was buds with Rocket Jeck Parsons and L. Ron ‘Mother’ Hubbard.Yeah Bob did a lot of damage the shithead.

        Both Star Wars and Star Trek emerged as America was killing the Western as a genre. So they are adaptions of the Western into space. Star Trek is what’s called a “wagon train” story. Star Wars has all the set design of a Western.

            I have always compared the original Star Trek to a pirate movie. The story is about the three men at the center of it and their adventures are how we learn about them and their relationship. Star Trek actually tried to be decent science fiction in the original, but they have limited resources and the studios wanted safe predictable content.
Subsequent iterations of the franchise are corporate office in space, remote branch office in space and human resources in space.

                The original Star Trek was the work of Lucille Ball, who, together with her husband, Desi Arnaz, created the Desilu production company.
Lucille Ball was one of the great unsung heroines of the 20th Century.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desilu
We in the 21st Century sure could use an whole helluva lot moar dames like Lucille Ball.
She was one seriously righteous broad.

        The original Star Trek used some of the early great SF writers, including Harlan Ellison, Norman Spinrad, Theodore Sturgeon, Robert Bloch and Richard Matheson. It also obviously was influenced by Asimov’s “I, Robot.” It did have a tendency to resort to esoteric trickery, such as the Vulcan Mind Meld, to move the plot along.

        Heinlein’s masterpiece “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress” is a perfect example of sci-fi predicting the future…Written in the early ’60s, it predicts a sentient computer AI helping the Moon settlers defeat tyranny by the Earth’s government, and describes it quite plausibly… When the AI’s programmer asks it how they can possibly defeat Earth’s government, the AI replies “throw rocks” with a sort of slingshot from Moon’s low gravity…Which indeed works….It’s never been made into a movie, though Heinlein’s satiric Starship Troopers has….

        I think science fiction is defined as a dramatic story whose narrative and philosophical underpinnings are based upon the following:human nature and how humans behave in relation to technology where they may behave differently in its absencehow a technology forces human beings to confront challenges that amplify or distort existing human social dynamicsBy those standards I think RoboCop is an excellent sci-fi movie. What is interesting is in that film, the existing social dynamics of third-world/savage-populations level crime creates an impulse for applying mechanical technology as a solution. Of course, in that movie we see that the crime is exploited as a means to sell technology as a solution.I believe we are living through RoboCop right now. Someone in 2020 unleashed a massive crime wave designed to bring society to its knees and beg for surveillance, automated and centralized policing.What is also interesting but not addressed in that movie, is that it is Occidental man’s social technology that is superior. We have very low crime, high conscientiousness, high trust societies. Ironically, rather than innovating to solve social ills with mechanical technology, we were free to innovate to solve material deficits. I think this would be a cool movie theme. A RoboCop society somehow alongside an all ethnic European society that sees them intersect and shows the viewer in a subtle way which is a downward spiral and which is a path to something higher.There is a lot we don’t need to invent as solutions to problems, if we could separate and just not have those problems at such a chronic scale. Funny enough, the original Star Trek was often on the cusp of such interesting philosophical and civilizational questions.

            That era of “camp” sci-fi, like Zardoz and Barbarella, had a wise premise (sometimes consciously): The standard Asimov-like sci-fi future is impossible because human nature is too low.
Well, here we are in the future. Nobody’s on the moon. The man who claims he’ll take humanity to Mars is a retarded drug addict who can’t even keep hisbaby mama dramaoff the network he owns. Etc.

        Film is a terrible medium for sci-fi to begin with. It’s telling that one of the two top sci-fi movies mentioned by Zman was much better as a book, and it wasn’t even the best sci-fi books by that author.

It’s just a genre that doesn’t do well outside of its traditional home of the written word.

            No offense intended to Terry Gilliam, but “Brazil” is a rather obvious re-telling of Orwell’s “1984”.
I’m also of the thought that Kim Greist, as the love interest, was smoking hawt.
Thank Goodness Gilliam wasn’t able to deploy any of the j00esses he had been lusting after [such Ellen Barkin &amp; Jamie Lee Curtis].
I don’t know why Gilliam had the h@rd-on for the j00esses.
[Maybe he knew from experience that the j00esses were more likely to “put out”?]

        I learned a long time ago to not expect good science fiction films or television programs.  Certainly nothing that will match the very best written science fiction.  That said, I would pick the following three as the top three films- the already mentioned “Blade Runner” and “2001- A Space Odyssey” along with “The Andromeda Strain”.
Television shows seem even less fulfilling than film to me.  “The Expanse” was probably the best science fiction television show I have seen and it got 5 seasons to tell its story.  “Fringe” was pretty good, too, but in a different way.

        I feel the 1951 version of The Day the Earth Stood Still with Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal is a classic. The message at the end is really simple: stay the hell out of our backyard or we will blow you the hell away. Also hard to miss the Christ like rendering of Klattu.

            Are flying saucer movies sci-fi or monster movies? Spielberg’s War of the Worlds, incidentally, is a terrific film, sci-fi or not.

                I suppose most flying saucer movies are monster flicks. They are mostly wanting to destroy the Earth or dine on us. Then of course it becomes a feel good movie as we Earthlings unite and defeat them.As an aside, a favorite spoof of the genre is Mars Attacks. I couldn’t stop laughing when it was revealed Slim Whitman was the solution!

The “advanced alien civilization lectures dirty, warlike humans” trope is rather naively optimistic, I think.

        yes and no, maybe?If a man can beat up the technologically advanced Predator 3 times his own size…it takes a little work but maybe you can expect Girlboss to beat him up too? Why not? But I get what you’re saying, Z.I just finished binging on Caprica. I watched it ALL. I don’t think you guys woulda made it beyond the second episode. You can’t ruin a series like that so I’ll make the long story short: it’s the prequel to Battlestar Galactica. It’s about two dead teenage bubblegummer girl bosses that live in virtual reality on the internet. The young girl bosses hate their parents and ghost them. They guilt trip them, estrange and reject them. The parents must come to the realization that their little girl bosses know what’s best for everyone and accept their wisdom and authority. The sci-fi aspect is provided by the setting: a technological society run by women and queers. The men are all beta male flimps that do what the women tell them to. Protochristians are the bad guys that want to blow up the world and kill everyone. Somehow these people can run an interplanetary empire… and from that the authors can springboard onto other unoriginal derivative sub plots and do the gender/race swap thing on them too.It would be a dystopian hellscape for normal people…but Space Utopia for the Usual Suspects that have hijacked our culture. The only reason I watched it all is that my estranged militant lesbian daughter loved that kind of shite… and if you put it under the microscope it tells you a lot about the people that write it and enjoy it.As our Esteemed Blog Host notes, sci-fi holds up the mirror where all your warts and zits and imperfections reflect back at you. That’s the last thing Girlboss wants. Shitty science fiction is how she dolls herself up for that mirror to hide all that crap. she needs a mirror to show her what she wants to see.I suppose the men do it too these days.But whadda I know? Shut your hole, Filthie!😂

But that is not what happens in the Predator film. The humans are no match physically. In both cases, they exploit the home planet advantage and get a little lucky. In the girl boss films, she is the only one who exists outside the physical constraints of the world created for her. Everyone else is limited by Newtonian physics.

                That”s right… the original was okay. I must have been watching one of the execrable spin-offs. It had a little black girl – flat as a board – beating up the predators AND the aliens.It was incredibly awful.I see two things going on that I think is driving the dearth of real sci-fi:the old school “chick flicks”the new age “message fiction”The girl boss has a place in chick flicks. (Or ‘chick-lit’). Those are stories for women, and we are not the intended audience. It’s largely harmless, IMO…just another genre of story telling.This message fiction is not. Those stories are about driving an agenda. Typically the writers learn their craft in workshops. These are the cretins that recently produced the seriesThe Last Of Usas an example. On OyTube, the Critical Drinker has gone catatonic after watching it. The point of the story is to push LGBTQ, feminism and feminist rage.The only way to deal with it is with your wallet. Stop going to movies that push this shite.

        Where does a movie likeThe Omega Man(1971) fit?  It’s a remake of a movie (The Last Man on Earth) which is clearly not science fiction.  That movie was based on a novelI Am Legend, by Richard Matheson.  In the 1971 version Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) is a scientist who’ simultaneously fighting and seeking a cure for the portion of humanity who have been turned into vampire-like creatures by mutations of biological warfare weapons.  The early part of the film is pretty good, focusing on Neville’s psychological struggle to remain sane.  The second part of the movie deteriorates into an implausible and inconsistent plot.  But the scene where Neville debates Mathias (played superbly by Anthony Zerbe) over the merits of technological progress is really quite profound.

            Agreed, when they brought in the groovy 70s race-mixing love interest, it pretty much fell to squat, as if they had forgotten the plot.
But the mutations of biological warfare weapons? Oh yeah, that turned it into real science fiction. I’m still waiting for the vaccinated to go haywire when they activate the 5G signal network.

            The Omega Man is one of my favorite movies. More social commentary than science fiction. The subtext in the New World Order is that Heston is the monster, so he goes out like one.

            Yeah, but the miscegenation scenes totally made me hate this movie.  Many don’t realize that long before Heston became Pres of the NRA, he was a pretty hardcore lefty, even marching with MLK in the 60s.  His other two sci-fi movies of that era (POTA and Soylent Green), were much better IMO.

        When I read liberals defending this girlboss slop they’ll say something like “you’re talking about fiction where &lt;dragons fly around&gt;/&lt;there is time travel&gt;/&lt;people fly through black holes&gt;/etc. and you’re complaining about girlbosses being implausible” and the only answer is yes, the girlbosses are far MORE implausible than dragons flying around, because we know girls in our lives and we know how ridiculous the girlboss construct is. Anyone who has seen a woman throw a punch knows that Atomic Blonde is silly. It doesn’t mean Atomic Blonde isn’t entertaining in a vacuum, it is, but when literally every piece of fiction is centered on the girlboss (the new John Wick is like this) then the entire premise collapses for all of them. It’s like a tragedy of the commons problem.

        I may not be qualified to say which one is better, but I can say that I enjoyed Starship Troopers a lot more than either 2001 or Blade Runner. On Rotten Tomatoes list of top 150 scifi movies, Troopers is below Barbarella. A few weeks ago I finally got around to watching the original Mad Max. I’m kind of at a loss as to what about it inspired all the sequels. Maybe it was better in the context of its time than it is now.

            I’ll duke it with anyone over any Mad Max, especially Mad Max: Thunderdome.
The girlboss “remakes”, however, should be burned at the stake, their writers with them.
An awesome Australian series we could consider a precursor to Mad Max:Mr. Nobody.
What made Mad Max great was the slow decay of lawless anarchy, to where nothing really mattered. A film not about the whiz-bang, but about culture: surely relevant, prescient to today. We never knew if somebody pressed the button because they didn’t give a schmidt anymore, or if it all just fell apart.

            Mad Max had a kind of 70s indie cred that was common among so-called auteurs. The same people who glaze kung fu,  spaghetti westerns and zombie flicks. It was good enough, considering its low budget.
The Road Warrior is great. Beyond Thunderdome is half great, half garbage (everything actually beyond Thunderdome sucks).
Of the more recent sequels, I shall not speak.

            The opening chase inMad Maxis still awesome. The, “last of the V8s,” intro scene is looking awfully prescient in this day and age.
Road Warriorups the ante in terms of the chase scenes. The, “You wanna get outta here…you talk to me!” scene is up there with, “Come with me…if you want to live!” in terms of great one-liners.

        Star wars is considered “science fantasy” and not true science fiction. I would suggest aliens, more than alien, was true science fiction in the sense that we see humans in space as prey rather than conqueror as our technological arrogance blinds us and we are reduced to primitive fears and irrationality.

        I prefer the more dystopian sci-fi flicks where instead of robots and time travel there is doom, gloom, and misery.  Films like Gibson’s Road Warrior movies, 1984 (not as good as the book of course but still a great movie), and my all-time favorite, Soylent Green. Yes, some will say it’s campy, but it’s a good lesson that when people get hungry, all the woke luxury beliefs vanish. For example, in the SG world women are reduced to “furniture”.  Girl bosses are ancient history.Speaking of Kubrick movies, how about A Clockwork Orange?  Certainly a dystopian movie but is it sci-fi?  If so, I kick SG to #2 on my list and put ACO as #1.

            I would draw a distinction between futuristic/dystopia stories and scifi. You can have the former without the latter. Such as Children of Men. But ACO, with its mind reconditioning program, you could maybe call scifi. Barely.

What about post-nuclear war scenarios? Like the ones portrayed in either version ofOn the Beach(1956 &amp; 2000)? Or something more plausible like the bookTrinity’s Childor its filmed versionBy Dawn’s Early Light, even though they have the requisite women’s lib pilot character?

        Total Recall – the original 1990 version – is campy, violent, and mindless, but underneath that veneer, it’s a story about a man looking to find himself and know who he is as he struggles with morality and what it means to be human. By that standard, it’s science fiction.

        Star Warsgets placed near the top because the lists are usually targeted to people who consume corporate slop.Star Warsmay not technically be science fiction, but it’s neither corporate nor slop (unless you’re talking about the Disney company’s rubbish).Asimov famously said that science fiction is about how humans react to changes in science and technology.Bradbury (not quite so famously) said that the best science fiction film of all time (using Asimov’s definition) wasSinging the Rain.The argument againstAlienis that it is also a monster movie, so there is a category dispute.Alienis a well-shot but extremely creaky haunted house rail-car ride of a film.Aliensis vastly superior.

        I sort of disagree. All science fiction is a “McMuffin” as Z says, as any sci-fi concept, when examined by a true expert in its field will be found absurd.(unless not, when it would become an actual scientific concept, lol). Back to the future, while obviously very light, is science fiction in that it is an examination of generational differences. The things that happened in Star Trek are magic with some scientific babble thrown in. The difference between sci-fi and say fantasy, is the origins of the magic. In fantasy, or horror I guess, the effects are based upon an unknown uncontrollable world. Gods and goddesses control the world and mankind is helpless to understand them. The effects in science fiction come from human progress and technology. In science fiction, there is the common belief in the progress of human rationalism and technology, and the perfection of the human condition through the common cause of rationalism in scientific inquiry. This is the spirit of Star Trek, which spirit was created by Jules Vern.  Star Wars, on the other hand, is a romantic revolt against the technological. In Star Wars, you have these gigantic machines that have run awry and allowing a dictator to control the universe through the death star. The force represents the revolt of the human spirit against an overly Technology dystopia. The key scene, of course, is where he takes off the guidance system at the end and trust his spirits or whatever. Star Wars derives from Dune actually. Star Wars is Dune vulgarized for the masses.Im liking this so I want to continue. The subtext of dune, obviously, is the Arab Israeli conflict. The Freemen or whatever represent Arabs, the spice, oil. It is about the will of these primitive people to resist all the might and technological genius of the west, their resolve and fighting spirit have (failingly) resisted western conquest for many generations. Technological superiority is not everything.

        I’d be hard-pressed to pick the best SF movies. Would need about a week to think about it. Obviously everything since about 2012 (2nd term of Black Jesus, when the race war truly kicked off and the Great Replacement took off its mask) has been crap. It’s not the composition of the cast, it’s the BS message. Furthermore, if we have a Diverse Writer he/she can produce anything and we’re expected to clap like trained seals.

        I highly recommend “Attraction” and “Attraction 2” – both in the genre of science fiction about an alien spacecraft that crash lands in Moscow. The English dub versions are ok, except for the one voicing for Irina Starshenbaum. The visuals are absolutely stunning – worth seeing for this alone. The Russians make great movies that absolutely do not look like 90% of US TV commercials if you knowwhutI’msaying.﻿
