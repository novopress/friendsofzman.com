        An acquaintance who spent a year in Kirkut with the Army claimed that the best thing the US could do was to arm the shit out of the Kurds, and let them take over whatever part of Iraq they wanted. That part would be clean, peaceful, and, if not completely friendly toward the US, not hostile.
The rest of Iraq would revert to the shithole it always was.

        You ask ‘why we have ignored these [kurdish] people is a mystery’… I suspect that the realpolitik cold calculus of retaining Turkey as a NATO member and potential thorn in Russia’s southern flank outweighed the benefits of Kurdish independence.  Of course with Erdogan in office, maybe the Turks aren’t in our long term plans any more?

        This is what you get when you randomly make “nations” like was done after WWI. And I notice all the maps showing ISIS territory comes to a screeching halt at the Turkish border.

            Iran is an interesting case. Arabs started conquering the area with the rise of Islam. On the other hand, Bronze Age Persians conquered their neighbors. Iran has also been a major center for trade and commerce, bringing all sorts of people into close proximity. Iran is a good example of how environment can alter the genetic makeup of the people.What you see with Iran is something we keep seeing whenever Islamic fanatics take over. They are terrible at large scale administration. There’s no reason for Iran to be an economic mess, but it is and the reason is public administration is corrupt and dysfunctional.
