        ‘The coming peace in the culture war is a false dawn’
There is no peace. Your enemies are reloading, furious that their Glorious Future has been delayed by . . . you. There is no peace.
USAID was barely a beginning. Folks act like some permanent victory has been achieved. You are still the Hated People to the elite and to a significant portion of the nation.  All institutions work to your detriment.
‘True peace only comes when freaks are permanently forced to the margins’
Forced somewhere. To the margins is one option.

            Mass hangings should be done not on the margins but in the center of town for all to see. To serve as a warning to future generations.

        The Dem party is not getting rid of its freaks. I would argue they’re not even going into hiding. They’re still all-in on the progressive stack and pronoun policing. Jasmine Crockett became a rising star in the Democratic party once she started performing like a ratchet ghetto black woman. They are talking about spending $20 million to get a left-wing Joe Rogan, well they used to have a left-wing Joe Rogan, he was named Joe Rogan. He left because the freaks started attacking him for daring to talk to people to the right of Chairman Mao, and prominent Dems refused to go on his program. They won’t be able to find the left-wing Joe Rogan because that person will have to be somewhat normal and freaks are spiritually repulsed and disgusted by normal people. It is why Gavin Newsom has no future in the Democratic Party – and he knows it.

            Back in the early oughts the freaks were so furious about the success of “rightwing” talk radio that they endeavored to create a Leftist talk radio network. Presumably without irony, they called it Air America. Despite lavish support from the plutocrats, it staggered off to history’s slag-heap after a six-year run.
One reason the freaks never quit is because they never learn.

                They also have an endless supply of money.  Some of it is coming from government NGOs, but their big donors throw a lot of money around. Air America was a short term embarrassment to them, but did no damage to their patronage network.  It helped keep their people employed.

                    Conservatives are not and have never been in the game. Especially with this “go woke go broke” stuff. They think that “the market” is the point. The freaks realize it is not. It is about their patronage network and building a system where freaks can maintain the freakish life they want to live. So they’ll defend it forever. And the system will reward them for that loyalty. Cons don’t get this and never will. It’s not about facts or income cash flow, it’s about power.Of course this is looking at it from just a materialist perspective. There’s also the fact that they are demonically possessed, and as such are repulsed by the Good, Beautiful, and True. I don’t see how you could look at say 2020 Antifa mug shots and not see both of these elements at play.

                        According to Leftist dogma, anybody who wants to should be able to write deconstructionist, postcolonial poetry by day, and get his bum punched by night. And get paid for it.

                        Very well said.  Every last freak that loses its job/fame will be propped up and paid by the leftist patronage system.  The ‘right’ provides no such safety net, but rather turns its back on those doxxed by the left.  Only in the case of Shiloh Hendricks did Whites actually provide genuine aid.  And yes, it’s money and the power and control it buys.  And no, reason and logic and facts have zero impact.  Even if Trump was mustache man, there is no way to undo in four (or eight or twelve) years what took 50 to achieve. AINO is toast, but people continue to grab at straws.

                        This is why they defend every single government program.  They have their hooks in all of them.
I’ve been saying a long time that welfare is the least of our problems when it comes to people on the dole.  Welfare recipients are simply incapable of inflicting the kind of damage the professional dole recipient can inflict.  They are getting paid to wreck society.  BLM is the perfect example.  All of these patronage networks need to be eliminated and every single person benefiting sent to prison.

                        ‘There’s also the fact that they are demonically possessed, and as such are repulsed by the Good, Beautiful, and True’
Influence is more common. Full possession is rarer. But you are correct that at core it is spiritual warfare and yes, malevolent entities do exist, and in great number.
The enemy doesn’t want the good, beautiful and true, because they are none of these things. They want to continue building their Inclusive Daemonium. ‘Do What Thou Wilt’ is their code and law.

                        Exactly. The market does not matter. Always wondered how expensive movies could flop, but like the high art world, it is a con. I think there are a lot of payoffs and bribes. It is about social power, network and connections. There was a great RT analysis about Harvard and its’ endowment yesterday: Elite Western Universities form a corrupt and parasitic empire, by Dr. Matthew Maavak.That world ought to be investigated and publicized in MSM, but they cannot have the truth come out. We would all look like fools, knowing they are deceiving us. 404 too, they allowed a million men to perish, not because they believe in democracy, but for their MIC buddies and offshore accounts.Thanks to reading Larry, MoA, Strategic Culture, RT, LRW etc, and the astute comments, I have been rehabilitated and debunked. Fully unindoctrinated since 2020, no TV since 2000. I turned away from Liberterianism since they embraced lockdowns, and did not question MSM. As a healthcare provider I knew I had to read Pfizer’s EAU paper.From there it was a small step to realizing the entire history that had been fed to me from birth was a mirage. Especially the endless wars, many, if not all, started with a false flag. Or coups. What the US has done to the world, the ~20 million killed since 1945, its’ politicians ought to get on their knees, and beg for forgiveness. Or commit harakiri.

                        One of the things that makes the denizens of places like Portland, OR so insane is that most of them are totally dependent on the whole non-profit/NGO/Government patronage network. Most of them have built their entire careers in that hothouse and have no skills that apply in the real world. Let’s see, you were a Grant Administrator for the Gender Pathways Enhancement Foundation making 200k/yr – here’s a job as a bookkeeper for an auto repair shop in Tulsa making 35k/yr.Even in the best of times, which for them was the 4 year Weekend at Brandon’s, they are nervous because they know this on some level. When Trump got in the first time they completely lost their minds, fearing that they would have to return in disgrace and humiliation to their redneck towns in Flyover Land**. My wife’s bus was attacked during those riots that awful first Trump winter in Portland.I was expecting (and sort of hoping) that they would burn the city again after the Re-Trumpening. I’m actually not that surprised that they didn’t though. They probably realize that they panicked for nothing back in ’17. Trump didn’t derail their Leftist Money choo-choo after all. I still wonder if they might do a little arson and Kristallnachting this summer now that the weather is nice. They ARE terrified of DOGE and probably hate Musk more than Orange Hitler at this point.** It’s amazing listening to these people talk about themselves. It seems like virtually everyone here is from the South or the Midwest. It’s almost like the way Christians have a conversion story. They will have their horror tale of growing up in the patriarchal, misogynistic Heartland and how glad they are to have made it to the Left Coast. This is perhaps also why they were and are so terrified of losing their handouts. As overpriced as Portland is, it’s thecheapestbig city on the Wrong Coast. Next stop is back to Tulsa and Big Jimmy’s Auto Repair.

                Well, “right wing” radio has become an utter farce. I was in the garage yesterday working on my motorcycle and “Clay and Buck” came on after the news was over, and ALL they were talking about was Israel, Israel, Israel. Every. Single. God. Damn. Time. that show comes on it’s nothing but blather about fucking Israel.I have gotten to the point where every time it comes on I drop what I’m doing and shut it off, or tune in classic country.I listen to a fair amount of radio and always have, but I just can’t take the so-called “conservative” shit any more, it’s really insufferable.

                    Once you realize it’s a grift, you lose interest.  For me that happened around 2012.  Rush was still reliably good, but the rest were very bad.  Then Trump won and half of them went full NeverTrump (Levin, Shapiro, etc).  Shapiro became downright aggravating and unlistenable with his “The Liberals have a point…” schtick.When Rush died, that was the end of it for me.  I stream music now since radio is nothing but drug ads and snake oil and they preprogram all the music no DJ.  I can stream on Apple Music and get that without commercials.The only thing I listen to on the radio anymore is baseball.  But since I’m not in the local market for my team, I’m streaming WIP out of Philly.  There’s something about baseball on the radio that I love.

Probably; but I would warn you that attempting to reverse-engineer any particular person’s true motivations is an undertaking fraught with not just commonplace error but ackshual existential error.
Be very very careful about assuming that you understand another human being’s true motivations.

                It started in the early 90’s during Clinton’s first term. They began searching for their own “Rush Limbaugh” after they pinned the car bombing they received in the 94 mid-terms on Rush. Their solution? Mario Cuomo. God Almighty talk about an unmitigated disaster! He lasted for a little over a year and the show achieved nothing. I had a job where I did quite a bit of driving back then and the company car only had an am radio, so I was forced to listen to a great deal of this drivel. Cuomo, even after several months of being on the air, was completely out of his element. His response to callers who disagreed with him was to tell them to shut up and then he dropped them. He was also dreadfully boring, it wasn’t even a lecture to listen to, he would ramble a bit and then pause, sometimes for almost ten seconds and that’s a lifetime on live air.Their new Joe Rogan is some fugly, land mass. Yeah, good luck with that.

                Ah, good old Gov. Newsance. He is temporarily ditching some of the crazier Dem positions because he has presidential ambitions. That is the extent of his normality. I do mean temporary. If he ever did get elected, he would re-embrace all the craziness.

            The pendulum swung hard right in 2024 and will swing back hard left in 2028. As society goes down the pan, the oscillations from one side to the other will only get wilder. As people get tired of Trump not achieving anything, many will stay at home in 2028 and the maniacs will return. After that, I doubt the US will be able to hold together.

        These people, whatever label they get or deserve, will stop at nothing. They will eat their own, counting on spawning new David Hoggs, or other such offspring, as needed.Case in point is this alleged ‘sports’ organization known as the “WNBA.”They will not brook any sense of white identity, even if it means sending shemale goons to break the limbs of their golden goose — even if SHE prostrates self by ‘singing the insurance company song’ next to the basketball human, or repeating the lies about her “privilege.”Right off, falsely accuse fans of being “racist”, no filter on black racists running mouths, flashing tatts, breasts, and seeking to injure the enemy woman.These people are not concerned with ‘money’ — they think ‘electricity’ comes form the wall socket … and same for greenbacks. There is little to prove their premise wrong, see this week’s Bieber woman becoming the latest stunning and talented female ‘billionaire’ and get back to what?Watching Trump try and badger Powell into getting us back to fake 0% ‘interest rates’ so savers can kiss their interest incomes goodbye by hey, we can all get loans for $100k pickup trucks … at least not those whytefolks hitting the road with a coffee can and a spoon.There are MORE freaks now than ever.

        So, interesting observation this morning shortly after I read Zman’s intro post:  on my iPhone if I swipe left, I get a list of news items selected by the bots that write the news.  These are typically, universally, hard left wing “news” and I never subscribe to the service that lets me read the “news”.Anyway, this morning the lede for one of the “news” items read, “Illegal immigrant who crashed into 24 year old woman, killing her, only sentenced to pro…”I was rather surprised by this.  A quick web search located the free article and the story is about a 15-year old illegal who was racing at 90+ mph and T-boned a woman in her car.  She was killed instantly.  The DA for Aurora, CO allowed a plea deal with probation and some “community service”.  Absolutely shocking that the illegal got a pat on the head.  But that’s Colorado for you these days.The real shock was Apple showing it AT ALL on my news feed:https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-prosecutor-offers-unlicensed-undocumented-teen-probation-deadly-crash/The problem isn’t that these people are going underground.  They aren’t.  They’re completely untethered to reality or the law.  Until people like that DA face terminal consequences for their madness, nothing will change.

            Yep, the DA’s are now the issue thanks to Soros efforts.  A couple of generations ago it was lenient judges until we set minimum penalties in law restricting the judge’s sentencing prerogatives.  Don’t know how to handle DA’s—except through election, and you know the problem with that.

                    Can’t do that, OK.  Our “dissident” host has more than once censored my comments pointing out that in certain instances, kinetic action against the spiteful mutants Euro decedents on our side of the genetic ledger, as well as the colorful nihilist children in adult bodies, is a necessity, not a luxury, in the Survival Games.If you want to be honest in comments, go to “Dissident Thoughts” by Arthur Sido.  Now there’s a blog with genuine free speech.    At DT, observations are keen, expressed forcefully and directly.Now, of course, some commenters at Dissident Thoughts can’t see how some limited strategic partnerships with single females and colored citizens can be useful in the fight of all against all, but that’s a tactical judgement.  When The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence problem arrives, the time for fancy words dies.  Survival is the only value with any genuine value.

        A comment on vaccines for kids.  We have found many of them are combined now, so it is hard refuse certain ones and get others.  I am sure RFK Jr. is aware of that, but it would be a good area to focus on especially making it easier to refuse vaccines like Hep B, which are worthless to everyone not being raised by a degenerate.  I am curious if hospitals will follow through on dropping the Covid vax for kids.  Our pediatrician has never pushed it, but checking right now, it is still recommended on their online chart. I have a feeling there will be a fair amount of defiance from the medical system on that one.

                Covid Vaccination rates for kids are low, especially under 5.  A good doctor won’t even offer to parents unless they ask for it.  Getting it off the schedule is important to prevent the zealots from pushing it on scared or ignorant parents proactively.

                        Interestingly though, there’s a minority of the same cohort that was against vaccines well before COVID. I guess some of the highest non-vaccination rates are in liberal, high end neighborhoods.

                Getting the Covid vex off the recommended schedule will open doctors and hospitals to law suits for adverse effects since there is no longer a recommendation (standard of care) for use in that age group.  Suits for compensation would not be handled by the Fed’s indemnity exclusion, which picks up liability for “legitimate” use only.  Fed’s and insurance, will no longer pick up the costs for this “voluntary” vex.You can be damn sure the hospitals/doctors will stop when word gets around that it’s their asses on the line and parents will as well when they understand they have to pay for the vex.

ANY PERSON, child, or adult, who has been v@xxinated, will almost certainly fail to have grandchildren or great grandchildren.
By the third generation, the genealogical bloodlines will be completely sterile [if not already non-existent].

Yep.
And just about every single Normie is still blissfully unaware that nearly every Conspiracy Theory did indeed come true.
I wonder what Scott “The Clot” Adams thinks about this?
Or is “The Clot” now too absorbed in his own solipsism to worry about the balance of the species?
No one, not in the dissident community, and surely not in the Normie community, is speaking out about the impending existential horror which is the V@xxpocalypse &amp; its aftermath.
Everyone continues to pretend that nothing ever happened.

                        Depopulation in preparation for AI is called “future-proofing” in the vernacular.
Now for the good news: bodily location and digital activity provides the datamining “work” needed to proof a blockchain.
They won’t need exponential electricity generation; they’ll just need us, combined with total surveillance tracking of everything we do or need permissions for…monitored by the AI we are feeding, of course.

                        I do believe that big pharma knew about all the immediate health implications, including the turbo cancers, heart problems, and  lowering of fertility.The concept that a little bit of RNA will produce  DNA decay in future generations is very sketchy. The process of reproduction is so complex, that it would fail to begin with. Personally,I don’t believe that God will let us get out of hand enough to allow humanity fail to reproduce. Globalists can dream of an empty planet with just them and robots. God has other plans.

                            I find it curious that those who espouse the depopulation agenda never seem to consider some of the ramifications if it’s true. I may be over simplifying a bit; if so, then this is my opinion: the mRNA “vaccine” uptake was primarily in “The West” which means that racially, probably the majority of the world’s population of whites in the EU and the former colonies of European powers, with some of the Asians (Japan, maybe a few others). Conversely, mRNA use was virtually nil in Latin America, Africa, or the Eurasian Continent east of the EU.If there is a substantial die-off of people in these regions, of course the worldwide repercussions will be catastrophic. Not the least of those will be that the continued existence of black and brown people is dependent upon inputs from the “First” world…Population control agenda indeed…no need for the poor to have taken the mystery juice; they will be shown to the exit soon enough under the above baleful scenario.

            In states like mine where religious exemptions are allowed, I think you’ve got to object to them all or accept them all. I suppose parents could secretly get the 3 or 4 that have any value and pretend they’ve had none.

                Vaccines are only required to send your kid to public school. I’ll grant makes them theorically mandatory for the vast majority of children. It’s not possible (rather it’s very difficult) to legally require inoculations without emergencies, so it was tied to school attendance. Regular health checks were the other routine that childhood vaccinations were attached to. The system grinds on and works, but there’s precious little there that’s running on legal force. It’s habit and expectations.Even with supposedly mandatory vaccinations, it’s not clear what happens when a parent a)does only part of the schedule and b)insists without public school no school will happen. Many vaccines protect infants from serious disease, not school age children. It seems that in the end a public school would be forced to provide some sort of education, particular if certain vaccinations had nothing to do with older children.

        I found myself in Cambridge, MA for the first time in about a decade recently. First time since becoming dissident. Let me tell you, they aren’t hiding there. Cambridge has to be the east coast capital of the freaks. It’s legitimately hard to find normal people. All kinds of dyed hair, over weight women, alphabet mafia, effeminate men, covidians with masks, the list goes on. Anyone that doubts Ed Dutton’s spiteful mutants theory will be instantly convinced after walking a Saturday night there. It boggles my mind that a Normie republican think, “Yeah if I just formulate the right argument based on logic and facts, we can win them over!”

        Nazi Germany had the right idea with what they called “Protective Custody”  In modern speak, PC is where sex offenders go in the prison system so they don’t get targeted.  But in Germany it was putting  the freaks and weirdos in a prison to protect society from them.Thing is, you wouldn’t need to do it anywhere near 20% of the White population.  You put a few percent of them in protective custody and the rest will find something better to do with their lives.  Today, they are endlessly rewarded for their bad behavior. But in the future when we are in charge, they will be endlessly punished for their bad behavior.  The ones that cannot be helped, well, there is always helicopter rides over the Pacific.

        I was flipping through the TV channels last night, over the air TV. What used to be called the Scripps Howard Spelling Bee was being shown on the Scripps TV networks (Ion, Laff and other channels). I saw the spelling bee in about 4 or 5 places as I was flipping through channels.Of the six finalists on stage, three Indians, one Oriental, and the low bandwidth picture was fuzzy so I couldn’t tell what the other two were, but I think they were Indians or people from around there.The moderator was a pasty-faced white guy.Aside from the jolt to my system from trying to process the demographics of it all, what have the powers that be people done to this country?

            To be fair, it’s been mostly South and East Asians since they first started televising these events a couple decades ago.  It’s not like these kids can (or are allowed to) play sports, which is amusing because the spelling bees were aired on ESPN2.

            Yep.
I live in Small Town, working-class USA. It’s ultra-white. It’s also an anomaly. There are no Jews, no queers, literally a handful of blacks, andoneChinese family that runs the Chinese restaurant.
Couple of days ago I saw the first Muslim girl in this town, ever. She was working as a cashier at the dollar store wearing a headscarf.
My first thought was “WTF, it’s finally starting to happenhere.”
Sad thing, though, is that she was slimmer, prettier, and more polite than the obese, tattooed, trailer-park white trash you usually see in these parts…

                That’s one of the messages of the Eastwood film, Gran Torino. Namely, that domestic whites are turning into garbage while many wogs are behaving like old-time whites. I think it’s less an argument for diversity and more an exhortation for whites to get their shit together, but I suppose it depends on how you look at it.

            Nye and Stewart really are giants—on the most censored parts of the internet. Reddit for example was a majority “Ron Paul libertarian” (nerdy non-Republican right) site, back when its users determined its content. So they were cut away and cut away and cut away again, until it became totally unrepresentative, 99.44% pure bot (and human equivalent). The same people who censored it now look to it to measure public sentiment. They have objective numbers. If the people disagree, it’s they who are irrational and brainwashed.

            Are freaks born? Or are they made?I heard The Empty Wheel referenced in the podcast and went over to check it out. I left a very complimentary comment on the Yarvin article and recommended our Esteemed Blog Host as an alternate.Don’t thank me! I was just trying to culturally enrich our friends on the left the way they have so generally done with us!😊👍I really wonder about the freaks. I get that they live to offend and outrage people but… am I the only one that’s noted by them now? Don’t get me wrong…I’d live to kill them as much as any of you…but until it becomes legal…I just don’t have any wish to be around them outside of the odd shitpoost and insult.

        I would argue that the reason these scourges keep recurring is because there is no functional feedback mechanism for accountability and culling. In theory, press scrutiny and legal action serve this purpose, but it is now plainly obvious that the MSM is complicit in public corruption, as is the judicial system. IOW, the system is broken and cannot be fixed via tinkering around the edges with pretend remedies. Only a collapse can cure what ails us. Only then will a rising step up to solve these problems the old fashion way.

And here I had held so much respect for you, OK.
We all have flaws. But it’s over if you admit to a Boy George poster on the wall.
Mine was letting a chick sell me on listening to Men Without Hats while we made out. No matter how hard I scrub I can never completely wash out the fag-nasties.
It’s on our permanent records.

As to the Air Supply/Iron Maiden show, that was strictly a joke. I mean, can you possibly imagine those two bands touring together? And I’ve never been to Oz. Given their unhinged response to the Covidiocy, doubt I ever will.

                    It’s become such an embarrassment that it’s used in every appeal to Gen Z girlz. “You can do this [usually come to our campus, company, gov’t agency, NGO, etc] andchange the world.” Farce, then tragedy. I’m writing my reminiscences about how the ‘Revolution’ came to the Deep South. Some very strange juxtapositions. Actually, I have a plot line so maybe a novella if I survive long enough. I see it as an antidote to that Harper Lee psyop.

        They talk about how that housing and urban development guy, Jeff Speck, did “work to redesign the downtown of Hammond, Indiana”
Well, Hammond has gone from 60% White in 2000 to 30% White in 2020. Its population has been steadily declining since the ’70s. There’s no sign that Hammond’s “work” is altering those trends (not that Democrats want White replacement to stop).
More than 14% of the population lived below the poverty line in 2000. It’s almost certainly higher now with a much smaller White population.

But that is why they will continue to win. All that matters is getting power and crushing their enemies. Everything else is just a tactic. The ends justifies the means.

            David Duke and George Wallace were the last nationally known pols I remember who publicly and openly supported White people.  Duke did win one term in the  Louisiana House of Reps, as a Republican.  He ran for governor and senator and made a good showing.  But as Wallace would say, “getting close don’t matter, except horse shoes and artillery.”Duke was gaining traction politically so the cabal of Dims and Republicons got him convicted of misuse of campaign money, hahahahahaha.  As David Allen Coe might say,  “Ain’t that a damn good joke, or it’s enough to harelip the pope.”  At worse Duke was a minor grifter.  His political opinions did him in as he talked trash about the sacred colored folk and raged against the J.I think his prosecutor was a tall skinny hack known as “Skeletron” who later formed a company to scam millions by selling x-ray scanners to TSA which were later scrapped.Not aware Duke was an FBI rat.  Any White advocate who gains traction will be tagged with FBI-SPLC informant, perhaps out of jealousy by others less successful.

        Are the oligarchs underwriting this to buy peace? I don’t know. I think most are all on board with it.Remember the Google boys who rode around on their futuristic scooters and then held a post-2016 company meeting to cry and whine about the election of Trump?This is who they are. They are fighting the demons. Walled up in their premium chef cafeterias and sliding down their swirly staircase slides into a bubble ball pile at the age of 50 they run off to their meetings.I just think the oligarchs on the whole are true believers. Underdogs in mind only with no moral compass to guide them out of the evil of moralizing.I hope I am wrong. I don’t think so. Woke isn’t put away on any corporate website or any TV screen.

        FWIW, this is my observation on the level of freaks in Orange County California. Where I live.First, the overwhelming Latino/Mexican influence tends to damp down the Freakoziod influence. Mexicans really are Latino Rednecks. Anyone watching Mexican TV can see the Old West, Sombrero, pistolero, horse riding heritage.What amounts to the crazy is White middle class Wine Moms, who are hard left crazy, but do have kids that tend to limit the craziness.Mexicans have their own thing, certainly anyone familiar with Coatlicue is not going to say that the culture is puppies and rainbows. But it is fundamentally NOT Western Woke Puritan/Calvinist elect.Second, there is a very strong element of Redneckiness in SoCal. For example, you will see a TON of Jeeps. Dudes love to go out to the desert of Santa Ana Mountains / Cleveland National Forest to 4 Wheel. A bunch of motorcycles. A LOT of both Catholic and Revivalist / Pentecostalist Christianity.For example, my late brother and I saw during the Summer of George (Floyd) a bunch of White moms and kids at Irvine City Hall going to what turned out to be a George Floyd protest. Which makes it weaker, a bunch of White Middle Class Moms are not the street fighting force that Anti Fa is, nor is it the kind of political movement that generates power because it appeals to elites and those who control men with guns. Per Mao.My $0.02.

        Did I hear you correctly?
You are unfamiliar with Morgoth?
My God, man, he is essential. As is another Brit, Millennial Woes (Scot). MW was personally destroyed years back when doxed, Morgoth not even dinted. Putting aside that England where Morgoth lives is Draconian enough but not even close to as Draconian as Scotland, the difference between what happened to the two is stark. Peak Dox is long past.

        Freaks are generally unproductive, except for a very few geniuses. The days of society being able to carry its dead weight are coming to an end. DOGE may have largely failed, but in the long run the imperatives of the Technological Republic will not be denied. This not entirely a good thing, as we will all have to justify ourselves to our robot overlords, but the Terminators will come first for the freaks.

            I think a system like this doesn’t punish the freaks.  Those are a lost cause.  Instead it simply demands more from the normal person – heaping up starw upon straw on his back until the snap.  The terminators will only ever come for us.

            If by freaks you mean sexual freaks, it’s traditional for unjust rulers to give them exalted status (compared to normal people) and police powers—especiallymoralpolice powers. The Han eunuch, the pederast priest, and the tranny janny are instances of an eternal archetype.
Freaks are the mind and judgment of the Terminators.
Reminder that the regime’spragmaticargument against ejecting troons from the military was that they’re greatly overrepresented there.

        You know what bothers/irks/confuses/distresses me the most? That as a guy that was born into a caravan (RV without an engine for our stateside cousins!) I have achieved what would be termed “a fairly successful life” which given 3 decades of fkn hard graft from nothing, I fully deserve. My point being that as I increased my wealth and privelidge (money DEFINITELY begets money) I felt an obligation to help others. Primarily through employing them, especially those that weren’t “academic” but were hard working and loyal.i can’t imagine being an “upper-Elite” ala Zuck/Gates/Bezos and having history look back on me (as it inevitably will) in the centuries to come, and viewing me as an even worse “robber baron”.Does anyone have any insight as to why our billionaire-class of today don’t spend their limitless wealth improving the lot of humanity? I find it paradoxically baffling, truly

            I’ll allow for the possibility that the book was better, since I haven’t read it. But that was one very overrated movie. I suspect it was agitprop, part of the movement to deinstitutionalize the insane. Kind of like To Kill a Mockingbird was for the CRA. Kesey’s involvement bolsters this assessment.

        Loved the X show with Peter Brimelow. But I don’t think the freaks will be leaving, or laying low, or even that we are past peak Saint George Floyd .Yes, lots of various Saturday people are upset that the Left views them as “Super Whites” as the Infowars dude said, as well as the Oligarchs not being Saturday! [Elton John apologies] knowing that lawfare would not stop with Trump. But would end up with them being targeted.Dems are promising to strip Elon of his wealth and companies and put him in prison along with Bezos and Zuck. So there is that.I think we are moving toward Civil W4r!. You know the Judges will not stop and will just push to everything. If a Judge can direct military policy and trade policy and immigration policy and minute hiring / firing / spending of the federal government, why can’t a judge simply take Musk’s companies? His wealth? Why can’t a Judge invalidate all White marriages and assign White women to black dudes. Paraguay did that, basically.The men with money are important, but not decisive. The real power lies with a black robe that enforces its power through men with guns. The officer class is ultra woke, and has been for years. The judges and woke officers are not going away, they have real power, no one is going to do violence for Musk, however there are plenty who will for judges or officers.

            True, but then again Dick Morris told him flat out that he had to dump a number of his hard-core left ideas if he wanted to make it to the White House, which he did. Hillary – who always despised Morris – paid no attention to Morris’ advice and that led to the left getting car-bombed in the ’94 mid-terms.

        The hardest part of dealing with the hardcore Left is when one of your own has been seduced by the dark side. Elon Musk has a “woke” child who hates him, and the kid suffers from what Musk calls “the Woke Mind Virus.” The man who is planning on colonizing Mars has to deal with this nonsense and idiocy at home. It is a crying shame. His dilemma, painted in stark colors on the mind’s theater, revolves around whether he should cut the kid off completely or show a measure of support. I recommend total termination; once the body snatchers have you, that’s it, game over.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

                        You are coming to the party late. Greg-AI has been posting for about a year and the tells are numerous. The general agreement is he’s an AI-bot learning the process of response. I could elaborate, but really I don’t have time to educate each new Z-man reader.Here’s one clue. Greg-AI will not respond to this comment. He won’t magically appear again and argue that he’s a real person and specifically quote from any of the commentary here. He simply reads early a Z-man post, drops a vague comment and disappears.  He has as of late become better at commentary, but one still can detect he’s not following the group discussion, nor adding to it.

                    Greg-GPT has made some good posts lately. This is another one of them. He’s right, this ideology is totally insidious and everywhere. It has led to the remarkable uniformity of American elite opinion that we have never really seen in the world history of empires, and until very recently showed no sign of cracking.

                        Even a broken watch tells the correct time twice a day.However, that’s beside the point.  If we let our guard down and begin reading/answering AI-bots, then all is lost.  We will no longer be communicating with our brethren, but being played for fools by those who program and unleash such bot’s.Imagine what havoc could be played by half a dozen AI bot’s purposefully directed to monitor and comment in this discussion group.  One bot could be programmed to be obnoxious, another a contrarian, a third simply argumentative, a fourth distractive, another condescending.  All bot’s effectively programmed to distract from/divert the general group discussion.This is not a game folks, this is opposition to free, but “Rightest” discussion and thought via the Internet.  Our “Leftist” enemies are sure to use this—if not already doing so.What’s the old saying of economists?  “Bad money drives out good.”  I can see a similar effect from AI-bots concerning speech.

                            Yes, you are correct. Gresham’s Law: given a choice between two forms of money with the same nominal value but different intrinsic values, the natural desire is to keep the valuable and spend the less valuable. In 1932, your $20 double Eagle and $20 paper money were worth the same amount. Today that gold coin is still legal tender at $20, although you can get a few dollars more at a coin dealer…
