        I love the comment about people with no dignity rising to the top .  It applies to every career I’ve had as well, but then again maybe dignity is just pride, and there’s a relationship to how much we can abandon and how much financial success or fame we achieve

        “Hershel Walker, the former football star, is running for Senate in Georgia. Doctor Oz is running for Senate in Pennsylvania. In both cases, their reason to be in the race is they are famous.”
Man, I get a lot of hate in normiecon circles when I remind them that Walker’s only marketable skill is “runs very fast.” Thou shalt not dis the black conservative!

        “The comments have been getting bombed by Ukrainian bots, which is why moderation has been so immoderate. This was part of the public relations campaign around the recent offensive.”
But how do you know it’s not a secret operation by Putin posting pro-Uke comments to clog up the sites of right thinking Men of The West?

Maybe his problem is he’s using his arms instead of his mind.

        Modern democracy is just a large, interlocking circle of bribery.  Everyone must be bought, from the very top to the very bottom.  Which is why, as John Adams mentioned, it bankrupts itself.  He also mentioned that it dies a “violent death.”  I do believe that our death will be violent.  Nearly every man woman and child in the country, regardless of age, has come to depend on this system for their very sustenance.  For instance, millions have been literally born into this world because of programs like WIC that wouldn’t have ordinarily been born into the world.   Despite Planned Parenthood, a natural reaction of the clown elite in society attempting to keep a lid on democracy’s dysgenic nature, the programs in place have created a culture, of all races by the way, that literally can’t survive outside this clown show system.Democracy will die violently because when the public debt based free lunches stop, many will be at Haitian living standards, they’re going to be soooooo pisssssed.  Including former middle class boomer who thought he could ride Medicare into the grave, maybe they won’t be at Haitian levels, but something like Guatemalan or Mexican.   Everyone will be upset.

            It’s going to be a while.  Eventually we will be like Argentina, but I think it will take another 50-100 years.  I could be wrong, one never knows, but we are in for a much more tumultuous time.

        S.E. Cupp was always trying to imitate Kennedy who already had the lock on sassy Libertarian who was photographed naked on a Motorcycle in the 90’s.  The fact that Kennedy is a déclassé bohemian was part of her selling feature.  Cupp couldn’t compete.  Like Quiznos trying to compete with Subway.

Wny the Quiznos hate? They both suck, of course, but I always found Q to be way better than Subway; their “fixin’s” look like they pay homeless people to harvest them from dumpsters. Also, didn’t their commercial mascot (talk about shameless performers) turn out to be a child molester?

                It doesn’t matter.  Subway already had the hammer lock and they both suck.  Subway hit critical mass and dominated.  Despite hiring a Jewish child molester as a mascot.

            That’s a good reminder that it’s been current_year for a long time. When Kennedy said she wasn’t voting for Clinton in ’92 it was a media-world-shaking controversy that went on for years. In ~1996-7, when she was the most famous music media personality, friends of mine in popular bands were afraid to get *caught* talking to her.

                Yes,  Quiznos was the first to have that roll-through oven.  And then what?  Subway put in ovens to toast their garbage food and goodbye Quiznos.

        Our leaders are a reflection of ourselves in many ways, or perhaps it might be better to say they reflect on our culture. And a lot of this is our fault as dissidents. We let this happen. If we don’t do something, these clowns will go to far, and be swept aside by a strong man, either from the left or the right… and it will be possible that won’t be good for any of us…

                The people we are up against will not stop. They are psychopaths and lunatics that will have to BE stopped.
We can do it ourselves as reasonable adults… or we can let them run until an even more brutal lunatic comes along to stop them for us. The body counts only go up from here…

                    Yup.
There is plenty of evidence for this out in the open.
I just watched a breakdown of the Australian government’s plan to use climate change as an excuse to stage an endless series of plandemics with the end goal of injecting as much mRNA and other junk into people as they possibly can.

        She averred to GQ she was none too sure of living till the end of this month, i.e. September 2022. I’ve seen politicians make blustery forecasts, especially ahead of an election, and engage in all the typical football-coach puffery, but why say something *so* likely to be thrown back in your face later? What’s the theory? And don’t the dirty evangelical doomsday preachers earn scorn for this too (despite rehearsing a much-needed recurring role to our Harvey Weinsteinian media’s design)? I guess I could be the rube who doesn’t appreciate grand press strategery as performed here by Mx. Cortez— I could see her getting the meeting from some Madison Avenue political consultant, “This season normal GOTV ploys don’t work, you have to predict your own death” and her deliberating over this among other options.Also, if her primary audience in Gentleman’s Quarterly was other young women (and numerically insignificant but culturally influential gays)— well, duh, they tend to have a higher threshold and acceptance for everyday drama and not hold any excessively emotionalized utterances against each other, as long as the statement serves in-group solidarity and has a quantum of poetic truth. Shelby Steele writing on St. Trayvon observed of poetic truth, that it has the same relation to actual truth as poetic justice does to actual justice.

        I hadn’t heard of Alex Stein, so I took a quick look on YouTube.  This is just a guy in a clown suit, who does that familiar routine of an upset customer, whipping out the smartphone, demanding to speak to the manager, and verbally abusing the employee.  It’s the kind of humor that does not last long, and won’t advance anything.
A better option is to find some way to get mediocre intellects like Eyepatch Crenshaw and AOC to do something close to the right thing, even when they don’t want to.

            The more he gets these people to make fools of themselves, the less anyone is going to take them seriously.  Crenshaw becomes Pirate McCain instead of Mister War Hero, and AOC is Big Booty Latina instead of Miss Champion of the Proletariat.

            “A better option is to find some way to get mediocre intellects like Eyepatch Crenshaw and AOC to do something close to the right thing, even when they don’t want to”Oh great, post the link to where youre following this obviously superior strategy!  Oh… so you dont have one actually?  So you’re not actually doing anything?  Too hard?  No idea how to start?  Never put in the work to build a public presence like Stein has?Dont be the fat guy on the couch with the cheeto stained shirt talking about how the bronze medalist boxer sucks because he doesnt throw the jab enough.  We’ve got precious few people stepping forward to do ANYTHING, much less publicly and under their own name.  That’s hard enough without people ostensibly on the same side constantly throwing peanuts from the sidelines.

                There’s no need to pick on Stein who doesn’t pretend to be something beyond an entertainer. I do think some DR are gulled into this suburban-college-liberal mindset of “Entertainment celebs &amp; Jon Stewart are our truest leaders and ego-bearers”–might work for them, doesn’t work for us. Limbaugh the accomplished entertainer was a negative for dirt people since he pushed the agenda of crappy Mitch Daniels types onto us as component product. In fact, politicians are garbagemen brought on for a time-limited job, not anointed metrosexual priests for the bi-flock.By the way, back in the Obama years I remember the Con Inc. sites tried to imitate The Daily Show with their own strained take on this inherently metro-lib, overproduced theatre format actually invented as a means of pandering to ad men–becoming White Liberal Church was just a happy accident for it. It’s difficult to justify this as a landmark disgrace for Con Inc. because the perpetrators surely realized they were doing efficient “satire” corn-slop for the pigs and were merely grifting accordingly.

        “No Dignity in Democracy” Zman, you should slap that on a bumper sticker and sell it.
In close connection with the democratic mindset, the proliferation of mass media seems to have facilitated an environment in which many of humanity’s worst flaws get plastered across and/or rewarded on the public stage. It has likely always been that way to one extent or another, given the propensity of freaks to draw eyeballs. Mass media nearly amplify the phenomenon to heretofore unprecedented levels. Global “celebrity” is largely a modern-era perversion.

        There is a newspaper front page lampooning Trump; it is a photoshopped image of Trump with a clown nose and clown makeup on. The title is “CLOWN THROWS NOSE INTO THE RING.”Although Trump was a performer, the media ably assisted him in his job. Even hostile papers like the above example were assisting him, giving him free publicity, opening the door a little wider for him to go through.The media seemed to be ambivalent about Hillary Clinton because, although she was a liberal and they were liberals, they didn’t want to spend 8 years looking at an ever-aging grandma. Lookism at work. Trump is pleasant enough to look at, and can be entertaining. That beats grandmaism.In the future, look for more Trumps to come out of the woodwork, especially from blunt breeding-grounds like New York City. It’s only a matter of time.

            Of the three legitimate (to voters) Republican gubernatorial candidates, two had their ballot petitions thrown out when state election officials miraculously gained the ability to spot “forged” signatures, and right before the primary the leading and best candidate was dawn-raided by the feds for some Jan 6 crap.

        I think it’s important to keep in mind that the indignities we see are only the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the surface is a great trail of humiliations and sellouts, willingly undertaken, in order to just get to the stage of visibility.Over the past decade, whenever I view an actor in an entertainment product I eventually ask myself, “What did that person have to do to get there?” After all, for every actress or actor on the screen, there are a thousand others, equally attractive or talented, who vied for the same role (and mind you, both qualifications have been in decline for a long time). In such a marketplace, why is any individual given the coveted role?Obviously, it’s what they were willing to give in return. Actresses submitting to the casting couch goes without saying; but doubtless most actors, too, have a record of intimacy with a certain circumcised organ.Since 2015, it’s been clear to me that the same is true of American politicians. They too are merely cast for the roles they play, and must be willing to put out in order for the party and donor endorsement. For the older generation perhaps the humiliation had a more financial aspect; for the younger, it’s almost certainly more lurid. (The Rubio or AOC jokes write themselves.)I take this as a matter of faith now: that if a pol is on TV, getting attention, in office— he/she is bought and paid for. Maybe a change is coming, but that’s how it is now. In Hollywood and the media (I forgot to mention them), this will be the norm forever.

            This person is new to me. SE is a whole new Cupp size. (doong!)From her Wiki: (not including her ballet is evil because I had an eating disorder bit)“In 2000, Cupp graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in art history. While attending Cornell, she worked for The Cornell Daily Sun. In 2010, she earned a Master of Arts degree from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University with a concentration in religious studies.[6]”This is a great quote: For over twenty years, Cupp has been an atheist, but has consistently stated that she is open to theism,[24][25][26] and once said in an interview with C-SPAN, “I really aspire to be a person of faith some day.”Her husband is Head of Communications for The Weather Channel. Talk about a clown show. A channel that reports the weather: a) shouldn’t need any public facing persona – just post the weather as text and graphics b) needs a Communications department?Good Lord Almighty! Oh wait, I am not ready for that yet. Maybe on my death bed I will find religion.

        Lots of great comments here, Mr. Z attracts some great ones.  One thought that I have had, inspired by the writings of Robert Heinlein, is that we should limit the voting franchise to people with a demonstrated stake in society’s future. Examples include restricting voting to property owners, married couples with children, military veterans or even those who can pass a critical thinking test.  The details are less significant than the principle of participation in politics being an earned privilege.Also, the Uke bots are after you Mr. Z just because of your name since the Moscow Rus uses Z as a logo.

                Monarchy doesnt need a justification, it worked effectively for thousands of years.  Democracy is an occasional aberration that spectacularly flames out in rapid fashion (as its currently doing).
Even in “democracy” the choices usually tend to be between the last guys wife and the last guys son or brother or nephew etc… really showing how deep the republican impulse goes.

                Heinlein wrote copiously about “earned” suffrage in his books, especially memorable, Starship Troopers.  Indeed, the recruiting posters for the military encouraged joining and “earning citizenship”. Monarchy to my knowledge was not mentioned as an alternative or better solution.  All folks were welcome to take a shot at earning “citizenship”.  Most people were content not to earn such right, and they made up the bulk of the population in Heinlein’s world.We’ve mentioned such here as well.  The situation for the last 100+ years has been to expand the franchise, as in everybody has an equal stake, an equal say, or an equal ability to understand issues and make good decisions concerning society.  Of course, most here would deny that “reality”.

        Wow! Everyone’s comments today provide some great laughs. Very good pillories of our clown world. Well done everyone. (That Crenshaw clip looks like it is fully staged.)A few episodes ago I posted that the Republican party was going to be more femmy and BIPOC than the Dems. I had that on a 5-10 year timeline. I was wrong. It is already here. I donated a bit of money to DiSantis a while back and am just hammered with emails and bot calls from Con Inc. In the last 4 days I have gotten messages from them like:– An email from the Republican’s historic youngest ever woman elected to Congress from NH if we just give her enough money. It went on to inspire me with comparisons with AOC and how she could be even younger than AOC was when she was elected.– An email from Daily wIsRaEL with a hunking black guy special ops warrior leading a group of white guy special ops warriors. I didn’t bother to read it.– Emails from multiple emergent black conservatives begging for campaign contributions – their platform seems to be they are hated by the left for being black and conservative. This is the new grift – it has morphed from handout seeking poor black guy shunned by society to suited up, handout seeking poor black “conservative” shunned by The Left.– Emails from multiple emergent Hispanic Women(TM) who are going to fight against The Left and destroy the country they came here (probably illegally), to enjoy.It is already here. The Republican party is more Democrat than the Diverse and Inclusive Democrat party of the Leftist’s most pitched diverse fever dreams.How many votes will these guys procure from the Dem Diversity Political Machine? None. They will just obtain the votes of now replaced heritage Americans.In more clown news, the Chip act web site is a good one to look at. It seems the biggest part of that Act (pun intended), is a photo op for hoody wearing black youth posing as scientists and doctors operating state of the art equipment while a forlorn white girl operates a soldering iron and a couple of white women fill out spread sheets. I didn’t realize that the ranking congressman on science and technology is a black female former RN. On the site it also lauds that we are fighting climate change. No mention of semi conductors – much mention of fighting climate change. Not a single Asian in the literature nor a single white man.It is almost as if China wrote this legislation and gave it to the Black and Green caucus to promote.Well, while others are posing in photo shoots and role play race swapping let’s get smarter and better and make our kids smarter and better too. Someone needs to design and build the next gen clown cars and equipment used to present it. This is a great time to turn off the TV and bury ourselves in skill development for building the future.

        Those who have read the patristic theologians and works such as the Apostolic Constitutions will know that in the Early Church, actors were forbidden membership in Christian assemblies.
Actors were specified in writing. They were forbidden both instruction and baptism. They were not allowed to convert without first abandoning their theatrical lives totally and permanently.
And this proscription was rigidly enforced.

            I stayed at the Lizzie Borden bed and breakfast a few times. Our tour guide told us that actors were considered to be the lowest of the low in those days. They had it right the first time.

                I am not so sure. If Lincoln had lived, given his stated goal to reserve all of the West specifically for our people and what consumed a lot of his time after the war, Liberia would have had a higher population that would be their problem not ours. It is something I think about from time to time.

                    Could have done the same without 600k dead americans… and for all the criticism the constitution gets without its early teen angst amendments it wouldnt be half bad.  Jaffa was in that sense right, Lincon was responsible for a second founding on principles that Jaffa’s tribe was very amenable to.

                    I somehow doubt a single African would have been repatriated.  The Emancipation Proclamation was a big hint that the goal was actually to flood the South with freed slaves who would vote Republican.  Nowhere does it mention that “freeing” the slaves was a precursor to expelling them from the country.

Except that his greatest performance was not acting. AND he brought to vivid life the old theatrical saw “Break a leg!”
So, yeah, I’m with you.

            Probably because it is the same tired playbook that started with Sarah Palin- present yourself as a rootin’ tootin’ tough mama from the West with a pistol strapped to your hip. Bonus points when you do a sexy pose on a horse, or at the range with an AR. Basically, it is the white woman equivalent of the Black Conservative the Vichy Right loves so much, along with the Wounded Warrior, that they hire from central casting.Plus, you should never trust a woman with a stripper name.

                Yep. There are the bad tell-tales for Lake. However, many of us are converts too, and she could be legit. Of all of the new gen Cons, she is by far the best at putting the media in its place – ironically enough.
Maybe it is best if the strong men are in the background for a bit longer. Then when the financial storms wash ashore, the men step forward. We’ll see if she is legit or if she is there to neuter other folks who are on our side are emergent.

                    What choice did one have wrt Lake?  Her primary opponent was a billionaire Republican machine candidate who bombarded the media day and night touting her credentials, which were *none*, just the endorsement of the machine left behind by McCain.McCain and Flake ran the show here for years and personally hand picked candidates for election in this State.  McCain was the deciding vote to *keep* Obama Care—that after repeatedly voting for repeal when Obama was vetoing all such laws.  That’s the old guard.They ran Martha McSally against Sinema, then they had her appointed to replace McCain after she lost to Sinema.  That’s why we have two Dem Senators.There is a revolt going on in AZ.  A split between the old guard, neocon, Repub’s and the new Trumpians.  Lake is a professed Trumpian.  You don’t trust her.  Why trust any pol these day’s?  But the mood is to ignore/reject pol’s with an elected record and go with someone not in the belly of the beast.

                    When in the losing position you take the allies you have and adjust as necessary.  Purity spiraling is one of the deep practical weaknesses of the right (although like most others it probably comes from a good impulse).The left has space for rapist muslims, man hating feminists, woman hating men in dresses, white hating mulattos, black hating mestizos, and a dozen more clown cars filled with natural enemies…  they all get under one tent and they all agree to take your country away first and then maybe kill each other later at their leisureThey know how to build coalitions and this is how they win.

                        It works for the enemy as it is destructive, so the type of destruction does not matter. They all work towards the same nihilism outcome in their way.The building and maintaining requires a narrow tent as it must pull in the same direction.The issue is not purity, it is the RINO issue of fake or controlled representatives that take up the space that could be occupied by real ones and run out another 4 years before anyone notices.You don’t think the repeated historical pattern of co-opting and inserting their own players into orgs is not being done for this current movement?A sudden promotion in the media for a person that was part of the main enemy of the population for 20 years seems extremely suspicious to me.Actors act, it is what they do on camera.

                Agreed. She is the only pol who not just supports questioning the election, her counter-attacks on journalists who attack her on it are very poised yet vicious. She could be a great ally. I remember where I came from and where I am now. She is a force. If we push potential friends away with purity spiraling we’ll forever be alone at the margins. Let’s see.

        Speaking of people with no dignity, Ace of Spades is reporting a rumor that Fatty Williamson is leaving National Review for the Dispatch to join Jonah Goldberg and David French.  This has to be a financial move, and he was already getting grossly overpaid at NR.  Across the political spectrum, among both candidates and pundits, I keep asking, who is paying to put these people in influential positions?

            There is a Persian underwriting the Dispatch and The Bulwark. I am pretty sure the Wilkes Brothers paid Sloppy Williamson for his anti-Trump screeds back in 2016. It was obviously a pen-for-hire deal. I would not be shocked to learn that they are now paying the Trotskyites too. There’s Koch money in there too. Of course, the MIC throws money at these guys.

                The curious thing is not who is paying for these “influencers” but who could they possiblt be influencing?  I’ve never met the actual receptive audience for any of it.  Boomer cons hate these people and no one younger has even heard of them except as the butt of jokes (david french anyone).
If theyre not intended to actually influence anyone, what function are they paid to perform?

They are there to occupy the space in the media landscape an opposition would.
By doing this  they control both sides and always get fed the correct lines in the script for the next step forwards.

        Maybe he didn’t start out as a celebrity but this Fetterman character running for PA senate is a another level of idiocracy.

                All of these actors and actresses were chosen to play the roles they are playing in this artificial unnatural surrealistic soap opera.
And they were chosen precisely because of the nature of their personalities.
It’s all scripted, and all controlled by Central Casting.

                    People really underestimate how much a stroke wipes people out, even small ones.  You’re never going to be the same person again, no matter how good your recovery was.  Add this to the fact these guys weren’t that bright to begin with, the extra 10-20 point drop in IQ is going to put you at having difficulty with simple tasks.

                    This is a good example of the difference between Democrat primary voters and republican primary voters. Democrat primary voters are the far-left and they want the good narrative. Give them the good narrative and they will never question it. Fetterman kitted himself out as a working man, learned how to talk like a working man and adopted the working man message that is in the mythologies of the Left. That is why they never bothered to look beyond the narrative.Republican primary voters tend to be the mostly moderate middle-class types who care more about bread and butter issues like taxes, but want a soft message. Middle-class white people have been conditioned to never offend the Left on the “moral issues” so they go for what they are told is the electable option. There are exceptions, but this usually occurs in states where the Democrats run the system or when there is no electable moderate option.

They are a distraction for the endless news cycle and a giant wall of retard you can never get over to actually get anything done. The goal is to infuriate and exhaust people at the same time.
Meanwhile the real players keep on steering the ship as they see fit.

                It’s possible that the more multi-cultural a society becomes, the more such clownish behavior of public figures is a feature of civic life.  It allows different ethnic groups to take pot shots at one another and mitigates any one group – ethnic or otherwise – feeling especially humiliated.Of course, our society has been none-to-subtly encouraged to debase ourselves as the morality of postmodern age has supplanted the morality of the prior culture.  Anglo-dominant Heritage America and Europe valued decorum (see the lavish praise for Elizabeth II) but the new movers and shakers have tagged decorum as oppressive and opprobrious. Taking pride and care in one’s appearance and behavior is old-fashioned, nationalistic even, but taking care not to step on the toes of novel identity groups is the currency of the new realm.

                With respect, Dr Oz didn’t need to end up as a clown. At the risk of doxxing myself, maybe you will trust me that I ran across his path in school. That’s the bigger tragedy. Our system now takes people who could have been serious men and encourages them to be clowns (e.g. Oz) or turns them into clowns (e.g. Ted Cruz). Of course, they are responsible for their individual actions. But at a systemic level, it’s a failure.

It’s prostitution is what it is.
I suppose that at least theoretically there could be such a person as a dignified whore, but Dr Oz and Ted Cruz don’t rise to that level, theoretical though it be.

                I’m actually not surprised.  Just look at the retards amongst us.  The next time you’re out and about, take a few minutes to look around and observe.For instance, I’m in a car dealership waiting room and I see two retards wearing paper masks.  There are probably 50 people in the room with customers and staff and no one is wearing a mask.  Yet these people believe that a paper diaper is “keeping them safe”.  The level of stupid has proven too much for me to handle at this point.This is why we have people like fetterman getting elected.  This is why allowing retards to “vote” will never work in a healthy society.

                    The number of young and in some cases not so young women voting this year because “Republicans want to take away your birth control” will be significant.  In 2012, Obama tended to avoid even local news media in swing states and instead did interview with the local hip hop radio station in order to help his get out the vote operation.  This certainly helped him edge out Romney in states like Ohio.

                        Fake news. Women want to make their own moral decisions like they want low SES suitors. Every woman short of the “I wanted to get pregnant just so I could have an abortion and feel it die” kind breathed a sigh of relief at the men finally taking back a “choice” she never wanted to have in the first place.

It’s a courtesy to those around you that you wear one when you have a cold or flu, but still need to go out and do things. Nowadays though, I just assume they are idiots who think wearing a mask will make them immortal.

                        No.  Masks are a dehumanizing tool that have no effect on the general spread of respiratory viruses.  They pit people against each other, thus distracting from the real cause at hand.
From Substack, German Covid contrarian Eugyppius had a good piece on Tuesday,Masks Are Not A Small Thing.  If any of Z’s commenters think they’re the only ones who feel a disgust and hate when they see the masked, you can rest assured you’re not alone.

            Oh, Strokey was playing the role long before he hit the national stage. He was a minor celebrity in Pittsburgh, playing the Yinzer to rapturous applause by the local media outlets, who never failed to showcase the then mayor of Braddock at every opportunity as a true working class hero.That was the audition, and it led to Strokey being chosen as Lt. Governor in Tom Wolf’s Administration of Misfit Toys, who also gave the country the gift of Admiral Dick Levine.

Nailed it as far as appearance–that’s spot-on, but stealing is hard work for a dude like Strokey.
Pennsylvania is a state that is a total enigma. It elects people who piss on them gleefully (“clinging to their guns..”). Then again, this seems to be a White trait.

                        Pennsylvania makes more sense, politically, when you understand that the Democrat city machines of Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh control the state’s politics. The lack of talent in the Pennsylvania Republican Party, even before it morphed into the Vichy Party, was and is a problem. Pittsburgh and Allegheny County have voted solidly Democrat since 1933, and that 90 years of electoral dominance has ensured no young, ambitious, or talented politician in Western Pennsylvania has ever joined the Republican Party, as it is a dead end. Why play for the political equivalent of the Pittsburgh Pirates when the only way to make it to The Show is through the Democratic Party?That talent drain means there is no populist politician from the rural counties of Pennsylvania who can literally come out of Penn’s Woods and represent the Dirt People. Hence, conservative Pennsylvanians get Dick Thornburgh, Tom Ridge, Pat Toomey…Vichy to the core.Pennsylvania is not an enigma if you think about it as an occupied territory, ruled by three city states in the east, center and west. The Whiskey Rebels were right.

                        @PR:
Given the United States as a whole is an occupied country now, that explanation at a state level makes perfect sense. Thanks. I still cannot wrap my head around folks voting for people who hate them, but I never conflated politics with religion like leftists do and the situation you described puts the Left and their enablers in the cat bird’s seat.

                    I’d never seen him before and someone on Fedi linked to a video I was like “cool, they got this guy who does roofing when he’s not strung out on pot to introduce the gubernatorial candidate…..why is he still talking and not introducing the candidate?”

                “That was the audition, and it led to Strokey being chosen as Lt. Governor in Tom Wolf’s Administration of Misfit Toys, who also gave the country the gift of Admiral Dick Levine.”
STOP, okay?
Just … don’t
It’s cruel and unusual.
Well, cruel, anyway.
Now I’ll have that mental image in my head all day.

That’s called “diversity and inclusion.”

        It’s always amusing to see the people who take the moniker of a clown, and don’t have the self-awareness to realize they are a clown.  Another example is Crenshaw’s schtick.  He really believes himself to be this tough guy veteran who says things how they are, and consistently makes of fool of himself.  The contrast is pretty stark when you have a person who is fully aware he is playing the clown, and still comes across more serious than the person he is mocking.It won’t be long before someone says point blank to his face that he wishes the IED finished him off, to riotous applause.Exhibit A:  Alex Stein and Crenshaw, part deuxhttps://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX/status/1570214602482544641

            My first thought upon reading today’s essay was Stein’s work exposing these goofballs, particularly Eyepatch McCain.  Alex isn’t likely on our side of the great divide but he’s doing a great job humiliating people who are very much our enemies, so kudos to him.  His technique of accusing them of their nastiest misdeeds while simultaneously laughing in their face and giving them no chance to catch their breath and respond is really effective.  In just the last few weeks he’s got both AOC and Eyepatch McCain to completely lose their cool.  One of these days he’s going score a really big hit when he causes some carny or other to have a public meltdown.

                The fact Crenshaw thought it would redound to his benefit to post this clip speaks volumes. Eyepatch McCain apparently hasn’t gotten the memo that even conservatards are sick of the armed forces. We’ve lived to see Our Holy Military, led by Uncle Lloyd and Miss Milley, as loathed and despised as the rest of Clown World. Praise God.
