        It’s interesting watching the local St Louis mainstream media talk about the defeat of Corey Bush last night, they were openly talking about AIPAC and Jewish money on television.The Jewish lobby of the past was more discreet in their power shenanigans the new face of Jewish power does not seem to care if people notice.Well people are noticing, not good for the Jewish lobby as we go forward.Which is actually not bad for the United States.

                Speaking of All-Time Great User Names, has anyone heard from Whiskey recently?
I searched the archives, and this all I got for 2024:“The Year Of The Fink”January 29, 2024https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=31484#comment-388218
In the remainder of the Z archives, the only other instance of the word “Whiskey” is from an old PJ O’Rourke saying:https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=32392#comment-415774
Other than that, I’m not seeing anything else spelled “W-H-I-S-K-E-Y”.
I simply have to assume now that Barnea or Netanyahu must have called him up for some sort of Mossad or IDF duty.
I hope Whiskey’s still alive.

                    pretty sure it’s only been a week or 2 since he posted
since he tends to post late in the day, it has a tendency to get buried by the new format, except for those of us who sort by new

                    I hope so too. It was always good to set your pessimism clock using his posts. I seldom agreed with him that things were quitethatbad and hopeless though.

                    This blog is an organism.
I’m very glad that Zman has allowed upvotes, but downvotes are even more valuable (Read. The. Room. + Reality check)
Whiskey is a bit feisty.
I like that.

                That’s great.
One of the Alt Right types once posted a Twitter meme with Stars of David superimposed on applicable CNN talent, and the network’s furious reaction to it was hilarious. CNN took to doxing Alt Right Twitter users immediately thereafter. The network had been deeply troubled for a long time (I’ve seen speculation it is financially propped up by the intelligence services), but that episode certainly didn’t help.
As an aside, many including me from time to time have knocked the Alt Right, but there is absolutely no denying it had a major effect and changed the conversation positively.

            They were wise to replace her, (what a face, btw. Wow!), with a house negro. We can see the path forward for them. The pogrom of white men will continue. Now there will be a pogrom of black women who do not toe the line. There are no shortage of pets who will take the money and play ball. Look for Bell to be on a plane to kiss the wall and make any and all necessary shows of fealty in short order.Nonetheless, these kinds of maneuvers only lead to creating more and more enemies. Worse, it makes enemies of the people who are the most rabid, ideological and ethno-centric.Our people in England look like they have finally decided the pot is coming to too hot of a boil. England has crossed the line into formally/officially announcing itself as an anti-White police state whose primary purpose is to obliterate the indigenous and only English people.The working class are leaderless and they need some leaders. Who among them will be the first to take a stand and make things explicit. I suspect as ZMan has alluded to, it will be the first powerful person who has his daughter or son viciously stabbed and murdered and then visited by the secret police and offered a package in exchange for a public call for healing and reconciliation.History is sometimes determined by timing. While I don’t wish that as the catalyzing event, I pray that whatever form it takes, it comes soon. Pray for our people of England. They are in great need, as are we.

                Both Hank Johnson (GA) and the late Sheila Jackson Lee (TX) are examples of house Negroes used by the GOP to replace nettlesome blacks in the House. Johnson took out Cynthia McKinney, long a target of AIPAC. Jackson Lee was used by the GOP to get rid of Rep. Craig Washington, a Barbara Jordan-type Democrat in Houston who wasn’t willing to spend all of his time giving money to NASA.

                    Cynthia McKinney is an interesting character and actually quite bright for her kind along with the usual black BS. Her post-defeat rhetoric was turned up to 11 even though the propaganda organs tried to squelch it. From memory, she had choice words for Uncle Hank and the rest of the coloreds of people shucking and jiving for ol’ Marse Schlomo.Rep. Thomas Massie, a detestable guy in many ways but rock solid in a few that count, survived AIPAC’s attack on him and now lobs a few that land. Take note that while not many did, some outlets still amplified his revelation to Tucker Carlson that Members of Congress have AIPAC handlers. Also note that this was not denied or acknowledged at all.

                        Yes indeed. McKinney is quite bright andsui generis. Or at least, she seems to have some kind of family resemblance to 60s black radicals like Carmichael or others, who, for all of their revolutionary insanity, could sometimes espy the real power when sober (not only whitey).

Last night, at /pol/, I saw an outstanding new nickname for our vice president:

If any of you have teenaged kids who work the innert00bz furiously [TXTs, dik-dok, insta-ho, etc] tell them [and all of their friends] to start referring to our vice president as “Kumswalla”.
e.g.: “Hey, did you see Kumswalla last night on the Rachel Maddow show? Total shag carpet scene, bro. Yeesh!!!”

                Finally realizing that they hate us and want us dead and that the ballot box is a farce.  This exact scenario is headed here.  Who will have the courage to give up comforts to make the sacrifice?

                    Hi TC –Good to see you back. I want to give you something to think about. It is about how men and leaders comport themselves. This is a very serious situation for us.It is existentialas you know.That requires us to cultivate our masculinity and to consider our disposition, our words, our posture at all times. Even this blog could be where more come to this side. Will they find uplift, confidence, properly expressed alarm mixed with the proper resolve and right plans and courses of action? Or, will they find affirmation and confirmation of despair?It is up to us to both be alarming and to critique and at the same time to show the path forward. Posture, disposition and outlook are contagious. Leaders know this and comport themselves accordingly.The battle and the war is not lost. It is only just getting started. It is up to us to see that the path through that will be our victory is there. We have within our means and amongst ourselves what we need to get there. We just have to see that. If one sportsballer comes here and finds uplift and company and leaves behind ten on the couch that is one more who has joined us and found that this is much better company. Maybe he’ll take 2 more off of the couch and they will hunt and fish. Maybe he won’t. But at least he and they won’t see us as whiners and losers.Stay resolute my friend. Even posts on a forum can tilt the balance. Things are only now getting interesting.We are going to win.

                    The newer minorities to America view the whites as a privileged elite, living off unearned proceeds. They see their situation as being similar to that of the underdog. In their viewpoint, everything they do is fair as it equalizes a tilted playing field which is anything but level. Cornered by life, confused by their choices and not a little frazzled, the minorities will lash out …— G.N. (www.dark.sport.blog)

                “Pray for our people of England. They are in great need, as are we.”Yes. And despite what some of the Anglophobes in these parts will say, there are still loads of good English who hate what their government is doing to them. Like in America, they haven’t had much of a voice for many, many years now. It’s partly, but not only, a class thing. Many of the people involved in the unrest are working class, but there are also many exceptions, with some middle-class types speaking out against the regime.  The two-tier policing, along with the rampant crime, is so blatant that I think more people are willing to go out on a limb, even though the costs can be terrible, as with the January 6 political prisoners.From some excellent recent discussions at Lotuseaters:Carl Benjamin: a “feeling of losing the safety of England, which is really at the very bottom of all this”Beau Dade: “people are scared for their children, it’s as simple as that.”Carl Benjamin: “And also it’s going to intensify because you’re attacking the people who have a legitimate grievance.”Harry Robinson: “Nobody believes in regime legitimacy anymore.”

                    From what I’ve seen, they are mad at the wrong people.  Diversity acting diverse is not the problem.  The cops following orders is not the problem.
The problem is the satanic managerial elite who keeps hostile foreigners in the country and making police do 2 tier policing.  Their ire needs to be directed at them, not the diverse and cops.  I’m certainly not excusing diversity’s diverse behavior or the order following cops. It’s easy to see why the actual British people are mad at them.  But they are a symptom and not the cause.

                        “The satanic managerial elite” is certainly the heart of the problem. But that satanic group uses the Diverse as their foot soldiers, along with Antifa and groups like Hope Not Hate. Just in the last few weeks before the murder of the little girls, the amount of crime committed by the Diverse was astounding.You can bet that Starmer is running scared, trying to wrap as much security around him and his minions as possible. As Dade pointed out, Westminster is already surrounded by physical security barriers. Much of the unrest is occurring in northern England. Places that were once Labour strongholds and which have been especially “enriched” by the newcomers. People are lashing out against the immediate threats. Getting to the elite will take more time.The English have been backed into a corner to a degree that some Americans who have done “white flight” can’t quite understand. When your own life and your children’s lives are under everyday threat from these migrants and their children, and you’re not allowed to talk about the problem, there’s not much else you can do.

                            I’m not excusing what they are doing.  They can be dealt with after the root cause is fixed.  They ALL need to be deported.  ALL of the “Caribbean” Africans and regular Africans, ALL of the Indians and first and foremost, ALL of the Pakis.But these diverse people are not the problem. They’re just acting diverse.  It’s what they are.  That’s why they must go. They are not British, they never will be British.  Hell, I, an American who has never even been to the UK am far more British than they will ever be.  I have multiple English ancestors.  if I married a brit and reproduced with her, my children would be more or less indistinguishable from other Brits. To the extent I have other ancestry, it’s all NW European.

                                I’m not sure what else the English people can do at this point to act against that root cause which you describe, short of an outright, violent revolution. Probably most people in Britain who aren’t Woke are very hesitant to go that route, understandably. These riots and protests have been, I think, mostly organic and rudderless. You’re right that they might not get at the root of the problem, but I think these people participating in them see no other way at present. Did you see the footage of Starmer delivering flowers on behalf of the murdered little girls, with locals heckling him? It was actually a very polite heckling as these things go, but very much to the point.  Those people are not the clients of Starmer and the Left. The Diverse are their clients.The people who are the root cause which you describe are tucked away in their metropolitan flats and offices, or “working” from home in their trendy neighborhoods. Not so easy to get at them.The British working class voted Labour for many years, which supposedly represented their interests. As Britain slid further under mass migration, attacks on its history, Trans, BLM/Antifa and all other aspects of Woke, the working class tried voting for the Tories in 2019. That didn’t help either. As I stated elsewhere, Labour is now openly revealed as a violent enemy of the working class. The Tories weren’t quite as overt, but they’re pretty much part of a Uniparty.

                                    It sounds like the UK is experiencing the same political upheaval that happened in the US from about 1970-1990. The traditional “working class” party was revealed to care more about degenerates and darkies than the working man. At the same time, the patrician “old-money” party (GOP or Tory) successfully wooed the working class vote. Eventually, the patricians finked on the workers as everyone with any sense knew they would. The result was a Uniparty working exclusively for rich oligarchs and multinational corporations.In accord with the general acceleration of everything though, the whole process in the UK seems to have been running at eight-fold speed and the workers can now see themselves facing the same kind of Uniparty we have.It’s almost like someone is trying to tell the White working class in all countries that they should work together against their elites.

                        That “symptom” murdered three white girls. There needs to be a massive pogrom against the wogs to send a message to those who survive and to those considering invading our lands. If the Power Structure won’t staunch the flow of savages into our lands, it’s up to us to do the job ourselves, the nasty way.

                            9 or 10 children were stabbed, and 2 women.
Many more mass and violent street marches (riots)by the diverseattacking cars, people, pubs, with weapons, firebombs, breakage as whites were forced to flee or hide than the Southport “far-right racists”.
Police either did not appear, or actually ran in these instances.If the wogs get ticked, a vibrant riot mob marches on the council hall or police station. Violence is the solution.As Apex says, fear and pain is the only thing that teaches.

                                Didn’t the “officeress” attack the guy trying to defend the children and the then the murderer attacked the cop attacking the guy?  Or was this a different incident (there’s so many to keep track of)?
I agree and posted as much here on past occasions.  They have to fear either the law or the people.  But the law has been weaponized and the Satanic elite simply do not fear ever being charged for anything.

                                    I believe you are thinking of a different attack – might even have been in Germany? – where a migrant attacked someone, a native intervened, the cop went after the native, then the migrant knifed the cop.  Karma as they say.

                        And the English white working class doesn’t like these projects of mass immigration, trashing the history of the UK, Trans, etc. They voted for the Tories in 2019, hoping that the Tories would listen to their concerns. The Tories didn’t, and now the Labour Party shows that it’s an outright enemy of the working class.
As someone wrote in a recent book, people like Starmer in Labour and many of the Tory leaders are “anywheres,” with no allegiance to a nation. The working class are “somewheres,” with allegiance to their local communities and the nation.

            Money primarily works to establish name recognition in politics.  It doesn’t move public opinion that much.  Bush, like all members of The squad was embarrassingly incompetent.  By all appearances, enough urban white liberals have come to realize they should have required a baseline standard of competency when electing these pets to Congress to swing races against Bowman and Bush.

                        “Money, blackmail and intimidation works.”Recall that Kemp in Georgia, solidifying the great steal, observed his daughter’s boyfriend’s (the son of a former GA governor) murdered in a massive car bomb. The lesson was for learned by many. The lead state investigator turns up dead 2 weeks later. The state investigation dies, and of course there was never any federal investigation. Terrorism ignored and unpunished is terrorism that will happen again and again.These barbarian monsters have been murdering for a long time. Some of the attempts fail, but a failed attempt still has an intimidation effect. The great industrialist Henry Ford who ran the Dearborn Independent was run off the road but survived. People who get in the way turn up dead like Admiral Forrestal and General Patton.

            think i have the fix.  lets move jews from israel toHamtramck, Michigan. the Arabs in the u.s. can move to Israel.  less dead people and much less expensive.  the war stops the protests stop, its a win, win.  not sure what to do about the temple mount.  maybe just drop a bunker buster moab and nobody gets anything.  oh wait, will the muslim just make every attempt to create unrest for the removal of free civil society?  islam groundwork seen worldwide, to make the region unlivable for anyone but islam.  yeah, maybe better to keep the war outside u.s. lol.  coming to a neighborhood near you.

            Their religion is based on a negative identity. “You’re persecuting me!” You will note that early Christianity was based on this theme, as well. And that’s because the early Christians were primarily Jewish.

                The early Christians were doused in oil and set alight as human torches. The early Christians were thrown into the arena to be torn to pieces by lions, tigers, and other wild creatures. The early Christians were crucified, drowned in barrels, tossed from high places, skinned alive. Many of these early Christians watched these things carried out on their dearest wives, children, and friends before suffering the same grisly fate themselves.Equating this with the persecution complex of the dreadlocks gang is a non-starter. Their religion is based on belief in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and they were willing to suffer death and torture to remain steadfast in that belief. It is difficult for me to see how one arrives at the conclusion that the Christian faith is also a global pity party.

                    Nonsense. There are no credible sources for 90% of this persecution stuff. Read J. B. Bury’s histories of the period. Until Diocletian came along, Christians were largely ignored. But when Christians finally came to power in the 4th century, they cruelly persecuted pagans relentlessly.
On the other hand, millions of Christians were destroyed by the Jewish Bolsheviks, Genrikh Yagoda foremost among the killers.

                        The early Christians would tell you otherwise. The New Testament documents some of the earliestpersecution. It appears that people who don’t want to accept a history that involves Christians being victims from day 1 discredit perfectly solid sources by objective measures. That I have to go find a specific author that will do editing of history for us is no great remark on the history presented.Also, please look up Julian the Apostate. The pagans did come back to form and did plenty of persecuting on their own (again!.) He also encouraged Jews to rebuild the Temple.

                There is nothing about early Christianity that was a pity party. The New Testament, a majority of it open letters by Paul, is the exact opposite. “I consider these sufferings nothing..”

                That ending is a bit confusing, since the First were dissidents against the Sanhedrin system…the very connivers that Rome had made rich beyond dreams.
The first statement (true) seems to clash with the second.But, on the other hand, their identity came from being dissidents.

            Exactly. Jews have never wanted to just fit in. It’s not in their nature. OTOH, they hate, hate, hate to be called out. The worst thing that you can call a Jew is “Jew.” It’s not because they are ashamed but because it exposes them.
The worst thing that you can do to a Jew (outside of killing him) is ignoring him. As a pure middle-man people, they can’t exist without others.

                And it’s been damned hard to ignore Jews for the past fifty years or so.  However, lately they’ve become far more cacophonous, both here and abroad – and more are starting to open their eyes and ears and take notice.  Hopefully something significant will come of it, like removing them from all positions of power and influence in the west – though I’m not holding my breath…

He was only pursuing what he perceived to be in his “best interests” as well.This idea that life is just a sort of meaningless struggle, and that might (or Satanic cunning and the corruption of all Truth and Beauty) makes right (and is only sensible, really), is the rationale of every actor and agent the majority of the commentariat here opposes.Idoblame those who have perpetrated this upon a people whose biggest vulnerability was their nobility of soul and intention.

                                I don’t know if that’s the same situation. Protestant whites let them in the front door. They did all that despite what the history books say, so they have themselves to blame. I happen to think Northern European Protestantism is culturally superior in most respects to Catholicism (both Roman and Orthodox, of which I am one), but this is not one of the areas in which they excel. A little bit of tribalism and paranoia from whites would have served everybody much better.

Jews mostly, although WASPs were part of it. Poor whites quite often were in almost the same situation as African slaves.  Again, Mr. Eastern European you can find a country that is to your liking with all the smart people in it. You don’t need to bother with us plebs.

                            That’s the puzzle, though. The entire Bible is a political tract chronicling how they got us to fall for it again and again.
We kept subliminating our history and identity to their distorted version. The runner-ups kept claiming they were first place, and still we believe.
Why? How? Thousands of years of this shit, and still we fall for it every. single. time. after incalcuable damage to us.We try to turn it around and wham! it just bites us in the assagain.

        Israel’s death spiral is likely to last many years. Israel will slowly be absorbed by its surrounding population of semitic peoples who have been in the region since before there was air. The Brooklyn Jews and other obstreperous cohorts will bail first, especially any Jews holding dual passports. The process has already started. Look for the collapse of Israel’s economy to be the harbinger of things to come. All the Iranians need do is keep up the constant pressure without resorting to all-out war. Nature will do the rest.

                It’s not emigration quite yet, but there have been several instances of late where the planes leaving Tel Aviv before air traffic was shut down due to military conflict were packed to the rafters with dual passport holders. Israelis would not have done this at such scale even a few years back. Poisoning the well and importing hostile Muslims to mau-mau European peoples may have not been worth the sadistic rush, eh?

Problem is internal as always.  The ruling elite must maintain an image to their people.  Too many (unanswered) “insults” and the people turn against their leadership.  It’s a dilemma.

                They are forcing Iran to go nuclear.  They don’t want to build a bomb and say it is anti-Islamic in their view, but a bomb is really the only way they are ever going to leave Iran alone.  They likely believe, perhaps correctly that if they get a bomb, other non-Shiite Muslim states who don’t like them will also pursue bombs.

            That collapse may be quicker than you expect. Their economy is in shambles with no end in sight and their best, most productive people are leaving or called up for torture duty. The absolute worst of them are still exempt and produce nothing of any value. Israel’s only hope economically is to become another Ukraine, totally depending on the West for everything. That isn’t sustainable for them or the West.

More generally nukes are just a tricky conundrum. They are too dangerous for everyone and their mother to have. And they can’t be uninvented. But that gives the lie to all countries being principally equal. And it is dangerous to build complicated schemes on lies

                            Very tricky, yes.
Oh, well, bio-weapons will soon make nukes moot. They’re easier to build, much cheaper and much, much easier to hide.

                        That’s a new one:  America is obligated to pay for the defense of the rest of the world or they will build nuclear weapons.
And what makes America more sane than all the other countries?
If I recall the line of argument correctly, “If Ukraine had nuclear weapons Russia would not have invaded”.
Seems to me if Lithuania, Sweden and Finland had nukes, Uncle Sugar could go home and mind his own affairs, that badly need attending to.

I don’t recall the exact phrasing, but it was along the lines of “if there’s no Russia, there’s no reason for the world to exist.”

                                            Felix, Putin has stated more than once what Russia’s position is on first use of nukes.  I saw him speaking on a video and the policy seemed reasonable.
Simply put, first use possible if invasion of Russian soil, or imminent danger of nuclear strike on Russian soil.  All other options require response to nuke strike—other’s first use.
That does not sound unreasonable.

                                                    Certainly, and that may have initiated a first strike if Ukraine threatened such, probably long before such was installed.  Or Putin might simply have not invaded or kept the war level to non-nuke first strike to take out those weapons as he did to the Ukrainian Air Force.There seems to be an assumption/fear that war cannot be limited if parties have nukes, but this seems not the case in Ukraine.  The quickest/easiest way to end the war would have been a total shutdown of Ukraine’s electrical grid, but even that was not attempted until two years in.  There has been great restrain shown in the conduct of the war.In any event nukes—even tactical—are a pretty poor weapon to use except to eradicate large population centers and that suites no-one’s interest in these type of conflicts.

                                            As I stated downstream, the potential of a mistake or a madman isn’t so great as to justify the BFE’s hegemony and all the misery it entails. There is a risk in anything. In this case, the latter is riskier than the former.As to Putin, he’s not a madman. World leaders make loud and unsettling noises constantly. It doesn’t mean they’re sincere. And I simply can’t imagine Putin running the risk of Moscow disappearing under a mushroom cloud just to make sure NATO didn’t take over the Ukraine. Attacking a non-nuclear Ukraine was risky enough, and victory there hasn’t been easy to attain. Doing so against a nuclear Ukraine just wouldn’t have been in the cards.

But he won’t always be president of Russia.And I simply can’t imagine Putin running the risk of Moscow disappearing under a mushroom cloud just to make sure NATO didn’t take over the Ukraine.Remember, this whole alt.hist.discussion is predicated on the notion that Uncle Sam picks up his toys and goes home, leaving everybody to fend for himself. If it could be done with impunity, Russia would save itself a lot of grief and money if they just glassed Western Ukraine.And listening to Polish warmongering should give anyone pause about the idea of nuclear proliferation – Poland already started one world war and they hate Russia with the fury of a thousand suns.And not without reason, either.

                                                    When both sides have nukes, Krull, there is no guarantee of impugnity. Quite the opposite. Rather difficult to mask a flock of ICBM tailfires.
And I don’t doubt the Poles hate the Rooskiis enough to launch nukes against them. But they don’t hate them enough to commit suicide in the process, which is exactly what they’d be doing by launching a nuclear strike against a vastly superior Russian nuclear counterforce.

(I was reviewing an exchange at Simplicius by a guy who had spend years digging into the state of our nuclear readiness.  Visits to sites, interviews, wading thru documentation, etc.Our “insta-launch” readiness is hair-raising, and no, it doesn’t depend on that 2 to 6 minute window of the nuclear football.)

                                        Alzaebo.  Lots of folk talk, but know little.  Believe nothing from unnamed sources.  Our nuke deterrence was always designed and anticipated to survive a first strike, thereby solving the dilemma of ”use them or lose them”.As to leadership knocked out by a decapitating strike, that is planned for as well.  As I wrote a while back we have two SAC generals in the air 24/7 who will control the whole show if Washington “lights up” someday.Albeit, our deterrence is aging, Obama signed a bill to inject $1T into updating our nukes—aside from national defense budget.  The triad of deterrence, land, sea, air may not be as it once was, but the Ohio class sub’s remain pretty solid and the Trident 2 MIRV missiles of just *one* sub (we have 12) can wipe out all of Russia.Now I have no inside knowledge, but I do remember a story of Bush II asking how many nukes we had upon briefing and he was told 15k+.  Reportedly Bush was shocked.  Well, we don’t keep these things (if they work) stacked in a nice pile.  I suspect we’d have lots of that crap remaining after any first strike.There is no need to launch on warning, never was and it currently does not exist, except in the fevored minds of those who wish to make some coin on FUD.

Nothing, but you already have nukes so we’ll just have to take our chances. Lithuania? Poland? Estonia? There’s no need to take that chance, as long as you pony up.
And it’s not new either, it’s how NATO has always worked: if you want to call the tune, you have to pay the piper.

                                NATO “worked” when it was a core of important countries confronting the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.
Now its a collection of inconsequential little countries telling the USA to use it’s money and nukes to defend them while they poke at the bear.  Nuts to that.  Get your own damn nukes with your own money.
We’ve got our own existential problems: Uncontrolled invasion by the third world and thirty trillion dollars of debt.

                                    NATO worked until Bill Clinton, with the Kosovo War, transformed it into an instrument of US imperialism and ripped up the UN charter in the process.
And it goes without saying that I’d love Denmark to have a few dozen nukes instead of buying F-35s.
But only as long as Sweden didn’t have any.

                                                Making jokes about nuking Sweden is as Danish as rødgrød med fløde.I spoke to an Australian expat who had worked in Stockholm back in the early eighties, and he’d been having dinner with his colleagues when the subject of a Swedish nuclear weapons programme came up.“But”, the Aussie protested, “who would you nuke?”No hesitation: “Copenhagen”, they replied as one. So much for Russia…Just for the record, I love Sweden to bits. I’ve visited upward of fifty times on both business and pleasure and I just have to cross the bridge to Sweden to be back in the enchanted fairy land I roamed as a boy scout.

Think on that next time you wonder why all these Mickey Mouse-nations in Eastern Europe – who share no language and only have hostile history to look back on – can’t just grow the fuck up and get the fuck along.It’s all good and well to look at a map and figure out how a peaceful world, with buffer zones here, spheres of influence there and client states over there would work, as long as you’re not the client state that has to knuckle under for the sake of world peace.For 500 years, Poland has been used for a football in a three-way soccer match between Russia, Prussia and Austria, so their grievances are very real. Real enough for a nuclear war? I dunno, but supposedly rational actors still started two world wars for extremely silly reasons, so I’m not too keen to test it.

                                                I’m well aware of Europe’s history of bloody internecine conflict, Felix. But all of that occurred in a world without nukes. These weapons are qualitatively different and completely alter the moral calculus of war–at least when the oppo has them, too. At any rate, were I a Euro it’s a risk I’d be willing to take if it meant that the BFE’s pestiferous meathooks were no longer dug into my flesh.

                        Sorry, pal. All those “moral obligations” seem to lead to more and more violence and chaos around the world, especially in countries too weak to defend themselves against the US Godzilla. Not to mention corruption, bankruptcy, and decline here at home. Let the Europeans and everybody else around the world figure things out for themselves. Stop being lapdogs for the US and find some dignity.

            A good chance they try. Striking Moscow could activate the Russian dead man automated system and thrust the entire world into a large exchange that would kill most of us. Russia very well may assign two of its best subs to tail Israeli dolphin class. The dolphin replacement class set to roll out in a few years have installed vertical launch tubes in case there was any doubt the turbo popeyes might not make it to Moscow.
No single person on a sub can initiate a nuclear conflict, not even the British enable this despite their rhetoric.

                    I say it’s brinkmanship, a massive bluff as they always do, and that the Sampson option is a WMD fraud with no receipts.
The real Sampson option is to get the enemies to kill each other.US/EU, Ukraini vs Rus, Muslim vs Euro, Persia, China, etc.
If Shapiro is the new Sec State, he’s Blinken II.Blinken’s military shadow lobbying firm, WestExec, hired April Haines and Psaki and the like to ‘influence’ the revolving door, putting such creatures in the perfect spots to light the spark.

        “The Israel lobby is proudlyinterveningin American elections, because it fears support is faltering.”The intervention is in broad daylight — they’re not shy or coy about it. They have most US politicians by the balls. In contrast, the Chinese and Russians, who don’t interfere in US politics, are incessantly accused of interference.The Israel lobby in the USA is funded by Jewish plutocrats. Jews are the richest — and by implication, in a venal country like the USA — the most powerful minority in the country. And to a large extent these plutocrats march in lockstep.Israel was started by the terrorists of the Stern and Irgun gangs. Terrorism is in the DNA of Israel.

            That’s one thing that I’ve learned over the past few years. The organized Jewish community doesn’t act like a lobby, it acts like an extremely loyal ethnic mob. Their tactics go far, far beyond simple lobbying. They’ll use blackmail and intimidation, including physical, along with bribery to get their way.
Until some other group fights back with similar tactic, the Jews will run the show.

                Good observation.  With just what we currently know—not stuff classified as top secret—Israel has treated the USA arguably *worse* than the USSR did in the days of the Cold War.  With friends like that, who needs enemies?

                Of course they ‘interfere’ and engage in the usual bribery and blackmail. I mean it’s DC. I’m shocked, shocked I tell you, to see @#$%ing going on in this planet’s largest whorehouse. But we’re talking an order of magnitude less interference than that of the Tribe.One of the interesting things about the Chinese and the Japanese (not that they really matter these days) is that they can look at the Tribe without our historical, cultural, and religious baggage. They know what’s going on and see it with clear eyes. They don’t talk about it in public because East Asians don’t sperg out when they (ahem) Notice. They’re much more adept at keeping mouths shut and just getting on with dealing with facts and reality whilst playing along with the charades.The Chinese get most of what they need through straight out industrial espionage and the insane refusal of Boobus Managericus Americanus to grok that blood is thicker than water and that citizenship papers and a security clearance do not a Chinaman erase. Americans also have this dumbass notion that a Taiwanese Passport means said yellow fellow won’t spy for the PRC. This comes of knowing less than zero about Taiwan and its complicated society, a supposed ally. Chinese are on Easy Street provided they don’t cross the Tribe or let the Tribe use them as a distraction from Levantine atrocities.

        Since the wars of the 1960’s and 1970’s, the narrative has been that Israel is this plucky democracy fighting for its existence in the midst of savage not-democracies.
Hmm, I wonder what other false narratives they have pushed?

        “The Israelis, the Zionist and their supporters in the West will claim that there can be no peace as long as Hamas exists”Actually, in the “American” Thinker, the “National” Review, the “American” Spectator, and their other cousins, the claim is frequently made that there can be no peace as long as Islam exists. This correlates with constant braggadocio about the enormous power of the US military to carry out exterminationist crusades against Muslim states, usually by “glassing” them or “making them glow”. “If we did it to Germany and Japan…”I’ve lately come to realize this to be projection, what Israel would do if they could. They are in a tough spot, it’s getting worse, they are right to be afraid and Israel destructively lashing out is certainly in the realm of possibility.But then, replay the three minute standing ovation in Congress greeting Netanyahu like some sort of conqueror entering the hall. Not just clapping. Yelling. Screaming. Tears. Hundreds of American legislators on their feet. I think they were all afraid to be the first one to stop clapping. Under these conditions, America destructively lashing out is not out of the question.

        For me, Israel fatigue began almost twenty years ago. Even then, it was clear that they had a vast network of official and off-the-books figures upon whom they could call to make sure the Big Players of the world gave them support.Many of these Israel activists were (and are), as we know, even alledged citizens in the Big Player countries.In any case, I see any support for these entities as fundamentally evil. It strikes me a bizarre today that, a person will vehemently side with some country/people just because various figures from ‘media’ told them.If you can’t see it, and you weren’t there; best to keep your beak out. Of course, there could be clever political reasons for picking a side, but some GoodWhites really do seem tocare.

        Whatever happens, remember thot, Israel has nukes, its neighbors do not.
The idea that God is the ultimate real estate dealer seems ridiculous, but a huge number of US Christians with their Scofield Bibles can’t get enough of it.
in one way Israel is truly biblical: how they’re waging this war. Kill the women and children with double taps, bomb the schools and homes, rape the men in handcuffs and laugh about it when caught.
(Palestinians aren’t saints either. But with the Lancet estimating almost 200,000 dead Palestinians to Israel’s 1,000 in October, it just looks like barbarism. )

                Iran knows it can absorb a few minor hits from Israel.  They can just let the Israelis continue to piss off their few remaining friends.  A counter attack does them no good compared to the damage Israel is inflicting on itself.Proof?  The last Iranian “counter attack” was a feckless few missiles launched hours in advance with plenty of warning which inflicted minimal damage.Russia is doing the same in Ukraine.  Absorb the small hits, let the US, Europe, and Ukraine burn through resources and wreck their economies, and grind down the Ukrainians until they’re no longer a problem.  Or their government collapses and the new one sues for peace.Here at home, the public ain’t having it.  Even my evangelical sister is lukewarm on Israel, and her support is mainly for Netanyahu, not “Israel” per se.  That is a tidal wave of change in just one person.  And that sentiment is nationwide.However, our problem at home remains that the “solution” to problems in the Middle East was to invite them all to live here.  I was at the airport the other day, which is a good reminder that “diversity” has led us straight into a police state.The vibrancy brigades will not stop at Israel, and we are all in their hit list, too.

                Isn’t Lancet one of the journals that published a fake study claiming HCQ is dangerous and should be banned from COVID protocols?  They left it up *just long enough* for the FDA to ban it.  Then they admitted it was bogus and took it down AFTER the FDA sentenced people to death by ventilator.
Heck, I’m old enough to remember the phony “massacre of Jenin” all those years ago.  Completely fraudulent.  The Israelis have way overreacted, but reports of Gaza casualties are probably similarly overstated.

                    You have it rightly, I think. For those interested, just google “Lancetgate” and let your fingers do the walking. I think it’s also called the Surgisphere scandal. A complete fraud from the get-go. It was such an egregious fraud that even “establishment” medical folk voiced objections. The paper was retracted in a matter of weeks. The incident is believed to have permanently damagedLancetreputation. (The above from memory, so may not be 100% accurate.)Relevant to the comments about Gaza deaths: My first question would be what on Earth is a prestigious medical journal doing publishing papers that don’t have the least relevance to the medical system, public health, research, etc.The major medical journals have been “bought” long ago and are largely captive to the hive mind that is the medical-industrial complex. I guess it’s no surprise, then, that Progressive editors will wander into the tall grass of political activism. I’m sure they publish stories about “climate change” too.

                        If the Harris marketing blitz demonstrates anything, it’s that there is no platform that will be spared from the Left’s eyeball onslaught.Fortunately, there’s a knee in the curve where marketing starts to have the opposite effect.  Bad products are the most overhyped products.  Humans intuitively know this, even if they can’t explain it.its like that horrid chick-based Ghostbusters movie.  The more it was hyped, and the higher the “official” reviews, the worse things got for it.  People got quickly sick of it, and after a few days people got to judge for themselves.  The film quickly cratered.Anyway, not surprising that Leftists have infected Lancet.  No public forum will ever be permitted to exist free from the Agenda.

                Isn’t it curious that Lancet hasn’t published similar “studies” on the “real” number of Ukrainian or Russian dead. The war has only been going on for 2 and a half years

            No need for prayer. Jesus said it best (John 8:44)…
“Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”
Seems pretty clear to me.

        [U]unconditional support for Israel is now limited to old white conservatives, primarily located in the Bible belt. Everyone else ranges from Israel fatigue to outright hostility to Israel.
I’m an old white conservative, though a continent away from the bible belt. Never supported Israel, unconditionally or otherwise. Long since passed through Israel fatigue, outright hostility after the Liberty attack and prefer not to state my present position.

        I have been surprised at the lack of moderation among the Zionists that I know.
Nuke Russia, nuke Iran, nuke Lebanon, remove every single Palestinian from their land, etc. Anyone who isn’t fanatically pro-Israel is an enemy and must be killed. Any kind of suggestion, like maybe Israel should hold back on indiscriminate bombing of civilians, is immediately met with ridicule and self victimization.
Pretty dangerous mindset, the obvious answer is to not give them any weapons, money, or power. I have no love for Arabs and Muslims, but the Zionists are legitimately crazy and dangerous people.

        Look at what the Houthi have done to the mighty USN and that is the harbinger of what is to come. Jews are in command of the MSM (propaganda manipulation), DC politicians, abounding wealth, and the international banking system (Rothchilds). And yet, Hamas guerillas routinely pop out of holes in the ground and blow up IDF armored vehicles with seeming ease using homemade weapons. Netanyahu and his ilk are building bunkers for a reason. Mano a mano. May the best man win.

        History teaches that entangling alliances with small, belligerent states always lead Great Powers into big trouble. Athens had money and naval power too and still lost. The UK backed the Serbs; they never really recovered. We’re repeating this in Ukraine, Israel.The amazing thing is that our Jewish friends couldn’t accept being a powerful, prosperous minority here. They resented the hegemony of the WASPs. So they have pushed mass immigration and globalization in order to dislodge the WASPs and establish their hegemony. Meanwhile, all the brown types they’ve let in will be their undoing in the long run. It’s just hubris. They are very smart, but they have outsmarted themselves.

            I don’t buy this narrative that they are such super smart people. They take education and mental training seriously, that is their edge. It’s like an athlete. You may have God given talent, but if you don’t practice and train, you don’t make the most of it. The Jews make the most of their brains.

        At the same time there’s increasing hostility for Jews in Israel, it’s also increasing in the West. Maybe it wasn’t such a bad idea in 1965 to leave the demographics alone, since so many Whites love Jews and Israel, and the imported Muslims hate them. An example that high IQ isn’t everything, since that was a major blunder.

                    I don’t know. Most of the Catholics I know are very zioskeptical. I don’t know too many who are part of what Pat Buchanan called the “amen chorus of the Republican Party.” They’re not loved by us as some sort of special pet proto-Christian like Protestants love them.

                        No, we don’t collect for Israel, but that doesn’t make us immune to the philosemetic culture we’re living in. It’s not “I don’t know”. My example is from my own regular attendance at Mass. I’ve had very difficult discussions on Jewish issues in person with Catholics. Even been banned a Catholic once for absolutely insisting that Jesus was not a Jew. Wholly blaming American Protestants because you can and board like this sucks it up is not correct.

                    Mostly the first half of X in my experience, mostly for lack of anything better, and mostly half-heartedly. Hence the black-pilling they’ve long been known for, I’d guess.
I mean, at least boomers got to spend some time without the degenerate soul-sucking, and at least Millennials got to talk to each other on the internet. It’s really strange how powerful media and mass culture are, when you think about it.

        Regarding the lecture you linked, I wonder sometimes what would happen in an alternate dimension where a man like John Mearsheimer advised out foreign policy instead of the lunatics we have now. There would still be wars and conflicts, as these will never leave us, but at least we wouldn’t constantly have the feeling the train is out of control, and at a certain point we are going to run out of tracks.

            We are currently being run by the characters inEntourage. Worse yet, I wonder if TPTB think of themselves as being in a movie, and this “movie” is giving their lives meaning and perverse thrills, in the absence of a Higher Power.
I even think some of these people want the world to end. They know, probably more than we do, how F-ed we all are. That they are damned because they have brought this upon us, and that we are damned because we have let them. Maybe they’re right, in a way.

        Did Ariel Sharon’s stroke doom Israel?  He was a hardcore military guy who eventually realized the Israel couldn’t fight it’s way out of their problems so he jumped started the peace process.15 years ago Israel might have got a sustainable deal.  Those bridges are all burned and time is very much not on their side.Iran clearly doesn’t want war right now because they’re getting stronger relative to Israel by the day.  A few years of peace while in BRICS and allowed with China and Russia and they’ll be untouchable by Israel. Which is exactly why Netanyahu is trying so hard to provoke them.

        Israel has been the chief parasite on the USA since Truman, against the unanimous recommendation of the State Dept, decided to recognize them..Reportedly, a suitcase with 2 million in cash had something to do with that…It’s been expensive…at least 2 trillion in US money..and as Dean Acheson predicted, has damaged the American relationships with many countries in the ME…But at this point, the US will have to say no..An attack on Iran would be disastrous, and the Pentagon knows that…and sending more trillions to our parasite-in-chief is not going to happen….Meanwhile, many Israelis have left the country, its economy is collapsing, and the pathetic IDF has manpower issues, like the Ukraine….One day, Bibi will go too far, and China will squash him like a bug…

        The GAE can’t even fight a good propaganda war anymore. There’s no 21st century version of Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin saving the chosen ones from the intifadists. If you want zionism to continue, you have to make it cool with the younger set. They were successful doing so with my generation, but somebody in Hollywood subsequently dropped the ball. A place run by chosen ones, go figure. Crisis of competency perhaps. Maybe they thought history had ended and the agitprop was no longer necessary. There was Spielberg’s List, but implicit in the black and white production was that it was an affair and concern of the distant past. Now the cool kids are all intifada sympathizers. Because Hollywood told them to love the brown people and hate the white. And the pink hair prof taught them about decolonization.

        So this means the tail is done wagging the dog?I’ve had it up to my shit brown eyeballs with “the plight of the poor, down trodden jews, and Israel.”Fact of the matter is Israel is and always has been the regional bully. The only reason they could pull that off is U.S. military might and money.Israel is like the little wimpy, loud mouthed sycophant the bully always has hanging around, and the U.S. is of course the bully. Like the little punk in the leather jacket and green eyes in the movie Christmas story.This time around a lot more is at stake than a pissing match between Israel and their arab neighbors. Things are so geo politically unstable, Israel vs Iran could set off WWIII.Thanks to U.S. aggression against Russia “Ukraine.” Israel is the U.S. proxy, Iran the Russian proxy with China as a silent partner.The irony of WWIII “the apocalypse” being set off in the middle east. How very biblical.

        The internet helped inform people, especially younger ones, about the Israeli problem, but there are still a lot of people who have muscle memory from decades of pro-Israel brainwashing. The Christian Zionists are the worst. These people don’t even seem human, and act like a cult. There is absolutely no way to get into their thick skulls.
Unfortunately a lot of people, and I see this with non-whites, could care less about bigger things happening in the world. They are content with eating and reproducting and unless they are Muslim, don’t care about things in the Middle East.

        It would be brilliant if Iran keeps talking about an impending attack on Israel then… does nothing.  I suppose Netanyahu will poke them again and again to get the right reaction.

Now they are like no harm, no foul dude, just the tip, when they show their true barbaric religion selves. Like you’re a punk, cuck, idiot, whatever. It is so over the line. AND they can’t admit when they are in the wrong! Like yes, we are trying to kill anyone who even dares to try to feed the Palestinians, yes, we will blow them the fuck up.

        “Project Israel cannot exist in peace, so it must seek war.”No objections to today’s commentary, but I’ve been seeing of late a somewhat different take on the Israeli situation that I believe directly relates to our present situation in the USA.  Israel is a country of people and (religious) culture that was planted within another country of different people and (religious) culture.  (Yes, there were Jews in Palestine forever.) To me, it’s an “oil and water” type of situation.  In short, race/culture/religion mixing and all the problems that stem from such.One must win, one lose—and be eradicated.  It’s simply coming to a head now with the growing strength of the Arab world and the decline of GAE.  The war in Gaza is nothing less than a final attempt to remove another people and culture different from the new controlling people and culture.Seems we have the same situation in the USA with the demographic decline of our traditional “White” culture of the founding stock.  I suspect Israel is a precursor to what will/may happen within our country in a generation or two as our new minorities rise and struggle for dominance and our predominant “White” culture shrinks to powerlessness and future eradication becomes all too apparent. Violence seems on the horizon if separation is not offered as a solution—and that too seems reminiscent of the Palestinians predicament in Israel.

        We’ve forgotten that 10/7 interrupted a color revolution in Israel. The International Jew™ was a few days away from establishing an American-style globohomo state there, the permanent victory of Tel Aviv over Trump Heights. It was the last chance for the European Ashkenazim before demography swamps them. They wanted Israel’s “diversity” ruled like America’s: tasked toAnglo-steinregime ends (sterilizing kids, etc). They lost. Hamas’s small victory that day, whatever its provenance, turned Israel into a regionally normal military state—representative of its increasingly regionally normal people.OurIsrael problem remains, of course, but in principle we got a win. Israel is Israeli.

If they are not in my own nation taking up space and stirring up trouble, I have no animus against them any more than I’d have against any random person overseas whom I’d never met. Of course, the fact that I don’t avidly take the side of the Tribe means I must be an Anti-Semite®The second is the observation that the Jews bill themselves the chosen people, favored of God. They are the group destined to rule over the nations. At least, that’s a claim I often read. Their historic behavior certainly supports such an arrogant self-image.The third is that Islam, of which I admittedly don’t know much about, is by turns claimed to advocate killing all the Jews. Certainly that’d be a valid charge against more radical elements. Sadly, bloodshed is an ancient feature of that part of the world. Yet, on the other hand, it’s often claimed by boosters that Islam is a religion of peace. Notwithstanding (say) Hamas’s misbehavior since October 2023, to the best of my knowledge, it’s a fact that Jews and Christians as minority populations lived relatively peaceably in Muslim dominated lands for many centuries. If that’s true, it’d tend to lend support to the assertion that on the whole Muslims were not a bloodthirsty religion intent on wiping out other religions.

            The peacefulness was due to being a tiny minority in an Islamic majority country.  The structure was closer to master and slave as the Christians and Jews had no political power, but rather paid for the privilege of living in such countries.  One might note that such a situation worked in this country until after WWII when the White population became insane and adopted the policy/creed of “equality” among races.

                Jews had a great deal more power and privilege  than Christians did under Islamic rule. They kept their traditional money making occupations, which made paying the state off with their “foriegner” tax easy. It was 3 tiered system, with Jews comfortably near the top.That’s why Jews and Muslims tend to work together against Christians.

        “What all of this tells us is that Israel is in deep trouble. … It has evolved to the point where Project Israel cannot exist in peace, so it must seek war.”
I used to listen to Dave Ramsey. I always found it interesting how people would call in with their financial problems and Dave always had some biblical passage to apply to their financial situation. It amazes me that the same wisdom is still applicable today.
I’m wondering if all this stuff about the end times is another example of biblical wisdom.

        “The assassination of the Gaza leader in Tehran, on its face, is an unjustified act of war.”The jews have been assassinating one Iranian general after the other without consequences, why now would the leader of a small foreign state provoke them to act? The fact is jews took control of Iran post WWII (like they did throughout the west), and is secretly working with the Israelis to destroy the Persians. This conflict goes back millennia, and it’s part of the jews psychopathic makeup, to hold grudges however.Watch the jews continue to murder Iranian officials with impunity. Jews control Iran. Fact.

            The one huge unnoticed fact, even though it’s casually mentioned as if it doesn’t mean anything:
There are 35,000 jews in Iran.I imagine some of those lineages have been there for a very, very long time.
Iran was known as Persia until 1935.It is a true nation, not some lines on a map drawn by foreign powers.Where the Roman Empire ended, the Persian Empire began.
I see now the how and why of British-Indian agent Khomeini brought to power as a foreign puppet, courtesy of MI6 and CIA.

        This article, by all current definitions of anti-semetism promoted by semites, very anti-semetic. Which is the problem with analyzing anything jews are involved in. The evolving hate that is anti-semetism always becomes a counter to whatever conclusion the analysis comes to. Which is actually a very good reason in itself to be anti-semetic.

        Z:  denouncing Israel is all covered, go back and parse what’s important to you, and then what you actually know:America.You know America.  You probably know Baltimore best.  America is important to you, not Israel.And Foggy Bottom agrees with you on the destruction of Israel, in fact has all along.Foggy Bottom also wants your destruction, very much, what has happened the last 10 months put FB in a dilemma and fortuitously for Heritage Americans they couldn’t do both and became paralyzed.This does not mean Israel is our friend, nations and foreigners don’t have friends.It has so far been useful to Heritage Americans.   The alliance is decades past its shelf life, like NATO, and should end November 7th.  And Will.And your view Sir would change if you had been to the muddled East, or I daresay read history of the region, at least the history before you were born and conscious of the world.   Still that’s what most of us know…. Stay on the main thing, America.The alliances all expire in November, so relax.
