        Infiltrate and destroy. IMO guerrilla tactics are needed, groups need to quietly get together on local basis and try to find ways to bring it down from within the other side. Lots of ways of doing this. Project Veritas is doing a good job of showing their weakness, opening their big mouths to anyone and everyone as they are bleeding hearts, find ways of using it against them. Maybe some can get in deep enough and they expose election scandals, or sabotage it, burn them with it. It may be hard to get in if your past voting shows R next to it for the past 3 elections. Find others that can do it. Teamwork. I dread the thought of becoming what I despise but unfortunately they have thrown out the rules and basically declared war and winning at all costs. I think some on the other side that voted for your not black Joe see what they have enabled but those at the top will cheat that much more next time as I think some will think twice about whom they vote for.

        Voting is the act of inflicting the violence of the state upon your neighbor.  It is the immoral low road.  The day that war is viewed as murder and taxation is viewed as theft is the day that America has seen a sea change in its thinking.

        TPTB know full well that once the populace sees voting as futile what replaces the ballot box will be the cartridge box. This is where it leads. This is why they are freaking out.It was this lie – that voting works for the people. That kept the ruling elite in power and population passive while they were being gutted like a trout. Once folks see that voting for some interchangeable scumbag in DC doesn’t help them at all but in fact harms them. They will turn on the elites and political class in a very ugly manner.Even Tucker sees this,that the cartridge box comes after the ballot box.

            Anarcho tyranny is the end game.
Anarchy paves the way for tyranny. The Chicago mayor firing cops over masking mandates means fewer cops which means more crime which means more tyranny. Federal law enforcement, federal tyranny. The lawlessness will reach a point where Chicagoans will demand that the government do something to make it stop, then they will have full on tyranny curfews and Marshall law.

                “Anarchy paves the way for tyranny.”
No it doesn’t.  Anarchy leads to the removal of politics from the public sphere.  In removing said politics, you remove the parasites that infest the social fabric and you remove the violence of government.
Only one thing leads to tyranny and that is more and more government: the polar opposite of anarchy.  At this point, anarchy would be a massive improvement.

                        Anarchy is not chaos.  The terms have been indistinctly mingled for decades in pop culture but anarchy is nothing more than the removal of government from your life.
What occurs in its absence could be chaos or could be order.  That depends on the society and people.  Chicago may in fact end up being chaotic with a tyrannical government, the polar opposite of anarchy.
On the other hand remove government from some places with a population of civil and self sufficient people basically nothing will really change on daily basis.

        This is great timing.  We received three mail in ballots last week.  I threw mine in the trash.  My wife asked if I had already voted, and I said “No, I threw it in the trash.  Elections are fraudulent.”She threw hers away.  My son looked at me, said, “Well, technically I live out of state (college) anyway,” and discarded his.I’ve said for going on 10 years that the GOP must be destroyed.  The best way to accomplish this is for 80,000,000 Republicans to sit out an election or two.If Trump gets traction on an election boycott, he could very easily “suggest” a nationwide month long general strike.  It would destroy the economy and probably collapse the government, both of which are desperately needed.

        When a single party becomes hard-wired into a particular position, like the Democrats when they supported slavery, the other party in a 2 party system (the Whigs) rapidly figure out that all they have to do is make vague references to God and liberty and they would gleefully take the entire abolitionist Christian vote without having to make any serious promises of reform. They could get straight back to grifting after that. The 2 party system gets salami sliced into a single party system when one of the parties becomes absolutely captured.Dutiful, honorable, honest conservative Christians of course had no choice but to vote Whig even if they were the worthless neocons of their day only interested in grifting. What forced change is when Whig leaning conservatives stopped simply voting harder and started using the party as a source of social capital for anti-slavery violence, a way of forcing the issue when it was obvious that kicking back and voting wasn’t going to do anything. This was more than just fighting against slavery, but it was fighting for truth too, against the lie that voting in this context could accomplish anything.And it’s a delusion anyway to think that anyone who enslaves another person or kills her own child in the womb is going to participate in fair play honest elections with conservative Christians. It’s impossible to vote fairly against atrocities and the cheaters and psychopaths who perform them. And if were actually possible, it wouldn’t be just, because these villains deserve worse fates than losing elections and having to settle for mere upper middle class lobbying careers afterwards.We can only pray that people someday realize that it’s better to be ruled by those born into power, rather than those hungry for it. We want a king.

            Its an attempt to pretend that there is no censorship of these things in the news. Look we allow them to be said.
You must be cray to think you can’t say them. (He even says it in the segment) Are you going to believe the news or your lying eyes as the HR dept terminates you for saying men and women are different.
Given that they had accompanying graphics inserted in the segment, they either prepped the script beforehand or inserted after it was recorded in review. Its hardly accidental.

        Collapse is already happening in Chicago. Even if a bunch of cops do “comply” with mandates to check in with their vaccination status, there is nothing to prevent them from being “sick” or just standing around eating donuts. With Halloween coming up there is a very big possibility of gangs and unaffiliated criminals just taking over most of Chicago and even doing house-to-house looting of the suburbs. Why not?The Mayor wanted de-policing and now has it, good and hard. Which is likely the end-game. Most mayors want to purge all the normal people and have a city like Detroit or Baltimore. That is preferable: black gangs, homeless, and nothing else. No one to interfere with “total graft” of the block grants and other Fed transfers in exchange for fraudulent ballots at election time.

            Every day I hope for more chaos.  I’ve been wanting all of the police to be abolished in those left wing hellholes for a while now.  Nothing better than to see all of the leftists having their homes burned by the black orks.  It will take a full on collapse and destruction to even begin to have hope for a newly rebuilt nation, or should I say nation(s).

                Perhaps the logic is backward.  The places where you can carry a gun aren’t attractive to crime.  Everyone (well mostly) has a survival instinct, even leftists.  The cognitive dissonance here is the state worshippers with power know this and surround themselves with protection.  The blind followers believe the rainbows and unicorn lies spoon fed to them but deep down know they are vulnerable.  They are most hopelessly invested in the system.  Spewing the nonsense of defunding the police while simultaneously complaining when there’s no one to answer 9-1-1 calls.  At some point their lizard brain kicks in and even they have to know now is the time to have a way to protect yourself.

        Back Jan 2020, Whitney Webb wrote about the predictions that the 2020 elections would be so fouled up, that Americans would loose faith in elections and democracy.  Predictions that came from Israeli consulting firm Cybereason back at least to mid 2019..  Cybereason partners with Lockheed, DHS, FBI to probe weaknesses in election infrastructure.How Government and Media Are Prepping America for a Failed 2020 ElectionRussia, China and Iran are already being blamed for using tech to undermine the 2020 election.

        There’s a woman running a write-in campaign for the local school board. Lots of yard signs in the district saying Our kids, Our choice, and a good many signs for her campaign, too. I’d say she has a shot at it.Not just school board meetings, but all the local meetings are becoming active. People are engaging where they have the power to make a difference. You get a sense of desperation from it. It’s not the usual cranks and whiners.Last night I watched Infowars, and it too had a different feel. Even back in the Obama days, the calls had an ironic, almost resigned distance to them. “I know what’s going on but everybody thinks I’m crazy and I don’t know what to do.” Along those lines. Now it’s more like “We can’t go on like this, something will be done, what’s it going to be?” Again, engaged and desperate.I’d been pretty disengaged myself, only to check in and see this ray of light. It’s almost breaking through my cynicism, at least today. The spirit of it is different from, say, the Tea Party, which was genuinely angry, but within limits. This has a hint of all-bets-are-off.And frankly, that may be what Americans have been missing for longer than I’ve been alive. People might be ready to put down their amusements and investments and start assuming the responsibilities of a free people. Might. Almost as if they’re beginning to understand voting harder is a dead end.The pain is moving up the socio-economic ladder. It’s not just weirdos like me feeling disenfranchised anymore. Even ‘respectable’ people who wouldn’t normally make waves are getting their priorities straight, and that’s a huge positive.

                I’d argue the scam is that minding your business and voting in secret is good enough, especially in America.  Seems to me voting decides nothing but formalizes arrangements arrived at by other means.Our political culture developed under frontier conditions with a national government across an ocean. People had to figure out how to build and govern society on their own.(An interesting feature is that, despite Enlightenment rhetoric about governments being established to protect the people’s rights, the government isn’t expected to. The Constitution assumes government will act against the people’s interests if not constrained. Why that assumption I’m not sure.)How we got from having ownership in our society to being livestock on a glorified farm in such a short time is a question I can guess at but not answer. At any rate we weren’t always dispossessed.

        I’ve just been reading Ron Unz’s fresh look at the U.S.S. Liberty incident. If that piece doesn’t dispel any doubt about the nature of popular democracy, nothing will. We elect sociopaths to the highest office. Virtually everyone reading this accepts that Lyndon Johnson would be tried as a war criminal in a just world. Unz’s essay only reinforces that conclusion.

            When he testified in Congress with his cartoons of the “High Tech Caves of Tora Bora” that never existed did it for me. The surveillance tech available to the DoD a decade before that would have proved the fraud. He acted as a mouthpiece for the regime. Why he did it we’ll never know. But the decision to go to war against countries which never attacked the USA, and ignore the ones which did, has been disastrous for the country.

        Back in college, in one of the rec rooms of the student union Building, the DJs organized a vote for top 100 rock songs of all time, the results of which they would play in a countdown over the week. Each voter had to list his 10 best songs, and the results were compiled to see where songs ranked.One of the smarter DJs remarked to me that if everybody had the same #11 song, that song would not even figure in the top 100 even though it is technically the #11 song of all time according to the voters’ tastes.As far as election boycotts, a better thing to do than staying home, is going to the polls, and writing ‘stupid party’ next to one, ‘evil party’ next to rhe other, and ‘fuck em both’ on the bottom.

        Z-Man, my criticism would be related to your failure to extrapolate. The situation is not stable. First, the widespread fraud has the crazy left excited. Nancy, Chuck, Joe are all 80 or pushing  it. The Squad is young, has unlimited money from Iran and Soros and now Bill Gates Daughter, who married a Muslim.There is no reason at all they can’t manufacture unlimited votes in the primary for the craziest, leftist, most anti-White candidate in any district where they have favorable conditions: DAs unwilling to prosecute vote fraud and sympathetic poll workers. That’s it. Expect a hard left Congress composed mostly of Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressly (likely the next Speaker btw).Secondly, this is OUR opportunity. Remember how I said we should “fully utilize” our situation — we have lots of crazies, few organizers? The crazies should be pointed full tilt. If that’s the game, then anyone can play it. Bernie was only interested in buying a new house (which he did) and not out-phony balloting either Hillary! or mumbly Joe. Others want to be elected as they are much younger and in better health. Indeed imagine every Democrat being a crazy non-White like Ilhan Omar? That’s revolution by the leadership: corporate, military, etc. for self preservation. Our crazies can play a role there by helping to push on the open door.Look at Hollywood — White males even those with a certain background are out, its now all gays and blacks and trannies. At Netflix, Chappelle is getting cancelled as “engineer” (aka diversity hire tranny “Terra Fied”) has more power than Reed Hastings in that regard. That happened in just four years really as White women united with non-Whites and trannies to force out the big shots. As a result the all black, all gay, all tranny, all female Hollywood is a joke to all normal people — no is inspired or even likes the woke Star Wars, Star Trek, replacement female Indiana Jones. Hollywood now has zero emotional pull as a result. They make stuff, that appeals only to the woke on streaming platforms and sell that data to marketers. That’s the entire business model.People fundamentally are more risk averse (protecting against losses) than risk friendly (gambling for a gain). There is a reason gambling is regarded as a vice. Our job is to force the current leadership in the corporate, military, and other sectors into full on risk-aversion through naked self-interest out of fear. Even the wokest of woke leaders prefer being leaders than replaced by Terra Fied. As, if they are not leaders then they are literally nothing.Mail in ballots are a gift for us.

                Exactly. And the larger point is that once something is counterfeited, it will be done so over and over again until the object in question has no value. Currency, votes, works of art, etc. All once something has been counterfeited will be done so again. The crazy left is just aching to get into power, and get their dream utopia (by killing millions). You might even argue that the killing rather than the utopia is the point.Our crazies are not really doing much for us, why not make them useful? There is no probability that they could fake enough ballots to put say Richard Spenser in Congress, but they certainly could push on the open door to replace say Nancy Pelosi with oh, some lunatic SF street left crazy. THAT would kill the chicken to scare the monkey.Bill Gates and George Soros are fine with an eat-the-rich anti White movement, their money insulates them. But their managers, bought politicians, etc? Not so much. We need the Pelosis and Schumers and so on afraid not of us but their crazies so that they go back to at least the idea of Trump the Reformer better than winding up (if they are lucky) shoveling pig manure in their declining years like Xi’s father did.

        I’m not sure how long ago it was that I first started asking this question, but it was at LEAST 20 years ago:During the Cold War the Americans would make fun of communist elections with just one candidate, but here’s the thing: Is two candidates infinitely better than one candidate, or just one better?By now I think the answer is clear, and that is why I petitioned to be struck off the voting roll in my state.  I would de-registering is an even more powerful statement than just not voting.

            If they won’t take someone off the voter roll if they die, what makes you think they would take someone off who asks to (because they don’t want to vote anymore)?
By admitting to them you want out, all it means is that some college kid will now be assigned to vote D in your name as if you were dead.

            NoOneImportant:  A kindred spirit!  I did that about 2 years ago.  I still get endless gimme appeals from various candidates, to the point I called the state voting registry the past year to ensure my name had been removed.  I was assured that it had been done per my written request.  There doesn’t seem to be anything more I can do to get my name removed from various political organizations and conservative grifters – sending back their postage-paid gimme letters with pennies taped inside and variations on FOAD written on them hasn’t slowed them down.I am trying to disengage from the political and social and economic systems of clownworld as much as is reasonably possible for myself and my family.  This naturally entails various compromises and everyone must choose his own, but choosing not to endorse ‘the democratic process’ by active decision rather than presumed apathy was important to me.

        I have to say, it’s taken me a while to come around to this line of thinking.  But the way Z frames it – legitimizing the illegitimate – along with the ludicrousness of the recent presidential selection makes boycotting all future “elections” the only way to go – for starters.  Then the whole system needs to be brought down.

            To me it’s like this. The look of oldsters, with their shining eyes, all proud of wearing their “I Voted” stickers during the last national election … is as stupid as the idea of spending untold hours in front of a TV yelling about sportsball.Once you break from the spell, there is no going back. At least for me. I have boomer friends that made a lot of noise after the ’94 baseball strike, only to return one year later. Now, they “can’t live without muh baseball (name team)…”Reading about sportsball, $pending on childish gear, consuming it at all, a farce. Same with the former “silly season”, now I could care less. Any interest in sportsball ended prior to them embracing BLM, that was just the confirmation of a good decision.And look, voting has not changed a thing locally, let alone nationally. Why bother?

        What’s the best evidence for our elections being fraudulent?Of course, the biggest issues are the resistance to making voters show ID at all and resistance to clearing the voter rolls of ineligible voters.In 2020, the best intuitive evidence was that everyone went to bed on election night thinking that Trump was going to win and then we woke up and found that just enough votes showed up in just the right places for Biden.For me, two other videos:  The vote counters locked the witnesses out of the building and taped pizza boxes to the windows to conceal what they were doing and the water pipe break that caused the witnesses to be evacuated.Am I missing anything?Unfortunately, none these are a smoking gun…

No president saw his vote go up by double digits and lose reelection. In fact, there are no cases where an incumbent in any office won in a two man race, saw a double digit increase in his vote the next election, but lost. I’ve looked long and hard for an example and cannot find anything like this in any election. Whenever an incumbent loses, their vote total goes down, not up.

                More theoretical than factual, but the Power Structure attempted to overthrow Trump by every waking moment directly he was elected. Anybody really think they didn’t see the 2020 election as the final opportunity to accomplish what they sought all along but had failed to do? They saw the opportunity, and they took it.

                I was unsure about the 2020 election until I saw the shennanigans in the Californian election.  That made me realise that the process is hopelessly flawed at every level, with like-minded individuals and agencies working independently and without central coordination towards the same goal.The people who design the ballots and envelopes, mail workers, officials, counting machine companies and judges do not have to conspire.  They can all figure out what needs to be done to crush the kulaks.

                    Somewhere else on this thread, I think someone compared the 2020 election to a Walgreens in San Francisco.  There is no syndicate of shoplifters conspiring to rob them out of business.  Those people just instinctively recognize the new rules and act accordingly.  That lends credence to Z-Man’s theory that the fraud last year was the result of many, many politically motivated election administrators to each do their small part, independent of an overarching plan.

            I admit I got carried away on election night. Trump was clearly going to win Florida and way ahead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and PA. I knew they were going to steal it but I let myself forget about it at that moment.I went out to get a bag of chips to celebrate. When I got back, Arizona had just been called for team blue and the Jew on Fox news was gloating about it.WI, MI, and PA were not moving at all. When I woke up the next morning, WI was blue. MI kept getting closer that day until it flipped. PA was still red and I watched the 7 day process where more Dem votes just kept being added until they won. There was no mystery about the final outcome by then.PA was probably the most blatant steal. I believe Trump won PA by 8% or more. Anyways, the plan for whites is now extermination. This is what a Jew run society looks like aided by their moronic goodwhite lackeys

            Smoking gun. Yeah.
You have a friend whose girl goes for a nigh out with the gals – wine bar or some such. He says her location on her phone goes dark between 9 and 1. Weird. Happens twice, and he says he has suspicions but no smoking gun.
What do you tell him?

            “Am I missing anything?”Yes, the history of your own country (assuming you are American). Too much to list for an internet post — you can delve into the 1960 race, Joseph Kennedy machinations in Illinois. Or without investing the time to read any of the Caro LBJ bios, look into mass vote harvesting by the people backing a former school teacher named Lyndon. Or more recently, the Clinton woman and her visit to the rebbe during her years as a Senator.Buying votes, fixers and ward leaders gathering boxes of votes, all long before 2020. The most recent election theft, IMO, is just perfecting the game. The left is either better at cheating than the “right” or they are in cahoots. Pick your poison.

        The main point of an election boycott movement is to make Facebook and Twitter ban an election boycott movement.
A hallmark of third-world government is mandatory voting – see Brazil. Turkey, Ecuador, Peru’ etc. We will live to see mandatory voting here in the US, especially if there’s a boycott. This is why a boycott won’t work in the long run. But it’s exactly why we need to have a boycott in the short run – to make these jokers beclown themselves.

            Australia, which always has been a soft police state, mandates voting and aggressively fines those who do not participate. Given what has happened there during Covid, jail sentences may follow.I generally support what Z has suggested here and his analysis is correct. The exception would be where a particular candidate would force the system to again delegitimize itself as happened in ’20. Outside of Trump, I don’ think there is anyone viable to make them do this. And for the record, I will not be voting for Trump if he runs again unless I become convinced it would prompt an outright coup or something similarly overt would be done to invalidate the election. My guess is the cheating will continue under the table and take care of things in a more subtle manner.

                In Australia, we have to turn up at the polling station and get our names marked off but the ballot is secret.In case mandatory voting is introduced there, the traditional way of protesting is to vote informal: do not properly mark the ballot.Instead, cover it with rude pictures and words.  Very few actually do this though, because most people who don’t want to vote are indifferent, not based.  They just donkey vote (mark the boxes 1-4 from top to bottom).  Candidates used to be listed in alphabetical order but they had to change that rule to a random draw because people were changing their name to Aaron Aardvark to get on top.For the record, the fine for not voting is about US$15 and you’ll can go to jail if you don’t pay it.  Years ago, a newspaper investigated whether anyone had actually gone to jail for this and found a handful, but they were all people with chaotic lives who also had many other unpaid fines, not conscientious objectors.Compulsory voting has the main effect of hiding public apathy to the democratic process.If many people refused to vote or pay the fine, they’d probably just seize it from bank accounts.  We need to think a few steps ahead here.

        If voting was truly meaningful it wouldn’t be allowed. Notice that no vote was ever taken to legitimize the American revolution. Ballots weren’t cast to enable the Louisiana Purchase or the acquisition of Alaska and Hawaii. Wars are never declared by the casting of votes. Picking the optimum septuagenarian to lead what was once the most powerful country on earth by counting the ballots of those who’ve never met the guy is sensible procedure, however.

                When I was a kid in San Francisco, hippie-remnant meth bums on my street corner sold pins that said IF VOTING CHANGED ANYTHING THEY’D MAKE IT ILLEGAL. Jello Biafra wore one when he ran for mayor. I don’t know if we were neighbors.
I’ve seen approximately that quote attributed to Mark Twain, but all Mark Twain quotes are fake (said Mark Twain), except the ones credited to Frank Zappa, Andy Warhol, George Carlin, and Jello Biafra.

                So you delegiitimize voting.
And then what?
I am curious as the suggestion of legitimizing revolt as a behavior once people accept voting is voided in a system that demands obedience to every utterance at the muzzle of a police gun.
This seems to me to be only 1 option.

        The problem as I see it is not voting per se, but rather the dearth of our guys to vote for.  I will never vote for a conventional republican again to be sure.  On the other hand, here in Appalachia I could see one of our guys (a Jared Taylor type) winning a congressional seat. If clever and persuasive he could shift opinion more in our direction and maybe help his constituency. Certainly, an appalachain pol could effectively counter the white privilege canard.  We are in a full spectrum battle, and I favor the approach of fighting on all fronts, all the time. We have the potential numbers to pull this off.  So by all means get our guys in office.  Also become regionally ungovernable.  Disseminate propaganda.   Create parallel institutions.  For instance, a new version of the boy scouts that emphasizes martial and masculine virtues could be a big win.   Z councils withdrawing from the political sphere, but to do what?  I favor pushing on every front, hard and ruthlessly.

            Agreed with the post but not:“Certainly, an appalachain pol could effectively counter the white privilege canard.”
This is playing on the enemy’s terms. “Proving” that you don’t have “white privilege” is like trying to prove you’re not a racist. it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t exist, and it’s not about whatever “white privilege” or “racism” is anyways, it’s about pushing an anti-white narrative.

                I disagree.  Crawling thru your own ass to disprove that one is racist feeds into the narrative that racism (race realism, reality) is bad, the worst thing you can be. White privilege doesn’t have the same connotations. Z cautions against negative identity. Fine.  But we are in a dog fight here. I say, stoke white racial resentment.  Certainly, build upon, and trumpet, the vast achievements of our ancestors.  Do both.  The globalists/élites have purposely and systematically targeted my people for addiction, hopelessness, and death.  I find myself angry with them.https://t.me/Gobucs1030

            “Create parallel institutions. For instance, a new version of the boy scouts that emphasizes martial and masculine virtues could be a big win.”But, but, that’s like Hitler plotting to do Hitler things! (Thanks for the laugh Z.)Back in the day I was an envirotard (believed in AGW, etc.) and after the hanging chad fiasco which kept our Gorey savior out of the big house I vowed never to vote in another presidential election.  And didn’t until Trump came along. 2020 was an even bigger sh*tshow so I have no problem boycotting the next election or writing in Krusty the Clown on the ballot (or Let’s Go Brandon! if there’s enough room). The modern day Bolshies will be at each others throats soon enough.

        The Taki article and today’s post are perhaps the two most important commentaries on current political affairs that has been written in the past century. Con Inc. is foaming at the mouth in their zeal to persuade Normie to vote R at all costs in 2022. Dan Bongino will even come to your house and personally beat you if you try to stay home, and every other DC grifter is on the floor jerking spastically in their purple-faced rage at the thought that voters may wise-up and shun the next election. And yet, boycott is likely to be the only hope for a peaceful change in our political life.That said, the modeling suggests that it will fail because Normie is too comfortable in his latte daze to make such a leap of faith. As long as the printing presses roll and his paycheck cashes, he will toe the line and pull the lever. And the seminal lesson of 2020 is that the managerial class owns the vote-counting system and will manufacture any outcome needed to maintain the status quo. People will not (read cannot) accept the truth that the system is fatally broken until real hardship returns and they have no other choice but to face reality as it is.The next hard truth is that the collapse is the cure. We must hit bottom before Normie can wake from his slumber. And then things will get interesting. When the time comes, wear the fog and act with focus and precision. It’s the only way to be sure, and frankly, the only way to actually earn a better tomorrow.

                1929-1932 was not a collapse; it was an economic depression.1988-1991 in the former Soviet Union was a collapse, and a mild one at that.
The USA is now approaching 50% obesity levels, and the models predict that that is a gamer changer for the next real collapse event. Hogs and cattle are typically fatted right before they go to slaughter.

        The current narrative from the GOP is that Trump cost them Georgia, which cost them the Senate, which handed total control of the government to Democrats. The GOP viewed that as an unforgivable sin. However, look at what is out there. The Dems can’t get their key legislation passed, the legislation they said was inevitable after they won Georgia. Inflation is out of control. The supply chain is still completely broken. People are dropping out of the labor market in droves. The COVID mess of 2021 is completely on the Dems, despite all media resources being corralled to blame unvaccinated yokels in red states. What would have happened if the GOP won? i suspect we would have seen a lot of “deals” of the sort Mitch put together to help the Dems recently, while the GOP went full-National Review and put their efforts into explaining to their base that we need to accept the full Dem program for the good of America.I don’t know, if your goal in not voting is to withdraw your consent from this system and let the chips fall where they may, the Georgia special election seems to be a total, unqualified, runaway success and a blueprint for going forward. The current crop of Dems are neither smart nor competent, and the future ones, even less so.

                They cost themselves the Senate by not deporting every non white from Georgia (and every other state).
I doesn’t matter what position they take, non whites vote for open borders, welfare, and CRT. And nobody does that better than the Dems.
Seriously, if the GOP kept Georgia 70 or 80% white they would win comfortably with 60%+ of the vote.
Ultimately they don’t want to win and their goal isn’t looking out for the white middle class interests anyways. But the specific reason they lost is basically racial and demographic and nothing else. (And voter fraud, enabled by the above)

            Good point. To add, there is almost no doubt (although it never gets discussed any more for obvious reasons) that McConnell himself sabotaged the Georgia races when he called Covid stimulus checks days before the run-off vote. That was particularly sweet.

        I recently spent a couple of days deep in the state of WV in a small town. Most families have resided there for generations. It was sad and surprising to see the Trump signs which still remain. His message resonated with so many White Americans. He had so many of us at beephole countries, build the wall and drain the swamp. We were all swept up in the glorious Trump wave. Then we were carried out into the middle of the ocean. Now many are floundering without a life raft. Those poor people struggling with skyrocketing inflation and family members dealing with opioid addiction understand that the election was stolen from them in the country they’ve been taught to cherish. It’s hard not to imagine that they don’t somehow understand that the entire system is rigged against them.It was also depressing to spot the Amazon service center off the highway just a few miles from the town. The tentacles of destruction are far reaching.

            And those people still can’t see Trump shafted them every chance he got, was instrumental in setting up the new phoney China cold war and organized the rally for the express purpose of selling his supporters to the pharisees to set the stage for the domestic terror narrative.

        The early management theorist Mary Parker Follett advised organizational leaders to follow the Law of the Situation.  A robust effort aimed at understanding one’s situation does not automatically suggest the right path but it is a constant risk for heuristics-prone humans to let principles and axioms get in the way of a simple understanding of the situation.So what’s the situation, Kenneth?You often speak in a pragmatic way about sound organizing.  But I am not persuaded that your boycott notion is of much value given conditions at hand.I am not saying that a boycott cannot be effective.  But you need to say more about how and why a boycott moves the ball forward.You are the first to acknowledge that your side is at present far from a majority in electoral terms or that it is close to comprising “the people” in a raw political sense.  So how would your call for a boycott, sent out to a relative few, connect up with others?  Would it be meaningful in terms of amplifying a message or would it be more like a tree falling in the forest?  There is I think a very large risk of the latter.It is tempting to be cynical but there are things now going on that suggest a vast middle is losing faith in the mainstream–Hispanic voters against a policy of no borders, mothers at school board meetings being called domestic terrorists, Southwest pilots stepping gingerly around what they are up to, with a whiff of general strike in the air.  Additionally, there is a serious effort among MAGA types to gain control of the party from the ground up, and it is causing real concerns.So the question is this: would a boycott amplify this or undercut it?  I think it would probably undercut it.  You may be jaded but most Americans have some expectations still for the system.  Perhaps the events above will be enough to move a lot of Americans to a new place.  Probably not.  I think for them to get angry enough to go where you want them to go they will need to keep trying harder, forcing the Regime to be bolder and bolder about pulling the rug out over and over again.There is not a zero chance of progress via the electoral system.  I say we stick with it for several reasons.  First, I don’t like the idea of conceding that the republican form should be put out of its misery.  History suggests it is hard to like what may come next.  Plus if the Regime overplays its hand there is some chance of electoral success.  Finally, even if the Regime is forced to resort to open tyranny its opponents will only benefit if its operations are forced out in the open.

            Are you aware of any democracy which has ever voted its way out of such institutional and cultural rot as we are having?
I get the conditioning of not wanting to give up and vote harder for some new person or party (which doesn’t exist), but all efforts of reform have failed.

            “I am not saying that a boycott cannot be effective. But you need to say more about how and why a boycott moves the ball forward.”An organized national election boycott may delegitimize the result — certainly a democrat victory in all presidential elections after 2024 — in enough minds to make it difficult for the regime to impose its will on the population. It makes more people open to resisting because they no longer put any faith in the system. They have no skin in the game.Also, it makes the public more willing to consider alternatives like a national divorce. It may also force the regime to compromise once states begin reasserting state power because conservatives are then focusing on the local and community level.Legitimizing sham national elections only ensures they continue with the same null results each time. Obviously, “voting harder” isn’t working, so what exactly is the harm in going another way? The worst that could happen is that you get the same results as voting (and losing).

                        If 2 years of forcing people to wear a muzzle in a western society when they are outside their house, imprison them in their house for weeks on end, restrict their ability to work and travel internally without getting an experimental injection does not wake people up, I am wondering what you think will?This should demonstrate that 90% of people will internalize any injustice if it is pushed in the right way.Let me spell it out: They are never going to wake up as they are not asleep.They are NPCs running preprogrammed media scripts and can no more wake up than you dog can suddenly realize he can drive himself about.

            Thank you for this post. You are the “classic” latte-drinking Normie that I often refer to in my comments. Your addiction to the Comfort First Imperative is so powerful that you will bend over backwards to rationalize suicide as the optimum solution. It is this mindset that becomes a precursor to official genocide and resulted in the deaths of over a 100 million innocents during the 20th Century. That is your superpower, the ability to persuade others that the Jim Jones’ koolaid tastes good.

                Are we chalking up Powell as a pro-war malefactor now? I’d argue he was worse than the openly neocon frat brothers, because he only signed off on it, seemingly out of pique, after his peers at Turtle Bay “dissed” him. Powell should’ve resigned as soon as it was apparent that Cheney would get his way.C. Rice was of course, did much worse than Powell as the follow-up act. Meanwhile everybody says Gates was obviously more competent than Rumsfeld but isn’t this due for revision? The best thing you can say about him is the Chinese fire drill in Afghanistan was pushed off not just to the next President but the next one after the next one.

                    At the time I thought Powell may have been too stupid to realize that he was being played.  That’s not to forgive anything, or say that he was a great guy otherwise (he wasn’t) but I seriously doubt that he, say, wrote any part of that spiel that he pitched at the U.N.

            It will be interesting to see what the regime comes up with for the narrative on this one.  If he had the booster, they will have some real problems coming up with spin even their faithful followers find credible.  If he had not taken the booster, that will most likely be their go to line.  I would like to hear what the doctors gave him.  Although as an 84 year old cancer survivor, he may not have been helped by anything.

                BingoHe had one foot in the grave, another on a banana peel.
If he was given the booster, I highly doubt the media will allow that to be articulated.
Why would anyone think we would get a straight answer?

Judging by this, the narrative is to use this to push the boosters.

                    Haha. They are never going to say whether he had the booster or not, just go straight to the propaganda.  Powell was probably vaccinated in January so any benefit he would have received had long worn off by now.  It doesn’t matter what happens, boosters forever!

                I’d disagree that they control it. As z has pointed out here, it seems unlikely there’s some grand conspiracy that the party is involved in for ballot stuffing. Instead, they take away all safeguards and say to their fanatics, “Now don’t do anything” [wink]. It’s like the shoplifting in San Francisco. They took away consequences and said, “now promise not to steal things.” Then the people take care of the rest and act as expected.

            Exactly right.
And even if nobody shows up to vote, reports in the regime media will be record turnouts and mandate for the victors.  80,000,000 votes!  Complete with county by county breakdown and fancy colorful maps.
They already work around the clock to manufacture legitimacy for the stolen 2020 elections.  They will continue to do that in the midterms and beyond.

Have to say, I’m still voting locally, where the cost of shenanigans is perhaps too high for the reward. Still  believe in town hall democracy.

        Careful what you wish for. The Republicans are the Stupid Party, but compare the US Republicans with the Canadian, Australian, and NZ politicians. Most of you can still do things like own guns legally, go to restaurants / theaters without proof of vax, go to church, and cross state lines (can’t do that in Australia, the most locked down country in the world). In the rest of the Anglosphere, the “right wing” parties have identical platforms to the leftist parties. Imagine Bernie Sanders vs. Pete Buttigieg (right wing) vs. Ilhan Omar.There is not even a debate about mass immigration, CRT, or endless lockdowns here. It’s just accepted as a fact.In other words, Republicans still have limited utility. I’m not under the delusion that we can vote our way out of this, that Republicans are on our side, or that they can ever be reformed. But you will pay a steep price for abandoning the side that promotes your interests *some* of the time.A two-pronged approach is necessary. First of all, keep bullying CivNat cucks, and Republicans mercilessly. Do not give them an inch of space, and if they promote your interests reward them with a vote. For instance, DeSantis and Abbot banning vaccine passports. Don’t worry about Red/Blue stuff, just vote for the Republicans who do semi-useful things.The second prong is accepting that in the long term this isn’t enough. Demographics alone prove it. That’s why IRL organizing (even with just a few friends or family), sabotage of the system (sand in the gears), and the creation of parallel societies is so important. Vote Republican for breathing room, but the real work is done at the community level. So when the one party state eventually happens, you’re better prepared.Rage quitting and accelerationism is a nice fantasy, but that just leads right to a gulag. We have to be realistic and work with what we have. Republicans are not the worst thing ever – but you can’t expect them to solve your problems.

The GOP *is not* the last hope, only hope, or any hope at all.
But they can be used as useful idiots while Dissidents do the real work behind the scenes.

                    there is no big right-wing party as equal considering lockdown and pass.
More and more Trumpians wins GOP primaries.
More and more civcucks left the party (Rodriguez, Ohio)
So, no, I’m not trolling. I think not voting is the express way to suicide.
I would have not say that if the GOP was still Romney-Bush-McCain.

            (But I disagree on your “Demographics alone prove it” pessimistic theory. I think a lot of latinos and a significant minority of black workers will vote more and more GOP. Even Rudy Teixeira admit it. The democratic coalition can’t survive with a so big rule of crazyleft “educated” white people)

                The critical mass of crazy upscale whitefolk does make the Democratic Party unstable, but it doesn’t threaten them if these crazies have nowhere else to go.
Nobody has proposed a serious alternative that would siphon off these college-loving boogie Democrats (clearly now including ex-Republicans in the millions). The Green Party is clearly too down-market and stinking of patchouli oil, but in other Western countries they make a real problem for whoever is the center-left major party.

                    Maybe it’s because I came from the left. I have still some leftists tropes. Not voting is insane for me, as it is insane for every leftist.At the opposite, I have very often see right-wingers having the incounscious desire for “glorious defeat”. I’m not at all like that.

Incidentally “Boogie Man” is a fun documentary about Lee Atwater.
Since the end of the Clinton impeachment Southern GOP office-holders have become more fashionable and sensitive to the manners of enlightened rich wokeocrats, something I was assured (by Northerners) was impossible at the time. Nancy Mace or Madison Cawthorn is a prototypical social-climber GOP box-ticking hire in the New South now. They have mostly shaken off the anti-telegenic (teledysgenic?) DGAF ambience of the Jesse Helms days. Also I realize it is unfair to accuse Cawthorn of social climbing but my newspeak capabilities failed me at the moment

                There’s no reason to believe that when we have decades of elections that prove otherwise.“The democratic coalition can’t survive with a so big rule of crazyleft “educated” white people.”I think it can. We’ve seen time and again how easy it is to whip up racial hatred and get people to vote on the basis of “our side vs. theirs.” Emotion is often enough to overrule logic in democratic systems. Thus, Larry Elder was painted as an Uncle Tom “black face of white supremacy” and the democrat was returned to power.That’s how the people of Venezuela returned a disastrous Hugo Chavez back to power after he wrecked the country (“our social class/ethnic proxy vs. theirs”). That’s how the people of Zimbabwe returned Robert Mugabe to power in a democratic election after he destroyed the place with his land seizures and resultant hyperinflation (“our race vs. Whitey”). This is how Gavin Newsome just won his recall election in a landslide (“this is our territory” — Kamala Harris).Will racial minorities really ever vote for the White party? I doubt it. For example, both C. Rice and C. Powell voted for Barack Obama, twice, over the White republican candidate when both were former republicans. Those supposedly race-blind republican blacks chose to vote for their racial representative over principle. Millions more will make the same choice in the future.One day an unpopular democrat who should lose will win a presidential election on the back of racial block voting because those groups would rather have their guy in charge than vote for the hated White other. This will come as a huge shock to the few remaining civnats.

                    Most French voters are still French. And, perhaps ironically, the non-Caucasian vote was one of the key differences in the current French president being elected (nearly all Muslims — a growing demographic — voted for him).
Normal White Americans simply don’t have enough people to win presidential elections anymore. It’s getting to the point where this will become true in some European countries soon. The right will be permanently locked out of power due to racially motivated, anti-Caucasian voting. Who wants to legitimize that?

                        This just happened in Canada too. There’s been 2 elections in a row where the “Conservative” party won the popular vote and vast majority of land mass, but the Liberal party won more seats.The non-white voters, particularly black, Sikh and Muslims are now so numerous in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal that there are enough seats there to carry the Liberals to victory. Hindus and Chinese might vote Conservative a little more but still break Liberal overall.So despite having a far left platform identical to the Liberals, the “conservatives” still lost because of demographics. If you are white or rural, you have no voice. Sadly most boomers and rural people don’t understand this and they were mindlessly clamouring to “vote out Trudope”.This is a good example of when one shouldn’t vote.

            It’s a tough needle to thread, for sure.Local is the key word. For all our faults, there are still enough Americans working locally to bring pressure on a governor like Abbot. Every now and then you get a DeSantis. Or you castrate a wannabe dictator like we did in PA, or you simply defy orders so they aren’t enforced.Politics is always about power. Local is how you build a leviathan to take on the big boys. They’re already incorporated, we need to incorporate our thing. It might paradoxically bring on their collapse. MAGA almost got the job done, but the grassroots weren’t strong enough to sustain it. Top-down plan trusting can only get you so far.National GOP needs to go. Locally, it can be taken. Then maybe state, maybe federal. You’re right in the long run, imo let them twist in the meantime.Big IF there’s still life in this thing.

        They have people casting ballots for the infirm or dead, they skim off third party votes into their tally via computerized voting machine algorithms, and they are importing millions of illegals to vote or at least use they names under which to vote.  They only thing that your casting a vote against them does is it that it may force them to pull up a truckload or two of nameless filled-out identical ballots in the middle of the night to make up any unforeseen deficit they face in an election they want to win.  Without your voting, they can just declare they won in a more timely fashion.  Whether you vote or not all depends on if you want to see them exert a little more effort to be declared the winner.

            This is my approach as well. Like putting the ball in play in baseball or taking a shot on goal in soccer/hockey, voting will test the abilities of our adversaries and the more pressure the more likely they make a mistake.
Let’s not kid ourselves and assume that the Uniparty is omnipotent like the frickin Matrix. What we are up against are a bunch of midwits who have to oversee the operations of a lot of vibrant riggers. There will be cracks eventually.

                That’s why I’ll vote for Trump again, not because I think he can save our already murdered country. Our evil ruling class HATES him SO FREAKING MUCH they will desperation cheat and it will be even more obvious this time, with many more normies receptive to the possibility and watching than last time.Even if they were cognizant enough to understand the ensuing cascade of delegitimization and destabilization, they won’t be able to control themselves. It’s pathetic, but their time preference marks them for what the vast majority really are: overpromoted dreg proles whose genetic lines were never part of (for good reason) our natural aristocracy. mercantile duh-mocracy for the win!

        Another approach that would be delicious is blatant ballot stuffing.  It doesn’t even need to be illegal, but just a lot of people running around who are a *tad* pushy about who you should vote for.  With mail in ballots, if you can get the poor schmuck to sit with you and the ballot, most will go-along to get along with whoever you *persuade* them to vote for.
Make it an emotionally painful experience.

        Mmmm. Others have said it more eloquently than I but this is my take. I won’t vote anymore because my vote will be negated by some vibrant person in Wayne county. Simple as that. Couple that sentiment with the whole “… if we get the house back we can do X!” Along with “… if we get the Senate back we can do this!”. Lastly “… Trump will be able to appoint supreme court judges!” Here we are, Obamacare remains, and the supremes were not even going to hear any a case about voting irregularities. I/we have given the Republicans plenty of opportunities and they have not reined in spending, repealed Obamacare, or have done anything that merits a vote for them.

        You cannot complain about the system if you do not participate in the system is the logic of democracy. It is a bizarre logic when you consider it.
Yes, mindboggling: you knew the rules going in, you signed on the dotted line, you promised to obey whomever the electoral process put in charge and now you’re out in the streets with your placards and your bullhorns, demanding special, extra-democratical consideration?

            Exactly. If you vote for a candidate from a party that literally never does anything about the issues that you can about – immigration, the Dems bashing whites, etc. – even when they control the House, the Senate and the presidency, then you have no right to complain.
The GOP did everything in its power to thwart Trump. If you vote for any Republican who isn’t openly against the GOP leadership (which is none), than you have no right to complain.

            If G.W. Bush has taught us anything, it’s that Con Inc. presidents are even worse than Democrats.  At least Obama never pretended to be our friend.Like has been said several times, The federal government will become just like California, and it’s just a matter of whether it will take ten years or thirty years.  Democracy has never been a winning system for the traditional right, and it’s time our side primed themselves for something new.Yes, it will mean 20 years of pain, but it’s better than 50 years of slow boil where your male children will end up getting mandated estrogen shots, for the science.

        I’ve mentioned to few people that I will choose to not vote. It definitely has an effect. Beyond the usual “if you don’t vote, you can’t complain,” you can see that the concept of purposely not voting has simply never crossed their mind.
Sure, some people don’t vote out of laziness or indifference, but to thoughtfully and willfully chose to not vote something that they’ve neither seen nor heard about. It makes people think. Now, whether they think it’s crazy, I can’t say, but it does make them think.

            I would encourage people to be situational about it.  Go vote for men like Mo Brooks or Paul Gosar if you have those options and leave the rest of the ballot blank.  There are maybe 10 or so Republicans in Congress worth voting for.  If you have decent local and state candidates vote for them too.

                If a specific candidate is openly critical of the GOP or openly opposes immigration, I could see voting for him. However, this only proves my point.
You have to first stop voting for traditional GOP candidates for the GOP establishment to notice when you do come out for candidates that appeal to whites.
Force the GOP to choose between dying as a party or changing. I seriously doubt that they will change since their donors don’t want it, but if that’s the case, we need the GOP to die anyway.

        In other words, even a poorly organized boycott could prevent the Republicans from getting the House. It is a low cost, high reward strategy to send a message.
The message that the establishment would receive from such an outcome is that the alt right is irrelevant and that the Biden Reich is on the right track.

            Election boycotts are a tried and true method of delegitimizing the ruling regimes of many despotic countries. Once people vocally check out of the system, more extreme measures like civil wars, independence movements, and coups become possible. Voting in elections you can’t win only serves to legitimize them while quelling the opposition.“One of the reasons that CA has turned into a third world shithole is that conservative people checked out of the electoral system in the early 90s. Leaving the field to dems.”That isn’t really true. Republicans can’t win in California due to demographic change. “Voting harder” won’t make a difference when the state has actually seen a total decline of White Caucasians by approximately one million since 1980 while the state has massively increased the number of non-Caucasians.Donald Trump won almost exactly the same number of White votes in California as Ronald Reagan did when the latter won the state; Donald Trump lost California to both democrats in landslides. Almost the entirety of the difference was due to demographics. The same fate awaits every current Red State in the near future. Georgia, a Deep Southern state, is already now a blue state. So is formerly red Virginia. Florida and Texas are up next, and the reason is almost entirely demographic.“The second even larger problem is that the right – the white Anglo American culture – is too individualistic, which makes collective action all but impossible. The metaphor of herding cats is appropriate. The left wins because the stick together and keep pushing, forever.”I agree with that statement. It’s possible conservatives simply lack the cognitive tools to deal with this new multicultural world and are doom because of it.For example: I was watching Razorfist last weekend. He’s a YouTuber Millennial (maybe gen x) and fan of Donald Trump. He perfectly encapsulates the cognitive deficiency of so many conservative types. I believe he and the chat discussed the SouthWest Airlines situation — pilots not showing up for work to protest the regime’s vaccine mandate. But then, of course, they eventually started ranting about unions and collectivization. It never seems to dawn on many older conservatives that there is power in group action, which is why the SouthWest Airlines pilots were successful.SouthWest Airlines pilots coordinating their actions en masse is why they were successful. That’s a lesson Leftists don’t have to be taught. They know it instinctively, which is why they are so successful. They work in groups and coordinate boycotts, protests, strikes, and walkouts all the time. They also work with each other to blacklist conservatives from many industries, which is why the entertainment and news media industries are so far left.Downside of unions = inefficiency &lt; Power conferred to the masses by collective action.If the right controlled every union in this country, we could collectively walk out of the job and we&#x27;d get our way on basically every issue. But being right about some ridiculous economic dogma is so important for some that they can&#x27;t see the potential benefit elsewhere.Here&#x27;s an article that discusses why the Left so easily beats the Right:TL;DR: Leftists are more politically active, refuse to compromise with the other side, are willing to punish the other side, and work in groups while Rightists do none of those things, so they lose.Note: this is a huge blackpill for anyone who thinks democracy is the solution. Studies show conservatives will always lose in such systems.Cardinal Preferences Explain Why All Institutions are Woke.https://americanmind.org/salvo/why-is-everything-liberal/And, the difference between liberals and conservatives is likely biological (genetic):https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052970

                That isn’t really true. Republicans can’t win in California due to demographic change. “Voting harder” won’t make a difference when the state has actually seen a total decline of White Caucasians…CA voted Republican through the mid 90s. in 94 it enacted a proposition by a wide majority that restricted illegal immigrants civic participation – that was struck down by the courts.Following that court intervention a lot of conservative people gave up on the voting as pointless – as is being advocated here.  And things quickly got much worse.  The one time they came together was 2003 to eject gray davis and elect the outsider Schwarzenegger – which obviously didn’t work out – largely because he was an outsider and didn’t understand the system or how to reform it.  Sort of a proto Trump.Since then, there has been a downward spiral – no grand resolution as the boycotters hoped.  Today, reform is even further outside the overton window than it was in 94 or 2003.Takeaway – boycotting the system does not work on a timescale of 25-30 years. Maybe it will work over a longer horizon,  in which case your great great grandchildren can start rebuilding from the collapse.  But it won’t happen in our or our children’s lifetime.  No matter how much you wish otherwise.

One would think that conservatives voting in elections and losing in landslides would do the trick even better. You did everything you could and still lost, so they’ll figure the people have to be on their “right side of history”. You’re just an irrelevant minority unrepresentative of the majority public in such a system.

                    There’s a “meta” issue here though: most whites still feel that self-organizing is not only unnecessary, but wrong, because they think their concerns can be addressed within the system via the ballot box.  Something that would go a long way towards improving our situation is the group realization that strategy is nothing but fantasy.

            Well, let’s do a pascal’s wager on this:If you vote, nothing really changes anyway and all you’ve really accomplished is adding a little more legitimacy to the systemIf you don’t vote, doesn’t really matter but they will simply manufacture the “legitimacy” through the same fake votes used in 2020 or whatever else.  So, same as above.If you don’t vote, you personally will not have added to the legitimacy, they will need to use shenanigans to create legitimacy, and the shenanigans have a decent shot (given the internet nowadays) of at least being raised if not found out.Only one of the above actions creates the possibility of delegitimizing the system – not voting.  They will spin how they want to spin.  Best we can do is force the spinning to show itself for the spinning it is (to our fellow countrymen, and perhaps more important to the rest of the world).

        I made a commitment to never voting republican again after senate republicans unanimously voted to make Juneteenth a holiday. I’ve seen nothing since that would convince me otherwise. It’s clear the republicans exist solely to gatekeep their own side on behalf of the left. There are countless other examples, like that moron senator from Indiana who embarrassed himself on Tucker Carlson embracing BLM because Chuckie Schumer might get mad at him otherwise. If republicans get power again, they’ll do nothing in our interests, just more tax cuts for Google and lobbying for Middle Eastern wars.If this is a choice between a slow and a hard boil, we might as well give in and get it over with. Enough voting to stave off the inevitable. Bring it on. No more of the lesser of two bad options.I think the next step is to have local and state republican parties disassociate from the national party, which is coming anyway as demographics will soon turn national politics into a retread of California’s one party politics. Why vote to legitimize that? That’s how we’ll get a real third party.

            But this disassociation of the local Republican party from the clearly cucked, Uniparty national Republican party happens somehow by magic if you refuse to vote for local Republicans who have indicated that they are at least somewhat on your side merely because they are nominally Republican happens how again? Even if they are only running for state or local office?State political control is still possible in some places (sadly not here in NJ), so why toss away at least the agency available through state sovereignty by a blanket “take my ball and go away” non-voting strategy? Is there any clearer indication of lack of seriousness in local organization amongsoi dissantdissidents than this? Nullification of centralizing federal power is possible to some extent on a statewide basis, on a local basis not at all. So this sounds like Grand Strategery while disregarding the chance of local tactics of, at minimum, buying a little space and time for raising up locally or regionally potent parallel institutions to nullify or counter reliance on federal structures.

                If I ran the book I’d set the over/under on “SEALs who under any circumstance are convertible from /theirguy/ to /ourguy/” at one guy, and I’d have a thousand shills bet the under.

            Still don’t get it. I made the point last week about how I don’t understand why they’re now pushing normal white people *off* the plantation.Seems much worse for the system to have a bunch of pissed off, unemployed white guy Navy Seals with nothing to lose, than to have them roped into servitude with promise of pension and promotions.That really goes for every white guy. I’m being pushed out as well. If I were President I would want people like myself working inside the system rather than hating it from outside.Maybe they really are planning on exterminating us and the death camps are coming sooner than later… that’s the only situation in which their behaviors make sense. Then again maybe they’re just crazy.

                If elections didn’t matter at all there would not be any sturm and drang around them.
Elections were held and didn’t matter at all in the Soviet Union – and there was no drama around them.
That there is so much drama indicates that they do still matter here.   That doesn’t mean that they are entirely free and fair or whatever.  But there not completely pro forma either.

                        Exactly. It’s theater. I remember in ’08 the HRC people at the DNC were so angry that the party kept changing the rules on the fly to make BHO the candidate that they earned the sobriquet “PUMA” (Party Unity My Arse.) They did the same thing in the last election cycle to kill enthusiasm for Tulsi. The “R’s” pull the same stunts.

Voting in elections you can’t win due to mass immigration and demographic change does that. Worse, you legitimize your loss and quell your own side by participating.

        There some truth to what you’re saying, but it’s not 100% accurate.One of the reasons that CA  has turned into a third world shithole is that conservative people checked out of the electoral system in the early 90s.   Leaving the field to dems.  Which in turn became increasingly deranged.I’d say the real problem for the right i this country is two fold.First it doesn’t have any affirmative agenda.   It’s hard to get what you want for any paradigm when you don’t know what you want in the first place, and don’t try to get it in the second.The second even larger problem is that the right – the white Anglo American culture  – is too individualistic, which makes collective action all but impossible.  The metaphor of herding cats is appropriate.The left wins because the stick together and keep pushing, forever.   They’ll take a little victory and immediately start pushing for the next, even if it takes a decade or more to advance the ball again.   The right in contrast spends most of its time sniping at each other.  Comes together infrequently, usually at a point of crisis, and  acts like it’s all or nothing at that exact moment.  Usually resulting in nothing.

            I am starting to think the left wins because it’s the agent of an invading foreign force that uses democratic politics as its vehicle. The right doesn’t defend because it doesn’t see the invasion for what it is, instead they see it as the normal political process. And if it is an invasion what can be done about it? The democratic government has taken all police and military powers for itself and it itself is the invading entity; there’s nothing left to defend against it.Call it colonialism by another name. The power behind the left has nothing to do with democracy, it just uses democracy as a vector of attack. The winning response that saves us and our lands will be undemocratic and unfortunately illiberal. Voting is a poison pill.

                That paradigm is entirely consistent with my observations that the right doesn’t know what it wants and sucks at collective action to get it.

                    The right ultimately does know but cannot bring itself to think it. Their own private rule following prevents them from even considering the goal. Hence they are ever caught in refusing to look over the wall lest they think bad thoughts that contravene the public rules they have internalized.The left, on the other hand, lays claim to public rules but seem to have no internal rules, so have no hesitation in changing these 180 degrees at a whim in deciding to exterminate its opposition through direct action and force.Those who set the public rules will ultimately control both sides through these mechanisms.

            The biggest difference I see (assuming it isn’t all just a show anyway) the Dems will use power, the GOP simply fears it.  For mostly ill, the Dems do things when they get in power, the GOP does everything it can not to accomplish anything.

            Most conservatives are “live and let live.”  Libertarian.  “You do you, I’ll do me.”  Federalist.  Let the local community decide most issues.
The lesson since the 1960s is that most people are not like that.  That libertarian trait probably has a genetic basis and it is not widely dispersed around the world.
Ironically, any libertarian country would have to be very restrictive about who gets to enter and vote.

        Honest question…
What is the best approach?  Just not visiting the polls?  Visiting the polls and turning in a blank ballot?  Visiting the polls and voting for a ridiculous 3rd party or write in?
I am leaning towards showing up and turning in a blank ballot, but not sure what might be the best way to demonstrate withdrawing consent.

            I’d reason that not turning up would be the better option. Compleatly withdraw. That time you spend queuing up with paper Americans could be better spent tending to your cucumbers, acquiring a skill, or preparing for violence by state actors.
Of course, getting a tasty sandwich would also be a better use of your time.
That said, if the polls in your area are full of ‘our type’ of people, you could do a bit a probing whilst waiting. But definitely a ‘No’ to queuing with Chan, DeVonTray, Ranjeet, Okigbo, Afshar, Gomez and Lin Dinh Dong.

                OrangeFrog:  You just described what it was like when I suspended my ‘no voting’ vow and voted for Trump.  And it reinforced how absolutely imbecilic it was for me to take the time and trouble when I knew – I absolutely  f&amp;&amp;king knew – that my single vote would go into the pool of votes cast by Chan, DeVonTray, Ranjeet, Okigbo, Afshar, Gomez, and Lin Dinh Dong.Even those pushing ‘vote locally’ fail to accurately account for the personality type and work/financial background of anyone who succeeds in politics to the point of getting his name on the ballot as the representative of one of the two parties.  It starts with money and backing from the establishment and never changes.  It would bankrupt the average man to run a campaign in America, even for state rep, without massive backing from big money and big name and the organizational backing from the party apparatus.I used to vote for a guy who was our rep in the Texas legislature.  He had money and I read he had greater ambitions, but when I grilled him personally (accidentally bumped into him when he was out campaigning and shaking hands) he sounded genuine, to the point he gave me his business card and welcomed any challenges or questions.  And in the beginning, his votes were fairly consistent and he at least had my respect.This guy is now our Texas rep in DC and he voted, among other things, for ‘Juneteenth.’  If he ever had any integrity or if I was merely a fool for thinking so (probably the case), he has none any longer. He in no way represents me, my beliefs, or the interests of my family.  Voting ‘locally’ gave him his foothold.  The same pattern can be discerned anywhere one cares to look.  Thinking one has someone ‘good’ or ‘our guy,’ whether on the school board or city council, is deluding oneself.  They all start the same way and they all end up the same way – with wealth and power that they will do anything to retain.

        A similar case happened with the original boycotts, back in Colonial Times. The original nonimportation etc. agreements weren’t very effective, economically. Setting aside for obvious reasons the more, ummm,vigorousresponses to things like the Stamp Act, the various boycotts are worth looking at, for the reasons you describe. Economically they were a pinprick at best, but politically they showed that the whole mercantile system was bust, at least on the Colonial end — the Crown needed the Colonies far more than the Colonies needed the Crown.A voting boycott, even a small one, would work the same way. The political class needs votes, any votes, to validate their existence. Just as a king whose knights won’t ride out to battle on his behalf is just a weirdo in funny clothes, so a democratic politician who can’t get anyone to vote, for OR against, is just a bad community theater actor, declaiming xzheyr lines to an empty auditorium.

                Obvious fraud would be even better, from our perspective. A Democrat winning with 100% of a tiny number of votes cast would be great… but a Dem winning with 95% of some huge number of votes cast would be even better. And yeah, I know, if they were smart they’d produce some remotely realistic pattern of “vapor votes”… but they’re not smart. Look at Brandon, the Most Popular President Ever, who won with the Most Votes Ever Cast. That’s the level of intelligence we’re dealing with here.

            “Vote harder” is the Griller version of the Left’s mantra about Big Business. I’m sure you’ve all seen the meme: “The government is controlled by Giant Corporations. We need more government regulation, to protect us from these Giant Corporations.”This is why I call this pathetic excuse for a country the Autistic States of America. So many people seem unable to “think” in anything other than really simplistic binaries. “Electoral fraud” is Bad, but “voting” is Good, and therefore, by some principle of “logic” I’m not nearly spergy enough to understand, the one cancels out the other, and voting harder in a rigged system un-rigs the result.(and yeah, I know that’s unfair to people who actuallyareautistic, but it’s the closest I can get).

                Severian:  I still just mutely shake my head when people wax rhapsodic about voter ID.  Sure, you show a driver’s license and it says you’re Fitton Ngoy from smalltown, USA.  Your voter registration matches.  Instant, honest election.Except NO proof of citizenship or anything else was required when said Ngoy registered to vote.  Absolutely anyone can get a driver’s license anywhere in the US today, and that’s really all you need to register to vote.  Even as meaningless as citizenship status is today, it has been utterly irrelevant at the voter registration level for many decades.  And Jane Normal still thinks “voter ID laws” will save her.

                    I’m a big fan of voter ID laws, but only because they’re a useful tool with which to beat the Left — “yes, I totally agree, poor minorities are far too stupid and lazy to be expected to do the tiny bit of legwork necessary to get a government ID card… except for their vax card, of course.”Not that the Left is in any way impacted by this, of course — “cognitive dissonance” not being a thing in their world — but it does help to drive hometo Normiethe utter futility of engaging with these people. You can’t argue someone out of a position they were never argued into, and you can’t argue a toddler into (or out of) anything. The Left are just overgrown toddlers, and any tactic at all that helps Normie realize this is to be embraced… so I love me some voter ID.

        Sorry Z Man, I ought to say that further, I think the idea of a general boycott would be good for our souls, but infuriate wokeists of all stripes. “How dare you not vote!”, “People died for this right!

        A good line to use on normies on this issue, “the people condemning you for being reluctant to vote for more of the same all voted for Evan McMullin in 2016.”  They will never hold themselves to the standards they use for us.  Although a few like Jonah Goldberg were so delusional they thought McMullin could win.  I wonder if National Review still has his column posted on how if McMullin won Utah the House could be persuaded to elect him.

            Just checked, of course National Review wouldn’t remove a gem like this:
https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/10/evan-mcmullin-president-possibility/
Only in Conservatism, Inc. is it possible to still have a career after writing something like this.

                “McMullin, whom I’ve met several times, is an earnest, patriotic, and brave man who spent nearly a decade serving his country undercover in the CIA.”
So, a true outsider then.

        Speaking of revolts, in Chicago, it is quite possible that Mayor Brillohead will start stripping officers for not logging into the city portal and giving their vaccine status. They have created a new category called “No pay, non disciplinary “, which is equivalent to saying, we’re not gonna fire you, were just not gonna pay you.Mind you, they’re not doing this for being Vaxed/unvaxed, they’re doing it because people aren’t letting the city know their vax status.It’s against the rules, as there is no language in the CBA, but no one ever said that the government has to, you know, play by the rules.CPD is the canary in the coal mine. Over 40% of the membership can walk with a pension today.It will be interesting to see what transpires.Also, the news is reporting the events as a labor strike. Disinformation in real time.

                You are correct.Motion to have Brilloheads’ former partner recuse herself is being heard as I type.Will be interesting to see how it shakes out.

        “If you don’t vote for more of the same, the other side will win.”Yeah, that old trope. I mentioned it here the other day, but this was one reason that normal conservative types at some point thought that not voting was an endorsement of Jeremy Corbyn and his ‘radical’ Labour supporters… yet the biggest piece of government overreach happened under a ‘Tory’ watch. So what if Jezza whacked up taxes for ‘the rich’ (whomever they are); maybe, just maybe, he wouldn’t go all sissy over a virus. Although he probably would’ve, still, it is (or should be) incredibly instructive to the eyes of the normal person.If you’ve got a politician problem, just import more Somalis. These boys go direct to action… just ask David Amess.

            Indeed  the UK has had one effective policy direction since the 50s, irrespective as to who got in. With a little bit of tinkering to suit the color of the apron in nominally in charge.
Look at the state of the fucking place, all torn down piece by piece by every govt in the last 50 years.
Most people can’t even bring themselves to accept the 2 largest cities in the country are now minority English.
This has happened within my lifetime.
How the fuck does that happen?
