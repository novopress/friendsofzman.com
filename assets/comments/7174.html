        “Turkey has the European disease and the Muslim disease. That’s going to be lethal.”Yes but now most of Europe has the European disease and the Muslim disease. Maybe a better way to characterize Turkey and Western Europe is as a co-dependent relationship– they mutually enable each other. Co-dependency is a tough nut to crack. Worse, their mutual pathology is going to bring them closer together, not drive them further apart.“The Turks under Recep Erdoğan are an unreliable partner and becoming a source of instability in Europe.”Frankly you could argue that Germany is the primary source of instability in the relationship. After all, without the Turkish guest worker program, which started back in the 60s, how would the Germans be where they are today? It established the muslim foothold in Germany and gave birth to the retarded logic that importing muslim brown people leads to positive economic outcomes, and that muslims can successfully integrate into western society. The Turks were just happy to follow along, and fifty years later, the relationship naturally evolved to where it is today. It’s like the US blaming Mexico for illegal immigration. If we had just built a fucking wall, and enforced sanctions against the employment of illegals, we would never have had the problem in the first place. Instead, we did the exact opposite, and the Mexicans just followed our lead.

        When Turkey was secular it had a chance of becoming a part of Europe. Now, as with all countries run by religious fanatics, which includes the entire Middle East except Israel, it has begun its slow (or maybe not so slow) descent into madness.

                I take your point, the unelected leaders of all three countries are not religious fanatics in the sense that the Wahhabis are. But Islam  is the state religion in Egypt and Jordan, and Syria is disintegrating. All three are police states that are constantly under threat of being taken over by Muslim Brotherhood types.

        Don’t forget that the Turkish military has a long and storied tradition of playing politics (wasn’t that one of Ataturk’s “reforms” — the right of the military to step in and “save” the constitution?).  If the generals and Erdogan ever seriously get out of step we could see a simultaneous civil and regional war.  If the fallout from Syria’s Obama-sponsored “civil war” is bad, the fallout from Turkey’s would be unimaginable.  The Turks are already taking potshots at Sovi….errr, I mean, *Russian* fighter-bombers.  Could get ugly real fast.

            Erdogan purged out the secular top officers.  I think the military is loyal to him now, not Ataturk’s tradition.

        Turkey may not have much future in Europe but your president (PBUH) before he departs is pressing hard for Turkey to be a burden on Europe. Given that we have weak-kneed and weak-headed ‘leaders’ over here they will be bowing to Obumble’s fading wishes as soon as they can.For me the biggest problem with Turkey (other than I do not want the UK to be part of there EU before the inevitable floodgates open to the Young Turks) as far as I can see they own a chunk of Europe on the wrong side of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. In an ideal world, seas and waters represent borders, but while the Turks have a foothold (literally) in Europe it is hard to eject them from our thinking.

        I checked the CIA World Factbook. TFR = 1.8. They also have a moderate (compared to East Asia) male/female imbalance, probably due to parents selecting a more girls to abort than boys.   But as in Turkey, higher Azeri, Kurd, and Baluch birthrates may be masking much lower ethnic Iranian TFR numbers.   I think that is what Spengler has been writing about.

                Once the revolutionary generation heads to the rest home, the whole edifice comes crashing down. It gives me some small solace that, using indicators like abortion, total fertility, and prostitution rates, I can draw a reasonable inference that the Ayatollahs have done a more thorough job of destroying their society than our own Western elites.   I guess I’d have to rank it Commies, Ayatollahs, Cloud People.
I think I’ve read that opiate abuse rates are through the rook as well, Z.

                I think the Persian TFR is even lower than 1.8, at least according to Spengler.  There are other ethnicitys within Iran that may have a higher TFR than the Persian’s.

                    You’re probably right. It’s hard to tease out the strictly Persian rate, even assuming one can properly define “Persian” in a biological sense.
