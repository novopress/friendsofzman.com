        A key reason that the Jew Thing is growing can be summed up with Every. Single. Time.
It is hard to get around how members of the tribe are proudly leading the charge on everything we hate. This was true in Weimar too.
Now we have almost all key members of the Biden administration being of the tribe and the Israeli wing doubling down and blatantly committing genocide while the American wing and both wings of the uni party enable it then censoring people for noting the obvious. Now they are shutting down TikTok for wrong think on the issue.

                Whitney:  I have found this extremely effective when discussing the JQ with people who have not considered it before.  They’ve all seen the famous pictures, but have never heard of Magnus Hirschfeld.

                    Thanks for the names to research, in your comment and the replies.I think any group of successful, cohesive and prosperous people will dominate politics the way the jws have, there are aholes of every race, no need to dislike jws in general, when I can just dislike crooked lawyers, bankers, politicians and word-clever psychopaths of all races. And it must be considered that jws were forced towards the money lending trades in the middle ages, and aholes (especially ruling class) will always hate those they are supposed to repay – that’s hundreds of years of bad mouthing from elites, whose traitorous piggery makes them much worse than jws – who have some good historical reasons to dislike gentiles.The interesting thing about the current jw-hate, is the success they are having at ending the riots. Why are our garbage ruling class unable to insist on common sense imprisonment of bullies = terrorists = govt supported thugs?If jws are that powerful, I’d much rather get them to  take sides against the anti-civilization left, than scared of the right(which is just retarded policy for both sides)

            That’s the problem with it, it isn’t every single time.  Lots of white WASPs hate us too, plus blacks, Indians, and Muslims. Kamala Harris does not hate us because she married a Jew, she hated us before she had even met him.  There are also a handful of decent Jews like Paul Gottfried and Stephen Miller.  Notice what is happening and that most of them hate us and adjust accordingly when dealing with them, but don’t let it consume your mind.

                        In all honesty, my personal dealings with Finkels have been overwhelmingly positive. They even leant crucial aid to my wife and I on a few occasions. However, this does nothing to change the fact that they, as a people, are no good for my people whatsover. That is a painful truth for me to accept, but then the truth often hurts.

                            Same here. Had a couple of Jewish roommates in college, a close friend who died last fall, God rest his soul. Other dealings of course, but those were the closest.
They were Jews, and I was not. They made that more clearly than I did. Fair enough, there are limits then. Different substances don’t mix, and you’ll only make a mess if you insist on trying. Probably end up fighting, to boot.

                            There are excellent people of Jewish descent just trying to make their way in crazy world. However, almost all of them fall into the “unhelpful” category as a nation. At best, they are narrowly working for their own interests. At worst, they are actively tearing down our civilization. That great neighbor ultimately is going to side with their themselves or their family when it counts.

                            Yes, it’s the odd realization that as individuals Jews may be fine, but on a societal and political scale the emergent property of in-group preference is obvious to spot.
It’s why Jews always say people should be judged on an individual merit. And yet ironically and intentionally they behave in a tribal manner when it suits them.
It is foolish to treat “the Jews” as individuals in settings where “the Jews” don’t treat “the Jews” as individuals.

                It’s true. One of the things Sailer has been bang-on about is the total hatred of White people that Obama and his wife have, particularly his wife. He wrote a book about it shortly after Obama took office, obviously the book was ignored, but proved prophetic once Obama won in 2012 and the mask came off.Obviously there are not enough Jews on planet Earth to keep up the anti-white animus, which is why the regime is building out and selecting the bureaucy, professional class, judiciary, etc. to keep it going. Yet, who is doing the selecting? Kamala Harris hates White people but she is also a total moron and a terrible politician – she is getting pushed along by some elements.

                    I catch grief for it, but at the levels that matter the Puritans are the primary problem, the Jews the secondary one. Take out the former and the latter falls into line.

                            Exactly. The Puritans fall into a Judaic mindset. But only a Psyberterian might accidentally fall into worshipping a Jew. Further, a psyberterian will have sympathies for Christian thought and worship, even if he or she is most in thought like a Jew. The issue is that historically we can find Puritans letting Jews in for want of wealth. But taken as their own groups without that influence, they are not as corrosive as Jews.

                    You raise some interesting points. Jews are far from a monolithic group. In the West we’re mostly familiar with the Askhenazi (European) but there’s also Sephardic and Mizrahim (mostly mid-east). They don’t get along all that well, reportedly. That’s about the extent of my knowledge. Yet knowing even the basics raises additional questions to ponder.Consider that, for all practical purposes, the average American or Western Jew is indistinguishable from the average white bread Gentile from those nations. Wouldn’t you think this would be problematic if Jews really intended to empower non-whites and “sic” them on legacy white Americans? For discussion, speculate how a White Jew distinguishes himself from the Gentile next door. When the black or brown mob is at the door, or more likely, a majority non-white committee is flexing its newfound muscles, just how is the white Jew going to convince them he’s an ally and not Whitey?Whether we like it or not, identity politics are the future. At least whites have in favor the fact that most of the other color teams come up a bit short in the IQ department, which is a significant handicap in the competitive sport known as survival.

                        “just how is the white Jew going to convince them he’s an ally and not Whitey?”This line assumes wisdom on the part of the white Jew. In reality, the white Jew is like Sisyphus, never learning that rolling a boulder up a hill always leads to the boulder rolling back down.White Jews are incapable of understanding the consequences of their own actions; partially due to what appears to be a faulty memory that lets them forget their worst behavior. It is why they are always shocked when they get kicked out or when bad things happen to them.The Jew of Malta is a wonderful play on the foolishness of Jews and their inevitable ‘getting hoisted by your own petard” moment. In this particular incident, it is wonderfully ironic to watch white Jews having to worry about the brown and black mob they actively invited into western nations.

                A sensible take. The Finkels have done the helluva lot of damage. When it comes to harming the West, they have punched far above their weight. But there have also been far too many whites who lustily joined in on the anti-white feeding frenzy, and were even heavily involved in chumming the waters.I go on about the Postmodern Thing a great deal, I know, but please indulge me once more. This philosophy is the basis of the New Left ideology for annihilating the West, and its canonical philosophers are almost all white. The only Finkels of great consequence are Zygmunt Bauman, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. (Fellow Finkels Helene Cixous, Judith Butler and Thomas Kuhn are considerably lesser fry.)It is, therefore, meet to be wary of the Finkels and in the future take steps to eliminate their power and influence. But equally important is policing our own ranks. If we don’t, we’ll go down the tubes yet again, the Finkels will return like a belch from a tin of tainted herring, and the Jew Thing will recrudesce, too. None of that is necessary if our focus, aim and vigilance are what they should be.

                NAJALT…I was telling someone that we needed to rid ourselves of the jews and he started naming off “good jews” who were “on our side”.  I told him that no number of “good jews” was worth keeping.

                    Odd.  A few years ago I got to watch a Rabbi, preaching in Israel to his congregation, say something to the effect that, “…the best goyim is not worthy of life…”.Seems the feeling is reciprocal.  Regardless, such extremes on both sides, may not be the norm of the population.  How to decide who is on what side seems impossible and downright dangerous if decided wrongly.  Separation may be the answer, but now we delve into finer and finer gradations outside of the major one, race.  ID has already voted for elimination of Puritans—or those of such thought.  Any other suggestions?This is getting complex as we travel this road, and such complexity is often fatal.

                        The feeling is not reciprocal. Gentiles basically just want the Jews to leave them alone, live elsewhere, stop interfering. Only on the far, far extremes I have seen a want for the solution that Hitler also did not implement. The Jews are different story.

                            If you were of a race that suffered what the Jews did in WWII Europe, would you believe anything said to you now about such people’s intentions 80 years later?  I thought so.  Hell, even I don’t.  Just because you are not jumping up and down yelling, “Bring back the ovens”.  Does not make you any less a perceived threat when you jibber-jabber about a Jewish world conspiracy and control of societal institutions and such.
You of course may be right.  What I’m talking about is Jewish perception.  Your perception means nothing to them.

                                Jews were saved by the death of tens of millions of whites if you believe their BS and given a country.  So they should erect monuments of us. Instead it was actually Jews in control of US, Russia, and England who rejected peace and started the War. All in a plan to invade white homelands with colored people and erase us. Degenerate Jew behavior was pushed to far in Weimar and Germany had enough good whites still to stop it. 6 million is a huge lie they would have had to ran into Germany to die to believe that. Wasn’t that many Jews in all of the territory Hitler took combined. Idiots.

            “A key reason the Jew Thing is growing can be summed up with Every. Single. Time.It is hard to get around how members of the tribe are proudly leading the charge on everything we hate. This was true in Weimar too.Now we have almost all key members of the Biden administration being of the tribe and the Israeli wing doubling down and blatantly committing genocide while the American wing and both wings of the uni party enable it then censoring people for noting the obvious. Now they are shutting down TikTok for wrong think on the issue.”Goodness! What have we here!? Some goofy, uneducated hick going crazy with “the Jew Thing”? He must be one of those who are susceptible to it.Don’t worry, most enjoy a full recovery from the brief fever of Noticing objective realities!This poster cites the live action genocide in Gaza and the near-100% composition of Biden’s Cabinet made up of individuals who make up 2% of our 320 million populace as reasons for sperging out about ” The Jew Thing.”What a maroon! Rest assured that the only explanation needed to allay these concerns is the simple recognition that this is an inevitable function of group loyalty at work inside a pluralistic society. Any other suggestion is a feverish manifestation of“The Jew Thing.”Don’t worry, most mature out of this infantile delusion. This guy will be fine, unless he decides to kill us all first, like those Covid whackaloons.Let us now wax very verbose indeed concerning historical minutiae. For example, did you know that there were 37 instances of flatulence during the Treaty of Westphalia? Oh yes! As ALL learned historians will tell you, this was due to King Chesterfield of Nicotinia introducing a new strain of wheat into his kingdom in an attempt to break the grip of the mercantilism eroding monarchical power, and serves as a wonderful example of that principle first posited by Sir William of Bumbleboots, “Insert Latin phrase here.”Yes, nothing marks out the intellectual giants quite so much as an exhaustive, not to say wearisome, command of History. Except the History of a certain desert tribe. That History carries zero meaning, and any discussion of it is only a lamentable manifestation of the fever arising from an obsession with” The Jew Thing.”.Moving forward in today’s Cavalcade of Modern Maladies, let us consider Buckleyitis. The symptoms are many and varied, though its chief manifestation appears to be Sniffing One’s Own Farts With Delight While Wearing A Bow Tie As One Invents Tortured Rationalizations To Explain Away The Blindingly Obvious.Thank you, Good Lord, for creating me so stupid I cannot see the Emperor’s Gorgeous New Clothes, relying instead on believing the things I can see with the 2 eyes You gave me.

            Blinken and State have come out and said that “Hamas must be preserved” and made “moderate” and that a Two State solution is paramount, with some sort of mega-deal across the region. Meanwhile Israelis are stopping aid columns to Gaza, destroying the food and beating the drivers unconscious.So it looks like “they” are as divided as we are, the Italians, the Irish, the French, etc.Modernity hit them hardest, first. Lacking strong rural roots, home or better substantial land ownership (creates conservatism both social and otherwise), and being highly educated and professional, they were the first to drink up: feminism, managerialism, socialism, material utopianism in all its Lennonist, Colors of Benetton corporatist forms. So they are hardest hit: compare/contrast Jack Warner, Louis B. Mayer, Samuel Goldwyn, Stan Lee, Siegel and Schuster, and of course Jack Kirby, to say Sarah Silverman and Amy Schuster. The guy who created Captain America or the guy who financed and made “Yankee Doodle Dandy” are like space aliens to the modern crop.Now look at others: Bambi Thug of Ireland, Macron of France, “Jungle” Josep Borrell, John Kerry, Al Gore. They all drank deeply. Modernity creates these people, the way anti-modern land ownership of even a small estate creates the opposite.

            The storied Austrian painter of the early 20th century went from a failed revolt in 1923 to leading a government that was elected ten years later and the rest is history as they say. Of course his era was one of a humiliating defeat in a great war, onerous reparations imposed, a runaway inflation that destroyed the economy, and other distress. The GAE arguably has been defeated in many little and (to date) relatively bloodless wars — at least for our side. Throw in a major economic depression or other turmoil and all bets are off.

            But it’s not every. single. time.  But it’s often enough that an undeniable pattern emerges.Some have responded to your comment with heartfelt NAXALT.  In my case, a professor who helped with my thesis was chosen.  We hung out a few times socially just because we got along.I think there are 2 crucial observations when thinking about the good chosen and non-whites.1. In spite of the goodness of the ones we like, it is very likely that if that group achieves a sufficient population size in our lands then the stereotypic consequences associated with their group will happen.  In spite of the good ones.2. Even worse, when it really matters, the good ones will usually side with the bad ones of their group instead of you, when there is conflict.For most non-whites, most of the time, race commands deeper loyalty than shared values.  Whites are too trusting and naive to see this and are easily misled.

                Also, whites are divided by generation, ethnicity, and sex/gender amongst themselves and by culture from non-whites. Those of us on the right have taken concepts such as liberty, individualism, citizenship, the nuclear family and the nation-state for granted for far too long, while those on the left are consumed with the identite’ du jour and are actively hostile to those “Western Civ” concepts. As for non-whites, nepotism, tribalism, ethnocentrism and extended family (admittedly, rather chaotic in the case of Afro-Americans) are dominant. I don’t know how whites are going to organize in how to become a power bloc, but in certain areas of the country, whites seem to be acting tacitly yet effectively in keeping the left at bay. In West Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, the Scots-Irish vanguard have shown their flinty self-reliance in voting en bloc against the blob. We can consign the Emily Dickinson and Sylvia Plath College alumnae harpies to the terminal ward of the triage, and the pasionaria wannabes who have yet to obtain their Queer Studies diplomas, but maybe, just maybe, enough MEN, young and old, will get tired of being the scapegoats for the failures of our enemies. In the meantime, the main squeeze and I have contingency plans to vamoose from the city’s outskirts and light out for the territory–what territory remains.

            I would also add that Republican Party, which is ostensibly supposed to be on our side, doesn’t help matters by always simping for the Jews, who are associated with the other side of the political spectrum. Consider that telling us we MUST like Jews, we MUST support Israel and we MUST be bombarded with news about Israel on the TV everyday might just have the opposite effect on people. YOU WILL BE MADE TO CARE.

        Well, one reason for the Jew Thing is that Jews run the country and the West – but no one is allowed to talk about it. Therefore, it’s not exactly shocking that young people upon discovering this fact – a fact that their parents, their schools, their government, their media, heck, even a lot DR pundits like Derb either deny, ignore or dismiss – get pretty interested and a bit mad.I may not see a Jew in my sandwich, but I do see Jews or Gentiles who are in their job because of Jews when I look at our presidents (except Trump), Congress, our foreign policy “experts,” Wall Street, the media, academia, etc.Indeed, I’ve always found it odd that so much of the DR punditry class, particularly of a certain age, view discussing Jews and Jewish power with the disdain of someone farting at a dinner party. It’s like their commenting on a football game but don’t like to discuss that both teams are owned by the same guy and that the officials, coaches and quarterbacks are the owner’s close cousins/friends.But I agree that a changing America is making it harder for Jews to control the narrative and new forms of media are allowing a younger generation to discuss Jewish power without being squashed either by Jewish pressure or the pressure of the punditry class.

            Re the young:It is a crowning irony that many/most of those behind the following, to the degree they can be disentangled, were Jewish:Anti-white racismMass migrationDeindustrializationCensorshipEach one of those things, often for contradictory reasons, have soured the young on Jews and Israel. Jews are seen by them as white, and those prone to anti-white racism hate them as well; mass migration has brought hostile young Muslims to the West; deindustrialization has led to economic displacement and focused on who runs finance’\; and censorship clearly is a Jewish value and the young like TikTok. Taken together, it was too toxic of a brew aimed at the young not to explode.

                Jews are simply bad at running a country, especially as a foreign elite. Their complete lack of self-awareness and aggressiveness make them terribly unfit to rule over other peoples.
They’re failing because they were always going to fail. The conman doesn’t make to good CEO. We’re witnessing the fruits of that now.

How except Trump? Jewish daughter, Jewish son-in-law who were enormously influential in his Presidency, and when he left office he didn’t pardon any patriots or people on the right, he pardoned a bunch of Jewish criminals and their pet gang-bangers.

That’s because the programming was really entrenched in them so even though they know deep down the jews are behind most of the degeneracy and rot that is affecting us today they can’t bring themselves to talk openly and honestly about it, so it’s always in a roundabout way so they have an out if they are called out about it…

                That’s part of it, but I’d say that it’s also about what acceptable in their social circle.No surprise, the punditry class – even the DR punditry class – is heavily Jewish. Naturally, the members of that class start to form friendships. When they go to meetings – secret or not – they’ll be around a fair amount of Jews or Gentiles who are friends with Jews. They’ll also correspond with one another.Whether conscious or not, these friendships and the desire to be accepted by your class and people you respect will have an influence on how you think and what you write.There’s also a class issue. Jews are very good at associating any talk of Jewish power with low-class and stupid whites. The punditry class – even the DR punditry class – is pretty snobbish. Smart people hate to be seen as stupid by people they respect, so steering clear of the JQ or dismissing it is a very safe choice.Don’t underestimate social pressure in many DR writers unwillingness to delve into the JQ.

As Lenin said, the way to control/defeat the opposition is to run it. This can be by having Your People be the leading lights of the so-called Opposition, or having the shabbos goys, who can’t stand their conditioned aversion to farts at the dinner party, run it in accordance with Your Interests. Easy peasy.

Only thing missing is that silly accent Buckley put on.I keeps it simple: you are either in an existential struggle or you are not.What I undertsand as the DR pundit class is not in an existential struggle.  It’s why I don’t take any of the supposed elderly eminences in this thing seriously.  They seem more concern with decoroum than self-determination, and appear afraid of mass politics, or what waging such politics entails.  In short, they are losers.  Maybe polished losers, but still losers.The older ones who used to be somebody, they are only here with us because of Jews.  By choice, they would never asscoiate with most of us.  They got ran out of conservatism and off the airways by Jews and want to blame “liberalism” for it.  It’s like some kind of weird Stockholm syndrome.

        Not to dwell on semantics/Semitics, and you do allude to this, but “the Jew Thing” merges into “the Israel Thing” and it is hard to disentangle the two (it can be done, to be clear, but whether it is a distinction without a difference is a different matter). The first televised ethnic cleansing is well underway, and the complicity of Western governments is undeniable. People also are noticing that Israel gets prioritized over their concerns, the ADL acts as a totalitarian censor, and what happens in Tel Aviv is far more important than what is happening in Kansas City or Rochester. All of this has been known a long time but it mostly was suppressed to larger audiences with success.Much of this is recency bias, then. For both the obsessives and those otherwise aware, it is confirmation bias.The Gaza slaughter is one of those rare inflection points that is recognizable as such in the moment. Most who had a preconceived notion one way or another will not change, but for others their perceptions have been made quite dim. It is easy to claim this conflict is not our problem because on paper it is not our problem, but given how bribed and slavish our policymakers and politicians are, the reality is it is our problem. Netanyahu is striking while the iron is hot because he knows (a) the GAE is in rapid decline and (b) the post-Boomers have no use for Israel, and many have been led to see it as “white” and hence evil. It is not without irony that many American Jews, who also flooded the country with hostile aliens, fanned the flames of anti-white racism.Jewish power and influence reached its apogee with the 2020 coup and its ascendancy to the halls of power in the Biden Administration; its peak within finance and media was just a bit earlier. Like the GAE it subverted and diminished, that power also is in rapid decline now. The clock is ticking.

            Good observations. To take this a little further, the entire “stand with Israel” crowd are now tarred and feathered by the Gaza atrocity bombings. They’re never going to get that stink off. Adding insult to injury was the recent congressional letter to the World Court threatening anyone who has the temerity to broach the subject of Jewish complicity in mass murder. That really was a bridge too far. It will look even worse as time goes on.

        Or maybe, Z, people are just mad that Israel is using America’s money and weapons to commit a genocide. Maybe people are mad that the people who are supposed to represent them and America’s interests are putting Israel’s supposed interests and desires above their own, constantly and continuously. Maybe people are mad that they are seeing college students protesting this situation get their skulls cracked by thugs waving the Israeli flag while cops look on, as happened at UCLA.Maybe one of the reasons why this “Jew thing” flourishes is that it is simply impossible to discuss these things or even bring them up without being accused of having some deep-seated, underlying, and totally irrational hatred of Jews.

Exactly. Z Man, for all his “anti-anti-semitism” (for lack of a better term), would be considered a hate-filled anti-semite for even what he has to say about the JQ.

                People keep saying this, but the protests started after the bombs firing missiles on childrens’ heads, and really got going after Israel dropped a bunch of bombs on aid workers trying to get food to people that Israel is intentionally starving. This idea that the protestors are actually protesting “Western civilization” or “White people” is just retarded, quite frankly, when all evidence on the ground (at least until the ratfuckers, Israeli thugs, and Antifa started showing up) points to the fact that no, really, they’re protesting the people committing and paying for a genocide.

                    Tend to concur. I have no special love for either side. And even granted that there has been a lot of lying about casualties, that is just par for the course in war, and this is war. Just for argument’s sake, let’s believe that anti-Jewish groups orchestrated most of the student and other anti-Israel protests since Oct. 7. Even if that’s true, it doesn’t change the facts — more precisely, the public’s perception – that Israel’s retaliation was oddly heavy-handed. Or domestically, that student protests were shut down rather forcefully too. Surely none of this goes unnoticed by the world, or by Boobus Americanus. Well, maybe it does. But whatever their motives or justifications, I cannot envision any way that the Jews could have botched their public image any more blatantly than they have. The least self-aware people in history, indeed.

                    I do have some sympathy for the young protesters and not just in a “stopped clock is right twice a day” way.  They’ve been taught all their lives that evil white colonizers oppress the brown masses.   Then they see what appears to be a clear, acknowledged and openly celebrated example of exactly that.  Then against all their prior life experience they get their skulls cracked for protesting, all because they are violating a very serious rule they had no reason to know even existed.
Let’s hope this is a learning experience.

        The problem with instilling mafia-like activities at a person is, once your power dwindles, your victim isn’t exactly going to show sympathy. The ADL essentially overtly threatened Musk several times, and once they lost their fangs, Musk intentionally started to do things to anger them. The first salvo was putting EMJ back, and now Fuentes.Torba is another example. If I remember right, he was mildly embarrassed by all the anti-semite content on Gab, but after n times trying to wipe him from the internet, he wants blood.It’s crazy, since the ADL had enough clout to make reasonable deals that would benefit them, but were so overtly vicious to anyone who didn’t toe the line 100% it destroyed all their good will within a few years. Doesn’t help their spokesman looks like a demonic goblin.

            The ADL is a good example of how cognitive decline has hit Jews very hard. That guy running it is a moron. It is also an example of how the old restraints are breaking. Thirty years ago the people in charge knew to keep the ADL on a tight leash and make sure the face of it was not the poster child for antisemitism.

                The ADL is on the same trajectory as the SPLC previously was–useful component of the Left rapidly becoming a liability one outrage at a time. Someone probably will dox the group, up until now likely impossible due to TLA’s, and release its donor list soon enough. The day when that would not matter has long passed.
Abe Foxman was just as atrocious as Jonathan Greenblatt but was able to keep himself in check. Greenblatt is a typically impulsive leftwing rage head and has no ability to control himself.

                Zman, the oldrestraints are breaking on both sides.  In the past, the Jewsremained aware they were 2% of what was a traditionally culturally Christian country.  They didn’t push quite so hard, and cloaked their animosity towards Christianity as a push for democracy, equality, and pluralism.Now, though, even while they never forget (or let anyone else forget) that they are ‘different’ and ‘special,’ they are also convinced they are the epitome of the average White.  Everyone they grew up around and went to school with and worked with was Jewish, or deferential to them, or shared their contempt for the average ‘flyover’ American and the Anglo-Saxon roots of this country’s culture, morality, and jurisprudence.So they feel free to let their anti-Christian, anti-White ‘flag fly,’ and are then stunned when they actually get some pushback.It’s not just cognitive decline – it’s hubris.  They knew they were large and in charge when it came to media, finance, education, etc., and they genuinely didn’t expect any disagreement.As everyone else notes, they overplay their hand Every Single Time.

            People are tired of cowering in fear of having their lives ruined by #metoo, LBGTQWERTY, trannies, ADL, SPLC, every black person in the country, and the rest of the grievance wolf pack.
As Chet Rollins points out, these outfits keep dialing up the oppression until the population won’t stand for it anymore.

        One of the reasons people catch the “Jew Thing” is something pretty unique to Jews which is that antisemitism is criticizing any Jew who has ever lived.  This and their unique ability to publish stuff in their own papers about how they play a leading role in everything so many of us find revolting.  But then when they are called on it, you get the whole “we dindu nuffin” routine and how you’re just an antisemite.  “We don’t run the banks!!!  That’s wasps!!!!”Sadly though, catching the whole “Jew Thing” is very real and that’s why I mostly stay out of it while remaining critical of Jewish power.

                Whitney:  It wasn’t just specific to Catholic countries.  Jews love to complain they weren’t allowed to buy land in Europe, and that’s why so few were farmers.  They were ‘forced’ to become pub owners and moneylenders.  Unfortunately,  the average individual doesn’t usually make the connection and wonder why no Jews took advantage of the Homestead Act in the US – instead the few who went west remained merchants looking for profits.They didn’t want to buy small holdings to become independent families and farmers – they wanted to become large landowners and join the landed aristocracy of the nations they temporarilyresided in.  Because native nobility wouldn’t welcome them with open arms, they shrieked ‘antisemitism.’  Akin to the country club argument they use in the US.Just as blacks never wanted ‘equality’ but rather to hold the whip hand, Jews never wanted to be ‘just like everyone else.’  Equal, but also special and powerful.  No contradiction in their minds whatsoever.

        The “Jew Thing”, as you derisively dismiss as though some juvenile phase, is being rediscovered because of jewish behavior. Germans caught the “jewish thing” in the 1920s because of what jews did to German society and to Russian society post 1917. The “Jew thing” phase only passes when the total control over goyim societies by jews makes it dangerous and illegal to keep noticing as we now see with Congress passing Noahide laws as per jewish demands.

            He’s right that the Jew thing is a snare for the unwary. People need a positive way (positive ≠ optimistic) to address the lifespan of a human being. The creed needs to ask and to prompt answers to questions like these:• What is existence?• What is the cause? (Note: doubly loaded question here.)• What is a human being?• What am I?• To what natural class do I belong?• What are correct modes of living?• What is my task?• How can I accomplish it?• Is it a good idea to revere foolish ancestors or to emulate their most cherished ways?• Why are flattards so fanatical and obtuse?• Has the left “a crushing intelligence advantageover the right, especially among the elites”?And so on. Obsessing over the Jew thing diverts one from the these important questions, which few people in the West care to answer correctly. This is especially so among people who call theirselves liberal, progressive, democratic, conservative, libertarian, scientist, capitalist, socialist, English, Scottish, Irish, American, German,.., right wing, leftist, Muslim, Christian, or Jew.

        Yeah. Not sure if this idea of countering the most extreme forms of anti-semitism is really necessary. I mean, we don’t spend time worrying that some right-wingers, having begun to question the truthfulness of scientists lately, become flat-earth proponents. Why? Because there are very few of them.Same thing here. I mean, the real question is how much _should_ we be thinking about the Jew Thing? And the answer is something like: enough to convince yourself that Jews are a pernicious presence in a country and that they have no business anywhere near centers of influence. Our ancestors very frequently decided they had no place in the nation at all, and these decisions were probably both right and just.But, I guess, once you’ve convinced yourself of all that, you could move on to other, more productive, lines of thought.

                        The early response appears to be people buying Butker’s jersey online.  That gives more money to him, but also the NFL.  If the NFL doesn’t do anything that is actually punitive to Butker the whole thing will blow over and nothing will change. As long as NFL sponsors are satisfied nothing will happen.

                Kooks always assume that a lack of enthusiasm for their thing is antagonism toward their thing.
It sure seems so sometimes. Perhaps a favorite fictional Shemite provides the best example:
He who is not withMe is against Me, and he who is not gathering with Me, scatters.
Me, me, me. This is the sum and substance of the hero’s religion, which some people struggle not to confuse with the Christianities. The kewk, however, was simply tweaking his nation’s torah (teaching), itself only a way to organize national supremacism on the basis ofa crudely disguised human egoism.

                Not sure if you’ve been paying attention, but “lack of enthusiasm” over Christianity hasn’t been a problem.
There’s been plenty of enthusiasm about Christianity in the US over the past 50 years. Read that sentence once more time. It should now occur to you that not all enthusiasm is good, as you assume when you use the word.

                            I love you guys. Really.  But just because I say something vaguely positive about Israel or the Jews folks start assuming I am a Jew.  C’mon fellas, put the jew-thing in perspective.  That’s the point of Zman’s post.  Turning  the Jew-thing to “eleven” makes one look small and bigoted.  Keep it at “three”, which is about where it belongs –  “five” at most.
(FWIW, I am not a Jew, and I have got them pretty much figured for what they are.  What they aren’t is a splinter in my brain).

Better for the long term survivability of the NSDAP that the likes Theodore von Karmann, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, Leo Szilard–I could go on–were in Germany rather than working for the USA.

                        Read some actual real history. Hitler didn’t push war the Jewish controlled areas of England, USA, Russia did. He didn’t gas 6 million or any Jews. One of his Sgt got put to death near the end of the war for killing 2 Jews. If he was gassing millions how would that make any sense?  Wooden doors for a gas chamber makes sense. Wasn’t even 6 million Jews in all the territory he took combined. What did Jews run over there to be exterminated. The insane stupidity. Look at historical records of the numbers of Jews. Even in those they don’t even lie and show some 6 million disappearing. It all makes no sense because it was a huge lie. How many Gas chambers were found in the bases USA liberated??? 0 because the soldiers didn’t lie even tho there politicians were Jew controlled and lied to get us there. Gas chambers Were only found in the ones the Soviets raided. Who controlled the Soviet’s??? I could go on for hours as I’ve don’t research. But much Hitler.

        Not sure why ZMan uses the word “antisemitism” at all. Like “racism” or “homophobic” or really any “anti-” or “phobic” it means nothing whatsoever but what our enemies deem is useful to manipulate us, and changes all the time to fit any situation. I guess it’s technically correct, but using it only allows them to frame the argument and establish the moral high ground. I would decline to participate in their rhetorical games.

            I caught the Jew Thing about ten years ago, while researching a reputed ancestor. I learned that my ancestor’s (Robert Morris)  accomplishments had been usurped, and attributed to his underling, (Hyam Salomon) in an egregious case of Stolen Valor. Fell into the JT rabbit hole; still working my way out.

        Observing negative jewish behavior isn’t antisemitism.  Antisemitism is anyone or thing jews themselves don’t like, which explains the increase in antisemitism:  Jews pretty much dislike everything that isn’t money or related to sexual perversion.

        “Jews earn like Episcopalians, and vote like Puerto Ricans.”  There was really no good reason for American Jews to be so left wing.  They were not harmed nor were they blocked from opportunity or advancement and could kinda/sorta blend as white to a degree.  When Jews created Hollywood, the early moguls were patriotic and there movies followed in kind.  Nevertheless, Jews were leaders in deconstructionist education, feminism, black movements, open borders, Norman Lear mass media fable TV/brainashing, overriding obscenity laws, etc.  Again, they’ve created a Golem for themselves.

                I know in my personal experience, the suburbs and rural areas of the midwest were very religious, even into the 80s.I didnt even have any friends whose parents drank alcohol until I moved to a bigger highschool.However, on TV, i never saw midwestern or country people portrayed as pious, charitable, well-read in scripture, or wise.  We’re all just hillbillies who love beer, heroine and guns.

            The early Hollywood moguls were not patriotic Americans – they very specifically self-identified as “Jewish Amercans.”  The old movies are full of anti-White norm themes – often quite subtle but easily detectible if one looks – pushing “we are all equal” themes, often using a black or another ethnic immigrant as a proxy.
And while they may have banded together and ‘created’ Hollywood, they did NOT create the technology for movies.  They just financialized it, like they did everything else.

                The extent of movie mogul patriotism is debatable. What is not, however, is the wealth of patriotic American actors they employed back in the before times. Prior to the 80s, patriots and conservatives were very common in movie casts. Nowadays they’re almost unheard of.

        “The most famous outbreak of the Jew Thing was in the last century when the old imperial order in Europe collapsed in the wake of the Great War. Once the old mental frameworks collapsed, people could look around and see things they never saw in the past. This stunning emergence of reality and the chaos brought about by the collapse of the old order led people to embrace new narratives.“That could be what is happening now. The American empire is in decline and people feel that things are no longer in good order. Young people, as is always the case in societal decline, feel the tremors of collapse first. That could explain why this new epidemic of the Jew Thing is hitting the Zoomers”It wasn’t just the collapse of the old European empires. In the case of Germany there had been a continuous and large influx of Jewish people from the Russian “Pale of Settlement. This prompted a group of people — even before the War — to call for their expulsion. They were seen as just not belonging. But it’s true that without Hitler the move towards expulsion would not have taken on a real dimension.In the case of the USA, a different historical process can be seen (for those who care to look). A group that was marginal a century back — just another ethnic immigrant group like the Poles and Italians — has gradually and surreptitiously taken over the commanding heights of the economy, controls the key levers of power, and is “hiding in plain sight.” And that this operates generally to the detriment of the rest of society. One doesn’t have to be a foaming-at-the-mouth anti-semite to see this. Just calling people who talk about this raving racist lunatics disingenuously elides over the issue of Jewish reach and influence. This reach has come out most prominently in the case of the genocide now taking place in Palestine. It turns out that all the “values” espoused by the West are so much poppycock and the ideological agenda is being set by powerful Jewish interests in the USA. Anyone questioning this is automatically tarnished as an “anti-semite.”On a side note here is a recent article in “Monthly Review” — a socialist journal — on the extent to which the Council on Foreign Relations serves Zionist interests:https://monthlyreview.org/2024/05/01/the-council-on-foreign-relations-the-israel-lobby-and-the-war-on-gaza/

            Arshad Ali:  They were never ‘just another immigrant group.”  Jews in New York staged massive protests against public schools having any Christmas observances in 1906.  There were newspaper articles reporting on this – along with Jews in other states taking up the rallying cry – across the country.  You won’t find any of this on standard search sites.  You need a subscription to old papers (such as newspapers.com – I used to have two different such subscriptions when I did genealogy and stumbled across the info) to read reports written at the time – not just from today’s NY Times’ version.﻿

                These people hate Christianity, Christians and Jesus so much is insane. They’re called kikes because they wouldn’t put an x, too much like a Cross, on the paperwork at Ellis Island if they were illiterate so they’d used a circle instead, which is kikel in Yiddish. In Israel, there’s a whole different sign for the plus sign,  too much like a cross. All this is easy to look up. I mean this has been going on for a long time thousands of years we’re the ones that forgot.

        The Jew Thing is much milder and low-key than it would be if there were an Indian Thing or a Chinese Thing or any other ethnicity-thing.As an example, if Indians, who are about the same percentage of the population as Jews, had the same control of the newsmedia, movies, TV, finance, government, academia, etc, as the Jews do, it would be the one subject everyone would be talking about night and day.The same would be true if it were all Mexicans or all blacks dominating all of the institutions to the extent that the Jews do.  And those groups comprise a larger percentage of the population than Jews do.The Jew Thing isn’t really a thing the way it would be if more people were aware of the extent of their domination of the institutions relative to their numbers.

            more relevant and direct from ADL’s website –https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-reacts-meta-decision-restoring-donald-trumps-facebook-and-instagram“New York, NY, January 25, 2023 … ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today expressed deep disappointment in the decision by Meta to restore President Donald Trump’s social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram.ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt issued the following statement:“Since his role in the insurrection on January 6, 2021, we have been clear: Former President Trump should not be given a platform to amplify his hateful and violent rhetoric on mainstream social media.“During his presidency Trump used social media platforms such as Facebook to spread hate and incite violence. There is no reason to believe the former president will behave differently now that the platform has reversed his ban. This isn’t a matter of free speech; there are ample services that Trump can use to spread his message. This is a business decision to platform bigotry and divisiveness to drive clicks and engagement, plain and simple.”ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is “to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.” Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact. A global leader in combating antisemitism, countering extremism and battling bigotry wherever and whenever it happens, ADL works to protect democracy and ensure a just and inclusive society for all.”

            The hatred by organized Jewry of Trump (especially by the Boomer cohort) is kind of weird.  It seems almost subconscious and atavistic.  My best guess is that it’s because he has something they desperately want and will almost certainly never have – Jewish grandchildren.

        I am not obsessed with the Jew Thing like some are, but once you see it it’s hard to un-see it. Kinda like Saul on the road to Damascus.My own red-pilling on the JQ evolved very slowly over time. 30-40 years ago I was a pretty standard-issue pro-Israel Reagan neocon. Ass-clowns like Yasser Arafat made it easy to support Israel back then. Israel was also portrayed as an anti-communist Cold War ally.I suppose the first time I ever questioned it was when Jonathan Pollard was caught. Still, it took time. 9/11 was a big turning point for me. Like most Americans I knew little about Islam. When I began to study it, I thought “what kind of religion would openly advocate slaying infidels?”But in taking Islam seriously I also took Christianity seriously and Judaism seriously. And Judaism is just as fanatical, intolerant and homicidal as Islam. The Jewish religion tells them that they are the “Chosen People,” and that their god wants them to kill people and take their land — just what they are doing in Gaza today. Christianity is a rejection of Judaism. It’s incredible how many Christians fail to see that.The entire Jewish religion and Jewish culture is about putting themselves first, and you second. Or third, or fourth. It’s about putting them in power and control over you. Once you start “noticing,” it’s incredible how many of them are in law, politics, finance, media, and government. Ever see a Jewish laundry maid? Bed-pan changer? 7-11 clerk? Tire changer? Cow milker? There are literally zero Jews in the lowest occupations, and massive overrepresentation in positions of money, power, and status.That’s fine, I guess, but I have no obligation to pick a side between Jews and Muslims. As a Christian I reject them both. My country as no obligation to pay for Israel. It’s particularly sickening to me how our “conservative” politicians are literally more concerned about Israel than they are about the U.S. It’s incredible how being subservient to the Jews is seen as the highest badge of moral virtue by “conservative” Republicans.If the Jews seek (and get) money, power and influence, then they also bear responsibility when things like the economy, foreign policy, inflation and American culture become fucked up.If there is additional scrutiny of the Jews today, it is because they truly are in control… yet America is obviously in decline, and it is inevitably going to get worse. A lot worse.

The representatives of the “people” naturally come to represent the people who make their election, re-election, and career in politics (and other politics-linked materially privileged positions) possible.
If Whites and their millionaire/billionaire ethnic class don’t organise to fund their own representatives — and boycott/denounce representatives that agree to anti-White policies, in other words, it 30x as many Whites as Jews can’t do or have no will to do what Jews do, the upshot can be only one.

        I knew one Jewish kid growing up. We were sort of friends. I didn’t give it much thought. I never heard of matzo ball soup until I was in my late 30s. A year or two later I learned it was pronounced maht-zuh and not maat-so. So I was late to the JQ.What I did learn in my time living around lots of hebrews (which was when I learned about the very overrated soup) is that just as women HATE HATE HATE betas, Jews HATE HATE HATE “middle American whites” (for lack of a more succinct term). And I am speaking of your average ashkenazi here, not some distant banker or elder of zion. Which I would be ok with if they didn’t wish to dominate us and actively genocide us.They are also very obnoxious and rude, a fact I noted with an IKAGO jewish friend. He concurred. He made a trip to Israel and told me that the jews there were also very obnoxious and rude just like the ones in South Florida. It seemed to depress him, as if for a moment he had a window into why Jews are so historically hated.

            Question is, “Are Israeli Jews “obnoxious and rude” to each other, or just goyim?”  Coming from NYC, such a perception is often related to me from visitors to NYC.  My reaction is, “Huh?  That’s the way people are in that city.”  Never even occurs to me to question such mannerisms as I take no personal slight.

        It seems to me that the “Jew thing” is a thing because it’s relevant and aligns with the experience of “noticers”, ironically to those of us with advanced degrees and considerable exposure to Jews.
When I read “The C of C” I couldn’t put it down. Even so, I have always thought of it as a latchkey to understanding the Left in the West, but not an all-explanatory revelation.

                    We need to look at Jews as an opponent in a fight. We need to dispassionately look at their strengths and weakness – and our own – to figure out the best way to defeat them. But we can’t ignore them.
We are in the ring with these guys. Saying, “Just focus on ourselves” is ridiculous. We have to focus on ourselves and on them. That’s how a fight works.

                I don’t get this line of reasoning. Jews control Congress, the media, academia, Wall Street, the president’s cabinet, etc. In addition, Jews are openly hostile to whites, particularly white Christians, and attack our people and culture constantly.How are we supposed to be indifferent to them? How is ignoring them helpful?It’s like being in the middle of a football game and saying, “Hey, let’s ignore the other team.”Should we focus on our own problems and work to move to a better place? Absolutely. But Jews are a huge obstacle toward that goal, so they can’t be ignored. Jews are like a bully. We need to both focus on making ourselves stronger and a better fighter without regard to the bully, but we can’t just forget about the bully.

                    Dispassionate could be more precise. You don’t ignore something, you just don’t let yourself get caught up in it. Idk, I’ve always found it to be the best way to get myself out of situations, even ones that involved conflict. Just doing what you have to, nothing personal. Usually less to it than you thought once the blood cools.

                        Perhaps that the distinction that Z is trying to make. (To be honest, I have no clue where Z is on the JQ. It’s the only area where I can’t figure him out.) It’s fine to acknowledge Jewish power and how they achieved it, but it shouldn’t cloud your judgement.I agree that getting angry or hating someone or something makes you far less effective. I also agree that focusing on what you need to do is the best way to move toward your goals.Focus on you improving your situation and dispassionately evaluate anyone or anything that will oppose you moving toward your goals. But you don’t ignore that person or thing that wants to stop you.The fact is that Jews are actively trying to stop us from moving forward. We can’t ignore that and we can’t just focus on ourselves. We have to do both because they are in the ring with us and they’re punching.

                Painter, not so.  Hate is not the opposite of love, indifference is.  With hate, you retain the person or object within your mind and preoccupy yourself with such.  Indifference is however, the answer as you suggest.

                    “Antithesis of values”, one of several “prejudices of philosophers” Nietzsche identifies inBeyond Good and Evil. He was criticizing the tendency of philosophers to consider that polar opposites must exist (e.g. love, hate for the current example.) Of course sometimes this is the case, as with existence or non-existence, or perhaps in physics: positive and negative electrical charges. But in many domains, it’s clearly a form of the fallacy of the false dichotomy. Who says an opposite must even exist? Why can’t there be two, three, a dozen other choices? Etc.Indifference’s opposite might be passion. Nietzsche was a big fan of Buddhism, which suggests non-attachment as a virtue, which sounds to me a lot like indifference.

        “To forestall ethnocentrism, there has to be ONE ethnicity that has a unique status to which other ethnicities cannot aspire. European Christianity failed because every nation wanted Divine Election” David Goldmanhttps://twitter.com/davidpgoldman/status/1786072634637095310
One thing that the current round of intra-semite squabbling has done is to show where people really stand. This was largely covered over by the GAE, but now the wallpaper is peeling off.

            It is peeling fast.  You never would see a small hat mention their supremacy or chosen status.  Or if you did, it was pretty vague.  Now they seem to revel in being blatant about it.  The corollary is the failures all around have nothing to do with them.

            I am an ethnic (southeastern European) and as an ethnic, I am well aware that some ethnics do shady things. That’s why I am extremely skeptical about the Jews and all their “success.” All those billions made honestly? Call me skeptical.

                        I may have missed something in the thread, but I was not referring to the Nobel Peace Prize—which is *entirely* separate from the Nobel Science Prize.  Peace Prize has a nominating committee (IIR) out of Norway, Science Prizes out of Sweden.  Peace prize has nominations by some weird process entire unknown to me, but notorious for its political considerations.  For example, Obama got a Peace Prize before he assumed office because he discussed nuclear disarmament while running for office.Look up the winners of the science prize and you will find Jews to be wildly over represented given their representative population numbers.  This is an old finding.  One which I mentioned may be a past “thing” as the vaunted Ashkenazi Jew IQ seems to be declining as with the rest of us.

                    Well, a couple of the “Nobel Prizes” that are now regarded as such were not among the original categories, specifically those for Peace and Economics, if my memory serves me well, thereby free riding on the prestige of the original awards. Who does that?

        Ah, my dear Z… you’re trolling! Shame on you!  I can hear you laughing right over the internet.
My bet is on history. When things get bad enough – and they almost certainly will… people will want to know why and who is responsible. One of Satan’s magical, hateful minions will arise to radiate magical rays of hateyness, and the poor joos will get made into scapegoats, soap and lampshades or they’ll be driven out of yet another country.

        The Jew Thing was always going to go from on the margins intellectual pundits of all sorts (good, bad, weak, etc) to the masses. It was, at some point, going to become a populist reaction without much thought.However, my understanding of the Jew Thing is that they did this to themselves. The last half of the 20th century to today was “You can say anything you like about the Jews, as long it’s completely positive and inoffensive to any individual Jew.”The West, but particularly the US,  was turned into a quasi religious state that made Jews literal sacred cows. Philosemistism infested every corner of Western Christianity, including mine on a very personal level. No mass media has had an open and serious discussion of the question after WWII. I was subjected to after school specials that made the Jews Very Special (TM). My children had to read pro-Holocaust fiction books before their own history.As the pagan god we call the Jew is no longer able to “deliver the goods” through collective influence, it’s predictable that the state religion was going to be questioned. The crowds are fickle. Adoration and endless praise can turn on dime to a mindless “Crucify him”. It’s a lesson to learn through books, not the hard way.

To be fair, the US has an entire herd of sacred cows, including gays, blacks, transgenders, American Indians, border jumping asylum seekers, and hyper-sensitive women. I’m sure I left some out.
At least some people are allowed to demonstrate against Jews. Try mass demonstrations against any of the rest of the herd and see how far you get.

                Jewish culture is proud of it’s ability to bicker. Letting a few malcontents at college protest up until recently has been just what they let the kids do before they settle down to a real job.
Meanwhile, some states require you to say you will not participate in BDS movements (boycott Israel) to hold a job.
Once protests are seen as the state allowed theater, the question of who gets to protest and why is less important.
Israel is the state religion that is backed up by laws and loss of income. The rest is not so much.

        This article is such ad hominem bullshit it is tempting to simply leave a middle finger emoji. Especially the part about the European empires asking about the JQ because their empires were coming apart. Maybe they saw firsthand how involved jews were in this process. The worst is how many articles this author wrote featuring  jews and what they were up to, but of course the current wave of anti-semitism has nothing to do with this factor. Not the first time this author has done this dance, probably wo ‘t be the last.

        Like I’ve been telling people in the past few days,“YOU BREAK IT, YOU BUY IT.”
People are very unhappy with the direction this country has gone in and the Jews had a big hand in shaping it. Jews should man up and accept that they had a big part in it.

        The thing is… sure there are some “good” Jews who may share most or even all of our beliefs &amp; be wonderful people.But when Whites say “we accept Jews who act or believe in ‘X’ ways” then that just gives the “bad” Jews instructions for how to trick Whites into accepting subversives &amp; saboteurs.Ultimately, it is safer to just exclude Jews from our endeavors entirely &amp; interact with them as outsiders with their own interests.

        Many years ago, I lived in a large city while raising my family, and my neighbor across the street was an elderly gentlemen named Burt. He had been a US Army radio operator in 1944 in the European campaign (my father was a Marine in that war). We often invited Burt to join our family for dinner (he was living alone). Burt was a ham radio hobbyist (with a huge tower antenna in his backyard) and taught my sons how to talk to people in far flung places. Burt was German by birth and his family sent him to America in 1934 as a young adolescent to live with relatives here. His parents and siblings later died in the camps. Burt was a simple man; decent, reticent, patient, and kind. Like everyone else, Burt did not get to choose the circumstances of his birth and parentage, but he played the hand God dealt him honorably.

            I read an interview given post-WW2 by a German judge who lived near Himmler and whose daughters went to school with Himmler’s daughters. Judges in Germany were very high-status individuals, in a way not readily conceivable to younger Americans raised with Judge Judy and the other vaginated diversity television clown trash, led by beaten cucks like Kavanaugh. This judge related a conversation he had with Himmler over dinner one night, where he was trying to intercede with Himmler to spare a Jew he knew from being expelled East. Himmler balked, saying that if he made an exception for every Jew who had a German to vouch for him there would be no deportations.It stuck with me because it was crystal clear that Himmler acknowledged that not all of them were a problem. It was a differentiation problem. They had no reliable institutional mechanism to tell the good ones from the bad ones. Unlike most peoples whose bad ones rape and murder individuals, bad Jews rape and murder civilizations and hence reliably elicit a murderous response from local elites.If one reads the history of the pre-WW2 era, German objectives started out as getting them to go somewhere else, then escalated gradually until it reached the camp stage during the war. They had no where else to go because no one wanted them because their reputation preceded them.I think it is one reason there was such support for Zionism after WW2. The ruling classes of Europe, who were not yet completely under (((American))) dominion, did not disagree with the Nazis that there was a Jewish problem; they disagreed with his solution to their Jewish problem. Thus, they jumped at the chance to have them go elsewhere especially because it did not involve significant expense to themselves.Alas, I think that most of the new Israelis were comprised of those not causing civilizational problems and who were sick and tired of getting blamed for the bad behavior of others. The root problem people returned to European financial centers after the war. We ended up with the worst of both paths, a rogue state associated with the West (for which we are blamed by the world) and we still have an infestation of predatory Rothschilds, Lazards, Montefi-Sebioris, Sassoons, Finkelsteins, etc.If there is ever going to be peace on this Earth, it is going to have to be all of them sent to Israel, where they are going to have to learn for the first time in their multi-millennial history to get along with their neighbors. It should be up to each ethnicity to deal with its bad individuals in ways determined appropriate by their good ones. It’s a pipe dream, I know. It’s much more likely to end as Enoch Powell predicted.

                The thing is that the ‘final solution’ is the world ending. It’s in the Bible, and I’m not making light of it. We can kid ourselves that we’re above ‘superstition’, but here we are 2000 years later, grappling with the same problems.

        I am glad that Zman had the courage to stand up to those powerful antisemites. The jewish man has been critisized unfairly for too long, taking a principled stand against the dirt people that notice the beak noses on the overwhelming majority of their cloud people oppressors is a stunning and brave move. I’m sure now they’ll like you or lay off of you now, if that is the purpose of the occasional article that you put out like this. If there’s one thing the levantine man has been well known for, it’s his forgiveness and mercy.I do not get why dissident people like you or derb write garbage like this.They’ll continue hating you either way. Nobody in your audience is dumb enough to believe it outside maybe some literal retard like Dasign or something.

Marathon navel gazing on a plethora of tortured euphemisms and a meditation on thegaucherieof the knuckledraggers who notice and discuss the gargantuan nose in the room.I come here for the Comments section, myself.

            No, there were many survivors.  Remember, some few were but children when the were rounded up and sent to camps.  Most were of course killed as they were deemed useless.  Some were kept alive and even survived.  It would be possible that 8-10 yo’s survived in 1945.  They would be say 80 yo or so today.When I was a teenager in NYC, my father worked with a number of them as they were of his of age cohort.  He often pointed out their ID tattoo on their left forearm.  At that time there were more Jews in NYC than Israel.  I have no bad memories per se of them, but really no close affiliation, just a working one.  Often when my father needed to work at these companies on weekend jobs, he brought me along when I was very young in lieu of a babysitter.  I was treated well, but not indulged.  Heck, some of my best memories was being put to work in the shops—assembly line, broom pushing, etc. to keep busy.  I felt “grown up”.  These Jewish business owners were no push overs.   😉

6,000,000? Given theincessantstream of “Survivor” grifters a man could be forgiven for the conviction the evil NS villains only managed to kill one of them, andhewas buried in a regretable motzah ball avalanche quite by accident.

        We are now at a time when even the most clueless normies are starting to realize that we have a Jew problem. The slaughter of the Palestinians is capping off thirty years of Jewish-inspired wars that have killed millions, wasted countless resources, and made the USA a pariah.

        JQ enthusiasm runs to excess because even stupid, delusional, paranoiac antisemitism is a highly accurate guide to the real world, or at least the West. It is in fact every single time—almostevery single time.
As a matter of moral calculation, or expenditure of mental energy, hating Jews more than they hate you is probably a bad idea. It’s also not really possible.
The case against Judenhass isDude you look ridiculous. It’s pink pants. Do you want to be buried in them? You go girl, if so.

Reply toMycale22 hours agoI catch grief for it, but at the levels that matter the Puritans are the primary problem, the Jews the secondary one. Take out the former and the latter falls into line.
Seems to me, if you date our current predicament to 1954-ish, it’s the Jews. If you date it to 1861 or the Reformation/Enlightenment period, its the Puritans. From my perspective, things began to turn bad middle of the last century.

        Z’Man’s blind spot. The Jewish issue is what it is, and no amount of mocking the concerns of those who bring it up will change that. Z Man has long smirked about Mike Enoch and the Right Stuff, pretending that somehow they’re just “obsessed with Jews.” They’re just right about them. Dumb jokes about Mike Enoch being the pope of antisemitism don’t change the fact that Enoch is correct on the issue. For all of Nick Fuentes’ flaws, when he monologues on the Jews he’s right on the money. The Jewish issue is what it is. You can either be honest about it, or pretend that you’re clever with John Derbyshire quotes and unhelpful posts about “The Jew Thing.”

        What most here do not realize, caught up in “every single time” is that we are witnessing the triumph of Lennonism. John Lennon. “Imagine” there are no countries, no religion. “Remember when we told you there was no future? Well, this is it.”However just because the US, UK, and other nations in the West have been turned into a Global Extended Stay hotel instead of the great family mansion for the original inhabitants, does not mean there is not fighting. Fighting for every hallway, stairwell, corner of a room even.Those on Twitter/X railing against a certain people? They are mostly the same you see in the Columbia, UCLA, and other protests. Non-White. Mostly Muslimas, black lesbians, and AWFLs. It is a very, very female led hate hate hate against anyone and everyone who is fighting against their non-White tribal anti-heroes. Who are tingle generators precisely because of their in-close atrocities. By contrast the counter-protesters outside of UCLA are mostly White frat guys who take “the White side of things” in this conflict.Dead as Adam Sandler’s career: the “Don’t Mess With the Zohan” strategy of various “consonant not vowels” speakers uniting against White guys. Instead the question is:White?Anti-White?The prelude is over. This main theme is now being sung, globally. In fact I think it highly likely that the Obama/Biden Admin, will soon have to attack Israel to “protect Hamas” etc. That is their position and Obama/CIA/State/Soros are different sides to the same object and funding/organizing these protests. Which serves their interests — Blinken in Ukraine endorsed Zelensky running Ukraine as President for Life, no elections. An “emergency” would allow them to do here what Zelensky does there. That song is also warming up in the wings.

            I think it’s clear the Jews are distinct from whites. They are NOT us. Part of the dr, I thought , wasn’t just saying that we need to vet immigrants and only let in those that love freedom and the constitution, but saying, “they’re not us.”
I think there’s a pretty good argument to be made Jews are even more alien than blacks or browns
who cares if you know a good Jews or good black, they aren’t white. That should be the beginning and the end of it.

        It’s sort of a vicious circle. The Jews gang together and manipulate the larger society and members of the majority notice and raise their hackles, causing the Jews to double down on Machiavellianism.Filtered through the ages is the notion that Jews are Christ killers or somehow intrinsically evil. The Jews, burdened by this nefarious perception, have at times tried to donate money to larger institutions such as symphonies or hospitals. But it never removes the stain. Plainly aggrieved and subtly angered, the Jew wonders why he ever bothered. Only Secular Jews escape this trap by turning their back to the synagogue and instead embracing a Geddy Lee-style “positive energy” philosophy.In the end, the problem will only be solved when Jews gradually go the Howard Stern route of narcissistic solipsism … Or a new global Hitler arises.— Xloveli (www.dark.sport.blog)

                Because thatisthe road. Rabbinical Judaism is entirely defined by the Israelites’ rejection of Christ. If you don’t understand that, and the 2000 years of subsequent history that it birthed, then you don’t really understand the subject at all.

                    But opposing the rabbinical rejection of Christ is an intellectual or theological approach. Focusing on the event of Christ’s crucifixion is an emotional one. I think the obsession with emotion is what Zoar is on about. It makes one sound unhinged.

                    The number one “Christ killer” is named Jesus in narratives called Gospels. The hero chose suicide assisted by Sanhedrin and the Romans. His method was a weasel’s way to stay somewhat within the boundaries imposed by torahs. Failing to comprehend this disqualifies you as a reliable dissident.  Believing in Jesus, even as Muslims do, marks one as a chump, too.

                    The reference by Zoar pertains I believe to the “faulty” logic of “Christ killer”, or at least an argument against it—for better or worse.  I’ll boil it down for you.God is in control of the world, nothing happens without his knowledge and “permission”. We are all in a sense powerless to go against God’s will (or God would not be omnipotent).  God sends his son (Christ) in mortal form to earth, His plan being a human sacrifice to atone for mankind and bring about the messiah and earthly change.  To do this, there must be an element of mankind used to sacrifice (kill) Christ.  God chooses the Jews/Romans.So the question is, were the Jews/Romans of “free will” to avoid killing Christ and thwarting God’s will?  And if not, then what blood guilt do they bear?  I believe none and certainly not their descendants.As far as Jews rejecting Christ, so what?  Are the a Jews special in that respect?  Perhaps, but most of the world’s population rejects Christ.

                        Good post. However, those who killed Christ couldn’t have known God’s will and therefore could not have “thwarted” it. (Thwart connotes intentionality.) Therefore, in killing Christ, they were not consciously doing God’s will. My sense is that they were acting upon realpolitik, which just so happened to have accorded with God’s will. At any rate, however, it’s disingenuous to condemn wholesale the descendants of Christ’s killers. Somebody had to do it. It just so happens that the Jews were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

                            It’s a little more like that in no timeline would the Jews in the crowd have not wanted to crucify Christ. Thus God uses their free will to his own ends, which He already knew about. They were actively rejecting God in that moment and their wishes. Pontius Pilate did not want to crucify whom he understood to be an innocent man. Thus he had the lessor sin, despite having the final ability to stop it.By modern standards, the crowd was asking for the death penalty for an otherwise harmless religious kook, rather than someone who had actually killed several in blood thirsty manner (Babbaras, the person released to the crowd).So it’s not wrong place, wrong time as it is the active, emphatic rejection of God/goodness/truth/love itself. In that some (but not all) modern Jews share that. But then again so do some modern Gentiles.For sure, the crowd that day has already met (or probably not) met their Maker. To transfer responsibilities is not helpful in modern discussions of them.

                    The history of Israelites is wandering the deserts when they live apart from God. From the time of Moses to now, this hasalwaysbeen their punishment when they turn away from God.Have the Israelites had even one moment of introspection about the last 2000 years of their history? That maybe, possibly, they are wandering in the desert, yet again, just as they did during the time of Moses, because they turned away from God? Howelsewould I describe Rabbinical Judaism, but turning away from God’s commandments?Who, exactly, was the “them” when Jesus said, “Forgive them, for they know not what they do”? Was it Rome,or was it the Israelites?Mymoney is on the Israelites.

                Read Matthew 23. It’s about what assholes and hypocrites the leaders of the Jewish religion were. How they seek titles, money, honor, and status but won’t lift a finger to help anyone. Christ says they will “burn in hell.”
Some things never change.

        This is what Aaron Renn (the Protestant Z-Man references) wrote on Twitter:“This is true. When somebody gets into antisemitism or the “JQ”, it typically becomes all consuming. It’s like getting sucked into a black hole. They constantly talk about it, and see Jews hiding behind every bush.”Renn ironically is telling the truth. This cosmos we live in is a lie, it’s a narrative – and it collapses at the center of black holes. Only in the timeless, spaceless, hopeless, Godless, merciless (and every other -less you can imagine) center of a black hole can you perceive reality.In that reality you can finally see God for who he is (a supernatural pedophile), Jesus for the homosexual he was and Maria Magdalena for the prostitute she was. It is why religious people are consistently either pedos, homos or pros. It’s why it’s so hilarious to see obviously gay men like Kanye West and other rappers proclaim to be Christian.It is fascinating to read Holocaust literature such as Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning. In it he describes the hopeless, nameless, ‘timeless’ (literally lacking in time) state of the concentration camps.That is what happens at the end of Time, at the end of every Narrative. Remember, all narratives are false and collapse eventually. Reality, which is the psychological equivalent of the center of black holes, wins in the end.This is why Jews are masters of storytelling, i.e. masters of narratives. It is the only way they can survive the horrors that awaits them in reality, i.e. by poisoning people’s minds with words. There is nothing more antisemitic than reality.

        The Dissident Right as a whole has a bad case of “The HBD Thing” which has unfortunately become chronic and is probably terminal. Until HBD ceases to be the unifying characteristic of this group, it will be confined to internet backwaters, and deservedly so. One of the many, many reasons to despise Steve Sailer.

            How would you know?  Your knowledge of the field is “nil”.  You toss the term around as a slight for those you don’t agree with.  You’ve yet to provide any examples of the science and how you claim it adversely affects the DR.  Hint:  Sailor does not epitomize the science, nor is he *ever* to my reading referenced by those in the field who do peer reviewed research.  Sailor is little more than a commenter upon the work of others.  He is so inconsequential, that I’ve yet to refer to him in any commentary/discussion I’ve made concerning HBD science.

        I think there is another X contributing to this besides the former Twitter, and that would be Gen-X. Now that the corridors of power in the upper managerial echelons are starting to look more Xer-ish than Boomer-ish, that generation, of which I admittedly had higher hopes, is proving to be very intemperate, uncontrolled, uninsightful, cynical, and surprisingly inept at dealing with real-world situations. The generation’s reputation as hard-bitten latchkey kids may once have raised expectations that, whatever other defects they had, they at least understood the bottom line and knew how to get stuff done. That hope has proven false.Generation X in power has proven itself to be a very whiney and effeminate bunch, entitled, and bereft both of intellectual horsepower and the downtrodden fighter’s understated cavalier class. In this as in many other respects, Strauss and Howe’s generational model has proven to be quite wide of the mark. In fact, with now 30 years of failed predictions to test against, it’s hard to find anything that Strauss and Howe actually got right, except the Boomers. It now seems that this was inevitable. Their whole temporal model was called into being simply to explain their own generational moment, but it began to break down as soon as that moment passed.

If it isn’t the Jews it’s the Blacks. If it isn’t the Blacks, it’s the Wops. If it ain’t the Wops it must be the Spicks.

            Being of Southern Eurpoean heritage, I joke that I’d be low man on the totem pole and the KKK would go back to lynching us if it wasn’t for blacks and certain others they hate more. So, every black cloud does have a silver lining. But look at history. Everybody can’t be wrong about the Jews.

            Jim in Alaska- Maybe you haven’t been around here much, but it’s often discussed that Whites, especially Northern Europeans, are the most high-trust, least ethnocentric people in the world.  That’s a problem when low-trust, highly ethnocentric, tribal people are in your society and taking advantage of your trusting nature.

            Not all of us escape to the top of the world to simply look down upon others.  Some of us actually live here with the inmates.
Enjoy Breitbart.
