Where did you get the idea I’m waiting for a White Knight?? Let me assure you that I am not that naive.
Z:  I loved Chris Hitchens too. Excellent debater as well as writer.

        re: Kathleen
The is no White Knight coming to save America. We have had our two centuries of Glory. Read John Glubb’s Fate of Empires (easy to find on the web).

            I always thought Chris Hitchens was an amazingly talented writer. He had a head full of nutty ideas, but he could make his argument with a style and whit that few could match. Peter Hitchens is no slouch either. Mark Steyn is another extremely good writer. Steve Sailer is not an illiterate, just pedestrian. His copy often reads like an inter-office memo. That’s not intended as a criticism, just an observation. Sailer can also wander off point like in his current column. He gets lost in trivial details he has in his head. Steve has a head for trivia, but it makes for cluttered prose.It is about taste, of course.

        Political service should be like jury duty.  You get selected, you serve, you go home.

        “Most politicans in the “Western World” are lawyers”True, but it is important to note that they are all lawyers because all they can deal with is making laws and relating to other people who think the same way: if it’s not broke, think about making a law for it one day but if it is broke, then make ten laws for it at once.As the political class don’t have any frame of reference for people other than a “thou shalt not, or else” mentality it follows that is all they can do. Like all lawyers, they are only motivated by judgement and can only be persuaded by pleas and appeals, not by reality. As the world grows daily more complex then regulating or limiting how the ordinary people behave in it is all that matters.It’s called democracy: you vote for more laws, not leadership or care.

        Freeze time?  How about freeze spending?I would be more willing to agree to immigration if I didn’t have to support them all for the rest of their lives.  It costs about $5000 a month for a refugee immigrant.  Why should we pay for it?  It costs nearly as much for an illegal immigrant when you factor in all costs.  If immigration is so great they should be paying us.  I say freeze all legal immigration and visas; find and deport all illegals and until the legal immigrants all learn English and how to take care of themselves no new immigration, period.

        People like to rail about those who would run for office, yet have spent not a day in any type of government, as somehow unqualified. I’m pretty sure the Founders would be appalled at today’s political class, the way they run in the same circles, give each other the wink and a nod while they sell us all down the river to the highest bidder. I would rather have someone like Ben Carson, with zero political experience, who actually can articulate the problems the country is facing. I’m not sure he has any concrete solutions at this stage of the game, but identifying the problems is half the battle.
