        Partly out of a nostalgia for childhood and Sagan, I tried to make it through deGrasse’sCosmos.  I wandered off about halfway through.  He’s a third-rate sciencetainer, with a genuine talent for making hard work and brilliance look trivial and banal.
To put it another way:  I have a cherished copy ofThe Way Things Work, the 1967 edition, filled with wonderful, crisp line drawings and clear, concise text. It was and remains a joy to behold and you could probably rebuild a civilization with it.
deGrasse is the one with the goddam woolly mammoths.

        Neil deGrasse Tyson is for people who don’t want to think too hard about science because they can’t. I agree with UKer: the Moslem hordes produce nothing but strife and death. We can thank them for algebra and maybe some interesting architecture way back in the day, but they have produced nothing of value since then. And nothing deGrasse Tyson says is going to change that fact.

        As long as the left is pushing global-warming and lays claim to having a monopoly on ‘science’ they’ll keep him around.  Same with him being the patron saint of secular humanism.  As long as he’s promoting atheism and crapping on christianity he’ll stay in their good graces.
He did raise a slight kerfuffle when he promoted GMO foods – that would indicate that he has no idea that he’s being used and believes his own stuff.

        What’s interesting about Tyson is he seems to be unaware of what’s going on around him. He does not know he is an ornament. When the cult gets a new bauble, it will be interesting to see how Tyson handles being tossed aside. I could be wrong, but he does not look like a guy who has staying power.

        He did not look impressive in what I bothered to watch of his presentation. I would expect a so-called expert to have the gist of his argument embedded in mind over what he has to say rather than mumble he is catching up with himself and staring at his notes.I also don’t buy the fashionable idea that everything scientific is from Arabia. The tribes are routinely credited with many things, such as the invention of the zero, that were the product of other cultures they raided or borrowed. But even if they did some things, like coming up with a few dozen names, we can all be sure of one thing:The world of islam stopped doing anything of value around 1200 years ago and is darkly determined to continue not doing anything valuable now or in the future.What you see is what you get, and always will.

        I’ve caught him live at a work conference.  He is no doubt an engaging and charismatic speaker.
But his presentation was riddled with erroneous facts, and cheap straw man arguments.  He reminded me of one those revivalist tent preachers, or an infomercial host.
