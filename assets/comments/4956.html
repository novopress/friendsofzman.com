        Late comment:
“All they need is a few trillion more dollars from the taxpayers…”
Which is the real point of it all. Tapping into that sweet, sweet government loot.

        Electric cars use components that consume vast amounts of power to make, and disposing of them (as one day they must be disposed of) is costly and harmful. But don’t expect the enviroloons to know that. I mean, come on, you think they have actually thought about their obsession?I am reminded of life here in the UK with the proliferation of ‘wind farms’ which blight the landscape, provide little power (they have to be turned off if it is too windy), are sited politically (at the junction of two motorways near me there are several, just to remind the travelling peasants these eyesores exist) and cost a fortune to make and erect with the added bonus of a relatively short productive life so they can never repay the cost involved. Still, it doesn’t matter: the cost is born by the energy user and taxpayer and the enviroloons don’t understand we (and they) are all paying for this lunacy many times over.Oh, and they damage birdlife and kill bats. But not the bats who drool over wind farms, however.

        A couple of fairly obvious points:(1)The term ‘fan’ is a contraction of the word fanatic. And they are.(2)Electric cars don’t function efficiently unless the user lives in an environment where they actually don’t need a car. Then they work out fine. They’re public transportation V1.01

        “They are sure that electric cars powered by sunshine are…”
Yeah, that’s true, but right now, most of them are powered by coal or natural gas. Where do those moonbats think the electricity to charge them comes from?

        “… trait responsible for intense religiosity…” and  “… the promised land is just over the next hill or around the next bend.”This is a recurring theme here.  I think you are spot on.  I’ve thought for a long time that its rooted in Christianity, and Islam too, and farther back in ancient Bronze age belief, this discarnate longing, the Daemonic in nature, an insatiable desire, also known as Don Juanism.  The Religiously posited absolute other is nothing but an expression of Aristotelian geocentric cosmology.  Perfection is “above”, “beyond” the ken of fallen man. The source of guilt is man’s station, below the perfection of the Heavens – his estrangement; the parsing of Truth from the whole of Being, Reality, and fixing it in the “Heavens”.  Guilt is the source of fear, self-loathing, a “sickness unto death”. The infinite regress of dystopian dreams in which we are embedded is nothing but a fractalisation of that old Aristotle model of The Real. If nothing else we are eternally bound to this wheel whose spokes we hug and kiss, truly, a sickness unto death.
