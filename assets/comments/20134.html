        One thing to pay close attention to in the next fortnight — with the ever-swelling number of “lock down” states — is just how little your local, county and state police are actually there to “serve and protect”.  They exist to give butchy shrews, juiced up meatheads, and slimy bullies a make-work job.  Well remunerated, I might add.  They will defend their turf and their pensions with a passion.  Just as we see the state governors strutting around with their cocks out this week, law enforcement will relish the chance to ask for your papers.

            There were literally two supreme court cases about this. Police only have to protect those “in custody.” They literally have a constitutional duty to protect inmates from COVID-19 and NOT citizens from criminals.

                Ironically, many states have good Samaritan laws, which require people to render aid to those in trouble. In theory, you are required to call the police if you see someone being assaulted, but the cop is not required to respond.

                    I always thought that those laws are more in line of ‘you are not held liable if you attempt to help in good faith and do additional harm’. They actually *require* you to help when you may (for many reasons) be unable or unwilling?

                        I don’t know how many states have such laws, but yes, there are state laws that require people to render reasonable aid to those in trouble. Calling for help is enough, but in theory you could be charged with not doing it.

                        Yes, at least in some states, you are required to stop. As to the liability, I know a doc or two who, at least, claim that doctors have been sued. Now whether they have their facts straight or not, I can’t say.

                            Here as I understand, you can not be sued if you act in good faith.  However, consider such immunity in context of how the law is stated, i.e., acting in good faith is a defense.  Everyone can be sued.  In some cases, usually government, the suit can be quickly defended with a claim of sovereign immunity.Who are you sovereign of?  In other words, some yahoo can file suit and you must go to the trouble and expense of defense, on your dime, to plead/prove you acted under the statute.I suppose you could seek your expenses, but even an immediate judgement only means you have even more hassle to find the bastard’s assets and attach them. If he has any assets.I don’t remember any “Good Samaritan” cases here, but there are any number of civil suits wrt self defense with firearms—even when no criminal charges are presented.  Only people with $$$ get their justice in the court system.  The rest of us just keep our fingers crossed and stay away.

                    Doctors hate those laws. If they stop to help some guy who was hurt in an auto accident, they can get sued if anything goes wrong.

                    These extend in Germany to traffic accidents. You can get in trouble for driving past someone in distress. You have to know first aid to get your driver’s license, because you’re required to administer it if you see someone who needs aid on the road. This works better in Europe (or worked better in Europe, until recently) than in America for…demographic reasons.

                    And yet they usually do….I doubt the Cleveland Police are ignoring real threats, or real criminals.    They are ignoring bullshit, such calls come in.I’m not a cop, but as a soldier I understand and appreciate them.They don’t just bitch about things, they do something about it.As for the inanity of the laws; they don’t write them.   In many ways we do, or we do nothing about it.Now if you won’t run the risks, don’t criticize those who do.The new right is very tiresome, just whites who realize they’re rejected by the left, vilified yet for all the hype  you are deracinated and demoralized.   Waiting for collapse.A collapse is most unlikely.   What is likely is a change in government.For our government is a Front for Randian neoliberal looters, and lacking any self restraint will not last.As we don’t actually have Goths roaming about and the Minority Crime Lords Day has come and gone (that’s why we have so many cops and they’re so macho and militarized) then its a question of who.   Well who is turned to now?Soldiers, police.  At every crisis.Cuomo is demanding Trump invoke wartime powers; rather heedlessly.Which of course Trump could but he still has the same problem;  he just wants to be POTUS – and no, it won’t be enough.   He doesn’t want to be dictator.

                Police only have to protect those “in custody.”
It’s not the police’s job to protect people, except in the sense that they sequester criminals.
And to be frank, I wouldn’t want to live in a society where that was the case: it would require cops on every street corner, ready to “protect” citizens at seconds’ notice –  a total surveillance society.

                    I get what you are saying and agree that it’s a problem, but there are some pretty egregious examples.When cops shoot someone or even beat someone, there is a principle called “the totality of circumstances” and the “reasonableness” of their actions based on what a hypothetical “reasonable police officer” would do in a similar circumstance and also what they sincerely believed to be true at the time of the action.  So if they sincerely believed the ham sandwich in your hand was actually a machine gun and they shoot you in the back, their limited immunity kicks in. Despite what most people think, the police absolutely can shoot you in the back.Because they get this type of leeway to protect THEM from prosecution and lawsuits, we need to be able to use the concept of totality of circumstances to hold cops accountable when they show reckless disregard for the safety of those they are sworn and paid to protect.  As the law is right now, cops can watch a serious felony with a high risk of serious bodily injury and or death to the victim and do nothing and still be protected.

                        As the law is right now, cops can watch a serious felony with a high risk of serious bodily injury and or death to the victim and do nothing and still be protected.And that is right and proper, lest you want people suing the police for failing to protect them from every little altercation.The “serve and protect”-stuff is not to be taken literally, except as in protecting society (rather than the individual) by threatening criminals with repercussions and putting them away if they transgress.Protection from violence is – on a personal level – the duty of your fellow man, not (thank God!) of a government employee.It is the same misconception being duplicated when people talk about establishing militias to protecting themselves from poc aggression, since the police cannot: when the poc sees the militia, he is going to take his aggression elsewhere. This, as much as Commie pushback, ended the Soldiers of Odin in a few months: what’s the fun of being a militia, if all you do is wearing out your shoes and look ridiculous?Successful militias work much the same way as successful police: by instilling fear of retaliation:  you kill one of ours, we kill one of yours.

                            Felix nails the dilemma – allowing “failure to protect”  lawsuits = nogs suing every time they nog.  Might be workable in a civilized White society, like most things presently forbidden to reasonably free men.
If we were free to exercise self-defense, we could take care of the light work ourselves.
Under anarcho-tyranny, you can’t defend yourself legally AND you can’t sue the cops.  Lose-lose.

                                Your only hope is that in a community with some closeness to the police—usually smallish, the police will look the other way at the general populace actions to protect themselves.I’ve seen this first hand along the border in this sector.  Any number of civilian patrols work in concert with BP and local ranchers. Takes some time to build a relationship and one needs to respect boundaries, but there was never an adversarial turf war with groups I’m familiar with.  We were treated as any other enforcement group.  Data shared and even group coordination in efforts.  Just keep your mouth shut and get the job done.

                                Lose-Lose?  Unless one realizes that one might have to choose between law and civilization.I mentioned that in passing at dinner after some civilian firearms training at the Jeff Cooper school.  The striving bourgeois looked at bit confused, then went back to their dinner and discussing all the ways criminals can beat the system.And discussing their favorite pistol.🤣🤣.The ROE put this all nicely into sharp relief, being Iraq and all.As I always tell the other leaders in a quiet voice the law is behind me, holding it’s knife.  The Law chose this,  they seem to understand.Even the cops.   More than most.You see Sirs, if you lose the law…It’s win-win.   And trust me you feel much better about things.You’ll be your own man, and truly free.Put the law behind you, and don’t worry. Do what you must, indeed do what you should.  Then if arrested shut up and get a lawyer.  Let them do the lying, its much too degrading for the rest of us.   If you don’t confess your chances of escape grow exponentially.   Really.

                            If a cop shoots a guy wanted for having just shot 10 children, if he doesn’t render aid, he can be held liable for deliberate indifference. The totality of circumstances comes into play here.  If they are incapacitated from the shot, but still holding the gun, the totality of those circumstances protect the cop.To some degree, I think the concept of totality of circumstances could mitigate the insanity that could ensue from creating a duty to protect standard.You can’t run around screaming about how dangerous your job is and demand all these protections and creating policies that protect cops from some pretty outrageous behavior and then run away when there is a shooter in a school killing kids and have that be protected or to watch a felony in progress with deliberate indifference and have that also be protected.  At least have the ability to fire them.In some limited circumstances, cops can basically ignore dept policy (which also is what protects them), like if the dept is not enforcing the rule with enough vigor. Failure to enforce or failure to train or negligent retention can be brought up after a cop is fired or even arrested.Policing has become one big clownworld of stacking the deck.  Partially this happened because all of us, police included have to behave as if dealing with a 70yo grandmother has the same exact risk as dealing with a 20yo black male.  It is just one of the many hidden costs of diversity.

                    The landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in this regard is DeShaney vs. Winnebago County (often referred to as the “Poor Joshua” case). The father had legal custody of the child. The child was brought to a hospital and there was a report of abuse by the father. The county Dept. of Social Services (DSS) got a court order to keep the child in the hospital’s custody. At some point, the father regained custody but DSS continued to monitor the father. Although there was evidence of continued abuse, DSS took no action. Later, the child was severely abused by the father and suffered brain damage.The mother sued the county on the child’s behalf. The Supreme Court ruled that the state’s duty to protect arises from the limitation imposed by the state on a person’s freedom to act on his own behalf through incarceration or other restraint of personal liberty – which is the “deprivation of liberty” triggering the protections of the Due Process Clause, not the state’s failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means. So, no matter how badly the state may screw up in a case like this, there can be no liability on the part of the state because the victim was not deprived of his liberty (under arrest/incarcerated) by the state.

                        And if not for the Due Process Clause that is at times so lamented, the State would be arresting people for no reason right and left and holding them in jail.  Tragedies like this one happen, but it is the price we pay for not being subject willy-nilly to that midnight knock on the door.

            Yes and no. There are two valid sides to this. Yours – which you briefly and eloquently laid out – and theirs.Those guys risk life and limb when they respond to anything. They have to sort out domestic disputes where 99.9% of the time, it is a case of two idiots fighting and the smaller, weaker idiot losing. They have to stand by and let a corruption-infested judiciary undermine them at every turn. Those monsters in prison where not put there by jackbooted thugs and self serving politicos and judges. They were put there in spite of them. Most cops would rather see the prisoners get their necks stretched rather than be let out again.I personally am ambivalent; our judiciary is severely compromised and clearly amoral and indifferent to justice – and it can be successfully argued that they no longer do their jobs. That leaves us with two choices – vigilante justice or the law of the jungle. As the empire erodes, I can see both options appealing to different demographics – if ya get my drift.America is no longer what it once was. Could ending it be a good thing? In states like California… yeah, maybe so.

                Good point. I’d argue that Jungle Law has already existed a long time, primarily in our urban jungles where the, ah, “Natives” live. What else can you call a 50% homicide clearance rate? Meanwhile, idiocy like DeBlasio’s releasing presumably less-dangerous criminals early will of course only add to the criminals on the street. Is it the humanitarian thing to do? Not to the potential victims, I’d argue. Action such as this are, perhaps, the last gasp of a soon-to-die uber-Liberal worldview.Vigilante law is another thing; we are not at that stage (“yet”?) If it comes, that will most likely be the end of the USA as we know it. If you are civicly-minded, you may wish to lay in supplies of stout rope, in addition to ammuition, for difficult times ahead.

                Cops are not even in the top 10 most dangerous jobs.  The whole “every stop, every call could be one that sends you to your death” is so overblown that it’s comical.  This constant harping on “officer safety” has created a pervasive attitude of “us and them” with us being the cops and them being us pesky citizens.  Cops will beat the shit out of old women on video and are completely shameless about it. ALL in the name of “officer safety”Not only are cops not in the top 10 most dangerous jobs, the way cops get hurt is driving (AND they give us tickets for things they do as a matter of routine. They will ticket YOU for talking a cell phone, they operate computers at highway speeds).The cops are absolutely out of control. The cops are now strip searching people on the side of the road.  There is one incident up on YT where it appears you are watching a rape in progress and not a strip search. They literally throw a young girl on the ground, strip her, spread her legs and hold them spread while another cops sticks their fingers up her vagina.Cops are now routinely shooting dogs, even small dogs.

            One thing the libertarians get right are the Thin Blue Line bootlickers on the right need to be ruthlessly educated.  They are just as bad as the snitches who are calling the cops because they see people playing in a park during lockdown.
Trying to enforce anarcho-tyranny is much harder when everyone hates your guts.

                What libertarians get wrong is that they refuse to distinguish good cops from bad cops… or even acknowledge the difference exists. and more than a few dissidents are making the same mistake. Further, if you use the bad ones as an excuse to kneecap the good ones… welp, enjoy Lagos, fellas, because that is where you’re headed, and you will get exactly the law enforcement you deserve. I’m kinda thinking the libertarians in Cincinnati will get the law enforcement they always wanted – good and hard. It’ll serve them right too.

                Sure.
All I’m hearing is the police have the power.   Politics is Power.Why would any politically minded man on the right not consider Being a cop?
And the police aren’t enforcing anarcho-tyranny; that’s the Fat black women in HR.   The police are too busy arresting her brother.
And its really no problem enforcing anything if you don’t care about being hated, and are willing to use force.

            2 generations ago every car would have stopped, every male attempted to help, every woman to assist the wounded and to watch over every terrified child…and the young boys would have dragged the broken car parts to the roadside.  In two generations we’ve replaced this with legalisms and not wanting to get involved or getting one’s hands dirty.  Progress.

                3 Generations more like  , maybe a bit less.Economic mobility destroys society.When you know you are going to live in one location, work there, marry there and stay married there , go to church there and very possibly your kids will do the same, you have an incentive to build a reputation as a good citizen.Hell in Mama Proper’s day she was able to borrow a large sum of money b  what we’d call a signature loan now on her grandfathers good name and repaid every penny of it, That name still carries weight as does scores of years later.However modernity deselects for that .On top of that screen time and diversity breeds introverted and anti social people who would ordinarily  be friendly and social/Its not repairable as far as I know. Vast sums of money are spent to addict people to these services and no way short of some kind Pol Pot Lite can it be changed.Either people drop out of the grid as much as they can or the natural consequences of this society will end it and some semblance  of normality will return.

                    One of the changes that I’ve seen in my lifetime, and I’m 65 years old, is the segregation of economic classes. I grew up in the central city of a midsize Midwestern metropolis. In my middle-class part of town the gamut ran from upper middle class to lower middle class. In my neighborhood there was one little section that was called “pill hill” which is where the doctors lived, or at least that’s what people said. In the rest of the neighborhood we had mostly middle-class blue and white collar types, my dad was an accountant, he was probably on the upper end of the middle middle class. The point of my rambling is that we all lived together, And who knows maybe I’m remembering things that never happened, but there was a sense that what went on in the neighborhood was of interest to everyone who lived there. We knew the cops in our neighborhood, and they knew us- and  if we were doing something that we weren’t supposed to there were both formal and informal ways  to deal with it. Adults had no hesitation about correcting kids that were mis-behaving, whether it was their kid or not. And it seems like a small thing but every Sunday in the summertime in the park across the street from my house there was a neighborhood softball game, in which the laborers, plumbers, accountants, and yes doctors, and the kids all played. All in all a more civilized society, which is mostly gone.

                        I appreciate the story.Where I grew up, an exurb, we didn’t really  notice classes since everyone was basically working or middle.  There were poor people I was one of them but it wasn’t much of gap.You can blame free trade and automation as well as female entry into the work force fr the decline.Frankly the years from 1973 onward (measure by fertility rate here, it dropped below replacement the year) have been increasingly bad.Restoring the US may not be possible without great difficulty if at all.Making the US work to the benefit of the extended family and the American people requires the State and its authority used to that end,The Left being into collective action, collective responsibility and visions all BAMN (by any means necessary) gets that and  has a hue advantage on the Right who only seem to value “the individual.” these days and are  so cucked by Libertarians its hard to get any but the religious cranks to  even realize that you need to run government your way to get anywhere.Their problem of course is the Lefts ideas are often bad and are so emotion driven that controlling that terrible fire of State is just not possible.In essence, its White  tradition and a controlled nationalist  state that would make  America, well America and getting that will be a challenge.

        It may be the end times but it isn’t from Covid19, its the Clownpocalypse if anything, shutting entire economies down will do FAR more damage and for a longer period than this virus. But in the feminized nanny state clown world, what else did we expect? Anarcho-tyranny is on the rise and is the likely endgame. Start familiarizing yourself with it and get the word out. You will be severely punished for minor infractions while ‘diversity’ will be free to run wild. Clownpocalypse Now.

            A lot of guys seem to be picking fights with the paleocons lately, not that the PC’s haven’t thrown their share of bricks either.  Another spasm of the eternal Team Optics vs. Team WYSIWYG debate.  The Groypers have caused hope to spring eternal in the breasts of some PC’s – a child shall lead them.  It’s the first bright light in their tunnel since Pat Buchanan’s win in New Hampshire, long before Nick Fuentes was born.  I’ll pull a lot of punches criticizing guys who’ve been that starved for Good News for that long.

        You seem awfully confident this is a test run. I’m not so sure. I think it’s a controlled collapse. The United States as we knew it, even in its post-1965, post-2001, post-2008 successively diminished forms, is no more. The people are subject now to the rule of petty kings, with no recourse to the law. We all know that freedoms taken or not returned. They’ve pretty much reeled in the entire bill of rights with this one, and beyond.

            If this is a test run, the Globalists have got to be tickled pink at how well it has gone.
-Almost total compliance-Dissident voices shouted down-Zero civil disobedience-people who loudly proclaim “I don’t believe the Liberal Media” parroting said media’s line at every turn
I didn’t always think that people believe whatever they see on TV.  The get-together in the park in Virginia three summers ago disabused me of that notion, and this has really demonstrated how far they can push those boundaries.

                Meme, I don’t think we’ll get a true read unless/until this kind of shutdown is more protracted.  They’ve managed to ride the tiger when it’s a little cranky. but extend this kind of disruption over a few months and you’d see more [redaction].  This thing has only lasted long enough to put us in the denial stage of grief.  Stretch this into May-June and you get to anger.
Let’s not write Ms. Corona-Chan off just yet – I have a feeling she has a few more moves to make, and I’m not sure we’ve seen the last of her.

                            Welp, I will go ahead and predict that we see the number of new cases decline after about April 10th or so. Then there will be a push to open things up again. In the fall, the virus will come back and we will have another panic. Trump will shut it all back down, declare himself dictator for life and begin rounding up the usual suspects. OK, that last sentence was just lock down talking. I stand by the rest.

                                Yep, we should be near the peak or just on downside by ~April 10 if you follow what’s been happening in other countries. But they’ll hold the lockdown in place until the number fall dramatically so another week or two, so we’re looking mid to late April for people to start going back to work.
However, a lot of schools have been cancelled for the year so that will hold things back.
Regardless, the question is whether the economy will be able to “snap back” after that long of a period of time. I have no idea.

Like a recently deceased body; the hair and nails continue to grow for a time. The US petro-dollar is in the hair/nails stage. There will be no economy to bounce back outside the realm of make-believe. The Plan-demic is the perfect cover story.

                    Round my way, a week and a half or so after the governor ordered bars and restaurants closed, there are signs of life. It was a ghost town on Monday. Today there was a decent amount of traffic, people on the sidewalk.  I think there was enough heat on the gov (or outright defiance) to make him back off a little. My company got a waiver for instance, and by the looks of it we weren’t the only one.  Still no bars or restaurants. I feel for those folks.Granted I don’t live in a major city, but I’m encouraged by what I’ve seen. Then again, it could be as simple as people realizing this is going to hit them in the pocketbook.

                If you were in charge, what would you do?The 5% fatality rate  of this nasty disease isn’t doomsday  but its up to 10 million dead at 2/3rds infection rate and another 30 million seriously ill.Throw in the inevitable economic toll when businesses shut down anyway and the collapse of our lousy health care system and you have a recipe for screwed blued and tattooed. Oh and I used the expression without seeing it below and not a Devil Dog. Its just something I picked up or maybe part of Proper family argot.The lousy measures might mitigate it and so are probably the best call.Reasonable people  tend to comply with orders an epidemic. And yes its an epidemic when we hear about the problems day and and day out from doctors and people we know personally  at least online about how bad it is.Even so  people are far from compliant in California or Florida . The Cali Governor was urging people go home and stay off the beaches as of a few days ago. He had to block the parking lots.In Florida spring break went on just fine.This is stupid but its rather American.That said a few weeks of work from home is like a mini staycation  for many people and an opportunity to learn how to cook, how to parent and to play catch up on skills.That said the mayhem will come after, either after a recovery stalls or if/when round two kneecaps the nascent recovery and people feel they are screwed.Other than too hard a power grab, a rebellion is unlikely though simply because no one knows how to even pretend to do it better and this includes the dissidents.If we could magically fill every elected seat with a dissident and than declare martial law , our team couldn’t fix anything.We know what needs to be done, mostly (divorce reform, immigration ban and various economic measures)  but good luck with implementation. You need to be Stalin basically till you get your way and God help you if you are wrong, you get to  be Pol Pot instead.

                    AB.  Your model and fatality rates are incorrect.  It’s just that simple.  You are not absolved of crashing the economy because your intentions were good.What would I have done?  Well, if I were a successful politician, just about the same as currently has been done—because I’d be an ignorant, spineless, simp—incapable of thoughtful leadership and too stupid to understand when the data is incomplete and advice from those so called “experts” is based on modeling and data which are both inaccurate and incomplete.  And that’s aside from an inability to even understand that all economic choices involve trade offs, yes even trade offs of human life—both with action, and inaction.We are seeing this entire fiasco unravel before our very eyes, yet you seem to be buying the narrative, just assuming we were lucky that we didn’t have to start up open pit cremations.  The reality is that this whole Corona-Chan thing was never what it was claimed to be and the data was never there to justify our present predicament.

                        I’m hearing a lot of different information from a lot of people and frankly I tend to agree with the people out there in the field  who are saying this almost certainly  will get really really bad,I’ll use an example here, someone on our side, Aesop the Raconteur is pretty close to Dissident Right (Militia Right but less Libertarian)  who  works at (his words) Americas busiest hospital , has studied epidemiology and he is saying “we are humped”http://raconteurreport.blogspot.com/2020/03/pull-pin-fall-on-grenade.htmlthe TL;DR is “we won’t have a healthcare system.” which means things that would normally be manageable become a death sentence.Africa level mortality for decades and decades. Oh and unlike Africa, very low fertility.And yes the economic damage is horrendous   but we have no real alternative.I’ve  listened plenty of other Doctors, read reports, read medical papers and anecdotes, read from people, I know how sick they are and have concluded “Yep its serious, not just a flu”You are free to disagree but frankly there is no good alternative  to what we are doing. We MIGHT be able to get a handle on this and fix things later. Do nothing, put commerce first and lose 20% of the population or more , 5-10% do to CV plus millions of others dead to cancer, injury, and every other damned thing and have a nearly impossible to recover medical system since we don’t have drugs made here and many medical personnel  have noped working or diedAnd yes I know we could have done better. The US has a 2nd world level of corruption. Its simply not possible to allocate resources while lobbyists  rule the roost and with a diverse nation.Truth is we need one of our guys to declare martial law and fix the real issues but we aren’t out there and  so what the President the governors and the private sector  are doing as sucky as it is, well have to suffice.The critical issue comes when we try to reboot the economy. That is the real challenge.Bungle  this and your risks are higher than the virus.

                            America at any one time has about 200,000 empty hospital beds. Currently, we have 10,000 people with the plague needing hospital care. If a 5% change in the number of people needing hospital care has knocked out our health care system, we were fucked a long time ago. We just never noticed.

                                We basically are fucked. Our health care is expensive and substandard do to  misallocation  of resources. Its about as good as Italy, maybe a bit less.Normally I avoid national Review like it was Covid 19 but this article  shows how dire our hospital situation is and note without quarantine could get much worsehttps://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/a-hard-look-at-the-remaining-hospital-capacity-across-america/TL;DR its really bad.I don’t know if crashing the economy was the right thing to do but its understandable and might have been a good decision.Truth is the US desperately needs new management, one that isn’t old, half senile, corrupt and/or only concerned with lining their own pockets.It also needs to put the US and its people first but so long as nonsense like crap like citizens united is tolerated, its not gonna happen.All you can do is take care of your own, try and fix things which will almost certainly fail and as Ol Remus over at the Woodpile Report likes to say “Avoid Crowds”

                                    AB, let’s hope you are as ready to post and admit your error in two weeks as you are to post FUD.  As to your sources, get ones with an opposite view.  Here’s one to read from Stanford:https://hotair.com/archives/allahpundit/2020/03/17/stanford-prof-coronavirus-may-less-deadly-think-mild-justify-aggressive-countermeasures/Original ref’s in the article.  More like this person can be found all over the Internet—if you look for them.BTW:  No where does one deny there is a disease and that people die from such.  Only that the effect is way overblown, the “cure” much more risky than the disease, and that an adequate cost/benefit analysis has never been made of the actions taken by “leadership”.People like you keep posting fear and panic without considering any of the above.  The more FUD you hear, the more you react.  Exactly as those who wish to lead you through your emotions want.

                                        Hell I could be wrong, who knows.I’m reading plenty of “oh shit” articles and anecdotes from medical professionals in the field to be extra cautious.More import than the virus kills which may be low  is the spillover effect on the hospital system. Its under capacity, under sourced and brittle. Many people still have no health care to speak of.On top of that our medicine and its precursors are not made here and running out.Capacity and lack of supplies since not made here will kill a lot of people.And note the key article the guy in the article is “the point is to declare that we just don’t have enough of it yet to feel confident about how dangerous the disease is.”You don’t have time to waste with a virus and  while this shutdown will be bad,. the health care capacity needs to be preserved.In any case, if you were POTUS or a governor of NY or Cali what would you do?As to the economy, the Trump recovery isn’t. Its a reprieve.The US economy is hostage to global banks and configured like a very bad 3rd tier nation.1% all the gains 9% break even 90% hosed.I ran the least “screwed on wages vs cost to have good life cost to thrive” index I could find was the midwest and it was predicated on having a job in the rust belt. If you do, your wages relative to the boomers only declined 30%This doesn’t include higher taxes though.That is what needs to be fixed and maybe a little accelerationism, pushing people into cooking/eating at home, not buying crap they don’t need  and homeschooling will be a good thing.I do greatly worry about people’s incomes but worse times make better people and a more traditional life you know with families eating together, at least if they can pry the phones away is better for everyone.

                                Funnily enough, national patient capacity and sustainable loads (my own words here since I forget the technical nomenclature) was discussed as a nasty problem in the event of nuclear war with Russia…back in the ‘50s and especially ‘60s. Wasn’t a pretty picture, as I recall, and made even more nasty as the nuclear conflicts were seen as “winnable” and thus civilian casualties numbers were conservative.

                                    Forever.  It’s never a pretty picture because it is never efficient to keep such stock piles of supplies laying around for an unlikely and unknowable (resource-wise) emergency.
The best resource is a strong and vibrant economy that can react to such an emergency by production/direction of specific national resources as the emergency dictates.  That of course is the very resource that we are now destroying.

Our economy is about as vibrant as a grey mat.Until we reclaim the real economy we will be vulnerable to a nation that hates us and a wholly owned subsidiary of international bankers

                                            There’s a better way to fix the economy than just sitting on our asses at home as we sink deeper into financial stagnation. Worse, joblessness is horrid for the soul, and indefinite quarantine is not kind to the psyche. For better or for worse, life needs to continue.

                                                Fixing anything requires removal of the current political elite, top to bottom. Maybe this can be done via a slow slog through the electoral process, I sure hope so but until the DR and its allies have real power, no change is possible.We had might as well be at home for all the good it does.Now to be fair I’m an introvert and frankly  other than  not being able to  visit the bookstore   have barely noticed the quarantine since I avoid public everything by long habit.Hell I have probably gone out more than usual to get needed this and that to finish preps.That said I agree with you about joblessness at least for some and for quarantine, even in this age of screen junkies it does take a toll. I don’t know how to balance these issues (safety, freedom, economy, disease)  myself which is fine since I’m not in charge   and if I had been, the US would have a decent health care system and wouldn’t have much in the way of imports or visitors and as such would not have been effected.

            I don’t know about whereyoulive, Mr.Lamar (why anyone would take Mirabeau B. Lamar as his patron saint is beyond me) but in Texas these county wide lockdowns are pursuant to a Texas law passed in 1975 and having criminal penalties of fines not exceeding $1,000 and/or incarceration not exceeding 180 days attached. Any licensed Texas Peace Officer may enFORCEsuch diktats and under Texas law, even if thereasonEXCUSEfor an arrest is utterly invalid, resisting arrest is still a felony.

                    The seeds of local tyranny were planted in most cities a good while back under Public Health – communicable diseases ordinances.I remember when we were all going to die of the HIV so they figured out the vectors, made lotsa charts, and issued stay-at-home orders and other behavioral modification laws to flatten the curve. Lol!The fines are under $1,000 to keep them in the misdemeanor camp but as pointed out, resisting instantly escalates into Felony.What constitutes resistance? Well there you go.Its not about the fine as much as the law is a shoehorn of police powers that once breeched cascade into circumvented due process, detainment, and imprisonment.This little hook of forced compliance is at the heart of A-T.The other side of the coin is how crimes under $1,000 will not be prosecuted and adjudicated. They simply accumulate like parking tickets.So here’s to $1,000. Or is it $1,200?

        The American Empire will continue to fade…but America itself?  It seems much to volatile to slowly drift off into oblivion. If our very serious demographic problems didn’t exist then maybe.  But competing racial groups are a lot more volatile than were the competing cultural groups of Rome.  Even if we separate, a border between Switzerland and Italy can be manageable but a border between Switzerland and Liberia or Jalisco will boil over.  We can probably add to that maybe 20% of whites who are hardwired anti-whites. They will be a lot more destructive and dangerous than any coalition of non-whites.  We will fade while dealing with these problems. That’s inevitable.  The violence may be in fits and starts and take years to resolve itself…or it may rage on nonstop until one side is the clear winner.  Once that cork is pulled it will probably ratchet up a lot more quickly than we expect.  Racial tensions have been on the rise for some time.

            YY, this is a big reason why I’m absolutist re: 110’ing the Chosen on a long timeline. In a post-American low-trust environment, we’re going to have all the trouble we can handle just dealing with genuine GoodWhites, much less FellowWhite shapeshifters.

        Your reference to how Roman Spain came apart is apropos. Another thing to realize is just how long it took for the Roman Empire to fall. The process required at least 300 years to unwind. The wealthy Roman landed aristocrat in his villa was transformed in this period to the eventual Germanic warrior in his walled manorial system, in some cases still living in the old, crumbling Roman structure. (Infeudiation came in the ninth century after Charlemagne.) It is a fascinating transformation, and one that will inevitably be repeated here, though in a hybrid , hi-tech/low-tech version. Some areas will remain calm and civilized, while others will resemble Road Warrior.I was watching billionaire Paul Tudor Jones pontificate on a business channel this morning. His type will presumably step into the void left by anarcho-tyranny by bringing order and prosperity to a region he can control with his wealth and influence, probably in a state where he owns a large piece of land. I can see law enforcement falling under the power of the wealthy who can then control the population by extending or withdrawing protection. It’ll be a carrot and stick operation.

            One thing – what will the rich pay the cops with? Fiat money will be useless and since most of the rich man’s wealth is in bullshit intangibles. When the system collapses so does their wealth.Worse there is nothing stopping the cops or goons from simply killing the rich man and taking his swag. As Clinton said there is “no controlling legal authority” to say no to them.BTW this is the situation every rich prepper faces. They know if they bring armed guards with them  there is nothing stopping said guards in post-collapse situation from killing themThe way I see it, the only way the wealthy could survive the transition is to have a system set up now.  IOW They’d buy up towns in the rust-belt, refurbish them, Set up factories and shops to local production. Buy a coal power power plant(he who has the lightening calls the shots).A Ford, Carnigie or Rockefeller type could swing it. Todays rich who view Americans as scum could never do it. Our monied elite are mostly sociopathic destroyers like Romney  Zucky and Bezos.

                Payments and transactions will be made in tangibles. That can be pre64 silver or a dozen eggs or the labor of putting a new roof on your house. Just the way it always was and will be again. Green paper is just like Santa, at a certain point you stop believing in it. I and many more every day have already stopped. The balancing act is how to discern when the time has come to divest oneself of the last vestiges of fiat? I suspect that day will be when my mechanic or local farmers market will politely refuse a wad of dead presidents as payment.

        The releasing of the prisoners clinched it for me. I’m going to start learning Polish. I’m of the age where I want to start having kids in about 5 years and no way in hell am I going to raise them in a country that thinks it’s a good idea to releases hordes of feral apes in a time of crisis. The placidity of the normies is fucking breathtaking.

            Better apply for a residency permit right now. I bet the Visegraders will very soon be fed up with Western refugees sitting in their expat clubs, spending their savings on cheap beer while kvetching about the local food, local weather and local customs, pining for the Old Country.
Poc or not, mass immigration will inevitably be resented – just look how fed up the British are with the Poles.

                It’s an incredibly hard language to learn, I doubt too many others would try to emigrate there. I don’t have any savings I’m in my 20s, I would work, maybe as an english teacher. And I don’t have any fondness for American customs, I was born a minority white in SoCal, I have no place where I am from. I am from the mall of America. I have always been an outsider, so there will be no pining.

                    I am so sorry you never got to experience the real America.  Older Americans let you down terribly by letting it slip through their grasp from World War II onward.  Actually, the slippage began with the Civil War, but it really accelerated after 1945.  We Are The World, and all that

                        Meh, can’t miss what I’ve never experienced. Thanks though, I appreciate the sentiment. I don’t blame boomers, my own generation is pretty shitty too. If I had one wish it would have been for the moving picture to never have been invented. Hyperreality melted everyone’s brains I think. How did they get all that crap done in the 60’s? Media driven narratives fooled everyone, people’s reality is defined by the inputs they receive. As much as we think we know it’s fake it still effects our perceptions of reality. It’s one of the reasons I like Poland, state runs much of their media and the gov’t with a super majority is right wing. I can only hope they don’t ever let the tribe in to subvert it.

                    FashGordon, I decamped from Britain to E.Europe 2 years ago. I have never regretted my decision. However, while it is generally a lot cheaper here than anywhere in the West, it can be very difficult for a foreigner to get a job, unless you speak the language to an advanced level.
My advice is that you try to find a way to work remotely, so that you can earn your money from the USA while living anywhere.

                    I wish you the best of luck. Your age is definitely an asset, but be advised that no matter how well you assimilate, the locals are probably never going to consider you a real Pole. This is not to say they’ll ostracize you or that you can’t have a good life there, but in most ethno-nat countries there’s a subtle, social glass ceiling: you’ll never be truly part of the tribe, although your children probably will, if you raise them Polishly.If I were you, I’d shop around a bit, live a few months in each country and try to find the place that best suits your temper before you decide. Poles have a reputation for being parochial and somewhat ornery, maybe Hungary or Czechia is more your thing?

                        You both give good advice, I have considered those things. Don’t have that much money and in the process of finishing a Bachelors so while I’d love to spend months surveying the various cultures I’m not sure that’s a practical option. I’d look the same but maybe always have at least a hint of an accent. It’s alright though, there is no community here anyway so being seen as somewhat of an outsider wouldn’t be anything I’m not used to. The teaching job idea is sort of a stepping stone idea, I would be able to get a feel for the environment and make enough to get by on. I could also visit other places cheaply during holiday periods. I like Poland the best from what I can glean from the outside so I’m going to at least begin learning the language while i finish my degree here. I’m parochial and somewhat ornery so I think I might fit in well haha.

                            I understand that you don’t have months to spare, but I do recommend a visit, if only for a few days. Get the feel of it. If Poland interests you, then you could do a lot worse than visiting Krakow – wonderful city. You should also consider Prague or Budapest.

                            Fash, I’ll agree and amplify Felix – I went to Europe expecting to like Russia more than Scandinavia b/c muh genes.  After experiencing both over four months or so, I’m on Team Valkyrie.  Team Natasha is a somewhat distant 2nd now.  The social ceiling Felix mentions feels much lower and thicker in Russia than Denmark, Norway or Sweden.  Pretty sure that applies the further East one goes.

I think we had a fragment of this conversation a few months ago, where I asserted that, regardless of their positive qualities, in general the Slavs are Not Us. Also, Nordiska in its various flavors are much easier for English speakers to learn than Russian.
(Nordiska as in generic nordish Germanic. Finnish is a humbling nightmare.)

                                    Agree, Mike – there’s an extra degree of separation there.  In fairness to my Grandma’s peeps, America suffers by comparison to Norway and Denmark in many ways.  They’re a tough act to follow.

                            Move to Montana or Wyoming, don’t trouble your mind with silly expatriation ideas. You are an American far deeper than you think.As far as blaming others for not doing anything about the increasing poz, ask yourself why you want to run away from it rather than fight.

                                I never blamed others for not doing anything. Didn’t mean to anyway, after all I am part of us, some of us are at least trying and nothing I have done has stopped anything either. I wish staying made sense, but with current events as they are, it seems like whats happening right now is that the little of what’s left of small and medium non pozzed businesses will be crushed to dust, leaving only corporate globohomo financially solvent. They will snap up whats left at bargain basement prices with fake money printed and distributed by the fed. The hallowing out of small town America will enter it’s final stages, and there will be nowhere else to go for work but the diverse megalopolises of present and future dystopia. I really hope I’m wrong, and if I am then I won’t have to go but I am not living the rest of my life in pozzcity. If people actually find the will to do something I will join them with great fervor, but if not, if tepid acquiescence is all the population can muster in the face of annihilation then I don’t see much point in huddling together as the ship sinks. Anyway I’m not leaving immediately. And like I said, I’ve always been an outsider, I’m used to being a novelty. I think I’d prefer being the only American in the room to the being only white man though.

                    The best “English” teacher I had was a German.  He taught German, but was also fluent in Latin and Greek, English and I suspect everything else.  In short, just speaking/teaching English, to me means nothing if you are not fluent in the native language of those whom you are teaching a second language.  I’m not trained in this area however, just my impression.  But I’ll never forget this guy.  He taught me more about my native language as a foreigner than I ever was taught in K-12 by so called Americans.

                Felix, I was living in London when the Polish influx arrived and I never witnessed or detected any complaints about them at all. Most Brits that I knew were fine with it.There may have been some grumbling about the Poles from certain quarters but, in my opinion, that was a displacement activity because they were not allowed to complain about the influx of vibrancy.

                Sure, but unlike them I don’t care about money so much, and I’ve grazed on the grass here in the west, it ain’t greener. Quality of life is what I’m after. And the answer to that question is none. Maybe northern Idaho, a few other places, but long term… America is a sinking ship. I’ve looked into it, every place that is still nice is currently in the process of being made not nice. Myriad NGOs have been hard at work to make that nightmare a reality. On top of that we are almost certainly in for some wicked hyperinflation in the coming years. Recent events have set the wheels in motion to greatly hasten the decline.

                    If you have never lived in one place in another country for an extended period of time (multiple months or longer), it is hard to understand what you are getting into.  You will be an island of one, and you will find that spending time with other expatriate “yanks” becomes a big deal.  Maybe not quite as much, post-Internet, as now you can get your fixes in places like this.Communities matter, and you will have none, wherever you move to in another country.  You will meet friendly people, who will treat you like a bit of a novelty.  But people in most places will not open up to you, and will wait for you to move along, as Americans in other places are expected to do.

            Fash, don’t give up yet.  There are still a lot of places in the US that are 95% white at a minimum.  If you live along Hwy 90, except for a few large urban areas you will not see many non-whites (excluding Pow-wow Indians).  A lot of America is still very very very white. Some of those areas are as big as Poland if not bigger. In a lot of those places a home is cheap as is land.  It’s still a place you can raise a family and have a career. With a few acres you can have a sideline as a small farmer.  If you have to work for a few years in a city to make more money do it.  When you have enough to buy something in the country and enough seed money to start something else you’ll be 1000x better off than your contemporaries.As things decay here the government will become a lot more draconian but they will lack the wherewithal to implement it, especially in largely white areas.Good Luck to you.

                True, the possibility exists that I might find some slice of real America left and be able to live out my life there in relative comfort. But what about my progeny? What about theirs? I don’t see how this country doesn’t turn into a complete shitshow in the coming decades, to the extent that it isn’t already. Something cataclysmic would have to take place, and I’m not much of a gambler. Never once in my life have I bought a lottery ticket. I look at math, I look at statistics, I look at trends and patterns, and none portend anything good.

        This whole situation is like some weird science fiction movie.  I thought we might have hit bottom a couple days ago, but the our “ruling class” seems hell bent with “the pedal to the metal”.Not to unreasonably inject politics, this seems to be the culmination of the periodic hysterias (e.g., Russia Probe, Stormy Daniels, Kavanagh, Jussie Smollett, impeachment).  The nihilistic media seems willing to do anything to bring down Trump (and I am no big fan of the Orange Man), even if it means bringing down the country.There is definitely an air of radical chic (excluding Ann Coulter and Heather MacDonald) female hysteria to this.That people are told to stay at home means more time in front of the TV instead of dealing with the outside world.  As such, the whole mechanism seems to be self-reinforcing.I tried to communicate with an elite educated lady by sending the following article by a Yale professor in the New York Times talking about a systematic approach.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.htmlThe response I received was that “he must be a Trump supporter” (as if Yale and the New York Times are MAGA enclaves) without addressing the substance of any issue.From my personal experiences, I get more logic and common sense from a typical “Person of Color” than many educated whites.Thanks once again to the Z-Man.

                The person of whom I mentioned is a regular CNN watcher.  I was trying to use the article as a disguised red pill.  Any time I see CNN on a TV screen, I get goose bumps.  CNN is a threat to domestic order and harmony and reasonably could be viewed as a public health problem.  I have a Trumpian family member with a CNN spouse and that hugely disruptive.  Best of luck to you.

        I think the most possible outcome has been delineated these last couple decades by James Howard Kunstler in his “World Made by Hand” books. Regarding the cities, and their highly-populated and diverse urban centers, no dystopian scenario is too hyperbolic, and they will be doomed, basically Aleppo but with a rap music soundtrack. Most of what we think of as suburbs are really just what the new Urbanists called “Nodes,” fake mansions (the Germans call them matchstick houses, we call them McMansions) with a fake pastoral, bucolic feel and pretentious “Shire”-based names. These places will probably be abandoned and left to rot (sort of like in 2008, but permanently). Upstate locations in the Midwest, Upstate New York, the Alleghenies, portions of Kentucky will transition toward something people recognized as civilization from about the 18th century to the early 20th, with hydroelectric power and churches and rudimentary medicine. I can live with the kinds of older liberals who live in these kinds of places, even-keeled Ken Burns/Garrison Keillor-types, but there will have to be some hard-asses since all our old friends from the prisons and the ghettos will steamroll over our retrofitted civilization unless there are some mean people in our own ranks. I don’t know enough about the South to even wildly speculate (Neo-Confederacy, hopefully), or the Plains states and New Scandinavia (which might be in trouble, since they’re close to Canada and there are some wacky white progressives in the Cheddar Belt/ New Somalia). We have been cursed/blessed to live in interesting times.

            Yeah, watch out for Canada. We are in the process of creating a shithole of epic proportions.
Would China try to take over? Probably. But we couldn’t even be taken over by a foreign power: the Indians, Pakistanis, Africans, Koreans, our whole “mosaic” would never let that happen.
I don’t know if we would become a patchwork of ethnostates – or if one group would get the upper hand and just wipe everybody else out. Disaster.

                UFO, some of our guys are looking at vast, mostly empty Western Canada as a good place to set up our own communities on the down-low.  That border’s a lot longer and more porous than Mexico’s and where there’s a White, there’s a way.  You’re welcome to stop by for a beer once they get settled.

                    Certainly will. Hell I’ll move out there if there’s something set up.
Are you in Western Canada as well? I’m stuck in southern Ontario and they’ve flooded everywhere with Indians… even smaller cities and towns. The real small towns are white but there’s no jobs and mostly drug addicts.
I don’t see why Western Canada would be any different they’re just behind the curve a bit.

                        SoCal now, working my way north.  I’ll be lurking near your border all summer, some combo of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.  I have old friends who live in Calgary.  Considering 80% of the Leaf populace lives within 200 miles of the border, there should be some elbow room left and most pozzed Canadians seem to focus on their urban hellscapes.

                    Some kind of new polity, a right wing  populist nationalist , implicitly Christian and expansive alliance wouldn’t be that bad or when the implosion that hard to make happen.Problem is it would be landlocked and resource constrained with terrible weather and limited agrarian land which is not an enviable  position.Ultimately though it will come to war, probably ethnic and religious and casualty rates in millions, high percentages.Upside if you make it out or at least your line does, you get a decent nation out of it.Stay nuclear if you can though, its the only way to true security.

                Yeah, all true, but I don’t judge an intellectual by whether or not they correctly predict the future (we have fortune tellers for that). I judge them by whether or not they can diagnose what’s currently wrong. Kunstler’s the second most succinct person in America after Pat Buchanan when it comes to pointing out what’s wrong with the culture, finance, the political class, etc. Yes, he’s a Boomer and Tribe Member but if Charley Pride can sing country music I can live with Kunstler as an honorary white (like Ron Unz).

                    Awwww, joey.  Give Charley a break.  He is one of the greatest bona fide country singers to ever come down the pike.  He’s a part-owner of the Texas Rangers.  Anyone who hangs out with Nolan Ryan Ain’t All Bad.  He’s assimilated into Anglo-Saxondom while never goin’ above his sharecropper’s son raisin’.   And he’s non-PC.  When asked how it felt to be a country music success as a black American, he replied, “Same as it did when I was colored.”Let’s do this.  If Taylor Swift, who wouldn’t know a steel guitar if it fell on her, can ever have been deemed a country singer.Cheers.

            If I recall, Kunstler was the gentleman that predicted doom before the Y2K computer code crash, and then “Peak Oil” in the mid-2000’s, and now he is a prophet of the latest financial doom.  Not that he is wrong in this case, but I take his prognostications with a grain of salt.

                    Not much.Around here in Cali rationing is handled by the private sector and the shelves have most stuff even at the big box retailers. Mostly normal.The only thing that is hard to come by is toilet paper and sanitizer which still goes out quick. We expect plenty is a few weeks.  We have plenty of food  and variety of such also.On the whole, limiting store entry at least at the big boxes  made shopping far more pleasant and made it take less time too even with a slight wait out front.Most of us are enjoying the break and honestly many don’t care if this becomes a regular policy.The queue time is less than the normal line time as funny as that sounds.There is a HUGE caveat, this shutdown is going to create a massive depression or at best a massive recession.A lot of businesses  aren’t going to weather this very well and even the ones that are open aren’t doing well.This means massive unemployment , business closure sand this can lead to a very bad outcome even with a short quarantine.The long term effects may be much less consumerism as people realize they don’t need much stuff or to eat out , go out since money is limited and less people are employed.This will have serious spillover effects  effects and the time frame for a road to recovery is limited.Fail there and whoever succeeds President Trump probably in 2024 will make FDR look like Rand Paul .

                Speaking of hero’s. I’m seeing a lot of “thank you for your service” to doctors and nurses. Support our nurses! Ribbons on trees yet to come but the pattern is revealing.
They are getting their 15 minutes. (Plus time and a half). I wonder if they will come to sour on the mantra like so many of the Vets.
But this new forever war is looking up. The great goat-patch grift of AfghanIraq took almost three decades to burn $6T.
Took us three weeks to get to that with the war on ChinaVirus.

                    Medical professionals at the lower level will most likely get some (deserved) kudos.  At the administrative and research levels, not so much.  Today’s headlines have any number of these high level “thinkers” backtracking on their “medical” recommendations which have plunged the world into bankruptcy (or as many reasonably argue, just revealed such to a naive world).I understand that the head guru epidemiologist in GB has retracted his predictions—those that shutdown the UK.  Now his new “model” shows about a tenth as many deaths and illnesses.The only bright side here is the obvious analogy of false fear mongering to Climate Change modeling—also false.  One can see we’d have been bankrupt 10 years ago with the same scare tactics, false predictions, and foolish recommendations, had we gone full “Climate-Chan” at that time.

            The stores I’ve been to in SoCal are using a soft version of this, limiting the number of shoppers.  It hasn’t gummed up the gears bad enough to cause any eruptions in my vicinity, but I was shopping in the more genteel hoods, not the barrio or ghetto, and I’ve stayed out of LA since January.  Once again, a matter of time and degree – if things got/get worse over a longer period, you’d see a big spike.

            Here in the Cradle and Grave of Liberty (Massachusetts) whether there is a queue depends on the type of store.Supermarkets=no queue needed because no limit on number of people inside. Liquor stores (and the Trader Joe’s that sells alcohol) have queues. The chain computer store has queues, only virtual. You physically queue to put your name on a list, then are sent to wait in your car; you get a text when it’s your turn to enter.People seem to be 99%+ obedient, including me mostly. Baaa! (But I’ve not explored the Diverse diverse areas; no idea about those places.)

        I am not sure what it is like in Lagos but here in Indiana it seems pretty much every job is “essential” because almost everyone is going to work three days after the “Hoosier hunker down”. There is a real danger to the ruling class here because it looks like an awful lot of people are simply ignoring the “stay at home” order. I passed a park last night with a bunch of little kids on the equipment with parents watching and a decent number of guys playing basketball. Traffic is lighter than usual and the restaurants are mostly closed so that is weird. The fact that the authorities are mostly letting people do whatever they want makes me also suspect this is a trial run.

                Not here in the DFW burbs.  What with a bare White pop of 45% or so, all the paper ‘murricans and all the NY/CA/IL imports, I’m seeing masks, compliance, and unreasonable panic.  Everything is shut.  The local Cabelas is open but my son says the only thing they’ve been selling for days now is guns and ammo.  The GoodWhites run all the county and local institutions.  Add in a Haitian mayor and a repuke party that had its own local magic negro, and I’m real tired of hearing how Texas is different.

This is the city I was to move to, in order to escape the extreme prog pozz that has rendered my own city full Clown. I move freely here. So far.

New England coastline is full of summer resort towns, from Mystic &amp; Westerly all the way up to Bar Harbor &amp; Jonesport. Many of those summer homes are owned by (((New Yorkers))).  Normally they show up in mid June and leave in mid to late August.  They are already here and more are coming. It began last weekend and it’s been a steady stream ever since. 95 and 1 have a lot of NY plates traveling on them, going north.

                I suspect that “migrants” do not necessarily need to produce valid identification. In that case, what stops a man from growing his beard, and speaking the words of the Shahada on the border, reaffirming his lifelong faith and “proving” that he is of the correct and desirable demographic. (Or stops a woman from putting on a headscarf over a bowed and subservient head.)
Guess I’m not going to be sneaking into Germany soon though. The beard was getting shaggy and I shaved the damn thing off entirely rather than merely trim it.

        A good discussion on the end of civilizations is in “The Collapse of Complex Societies” by Joseph Tainter. His main point is that the solutions to social problems introduce complexity and that complexity has a cost. Eventually, the cost exceeds the benefits as the law of diminishing returns kicks in. It’s not perfect, but it is a useful insight.

            Tainter’s “Drilling Down” is definitely worth a read, too, fwiw. Granted, it’s about a different issue, but the themes of complexity and scale — both of which are important, of course — still underpin everything.

        The Walking Dead should be renamed to the walking poz.   As it turns out, homosexuals, lesbians and race mixers will inherit the Earth. It started getting really ridiculous in like the 5th season, but it was in there from the beginning.  In the very second episode They needed a bad guy and a way to very quickly establish his being a bad guy. Merle is introduced and he uses the N-word and is mean to a woman and makes her cry.  The Mexican gang-bangers are apparently taking care of old people. The stay-at-home wife is being beat by her stupid husband who also touches their child.  It’s just one big poz city.

        The end of Roman rule is a good analogy. Most people think it will be like the Romans leaving Britain where authority disappeared almost overnight and invaders were literally waiting offshore. But it’ll be more like Spain.
My guess is that cities, counties, states or regions will slowly start to disregard an ever-increasingly inept, ineffective and just random federal (or state) government. Local authorities will bit by bit fill the void of authority, creating their own legal, business and law enforcement systems until someone notices that they’re basically independent and makes it official.

            As long as Fed Bux carry weight this won’t happen since it’s very easy for the central empire to make the cost of leaving higher than the cost of staying (for a slight example, see the Feds “temporary” Medicaid subsidies to the states); it’s like they have their own gold mine up in New York and no one is walking away from that.  Many may pin their hopes on the current monetary destruction, but it would be an understatement of the century to say that there are many powerful interests, both foreign and domestic, that want to keep the current financial system afloat.  In fact, it may get better for the dollar and the empire before it gets worse if, say, the Euro fell on hard times.

                Very good point and a major difference between now and Roman times. But a question will be what happens when parts of the country are taxed by the fed gov at a far higher rate than what they get? Over time, that won’t go over so well, especially if the fed gov becomes ever more inept or controlling.
But the issue of currency and financial system is a big one. The Romans used gold and silver. We have the dollar and feds control the dollar. However, failing systems are eventually replaced.

            Good comment!  My only add is that the local authorities will also create their own system of taxation and only remit to higher authorities amounts that they deem appropriate for the services provided by that higher authority.  One citizen is helpless when confronting the revenue authorities but an entire community has a good deal of resistance potential.  They might even create their own local currencies backed by gold or other genuine resources.

        It’s hard to believe, but it has only been 2 weeks since Trump gave that Wednesday evening presser where he announced formation of the Covid-19 task force. It’s only been 2 weeks and yet we live in a completely different world from before. I still have work but my school bus-driver wife sits at home. People still eat but they have to shop early before many staples are sold out for the day. Where once supermarket shelves would be full almost to overflowing, now many shelves are empty and others have only a few token items. People – rightly or wrongly – are scared half out of their minds. They are stocking up on items (still toilet tissue and bottled water) that they would only need if the world as we know it reallywereending. Hell,maybe it alreadyHASand we just don’t know it yet! Two weeks ago tomorrow I remember driving to pick up my first load and,noticing how few cars were on the streets even then, wondering,”Isthishow the world ends?” My next thought was “Shit! It’s Friday the 13th!” – which it was. I was truly hoping to be dead and residing down the way from my folks at Ft.Sam Houston National Cemetery before the Democrats had a chance to F**K things up totally. {sigh} I really don’t want my grandchildren (and great-grandchildren) to grow up in the same conditions my parents grew up in. Unfortunately, the universe doesn’t give a shit what peed-ons like me want.

        So about origins and intelligent design: I know that was a point in passing. I did read the rest of the article and it was good. Dont you love it when people ignore the point and focus on a minor detail?But I was around dealing with the evolution v intelligent design thing at its peak before everyone stopped caring. Its not as simple as ID being a way to avoid knowledge, it was a proxy for the wider culture war. I saw the same tactics being used against dissidents today being used against evolution dissidents back then. Very few counterarguments, isolating, freezing, ruining careers, smearing. Its the same thing we have seen since at least the days of Freud and Boas and all of the other generous people who gifted us our neoliberal society.Does that mean id is true? No. I dont have a dog in the fight myself, im a Christian but we are able to accomodate anything from 6 literal days of creation all the way up to unguided evolution by natural selection.The point is, origins are just a rorschach test. Those who view humanity as infinitely malleable, view progress/revolution/change as neverending are going to look at the black box of origins and find unguided evolution. Those who see something transcendant in the world will at least see a hand behind it all.I wont comment ant further on the veracity of the science underlying any of it to avoid risking the eternal debate, but the fact is any theory of origins has the potential to become a mental cul de sac if you want to use it as confirmation bias and mystical justification for your worldview.Not saying youre doing that, just saying theres nothing special about ID v evolution. Depends on the person I suppose.

            Considering your interest in the evolution question you should watch this Hoover Institute video discussion.  It convincingly details how evolution as Darwin presented would be mathematically impossible.  Knowing the average rate of positive DNA mutations and the number necessary to arrive at any mammalian species today, there has not been enough time.  However, they also agree that however it occurred it wasn’t by intelligent design.

                You can’t use an average to disprove the entire mechanism – almost by definition, the kinds of advantageous mutations Darwin’s theory relies on are outliers.  You can say it’s “doubtful,” but that’s a judgment call.
I’m a skeptic of some aspects of “random mutation + natural selection = new species” – we’re missing something.  I don’t think Hoover’s reaching that conclusion for the right reasons here though.

            Those who view humanity as infinitely malleable, view progress/revolution/change as neverending are going to look at the black box of origins and find unguided evolution.People who think man is infinitely malleable are unlikely to be comfortable with unguided evolution.  In the extreme case now you’ve got people thinking that basically you can change your sex by clicking your heels together and using the wrong pronouns.  This is pretty much a total denial of biological reality.  Most of Leftist ideology is at odds with a real understanding of evolution in fact.  For instance, one of the things that drives feminists insane about the PUA/MGTOW movement was its use of evolutionary psychology to illuminate some of the darker motives of female behavior.  Then you’ve got the discomfort Lefties have with the notion that Northern Europeans have a genetic predisposition towards altruism and that this is being used against them by numerous invasive tribes who have the exact opposite tendency.I think what the typical prog believes in is something a lot like Pokemon evolution.  This is where you get your magical candies together, press a button and there’s a flash of light and you’ve become the next phase of pozzed development without all that pesky natural selection.  You saw the same thing in Star Trek NG where some character gets zapped by a beam of special particles the writers made up for the show.  They then turn into some kind of “energy being” somehow and Deanna Troi blathers about how it’s the next stage of human evolution or something.It’s all a lot like noticing that you can hoist a rock into the air with a pulley and concluding from this that telekinesis should be possible.  It doesn’t work that way.

        Clinically, and clinically only, it’s been interesting to watch Trump’s evolution during this.  He started off at the very first press conference looking like a frustrated little boy forced to spend time with the maiden aunts, as they shrieked and kept their smelling salts at the ready, while keeping him from more important things.  Then he let himself get sucked in, and trying to play it safe re Election 2020, joined in the hand-wringing to the extent that a strategically thinking alpha male could, always still the grown-up in the room.  He still differentiated between hardhit regions and the rest of the country.  Then, 3 days ago, he called it a war, and my heart sank.  You don’t backtrack from that very easily, as the sheep are aquiver and waiting for a signal to stampede.  The very next day, I read that he was starting to worry about the economy.  Then, was it yesterday or the day before, he made Easter D-Day.  And I thought, you have to know that’s too late.  You just have to know it.  But he had indulged the hysteria, and here we are.

        An observation from down here in the Republic of Texas. In many areas’ we’re being asked to “shelter in place”…what the hell that means I don’t know. If you issued these as written, in a military setting, there would be chaos. There’s very little enforcement and a ton of ambiguity. I’m not complaining but its still bullshit. You have a good number here complying but it seems far more because of social media. If you walk outside you can’t really tell. Construction goes on, cars are being serviced, restaurants are still shelping out chow. I can’t believe groups of small business owners have launched law suits somewhere. I guess the chances of winning are small but the largest economy in the world can’t be ground to a halt because of a cold. My hope is that as the country warms up, we rapidly loose patience and move on. Its becoming increasingly disconcerting to watch people just defer to the Gov so blindly. Most of these people are morons. Somebody appears to be counting on that.

        Since 2008, I’ve been of the mindset that the “whimper, not a bang ending,” is the most likely scenario for the end of the American Empire.  The whimper will probably take another 40-50 years, so I will not see the ending.  I expect a general loss of civility and declining purchasing power, which will be similar to what we’ve seen over the last 30 years.However, the “bang” scenario is also a possibility, and we could be seeing that now.  I am convinced that in 2008 we came within 24-48 hours of a banking system collapse.  It could happen again.If I were a betting man, I would put the odds of a long, slow decline at 90%, and a sudden collapse at 10%.  On my darker days it’s 70% – 30%.

            America has been in decline since at least 1970, especially relative to the rest of the world. In the 60s, Americans had, by a very wide margin, the highest income. We owned, per capita, the largest number of TVs, radios, washing machines, dryers, cars, dish washing machines, clothes etc. We had the highest rate of home ownership and were the world’s largest creditor nation. The rest of the world owed us billions of dollars. We were also the most technically advanced.  We led the world in basically every good thing and it wasn’t even close.  Our infrastructure was the envy of the world. From airports to roads to bridges to the grid to telecom, we truly were the best.We are not number one in anything anymore. Civil engineers rate our infrastructure at a D+.

                From 1789 to 1861 to 1933, 72 year spans, a lifetime more or less. Most of the damgage was done by ’33 so now we don’t need a lifetime to make leaps of bad logic, just 40 years to end freedom of association and based money, invade the world invite the world, new world order. One of the olden time historians offered that democracy does not die with a bang but with a wimper. By all means let democracy wimper as a self-segregated peoples learn to shine.

                    The problem is they won’t allow us to self segregate. The house my dad grew up in looks like a war zone.  It was a nice working class city neighborhood that is now an urban hellscape. Same with my mother’s neighborhood. Over the course of their lives, they had to move 5 times.  Their situation was repeated all across the country. I have had to move as well. My entire extended family has fled their homes.  This is why all of the cities have giant soul-sucking suburbs around them. It’s why we can’t have something as simple as public transportation.The Bay Area Rapid Transit system had a big kerfuffle a couple years ago because they refused to report all of the violent crime or release the video of it because, and they actually said it, that it would cause people to wrongly think black people commit a lot of violent crime.  In a normal country, people can take PT from their neighborhood to the center business district.  But we can’t do that if nobody feels safe on the train.

        Thanks, Z, for the nod to the paleocons’ invocations of anarcho-tyranny.  The paleolibertarians have also been on the bandwagon. For some time now, a-t has been the true virus to fear, although so far it has not hobbled the NBA, the closing down of which appears to be the true measure of all things world-ending.

        “Another vision of the end times is the plague scenario. The super-virus is a popular devise to hustle along the collapsing and get right to the end times.” — Z-man
I would feel much better if the coronavirus was really  a super-virus — hell, even really bad flu rather than the wimpy little thing it is. If your immune system is not compromised you will not even notice getting the damned thing.
We are going to die by the policies of the State rather than by virus. That is the future.

        Spain remains an interesting case during the period. In the decades prior to the Visigoths showing up, it was the Vandals, Alans, and Sueves who came across the Pyrenees in 409.One of the interesting things about this history is that – according to the sources, for what they are worth – these tribes were permitted in to Spain by the troops under the command of a rebel Emperor, a Constantine III, who declared himself ruler while in Britain and was able to control Spain and much of Gaul during his run.According to a priest who wrote the account, the reason the troops of the rebel emperor allowed them across was in order to disguise the looting of the population that those troops were, themselves, engaged in. The period was marked by starvation and cannibalism(!) while the barbarians did their share of the looting.They couldn’t make it to Africa at the time, so they needed to come to some sort of agreement of federation with the Empire, or else starve, themselves, which they did. The emperor they cut a deal with was a new rebel emperor who had been appointed by a general of the first rebel emperor’s and which general was rebelling against the first rebel emperor. But in 411 the Visigoths left Italy, allowing the legitimate emperor, Honorius, to defeat the first rebel emperor and then the rebel general was killed by his troops when things started to go bad.That left the Vandals and gang with this rebel emperor in Spain. Honorius, a couple years later, used his new pals the Visigoths, to invade Spain and root out that last pretender to the throne and beat up the Vandals and everybody associated.It’s chaotic, of course. But that’s the point. When things become fluid, all the predictability of the old system goes away. And the system becomes fluid when the guys with the guns decide to run their own show, as is happening in places like Cincinnati and elsewhere. In a Wuhan Flu lockdown, a governor of New York might claim he is the legitimate President. How do you stop him?

        Agree completely, it’s a slow demise not a sudden collapse.  In a democracy like ours has become the Fed printing money is like a bottle of Jack Daniels sitting on the kitchen counter waiting for the alcoholic to come home from work. Only he is now bringing his banker and his employer and all his foreign neighbors with him.By the time his banker and his corporation and those neighbors take their drinks first their is not going to be much left of the Jack Daniels.Eventually he will need to sober up.Democracy and worship of  the Federal Reserve and phony free markets only means the Jack Daniels gets drank faster.What he needs is a leader who takes away the bottle, kicks the bankers in the balls and throws out all the hangers on neighbors.Eventually somebody sobers us up.But it won’t be this democracy we have built.Enjoy that check, it won’t last long without an economy.

        Apocalyptic eschatology is in our DNA.  America was settled entirely by people who believed in the Day of Judgment.You have to reach back to pagan antiquity to trace our “pre-apocalyptic” roots – to the Romans, Greeks &amp; Celts.  The Norse are an exception – Ragnarok puts pagan Norsemen in Club Armageddon, but their concept of Valhalla and the post-Ragnarok age is a pagan one, pace Marvel Comics.“What happens after Judgment Day” is an evergreen troll for Sunday School smartasses, right up there with “how did Abel have kids” and “if we’re Judeo-Christian, why did the Jews kill Christ, and why are they still not sorry?”Most Christians have told me something similar to the Madison Avenue concept of heaven, a life of eternal ease and plenty, milk, honey, lions &amp; lambs, the whole bit.Apocalyptic eschatology is about the journey, not the destination. Revelation is ironically anti-climactic, a detailed roadmap of how to get to Megiddo but little about what to do after we kick Damien’s ass.  Jesus is supposed to bring that plan with him.We don’t know what’s coming, but we were promised since infancy that it would be all good.Forgive us, Z, for wanting that day to come – we know not what we wish for.  We’re only doing what our (((teachers))) said we should.

        And right on cue the EU never lets a good crisis go to waste….“European governments are looking at mobile phone data as a strategic tool to contain the spread of the coronavirus. By asking telecoms companies to hand over anonymous data about people’s locations, countries hope to track infections and warn potentially exposed people. With public health trumping privacy concerns, governments are now rushing to adopt sophisticated surveillance tools, Politico reports. The EU thinks the present crisis demonstrates how data can be used “for the common good”, but critics fear practices are being approved that will be hard to roll back.”

With tower pinging, data this was used to create to create maps of every Chinese’ travel and their intersection with the diseased: out to two or three degrees of separation. Registering of all cell phones with addresses National ID numbers etc is mandatory, It’s how the got on top of it so quickly.It’s coming to a gulag near you. Soon.I’ve seen reports that the number of cell phone accounts in China is down by 15-20 million. The implication is that this is a reflection of the true fatality rate.Who knows?

        Observe, analyze, predict, and prepare. We have been electing morons and criminal grifters to lead us for a long time now and one could argue that Congress is now ruled by sociopaths. I put the odds at 50:50 between muddle through once again and rapid collapse into anarcho-tyranny. If the former, then put your energy into building individual robustness. If the latter, a new paradigm in necessary. Simple, secret, solo, and spontaneous. It’s the only way to be sure.

        Just took my kid to the bank – doors locked.  Had to use the window service.  Given germs and viruses are transmitted by hand, how this makes any difference eludes me.  Then picked up yesterday’s mail . . . to find a helpful little postcard from coronavirus.gov reminding me to “Listen to and follow directions of your State and Local Authorities.”  I’d always rather stay home than deal with diversity and clownworld, but this is so far beyond that all I can do is sneer and laugh at everyone.

        So cities in Canada are starting to fine people for not obeying the ‘social distancing’ orders.  In most cases, $1000 for the first offence.  In Newfoundland, you can lose your driver’s license.  But like Z says, forget about the everyday crimes being committed.  I guess as long as they keep their social distance, go ahead and rob that bank.

        Gonna go out on a limb and hazard a guess that what’s happening right now is an attempt to double employment by forcing everyone into de facto 20 hour workweeks through enforced telework. Old people can’t retire and young people can’t find jobs it’s an obvious solution and advances the economic leveling inherent in globalization (wealthier individuals being forced to work less). Haven’t seen anyone else mention this angle.

            Perhaps this is the gig economy acceleration.I see a continual transfer of people from careers to jobs to gigs. Until we come full circle and the norm is subsistence cloud-based labor farming.The bossman is an app or a mega-corp that is both everywhere and nowhere.The labor force is totally fungible and algo-priced just like an uber fare except solving for the lowest price.The gig economy is a leveraged wealth extractor of the timeless modern model of private profit and public risk.Utilizing public infrastructure, the capital “owned” (borrowed) by their labor, and the ancillary costs of health insurance, pension, disability, etc. passed onto the government programs, all these gigs create income for the cloud today while pushing the actual expenses into the future.Apply a growth factor and multiple and then extract moar value from the public markets before the ponzi collapses under its own weight.Related. I saw a DOW puff piece about all the hiring brought on by the china virus.The big winners? Food delivery like door dash, shopping apps like Instacart, Amazon sweatshops, grocery stockers, Walgreens, Dollar General, Walmart, and Dominoes Pizza.You can see where this is heading.

        “Collapse is a sudden, involuntary and chaotic form of simplification.”–The Mandibles, A Family 2029-2047While working in water treatment, I also learned the basic economic theorem, as Z comments, you don’t throw $1 million at a $100 problem. You don’t demand as the enviro public does “pure” water because you can’t afford it….with all the regulations, upgrades and $millions spent for the continual upgrades to treatment processes at plants…you will soon not be able to afford your water. Same with the virus. The choice is:  Tank the economy to save some lives (the numbers aren’t there), forgetting that when the economy is tanked an unintended consequence is depressed people jumping off bridges and a Turd world economy.  Hm…some choice.I am noticing women here in Cedar City having a couple of reactions. Taking a bearing on the Mormon women I know, they go immediately into…..”God’s in control of this so therefore I don’t want to talk about nor think about the virus or economy at all. Trust in God or I’ll get pissy at you.” I bring up…what happened to tether your camel…and I get a baleful shutdown. For Mormon women in Utah, the blinkers are up and hoping for the Second Coming and the gathering to Zion.  For non-Mormon women, high levels of stress, anxiety, and arm waving plus they don’t want to talk about virus or economy either. Do whatever the CDC edicts demand. Save me! The blinkers are up, except for screaming hysterically Orange Man Bad!   I am so bored with women…..sigh. Not much hope back here for a wakeup.PS:  Opening up the prison doors and dumping the maladjusted violent on us is another form of Cloward-Piven strategy ala Saul Alinsky. Overload the system, Baby! Collapse it.

                I don’t know how the men are doing. Reminder that back here away from the Salt Lake corridor men aren’t all just city men.  We still have ranchers here….sheep, cattle, alfalfa and other ag. Assume ranchers to be somewhat different than in-town guys. Ranchers are out in every frozen snot roast your ass dusty dirty weather and deal in high stakes gambling with their crops both animal and forage. Ranchers must run on testicular fortitude.In-town men are often the usual hive guy. Check out Kurt Schlichter’s Peoples Republic for his take on Mormon ranchers. You may want to cultivate a few for the coming hard times! It’s the ranchers and Mormon buckaroos that will most likely revert to the tough SOBs that can stand and deliver. The city hive Mormons have lost that pull the handcart Hole in the Rock San Juan Mission tough common sense. The young modern Mormon would crap his pants just has quickly as a hive soyboy. You can deduce from there.However, don’t screw with their guns. If the Imperial Capital orcs attempt to dump the 2nd, expect a blow up back here. You don’t want to push some of these folks backed into a corner. Won’t be pretty.  Quite a number of cute little old ladies are armed in church!

        Man, this guy (Thomas Nagel, NYU/Princeton) must REALLY not want to think, ya think?Thomas Nagel: Thoughts Are RealBy Richard BrodyJuly 16, 2013The philosopher Thomas Nagel’s new book, “Mind and Cosmos: Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature Is Almost Certainly False,”Since neither physics nor Darwinian biology—the concept of evolution—can account for the emergence of a mental world from a physical one, Nagel contends that the mental side of existence must somehow have been present in creation from the very start. But then he goes further, into strange and visionary territory. He argues that the faculty of reason is different from perception and, in effect, prior to it—“an irreducible faculty.” He suggests that any theory of the universe, any comprehensive mesh of physics and biology, will need to succeed in “showing how the natural order is disposed to generate beings capable of comprehending it.”And this, he argues, would be a theory of teleology—a preprogrammed or built-in tendency in the universe toward the particular goal of fulfilling the possibilities of mentality. In a splendid image, Nagel writes, “Each of our lives is a part of the lengthy process of the universe gradually waking up and becoming aware of itself.”In effect, the universe tends toward maximizing certain goals and places “value in the result toward which things tend”—and Nagel assimilates this metaphysical tendency to human morality, which would mesh, gradually and incrementally (with backward as well as forward steps) with the value that inheres in the universe. In this view, the discovery of those values is inextricable from the understanding of what the universe is. Physics and metaphysics, biology and moral philosophy join together in Nagel’s vision of a distant, eventually unified-field theory of the universe, of existence. His cosmic, overarching vision is remarkably anthropocentric—anchored in an idea of practical progress at a scale of human experience, with human history echoing the history of the universe.https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/thomas-nagel-thoughts-are-real

            Correct. The ID’er version of the beginning is “Something created all of this for some purpose. Enough said.” There is nothing more to know, so what is the point in thinking any further on the subject?
Nagel would also do himself a world of good by not committing the fallacy of the undistributed middle and the modal fallacy. In fairness, maybe the reviewer is not correctly paraphrasing his views.
That said, thanks for posting it. I may want to post on it.

            The reviewer’s description is hard to follow but this seems like a variant on the Gaia hypothesis – man was created to help the universe understand itself.  It’s a cosmic. overarching vision but it’s not clear that it’s “his.”  Outside looking in, he seems to be exploring already-discovered country.

        I looked at the list of things the police would not respond to in Cincinnati. Up here in Canuckistan, my local police would not respond to a lot of those things before COVID. Many property crimes are reported online with no visit by police. Being assured by Ottawa that racism is not winning in the war against COVID 19 is little consolation.

        “The model to keep in mind is probably something like post-Rome Spain. Once the Roman authority collapsed, various barbarian rulers tried to fill the void, with varying degrees of failure. Eventually, local authority filled the gaps, providing order and protection for the people.”Not sure what your timeframe is here. The Visigoths were foreign barbarians who ruled Spain with the aid of the Roman Church. As a result, it was the only part of post-Rome where the Church was able to actually call the shots (unlike most people’s idea that the Pope ran Europe). Two results: since the Church’s ideas — especially its moral demands — were resented by the natives, the Moors found it easy to get the natives on their side and overthrow the establishment. Second, and contrariwise, the natives grew accustomed to religious authoritarianism, thus leaving fertile ground for the Inquisition and a general kind of mental backwardness we think of as particularly “Spanish”

            The Visogoths had to strike deals with local authorities in order to maintain any sense of order. The church was actually quite weak at the time. For example, church officials wanted new impositions put on the Jews, but they were ignored, because the Jews actually had more influence than the Church. Even the laws against the Jews converting their slaves were largely ignored out of necessity.

                The last paragraph sums it up quite well –
“Of course, mitigating a pandemic will require cooperation and planning by all levels of government and the private sector. Unfortunately, a 2005 report suggests that the United States is not prepared for an influenza pandemic…a dose of personal responsibility may be the best ways to protect Americans in the event of a future influenza pandemic.”
In summary, Americans are screwed. With the French and Italians leading the way!

And we’re redneck as Hell.And that and them I’ll continue to defend, and yes in their case Their Government of Ordered Liberties.That’s worth defending.

        Got linked into some of Matt Bracken’s old stuff yesterday.  Should things continue to go south it’s certainly plausible some of his ideas may come true especially if people with the right skill sets organize.
Of course this “neighborhood watch on steroids ” only works with a tight-knit community.  When the lights go out and the taps run dry ?  Then it’s every man for himself. Timeline till the end ?  No idea , but as the wise man Remus would say ” stay away from crowds ” 😉

        You are doing amazingly good thought provoking journalistic work and the societal reformative and informative aspects of your endeavors can’t be praised in words or even through money for that matter. I send you my sincerest appreciation and warmest regards from India.
Keep up the good work bro’

        There is an interesting precedent to the release of prisoners. When the communist block collapsed, the transitional governments decided to release prisoners en masse causing chaos in their countries. This may have been a symptom of changing guard from “inhumane” communism to more “humane” liberal democracy or, more likely, a deliberate action to cause chaos and give the plebs something to focus on, while the various ‘elite’ factions fight for power.
Relevant example from that time:https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-01-02-mn-175-story.html

        Honestly who do you think these “warlords” that will rule over the putatively emergent feudal system Libertardians and Paleo- junkies so think they desire will be?Who do you think will rule? Who have you described?You’re going to be ruled by Cops locally and Soldiers Nationally.It just happened in LA. The Sheriff who is head of the local FEMA got tired of the local pols stirring the pot and held his own press conference, said I’m in charge not them.  The media ❤️❤️❤️ Him in their coverage.It’s natural to ❤️ The Strongman.LA county is releasing non- violent misdemeanor offenders, not dangerous ones.   NY of course was before COVID, mind you it went a bit south when a black nutter Wrapped his head in tin foil and killed a few Hebes .This actually isn’t crazy, its just pandering to minorities.As far as the cop haters here and tiresomely haunting the comments of the Right – you’re not serious people, you just have a drug problem.The cops don’t have time to harass the ordinary citizen, and if you weren’t fuxups they wouldn’t bother with you.Honestly who do you think these “warlords” that will rule over the putatively emergent feudal system Libertardians and Paleo- junkies so think they desire will be?Who do you think will rule? Who have you described?You’re going to be ruled by Cops locally and Soldiers Nationally.This has already long begun, what might mystify me is why you don’t want to be cops or soldiers; it doesn’t.You can’t pass a drug tox screen.Honestly if weed makes you this angry and paranoid give it up.You will be ruled by Cops and Soldiers.The alternative is the present train wreck of coked up bankers and Jews.Doesn’t being oppressed by your own sound better than being ravaged by tranny queens?Notice I make no plug for self govt.You’re not worthy, and you won’t have it.  So be it.Support your local sheriff.He almost certainly is better than your local lawyers, and will almost certainly not have Tranny Library Day.

        Z,
I hope you’ve learned your lesson with the Anti-cop shrieking, libertardian dope head Tumblr your comments page has become.
All because the Cleveland police aren’t going to respond in person to nuisance calls.   Why should they?  Ever?  But now in particular.
BTW the NYPD has 200 plus COVID positives.   Perhaps some context and restraint is called for?
For the next 2 weeks your comments section is going to be Hate Cops TUMBLR.    It won’t get easier as the lockdown goes on and they can’t score without even more than the usual fear and paranoia.

            Who are you kidding? You had made up your mind about us before you even came here!
That said, I agree that it’s bad optics to shit on cops right now, whether they deserve it or not.

                Au Contraire, I’ve formed the opinions herein over time.Years in fact, really Moldbug the very beginning to now.  There’s a reason Land and Moldbug walked away from blogs.  (Land has returned but is writing so cryptically not 5 people understand his recent posts).But listen, if you want to have a mild and sort of very dry Libertarian Jon Stewart Tumblr page ok.  There are some interesting people here in terms of potential productivity, but over time the regulars make any place into their own sort of dive bar.And not the kind that were fun to drink in.The cops have the balls to face difficulty, danger and confrontation.The more dangerous occupations statistically do tend to be farmworkers, but the maladjusted mock that too.   That leaves the building trades, which I guess are familiar enough to be well grudgingly respected.   &lt;&lt;however only men who confront other men and the danger they pose are going to get us out of this mess, even if its to an only less insane world.   We will not get to any safety of sanity without brave men.Meanwhile tonite – unless any of you can say they are will go out this evening to wrestle a nigger to the ground to protect strangers life and property, or have done so – it just comes off as the lesser men envying the better one.We will get nowhere without brave men, we certainly will gain nothing more from snark.
