        Not only are all humans not the same, all immigrants are not the same, as immigrants.Over the decades I have had extensive interaction with two immigrant communities:  Asian, primarily Vietnamese, and Hispanic, primarily Central American.The Asians retain strong ties to their original culture and community, but are glad to be living and working in America; they see themselves as Americans, or future Americans.  The extended family may live ten to a house, but they own the house.  They may send money back to the home country, but they also spend heavily in America – Asians love to shop, eat out, drive flashy cars, wear designer brands.  They want to enjoy life, and for others to see them enjoying it.Hispanics in my experience won’t spend a dime if they don’t have to.  Everything goes back home.  They pack themselves into rental properties, shop at Wal-Mart, dine out rarely, and drive beat up used cars.In short, Hispanics are a drag on the American economy.  The only trickle down trickles down to, say, Honduras.  First, they depress wages, meaning less money in circulation; then, they ship that money out, meaning no money in circulation.  With twenty million of these folks in the country, and most job creation going to immigrants, you have a big reason why the U.S. economy has remained limp.  What we have here is de facto foreign aid on a massive scale, a huge transfer payment to foreign soil with no benefit to the host.  We are being bled out.I’m for shutting the border and slowing immigration to a crawl, as we did in the 20’s in order to allow the flood from the late 19th and early 20th century to assimilate.  When open borders fanatics gives the speech about America being a nation of immigrants, they conveniently leaves out the fact that, for 60 years, we were not.

        I propose the bacon test for immigration.  If you will eat bacon, you are eligible for immigration, if not – stay where you are.  Oh by the way, “eligible for immigration” means legal immigration.  I don’t care if you raise hogs, if you are here illegally ..go home peacefully or otherwise.

        Yesterday, on the flagship news program of Al-beeb — Britain’s left-leaning state broadcaster, funded by a tax you cannot ever avoid — there was a story about a muslim who, having decided to go and kill people in Syria, returned to the UK having planted stories on social media about his sad demise fighting for the caliphate. Alas for him the cover story of his tragic death in combat was thin and he was arrested getting off a channel ferry.Al-beeb, as is their wont, described him as ‘British’ which is of course, a laugh of the first magnitude. He is, like so many of the many islamic imports to these islands, anything but British. He may speak the language and hold a UK passport, but he is through and through committed to another national ideal. Quite possibly one that would prefer to see Britain under some other control.This then is what happens with immigration. The arrested man was almost certainly born here but while his parents may well have been prepared to commit to their new home, their offspring eventually start to think otherwise. Britain is a small country and while a large area like the USA can probably absorb a lot of people (though building towns and getting utilities to them may be a stretch) but this nation on the edge of muslim-invaded Europe isn’t. So into this crowded mix begin to appear the offspring of immigrants who make it clear they want another world, and are prepared to be violent on behalf of it.I should add that I have no idea if this arrested warrior of the ‘religion of peace’ wants to actively make trouble in these islands, but he is ‘trained’ and ‘educated’ and it soon becomes a small step to take up arms in his own town.My point is that this man is anything but British, and I suspect in the US you will soon have the sons (and daughters) of immigrants who will stop wanting to be American and revert to some other loyalty. Of course, our leaders can never imagine this happening, but it does.Oh yes, we too in the UK have plenty of ‘corner shops’ able to wire British money abroad. I bet some of it comes back to haunt us, too.

            The repatriated radical presents the biggest challenge to the cult of modern liberalism. After all, if you bar them from entry, you raise the issue of citizenship, which the Left thinks is old fashioned. If you let them in, they start murdering liberal cartoonists. There’s a third option of considering them as criminals, but then you have to invent a crime that transcends time and place. Imagine France arresting someone for shoplifting at a Ukrainian retail shop. France has no jurisdiction and no authority to force Ukrainians to abide by French law. How can that possibly work?That’s why the Left likes calling these guys “home grown” radicals. That way they skirt the thorny issue of what to do with them and can instead shift the focus to the “social forces that radicalized these poor Muslims.”

        The best part is how open border supporters make this a compassion and caring issue, while it’s DE-facto enabling exploitation.
Illegal central American workers combine the best of slavery, cheap and outside any laws with none of the liability (which slave owners had).
It’s funny how the police isn’t even allow to check someones immigration status, what a joke…

        Speaking from the perspective of the ruling class. From their perspective, border control is heresy.

        Not sure I understand, Z. Your last two paragraphs read like satire. Are you saying we SHOULD open the borders? Or being snarky? I know the libtards want open borders, but I sure as hell don’t.
And yes, Rubio shot down his career over amnesty.
