                        Government ‚Ä¶. oh my!!!  You should see the inside workings of the VA ‚Ä¶. the ‚Äúmales‚Äù who marinate there (non-medical or maintenance) have all gone woke.  Interestingly, black men I knew when working there could still maintain a level of masculine behavior, due to special status.  The rest of the biologically male there were holed up in their esoteric, isolated and encapsulated realms ‚Äî specialists who don‚Äôt threaten the female power structure.  Same culture now in place in organizations like Bureau of Land Management, where a former colleague reported (before decamping for a more tolerable arena) the power girls were running the show, down to the most remote intermountain outpost.

                            Y2K-ish I worked briefly at an 8A tech firm, Chinese owned and many in IT. I guess they were good coders and (post Bell Curve) I concede they were smarter than me. But many of these were immigrants, and while you wouldn‚Äôt expect them to speak English well, as a sysadmin I did expect them to know some of the basics of the Unix operating system. But to be fair, neither was I a hot-shot C++ coder or whatever. In any event, I was not a good fit for this workaholic minnow in the tech world, so the incipient early retiree soon moved on to a less demanding job in an air conditioned office closer to home üôÇ

            I had a summer job (aka paid, 40 hours a week) at a major insurance company‚Äôs HQ back in the 80‚Äôs. The only male in an all female department, no one told me my first day also happened to be a ‚Äúdress down day.‚ÄùSo I show up and my new boss is a middle-aged, meh looking female in giant read trouble glasses and a ‚ÄúPlato‚Äôs Retreat‚Äù sweatshirt. All of the other people in the unit were old females, and one young African American female.Now since I was 19, ‚Äúold‚Äù might have put these grandmas at, say 40.So they give me a desk, an IBM XT computer, and I am supposed to process these stacks of paper into the thing. As I prefer standing, I did so as I did this boring-ass job. Like a competitive sport. I banged out stacks, they brought me more.One day the assembled old women ‚Äì minus the black one ‚Äì gather around my desk. ‚ÄúYou have to slow down and make the work last all day or they are going to give us more‚Ä¶‚ÄùMy 19-year old reply, ‚Äúsure, riiiight.‚Äù I go back to doing it my way. Forget those old broads. So now boss lady, surely wise to the error of my ways, gives me a ‚Äúspecial project.‚Äù At said insurance company ‚Äì again, the corporate home office ‚Äì there was a wall-length set of card catalogues. Like at a library. My new ‚Äúassignment‚Äù was to ‚Äúgo through every card and make sure none are out of alphabetical order‚Ä¶‚Äù There were probably a couple of million cards.At that point, and since I had already met the guys on an upper floor, been playing pickup basketball, company softball, stickball, with them after work and eliminating cases of beer afterwards ‚Ä¶ I just spent the rest of the summer hanging out with these guys, away from my desk. Never did the ‚Äúproject‚Äù‚Ä¶ another lick of work ‚Ä¶ and no one said a word.I, er, decided big corporation life ‚Ä¶ not for me. Very valuable experience. As the owner and founder of multiple businesses, everything in my realm is performance based.

                In between high school and college I had a similar gig in the word processing department in a big accounting firm. Same group of middle aged hags but ‚Äúsupervised‚Äù by an old woman who was past retirement age and had been working there since 1955 (this was in 88).  Same middle aged white women with a couple of older (token) black women.  Same gibs mindset of spreading out the work as long as possible and a lot of complaining about ‚Äúextra‚Äù stuff that had to be done quickly to ensure they were appreciated.Got a lot of reading done at that job.  Shortly after I left the entire firm collapsed. Turns out they were helping a firm hide a lot of fraud.They had a black guy who would show up in the morning and have some coffee and say hello to everyone, then he would disappear for the rest of the day. Total flaming homosexual. But they loved to bring him out and parade him around for visiting clients. Why, I have no idea. He was literally a xerox machine operator.

                    Where I was is still a major insurance company with a recognized name. There were two guys that worked the mail room. One, a WW2 combat veteran, built a wall with cases of copy paper ‚Äì between him and the flamer on the other side. And made it clear, said flamer ‚Äúbetter not cross‚Ä¶.‚ÄùSo I am new on the job and said flamer, a black guy with a lisp, and wearing a pink suit ‚Äì cannot make that shit up, does the one arm in the elevator door, steps in seeing me in their alone. He proffers a business card with his personal name, address and phone # on it.Here is basically how it goes:J (his real name started with a ‚ÄúJ‚Äù): Lisps out, ‚Äútho you‚Äôre in colletch, raht?‚ÄùMe: Yup.J: Tho, colletch is espensive. I could take you to the mall and buy you close. Any close you want. You can come over, I can cook for you.Me: Nope. Elevator opens, I get out, flipping card back at flamer.We never talk again, although H (his real name started with a ‚ÄúH‚Äù) comes out with us guys to lunches and beer ‚Äì great mountain of a guy.

                        Our flamer was the same way and would color match his outrageous suits down to the socks and shoes.  He was absolutely shameless in his flamingness. There was a white guy who was a homosexual working in the same job as the black guy and he did everything he could to hide it. Because he had a work ethic, he basically had to do both of their jobs.

                        That story is hilarious.  The WWII combat veteran made me think of my deceased dad.  For his generation, the worse thing that a man could be was a ‚Äúdraft dodger‚Äù and the second was a ‚Äúfag.‚Äù  The Office Services flamer was a walking talking stereotype come to life.  When obvious homosexuals first appeared on screen, they were portrayed as lisping, limp-wristed dandies.  Nowadays, the narrative is that gay men are the same as straight men, except that their romantic proclivities extend to men.  Your experience shows how stereotypes become stereotypes to begin with.

                            I lived in San Francisco during outbreak of AIDS. My wife had two gay-guy girl friends so I learned there were entire subsets of gays. Queens, GQ dudes, Rough Ride (biker wannabes), etc.
That was way more info than I needed so I moved.

            I‚Äôm living it!  My boss is a woman.  Her boss is a woman and her boss is a woman.  Thankfully, her boss is a man and the CEO is a man.  I work in broadcasting where I can bet dollars to donuts that there are more women now employed than men.  However, the women are usually never in the technical roles.  They are usually reporters, PAs, associate producers, producers, supervising producers, etc., therefore, they are determining the editorial content.  Hence, we get what we pay for in the media today.

                My wife and I both work for non-profits.  There are no actual businesses in Portland except for weed shops and bars.  The few that start here eventually move to less communist parts of the NW like Washington or Idaho.  Thankfully I work away from the office in one of those roles the women don‚Äôt care for.  Occasionally I have to drive into town and do something at the office.  In both our office and my wife‚Äôs even I was actually a bit surprised and kept thinking ‚Äúwhere the hell are all the men?‚Äù.  I seriously wonder sometimes what jobs the white male part of the population here support themselves with.  I‚Äôve seen this at other offices around the area too.  It‚Äôs always at least 2 to 1 female/male and in many places like where I and the wife work, it‚Äôs like 40 women and 2-3 nu-male/gay types.  The pajeet men are of course all working the tech jobs that used to go to white guys.  The Mexican guys have their leafblowers but what the hell do all those white guys still do?

                Boomer senior partners deliberately installed bitter women and limpwrists as an impenetrable protective layer between themselves and ambitious GenX like me. Everything we did was cataloged by admin and support for later reporting and use by the seniors against us when it came to be promotion or cull time. I made the grade but couldn‚Äôt maintain my sanity living in KGB-like territory and founded my own firm together with other GenX. Nobody in our firm will follow you into the bathroom stalls to monitor your habits and also slide his foot underneath, tap away and whistle a solicitation.

                            There is something different about people who want to run their own shop. It‚Äôs not the risk or the competence. I suspect it is the loneliness. To be the boss is to be alone in your work. In a corporation, even the CEO has friends in the office. It can never work that way in small business. You have your social life outside the business.

Although he was not my direct superior, I saw what he pulled on my buddies and also had to have some direct interactions with him ‚Äì he was massively inept and I never ratted this fool out.So along comes a guy with special skills. Said management guy pulls this ‚Äòdocumenting‚Äô bullshit on wrong guy. Wrong guy taps his phone for others to listen in on calls to company HQ. Picks locks, back when personnel files were paper. Pilfers negs out ‚Äì with guys enjoying sitting on Mr. VP‚Äôs desk, laughing it up. Sitting in wrong guy‚Äôs office listening in to management foof blather on with the HQ, hilarious. Tapping the phone back then was child‚Äôs play.Later, said management foof sued the company for ‚Äúage discrimination‚Äù after new management promoted a younger, much more capable guy over him. I am still buddies with the guy promoted ‚Äì the old guy is dead.

        I hope your prediction is correct, this feminine rule or supremacy has to end.  As an old guy  i find many young men hard to relate to and feel uncomfortable to be around. Working class guys with skills not so much.
What an abomination of nature to see female rule and control everywhere. From Scandinavia, New Zealand, Canada and just less so in the rest of the West. Hopefully something good comes out of the current crisis to finally start to remedy this. It‚Äôs INSANE!

                Meme, I am sure thats part of it. But I think a lot of it has to do with actual work.Labor is good for the soul. We are meant to work, to produce, build, create. Men who toil in the physical space are grounded in reality, subject to the natural order of things, be it gravity and the necessity of accurate angles, or simply the deep satisfaction of visible and tangible results of their efforts.Men need a sense of purpose. Physical-based labor is the straightest line.Conversely, in the modern gynocracy, the bugmen are perpetually adrift in conflicting arcs of esoteric and fleeting purpose, with their progress marked by extrinsic status milestones established by the very women they are meant to lead.But yes, fathers are essential. Which is why the war on masculinity and fatherhood rages on.

                    In my other post here I talked about how I often wonder where all the men are when I see our local workplaces.  I‚Äôve often wondered if young men, seeing their ambitions frustrated again and again by the gynocracy will not eventually start turning to organized (or disorganized) crime.  This may be inevitable in fact as more and more of the kind of things men enjoy become criminalized.  There‚Äôs no HR bitch in the mafia at least.

                Years ago I spent time coaching 8-12 year olds. The ones with the single mothers were a different bunch. Lazier, usually. Some of their mothers would show up and immediately begin ‚Äòauditioning‚Äô me to become the defacto new father. This was some 15 years ago.

                    I had a similar experience a year ago while coaching peewee football.  You could tell which kids came from divorced families or had single mothers.  Even if they were natural athletes, the rules of the game and fundamentals were not there.  Even more challenging, a lot of the kids didn‚Äôt know the positions.  Before this, I could not conceive of a 10 year-old that did not know what a wide receiver or running back was, or where they would line-up on a play.

                        I am talking about more fundamental life things ‚Äì and am someone who knows young lineman need to study the plays and the rules. I didn‚Äôt expect 8 years olds to know what a ‚Äútake‚Äù was, let alone the take sign, how to keep one foot out of the batter‚Äôs box to get the sign from the 3rd base coach‚Ä¶My practices for baseball started with the boys running two laps around the field. So first time at this, single mother raised (thus far) malingerer quits. As I am exhorting the rest to ‚Äòkeep going‚Äô and pick up the pace.Says he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt run, a fly bit me‚Äù (raises arm). I point to his mother, sitting in the stands ‚Ä¶ (she drove a high end vehicle despite no means of that income BTW)‚Ä¶Coach: ‚Ä¶‚Äùis that your mother?‚ÄùKid: ‚ÄúYes.‚ÄùCoach: Good. Leave the field and go sit with her for the rest of the practice.‚ÄùHe glumly walks off. Next practice the kid ran the damn laps. The mother did not give me any shit about this, so that was a plus.

                        Bring to mind a comment made by Michael Savage in 2008 regarding autism:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it‚Äôs a brat who hasn‚Äôt been told to cut the act out. That‚Äôs what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they‚Äôre silent? They don‚Äôt have a father around to tell them, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt act like a moron. You‚Äôll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don‚Äôt sit there crying and screaming, idiot.&#x27;‚ÄùSavage was wrong abut autism, but he was right that fathers tend to be more forceful with their kids than mothers.  Normal men, anyway.  Maybe not liberals.

                        Kids are more involved in afterschool activities today than 40 years ago.  Even in intact families, more often than not, no one is home when school lets out, so the kids are packed off to afterschool activities and the coaches and instructors act as surrogate parents.

                            One thing I remember years ago as an undergrad student was in a psychology class learning the concept of de facto surrogate fathers.  Boys without fathers will reach out unconsciously to any man they can form a relationship with.  Since learning that concept, I‚Äôve noticed such a few times in real life and in readings of lives of some of our notables today.  Never happened to me, but it may fall upon you someday.

            Especially true here in the frozen tundra we call Canada.  Our self-professed feminist and esteemed Prime Minister, with the great hair and now a beard, Justin Trudeau is a prime example.  His father, Pierre, who basically ruined this country, hooked up with his crack-wh%$e, feminist mother who‚Äôs past-time was riding the c#@k carousel.  After the father died, he was basically raised by his mom which explains why Canada falls more and more into the shitter.  I bet this guy has never picked up a wrench before and has never had any dirt under his nails.  Women love him here though, as do most soyboys.  He‚Äôs a Gen X‚Äôer as am I and I think we‚Äôve done more to harm the West than anybody else.

                No, your Greatest Generation predecessors gave away the farm in the 1960s with the 1965 immigration act,the desertion of private property rights, and, never forget, the welfare state.  Then Boomers embraced the siren song of free trade, put the Clintons in office, and let the media and schools begin the Long Brainwashing.  Neither generation gave a damn about the Bill of Rights, or the evildoing of the Fed or Henry Kissinger, and here we are.

                Most women in the military don‚Äôt want to serve in combat.  There are a few ambitious women who see combat service as a faster way up the promotion ladder.  How many of them fly helicopters (Rep. Mikie Sherrill in peacetime) or airplanes (Sen. Martha McSally in Afghanistan)?
I suspect that the greatest support for women in combat comes from people who figure that they will never need to fight.  Someone else‚Äôs daughter can go.  Hiding behind a woman‚Äôs skirt, so to speak.

            Epaminondas, my GF told me early on in the Great Panic that she was so thankful to have me in her life because she would otherwise likely be extremely anxious and upset over the wuhan.Its not to toot my horn, but to reinforce the multitude of ways in which a healthy pair-bonding provides stability and pro-social behaviors.She manages 300 people in an essential business, almost all women. The line of demarcation between calm and carry on and the ‚Äúmental health leave‚Äù and other bubbling issues is clear. Single women just see the world differently and accordingly require an enormous resource allocation, even in the best of times.Before my GF met me these correlations and patterns went mostly unnoticed. But the virus has really revealed the constellation of dysfunction from feminism. Its like once you see Orion‚Äôs belt in the night sky.I am hoping the darkness of wuhan will reveal many such patterns and many more noticers will be born.

                As I‚Äôve said before, my wife ‚Äúcomplements‚Äù me.  Her strengths are my weaknesses and my strengths her weaknesses.  In that lies the foundation of success and mutual respect. Don‚Äôt ask me how this came about and what‚Äôs the secret as I don‚Äôt know.  I was a stupid youth with little more on my mind than a good time when we met.  I married up, she down.

        More specifically, gynocracy is the road to species extinction. And that is no trivial thing. Patriarchy has been part of our evolutionary model for hundreds of thousands of years, and it got us to the top of the species pyramid. In a few short generations, we have reversed that ancestral trend line and now males are degenerating into eunuchs. Islamists will fight to the death in order to preserve patriarchy, but the West is now actively killing off it‚Äôs alphas. We can‚Äôt wait on the sidelines forever. It‚Äôs man-up time.

                    If one was so minded it would be quite straightforward to point to (((WW1))) as a mechanism to kill off many of Europe‚Äôs existing elite (many of the ruling class‚Äô sons served at that time) and fill the positions with lots of recent emigres.and (((ww2))) to kill a large percentage of Europe‚Äôs young men to move to a more controlled env and bring in the teen/perpetual youth movement for the generation after. You effectively used the death from the war as a firebreak of the usual generational culture transmission giving you free reign to remake society using the tv.But that sounds as unlikely as global house arrest for 1 billion people for a flu virus.

                        There is a scene at the beginning of ‚ÄúChariots of Fire‚Äù when they sit down to eat in one of the Oxford college dining rooms.

My club in the city has a similar memorial wall in the lobby.  Huge number of names, but what is most striking is you recognize many of them as from the prominent society families of New York during the World Wars.

        Very anecdotal, but young girls (think high school) don‚Äôt seem too impressed by feminism.

They also openly say that they want a family with many saying that they would like to stay home. The feminist stigma surrounding the stay at home mom is dying. Young women don‚Äôt buy it.Interestingly, the teenagers that I meet ‚Äì despite their indoctrination ‚Äì are more conservative in many ways that my Gen X group. They don‚Äôt drink as much. They don‚Äôt have sex as much or as early. They think about family more. Of course, I‚Äôm meeting kids who‚Äôs parents are almost always still married and who have been raised in pretty normal, upper-middle class homes. Many, but not most, go to church, but I suspect that those that don‚Äôt are picking up on the ways that church-going families behave.I‚Äôll also say this. Young white men are very aware that are disliked. They are race conscious, as are a surprising number of young white women. They‚Äôre not idiots. They‚Äôve been hit with anti-racism propaganda since birth, and by high school, they‚Äôre figuring out just exactly what that means: White people suck. They‚Äôre also figuring out that other groups are exempt.The gynocracy will crash not just against reality but race. So far, the gynocracy has mostly been a white woman gynocracy, but other groups will want into the fun. Women may be a majority of voters, but white women aren‚Äôt. And as the OJ Simpson case proved, minority women choose race over gender.

            It seems to me that the HS age group would be receptive to Woke Agenda ridicule, since the Wokeness is in full force these days, to the point of being over the top and into the realm of parody.  There‚Äôs a tendency with kids to rebel against the older generation and authority anyway and you would think they‚Äôve had it with this nonsense surrounding them 24/7.

                Exactly, and as Z has noted, the anti-whites won the war. They are in charge, despite they‚Äôre ceaseless harping about being victims. The young always rebel against authority. But now, you‚Äôre adding in race and gender. Young whites, especially young white men, are facing an authority that openly despises them. It‚Äôs not just ridicule that works, but ridicule and truth. Young whites are lied to from birth about everything, and they can sense it. Telling them even small truths is like a drink of water in a desert.

                    My high school boys got a big dose of reality via the bussing of vibrancy from the inner city into our nice suburban school.  I consider myself to be a realist, but they are outright racist.  These programs were supposed to make make everyone feel equal, but have had the opposite effect.  I have to remind them to treat everyone as an individual first, but it‚Äôs okay to see truth.

                        DLS,I respectfully disagree. One of the hardest conclusions that I have reach is that in fact, we can‚Äôt treat everyone as an individual. This is what got us where we are now.Ironically, you can only treat the member of another tribe as an individual if you first acknowledge that you‚Äôre members of different tribes and where those tribal boundaries lie. Once those issues are settled, we can treat each other as individuals because we know that everyone will return to their own community/country in short order.A major dividing line in the Dissident Right is between those who understand why they must stop that nice black couple from moving into the neighborhood and those who don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt hate that couple and might be even enjoy their company, but I‚Äôd fight touch and nail to stop them from moving into my town.The Israelis won‚Äôt let non-Jews ‚Äì no matter how smart or nice ‚Äì move to Israel and become citizens. Israel is their town and it‚Äôs going to stay that way.

            Two things stand out to me right now about today‚Äôs kids vs. my cohorts (high school class of ‚Äô89).  One is that they don‚Äôt care about driving.  I got my permit the day of my 16th birthday and had my license 2 months later.  A friend was telling me that his 17 year old son asked him to move his car out of the driveway so he could shoot hoops.  The guy said, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the keys, you can do it,‚Äù but the kid flat out refused to even move his dad‚Äôs car 50 feet.  That would have been unfathomable behavior to me and my friends in 1987 but I hear stories like that all the time.As for drinking, we did it early and often.  Before school, during lunch, sometimes in class, on weekends for sure.  I vividly remember going to Mass one Sunday morning at the age of 15 and praying fervently to God that I would moderate myself if he would just alleviate my hangover a tad.  My high school was state champs in baseball my junior year and our two star pitchers were both well-known lushes.  I currently have a nephew who‚Äôs a junior in high school and another nephew teaching and coaching (track/CC) in the same school.  From what I‚Äôve observed, the drinking just doesn‚Äôt happen like it used to.  It‚Äôs hard to do 12 oz. curls when you‚Äôve got a phone in one hand and an X-box controller in the other.My point is that there is certainly a different wiring in today‚Äôs kids that probably presents an opportunity for un-pozzing.  They‚Äôre more lost than indoctrinated.

                I remember spending my high school days (1980s) trying to get laid.  Teenage boys today are more into just hanging out with their male friends.  I‚Äôm not sure if this a good development or not.  I also don‚Äôt see much drinking, but I do see a bit of vaping and marijuana use.  We used to smoke joints, but the stuff today used in ‚Äúone hitters‚Äù is so much stronger.

                I‚Äôve noticed this and have done a lot of thinking about it. Fundamentally it seems to come down to independence vs dependence. A related fundamental could also be individual responsibility vs shared responsibility. Whatever it is, it‚Äôs  not a good sign when a young person lacks ambition for independence.

            Citizen,Wondering if in your community most of the families remained geographically stable as well? Not a lot of relocating?I‚Äôve noticed that the kids who remain in the area where they grew up and remain in contact with the friends of their youth marry a lot younger and start having kids a lot younger. Once someone in their circle gets married they all want to settle down. Once some start having kids it turns into a baby derby.  Having a stable community from one generation to the next does a lot in making sure people have an interest in family formation.

                Ironically, the kids in the area do tend to stick in the area. I say ironically because I live in the DC area which is famous for being transient, but that reputation is more for the young people working on the Hill. For people who stick around the area and have families, their kids (second generation vampires if you will) tend to stay in the DC area.Even the kids who head off to colleges out of state usually come back to the DC area. In some ways, it makes sense. DC has a lot of jobs for highly educated kids. The area has money and permanent industries. Also, the District along with Bethesda, North Arlington and the general Old Town Alexandria area are some big time pretty people places of the country. Finally, there are a lot of young people around.What hurts their baby making ability is the cost of living, but families often help their kids with down payments. (Yes, DC area people suck the blood out of the country to give their children so they can start life with a good job and a house that no one moving from Kansas could afford. We‚Äôre evil without even knowing it.) A few years back I noticed a big-time trend to have three kids whereas Gen Xers tended to go with two.Z talks about it, but it‚Äôs hard to overestimate how oblivious whites in the DC area are about their situation. I mean, outside of some of the outer suburbs, we completely missed the housing bubble. (My house in Arlington never lost value in 2007 or 2008 and went up in value in 2009.) We also waltzed right through the last recession. It just wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal.And don‚Äôt get me started on the stunning number of kids of parents with either security clearance or who work for the intelligence agencies who also go to work for firms that require security clearance or for the intelligence agencies. It‚Äôs a family business these days.

        If you want to end feminism then become a masculine man, take a wife, and raise your children with the beliefs you want them to have. Teach your sons to be men and fathers and teach your daughters to be wives and mothers.The problem is most guys don‚Äôt want to end feminism. Because ending it means taking responsibility. They want a mommy government and they want a mommy wife who they can fall back on should they stumble.They also have no idea how to be masculine. Instead they larp it. Guys now purchase a masculine looking identity with time in the gym and taking mma classes. They then crow about this masculine looking identity they have purchased, seeking the validation of others around them; a decidedly feminine trait.Plenty of men have decided we are done with the feminism we were raised with. Plenty of women want to be done with it as well. They just can‚Äôt be found by a man who grants validation rather than desires it.

The first error of any married man is to believe his wife gives a sh*t about his feelings.
You are more alone in marriage than as a single man, since she will actively test you to try and get rid of the male network you used as emotional support if she disapproves of them.

                Chet ‚Äì You raise a key point.  While typically people think of women and their gaggle of frenemies, I have always noticed most guys  ‚Äì normal guys ‚Äì have a true male network.  Friends from high school sports, friends from college classes, friends and coworkers from adult life.  They tend to carry that network with them throughout life.  I am much more a loner than most women and my husband and I are genuine friends too ‚Äì but your average woman (to be avoided like the plague) will tell you her best friend is her mom.

                    It is a genetic thing
Human beings have evolved to live in packs of about 40-50 people.  The men may hate each other individually, but they have to co-operate‚Äîotherwise, they will be killed by prey, or starve to death or meet another similar calamity. Men are genetically wired to cooperate and form networks.
A woman‚Äôs job is to have babies and all the other women in the pack  are her competition‚Ä¶ competition in getting impregnated and competition for the male‚Äôs attention/protection/food/taking care of the kid.   Women are genetically wired to hate other women.

                @Chet ‚Äì
Been married a long time, happily ‚Äì a successful marriage in all ways to a smart, beautiful, and caring woman.
She does not care at all about my feelings. If ever I shed a tear, there had better be a dead relative ‚Äì and a close one, not like a cousin or some sissy ish like that. The worst thing a woman can be is unfaithful, the worst thing a man can be is weak ‚Äì neither can be tolerated. That‚Äôs how it is.

            That‚Äôs rather risky when you live in a country where any woman can call 911 and have her husband permanently removed from his home and asset-stripped by a court system that is 100.00% rigged against him.
You need to make clear that if that happens, they‚Äôll never find her body.
And those women are lucky. Most slowly go insane under gynocracy because the only men unafraid to roger them are broke-ass vagabonds with prison tattoos.

            Out here in the far reaches of Indian Territory, hard, manual work and skilled labor are a real and visible thing.  Guys work here.  They drive dirty trucks with expensive, custom-built beds on the back housing huge tool boxes, welders and cutting rigs and the like.  Lunchtime on the Main Street of the small town I spend daylight hours in is marked by rows of these things angled into curbside parking.  Saw nothing like this in the trendy and expanding Nevada urban area I left 18 months back.I also notice that these guys don‚Äôt sport the cultivated, Adonis-like physiques you see on striving young urban hipster males.  They are often big, with thick bodies and burned skin.  Or they are smaller, wiry and burned brown, and most are wearing torn and dirty work clothes.  You see them on the weekends in the local diners (or you did before corona lockdown), wife and three kids in tow.  Solid, measured and responsible men.Yep, there are marijuana dispensaries on every street corner in the downtown area of the small town and county seat closest to my home.  And there are lots of houses falling in, in some of the neighborhoods of that town, and in the hamlets I pass through on my way to my daily activities.  But at many of those worn out houses there are new pickups, and company trucks.  Lots have American flags (yes, I know ‚Ä¶) outside, and trailers carrying tractors, mowers and the like.  But a good portion of these guys seem to work ‚Ä¶ hunt and fish, and take care of their families.  Priorities, I guess.And one final observation ‚Ä¶. there are lots of thin, not-ugly women here, hooked up with these beefy working dudes.  Where I lived for a yr before in Virginia, in the more rural, working-class areas, both men and women tended toward fat.  Working, generally, but overweight.  Here, I see females who in my former AO would all be trading on their looks for lifestyle and material possessions ‚Äî trophy life.  Here, I‚Äôve seen truly good looking girls happily tucked together with a working guy. ‚Ä¶. and their kids ‚Ä¶.??? Go figure.

                Here also in the Indian Territory, my son, who in a different life would be getting a Ph.D. in English, is a welder and very happy with his choice.  He loves coming home dirty and grimy and tired.  He eschews all the trendy labels, ‚Äúincel‚Äù ‚Äúgamma whatever‚Äù and the like, and instead lives his life confident that there is a young woman who will come along who is not a brainwashed, temperamental, shrieking harpy.  Reading Mises and Solzhenitsyn in the evenings, he continues his education on his own.I feels sorry for parents and their harried, worn-out kids who think getting into Harvard is the be-all end-all.  So many of these young men would be much the better off if they spent their early twenties employed with some skill or trade, but instead they deliver sandwiches, hoping that the world is once more going to become hospitable to liberal arts majors.

                    This place has some real attractions, with a few real things that keep you on your toes.  I know why the trendy hipsters don‚Äôt congregate out here, and why they gave it to the Indians back in the early 1800s ‚Ä¶. before they discovered oil, that is.  It‚Äôs still a rough land.  Earth-hammering storms (and tornados), poisonous snakes in the yard, brown recluse spiders in the bed and on your clothes.  I wasn‚Äôt prepared for that last one, coming from forty years in the high desert.  This place grows hardy, reality-oriented men ‚Ä¶. and women.  With all that, it still feels to me the most like pre-1968 America.  I‚Äôm glad for your son.  Long ago I got the liberal arts degree, and spend over there decades in the military as a result.  Fortunately, I had a background in trades ‚Ä¶ now, over 60, I‚Äôm in school learning another.

I don‚Äôt blame -any- man with assets and something to lose for taking a hard pass today. It isn‚Äôt just a matter of being rejected you can literally be thrown in prison on nothing more than an accusation.

            Living your convictions is hard, until it‚Äôs not. Once outside the modern narrative, clarity about their lies comes in waves, almost daily. My wife took a little longer for me to wake her up, but now she‚Äôs a traditionalist. Coming from a hardcore California .We watch a lot of Little House On the Prairie around here (3 homeschooled kids) and a recent episode was relevant to your post, and really struck me. Mrs. Ingles was going on a trip and conveyed confidence in Laura that she could hold down the fort, as a homemaker, while she was away. The confidence beaming from Laura‚Äôs face, at having that ‚Äúhomemaker‚Äù responsibility, was beautiful to see. I mentioned that to my wife, how proud I would be to see our daughter grow to be a great wife and mother. My wife agreed‚Ä¶that‚Äôs how I know we are on the right track.My wife and I regularly discuss growing our boys into great men (gauged by husbandry and fatherhood) but we wonder where will the solid wife options be? The same is true for our daughter as a future wife and mom. They will all be a ‚Äúcatch‚Äù‚Ä¶None of the girl power silliness around here.

        From your pen to God‚Äôs ears.  Our Thing has really been missing a trick here.  As you‚Äôve written before, the Poz is really just the weaponization of unattached females.  Why, then, have we not weaponized unattached males?  All those potential storm troopers (it‚Äôs a *metaphor*, NSA goons) just sitting in their Moms‚Äô basements spanking it.  Get them out there on the Internets, mocking the barren cat ladies.  The Left only wins because their goon squad has more free time ‚Äî you have a job, Trigglypuff doesn‚Äôt, so Trigglypuff can spend all the hours you‚Äôre working scheming to get you.

                Well, I‚Äôm not so sure. Over the last year or so I have been interacting with the young guys into the Fuentes/Casey/AmNat/Groyper stuff. I think there is plenty to work with, but what we lack is older guys ready to talk to these young guy as men and provide good examples. Too often, middle-aged guys talk to young guys like they are children. That never works. Or, they simply ignore them.We have not outlawed nature. Older guys need to do their part and nature will do the rest for the young guys coming into dissident politics. It‚Äôs why in real life activity is key. It‚Äôs also why our enemies work so hard to prevent us from gathering in real life and the virtual life.

                    This is the result of tearing down our civil institutions and just generally mucking up society.  It used to be that there was a lot of contact between generational males and younger guys could learn from the older guys. This was particularly true in work, especially at male type jobs, so much of which are gone.

                        Good point. When I was a young guy, I worked construction in the summer. The older guys would bust the balls of the young guys, but they also taught the young guys how to be one of the men in the process. Your first week on the job site as a sixteen year old was a little intimidating. By the July you were just one of the guys. You had responsibilities and you knew how to do stuff that needed to be done. Your confidence grew as a result.

                            I can see that. I never worked construction, but there was a very similar dynamic in the military, particularly the infantry. Green privates, kids, really, who jumped into Panama and came back same rank but with a Combat Infantry Badge were one of the old guys around the barracks. It‚Äôs an extreme example, but I think the process of men having to ‚Äúprove‚Äù one‚Äôs self to the collective whole has been lost.

                    Good morning Zman,Older men ARE stepping up to teach the youngermen ‚Äî they‚Äôre teaching them by their life experiencesthat women as a gender are, emotion driven hags thatCANNOT be trusted in anything they claim, or say andthat ‚Äògood little woman of yours‚Äô WILL turn on you outof the blue to utterly destroy your life and all that youworked for because..the Christian ‚ÄòSocial Gospel Movement‚Äôran amuck to create the scourge of feminism‚Ä¶because‚Ä¶.vagina!!During the last year have you also spent any appreciable time tointeract with men who have adopted and integrate the philosophyof Men Gowing Their Own Way ‚Äì MGTOW?  Many falsely assumethat MGTOW is a mere opposite of feminism which is absolutelynot true.  Men who make the conscious decision ‚Äòto walk away‚Äô AREN‚ÄôT trying to plead in public for a ‚Äòfair and level playing field‚Äôin regards to the laws that dominate both the ‚ÄòDivorce Court‚Äô, letalone that torture house known as ‚ÄòFamily Court‚Äô; the ‚ÄòMen‚Äôs RightsActivists‚Äô ‚Äì MRA‚Äôs tried that for years with NO appreciable positive results ‚Äî in fact all that they got for their effort was to be officially labled a ‚ÄòHate Group‚Äô by both the SPLC and ADL.Why?‚Ä¶Because women currently ARE 56% of the electorate ‚Äî THEY decide what goes or doesn‚Äôt go either politically or judicially in America.  And the  politicians irregardless of their ‚Äòparty‚Äô absolutelydo pander shamelessly to women as a voting block.How many men reading this current topic have been:‚ÄòDivorce raped‚Äô and lost 70% or more of their savings, propertyor home to their former spouse via divorce court because‚Ä¶.vagina!Had their children used as a weapon against them bytheir former spouse and/or had custody given to thespouse by the ‚ÄòFamily Court‚Äô (even if she was a mentallyill, confirmed lying, cheating cunt on crack) because‚Ä¶vagina!Been forced to pay ‚Äùchild extortion‚Äù for 18 years per child(depending on their age) even if it is proven that saidchildren AREN‚ÄôT his (that his spouse cheated behind hisback and got pregnant from her secret ‚Äòfuckbuddy‚Äô ‚Äì soshe commits a second crime ‚Äì fraud, on top of the primaryone ‚Äì adultry).  Over 1/3rd of all children currently bornARE literal bastards ‚Äì and the former husband IS on thehook wrongfully to pay for their upkeep.If the wife or girlfriend IS cheating on him, there‚Äôs thevery real possibility of her contracting any number ofSTD‚Äôs from her ‚Äòfuckbuddy‚Äô and passing it on to herhusband (and no, a majority of women DON‚ÄôT gettested nor are they at all honest with their husbandsabout being positive for an STD).  She plays around‚Ä¶rolls the dice‚Ä¶and now you and her have‚Ä¶HIV!!!Been falsely accused by the spouse or girlfriend of:‚ÄòDomestic Abuse‚Äô‚ÄúRape‚Äùor any other outright horseshit that rests in the debunkedbut still used ‚ÄòDuluth Model‚Äô, because‚Ä¶.vagina!Had their character and standing in the communitydestroyed by the spouse or girlfriend‚Äôs false accusationsresulting in the man loosing his job or career, because,‚Ä¶‚Äúbelieve ALL women‚Äù‚Ä¶vagina!Have a wife or girlfriend one day go ‚Äòbatshit violent psycho‚Äôon you and attack you with anything she can get her handson with the intent of either maiming or killing you.Ask Travis Alexander how this worked out for himcourtesy of his girlfriend, Jodi Arias.Here‚Äôs an excellent definition of MGTOW:M.G.T.O.W ‚Äì Men Going Their Own Way is a statement of self-ownership, where the modern man preserves and protects his own sovereignty above all else. It is the manifestation of one word: ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Ejecting silly preconceptions and cultural definitions of what a ‚Äúman‚Äù is. Looking to no one else for social cues. Refusing to bow, serve and kneel for the opportunity to be treated like a disposable utility. And, living according to his own best interests in a world which would rather he didn‚Äôt.sov¬∑er¬∑eign¬∑tyÀàs√§v(…ô)r…ôn(t)ƒì/Noun. Meaning: Supreme power or authority. Autonomy, independence, self-government, self-rule, self-determination, freedom. Self-governing.https://www.mgtow.com/about/Or we can look at it from an equally validpersonal realization:Men have seriously looked at these and other reallandmines that all potentially lurk in having any sortof ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô with women, and more and more menare saying, ‚ÄúThanks but NO thanks!, I‚Äôm not your punchingbag, your emotional tampon, your walking ATM and notyour ‚ÄòKnight in Shinning Armor‚Äô!  I don‚Äôt need you to createmy self-worth and I don‚Äôt need you to validate my existence!!I‚Äôm charting my OWN course in life and deciding what mattersto me ‚Äî and you‚Äôre NOT part of that anymore!!Here‚Äôs an excellent documentary created by HammerhandThe MGTOW Monk which showcases several men who‚Äôveadopted the MGTOW philosophy to speak to you and othermen who aren‚Äôt MGTOW (or at least not yet‚Ä¶800,000 divorcesa year certainly is something to take note of..)Hammerhand‚Äôs The MGTOW Movie ‚Äì 2019https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYTDG4nUWNI&amp;bpctr=1586276298Allowing women the wholly un-earned privilege of votinga century ago along with their using that vote to both createthe welfare state (and enlarge the size of government so asto increase said welfare state) to benefit them has provenitself a unmittigated disaster for America (universal suffrageitself is a failure).It should surprise no one that enough men have ‚Äòlearnedthe hard way‚Äô and have decided ‚Äúto go their own way‚Äù.They AREN‚ÄôT coming back either ‚Äî there is literally NOrational incentive for any of them to do so.The only rational solution is three-fold:1. Take women‚Äôs rights away (NO voting rights whatsoever).2. Stop empowering women (No education past high schooland no job outside of the home!)3.   End ALL welfare, both domestic and international.Done swiftly and properly, over 90% of America‚Äôs othersocial problems WILL end.Unfortunately it‚Äôs unlikely to be implemented as only 12%of men in America currently say that women have TOOmany rights, while 88% either think women have just theright amount of rights or that women need MORE rights.This is the reality that we find ourselves currently in.And the ‚ÄòGynocracy‚Äô is going to be a very bitchydragon to slay, but it must be slain if America is tohave any future.NorthGunner ‚Äì The Truth Is It‚Äôs OWN Defense!

Oh, and I‚Äôm one of them. Confirmed by genetic test. Which was interesting given I should be able to tan but the swiss-german mennonite and scandi prevent it. At least I didn‚Äôt end up in a pail or medical incinerator like other GenX.

                                I‚Äôve seen 1 in 12 as the average for those doing genetic testing finding out they are bastards. I was going to say that the vibrants would probably rate higher, but they aren‚Äôt pay out -of-pocket for genetic testing and they also marry less so the point is moot.

                        Excellent post, almost an infomercial! I‚Äôm on board with the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust women‚Äù bandwagon. I was an incel before it was cool, have generally had bad experiences with women (my own personality could not be a factor, could it? Naaaw! üòÄ ) But in any case I haven‚Äôt paid for a bad (or good) marriage and kids. Perhaps, already my late 50s, I will escape. And while my sex drive is not what it was in my younger days, being alone makes me proud to be able to take matters into my own hands :*)

                From here now in America‚Äôs hinterlands, after thirty+ yrs in the military/govt complex and living and working at the verge of urban-rural America, and spending much time peering into the governing swamp‚Äì I can tell you that there is something going on out here with the 18-30 yr old males I now work with daily.  They know something is wrong.  They don‚Äôt really know what it is.  Most have little to no historical or cultural knowledge.  But they know it‚Äôs wrong, bad for them and threatens our future.

                    I am dubious that much of Gen X and the Millenials can be rehabilitated.  As a Gen Xer, I was on the front-line of the PC battles and lost (took couple of D‚Äôs in college and graduate school for my efforts).  My cohort was standing in the path of the glorious future.
Late stage Millenials (Fuentes) and Gen Z are approaching the gynocracy from a different perspective.  They are fighting a new war with 20 years of evidence supporting them.
I‚Äôll ponder the leadership concept . . .

                        The Islamic ‚Äúheaven‚Äù, in reality, was R&amp;R camps where the hired raiders would get the rewards denied to civilians.Fight for Islam and you can go to Heaven.Rivers of wine, feasts of honeyed dates, and yes, those 28 smooth-faced boys.Most Koranic quotes are chopped off in the middle.

In ‚Äúdawa‚Äù, soft war or gaslighting, the inconvenient details are left out.Islam is a rape machine for force-breeding soldiers.

How to reach them?Where to recruit?Got the tools?
We‚Äôre talking hobby circles and trade skillz.If older guys can put out the call, younger men will naturally be drawn, and the hunting band can begin.
But how?  A template, a checklist, a business presentation?  Support services?

        I hope that you are right Z man but gynocracy is like a drug to today‚Äôs young men. Being cared for inside the home by doting parents and single women while getting easy sex outside the home.Or lacking sex, free pornography.I am an older fart.But I remember watching Phil Donahue back in my younger days when they had feminists on back in the 70‚Äôs. I remember how blind I thought they all were and how it all would lead to disaster.We have not got to the disaster part yet.Maybe the Navy crew taking the side of the wimpy Captain of the USS Roosevelt is a sign the disaster is coming.The Chinese and Russian militaries are cold SOB‚Äôs. Our feminized culture may not hold up so good to them.

                True, but my guess is not quite so much. The Chinese police dragging their citizens around by the hair is a sign. Also it appears that Putin is embracing traditional Russian Orthodox culture to some extent.The eastern bloc nations like Hungary certainly are not falling for our intersectional crap.At least not as much as we fall for it.

                    Good point. Based upon my very shaky understanding of history as expressed by Fukuyama ‚ÄúThe Origins of Political Order‚Äù, we should expect more adherence to tradition (patriarchy, so far as I know) especially in the Chinese case. I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúdata‚Äù for Russia, but surely closer to Asian traditions. China is not going to give up several thousand years of social cohesion based upon a powerful central authority, a Byzantine bureaucracy and very strong resistance to change and outside influence easily, any more than the indigenous of Africa could be easily lifted out of the Stone Age into the modern world. It is only the high-achieving but entirely too idealistic for his own good European that would imagine such things likely üòÄ

            G Lordon;Re the Navy fiasco, as a long retired mid-senior non-navy CO, my take for what it‚Äôs worth (FWIW), is that you‚Äôre reversing the casualty.  It really is the Captains fault, not that the crew are wusses (even if they are).  He‚Äôs supposed to be the grown-up in charge, after all.IMHO (in my humble opinion) the entire fiasco was apparently kicked off and furthered by said removed Captain trying too hard to be the crew‚Äôs buddy instead of focusing on his ship‚Äôs mission. Had he not made the port call in Vietnam (where the virus was likely picked up), none of this likely would have happened.  You have to believe that there was crew agitation behind this port call.  I suspect that my 20 year-old self would have been in the thick of agitation had I been in the Navy.It was already known (or should have been) at the time that something really hinkey was afoot in the PRC that looked like a re-run of several other virus epidemics (SARS, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, etc.) engendered there.  Any port‚Äôs sailor amusements in Asia have Chinese involved.  The annual Chinese New Year travels were in progress, so there was going to be a direct virus pipeline.  The only thing dumber would have been to go to Kowloon or anywhere else in the PRC itself.He then compounded his folly by circulating a 4 page missive with no classification marks to 20+ addressees in unclassified channels laying out in so many words that his ship was NMC (not mission capable).  That sure-to-become-public notice was why he should have been relieved of command.

        Ironically, I think I knew the gynocracy was doomed when I read that Hanna Rosin book crowing about the victory of women over men. It‚Äôs all anecdotal, very weak, and a parody that no one took seriously, even those the book was intended to flatter (Rosin is proof that there are some very, very stupid Jews). I always suspected the book was frankly an extended bedroom game (what the Germans call ‚ÄúWeibermacht‚Äù) between Rosin and her husband David Plotz, in which the public was made into unwitting voyeurs. She‚Äôs a dead-ringer for Rosa Luxemburg; alas, she probably won‚Äôt end her days floating in the Landwehr Canal, though she‚Äôs destined to be heaped on the pyre of her failed revolution with her other (((sisters))). I think people have had enough. I pray people have had enough.

America has been a frailer place ever since.But the slow bleeding started at the family level.A man working his own farm or small business works long hours but in America‚Äôs tender years, he generally worked them with his family.  The Industrial Age kept him from home for 12+ hours a day while women stayed, shrewing in their own juicyness and arranging the daylight world of children alone.Contra xrl science, by effectively reducing man-hours of family time to 4-6 hours of wakefulness between quitting time and getting up to do it again, the patriarchy had already been defeated.  It was only a matter of time.The old dimorphic roles of hunting vs. hearth-keeping were being deepened and reinforced while also being proclaimed as relics of the Before Times.  This cognitive dissonance between the real and the reeee-ified has been making us hysterical ever since.And yet we called it Progress and even Prosperity.The quality of parenting and the strength of family ties could not help but erode in the face of this iron practicality and the more we scaled up, the more we ‚Äúexponentialized‚Äù the flaws in the atomizing extended family structure, which we portentiously called nuclear.Nuclear as in ‚Äúdecaying.‚ÄùThe half-life of the nuclear family occurred with the postwar spread of secretarial make-work jobs.  Even the most fundamental nucleus could not withstand constant (((bombardment))) with both parents contributing a mere 4-6 wakeful hours of parenting.  Both the strong force of fatherhood and the weak-but-equally-essential force of motherhood were required to keep the nucleus stable.  As they failed, the nucleus began to come apart.Adultery and divorce skyrocketed as atomized mom and dad units were Gamed and Eat Pray Love‚Äôd by workday cads and seductresses.  Legacy parenting skills were not passed on and each successive generation grew further apart and further debased.We built a civilization of skyscrapers and satellites on the sandy eroding shoreline of post-parental families.   What did we expect?As Wile E. Coyote said, gravity‚Äôs a bitch.

            This can not be repeated enough. Man in service to the economy is an inversion of nature. You can add to your points the destruction of the multi-generational family. If men did have to be absent because they were soldiers, seamen, hunters, transporters etc. there were plenty of grandfathers, uncles, brothers, etc to pick up the slack.
Who runs our institutions is certainly a problem but what had become of our institutions is at least as critical.

        Got some more stuff from the medical department about how this virus is going to change things. Telemedicine.My expectation is that this will become a new normal to some degree. It fits the whole Amazon-Uber-Door Dash zeitgeist. My healthcare app is interactive and there‚Äôs a real person at the other end! Maybe this one will have a good bitside manner.Been doing it in our practice now for a couple of weeks, since it became legal to bill for it. Previously the encounter had to be recorded video (both ends) over HIPPA-compliant devices to be reimbursable. Now, it can be a cell phone call as related by one participant.As a professional and a man of his word, I‚Äôm glad they trust me in this way. As a student of human nature I‚Äôm imagining the necessary algorithms to spit out plausible, billable encounters by the ream.First thing the blue-pencils note is the quantum leap in reimbursement at 20 minutes. All of the patients I‚Äôve ‚Äòseen‚Äô have taken at least that long, but what else do I have to do? It‚Äôs slow, molasses-slow at many practices, and I enjoy talking to patients anyway. Normally, against the clock, that‚Äôs a liability of sorts.It is kind of cool to invent workarounds in trying to make these encounters effective. Lots of people have an accurate blood pressure cuff at home. (A rich country can afford such things, a fact that should not be overlooked as we impoverish ourselves.) I had a patient who may be having a GI bleed but he shouldn‚Äôt go to the hospital unless it‚Äôs hemodynamically active at this point. He took and showed me his BP and pulse lying, sitting, standing. He passed this test. Others are pending. It feels nice to be clever.But this ain‚Äôt medicine. This is like trying to fully appreciate the David by looking at its shadow. This is the husk left after the patient encounter has been digitized and monetized.We hear all the time about the percentage of communication that is non-verbal. We know the qualitative difference between looking at a 2D photo and a 3D object. We have an innate desire to touch things to learn more about them. The doctor will see you now, through a glass darkly.Do not forget that another definition of ‚Äòvirtually‚Äô is ‚Äòalmost but not quite‚Äô.Sir William Osler is credited with putting medicine formally and finally on a scientific base a little over a hundred years ago. In the late nineteenth century most anyone could set up a med school. He put an end to that and founded residency training. He also said, ‚ÄúHe who studies medicine without books, sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.‚ÄùMe and my virtual patients are sittin‚Äô high and dry.

            My wife and I have speculated what to do if we actually get sick from this thing.  Would our family doctor actually prescribe the medicine that works against this virus over the phone? Refer us to a specialist swamped beyond all capacity, or tell us to show up at a hospital?  If any except the first happened, he wouldn‚Äôt be our family doctor any longer.

                Drake ‚Äì The specific thing I‚Äôve discussed about covid with my husband is thatifI were to get so deathly ill as to require hospitalization, I would require a legally valid document refusing, under any circumstances, to be intubated.

                    I‚Äôve gotten my own basic will &amp; testament and powers of attorney stuff done, so I can opine‚Ä¶ If those are your wishes, you should be able to have ‚Äúno heroic measures‚Äù or whatever it is called, as well as customized wishes in your advance medical directive. Mine say basically no food no water but pain relief yes but only in terminal conditions.

                    My suspicion is that if you refuse a ventilator the doctor will give you a ‚Äúshot‚Äù to relief your suffering‚Äîgasping like a fish out of water‚Äîwhich will take care of such concerns very shortly.  With all respect to our good doctor posting here, what else can a physician do at that stage?

                        Compsci ‚Äì That‚Äôs precisely my point.  Even in the best of circumstances, most who go on a ventilator do not come off well if at all.  Perhaps Right Doctor can correct me, but I believe I‚Äôve read many doctors themselves would refuse intubation.  If I am that sick, ease my pain and let me go.

                            I would refuse it, but I am 66 and have at least one condition that will disable me in a few years (IBM). I have have a strong Christian faith and a loving wife. Kids and grandkids. I‚Äôve done my part. The world is less and less a place I want to live in. I‚Äôve seen lots of people die, talked to them as they did so. You‚Äôd be surprised how many don‚Äôt fight ‚Äì but then again, something that can kill you can strip your will to live.Some people are getting off ventilators with this. If I were younger I‚Äôd go for it. You are generally sedated and most people don‚Äôt recall that it was a time of suffering.Okay, to the point of someone gasping for air who refuses intubation, those patients have always been euthanized. We didn‚Äôt call it that forty years ago, but we did it. We called it compassion.

                The current advice is to minimize suspected covid cases‚Äô exposure to the world at large. If you called our office with the right/wrong symptoms, we would advise you where and how to get tested, and to self-quarantine pending the results. The quarantine would then be extended if they are positive. (The medical system would only be invoked if you got into respiratory difficulty, which is when you or proxy call 911 or the hospital and let them know the deal.) As far as prescribing, OTC meds for the symptoms would be recommended. There‚Äôs no accepted/recommended treatments at present. Don‚Äôt confuse press conferences with medical evidence.

            Anecdotal‚Ä¶ Wife got sick last week. Still sick. Not corona. Two ‚Äòtelemedicine‚Äô appointments resulting in several prescriptions, then finally they agreed to have her come into the office. One look in each ear and yep, very bad ear infections (tear ducts also infected). Had they started her on a course of antibiotics sooner she wouldn‚Äôt have been in so much pain the past 3 days, but they kept saying give the prednisone time to work (it probably made the bacterial infections worse, since it suppresses the immune system).Telemedicine might be an okay first-line for the hypochondirac patient. Not for someone actually sick.This corona panic has made people seeking help for *regular* illness much harder to get. It‚Äôs insane.

            Doc;Virtual could well be the future for follow-ups.  Just had a 6 month one and it worked very well.  But then again I didn‚Äôt really need it (but who knows this in advance_?)Virtual obviously wouldn‚Äôt work well for an initial appointment with no records on hand.  So maybe an 80:20 system could evolve with in-person visits interspersed with virtual follow-ups.  OTOH, one could look at the white spots on anybody‚Äôs Little Timmy‚Äôs throat via a hi-res selfie and Rx the Amoxicillin over the phone, I suppose.BTW, in the unlikely case you didn‚Äôt know, it is now possible to get a reliable remote 6 lead/trace EKG in addition to remote BP readings.  One of the EKG devices on offer below will go Bluetooth to an electronic BP monitor and upload that data along with the EKG.  Add a Bluetooth reporting scale (the horror_!) and maybe you‚Äôre there.https://www.alivecor.comCould be a real business opportunity to gather most important, routine  diagnostic data remotely.  Trick would be to place *your own* (proprietary_?) instrument set in your (now) tied-in patients‚Äô homes.  One could theoretically configure a patient‚Äôs set based on the conditions being monitored.  Viola, Concierge Medicine (at lower than current concierge rates_?) would now be possible for the middle class.  Insurance Co‚Äôs hardest hit.Don‚Äôt know about Blood Panels though: Elisabeth Holmes Theranos scam blowing up would make raising Venture Capital for a legit technology pretty hard for now.

        One can just picture Shlomo reading your essay, and by the time he gets to paragraphs 4 ‚Äì 7, the gleeful hand-rubbing has reached such high speeds that Shlomo begins to travel through time.  Imagine his disappointment when you get to the faint Rays of hope at the end.Rest assured though, rule by patriarchal men will return to America‚Ä¶ it just won‚Äôt be rule by White men.  The majority of Mexican and Muslim women are ugly as a horse head full of eels, but they are feminine, fertile, and are realistic about what their role in life is.  They may clean office cubicles at night, but they are the cubicles of shrewish dried-up White harridans who have no pictures of children on their desks.  Mexican and Muslim men are masculine, and know they are the heads of their households, and they also know that their sons will outnumber the soyboys, and will rule over them and take their women.Where I live all the Mexican and Muslim women are stay at home trad-wives, and they and their unlimited babies spend their days clogging up the public libraries which they have turned into nurseries, or else waddling from market to market pushing strollers and trailed by four toddlers.  The Muslim men each take the standard allowable four wives, but only one is legally married on paper; the other three are acknowledged by the community, but as a matter of law they are unmarried ‚Äúsingle mothers‚Äù, and can max out all possible public benefits accordingly.You are paying for Shlomo‚Äôs plan to destroy you, and Shlomo‚Äôs plan is proceeding exactly on schedule.  And if it comes in early and under budget, be sure that Shlomo will also pocket the surplus.

            Mexican and Muslim men are masculine‚Ä¶
Have you met many Moslem men? Most of them are lazy, untrustworthy, histrionic, passive-aggressive cunts that can‚Äôt handle criticism, are congenitally unable to take responsibility for their fukkups, and will ragequit a job the first time they are reprimanded by a kuffar boss. Also, they scream a lot, which is just about the worst you can do for face-loss in Scandinavia: ‚Äúget your emotions under control, you absolute child!‚Äù
Arabs are the worst, but they‚Äôre all on the spectrum.

                Here our brown skinned neighbors have a unique ability to work in this godless heat.  I‚Äôll give them that.  Ragequiting is not unknown however.  I always attributed it to basically the situation that when you are at that low a level employment-wise, jobs are plentiful and it matters little when you quit or get fired.  There‚Äôs little to lose, you just move on to the next minimum wage position.

                Somehow, taking the Bible literally never came about for me.  Went to Catholic parochial schools all my life.  Never remember any religious teaching which deemed to interpret the Bible literally.  Indeed, I remember instruction in interpreting times, dates, events in a more figurative manner.  Also, there was no estrangement between science and reason, and biblical interpretation.  Evolution was never contradicted either.  That was as early as the 60‚Äôs.

Nothing is as new as we think.‚ÄúReckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.‚ÄùSome forms of Protestantism have done a lot of damage. Most are ancient heresies all dressed up again. Not saying the Catholics have all the answers.

        The effect of the gynocracy on males has been absolutely stunning. With the number of sports retail stores that have stopped selling guns and the shutdown of many retail franchise gun stores in CA I stumbled upon an independent gun store that was run out of a garage like structure in an industrialized area.In CA it is very hard to experience a white male working class/redneck environment. Most of the car shops and construction companies have a white male owner and Latino workers. The workers in this gun shop were all white male mechanics, ex military, or ex police. I  literally felt like I was on another planet.I have lived in redneck areas growing up and primarily worked in corporate or academic settings. The facial structure, voice tonal structure, and attitudinal differences between these men and the vast majority of men in my work environments was night and day.  I literally felt like I had stumbled upon an alternate universe of a 1950‚Äôs style cool Brando biker bar.

                The one I stumbled upon is in a densely populated metro beach county area of So Cal. So San Fran and So Cal; who would have thunk.
The experience is difficult for me to explain because it was so mind-altering. I simply had not been in a work environment of ONLY white (real) men in so long I had forgotten what it felt like. I think the last time was when I worked a summer break job during college for a construction firm in the mid-West back in the early 1970s.

        For those not familiar with early 80s British comedy. The two ronnies ran a series called the ‚Äúworm that turned‚Äù as a documenting of a comic rebellion against a fascistic society of control.
Interestingly it was a women dominated control fascism and men were forced to wear skirts and use female names, while women took over all the male roles and ended up running a police state. Well worth a watch.

            Yeah if you want to know all about it, just read the OT.  Adam and Eve, Samson and Delilah, Jezebel, Isaiah, etc.  But it‚Äôs a western thing, of course!
When I think of western female villains I think of witches. Harpies not so much.  Power players not subverters.

                ‚ÄúWitch‚Äù is a useful epithet. Wahmen don‚Äôt like it. Being socially acceptable‚Äîpartly because they think the concept exalts them‚Äîit still gets under their skin. Possibly because only one letter needs to be changed‚Ä¶and they REALLY don‚Äôt like that one.

                Well said. The Femme Fatale is a trope. I think it was Helen Gurley Brown who said (MOL) ‚ÄúThe power of our [sex] has toppled kings and lesser men.‚Äù Don‚Äôt under-estimate the power of the mysterious female. As Richard Pryor said, men fall out of one and spend the rest of their lives trying to get back inside. Jeez, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have installed a fence, a barricade with warning signs and flashing lights, around such a public nuisance: a hole so treacherous that men fall into and out of it!

            I think they view it as a Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (without understanding that reference).  Once bad white man is permanently put down, they plan to domesticate the Muslims.  How that will work without white men to do the dirty work is a mystery.

                    Speaking of pit bull rescue, has it ever been the case that young women haven‚Äôt brought home the wayward, wild boy, with the idea of taming him and making him hers?  A high school buddy, way back in the paleo era, larped as such a bad boy, and had more girlfriends than he knew what to do with.
Perhaps there is even a biological element to it.  That wild boy might be able to do a good job of protecting and providing in uncertain times, while the well-mannered ‚Äúgood‚Äù boy might be next to useless.

                        Perhaps due to the influence of romance novels where the virtuous maiden tames the wildboy ‚Äúrake‚Äù with the understanding that he will become a model husband.  Maybe, maybe not.
The idea that love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage is a modern idea.  Historically, marriage was first and foremost a business arrangement and love, if it existed in the marriage, came after.

            Good on you!  Seriously!It‚Äôs not merely boys growing up in the gynocracy into men unfit for their roles in marriage, it‚Äôs men who are very fit and have very much going on who simply don‚Äôt want their lives ruined by getting divorce raped out of a marriage or getting metoo‚Äôd or otherwise blacklisted for some form or another of political incorrectness.  While never reported in MSM and generally not talked about, these unpleasant eventualities happen in large numbers, with unacceptably high risk probabilities.  Self preservation instinct kicks in, and many worthy men avoid the risks to maintain a life worth living.  Even though generally not spoken about, this is one of the major factors, along with the more well known factors, substantially contributing to the declining marriage and fertility rates, as well as the declining numbers of men in ‚Äúhigher‚Äù education and female-dominated office workplaces.

            They picked the wrong season (but I suppose other timings drove that). If they had used 2018 season instead of pissing about on Russia they would have had 900k hospital cases and 80k dead to parade around. Bet they are kicking themselves for that.

            No matter what, the media is going to spin this as either we should have had more staying at home or social distancing, or, oh look, see how well these authoritarian measures worked.  A good measure of the strength of the gynocracy is how that big alpha in the White House had to make token gestures of acquiescence and obeisance to all this hysteria, while subtly signaling the rational that he thinks that this is mostly a bunch of hooey.

            I wonder if a single soul will tell them they overreacted. If they‚Äôll even consider it.
People will say it, but they‚Äôll be shouted down. In their heart of hearts, they will know they overreacted, but they will never, ever admit it or learn from it.

        Hope you‚Äôre right, Z-man, but there‚Äôs a lot of ruin in a gynocracy.  I think, however, that a tipping point will be reached where there are simply not enough competent men to keep the machines running and the lights on.

                Meme, I‚Äôm perplexed as well.  However, the amount of skill set needed to maintain a system is much less than that to develop, install, and expand a system.  Even at maintenance, it would seem SA has some visible cracks developing.  Cape Town and its water crisis is my current favorite.

                You need a few to keep things running. But you need a massive engineering capacity somewhere else to dig the  design/machine/upgrade all the parts. This idea that the machines will keep running is not sensible unless you want to envisage some perpetually jerry-rigged infrastructre going forwards.
Beyond a certain size large scale engineering is an ecosystem itself that 10 guys and know-how can‚Äôt reproduce without the appropriate IQ/skills manpower underneath them.

You need the know how to keep it going while things are failing all around. Most importantly, you need to have a healthy ability to see the system as essentially the opposite of magic, which most folks are incapable of doing.

                They do indeed, and individually they can be guided to the light.
But collectively?  They have mechanisms that keep them in line, and women value conformity much more highly then men.
Little things like #stayhome might roll off of our backs with zero notice, but when females see it everywhere it becomes gospel.

Women expect men to reign them in at times. Be a man, step up and take control of the situation. Of course, women don‚Äôt acknowledge that they‚Äôve created a society where men can lose everything if they do.

            My feeling is always that the phrase ‚Äúwomen and children‚Äù existed for good reason, and that if we are to fix this problem, the first thing to do is to take the blame for failing the ‚Äúshit test,‚Äù because blaming the women gives them too much agency. I‚Äôve even read some very beta comments from some nationalists/dissidents saying, ‚ÄúThis girl deserved to get raped because she converted to Islam‚Äù or something like that. No, the girl was a dumb child who was misled by evil women and abused by inbred mono-brow-afflicted sand savages. I start from the premise that it‚Äôs our fault, or at least our responsibility and that women need defending, even and perhaps especially from themselves.

        This is the beginning of the end for gynocracy but it will be a very ugly death.  Women need positive emotional feedback to keep their mood and hysteria in check. In the best of times this is no simple task. In ClownPozCollapseotopia it will be a 5 alarm fire. Having so many women in positions of power and influence at a time of disruption and collapse is a formula for a perfect storm.  Too many men are also fish out of water in the current milieu and will react as if they were women or worse in random outbreaks of violence that are misdirected and self destructive.Some sort of national dictatorship is probably unlikely.  Our rulers have just shown us how well suited they are to govern.Imagine them having to quell a 1000 riots or even 100.  We‚Äôll probably get some sort of regional and racial peeling off.  It will be chaotic with not infrequent violent outbreaks.  It will be ugly and it will be drawn out.  If you‚Äôre still living someplace where you should have already left it‚Äôs time to make a decision before that decision is made for you.Women will lose their influence in the public square but they won‚Äôt be able to find their natural place until men aggressively handle the task that‚Äôs about to be handed to them.

        I‚Äôm stunned at the lack of aggression young white men have today. In terms of career ambition, in terms of getting laid, in terms of generally doing things other than gaming. The guys we consider ‚Äúcocky‚Äù or ‚Äúfuckboys‚Äù today are pretty much average guys from the 90s and earlier. Outside the ‚Äúgame‚Äù people ‚Äì but they seem to be more 30 and 40 year olds who have been continually fucked over by women, or divorced.Watch some TV shows from the 90s or earlier (before the Friends betas). You‚Äôll be surprised at how manly the white men are. Or just interviews with men from the 70s and 80s.Most of my early 20s friends have pretty much given up on sex. The few who haven‚Äôt are mostly POCs who have an axe to grind against whitey so they have sex to demarcate their high status. This kind of behaviour would have been classified as ‚Äúlikely homosexual‚Äù 20 or 30 years ago.Anyways ‚Äì I hope white men can get their energy back but so far it seems like we‚Äôre just assimilating into the black / arab pile of dogshit. Thinking that rapping makes them masculine. We are so fucked, mainly due to beta fathers and single mothers.

        Reading, ‚ÄúMother Nature,‚Äù by Sarah Hrdy. Interesting little passage follows:‚ÄúAncient myths about an age when women ruled, only to be usurped and put in their proper place by men, are not su much literal history as reflections of the chronic tensions between paternal and maternal interests. Themes about men overthrowing female rule are rampant in the origin myths of ancient Greece, Amazonia, and the ancient Near East. This does not mean events like those described ever happened, but rather that conflicting interests between males and females, matrilineal and patrilineal interests, are perpetually at work.‚ÄùFascinating. Perhaps it was possible to think this way twenty years ago, but can anyone now doubt that the ancient myths are all literally true? That a gynocracy is a thing that naturally arises in human societies and that must be eliminated if that society is to advance? Why doubt the idea that, having solved the most pressing needs, the men prefer to let their guard down and allow the women to run the machine they built; relax a little, how bad can the chicks mess it up? Well‚Ä¶So they make myths about how the rule by wammins had to end to solve a plague or something so that future generations would not make the same mistake. And we never listen.

            Anansi And His Seven SistersorHow The Women Lost Their Teeth(As related by Ghanans in Lagos-on-the-Chesapeake)Long ago, women ruled the world.The men feared them, because they had two sets of teeth- one above, and one below!Anansi, the Spider, had seven sisters.Lazy and greedy, demanding and bitter, they were always complaining.‚ÄúAnansi, fetch us this!‚Äù  they cried.  ‚ÄúAnansi, bring us that!‚ÄùWith never a kind word for poor Anansi, nor for any man, for the men feared them.They had teeth down below!One day, poor Anansi came upon a bush filled with luscious berries.  Always hungry, (his sisters never fed him, nor any man) Anansi eagerly tried the berries.Sour!  They were so sour!  Poor Anansi!Anansi, stricken, came upon a plan.Anansi gathered all the berries he could hold, and took them to his home, the one he shared with seven sisters.‚ÄúAnansi!‚Äù they howled.  ‚ÄúWhere have you been! We have not eaten!  Now get to work!‚ÄùThey knew Anansi feared them, as did all men- for they had teeth down below!Poor Anansi made a huge pot of bubbling soup- soup made, from those very berries.His sisters, greedy and foolish, snatched up their bowls, and hungrily gobbled down their soup without a second thought.Sour! SO sour!  So very sour, their lips curled up, their mouths pinched- so sour, their bottom teeth fell right out!So sour, their bottom mouth remains wrinkled and curled to this very day!Still bitter and complaining, still selfish and greedy, but the men no longer fear them.For they have no teeth down below!

        To the Prog, society is a game of jenga. The entire point is to see how much they can remove and keep it standing. And like jenga you can‚Äôt put blocks back in the tower.
The problem is that women have a hard time finding a man to fulfill those trad dreams of hers. Decades of single motherhood and retreating fathers have left these men in short supply. As have a changing labor market that has destroyed industries that play to male strengths over women‚Äôs.
There is no fixing this, there is only collapse and rebuilding.

        For you young guys, get in a field that pays well and has &lt;10% women, and that percentage is not increasing. Then you can compete with other men and make enough to support a wife and kids. Also, don&#x27;t live in some ludicrously expensive and liberal place like CA or NYC.

                This ‚Äústatus‚Äù thing needs to be worked on.  In reality, the status today of a college degreed individual should be less than the status of a certified tradesmen.  And the tradesmen themselves might be the worse offenders in some cases.Years ago, The county redid all the roads inside the neighborhood.  A rare event in this bankrupt berg, but welcome.  The day came when they did the road immediately in front of our home.  I got the kids and the camera out to watch.  I commented on the work done, how the truck driver came behind the machine to spread and lay the asphalt.  The timing, the accuracy of regulating the dump truck pouring the hot asphalt out slowly, the huge paving roller machines spaced evenly across the road flattening and compacting the hot asphalt.Just as the whole system passed, the supervisor controlling the operation, hot, sweaty, dressed in safety gear and with radio came over to talk with the kids.  His statement, ‚Äú‚Ä¶stay in school, get a degree, and you won‚Äôt have to do work like this‚Ä¶‚Äù.OK, I know he meant well, but damn, in 30 seconds he destroyed a lesson I was trying to instill in the kids for the last hour‚Äîthat is to say, ‚Äúthere is dignity in work, all work, and especially hard work‚Äù.  Sigh.

                    Tail end of the 80‚Äôs I worked an air hammer in burned out structures and refractories without safety protection for $20/hr, sufficient then to feed a family, as a summer job. Come October I was still coughing up black soot after rugby practice back at university. I also was a skilled amateur software programmer but I hadn‚Äôt wanted to advertise myself as a nerd, the lowest of the low. However the black soot convinced me to apply to a part-time programming job on campus, they hired me, and I earned $20/hr in a cushy environment thence. I have never considered sooty work again. No apologies to Mike Rowe, who sometimes romanticizes grunt work. Although I do all my own home improvement work.

                        All people should attempt to improve their situation as time and talent dictate‚Äînothing wrong there.I worked as a fry cook before attending college.  One night, I was at a new job and two other cooks I was working with were talking.  They were like old white guys with gray hair.  I was a punk kid 19 or so.One said to the other that this was a pretty good job as they were getting $20 a shift.  Well, so was I, and whereas it kept me in gas and beer, there was no way I was going to wind up like those guys in their 50‚Äôs.  I registered at the State University that Spring and never looked back.My point in the previous comment was that there are all sorts of folk who simply won‚Äôt make good college students, but perhaps could find success in manual labor or skilled trades.  Those who are blessed by a lucky tumble of their genes should not look down upon anybody who works for a living.  Mike Rowe is right in that respect, and has done much to fight such stigma.

The small hat influencers simply accept the dysfunction for their tribe, it‚Äôs always a death spiral, crash and relocation for them over millennia.

        Practical matters aside, it‚Äôs also going to take willpower. Men and women holding their noses to be together. Everybody is damaged to a degree.

        If women could only admit this:One of the largest influences contributing to civilisational decline is the ascent of the gynocracy. Having worked in a mostly male world, you are correct that women by their nature are not risk takers. When shit breaks, they run on fear, striking out because they can‚Äôt control themselves nor the situation.Most male jobs that have stuff that breaks or experiences rapidly changing process that causes crisis/chaos have step by step protocols to follow to troubleshoot. As you work through the steps to troubleshoot, at any one of those steps you can find and solve the problem, the mind and emotions settle down to concentrate on resolution.  If a solution is not readily apparent after following steps of protocol, one of my guy mentors coached to make a cup of coffee and step outside, meaning clear your mind by switching into something mindless plus rotate the mind by stepping outside to empty your mind. That makes room for suddenly viewing the problem from another angle. Also, know when to rely on teamwork.  NONE of this protocol is part of wahmyn world. It‚Äôs all about feelings. Wahmyn world doesn‚Äôt do teamwork well, too competitive, nor ask for help.I learned all this working treatment and distribution in the water industry. I am so grateful for this perspective. Learned in water treatment I ran large anxiety dealing with crises in treatment plants because the water was in and out quickly and demanded a rapid problem solving.  I faced the fact that guys and a few women were better equipped than me to handle the rapid trouble shooting needed for water treatment. Very stressful when, during a rain/flood event, the influent raw water coming in was mud‚Ä¶literal mud‚Ä¶and all you could do was open up wide the alum and coagulents waiting until the ntu‚Äôs started to turn down, while I sweat bullets.  I trained and switched to water distribution because most problems in distribution gives one time to think through what is needed, time to assess, work with your on-shift partner when not solo, recognize and follow the protocol from main breaks to stealing of copper to losing SCADA system instrumentation. A much happier and less stressed Range found water distribution right for me with the stress level I could live with and time to trouble-shoot.You‚Äôre seeing wahmyn politicians running massive fear, puffed up with arrogance so they feel exempt of developing protocols nor following them, and not good at teamwork. They have never learned to think under pressure nor the art of the deal. To cover their fear, they move into endgame action and make totalitarian decisions, threatening to bring in police/military if her directives are not followed. This Is Panic Untrained. I knew this about my mind 30 years ago when I observed it‚Äôs a damned good thing I‚Äôm not a general because decision making under fire is not my forte. I surely want Z to be right‚Ä¶.that the end of the gynocracy is visible.

                I once had a business acquisition where I came up against a lady lawyer who started out all tough.It was sad to have to go through a trajectory familiar to me that resulted in her in tears, and losing a basic negotiation for her client. The big buttons, pushed. Like taking candy from a baby, wah-wah.Another situation involving a lady lawyer. A friend of mine was getting divorce raped by his 2nd wife, a bitch I could not stand the sight of. He thought it was a good idea to hire a lady lawyer, dumb ass was in his cups at the time. Dark liquor.So I ask him, ‚Äúhave you signed a decree yet?‚Äù He was giving away TONS of cash to this bitch. He tells me, ‚Äúno‚Äù. His lady lawyer worked out this deal, he gives up tons of cash, keeps equity in a house (right before 2008 crash no less‚Ä¶)I tell him party over. Forget the deal, I play Cyrano, re-negotiate the cash to half for the bitch ‚Äì no children involved and she re-married shortly after. Then get about shaking down the lady lawyer and cut her fee down by 2/3, another weak crunt. She was ‚Äúvery angry with him‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwe had a deal‚Ä¶‚ÄùFucking joke.We still enjoy discussing how I helped save his ass. When the house became worth a lot less, he bought ex wife out at the distressed value.

            Oh man I can relate to this. I‚Äôm the new guy to an all male team building software driven systems for a very well known company, but we have the exception of one female in a position of authority over the team. When shit breaks, she tends to become erratic while part of my job is to bring order and process to the team. It‚Äôs frustrating because she gets in the way.At first I thought the guys would resent me coming in and setting rules, but as time goes on I think they are relieved to finally have some discipline brought to the table.It just reminds me that the male way is based on order and reason.

        The problem is not just that women are poor managers, it is also that there are few, exclusively male spaces left, nowhere for boys to be boys. Boys don‚Äôt become pussies because they‚Äôre around women, they become pussies because they‚Äôre never in an all-male environment.A few years ago, Australia had something called Mansheds or something, a club were men rented a workshop for the specific purpose of having a space free from oestrogenated folks, where they could put pinups on the wall, tell dirty jokes and smoke cigars indoors.And unless you‚Äôre new to the Dark Side, you have already guessed what happens next: women start complaining about muh patriarchy, because why should only men be allowed to have an all-male workshop?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJRnZ6KBNEo

            Exactly, Felix.  Morgoth had a good guest stint on one of the TRS pods last year (TASOB, I‚Äôm pretty sure) where he talked about the loss of men‚Äôs club culture in Britain in this vein.
John Taylor Gatto‚Äôs ‚ÄúWeapons of Mass Instruction‚Äù fingers the phenomenon of ‚Äúadolescence‚Äù for this as well.  Young men used to smoothly transition between childhood to adulthood as they entered the double-digit years, increasingly socializing with and working with men.  They weren‚Äôt warehoused for 10+ hours a day with other squirrelly snarky teen co-eds while their hormones, both fight and the other f, raged unchecked.

            This is a process that needs to start much much younger. Boys and girls should attend separate schools after the 5th or 6th Grades.  This was still common practice 2 generations ago.  Men‚Äôs clubs grew out of this habit. If you develop good habits in youth you will carry those habits with you into adulthood.

                Single sex schools are a good idea because the focus is on academics, not socializing. Interestingly enough, girls are more likely to take classes that are ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù and boys classes that are ‚Äúfeminine.‚Äù  A girl won‚Äôt play dumb in class because she doesn‚Äôt want to appear to be too smart to a fellow she‚Äôs interested in (girls did that in the past, I don‚Äôt about now).

                    I think the ‚Äúgirls playing dumb‚Äù trope is BS. I don‚Äôt think it really happens, to any significant extent. After 30 years of homeschooling, we let the youngest go to a public school starting two years ago. She was shocked by how female-dominated it was, and about how biased against the boys the teachers were. The teachers would come down on the boys for behavior that was let slide with the girls. If it‚Äôs obvious enough that my not-very-political daughter who was 12-13 at the time noticed it, it is very bad.There are only a few male teachers and the kids are excited to be in their classes, because they‚Äôre not emotionally unstable harpies like so many of the female teachers.The entire disciplinary setup is designed to crack down on boy behavior (physical rough-housing) and reward female bad behavior (rumor-mongering, verbal harassment).The disciplinary measures are useless: lunch detention, in-school suspension, full suspension and expulsion. That‚Äôs about the extent. Of course, the kids who are really problems don‚Äôt regard any of those as punishment.My daughter got a couple lunch detentions and in-school suspensions, because it took her a while to work out the right social protocols: you don‚Äôt get in the face of some girl who has been spreading rumors about you and yell in her face. Lesson learned: spreading rumors is fine. Dealing with the problem in a straight-forward manner: bad. She also said she actually likes lunch detentions and in-school suspensions because they‚Äôre quiet and relaxed. Talk about a failed disciplinary strategy. Another thing about in-school suspensions: it‚Äôs where the trouble-making kids meet each other. This shakes out about as well as you‚Äôd expect.Our schools are run by idiots.

                        Viz, that‚Äôs required reading for both sides of the homeschooling debate.  Multiply these experiences by 12+ years, six months a year and it‚Äôs a wonder kids aren‚Äôt more jacked-up than they are today.  There‚Äôs a lot of ruin in a child but the system has all the toxins and all the time it needs to turn Our blue-eyed baby girls into ham-backed blue-haired skanks unless you bail that dirty water daily for a dozen years or so.
And what double-income household really has enough time for that?  Most importantly, why should you have to?

                The pre-woke Simpsons nailed the benefits of sex-based school separation in the classic ‚ÄúGirls Just Want to Have Sums.‚Äù
In the male math class, the male teacher shouted at the boys to stop horsing around (he didn‚Äôt put them on Adderall), and they promptly proceeded to working on geometry problems. In the female math class the female teacher put on some new age music and asked the girls ‚ÄúHow do the numbers make you feeeeelll? Is the number 7 odd, or just different?‚Äù

        If you recall in 2008-2011 they loved sing the term ‚Äúman-cession.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a recession, it‚Äôs a man-cession.‚Äù  This was commentary from the media hags.  In a way, there was a hidden     misandry to it because at no time did the commentary expand to what can be done about this.    The next recession, and it‚Äôll be a big one, will be the ‚Äúgyne-cession.‚Äô  All those little service and paper pushing jobs filled by women are going to feel it, including ‚Äúnon-profits.‚Äù ‚Äì entities where there is no profit after large salaries are paid.   Huge swaths of the economy, mostly that have direct aid from the government, such as our healthcare industry, have barely been touched by reality.  1) Education ‚Äì school districts and universities stuffed full of these women like cordwood. 2) corporate HR offices  3) Library systems  4) Hospital back office people  5) various Federal state and local agencies.  It goes on and on.  This is what‚Äôll be hit.

                Ha! Dutch, you nailed that one.  As a former water treatment op, water distribution op and hydro dam op, women constantly complained men got better pay‚Ä¶not fair. I replied train up to do my job, work shift work, get dirty and careful of the black widow spiders in valve pits plus an occasional rattle snake. No‚Ä¶.I‚Äôd leave out the bit about the spiders and the snakes.  Not a single woman within the water company nor from the outside transferred in for me to train them up. Only 2 lesbians‚Ä¶what‚Äôs up with that? Running a lot of guy energy I guess.  I am so sick of wahmyn bitching, and they never put their money where their mouth is.PS:  Working as a treatment operator, I found a large gopher snake next to the headhouse door. I grabbed it by the back of his head and ran into the headhouse big smile on my face proudly holding up the snake to show my 2 guy operators. They turned white and ran out the building. Sigh‚Ä¶I‚Äôm still a little country girl and totally forgot most guys didn‚Äôt grow up with garter snakes, gopher snakes and other critters to pick up and carry around. The trick is to lightning speed grab them from behind before they wallop you.  Sad Range‚Ä¶I felt like a cat bringing in her prey to give to the master guys as a gift for their good training. And the guys freaked to the max. I thought guys being guys they‚Äôd at least from the science point of view wish to look at the fine snakey specimen. That‚Äôs when I knew guys weren‚Äôt guys anymore.

        Gynocracy will collapse when the culture that allowed it to emerge collapses. It can‚Äôt be defeated from the outside* because any external opposition is immediately identified as ‚Äúsexism‚Äù and ‚Äúmisogyny‚Äù, isolated, and neutered or destroyed.

        It‚Äôs been a bit of an awakening for us now we are homeschooling our kids, and examining traditional roles and education.
My sense is that the gynocracy is weakening with each successive generation.  Of course it reached its zenith with the Boomers.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of wreckage in Gen X and early Millenials.  My hope is that late-stage Millenials and Gen Z survey the ruined landscape and reject the the failed ideology.

            Three percent of children are homeschooled now.  The deterioration of our social institutions is going to make that climb, and the established powers are going to start trying to clamp down.
Luckily for us, there are radical homeschool advocates at both sides of the political spectrum.  When push comes to shove. even most progressives will defend their children against the zeitgeist.
The others will pretend to be fine as their sons are getting their dicks chopped off.

            Generally speaking, we late Millennials are more skeptical of powerbitchery than our predecessors. Many of us grew up in the golden age of ‚Äúgame.‚Äù Indeed, so many of my peers were pussified that I frequently punched well above my weight. Nothing like punching an overweight woman.

        At one time, a man had a vested interest in marrying:  If he wanted a steady supply of safe and licit sex, to openly live with a woman and have children.  The better he did financially meant that he had access to a larger a pool of women to draw from.  Companies preferred to hire married men because they were viewed as more reliable and harder working.That‚Äôs not true anymore.  Sex is easily available, shacking up acceptable and unwanted offspring can either be aborted or dumped on the taxpayer.  Contrary to what Zman thinks, plenty of men are perfectly happy to live off of women and plenty of them are White.  There isn‚Äôt the stigma against being a slacker that there once was.

        So a couple of months ago I‚Äôm in a local sports bar waiting for a friend when in comes Ms Buzzcut McFeminist.  I made the mistake of nodding and saying ‚ÄúHi‚Äù when she immediately went into a well rehearsed and well worn rant about what pronouns she would answer to.

        A golf buddy of mine used to take me to his private golf club.  Exclusive.  Been around over a hundred years.  Members answered to no one. They had a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs grill room‚Äù. Women weren‚Äôt allowed.  They had their own room.  About 8 years ago they caved to pressure and allowed women, i.e. the wives.  Most of the women were traditional and didn‚Äôt hang there.  They didn‚Äôt over-run the room.  Didn‚Äôt make it their hen-house.  But it changed by their very presence.   I‚Äôll never forget the image and sound of a woman rummaging through her purse at one of the tables.  Her party had left and she was standing up with her purse on the table looking for something in it.  A hideous sight in the darkly lit, heavy wood grill room.  Just‚Ä¶depressing.

        To early to tell Z the fat lady hasn‚Äôt sung yet.The system still favors the females to a crazy degree..White men are at the bottom in terms of social political clout.A white man can‚Äôt look croz-eyed at a female without getting his ass fired.White men are still fragmented and so far unable to resist the system.  Some have went nuts and go MGTOW and bang rubber dolls.  Others collect guns and ammo the same way box wine women collect cats.  Others simply die inside and wonder WTF happened.Until white men find a way to organize themselves they will remain everyone s favorite punching bag.

        I live in Canada where we are even more pozzed‚Ä¶ and I am livin the gyno dream.I respected the women I worked with but wouldn‚Äôt take any shite off them. If they started getting hysterical they could either settle down and be serious ‚Äì or I‚Äôd throw their antics at the boss to deal with. And I told them flat out that I didn‚Äôt care how far up that totem pole I had to go; eventually I‚Äôd come across a man that actually gives a crap about the company, and wouldn‚Äôt take kindly to histrionics and drama. I dropped a couple of them in the crapper that way and after they got spanked, they left me alone. If they didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd just quit.Right now I am living on savings while my wife works, and I don‚Äôt feel a stitch of guilt, inadequacy or remorse. I‚Äôve got more time to shoot, camp and fish, I have a couple other hobbies I‚Äôve neglected for years, and I am not going to be guilt tripped into despair or booze because of a cratered job market. Many of us guys have let women lead us into other traps like materialism and consumerism. Booze? Drugs? Video games??? Buddy‚Ä¶ are you fuggin stoopid? You need a campfire and a cigar. A good hand full of cards. You don‚Äôt need a Lincoln, you need maybe a bike, a good set of boots, maybe a good dog. Who has time for despair?And Gab? I LOVE it. There‚Äôs a lot of trash there but you can ignore the loons or laugh at them. Stop feeling sorry for yourselves, never mind the harpies and hags. Guys‚Ä¶ most of our problems with women are self inflicted. When it comes to women, if you‚Äôre having problems, save your sanity and walk away. It‚Äôs hard, but sometimes it‚Äôs the only option.

        First, let me blow my own horn. Since the brothels and the bars are closed for the duration, my cash flow has freed up. Since I enjoy reading his posts, and amazingly haven‚Äôt been banned from posting (‚Äúyet‚Äù), I‚Äôve started a monthly contribution that will pay, at the least, for the electricity the night light in Z‚Äôs hallway bath uses üòÄGood topic today. Very pertinent is Murray‚Äôs book ‚ÄúComing Apart.‚Äù In this one, the co-author of the infamous Bell Curve basically looks at white trash and whites in general and develops Bell Curve‚Äôs theme of the Cognitive Elite, a stratifying of society based at least in part on intelligence. If Murray‚Äôs thesis is correct, society has gotten much more polarized not only by money but by intelligence/skills: two generations ago, the rich lived in the same small town, perhaps a better neighborhood tho, than the men (it was men back then) that worked in his nearby office or factory. Less dramatically, the bright, not to say genius, man became highly successful as an accountant or machinist. In today‚Äôs world, those two would more likely be recruited early for their brains, offered scholarships etc. and end up respectively as a wealthy capitalist who distances himself both physically and socially from his economic inferiors, in a way that his grandfather could not have imagined. The small, smart guy most likely ends up over-educated and under-utilized, say as a public school teacher trying to educate primates or a lawyer or accountant doing drudge work soon to be automated.

            Murray‚Äôs book are always worth reading but in every one of them he won‚Äôt go down an obvious path that would explain so much more. In the one you‚Äôve cited he never addresses how the smart set have their loyalties and concerns for their blood and history  killed off and then realigned with a new community of walled off object collectors. That distancing still serves a community tied by blood and history. One they can serve but never truly be a part of. The smart set doesn‚Äôt look too far down the road. That has consequences. Just ask the old WASP elite.

        The strength of the bond of sisterhood has impressed me.  Feminists and their sympathizers form a group as tightly cohesive as blacks or jews.  I would have expected their ability to birth life would cause them to bond with their children or their men more strongly than other women, but that is wrong.
The media/academy has a huge role in influencing their choice of feminism over family. They may have chosen differently if our enemies weren‚Äôt in control.
We must make an offer more appealing than their own job and money, single parenthood, and abortion.

            Line‚Ä¶.believe that women herding is hardwired. My opinion theory is:In northern Europe 15 K years ago, men hunted big meat animals for women like me to eat. Women hung together helping and teaching how to raise kids, watching the wee bairns, teaching medicine-how to sew skins into clothes, how to cook, and thousands of bits of survival info. Because men were often gutted and killed by the hunted, there were frequent times in history there were more women than men, and if a man was a good provider, he had more then one woman.  Sister Wife #1 lets Og know if he‚Äôs going to bring in Hottie #2, #1 wife gets to be dominant to #2 and run the household. Huge competition between women. This competitive nature of women is hardwired along with women herding, and continues to this day. The admix of women herding and competition creates a continual tension.

                    pss, update: Exile‚Äôs addition on the shattering effects of industrial modernity is also spot on.As a male raised by a ‚Äúwidowed‚Äù mom- no fault of Mom or Dads- I can attest to the earlier comments.I know nothing of sports, mechanics, or skills.I wanted to ‚Äòget into‚Äô construction, but had no idea how.  Didn‚Äôt join the military, and worked mostly around hundreds of women.  Even so, I was clueless til Heartiste, PBUH.I always ask the young guys where they learned their skillz.  They had dads and uncles and just seemed to soak it up.(I remain entry level and solo, and never learned to climb the ladder, to take advantage of the system‚Äôs offers.  I hunt a different something, an unknown trail.)Low caste mechanics turned youtube into a revolutionary how-2 library.  We need, need, need to use that hidden strength.Teaching men of any age to be useful men, relying on the ancient instincts of the hunting band, should be our top priority.  It‚Äôs something we can do now, right now.The rest will follow.

        The positions women play on the team of life are constantly changing. Most men prefer ladies. We are drowning in a sea of chicks. A rose by any other name begins with a C.

            I thought of that a few years ago when I got Netflix. Naturally, practically every show was pozzed and trying to destroy traditional white culture. At first, I was upset, but then I laughed at myself for being so stupid. No shi$ these shows are awful. They‚Äôre made by people who hate me. They don‚Äôt hide that. It‚Äôd be the same if they were watching a show that I produced. Yet, I‚Äôm sending them money every month and giving them my eye balls.
I told myself to grow a pair.

        Here‚Äôs new metric that you might find useful in conversation, inspired by the commenter who said that the supermarket checkers were surprised to hear that the flu actually kills people.This will be the ratio of worldwide WuFlu deaths to average annual influenza mortality. I‚Äôll keep it to two significant places, as a percentage.Source one:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815659/‚ÄúWe estimate an average of 389 K (uncertainty range 294 ‚Äì 518 K) respiratory deaths were associated with influenza globally each year during the study period, corresponding to ~ 2% of all annual respiratory deaths.‚Äù (The study period was 2002-2011.)Source two will be the current total on the Johns Hopkins site.Today‚Äôs ratio: 0.21The raging pandemic that has terrified the world and demolished the relationship between people and their governments has killed one-fifth as many people as the flu kills in an average year.Might be fun to ask people how high they think it will go. Force them to think about ratios. Ratios require denominators, and those of you who follow the news will realize that they don‚Äôt do denominators.(Reminds me of when fourteen retired flag officers (admirals and generals) criticized the Iraq invasion. Fourteen. You read that all the time. Fourteen! There were 7000 retired flag officers alive at the time, but two out of every thousand isn‚Äôt very impressive.)

        This isn‚Äôt a pandemic. It is a damn panic, kind of like a woman seeing a mouse or a spider.
I smelled out the sham of feminism early on. Way too many women got the house, the kids, and alimony so they could trade up. And women who didn‚Äôt have kids were bitter and desperate as their biological clock ticked away. Women got new rights but no new obligations, like being combat recruits.
Now there are all these silly movies with a woman beating up a platoon of special ops guys. Yeah, right.

It is my hope that this lack of progress will fall down on local school districts like a ton of bricks for the failure. We can only hope that there is an engagement and uproar over the matter.

        I‚Äôd go back farther than what you say, Zman.What I have observed is in families where divorce occurred in the 1920s, 30s and 40s, entire family tree branches died out. Children growing up in divorced homes of that era were seriously scarred (even if they did marry) and were not able to produce sons and daughters who could successfully mate, let alone have children. This first generation of despair from divorce was the subject of much literature of the era. By the time Peyton Place rolled around, it was already a second generation affliction.It wouldn‚Äôt be too much of a stretch to say gynocracy was on the ascendant since the Seneca Falls conference. 1848. We seem to hysterically vacillate between Temperance and degeneracy.

COVID is a global Jonestown.Then as now Women are the Chief Lieutenants of mass suicides.Quite true; Jones‚Äôs chief subordinates and the ones who mixed the Kool Aide were women.

        Our society is built to use the education system to select for advancement/favor/success. The female-dominated education system selects a certain type of male, in short, soy boy bugmen, the kind of males that struggle with women. (Some real men fake their way through the system, and some succeed outside the system, but many get pushed down and spit out.) The result has been a generation or three in which many real men have been deemed surplus to requirements.This can be seen in politics. Politics selects for creepy men. Joe Biden, Bill Clinton and Bob Packwood, etc., are examples from the older generation, in short, perverts who grope women and would put their pecker in any woman that would let them and some who wouldn‚Äôt. There are few, if any, such creeps in the new generation of politicians, and the ones that there exist are probably sodomites, i.e., ruined even worse than your average soy boy bugman.All of this is by the design of our ruling class. The dropping white birth rates is a feature not a bug.

        ‚ÄúThat may be the light at the end of the tunnel. Increasingly, women are seeing the disaster that is modern life for what it is. The slow flowering of traditional women living life as traditional wives and mothers is a little green shoot.‚ÄùNo, I don‚Äôt think so.  All those middle-aged and older spinsters are quite happy with the choices they made, contrary to popular belief from the manosphere that we‚Äôd like to believe.  And so, we are on to the third generation of this nonsense.On the other hand, since they are deciding to commit to extinction by not breeding, the generations of the future will be much more likely to be raised by patriarchal groups, with not a whole of lot feminists left to recruit them.  Problem is that‚Äôs gonna take quite a while before we see any positive results.

        If The Great Panic of 2020 does in fact end up as the clear and identifiable end of the gynocracy, this will be the ultimate delicious irony.  To explain the reason I will see great irony in this, I need to first explain my suspicions regarding the bad cold going around that (somehow??) provoked The Great Panic of 2020.  I know you‚Äôre all as sick of this as I am, so I‚Äôll be as brief as possible, and then move to the irony itself.Back in September 2019, the Everything Bubble, the ultimate grand expression of our God-Complex class, started popping.  While the central banks applied the band-aid of ‚Äúrepo madness,‚Äù all concerned knew this was a band-aid, could only bide a little time, and that there was no stopping the Everything Bubble from popping and coming down.  This of course immediately created the situation ‚Äî as their very first priority ‚Äî of a need for a suitable scapegoat.  Then, whether planned or merely fortuitous, only a month or so later, a bad cold broke out in Wuhan, China ‚Ä¶ or ‚Ä¶ somewhere.  Whether the CCP created and released it (accidentally or on purpose), whether Bill Gates was tasked with this by the God-Complex class, or whether it really did spontaneously mutate from a bat coronavirus and started infecting humans ‚Ä¶ or somehow‚Ä¶ does not matter.  Something appeared.The members of the God-Complex class, each having a God-complex (no, this fine trait did not go away with Caligula Caesar and his ilk), believe they can do anything, including deflecting all blame for their crimes against humanity (at or away from Epstein Island) on to a cold bug.  So at some point they chose the bad cold going around this cold and flu season as the scapegoat.  Enter, stage left, the modern harpies.  With their unhinged impulse for ‚Äúabsolute safety‚Äù taken to unrestricted and crazed proportions, the God-Complex class got more than it ever could have dreamed of at the start.  The focus on the bad cold going around ‚Äî to the absolute exclusion of anything else ‚Äî is unprecedented, at least in my experience.  I‚Äôve never seen such an extreme of monomania before, not even 911, not anything.  The God-Complex class cannot have people focused on their fraud, scams, and bubble-blowing over decades leading up to the inevitable economic collapse and severe conditions, which were going to happen in any event.  This in turn might lead to mobs with torches and pitchforks descending on places such as the Hamptons and the like, and we can‚Äôt have that!!!  Amazing as it is, all economic problems, however bad this ends up getting, will all be blamed on a bad cold.  At least in the spirit of giving the Devil his due, I do have to give the Epstein Islanders their due for pulling this one off.The great irony is present from the fact that it is the gynocracy harpies who have so facilitated, at the ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù level, the God-Complex class‚Äô success at pulling this off; they‚Äôve facilitated the Devil in actually getting his due.  And yet if the same Great Panic of 2020 provokes the end of the gynocracy, then that which the gynocracy harpies so facilitated and made happen is that which will also start the end of their own oh so precious gynocracy itself!  I love it!  These harpies always have been the ultimate political useful idiots.  They‚Äôve demonstrated this many times over throughout the past decades ‚Äî always pushing for things they then find are to their own detriment, and from there further blaming the ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù and pushing for more things ‚Ä¶ ultimately to their own detriment.  Wash, rinse, repeat.I at least hope this is the beginning of the end of the gynocracy; I should point out I am not yet entirely convinced that it is.  Things do though look promising.  The screeching feminists have sure gone quiet, especially the most shrill and coo-coo of the screechers.  However, regarding the (hoped for) reemergence of traditional women, I remain quite skeptical.  The reason is too many who put up this front, really like chameleons, are already circa 30 ‚Äì 35 years old.  What have they been doing the past 10 to 15 years?  Actually, do I even want to know?  Probably not.  What I see here are harpies who see themselves approaching, at warp speed, their futures of herding cats and drinking box wine, and so as a desperation measure are pretending to be what they are not, so they can rope in a man, later divorce him, and collect the loot.  That said, if there are 20 year old women out there who are traditional (and walking the walk; not just talking the talk), then this would be much more believable to me and instill some hope.

                    I was with Spencer at AmRen years back. We were chatting with some other people and suddenly Spencer saw the NBC people setting up a camera for a live shot. He was transfixed. He could not take his eyes off the thing. Eventually, he left and made his way to the camera for a live shot.
I thought about the first time I met John Kerry. Same thing. Spencer is a classic example of the narcotic of minor celebrity. I bet he still wakes up every afternoon and googles his name, to see if anyone has mentioned him.

            When I first started reading Z a few years ago, when various Alt-Right personalities were rising, he‚Äôd come down on a few guys that I liked.  It made me mad when he‚Äôd disparage them.  After all, it was high-tension times back then and they were more-or-less on our side. I assumed part of his criticism stemmed from alpha aggression and fame-envy.  Some of the guys were Milo, Gavin McGinnes, and Richard Spencer.   Time has shown him to have taken their measure accurately.  As per a recent podcast, Z still holds some reservations about Nick Fuentes.  I like Nick.  The old me would be pissed at Z about it.  But again, he‚Äôs shown to have good instincts on this stuff.

If you don‚Äôt then you deserve what you get.   skinny jeans are for fags, not for men.   read this by Henry Rollins for a sense of what you are missing:https://www.oldtimestrongman.com/articles/the-iron-by-henry-rollins/Here‚Äôs a taste:  The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you‚Äôre a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.

            I saw Henry open for Jane‚Äôs Addiction in early 90‚Äôs.  Didn‚Äôt know who he was at the time.  Guy was funny though.  He only wore black shorts (no shoes even) and would strike an aggressive pose and just stare provokingly at the crowd. It was dorky yet somehow not.  Kinda like Henry himself.   Here‚Äôs a short video celebrating the heartfelt connection between artist and fans.

            I love Rollins Band‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiar‚Äù. This is certainly a common male way to handle women, but not necessarily one we‚Äôve been discussing here üòÄ

            No better way to get in touch with your inner male.  If you have no money or skills, you can always work on yourself.
