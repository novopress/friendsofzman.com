        Having served on a jury trial in NYC in the early 2000s for a medical malpractice case I can attest to the danger Mr Penny is in. To say the jury pool is drawn from the lowest dregs of NYC is an understatement. As Sebastian Mansicalco once said in his bit about jury duty “most of the potential jurors are one step away from being a defendant”.We spent 3 weeks on the jury and the judge restricted us from taking notes even though the medical testimony on both sides was ridiculously complicated. Comes the time to deliberate a verdict only two of us (the only whites) bothered to pay any attention to the trial while the other ten jurors (undefined mystery meat) had no clue what had transpired over the past 3 weeks. Me and the retired white school teacher spent the next 3 hours explaining the basic issues of the case like we were talking to 5yo retards.

            It is not just the juries. Judges are often bizarrely stupid. Jumanji Jackson worked her way up to the Supreme Court and she may not be able to read.

                50-50 on Jumanji being able to read.  We do know that she can’t give a definition of a woman.  What’s just as bad is everyone in the room who sat in silence and then voted her in instead of ridicule and laughter and demanding someone serious and competent.

                    Sotomayor compared restricting the distribution of hormone blockers to restricting the use of aspirin.  There is a strong case she is even dumber.  I am surprised she isn’t still wearing a mask to protect herself from Covid like Taylor Lorenz.

                                Or perhaps Kagan feels encouraged by the strength that her side is demonstrating in having two dumb supreme court justices who share her goals.
As I often repeat, to Z Man as well with his final sentence of this post, the battle is not between the capable and the incompetent or the producers versus the takers. It is traditional whites versus everyone else.
Some of the smartest and most capable people on the planet hate traditional whites. These people do not want to live and let with you in state of high productivity.

                                    You get it – too many of Zman’s newer cuckservatard readers do not. I read (I think at Gayway Pundit) that Israeli-born dyke Dafna Yoran has referred to Penny, throughout the trial, as “the White man.”  When they tell you they hate you, believe them.

Well put, good insight.  To say it’s the stupid vs the smart, or any of your other stated comparisons does not aptly describe the situation.  Whites are not simply the bearers of a higher than average IQ and therefore education from the rest of the population—they are also imbued with various behavioral proclivities which make them better suited to deliberate in a court of law according to our heritage Anglo-Saxon, Christian tradition.

Don’t think that’s quite what @Zman said, but it may well have been what he meant.
Hope you are not right, though. Non-white excludes about 40%, non-trad excludes about half the remainder. That’s still enough, but if you then throw out the derided grillers and sportsballers and cucks, we lose. They could take us just sending in their waterboys.

                    And the fix was in for her to be confirmed.  Any sensible inquisitor would have asked her if she herself were a woman.  If she said yes, the follow up would be how do you know?. No body ever seems to ask simple biological questions such as, do you have ovaries, no, born with a vagina, no, you are not a woman, do you have a prostate, yes, guess what you are a man. Easy stuff.

                The dumbest of the lot by far is the Wise Latina Sonia Sotomayor. During oral arguments other justices frequently have to explain to her in a roundabout way what is being claimed in the moment. She has no grasp of simple and basic legal concepts. Jackson also is retarded, but she seems to grasp the argument from time to time.
There are numerous such judges at the trial level, and that is where the severest damage is done.

                    Yes ! The confirmation of the obviously unqualified Sotamayor to the SC was a watershed moment that I dreaded for years. Once the DEI agenda penetrated the supreme court and competence was sacrificed in favor of diversity it set a terribly dangerous precedent. It won’t be much longer before South African levels of corruption and malfeasance are SOP in every court, state and federal, in Amerika.

My husband was reading the other day about the first heart transplant done in South Africa in 1967 (rememberreading about it back then).  And today the Whites who remain in that forsaken land have no reliable power or potable water, and are routinely slaughtered by friends of employees of ‘security companies’ they hire.  And we can no longer build . . . just about anything (airplanes, bridges, etc.).

                    I believe you can thank Bush The Elder for her. She began her legal career in Morgenthau’s office in Manhattan and at some point her name was put in front of Bush and he had her put on the federal bench in an attempt to show the left he wasn’t racist.I remember when barry put her up for consideration to SCOTUS and the SC struck down one of her signature rulings right in the middle of her confirmation hearings. Her decision to dismiss an appeal from (I believe) the city of Hartford firefighters union (Whites, as usual, were deliberately passed over for promotion and they sued the city of Hartford) was struck down by I believe a 7-2 vote. Not only did the SC find for the White fire fighters, saying the city deliberately screwed them and that they were to be awarded the promotions with back pay, they publicly called her out over her not even reading the appeal and dismissing it out of hand. The court also made a point of calling her out over her statement, “The plaintiffs are white men, they can’t complain about being discriminated against.” as unbecoming of a federal judge. Cal Thomas was interviewing Dershowitz the day the decision was handed down. Thomas called her bigoted and Dershowitz agreed, saying, “Obama should withdraw her name from consideration immediately. Her reason for dismissing the appeal demonstrates a complete disregard for basic legal practice, not to mention the blatantly bigoted comment.”And yet, there she sits.

                I can attest to this – most of the judges in our area were HBCU grads who can barely read.  Actors in lawyer/cop shows know more real law than these idiots. To top it off, many of them were female with all the baggage included.

                The intellectual and lawyering savaging that Ted Cruz gave her in the Senate was shocking. She was rendered incapable. Unfortunately, in this age, it was just a vanity based cock strut by Ted Cruz. What the Ted Cruz’s of the world need to realize, and realize quickly, is that this cock strutting gets them nothing. In fact, it builds up enemies who seethe in resentment and desire for absolute destruction as revenge.The savaging did nothing to prevent her from being confirmed as a SC Justice. Someday she may be the chief justice and exact her revenge on us all.It is time to act. By that I don’t mean the Eye-patch Dan and Ocasio-Cortez and O’Connell … … pantomimes and cheap theatrics. I mean serious action that neutralizes our destruction and promotes our victory.

                    Already are outnumbered; both literally and effectively. Get over it. You ain’t saving the white race by caring for all of them (Americans calling themselves “Europeans” are traitors). Sympathize, sure, but look out for your own – go local, family, neighbors, nearby communities. More than that a person spreads their effective concern too thin and renders themself impotent.

                        Enough with this defeatism, men! In South Africa, a handful of whites literally ruled hordes of illiterate, stupid blacks for generations. Things are getting so bad there and in other black African utopias that they are begging whites to return because that’s the only way to keep the lights on and the water flowing.
The only reason things are this bad is because WE let it slide.

Perhaps after the worst of the stupids die out due to technological colapses a new white race will re-evolve in the cold regions.  Hopefully one with stronger in-group preference.

            I could say the same thing about charity, you give and give and it’s never enough.Even when Zelenskyy has all the lettuce in the world it still won’t be enough unless you also die. The sullen dark faces with outstretched hand, while in the other, a machete. At this point I donate to nothing (Thanks to the Salvation Army informing me I need to confess my guilt about being white) and I sit on my hands. Do not produce, protest or participate.

                    Those kettles are a scam.  I knew a couple who was involved in this activity and they kept almost all the money and it was perfectly legal. This was in the late 80s very early 90s. They made thousands of extra Dollars during the Christmas season.  Almost all charities are scams including the Salvation Army and have been for a long, long time.Jack London wrote a book called People of the Abyss in 1903.  In one of the chapters, the Salvation Army is the focus.  They were pretty brutal to the homeless people they were “serving” in London.  Just the fact they are or were an international charity is a giant strike against them, IMHO.

                With some minor exceptions of local charities, I would not give money to any charity under any circumstances.  Most charities are just flat out scams.  Even the ones that aren’t almost never do their “work” where you can observe what they do, how they do it and most importantly, the effect of their charitable works in whatever ‘community’ they “serve”

                    Can’t say I agree with you about the Salvation Army. They only use 18% of the money they collect on administrative expenses, which is pretty good. They don’t have obscene salaries, either. The remaining 82% they spend on their programs and they do pretty good things with down and out people, druggies and drunks are what they are known for.The good stuff I throw out always goes to them, even though I have to drive all the way to downtown to donate it just because I happen to like that charity. It is also Christian based which I also like.The Catholic charity down the street gets my second and third tier stuff. I figure profits they make go to pay off kiddie diddling lawsuits. I have no idea what percentage administrative costs are for them and I don’t care either. It’s a place to dump my stuff off.Otherwise, I do agree with you about charities.

                        If I was going to give to a charity, I too would carefully chose a Christian charity which does local work.I have a bad taste in my mouth about the Salvation Army because of the kettles in the malls and outside of stores.  Back in the late 80s, my best friend from high school and his wife both worked for a company that did those kettle collections. It wasn’t Salvation Army they worked for, but a contractor.  They kept like 90% of what when into the buckets and it was perfectly legal.  So based on my own personal experience, the SA may spend the vast majority of what they get on charitable work, they’re not getting the vast majority of what is thrown into the buckets.  Though I know that is not the only way they collect funds.Jack London wrote a book called People of the Abyss about the horrific conditions in London, England in 1903.  One of the chapters mentioned the Salvation Army specifically. I forget all the details as I read this book well over a decade ago, but I remember they locked them in the church for a service in order to qualify for unleavened rock hard bread and some salt.The book was actually quite good. He was doing undercover investigative journalism.  He was posing as one of the down and out Londoners.  The neighborhoods were all “filled up” and subletting was the norm. Entire families living in a single room of a London row home with coin operated stoves.  Of course, clothes would be hung to dry in the room they had, that they slept in. In some cases, beds were rented by the shift.  When the day shift got up in the morning, the night shift guy got into the bed.  He went to the workhouses where he was forced to clean up radioactive medical waste and to break rocks and then bathed in the same water as nearly 100 other men.  The book is just one horror show after another.

                        I used to donate to the SA.  I also thought they were fairly good “in a sea of grifters”.  However, there was that VP in the organization who posted on their web page some BS about atonement of ‘Whites for their past sins against coloreds’, or some such.  That was it, no more.  Yeah, the main organization attempted to backtrack for this “slight”, but really they only regretted the financial loss—not the message.As to local charities, there was one in town.  A rescue mission where bums could catch a meal, watch some TV, and sleep on a cot in a large communal room.  I brought my son there with donations and to take a look around the place at an early age.  It was as bare bones and basic as you could have.  They also were imbued with a Christian message for the men taken in.  The organizer was a minister, and this was his ministry.  Hell, the yard was filled with shopping carts from these men.  No drugs allowed, nor intoxicated individuals admitted.  I’d send money on a regular quarterly basis.  Never had a regret and the amounts were substantial.Then one day, the minister retired and a new director installed.  She seemed fine and was heard on the radio a lot.  The organization got involved with several other local charities and moved into a large complex where all these charities could get together to serve in a more “efficient manner”.  There was specialization of a sort and the influx grew.  Then one Thanksgiving, they advertised that they were going to have their annual Thanksgiving dinner, but with a twist—they made it “drive through”!Yep, all were welcome to drive up and be handed “ready to go”, packaged turkey and fixings for the family.  No longer do we have the traditional “soup kitchen” with the least and lost gathered around in grateful prayer.  We (they) were now in the 21st century!  Get with it.Well, silly me, I thought if you could afford gas and a car and insurance, you were not one of the least and the lost.  I immediately stopped my donations.  🙁Now, if I feel the need, I hand out my funds directly.  Seems to have rubbed off on son at least.  Last time we’re were on vacation some bum hit us up for a hand out saying he was hungry.  Without batting an eye, son said he were hungry too and was just heading to the restaurant a couple doors over.  He invited him to sit with him and keep him company, and to order whatever he wanted—his treat.A half hour or so he rejoined me and we continued on our way.  🙂

I was a recipient of SA charity when I was a small child and whether they’ve slipped or not I may not put money in the kettle but I won’t attack them.   I like and respect the folks here who differ. I upvoted you but it adds to the downvotes, so you are not as downvoted as it appears

                            You may not be familiar, but there’s a certain segment of the population here that apparently hates me. I find it funny more than anything else. At one point I think I had 15 down votes on the first post. Who could hate the Salvation Army that much?
Whatever their deficiencies, they do good work. I have a soft spot for the sad sacks and lost puppies of the world and that’s who they are known for helping.

                There was a Salvation Army Christmas tree in the nearest Walmart right after Thanksgiving, in our 93% White county.  Almost all the names on the ‘gift’ tags were obvious non-Whites.  I stopped doing the Christmas ‘Santa” and toy drives years ago for the same reason.  I donated three “Thanksgiving” meals from the local grocery store to the local food pantry, and I handed some cash to my usual cashier at the smaller local market.  And we give monthly to the local church we attend.  Otherwise I remain unapologetically Scrooge.

            “White men must stop jumping in to help other people.”Yep. This is something you learn real quick when you start carrying a gun in public. That thing is on your hip to protect YOU and NOBODY else. No white-knighting, no playing hero, no “helping” the cops. No saving the women and children or the banker’s money, LOL.Everyone else had a choice to get their own carry permit. if they didn’t, they can reap the consequences of their decision. It’s not up to you to save them.There are plenty of cases of dudes who got into trouble trying to be a hero, I need not recite them all here. There was a CCW guy in Colorado who got shot by the cops after he stopped a mall shooter. Numerous examples. Just look at Zimmerman and Rittenhouse. Even if you beat the rap you might not beat the ride, the legal fees or the civil case.

                        Interesting. A generational difference in marks of suspicion.
As a stereotypical Gen X guy, if I didn’t know these characters already, I’d know Trump’s picks are mostly bad because most of them look “dressed up,” in the costume sense. Can’t trust a man who doesn’t look right in his suit, a woman in Fox News makeup, a midlife crisis tattoo guy, etc.
The divorced—still on the prowl when they’re too old to signify it naturally—often look that way.
Different clue, same suspect.

                        Divorce is a negative signet of character, absolutely.  With the proviso that 80% of divorces are initiated by women.
I am somewhat less than giddy about Donnie’s picks.  Not as bad as his first (clueless) term, but nothing earthshaking aside from, perhaps, DOGE.
He needs asskickers, not empowered women running the justice department.  America already has that and it’s not working for men and boys.

            100% this, especially now. It has only accelerated with time. You run afoul of a minority for ANY reason in a lefty bughive and you are well and truly f-cked because juries are FULL of virtue signaling white wahmen who would be more than happy to throw you under the bus as well as said aggrieved minorities.But as Z pointed out, that is only half your battle, the other half is the judge. You can be SURE the prosecutor in any leftist enclave will be looking for maximum damage to you if it’s a White vs. minority setup of -any- sort but the judges in those places are also a major factor and the sad reality is, your odds are slim.Most people here know my story, Daniel Penny’s current predicament was my lived experience but mercifully, on far less serious charges than his. But! All lefty prosecutors will take a single charge and “clone” it like they did with Trump using a single charge to magically create 37 felonies for him. This is standard operating procedure which is why the conviction rate in this clownish “just us” system is well north of 95% everywhere.You stand little chance at a jury trial of beating all the trumped up (pun intended) charges vs. just taking the plea and hoping for the best.Even in my case which was centered around aSINGLEtext message it was blown up into a battery of additional charges such that I was looking at up to10-15 yearsin the slam. Would I have gotten that, no, not likely, but that is the risk of going to trial. So you take the plea and deal with it. They squeezed 4 charges out of that one message.I “won the lottery” as my lawyer so aptly (and sadly) stated it because I happened to get one of the only non-political judges left in the DC sewer. They immediately saw this was a ridiculous frame up and so I got off relatively lightly. If you consider some small jail time, near bankruptcy, and the inability to earn income for 7+ years “light” for the “crime” of offending a minority via text message.This is the world we live in. That was 10 years ago now. Imagine how that would have gone down had that happened to me today? GET OUT of lefty areas. Period. Your life depends on it for a number of reasons.

        I was a plaintiff in a civil trial once and the experience totally sucked. It was clear that the jury did not want to be there at all. It was an insouciant jury, not an impartial jury.I lost. I am certain I would have won if I had requested a bench trial instead. Of course like most litigants I was following my lawyer’s advice and he wanted a jury trial because he thought (wrongly) they would award more money and thus he would get a bigger contingency fee.The experience forever redpilled me on what a three-ring, bullshit circus the entire system of courts, lawyers, judges and juries really is. I will never trust the courts ever again.

            The difference between having a talented lawyer and having a hack is night and day. Comfortable in a courtroom, equipped with a thorough knowledge of legal principles, the talented one stands a much better chance of winning your case.It reminds me of the movieThe Devil’s Advocate, where the Keanu Reeves character plays an unbeatable lawyer. In the film, it makes sense that the devil would want to recruit him to the legal capital of the universe, New York City, and make him his heir apparent.What the film gets wrong is that the lawyer would resist the side of evil. I’m not so sure of that. The unbeatable lawyer, seeing a chance to join an unbeatable team, would probably take it. After all, lawyers are renowned for being as opportunistic as sharks.I also doubt the Keanu character would be able to resist the devil’s logic. 😈 The devil, schooled in rhetoric from the bowels of hell and a trained litigator, would run circles around any earthly counterpart. Say what you want about hell, it’s Darwinian.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            As bad as most judges are, you are probably correct you would have been better off with a bench trial. Heck, binding arbitration probably would have been better.
In this day and age, the people who land on juries are double-digit IQ “Law and Order” viewers that are easily swayed by emotional rhetoric.

                    I was slated for empanelment on a drunk driving case.  The trial judge first lectured the potential jury pool, then he asked disqualifying questions of us—then the prosecutor, then the defendant’s lawyer.  The defendant was a Hispanic—who’d have thunk?The odd part about this was that the White judge bent over backwards to explain to the jury pool aspects of the case and charge quite beneficial to the defendant.  For example, that the law did *not* prohibit driving with alcohol in your system—only that you were impaired in driving ability by it.  The questions of the jury wrt impartiality were quite reasonable in my opinion.  In fact, I have been perfectly content if after the Judge questioned us, the remaining jurors were seated.  The questions then asked by the defendant’s lawyer were absurd and very off putting to me.  Of course, when ask about my education and employment I was excused.  😉

            That case is what we used to accuse the Soviets of doing. Five years waiting for trial. Meanwhile, all of their assets have been liquidated, making a defense impossible, even if they get to trial. I have no sympathy for porn actors, but this is third world justice.

                        Of course not, no engineer ever does when just starting out. 50 years ago or so, the Hoechst-Celanese plant in, um, maybe Bishop, TX, had an inoperable distillation tower set up outside the parking lot. It was a disaster, designed by a team of newbies with stellar credentials from MIT, CalTech, and I don’t remember where all else, and it never worked. Never could have worked, except on paper. It was set there as a cautionary tale to n00bs and experienced engineers alike.

        I thought it was insanely dangerous to interfere with diversity in new york city of all places but talking to the cops without a lawyer &amp; even demonstrating the chokehold he used to the detectives demonstrates a severe lack of awareness.Part of me envies the fact he was somehow unaware of the extreme anarcho tyranny of the city he resides in. I can only imagine how pleasant it must’ve been to be so blissfully ignorant to what the country has become. That had some severe consequences though &amp; even if by some miracle he gets off it was still a very costly mistake.This feels like a modern day rendition of the little red riding hood story &amp; unfortunately for Daniel I think its going to have a similarly unpleasant ending but I really do hope I’m wrong.

                True, its just that every vet I know is extremely right wing &amp; plugged into the conspiracy sphere if not full blown white nationalist. Goes against my typical experience but then again what do I know about people from new york. Every vet I’ve known is from the midwest or the south so in hindsight I was being a bit narrow minded being surprised by this. Still even within that framing its like my mind naturally wonders how the hell he didn’t notice this lol.

He “served” and he palled around with the cops. Twice a traitor.

                This is correct. If you are truly a dissedent you should view soldiers with the same level of affection you view DMV workers with, at least DMV workers usually haven’t killed anybody trying to defend their country from an invasion.
The stuff they said people said about returning vietnam vets was mostly bullshit but for israel’s current boys in uniform all that stuff would be deserved.

        Well we can sit around pissing and moaning about it all we like. The truth of the matter is that the system, as it currently stands – cannot survive. Nor is there anything guys like you and I can do about it except feed it or kill it. The beauty of it is we have a third option – to stand aside and let it kill itself.If I see some woman getting gang banged by a bunch of migrants and undocumented visitors… I will not lift one finger to help. Conservative, sensible women will no longer expose themselves to dangerous, stupid people in dangerous, stupid places. The chances are overwhelming that the victim is a moronic shitlib and getting exactly what she’s voting for. When women scream about troons chasing them around in the washroom and locker room… cry me a river, ladies. YOU voted for the faggotry and perversion, knowing the other loons would come prancing out of the closet too. The big blue shithole cities are dens of vipers and sinners that fear and hate heroes with the heat of 1000 suns. Heroes shine a light on them and they hate it.When I was a kid, they’d scurry off into the shadows when exposed. Today they bare their fangs at us, rear up – and dare us to go for it. And we (for now) go grumbling off an let it all slide. It’s time to stop fed poasting and grumbling.The other day some New York fart sucking CEO was gunned down in cold blood and I just smiled. When the system fails… this is the way. Reprisals must be dire, mean and heartless – basically the same way they deal with us.There is a quickening in the air. The tee off of festivities will begin in earnest when our financial house of cards collapses.

            Well said.  At this point the only women a man should be defending are his own.  Let them get what they’ve been asking for.  Same for the financial elite – they’ve been able to insulate themselves from the damage they cause for too long.
A friend recently told me that pro athletes are having their homes invaded during game time by these foreign gangs.  I smiled.

            I can appreciate hyperbole.  That said, when it comes down in real life to protecting women, children, the old and the weak you are a white man and presumably a Christian.

I trust if, God forbid, my daughters or nieces or any woman were being gang raped in your vicinity you would take action.  Again, I can appreciate hyperbole and trust you are not an actual monster

        Add a new wrinkle: doxing. In addition to having to deal with often hostile and ignorant minorities selected as jurors, outside of the courtroom Antifa and other leftwing terrorist organizations know who jurors are and where they live. The odds are pretty good the wannabe communists have put details about Penny’s jurors all over the ‘Net. The odds also are pretty good that the FBI did so if their Antifa allies failed to do so.Another perceived absolute right is a public and open proceeding. How can this provide a fair trial in the modern era? Look for the British to adopt American openness if juries there begin to acquit whites who were insufficiently deferential to violent black and Muslim rapists. American courts will never adopt the Brits’ wise version of a closed proceeding.Technology along with epidemic corruption and incompetence have made the United States’ legal system one more shameful aspect of the dying Global American Empire.

        Forget the juries. We need better prosecutors.  Prosecutors have incredibly broad discretion. No reasonable prosecutor would ever have charged Penny in the first place.  The jury wouldn’t matter because there would not be a jury to consider the case.The real problem is the weaponization of the law by prosecutors across the country. Not only do you have politically motivated prosecution, but their discretion is being abused by their failure to prosecute members of the favored group.  It is why Neely was even on that train to begin with.  In a fair world, he would have been in Rikers where he belonged. Just as a habitual offender alone means he should have been in prison.  Almost every US state has some form of habitual offender/menace to society statutes.  Neely is who they had in mind when they wrote these laws. They are for men who endlessly commit petty crimes, any single example not worthy of long prison sentence, but in totality being a one man crime spree.  There should not be anyone on the street with 20 arrests and convictions.Another recent abomination is the 1960s Giddeon decision.  Courts around the country do not have enough public defenders to provide all the defendants with their free PD and get their cases dismissed on speedy trial grounds.  Atlanta is an example with many cases being dismissed for the lack of public defenders.  Almost everyone confesses at arrest and then pleads guilty.   Petty criminals should not be automatically given a publicly funded defense attorney.

            Forget the resume builders called prosecutors. We of the USA need better so-called law*, better philosophers, fewer law schools, and fewer imperialists who want to save the world. In fact, we need to knock Columbia off her feet and to cut off her head while she is struggling to regain her footing. Each of the provinces aka “States” likewise must go, for they are legacy institutions poisoned with the gross fraud to which they have been attached for most or all of their histories. The USA must be swept into the landfill of history with corporate capitalism.===* “this Constitution” is clearly fake law (but D. Perry swore an oath or affirmation to uphold it anyway.) It begins with a big lie which, in addition to extreme historical inaccuracy, imputes authority to every man, woman, and child whatever the person’s character, intelligence, knowledge, understanding, or wisdom. Now this abomination is being used to drag the people to extinction, as could have been predicted from the content and tone of the Declaration of Independence, too.

            I’d like to agree, but having judiciary being a branch of government is an inherent conflict of interest because the prosecutor is a paid employee of the plaintiff in the case.  His paycheck depends on getting satisfaction for his employer, whether or not it is just.
An obviously flawed but better answer that removes the conflict of interest is private arbitration/courts and private “prosecutors”, with the state only authorized to carry out the punishment and/or restitution or to grant clemency.

                NO. NO! A thousand times, NO!  I am for banning consumer arbitration and I cannot imagine criminal arbitration would be any better than consumer arbitration.Why do you think all the corporations are trying to force consumers into arbitration? Hint: It’s not because it’s better for you.  Because the arbitration companies are the paid clients of the corporations.  Do you think you can get a fair hearing in front of an arbitrator your opponent is paying for and is an ongoing client of?Furthermore, arbitration is final and cannot be appealed in 99.999999% of cases. They don’t need to follow the law either.  They can blatantly ignore the law and almost no court will hear an appeal.  Their attitude is you agreed to it (like you have a choice) and you cannot appeal because you don’t like the outcome.

                    The problem is not the arbitration, but who gets choice of arbitrators. Yes, corporations (which, remember, would not even exist without the state) are going to choose arbitrators who skew one way, bur why would a consumer choose that venue?
If you really want to help the “little guy”, the first thing you need to do is beat that stupid contractualism idea out of your head. From the time when a serf had to put an X on paper to signify his agreement, the whole point of contractualism was to screw him.

                        I support ending consumer contracts of adhesion and especially, any contract clause which limits your constitutional rights, like access to the courts we pay for.  It’s been an American’s right to file a lawsuit for centuries.If we were to set up criminal arbitration courts, the charged would not have a right to chose his venue, just like prisoners have no right to chose a prison, even in the private prisons.  Plus, just like private trash collection, it would be just another scam. You cannot choose whoever you want to pick up your trash. You have to choose from 2 maybe 3 preapproved trash companies, all of which are exactly the same, overpriced and terrible.

I kept reading to see why that would be a bad thing, and evidently, “scam” is the best you came up with?
Let’s say they took the case to some scam operator, who delivered injustice. It goes to the state. Assuming the state is the competent, just operation of your argument (characteristics of the state not in evidence, I’d note) why wouldn’t they just grant clemency?

        I’ve been optimistic about Penny’s chances for a hung jury because even ferals have the sense to be afraid of ferals, thus at least some of any ferals on the jury will probably empathize with the defendant. Ditto for the immigrant, most likely. Deliberations being in their 3rd or 4th day is a good sign. Pessimistic about an acquittal for the reasons Zman and Jack Dodson state. In this particular case, I submit that Penny would be in far greater peril if being judged by a jury full of AWFLs than a jury of feral negros. In other cases, perhaps involving more abstract questions of law, in disputes between white people, is where you might prefer the AWFLs. Unless it presented an opportunity for them to virtue signal, which they will always seize.

            That’s a good point, very few people are immune to crackhead fatigue, the only exceptions are probably the AWFL demographic you mentioned &amp; fellow drug addicts. I figure anyone on that jury thats been on the subway in the last few years &amp; isn’t one of the immunized groups is going to be at least somewhat sympathetic to Daniel. Hopefully his lawyer picked people who use the subway all the time, the more exposure to psychotic druggie pests the better.

                I had a commenter at another blog lambaste me for making a similar point – he/she claimed most who ride the NY subway are “law abiding” workers.  LMFAO.

                    Were now in a situation where someone could in all seriousness argue that someone who has been arrested multiple times for smearing feces in people’s faces isn’t actually a criminal because the charges always get dropped.I’ve actually had this argued to me with the classic “innocent until proven guilty” line thrown in as the cherry on top of the shit cake, so to speak. Used to be people wouldn’t dare make such a ridiculous claim but this sort of blatantly fallacious lawyer style argument is becoming very common now.I didn’t realize it at the time but when the whole gender thing really became popular I see now in hindsight it signaled the next evolution of denying observable reality in favor of projected fantasy.Even the mundane things are subject to the most ridiculous propaganda. You say groceries are more expensive? You got a source for that, pal? Says right here on this graph that wallstreet is doing great so actually you’re more financially well off than you were four years ago!Any time I encounter this now I just plainly ask the person to explain my reality to me now lol. Like go ahead please explain whats actually happening, my lying eyes are always deceiving me, I need constant updates from experts like yourself to correct my erroneous perception.

                        Oh, believe me, I understand.  Earlier today I complained to my husband about a Daily Mail headline stating that Amber Heard was ‘expecting’ her second child.  Meaning, she used IVF or artificial insemination with some stranger’s sperm and rented a womb.  God, I hate the manipulation of language and reasoning and so I hate Klown World with the heat of a thousand suns.

                            Reminds me of an article a while back with a picture of lena dunham in a bikini &amp; the headline said she was ‘stunning.’ Then of course the comments were all glowing in agreement, naturally anyone who disagreed was censored.The worst part is there’s no escaping it, there’s not one facet of daily life that’s not somehow infected with the subversion to some degree. I especially hate the subtly condescending examples like these, its like being around a pathological liar where you both know everything being said by them is bullshit but its considered a faux pas to call it out.I do have to admit I enjoy not going along with it for the reactions it often elicits. For example I was asked to donate to a tranny organization when checking out at the grocery store &amp; I said sorry I can’t afford to fund the mentally ill to sexually mutilate themselves. I was totally deadpan when I said it &amp; the lady was shocked with this ‘how dare you’ look on her face.Its like I laugh about it but its really not funny, in reality I’m just doing that to cope from the psychological terror of such extreme degeneracy being normalized. On a side note I’ve since committed to driving ten extra minutes away to go to a store where they don’t ask for donations.

        Criminal trials are a joke and Ted X has covered torts/malpractice. But civil trials are also a nightmare. In our business dealings, we generally insist on a contract with a “waiver of jury trial” clause. The reasons are obvious: as bad as some judges are, in a business dispute you’re almost always going to be better off with a “bench trial”. Jury trials probably cost the country billions of dollars in higher insurance costs, business frictional costs, legal fees etc, not to mention the obvious loss of social cohesion.

            All of the commercial contracts that I have written or approved have very strong arbitration clauses…No one wants to pay a lot of money to try a case in front of a group of idiots? And the bigger the money, the bigger the incentive to arbitrate and/or settle the case….Often both…

I would much rather deal with a professional, well-paid arbitrator than a jury box filled with clowns.
That said, there is a subset of people out there who are outraged about the arbitration clauses many corporations insert in their user agreements.
Is that outrage justified, or are those folks just caught up in romantic notions about jury trials?

                    A little of both.  If Walmart is inserting an arbitration clause on the back of your grocery receipt, that might be a bit much.  In b2b dealings, it make sense.  In consumer actions, I can understand some outrage, especially if the arbitration fees are split or footed by the loser.  If your $800 Sony TV is a lemon and it will cost you $5,000 to fight it, then the arbitration clause is little more than a way to avoid warranty obligations.

                    Theory aside,in effect“forced arbitration” closes the system, protects its workings from outsiders (who may well be idiots). It’s normal corruption.If you think whoever’s lower on the existing hierarchy shouldalwaysget screwed—if you’re a happy merchant selling cars that trap people inside and burn them, or selling sawdust as bread, or pajeet code as American—then it’s to the good. No arbitrator will ever stop you…unless some larger competitor wants them to.Allowing juries into the process runs the risk of some corporation somewheremaybehaving to pay for its crimes. It never happens, and if it did the cost would be “passed on to the consumer”—to the great pleasure (sexual) of conservatives—so who cares.Arbitrationsignifiesattachment to the present system—the whole thing, from Palantir hunting down MAGA guys to put in the gulag, to your local teacher sneaking hormones to a “gay” six-year-old.USA!

                        Depends on how the arbitration clause is written. Can pick them pretty much any way you want.  Most b2b will include minimum qualifications or picked from an industry identified group (healthcare, intellectual property, etc.).

            Jury trials are actually rare. Most cases are plea bargained. A few years ago, a local, long-time Superior Court judge retired. A reporter asked him what percentage of defendants in criminal trials are guilty. His reply: they are all guilty.  They went to trial because their crime or criminal history was so egregious that their lawyers could not get   a lenient plea bargain. With a trial, they  might get a sympathetic jury or a some error that justifies an appeal or re-trial.

                Depends on the chief prosecutor of the district. We had one years ago who was extraordinarily hard nosed. Everyone went to trial. He won in 95%+ of the cases. I’m sure he cost the public a bundle, but no one complained as to cost. 😉

        As I recall with Rittenhouse, at least one and possible two women on the jury held out for two or three days until some idiot from MSNBC tried to follow the jury back to their hotel to dox them.  That trial was much closer than it should have been and without the old white guy judge would have been even worse.There are signs New York is going to correct at least slightly.  The mayor who is trying to cozy up to Trump to stay out of jail made some positive noises about Penny. I would imagine the murder of that health insurance CEO is also going to cause a swing back to blunt the bad PR.

        ‘The civil rights revolution was an act of revenge against the capable and it is reaching its logical end.’It was a disaster of iniquity and celebrated tribal resentments.  But it was a top-down imposition of the elite classes, not a grass-roots movement of the ‘oppressed’.Once JFK was outta the way — and the National Point bloodily made by our handlers — LBJ and his associates took over.  CRA ’64 and the Immigration Act of 1965 followed quickly, sealing the doom that the 19th Amendment began.Once I realized (the hard way) that the courts were full of moralistic Progs and female judgelings who should have been home baking cookies for their grandchildren, I fled.  America ain’t no place for a man like me.  All that place can think to do is cage me or kill me.

        The jury thing is important as it is one of the foundation pillars of society.  According to anti-racists, an all White jury must be suspect because Whites can not be trusted to judge non-Whites impartially.  But Whites are expected to receive justice from non-Whites?   It doesn’t make sense.  Regardless of which way the bias swings either the victim or the perpetrator can not expect impartial judgement to be done in a multi-racial [multi-identity] society.  Who can believe in such a system?

            Yoran is an Israeli-born, Jewish, anti-White, ‘Restorative Justice’ Communist lesbian married to a Peruvian BLM activist.
Yoran’s claims to fame include being the first attorney to successfully prosecute a “White supremacist” as a “domestic terrorist” in the United States,…
Yoran’s father is the author of ‘The Defiant: A Story of Jewish Vengeance.’
Yoran has continuously referred to Daniel Penny as “the White man” throughout his trial, assuming that the jurors share her view that “White man” means “Nazi”…
Because there are Dafna Yorans everywhere in the system.

        The phrase “jury of your peers” has its roots in British legal tradition, the Magna Carta, specifically. Brits being Brits, they use words differently than Americans. To Brits, “your peers” means “your aristocracy”. America rejected the idea of aristocracy by birth, and instead tried to implement aristocracy by achievement, a meritocracy.
“This will never do!” shrieked the proto-egalitarians, and their answer, as with their latter-day equivalents, was to redefine “peer.” We went from juries of the smartest, most accomplished men in the community to whomever can fog a mirror.

        Today’s post is yet another example of why we are not going to talk our way out of the mess we’re in. Pissing and moaning about the present societal insanity is not going to change it. Daniel Penny took affirmative tangible action to prevent a crack addict from doing harm to innocents locked within a confined subway car. He was not wrong to do so. We the people have the same obligation with respect to our corrupt system of governance. This problem is soon to become existential and only tangible action can save us. You are either part of the problem or part of the solution. Choose wisely.

            Well Tom, I think you hit the nail right on the head.Normie and Griller have to stop running away to the couch or the patio BBQ – sure it’s all fine and dandy to see big Donk cities devolve into the planet of the apes – but if you sit on your hands and do nothing about it… pretty soon the apes will start showing up in your town. Not trying to preach – but I am the voice of experience. We come from leftist hive families and they eventually destroyed themselves. What they’ve done to their families, they will do to the nation. And – when it burns, they will never accept responsibility for it.We should all accept the fact that we are at war now, if we don’t start shooting… we will lose everything.

                    The typical normie lament when faced with dire reality is to whine “well, who am I supposed to shoot?” and then go back to the couch. That attitude makes you easy pickens when they go fully feral and start sucker punching little old ladies on the street. It’s your duty to know what to do when the time comes.

And how does that differ from @Filthie’s position, which is to ignore someone being raped? In what respect does that differ from going back to the couch?

                                Agreed. Same-same. BTW, reread that section on Caesar, and keep in mind what kinds of coins were clean under temple law, so which coins they should have brought. By their own temple law, they declared Caesar their god.
I’m just a little disheartened that you don’t extend the same to the “grillers”. They are enjoying life and family while they can, and, presumably, are also only coming to the aid of their own families. Just like you and I, at least for now.

                I am sympathetic to this sentiment, but white people who stand up in this way will be made examples of whenever identified.  Whites are the only group to whom the law still applies with ruthless certainty.  So each man must ask himself – am I willing to go to prison and be bankrupted to help maintain order and save the system from itself?   All while it turns his wife and children against him with uninterrupted full-spectrum propaganda.You protect what’s yours because you must, but all beyond that is on its own.  If a jurisdiction could be built where sanity prevailed that might be different, but schlomo hates nothing more than a confident, functional white community – no matter how small.  Going to be tough to build such a place.

        Penny is most likely to be convicted on all counts and spend the rest of his life in prison, the prosecution would have done things to save face if they were not confident of a conviction.It will now be open season for every thug and crazy to attack people in the subway or any place else in NYC.And this is exactly what the City Prosecutors want. They chose to charge Penny with the max instead of some bs misdemeanor that would amount to time served in jail or something. The ideal city that Alvin Bragg who wants to be mayor is:A. Filled with criminals and crazies of diversity.B. Filled with illegal aliens who also make up a not insignificant part of the above.C. Drive all decent people and corporations out of the city.D. Get massive federal, state, and NGO grants to vote farm and provide a hell-hole from which chaos and attacks can be unleashed. An antifa plus with diversity armor.However, this is an old model based on peacetime. All we are saying, is give War a chance. Peace is over, if you want it.Serious peer-to-peer warfare, not shambolic Special Forces Olympics against tribal people with potato-level iqs and no industrial warfare capacity requires a serious society-wide marshalling of forces. Which means turning the US’s premier city into Mega City One is a no-go. There is a serious financial squeeze going on as the US finds its losing in Ukraine, will lose in Taiwan, and faces the chance no longer very small, of losing Alaska and Hawaii in any big war against China and Russia together.The effect of making crime legal in NYC will be Federal Troops taking control and running it for the next twenty years.

            You are right to worry about Alaska, but no war is needed in the plot of the story. The Russian Empire’s claim to the land was very weak in Seward’s day, and you can’t legitimately sell what you don’t own.The Russians have a wedge issue here to develop into an international crisis. It’s very much to their advantage to roll back the Western empire in that part of N. America. A problem is preserving their claim on northwestern Asia.They have a reputation, arguably deserved, for being less harsh toward “indigenous” peoples. So perhaps they have a fair chance of working a regime change operation of their own, right here in North America. Suppose that they make a secured promise to the tribals to affirm sovereignty of the latter. In return the Russians obtain rights to plant a military base or two in Alaska, which helps the tribals with their problem of how to deter aggression by Canada and the USA. Given the decine of the USA’s reputation, who other than Jewish supremacists and the USA’s stooges in western Europe would support the USA’s claim on Alaska?Hawai’i may already be allocated to the Chinese in exchange for a promise to support Alaskan liberation and keep the oil flowing to China. If so, the Japanese had better smarten up and be quick about it. Both Russia and China have strategic interests in evicting the USA from the Pacific, esp. the western region. The eviction will look like a virtual fait accompli should Alaska and Hawai’i be detached from the DC, even if the USA retains control (for a time) on other islands of the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese meanwhile would find theirselves on the wrong side of history again for the third time in 200 years, assuming that Alaska and Hawai’i are lost by the 2050’s.Here, too, no war is needed to capture the territory, Hawai’i. The population of Hawai’i is only a few million, equivalent to one or two of China’s many million-plus cities, and it’s easy to slip migrants into the USA. Conquest by settler colonialism. Now how much imagination does it take to foresee the Chinese seizing control of Hawai’i without rattling a single saber?If they’re really shrewd, they’ll seek the substance of control while maintaining the superficial appearances of US sovereignty. Once they have a grip on the “State”, they’d have two senators and a rep in the Congress. Then they start chipping away at the DC’s control over its military installations on the island. If I were the Chinese, I’d be helping the Hawai’ians to make life for whites in Hawai’i so horrible that all but a few flee to the mainland. Clear the place of the USA’s Constitution nuts, flag wavers, Zionists, “free market” think tankers, and veterans. The Chinese should leave no white veterans or like minded persons on the islands to provide moral support to the US military there.

        Man, is this guy getting hosed.  This BS should never have come to trial.  Now he’s on knife’s edge.  I hope to hell he is rightfully acquitted, but I’m not confident – at all.  What a dirtbag country this place has become, with an equally dirtbag legal system to boot.

        When called on for jury duty, one should go, just for the one time experience.  It’s not something you can buy a ticket for.  Strangely I have never been called up, but I know others who have been called many times..  I don’t begrudge anyone who has done jury duty once for trying to get out of a repeat experience.My wife was on a criminal trial jury for attempted murder.  She gave me a run-down of the case, and it was pretty obvious the guy was guilty of trying to kill his girlfriend.  When it came to deliberations, some were not convinced. Then one of the jurors came up with a completely silly train of “logic” that convinced the simpletons to convict.  So, Justice was served, but only by chance.  Seems like a helluva way to run a legal system.

            I got called in to Jury Duty last year at this time, even though I pointed out on my questionnaire when it got to the question “Do you know any one who works in law enforcement or government?” I answered “Yes, my wife, a lawyer for the State Department of Child Services.”I get in the cattle call and we watched a video that I swear to the heavens above could have been titled “Jury Trials for Kindergartners“.Did you know the people trying and defending the accused are lawyers, sometimes called attorneys?Did you know the person in the robe that sits at the front of the courtroom is a judge?You’ll be asked to listen to the testimony.You’ll be asked to be quiet while the trial is in session.🙄  As I told my wife “As if nobody on Earth has ever watched a police procedural or legal drama.”Then to my surprise I actually got called into voir dire. For a trial on alleged child abuse. Which, as I mentioned above, my wife investigates and tries for a living. 🙄Then we got the voir dire questions. If I thought the video was dumb, oh Lord the questions they asked (“Does anyone have a problem making decisions?”). We went into the jury box 14 at a time (12 primary, 2 back-up) and when the Prosecution asked “Does anyone have any experience with DCS” my hand went up and I had to explain:My wife was an attorney for DCSShe investigates cases like thisShe’ll be in this very courtroom in the new yearStates attorney looks at her notes, looks at me, says “Oh yes, Juror 19, the one with the spouse who works for DCS” 🤦‍♂️Amazingly I didn’t get any further voir dire questions. And I was dismissed.I got $18 for a per diem.

        The maxim that anything that hints of discrimination is immoral has resulted in jury selection becoming little more than drawing names from a hat.
Dear sir, it is far worse than that.  It is not random at all – should you use a peremptory challenge in a manner deemed racist, sexist or anyist, the judge can nullify your choice.  Thank our SCOTUS for that idiocy that puts the “right to be on a jury” ahead of the rights of the persons with actual, real skin in the outcome.  What f#ckheads.

        The last time I was a juror was a double murder case. A black woman had shot to death her philandering husband and her teenaged daughter (using his pistol [he was a security guard]). The case was unusual in that the crime had been committed years earlier and the defendant had been in a looney bin during that time. I thought she was a victim of her psychiatrist, who had put her on Prozac, after which her behavior became bizarre, culminating in the shooting of her beloved daughter (the shooting of her husband was not so bizarre). Her lawyer did not plead insanity, so we had to decide the case based on her obvious action. We found for two counts of second degree murder (because of diminished capacity), which probably meant a life sentence for this fifty year old. The jury was mostly white people and rational (the trial was in San Diego, which is the whitest large city in California).

            IANAL, but here’s what the Magna Carta had to say on it:
“No freeman is to be taken or imprisoned or disseised of his free tenement or of his liberties or free customs, or outlawed or exiled or in any way ruined, nor will we go against such a man or send against him save by lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land.”
They created two different ways of convicting someone — either the king (“law of the land”) or some arbitrary number of nobles (“peers” — more than one) rendering judgement.

        If I were going to court today, I’d make sure my public attorney’s face was that of a very dark-skinned Hispanic female — and all the real, backup lawyers were competent white men.Given the affirmative action environment prevailing in today’s world, you can count on your minority lawyer being terrible — but getting better treatment in the courtroom by everyone including the jury. Look at the white female prosecutor of the O.J. Simpson trial. The black women on the jury hated her, and freed Simpson because of that.Have the smiling face of a minority. And the thinking brains of whitey.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
