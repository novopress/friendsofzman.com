        And i hope you fall flat regarding the blackberry prediction, because they are the only “adult” phone maker around, everyone else produces data miners which can as a side feature also make calls.
The Denninger comment is also the funniest thing i’ve read so far this year, hilarious!

            I’m not sure what’s going to happen with Russia. There’s a lot of moving parts to the new Great Game. It’s very hard to forecast the actions of the incompetent. The people running US policy are only good at finding the wrong solution.

        I hope your Superbowl tip is better this time. Last years pick nearly cost me my thumbs with local bookies.Your stirring of soccer always makes me smile. I don’t mind the sport but I love seeing the fans getting their knickers in a twist.As for the race riot, I would like to think that it would only ever happen once with the rioters learning a nasty lesson they don’t forget. However, there are two things wrong with that thought. The first, that the majority are so terrified of standing up for themselves and the consequences that would follow. The second is that the rioters don’t seem to have the capacity to learn their lesson.

        On the subject of Apple, I got an iPhone after getting ripped off on my second Androin phone (Motorola Electrify M, shocking junk). It would be hard for me to go back to a buggy OS with a buggy browser and rotten voice recognition.
Only the Android offers is that the Android GPS app darkens the bsckground at night. The blinding white iPhone at night on a dark dashboard is dangerously idiotic.
Other than that, f*** Android. I’m done. They don’t fix bugs. Ever. Almost a decade in, and they’re still in Beta. Pathetic.

        Research and development have in fact greatly shrunken during the fiat money era. Free money is used to prop up government and reshuffle assets, mainly financial assets, not to innovate and develop. All progress is made into the wind of a hostile environment.

        Look at the huge Apple earnings, for example. Profits &amp; earnings are at record highs. Fed money is only a small part of this bull market, the rest is due to improving economic fundamentals. I think we’re in a sweet spot economically of low rates, low inflation, and strong growth. The reason why the dollar buys anything worthwhile is because of free market innovation, and innovation is only spurned by encouraging people an companies to invest instead of horde money in the bank, which explains why monetary policy is the way it is. If you suddenly cranked up interest rates from 0 to 16%, the dollar would surge and savings account holders would be happy, but the economy would get annihilated. Companies would find it impossible to borrow and everything would fall apart. Economic policy should benefit risk takers because they are the ones who create innovation and advance the economy.

        Alexis de Zman is not to be quibbled with, but #3 may surprise. The shape of the market points higher, much higher, and right away. That is entirely a reflection of financial repression, governments answer to providing for it’s increasing ambition by leaving the payment on it’s exponentially increasing indebtedness minuscule. Zero interest rates rob traditional savers and retirees of at least four hundred billion a year. Pension funds are forced into stocks when they see they will not be able to meet their future obligations while traditional safe investments languish. Even large banks are buying the S&amp;P index. We are likely past the point where wise, decent, and honorable men could provide a politically rational plan to climb down from this. But even Wiley Coyote could not levitate forever. Enter Black Swan.

            I look at the market P/E and it is a little over valued, but nothing like before the last two crashes. Improving profits and more free money will push the market up like we saw in 2014. The great unraveling will come, but not until the dollar unravels and that’s not happening anytime soon. The greenback has become the soma of the world economy.

        Purely of interest to this side of the Atlantic: ” The English Premier League will go bankrupt.”Maybe closer to the truth than a lot of people would like to admit over here, but you have to factor in — and you would not understand this — that such is the tribal appeal of football (oh, okay, soccer then) in these islands means that someone, sowmhow will prop the circus up. There has been lot of Russian, Saudi and south-east asian money pumped in to pay inflated wages but the vast bulk of soccer exists, and thrives, below the Premier League. My team plays a rung lower, and do I care about the likes of Chelski and ManUre? No way: they are full of transitional players here for three or four years and lost to other places. No one cares as there are always more unpronounceable names on the horizon who can be persuaded to learn enough English to say “I like zis score goal but it team game” and other such platitudes.No, I want my team to tread all over some other lesser light, and there is enough support to keep the game going. Football (soccer) here is about tribal passions, not money in the end. Nottingham Forest hate Leicester, Leeds are detested by everyone and so on.And yes, English fans think Scottish football is hilarious.Soccer across the country is about the glory at the final whistle, not the money. It can go if it wants, but every fan wants the win more than anything.

        Happy New Year to you.  As always, an excellent piece, but I am shocked by one omission.  No place for Ted Cruz in the Presidential roundup?  He’s the Jim Jones of the conservative wing of The Cult.  Every mouth breather ready to grab an ancient Winchester and take out the Demon-rats in the name of the Constitution has a hard-on for Ted Cruz.  He’s the savior who fights.My guess is that Cruz will self immolate with the base before the year ends.  Cruz’s tough-guy obstructionist shtick will lose all rationale and effectiveness in a Republican dominated Congress that expects and is expected to get things done.  McConnell, McCain, and the boys are just waiting to knee-cap him.  Cruz’s groveling apology to his colleagues after his latest ineffective stunt was a tell; the old Cruz would never have given an inch.Cruz will lose his only Senate ally as Mike Lee, facing a tough re-election campaign in 2016, succumbs to pressure from the plutocrats of the Mormon establishment in Utah like old man Huntsman;  Cruz, realizing that it takes big money to buy a Presidency, and cut off from the GOP establishment slush fund, will be forced to grovel even further before the likes of Sheldon Adelson, who appreciate his position on Israel but think he’s a vulgar, right-wing nut.  By the end of 2015 Cruz will look like the Cuban Newt Gingrich, and will be advocating open borders once the sham border security bill that he sponsors with Rubio, McCain, and Graham lands on Obama’s desk and is signed.I also predict that the Clintons will go nuclear in 2015.  The Clinton machine is already working over Webb, and the election is two years out.  Obama’s race held Hillary back in ’08.  The Clinton camp did originate the Birther meme and the gay stuff, but they had to hide behind so many firewalls that it was easy for the media to discredit those attacks as racist conservative lunacy.  This time the gloves will come off, and there is nothing like a girl fight.  Hillary probably sticks a pin in her Elizabeth Warren doll each night before climbing into the sack with Huma Abedin.  That’s why Warren is hesitant to declare – she knows what’s coming.

            Cruz is not going to run. His old lady works for Goldman and Cruz has a safe seat in the Senate. He gets to play the role of conservative firebrand, while the Goldman cash flows like water into the Cruz bank accounts. Not a bad setup. You don’t give that up to run for president unless you think you can win. He’s a young man, just 45 this year. He would be wise to look down the road at a run in 20 years. Do his thing in the senate. Run for governor of Texas. Then run as the voice of the Right in 2028.
