        Hrrrrmmmm. I‚Äôve wondered about this stuff too.I know we can pretty much dismiss the idea of mnemonic drift. Current bibles translate almost exactly to the Dead Sea scrolls which are 2400 years old. That in itself is remarkable. To my knowledge no other texts or documents in use today have survived so long with such fidelity to the original script.Perhaps it would be more accurate to say the church adapts‚Ä¶ but the Bible is pretty rock solid, Z. I note with some merriment that our (((Greatest Friends And Allies))) are eager to help us edit the New Testament so as to make it less antisemitic!üòÇüëçAs a Christian I see perversion and blasphemy everyday and it no longer offends me at all. I see the devil claiming lives and souls and I just yawn. Nothing‚Äôs changed ‚Äì the devil is what he is but YOU have to invite him in and sign his contract. I personally see no need of a third testament. Unless, of course, we are going to let the devil revise our Scriptures too?The Bible says what it means, and means what it says. It‚Äôs been doing that for at least the last 2000 years. There is a reason it has survived intact, with the voices of its creators coming through loud and clear today.

        ‚ÄòPerhaps for Christians, there is a Joseph Smith waiting to be born.‚Äô
Declined. Joe was an occultist, treasure-hunter, and general purpose loondog. That rap about ‚ÄòMoroni‚Äô was hilarious. . . L. Ron Hubbard, eat yer heart out!
‚ÄòThe way to view the Gospels is as part of a marketing campaign‚Äô
So, we‚Äôre back in the Temple and He‚Äôs over in the corner, making a whip out of rope?  The things of the spirit are as foolishness to you, an indecipherable language.

            Maybe a third testament, perhaps a collection of yet unwritten texts, adapting the core message of Christ to the modern problems of a technological society, is in the future.Essentially what Smith did.  But that is why Mormons are not Christian.  You can have another false prophet such as Smith, and there will be/are many of them now. But revelation closed with the death of the last Apostle so whatever they are they are not Christian. That type of path is simply not available to the Church.What can (and seems to) happen is ‚Äúre-interpretation‚Äù of the existing text much like what happens to our Constitution. But this silliness has been around for about 60 out of 2000 years, or less than 3% of the Church‚Äôs existence.  This too shall pass.

                While modernity does have some problems in need of new solutions, most of what ails the churches is failing to uphold Christian teachings and morals.  A compromise here, an update there and before you know it, you‚Äôre preaching on behalf of sodomites and promoting sin of all kinds.  Would the Catholic Church be in so much trouble had Vatican II never happened?  My guess is not.  Letting the homos in meant they were unleashing the homos on the children of the faithful.

                    Yeah.  The modern Prot denominations have embraced modernity also, substituting for a real church.  Feminist women, homos, guitars.  Churches for babied generations.

                        Yeah, I think that‚Äôs probably part of Z‚Äôs point. It‚Äôs not really that there will be a third testament that adapts to modernity. It‚Äôs that it‚Äôs already here. Those are all symptoms of a greater drift.
Guitars probably aren‚Äôt that big of a deal, though. I‚Äôm sure there were fuddy-duddies clutching at peals and ‚Äúwell, I never‚Äùing about David breaking into song to prophesy, or those who praised Him with strings or trumpets or timbrels or clashing cymbals.

                            There is still at least one large denomination, Church of Christ, which forbids any musical instruments at all in the worship service. They sing all their hymns acapella.

        If Jesus was God in the flesh, the God who created the universe, then the idea that He is capable of managing the content of the Bible that has been preached in His name for 2,000 years seems a trivial matter.

            It‚Äôs a very small step from that conclusion to the idea of God controlling every aspect of the believers and preventing them also from erring or blaspheming verbally, controlling the tongues of all preachers, ministers, and all people bearing witness to His message. But there‚Äôs this thing called free will involved somewhere. Above my paygrade.

                God creating and controlling the universe but allowing free will is basic Christian philosophy. Negate free will and you have Monism, which means God is the creator of the evil men do, since His will is the only will that exists.

            I‚Äôd upvote this comment a million times if I could. Ultimately, Faith in Christ is ‚Äòopt-in‚Äô. Years before I converted to Orthodoxy, I had the same need for ‚Äòthe details‚Äô. Constant debates about some author of some text in some time or other.
Then, I just said: ‚ÄúI have Faith‚Äù.
Never bothered with the debates again. Just shut my mouth, and worked for Christ‚Äôs sake. Paul, of course, warns us about pointless arguments.

                Agreed. Either one possesses faith or one does not. All of this scholarly pettifoggery about who wrote what when and the proper formulation of the Trinity, for example, while interesting enough as a mental exercise or intellectual history, is totally inessential. Either you believe Christ‚Äôs central message or you don‚Äôt. Nothing much else matters.

                        Jeremiah says you will find Him when you seek Him with your full heart. Leave aside the ‚Äúfull heart‚Äù thing. Have you even bothered to half-ass it? Or do you insist on bullet lists and PowerPoints?
I blame the schools. For at least half a century, most teachers have just given the answers, and students bleat the answers back onto the test paper. Most people do not have the faintest idea of how to learn.

            For true atheists, who areincrediblyrare, it‚Äôs the same. ‚ÄúNo further questions.‚ÄùReligiosity, spirituality, faith‚Äîwhatever word‚Äîis a sense I don‚Äôt have (or an insanity I don‚Äôt suffer, but I don‚Äôt think of it that way). When people say they ‚Äúbelieve,‚Äù I have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about, what experience they‚Äôre referring to. The God of the Bible is a barely sketched character in an incoherent text‚Äîlike Doctor Benway inNaked Lunch‚Äînot an entity I can have feelings about or a relationship with. Jesus seems to have been year zero Ted Kaczynski (or Charles Manson), if he existed. I haveno conceptionof what Christianity is to Christians. I know it isn‚Äôt the texts of Christianity, which they rarely seem to know.So I take Christians as they are and as they do. They‚Äôre the anti-white, increasingly non-white (they cheer), disproportionately gay liberals who destroyed civilization (because Jews told them to? maybe). Christians were also thewholly differentgreat men who made the West, long ago, while believing completely different things‚Äîalmost all of which contemporary Christians condemn. Christianityisthat condemnation.I think of Putin‚Äôs cathedral. It‚Äôs a shrine to antifascism. He means to displace the content of the local orthodoxy with contemporary leftism, as we have (but he‚Äôs not into gay shit). Would the church fathers, seeing his cathedral, recognize it as theirs? I can‚Äôt imagine that. But there is a sense I lack.

        The Catholic Church put out documents in the late 1800s to explicitly warn against the sort of ‚Äúadaptation to modern times‚Äù that you discuss, under the guise of ‚ÄúAmericanism.‚Äù Unfortunately, the post-WW2, post-Vatican 2 Church pretty much ignored all that, which leads us to the situation now. Thankfully, the Church has not gone down the same route of, as I said yesterday, the queer pastor telling us God is nonbinary. But it still has not been good enough.That said, the Catholic Church is well-equipped to handle anything that gets thrown at it, the question is whether or not it will. For many decades, it has not. But those decades are but a small fraction of the time the Church has existed. If there is one thing we know for absolutely certain, the people in charge of it now will not be forever.

        Why was the Gospel of Saint Thomas left out of the Bible? Probably because it was not anywhere near as popular as the Synoptic Gospels.This is absolutely wrong. If you read that slop you will know on the spot that it‚Äôs uninspired gnosticism, not even of mythological/fanfic value like King Arthur or the Divine Comedy.By the way, the oldest copies of many ‚ÄúLatin pagan classics‚Äù are often as recent as the Renaissance. The oldest Talmud is from the 14th century. The gospels are freakishly well attested compared to just about anything else and it suggests very high literacy among early Christians.

        It‚Äôs interesting how sects like the Mormons and the Anabaptists are treated like they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù Christians by the old sects, yet it doesn‚Äôt seem coincidental that these unorthodox believers that actually practice what Jesus of Nazareth preached in their daily lives are the groups of Christianity that are currently thriving.
Contrast with the old sects where most practitioners just mouth the words once a week before going back to living materialistic lives not much different than modern non-Christians. Materialism seems to make everything it touches sterile, which isn‚Äôt really that surprising I guess.

                        Talk to me in a few decades. The system is trying very hard to turn out Mormonism and Utah. There is evidence it is succeeding. Some people on our side have commented on it over the years. As usual they targeted the women first and have been flooding it with migrants the past four years.They have also been trying to normalize polygamy for the country at large, in the process, of course, making it totally degenerate and disgusting. Not that I support it in its ‚ÄúUtah form‚Äù, I don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs clear the system has targeted this part of the country for destruction.

                        They cucked in the 70s on blacks. They cucked even earlier than that on polygamy, though that was probably overall a good thing. Not only did they cuck, they excommunicated anyone who wouldn‚Äôt abide by the cucked rulings.Every time their religious views conflict with globohomo, they will cuck.  They‚Äôre just a little late to the game.They take great pride in their alleged tendency to be very nice.  Being nice is fine, but plan B should always be making them fear you.  They cannot please their enemies with niceness.  Their enemies hate them and want them destroyed, the very same people who hate us.

            There is a reason, for sure, why the Mormons have been under attack in popular culture for the past decade or two. Think of that TV show ‚ÄúSister Wives‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBig Love‚Äù, or all the shows about Amish leaving the community and becoming total degenerates. But I also think that the Mormon institutions have struggled in the face of the attacks, especially the universities. it seems like BYU is following the same path that Notre Dame did 75 years prior ‚Äì and why not, the same tribe is in charge, and it was so successful in South Bend.

        Z-man‚Äôs point about the ‚Äúliving‚Äù Constitution is right on‚Ä¶Our Constitution was in fact a contract between the 13 States in which they delegated some of their rights and powers to a central Government‚Ä¶And those States quite intentionally made it difficult to change the terms of that contract, which of course annoys the left and the warmongers‚Ä¶so we had a long process of making up reasons why our Government could ignore Constitutional restraints‚Ä¶The current Supreme Court has been gradually walking that back, always accompanied by howls from the usual suspects..But consider your reaction to your bank changing the interest rate on your ‚Äúliving‚Äù mortgage contract, say from 5% to 7%‚Ä¶on the grounds that it needs the money‚Ä¶..

        I grew up in the Deep South and have listened to a lot of fundamentalist preachers on the radio over the decades. Several interesting broadcasts stand out in my memory. One said that the Palestinians were the descendants of the Old Testament Philistines and God hated them anyway and they deserved to be exterminated. Another broadcast from a different preacher said that since President G.W. Bush kindly asked the Israelis to please stop creating illegal settlements on the West Bank, a couple of weeks later, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast. At the time, I wondered, if God wanted to send a message to George Bush, why didn‚Äôt He direct the hurricane up the Potomac to the White House? Then, a few years after that, Obama asked the Israelis to Pretty Please stop building illegal settlements on the West Bank. Shortly thereafter, some sort of straight-line hurricane-force wind roared across the Midwest, causing considerable destruction. This the preachers also said was God‚Äôs judgement.Millions of otherwise sane Americans have listened to these guys since radio was invented. Is it any wonder we‚Äôre stuck to this tar baby in the Middle East?

        One major clue indicating that the New Testament was written and disseminated within the first half-century after Christ‚Äôs death is the lack of references to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 A.D. ‚Äì except in prophecies. Paul‚Äôs letters still talk about a church in Jerusalem. Such a cataclysmic event would have warranted mention.

            Frankly, that is a very thin reed. That could just as easily be explained by story tellers editing the story to make them feel like first hand accounts to the intended audience. More important, it is not necessary to date the Gospels to the time of Christ. The dating of the texts has little bearing on the text and its history.

                The argument that the Gospels and Paul‚Äôs letters were written hundreds of years after the events is often used to attack them as concocted. Acceptance of them having been written and disseminated within living memory of said events is a huge boost to their credibility. A.D. 70 was (and remains) a catastrophe for the Jewish people, something they still mourn today. There‚Äôs no way it would have not been mentioned.

                    Notice I did not say hundreds of years. It is a matter of fact that the first Bible was compiled in the 4th century, but the Gospels and the Letters of Paul were first century creations.

                I‚Äôve also seen those verses used as proof that Jesus was a prophet, since the temple was destroyed within a generation afterwards.The New Testament seems much more solid in proximity to the days it describes compared to the Old Testament.  Even with internal biblical chronology you have Moses writing about events thousands of years before his time. OTOH Bible scholars will tell you those books were edited and revised up to at least Maccabean times.

                    There is a ton of speculation with all of this, of course, but scholars think mark was first compiled in 60 AD. That means there were probably people still alive who witnessed the events. Since the first scribes were relying on oral stories, those stories most certainly contained some first hand accounts, but how much is hard to know. We also know that people have terrible memories and often remember things that did not happen because they make the story work.The Jewish Bible is most certainly apocryphal in large parts. For example, the journey through the desert business was a story the Jews borrowed from other people. The flood story goes back to before the Jews.

                        The gospels use a lot more literary techniques than i had noticed before I started studying them seriously.  The writers used them to focus on important lessons or insights.

Certainly. ‚ÄúJews‚Äù didn‚Äôt exist as a distinct line until Judah, long after Noah. The question remains whether it was before the people known for at least the last few millennia as Hebrews. Was it a borrowed story, or are Hebrews descended from Noah? Does it really matter?

                                    Unlikely to be coincidence. Irving Finkel the cuneiform expert at the British Museum (Yes, I know, Volksgenossen) who has some really interesting and sometimes very amusing content on YouTube has a pretty convincing theory which goes like this:There was a typical pattern in the Fertile Crescent and environs in ancient times that when a people was conquered, you‚Äôd cart them off and resettle them where it suited you. Reason for this being that in hydraulic empires your power was a function of how many people you had to work on extending and maintaining irrigation plus doing the manual work in the fields.You also carted off those of the conquered aristocracy you didn‚Äôt kill and worked on assimilating them ‚Äî which in Neo-Babylonian Big Chad‚Äôs time meant sending the boys to scribe school and training them up as royal pages, etc. What this meant was that a lot of intelligent already literate in their hick-town backwater way Jewish youths got dropped into a truly vast sea of cuneiform literature already 2+ thousand years old. It‚Äôs like taking all the North Sentinel Islanders (with reasonable IQ) and giving them Shakespeare, Xenophon, the Vedic Hymns, and the Lambda Calculus + every Marvel comic ever written. You going to get something come out of that. Might or might not be pretty, but they and their religion is going to Change with a capital C.Gilgamesh ending up as Noah is just the obvious part. Must be plenty more where that comes from.

                                        Factually correct, but still conjecture. Doesn‚Äôt really explain how those hick-town backwater youths ended up with a more plausible ark than the geniuses did.
How would the North Sentinel Islanders do if given the crap we were told about covid and climate change, for example?
I doubt Finkel‚Äôs story explains other cultures with very similar flood stories as meso-americans being held captive in Babylon, too.

                There is another important point as to why the destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70 would have been important to mention: it marked the literal, point-of-no-return end of the Jewish religion based on Mosaic law and rituals. Records of the Levitical priesthood were destroyed, no more animal sacrifices: even if they wanted to (and many do) rebuild the Temple, any rituals would be illegitimate since there‚Äôs no way of confirming a true descendant of the line of Aaron.The Judaism that we know today owes much to the Pharisees in exile: the same Pharisees who were so hostile to Christ. They took over the spiritual leadership of the Jews after the destruction of the Levitical priesthood.

            @ JannieUh, I‚Äôm no Biblical scholar but I don‚Äôt think the church in Jerusalem that Paul was referring to was the second Jewish Temple. My understanding is that he was referring to the Christian church in Jerusalem, that is to say, the followers of Jesus led by James. Nevertheless that doesn‚Äôt weaken your argument. Jesus quoted the scriptures of his time ‚Äî the Septuagint. There‚Äôs no reason to think his disciples were any less literate than He. Well, maybe a little but they all came from the same class of common people. There‚Äôs every reason to believe that written accounts circulated very early. The lost Q ‚Äî the source of the synoptic gospels ‚Äî was likely written within a decade of His life. It‚Äôs reasonable that His sayings and deeds were even beginning to be put down in writing within His own lifetime.

                If the Gospel and other New Testament writings were doctored, amended, concocted, whatever, in order to ‚Äúmarket‚Äù Christianity, the tamperers would have surely inserted the events of A.D. 70 since they were a clear confirmation of Christ‚Äôs prophecies. The fact that said events are not mentioned indicates to me that the New Testament is reliable, first-hand, and unaltered.

        The core wisdom embodied in Christianity has served its adherents quite well over the past two millennia. Western European peoples thrived and advanced, and eventually gave us the Renaissance, Newton, classical music, and modern medicine. That is no trivial achievement. One could argue that it advanced the evolution of the species in the realm of nurture and augmented what nature afforded, particularly with respect to brain development and mental functioning. Religion is an important asset in our continuing development and should not be cast aside, as is now happening due to malign forces.

        Christianity has spread throughout the world because it was carried to these places by Europeans. Had it arisen a couple thousand miles further south in, say, Chad, it would have gone nowhere. Oh, but what about the converts: they must have have been persuaded by the theology, right? Not really. Latin Americans adopted Catholicism because their leaders were dead, and their conquistadors decreed it. Some leave that church for Mormonism today because its message is brought by smart, fair-haired American boys who represent, to them, the best of whatEl Nortehas to offer.And what of the theology? One Mormon convert in Latin America became the butt of local jokes when he joined because he mistakenly thought he would then be permitted more than one wife. You see, Mormons thrive not simply due to their ridiculous doctrines, but because they are descended from the original American stock who hacked a civilization out of the wilderness of New England, the Old Northwest, and Utah. Those who don‚Äôt find any of this persuasive could just adopt E. Michael Jones‚Äô argument that East Africa would be a great success if they simply converted to Catholicism.

        On its current trajectory, the Church will resemble the Fosterites in a few generations.
Christianity was most useful when it was a militant religion building empires and unifying European ethnic groups. ‚ÄúGod is on our side‚Äù is great motivation for a believing people in a war.It worked well when Western people were more tribal, but the universal aspect of Christianity has led modern believers to love the Other more than their own blood.It is sad and regrettable.

        As much as my preferred form of government would be a loosely federated Catholic Imperium (with Space Marines!), I have always been intrigued by the Marcionite heresy, which is drawn from the oldest compiled canon: a proto-Luke and some of the more authentic Pauline letters.
Marcion‚Äôs dualistic theology solves certain epistemological problems (with the added benefit of making Yahweh the bad guy), without going down the Gnostic rathole. It is also more or less consistent with the Kenite Hypothesis, which is the most likely explanation for the development of early Judaism.
Merry Christmas, everyone.

        I accept that man had a role in assembling the scriptures, the ultimate question I think though is that we ask is this stuff that we have today in the Bible  true at all? Did this God really raise this Jesus fellow from the dead? Is the man called Paul or Peter really real and if they were real did they just make this stuff up about seeing the resurrected Jesus?I must admit that i go back and forth at times on what it all means and if its true or false or maybe half true and half false?But that might be the purpose?Man struggles on this piece of rock in the universe about everything else, why not our faith?.

        ZMan, I appreciate your take on the Church  and Scripture because you are a well rounded, thoughtful man.  I take it that you are in some sense a skeptic, but working out your faith in fear and trembling.I appreciate the thoughtful comments. Like you have said before you have one of the best comment sections online; my own contributions to it don‚Äôt show even a small bit of the thought that many here put into their comments.  I‚Äôm thankful to you all.Zman, what‚Äôs missing in this discussion is Holy Tradition which preceded Scripture (the oral tradition which was put to pen by the Evangelists) and through the lives of saints and believers continued and continues to shape our faith.   I know that progressives will use the same concept to justify transforming theology (interesting double entendres coming to a sermon or dissertation soon) but also underlying the liturgy that both expresses and shapes our faith.   I appreciate that another commenter pointed to the Nicene Creed as sufficient to answer the question ‚ÄúWhat do you believe‚Äù.I won‚Äôt go on, I can‚Äôt spend the time required to do a longer, well presented comment.  Anyway, thank you for your hard work and for my favorite daily online reading.  God bless

        I appreciate the sentiment that Western religions must adapt. ‚ÄúWoke religion‚Äù isn‚Äôt working.Mormonism isn‚Äôt either though. (Working).‚ÄúMissions‚Äù for the youth are now open to women at 19 years of age; it‚Äôs a vastly protected (and curated) experience.What was once a right of passage for boys becoming me, celebrated in their communities and returning to favor and marriage is now a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need no man‚Äù experience for women.The LDS liberalizing to get more converts in the short term while trying to liberalize by equalizing men and women‚Äôs roles will lead to their downfall in the long term.Declining TFR rates in the LDS already reflect this.I saw this happen in the Protestant tradition in my lifetime. The Mormons will be no different.(More is the pity)

        Late dating of the New Testament is the line in the sand of atheists and sceptics who recognize that it is crucial to underpin their objections to Jesus having predicted (in approximately AD 30), the events that ‚Äú‚Ä¶ will come upon this generation.‚Äù; i.e. the destruction of Jerusalem, the Temple, and the entire Jewish polity to include the priesthood, the genealogies etc. along with the deaths of an estimated 1.1 million inhabitants of Jerusalem (recorded by the Jewish historian Josephus ‚Äì certainly not a Christian sympathizer) that occurred in the year AD 70. Non-believers reject the idea that Jesus was who he said he was. So, they must assert that NT books showing Jesus, like God, ‚Äúdeclaring the end from the beginning‚Äù must have been written after the events.Christian Dispensationalists force Jesus‚Äô predictions two thousand years plus into the future, unintentionally aiding their opponent‚Äôs argument that he was a false prophet.Questions then arise though; if these were forgeries written post AD 70 with the ‚Äòpredictions‚Äô merely fabrications placed in the mouth of Jesus to fool gullible readers into believing in his supernatural foreknowledge, then why is there no hint, not a word, anywhere in the New Testament as to these cataclysmic events having already happened? Wouldn‚Äôt the forgers have wanted to insert somewhere; ‚Äúlook, Jesus foretold the fall of Jerusalem, and it happened.‚Äù Internal evidence alone questions late dating. As an example; if we accept the ~ AD95 dating of the book of Revelation asserted (on the flimsiest of evidence) by skeptics, how is it that John expresses no surprise when in Revelation 11:1, he‚Äôs told to rise and measure the temple, nor does he ask the question; ‚Äúwhat temple ‚Äì the one destroyed 25 years ago?‚Äù. It would be like someone today being told to go measure the World Trade Centers and just responding; ‚ÄúOK‚ÄùIf someone seeks to know alternatives to the views of ‚Äòmost scholars‚Äô, there are resources available (example John A.T. Robinson‚Äôs book; ‚ÄúRedating the New Testament‚Äù) to help improve understanding. Or you can simply accept without questioning, as a freshmen student in one of Bart Ehrman‚Äôs Religion classes, the idea that it was all made up long after the eyewitnesses were dead.

        Zman. You should stick to culture and politics. You are, unfortunately, uninformed and not at all authoritative about the Christian faith or the Bible. I suggest you not only actually read, but study, the Bible, or just stay in your lane.Daily reader here.

        There is a verse in 2 Timothy about ‚Äúevery word of Scripture is inspired and useful‚Äù that people use to insist that each and every random verse is important.  Which is weird when as you say, the Bible didn‚Äôt look anything like it does now until much later.  Maybe they meant the Septuagint? It is perhaps a reason we have KJV-only churches now, people want their bible to not ‚Äòlive‚Äô.I wish bible scholarship was more inspired, but it seems many scholars lose faith as they go along or wentinto it to disprove the Bible (Eg, Bart Ehrman).

            I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll not get much inspiration from many scholars‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve become far too accustomed to ‚Äòproving‚Äô stuff was correct. Trying to meld theology with ‚ÄòThe Science‚Äô. It‚Äôs worth noting that, in one theological school I was acquainted with, not a single one of the lecturers, as far as I could discern, was actually religious.I appreciate Z Man‚Äôs take on the matter of Christianity and the compilation of it‚Äôs core documents, but it also seems like an effort of an inquiring mind to uncover the truth. To prove it‚Äôs true ‚Äì when really, Faith that itistrue is what is needed.An orthodox priest, one that I respect highly, told me this: ‚ÄúFaith is a gift from God.‚Äù. And it‚Äôs true. Simply believing the things I believe are enough, there is no justification required on mine, or any others part. That‚Äôs why I used to cite the Nicene Creed to anyone who asked about my belief.God is on the one hand knowable in certain ways, yet completely unknowable in others. That is good enough for me. Who am I? Just some human that hacks around on computers for a living. Christ‚Äôs words, and his actions, of course, are a continual inspiration. I cannot speak of the comfort I had, when diagnosed with a serious cancer, of the thought of the afterlife. The thought of where my soul will go to. My chance to be judged.As for an updating of Christianity to deal with modern pressures, I‚Äôm not sure it is even required. The same rules apply: the Afterlife is real, so serve Christ well. Kindness, love, virtue and stoicism are the orders of the day. Discern and avoid Evil. Keep an eye on your sins and humbly correct yourself, if you can.Anyhow, it‚Äôs been an interesting two article from Z, which I‚Äôve enjoyed reading. Merry Christmas to all here and, of course, Glory to God!

        The contention over the editing process of the Bible rests on the divide between the Pagan and Christian worlds.Pagans expect an editing process to change meaning as that is what pagans do when they edit religious texts. Christians view the editing process as a refinement of meaning and is neither a threat to the accuracy nor ‚ÄúGod Breathed‚Äù nature of scripture, which was the Old Testament when Paul wrote those words.Genesis remains an excellent starting point. ‚ÄúIn the beginning of God‚Äôs creation of the heavens and the earth, the earth was formless and void.‚Äù ‚ÄúFormless and void‚Äù is a Greek translation of a Hebrew phrase which originally did not have meaning ‚Äì ‚ÄúTohu wa-bohu‚Äù. ‚ÄúFormless and void‚Äù looks accurate but may need an additional sense of ‚Äúuntrammeled potential‚Äù. The Greeks were able to refine the philosophical meaning of the phrase, but it was not until humanity hit the hard vacuum of space that we could approach a physical understanding of it. Additionally, ‚Äúearth‚Äù should be expanded to material reality with a narrative point of focus on our planet since the text talks about the creation of stars.This example demonstrates why the refinement process is a necessary reality since humanity lacks the language and concepts necessary for God to write a finished version of scripture that humanity would be able to accept and understand. Divine revelation also should not wait, because it inherently spurs the development of the tools needed to fully understand the things Moses wrote about thousands of years ago. This is part of the evolutionary process of Christianity.Another necessary reality was demonstrated when God personally wrote scripture for Moses, which Moses shortly destroyed in light of Israel. God then had Moses rewrite the scripture he destroyed rather than the trivial recreation of tablets etched by God‚Äôs hand. One of the insightful points in this little incident is the fact that even if God handed humanity a finished Bible, humanity would toss it in the sea at the first opportunity and, excepting Moses at the time, falsify it with their own writings. Scripture has to be curated by the worthy as a Church-level project in direct cooperation with God. Humanity will not allow any other method in practice, and as long as the cooperation with God and the standards of worthy curators remain, it will continue to succeed.In contrast, Joseph Smith conjured up the Mormon mystery cult because he thought he was smarter than the Bible and wanted polygamy, both of which are wrong. This is not a hard call when it comes down to it, so a strong Church is well capable and will eventually sift out the worthy from the unworthy.The Book of Enoch was also properly excluded as far as I am aware. It looks like enemy propaganda, but I have yet to read it thoroughly.I do enjoy the posts and commenters here.Merry Christmas.

        Paul was writing epistles in the 50s and citing the words and acts of Jesus, which suggests that those words and acts were also being circulated in written form, since the Jews had a literate culture. Since books were very expensive, they were not carried around for evangelical purposes. Evangelism was done orally and the books preserved in the meeting places of the Christians and hidden from hostile authorities. When the Church put together what it considered authentic scripture (The Bible), it included only those works which they believed to be authentically apostolic, e.g., the four gospels. Some works were considered orthodox but not apostolic. Others, such as the Gospel of Thomas and many others were the product of 2nd and 3rd century Gnostic writers and were well-known to the early churchmen as fakes. There is an extensive literature by early Christians describing and critiquing these Gnostic works.

Of course not. That would expose you to the hazards of rebuttal and refutation. Seems like a cowardly approach, though. So please cite just three examples of outrageously bad mistakes.

                I won‚Äôt call it a mistake, but take umbrage to the assertion that the Bible cannot, should not, be used as ‚Äúmere inspiration‚Äù.  If not inspiration, what can it be?  The internal disagreements and selection decisions have been known for centuries.  What remains is spirit, which leads to inspiration, and that is eternal‚Äîespecially when we discuss the New Testament.

It looks like coded language used to disguiseprejudiceandemotional commitmentof believers.One believer is Trinitarian; another is Muhammadist. Both can cite ‚Äúspirit‚Äù as their basis for confidence in their respective scriptures while denouncing the other‚Äôs as Satanic. Not both believers‚Äô religions can be true, however, and, if they are like most believers, their confidence developed long before reading and analysing their heilige writing without bias.

If the message is timeless, then it should not have to adapt; else, it is not timeless.
Rather, the proper analysis would be that times which ignore timeless messages are soon over.  Often painfully.

        A Christian does not need a bible. Jesus lived and preached love. Love is infinite beyond time and space and certainly knowledge. The church including the Bible are rationally motivated and built on rituals and laws. All of this is hypocritical and subject to change at any time.
