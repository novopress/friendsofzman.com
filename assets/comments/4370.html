        A people who gathered once a week to pay homage to their religion were generally free to do  what they wished the rest of the week. Catholics made this into an art form. But it is my strong impression that the religion of equality is a daily affair in which apostates are immediately corrected, shunned, or banned.

        As far as I know (as a vegetarian) McDonalds do offer a veggie alternative, at least in the UK. Unfortunately it is like a lot of McDonald’s products and not very nice, but it is a matter of taste so each to their own. At least I can go there and eat something, and if the business is in decline it is more that there is competition for meat products elsewhere. Offering more veggie meals won’t save them.But to religion: you are right, you can’t be in a religion unless you buy into it fully. I know little about many religions but I don’t think they like casual believers as they might just slip away and not attend.In the UK, and I have banged on about this before so apologies, but we are being overwhelmed by a very religious group. I have little interest in their ‘faith’ but the woman, even if they are born here must wear something over their hair. I was served by one of the True Faith in a store the other day: nice young lady but I did want to ask why everything about her was according to the British way of life except that she had to have her hair covered. I admit I find it hard to believe God gets angry with women with uncovered heads; I would have through a supreme deity either doesn’t care or if He or She or It is going to get annoyed it would be with men who cannot control themselves when they see a few wisps of hair.Of course the young lady wasn’t allowed to wear a skirt either but then some men have been known, in any culture, to go a bit wonky when they see naked ankles, but as far as most people are concerned when they see females of the RoP all they see is restriction and suppression. Most religions are like that: it is better to repress than liberate.That’s why I won’t be joining any of them soon, though I am thinking of naming my house after a norse god just to piss off those who only think they have the only handle on salvation.In a very real sense the left is a powerful and domineering religion, as you have said before. Its adherents must cover their opinions and not show their true feelings. They must pray for salvation from some long dead economist, or ask for guidance from a show-biz airhead or pretend intellectual. Their prayers are cliches about poverty, education and global warming, none of which they do anything about but how uplifting to mutter those platitudes without thinking. Their holy text is reading drivel in the mainstream media.Britain has a problem with the beardies and scarfers (as someone amusingly called them) but like all western society it has a bigger problem with the religion of the left.
