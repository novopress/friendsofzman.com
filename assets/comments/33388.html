        Whatever the motivations of Musk and Zuck to change the way things are being done online, we can be sure that it isn‚Äôt because they care about us. Nor do I believe their motivations are especially financial. I tend to think that (Zuck especially) they are just trying to keep their platforms engaging to keep people occupied, lest they wander off and find something else to do. One way or another, the proles must stay plugged into the matrix. Now that TV news has been defeated, and can no longer be relied on as the mechanism for regime thought control and consensus manufacturing, the big internet platforms have to fill that role more than they were already doing. Which isn‚Äôt going to work if people aren‚Äôt on them.

        I Might quibble about your definitions, Z. To me, the troll is a gift from God. I‚Äôd classify you as one ‚Äì that guy who goes round popping the balloons of the pompous, self righteous and the sanctimonious with an elegant swipe of the verbal katana that cuts them off at the ankles!Fags like Cerno, Vox and Fuentes don‚Äôt have that kind of dexterity. They‚Äôre con men and eventually everyone sees it. They may actually be part of the journey to true dissidence. Back in the day I looked at these guys favourably at first but left them behind as their grifts and cons became obvious over time.People are looking for voices of logic, reason and genuine, witty humour. They want to meet others of the same bent. I see you promote Derb‚Ä¶ maybe you need to promote other serious dissidents? And maybe they should be doing the same?

            The grifter elements back in the day would have been part of Con, Inc. Richard Spencer, to name one such clown, tried to square the circle and went from dissidence to Serious Thinker and now appears ready to claw his way back to dissidence since winds have shifted.

                Re Spencer, he has posted on X/Twitter a selfie taken in LA a few years back. It‚Äôs just him, with some part of the city in the background, and the caption is ‚Äúthis is the last time I was in LA.‚Äù Where the sociopathy ends and the stupidity begins is hard to tell.

                I follow VD‚Äôs blog, I just don‚Äôt see much of what you are saying.  The last big spat he was in was with some retards from youtube called revenge of the cis or something.  That was several years ago.
His attempt to weaponize arbitration rules was pretty good. Even though he didn‚Äôt win, he cost patreon millions of Dollars.

                Yes, Ted is still at it.
He does occasionally make decent points on his blog. He also seems to be making a go of his publishing operation.
His most important contribution were his trilogy of short books about fighting SJWs. Those used to be free and they are a good gateway for normies to enter the fight.

                I still skim his stuff.  About half of it is self-promotion (HIS books, HIS publishing house, HIS comics, HIS genius), and another 30% is his latest 15 minute hate.  For months he was lambasting Neil Gaiman, and now he‚Äôs moved onto Brandon Sanderson.  The remaining 20% of the blog is often worth reading.

            In the meat space my bullshit detector is pretty good but even in everyday life it fails me on occassion. In the digital space my bullshit detector fails me a little more often because the digital face of these people is easier to manipulate and hide their true motives.However the bs detector still works it just might take a little longer, Richard Spencer and Nick Fuentes come to mind.The most important thing though is to have a bull shit detector in the first place.I have one on special, this week only, for $29.95. Email me for details!

Bullshit Detector
Giddy Bullshit Detectors are mentioned in a blog post titled ‚ÄúThe Drug Resistant Troll,‚Äù where the author humorously describes encountering a shelf full of these detectors at Cavender‚Äôs Western Wear. The author purchased a pair for $49.99, intending to give them as gifts to friends with upcoming birthdays. The post does not provide further details about the functionality or design of these detectors, but it suggests they are meant to be a playful and satirical take on the concept of a bullshit detector.

                The one thing all con artists have in common is they all make a good first impression (or at least try to). You could say the good ones make a good first impression and the bad ones try to and fail. Thus, everyone who makes a good first impression, or at least appears at the outset to care what you think about them, is suspect. Everyone who DGAS what you think from the outset is observably not a con artist.

                That‚Äôs exactly what she was. Owens at least briefly had what I termed a fully clothed OnlyFans gig, where she was charging X amount of dollars a minute to ‚Äúchat‚Äù with super fans via, I think, direct messages. It presumably was not sexual in nature but a way to get the full-fan experience of Candace Owens and to pick her monster brain on topics of the day. Michael Cernovich possibly pioneered the concept when he would get drunk and go on line and slur stuff about a million dollars fee to ‚Äútalk‚Äù with people in private chats.I would be at least one sucker paid Owens, and possibly even Cernovich shook loose coins.

                    Oh, it‚Äôs way worse than that. She used to be an SJW known as redpillblack (IIRC) and tried to run a doxing website where users could report wrong-thinkers. She publicly defended doing this, even against kids. After this and other failures, she saw how Diamond and Silk grifted white conservative boomers and jumped on the bandwagon. I cannot believe people fall for this.

                Owens first appeared about a decade ago as the public face of a doxxing service‚Äîanon-white, feministface you could trust to hunt down and expose your personalright-wing trolls, notify their employers and the women in their lives of their vile average-white-guy opinions, etc.I don‚Äôt think her company did anything but announce its existence before she abandoned it for the Based Black business. Her recent conversion from Shapiro pet toSuper Based!was similar in a way. No plausible conversion story, just suddenly: ‚ÄúBut now I know.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt believe conversion stories‚Äîevery late-in-life /ourguy/ is faking it, consciously or not, andwillrevert to whatever he was (with added rage toward us, because Freud was right)‚Äîbut they are a standard courtesy.

                    The default certainly needs to be late in life conversions are totally fake, yes. There is the liberal mugged by reality thing, to be sure, but that‚Äôs experiential more than intellectual and a bit more plausible.

                        Agreed. The later the conversion, the more suspect it is. David Horowitz‚ÄìI know, I know‚Äìconverted decades ago, and the conversion appears to be genuine. If he had just converted yesterday, I‚Äôd grab aholt of my wallet.

                    What happened to Candance is that one of the original GamerGate grifters (Joey Quinn) went after Candancehardwhen Candance tried to open her anti-bullying web site. That was a shock to her system, and started Candance down the road of understanding social justice. She is now naming the Jew, and has more subscribers than Daily Caller, so if sheisgrifting, she is going about it in a rather funny way.

            I agree. You‚Äôre absolutely right. For me it‚Äôs RC airplanes. Building them from scratch, off the plans in the old way. No apologies given, no F‚Äôs to haters. Most hobbies are just healthy expressions of the the manly arts!Are we not all trolls, really? And to mangle a metaphor: is not the troll in the eye of the beholder? I dunno how you‚Äôd actually troll a train modeller but I am sure it can be done.I have seen our Esteemed Blog Host say things to guys like David Fwench, Sloppy Williams, and Jonah Goldberg that probably seriously damaged their self esteem, HAR HAR HAR! And ‚Äì while the take downs of those cretins were works of art‚Ä¶ sometimes the best thing a guy can do is retreat to the man cave or shop‚Ä¶ and glue his eyes and nostrils shut, or cut off his fingers on the scroll saw, or crack a wing that took the last month to build. It all serves to remind us that there are far more important things in life to get hacked off about!üôÇ

            As always a good long (six hour) stream with Morgoth and Millennial to cap off the latest series. Was a bit worried for a while that there wasn‚Äôt going to be a good old-fashioned Morgoth Rant, but he came good in the final hour.

        The problem is too many people in our society have never been punched in the mouth. They run their mouths without consequence and to our civilization‚Äôs detriment, crowding out the social media space from responsible, rational people.
Maybe we should bring back the stocks and the pillory for these people.

        ‚ÄúMuch of what ails the modern world in some way traces its roots to the printing press.‚ÄùMuch of what we call the West traces its roots to the printing press, period.  Goods and ills alike.Keep in mind that the professional trolls are very likely tools of the MIC and IC information operations warriors.  Most likely, they won‚Äôt go away.  They‚Äôll just be paid handsomely by the DOD or CIA to do things the DOD and CIA can‚Äôt legally do.Trolls serve an important purpose for the government.  They can attack voices the government does not want to be heard.  And they can discredit ideas the government doesn‚Äôt want taking hold by making association with those ideas ridiculous/laughable.  Hence the clown show that many of these troll-influencers produce.As always, the safe bet is to simply avoid most forms of social media.  Comments sections are a form of this, but are still operating much like the internet did 20 years ago.

            How effective is that though? Musk‚Äôs focus on the industrial scale mass r@pe of White UK women since 1950 has been effective.And there are other players, much as we might not like it: China, Russia, Iran, all who want to destabilize the West and nothing better than pointing out the actual facts.The actual facts paint a ruling elite that since 1950 hate us and want us dead. There is no other way to put it. So its easy for those nations to play also, and they will.Ultimately social consenus and social peace and approval of ruling elites depend on performance. On either brute Stalin like power, or patronage and support: Caesar, Napoleon, FDR, etc. What amounts to marketing can buy some time, but as Z-man noted, the worst marketing is effective marketing for a defective product. It makes everyone hate the product and the company that produced it.Apple runs on the hate hate hate for Microsoft and charges an arm and a leg for it because most people can‚Äôt run Linux.

Sometimes it is short lived ‚Äì what I call the ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù IO missions.  We saw that with Harris‚Äô campaign which started to implode by mid September (as I predicted it would).
The more effective IO campaigns like COVID, Ukraine, and the GWOT can stretch in for years before the public catches on.

        How about the Unintentional Troll?  I scarcely use Facebook, but the few posts I have made usually include a mild humorous jibe at some group of people ‚Äì Folks who drive Mini Countrymen for example, or the people who live in the neighboring town.
Inevitably those posts generate a relative torrent of comments by people who took offense, which I find rather funny in itself, but these people appear serious in their outrage.
A professional troll must have an easy job jerking these peoples‚Äô chain.

        Sadly, the digital grifter is an addition to the problem and not a replacement of the old analog conman.  The old analog conman was a thief as is the new digital conman.  Only now, instead of (usually) having to be physically present to run their con, they can do it from anywhere, which has vastly increased the number of these thieves preying on the elderly and other vulnerable people.  Unlike the old con men, the new con men are largely shielded from prosecution as they live in other jurisdictions.The modern digital grifter is easily ignored.  But the new digital conman is much more difficult to ignore and he is much better at hiding his con.  I saw a heartbreaking video of an old woman in a 711 dumping money into a bitcoin ATM at the direction of an Indian conman.  Thankfully the police were called and were close enough to get there while she was still doing it.  He physically stopped her. The Indian on the phone was threatening her not to listen to the cop.   The police contacted the bitcoin ATM owner (who should be shot) and froze the money.  But scenes like this play out every day where no police are there to save the person.

            A few years back some Indian slimeballs kept calling my mom telling her that they were with Microsoft tech support and they needed to log into her computer to fix something about her ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù. I had set up her computer though and put Linux on it. All she ever did was browse the web and read email so I didn‚Äôt see any reason to put up with the pain and expense of Windows.My wife watches this ‚Äútrash TV‚Äù YT channel about romance scammers. Those guys all seem to be in Lagos (the real one). Internet scams must be a major component of the economy of much of the third world now. Calling these shithole countries ‚Äúdeveloping nations‚Äù is a sick joke. Most of them have done all the developing they‚Äôre going to, it‚Äôs just that the people there can‚Äôt do anything with technology except use it to steal.

            Takes a while to get over the feeling of betrayal. I never forgave the Right for giving us Bush 41, but 20 years later when we got The One, I finally got the stick out of my butt, and started focusing more on opposing the greater evil. I‚Äôd rather not have evil at all, but I was foolish to spend most of my efforst on making sure the lesser evil remained out of power.

                Their target was never unknown, though. Credit due ‚Äì Enoch/Penovich and the gaggle of clowns at TRS were never shy about their favorite subject.
