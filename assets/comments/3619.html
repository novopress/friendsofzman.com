        CaptDMO- you are wrong- most of the battles of the Revolution were fought in conventional European style- and the colonists lost most of them. Weapons dictate tactics- massed fire was the most effective tactic, and the Redcoats were VERY good at it. The British, for a lot of reasons, lost their will to continue. I hope we don’t lose our will in our fight against Islam. Of course that would require that large numbers of our elites recognize that we are IN a fight with Islam.

        At one point in time, officers of (ie, but not limited to)”The Redcoats” insisted their soldiers fight in nice neat ranks and files. It’s all they knew from “military history” where “attrition” was a tactic.(again ie)”The Colonists”, took cover behind rocks, trees, etc. They didn’t fight fair “by the rules”.The rest is history.Sadly full circle (tightening spiral actually) history.I could be wrong.

        You can’t just dip your toe into the seven deadly sins. Lie a little and listen for that giant sucking sound because you’re already in over your head.
“Truth is the first casualty of war.”–W.Churchill
“The Palace” must always be at war with it’s subjects because it is, by existence, a lie that can only be enforced by fear and violence.

        There is a reason Tony Blair is known here as Bliar. There are various ideas about what made him what he was, but while the Labour Party struggles to accept the idea that he was the first of their party to win a second term in office (Labour is notorious for choosing the wrong man to lead, the wrong policies no matter how many times they win one term to govern) they can’t bring themselves to admit he was the best of a bad bunch. A bunch that goes on repeating the same errors.Bliar’s plans to expand Labour voting potential by inviting in hordes of tribesmen is already falling apart, but like all politicians it was a short lived plan of limited vision. Bliar’s wife then made a good living from fighting for ‘human rights’ which usually involved the decline of rights for the indigent population.In both of these cases the decline of (British) society was assured: we will bring in more people who aren’t from this nation and care not to be, and then we will ensure they get everything while those already here get nothing.The collapse naturally follows such ‘good ideas.’

        The people in charge know the answer to the problem, they know what should be done, but as you say, that would require them to admit that they were wrong, wrong, wrong about multiculturalism. Hell would likely freeze over first.

        Z Man:I am intrigued by your frequent references to the Late Bronze Age collapse and the palace economy that went with it.  What is the best book on that subject?The Tainter book looks interesting.  I haven’t read Jared Diamond, just a few reviews.  Isn’t he some kind of environmental determinist?  Diamond always struck me as the kind of guy Ezra Klein would read on the subway to look smart.I’ve been circling around Spengler’s Decline Of The West for the last couple of months, but fear to take the plunge.  I tried to read him a bit in college but he’s daunting.  What is drawing me back to Spengler is that he refuses any easy links between Classical, Near Eastern, and Western civilization; despite common features they are separate entities.  For Spengler, for example, Orthodox Christianity has more in common with Islam than it does with Catholicism.  While the commentariat prattles on about the need for a “Protestant Revolution” in Islam, Spengler pointed out that Islam was the Protestant/Puritan revolution of the Magian civilization to which it belongs. Whatever one may think of that theory, it opens up interesting avenues of interpretation…

            1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed
I found that one to be accessible and a nice summary of the subject. It’s one of those short little books that punches way above its weight. It does not try to be a scholarly work or show off with esoteric language. I’m not a fan of esoteric writing as you can tell from own efforts here. There’s a lot to be said for getting to the point.
