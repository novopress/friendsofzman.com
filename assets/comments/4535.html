        If it was certain that guys like Tsarnaev could get life in prison and actually stay there, I would be OK with eliminating the death penalty. But it usually happens after 20 years or so, whining about their changed attitudes, finding of Jesus, poor health, advanced age, whatever, begins, and the next thing you know the murderers are out.If you kill them, though, they are totally forgotten within a short time, except by members of their families and the families of their victims. Remember the whining about the woman executed in Texas a few years ago? Without help of a search engine, hardly anyone does. Whining, and problem, eliminated.

            Not quite true, JD. When you kill a Kennedy, life means life.

        Do it the old testament way.  Let the victims’ families decide.

        I am philosophically against giving the State the power to murder it’s own citizens, even under the color of law.  But, on a case by case basis, it is generally difficult to ignore the depravity of the crimes and of the convicted.  If it were an easy question, the “right” answer would be an easy and obvious one, too.

        We know enough about psychology, physiology, and recidivism to make the process simple, but lack the will.Psychologically, some people are unfit for civilization.  They need to be locked up.If they are violen and agressive, we understand the physiology of testosterone on the male, and should consider castration for those prone to aggression and violence.  Take the wind outta the sails and they’ll be easier to manage in or out of custody, with the bonus that they can pollut the gene pool.Finally, for those individuals who still can’t manage to not be evil or live by an ideology of evil so intense they need to be made an example of (*Islam*), dispatch them with haste as soon as guilt is established and put their associates on notice they are under surveillance and expect to be for a long time.  Make evil fear civilization again.Obviously the lone wolves won’t have a lot of associates, but the commies, revolutionaries, and Islamists do, and there are both paper tigers and sleepers in the mix who can either be flushed out or scared straight.  If they believe in their mission, they will own their bad seeds and convince the public to stand with them or expose themselves as nutbags.  If they are in it for the chicks, they’ll get on with their lives.  Either way, they don’t get to hide.But as a society, the vocal leftist minority wont allow these to happen.  They need grey area, chaos, victims, and noble savages.  At least as long as they atent allowed to imprison their opposition.

        I’d send Tsarnaev back to the  Russians with love and execute the people responsible for bringing him over here. The Russians warned State about his entire family. And they were right. So clearly the government increasingly cannot be trusted to do anything well, except malice, and jury selection produces mice.
