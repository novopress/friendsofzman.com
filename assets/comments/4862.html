        “On the other hand, having the idle high on drugs probably makes them more docile so maybe the libertarians will make drug taking mandatory for the dependent.”
Look, I know you despise libertarians, but could you list a few of the schemes libertarians have decided were good enough to be made ‘mandatory’?

        Don’t forget that John Holdren, Obama’s highly prized science advisor, was closely allied with Paul Erlich in alarm about population — neo-Malthusians both. And shared the famous wager with Julian Simon about the depletion of a group of five key metals. They thought they would depleted, but all five were more plentiful and the price had decreased. Like many progressives it’s a completely negative, hopeless view of today’s real world and the future — unless we move to the glorious future of the progressives, or something like that.I am beginning to believe that progressives (the PC appellation) are just out of touch with reality since they get all their information from progressive talking points.

        I always thought it interesting that it was about the same time that geneticists figured out that there was some kind of instruction set embedded in cells that the “breeding charts” at CSHL were declared verbotten (in a manner that is very familiar to us now) and the serious effort was all shifted from “hard” eugenics to discovering the code.  I would argue that sometime in the 1930’s the Anglo-American branch of the the progressives switched from eugenics to genetic engineering.Of course it will be a few more years before we’ll start screwing with the germ line in any meaningful way, so I agree, the progressives, having learned that large scale coercion is expensive and painful, have settled on an interim, soft, gramscian eugenics:• Bringing a lot of smart, young people together in universities with roughly equal proportions of both sexes.  Likewise tearing down barriers to entry for women in most jobs.  Successful men therefore became very unlikely to breed with curvaceous but not too bright secretaries, but rather with other elite women screened and tested for desirable traits though 16-plus years schooling.• Incentivizing the washouts from the winnowing process to not have children, especially at the low end of the scale.• In general, promoting low fertility.  As large as the human population is right now, you are probably not going to miss some crucial gene just because one of the elite decides not to have children.The problem that this program is running into is that, like everything else the progressives try to control, the invisible hand of natural selection is very hard to stay.  This is my friend’s idea, not mine, but we have now had three or four generations of children in the developed world who have not been subject to much evolutionary pressure.  The waves of mass neuroses that we are experiencing right now are emanating from precisely those people who would have never made it past infancy, or at the best, early childhood in pre-modern times.  At this point we are now seeing the children of children of children who never would have made it to adolescence for all of human history.  Their kind has never been seen before for the very simple reason that their kind has never existed before in any large numbers.Maybe there is a good reason for successful men to be attracted to bubbly, curvy women.  Just like socialism, I don’t think this is turning out the way the progressives planned it.Maybe that’s why the Cult is so desperate to get women in combat jobs right now.  Their goal  was to produce the 1930’s Ivy League ideal of smart, athletic and socially adept.  Instead they got Emma Sulkowicz.  In that light, the attempt to make the military a 50/50 mix of the sexes is really a way to hedge their bets and create an athletic-intellectual caste.
