        In the corporate state, ideology is about as authentic and meaningful as corporate culture. It is just a veneer to decorate the latest HR effort to boost morale.

“Yeaaaaaah, so Peter, I’m going to need you to go ahead and worship black people this Saturday.”“And Peter, before I forget, why don’t you go ahead and worship gays on Sunday too. Yeah…. okie dokie, have a nice weekend Pete!”

                The “Resistance” turns out to be simply another brand name, doesn’t it? Marxist cultural identity politics as the sheepskin covering, corporate state “soft”  tyranny as the quiet wolf underneath

                    Antifa is just H&amp;M mannequins come to life.  At sunrise they go back to the store and take their places again.  Notice that all Antifa rioting takes place within five blocks of an H&amp;M.  In a few years they’ll have their own precise VALS marketing demo, Experiencer/Agitator and no longer be moved to violence.

            Taki’s has been going downhill for a long time.  I find it a bit surprising that Zman is joining them when Jim Goad left because he couldn’t stand the bs and censorship from Taki’s daughter who now runs the site.  For those who are interested, Counter Currents had an excellent podcast with Jim (and I, who do not listen to podcasts, actually listened to the whole thing).

                I’m not joining anything. I figured a little free lancing would keep me fresh. It is easy to let yourself get in a rut, so I always look for ways to avoid it. No one produces as much content as me, so variety is even more important.

                    Agreed. Expand the audience when you can. Taki’s is still a worthwhile place.
Btw, is it me or did you employ a slightly different style in the Take’s piece?

                Takimag has no vision, as Goad noted.  I guess it used to be a conservative version of  Esquire or even a de-sexed Playboy with its mix of smart society chat and intellectualism.   All it needed was a few good short story writers, but never went that route.  Maybe it should give it a try and form a fiction department.  I bet there would be a lot of good stories coming from people on our side.

                        Just read the Taki piece. Brilliant. An underused type of writing is the sarcastic humor. Think old National Lampoon. Or today’s Onion or Babylon Bee. We could spread our messages via short stories. Such fiction would have stiff competition from the absurdities that come from today’s politicians, like the cited Steve.

                Yeah right, did not know that. I’ve noticed a lack of articles coming out at taki’s lately. I’ve listened to a few podcasts with Jim as well. Interesting bloke. Hopefully he’ll still be writing somewhere.
A plus for takimag if Zman throws an article their way. I’d much prefer to read Z here though, too many good commenters to miss.

            I used to read taki regularly until they did away with the comment section which I always thought was pretty good. Still read occasionally but will be reading Z’s missives for sure.  The additional exposure can only result in wider readership.  Best of luck.

        Finally, like an employee that never fit into the corporate culture, you’re fired from the platform.
The writing has been on the wall for a long time. When I first started out, people returning from interviewing a candidate would always talk about if ‘they fit with the company culture’. At the time, I thought we ought to be recruiting based on merit; but this technique is exactly what we ought to apply whenever letting anyone into one of our circles – do they fit withourculture.

        One thing to advocate that would keep the corporations in line would be the concept of natural death.  Corporations claim the human right of free speech, so they should therefore accept the human fate of eventual death after 70 – 80 years or so.  Any corporation that reached the age of natural death should be wound up, it’s assets auctioned off and the proceeds distributed among the creditors and shareholders.  New companies can operate with the assets purchased from the dead corporation.  Also, no corporate bailouts, ever.

            Corps used to be severely limited, state charter for a specific purpose, say, build a bridge, and then wound up.
That was back when your children were your social security.  FDR allowed the kids to leave Ma and Pa on the farm (although many had no farm or land, as well), and go to work for FDR’s big city factory friends.
No immortal umbrella corporations, no pensions?  No, I think your idea resolves the impasse.  Kudos.

            There’s a huge problem with the line of logic that says America is just an economy with a country, one that our corporate owners never consider: people don’t sacrifice for corporations to the same degree they would a nation-state. Thus, such economies with countries tend to be much less stable over the long term as the likelihood of disaster increases (a war, a pandemic, etc. … all are inevitable with time). When disaster does strike a nation-state, the masses often come together as one for the benefit of all.We saw this wiliness to sacrifice for the greater good during the Second World War; over two hundred thousand American men died and many more were horribly wounded or psychologically damaged. We also saw this in Japan after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami: thousands died, but Japan pulled together as one; there were even stories of Japanese people finding safes stuffed with cash and turning them into the police rather than stealing them.Compare that to the chaos of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans: people were shooting at rescue helicopters; civilians refused to evacuate because they didn’t trust the government; the city was poorly managed due to its race-based politics of excluding White cops through zoning restrictions; police quite en masse just after the levies broke; mass looting; multiple murders and general chaos; gangs of White men with guns had to be formed to keep looters from sexually assaulting women, etc.If America is just an economy with a country, don’t expect Walmart employees do die fighting Target employees over product pricing. In fact, the only way Walmart can ensure their employees shop at their own locations is to bribe them with employee discount cards; some loyalty.No one sacrifices for a discount at another store, they just go to the other store to get the cheaper product.Thus, you can expect such fickle loyalties to serve the United States poorly in the future. For example, what happens when future hyperpower China offers American Whites a better deal? Will they switch sides? By Cato’s logic, they should.Didn’t the Soviet masses do exactly that themselves — destroy the USSR for coca-cola and Western music?It can be easily argued the Soviet Union was a profoundly evil entity. Nevertheless, it only reached into Eastern Europe in the first place because the country was nearly destroyed by the Germans; countless Russians died repelling the invader. Rather than preserve what millions of Russians died to build, they gave it all up for cheap takeout and shopping malls, letting their enemy surround them on all sides and humiliate them with economic sanctions and conspiracy theories in the process. There is a lesson in that. America, an economy with a country, may go the same route sometime this century as China offers oppressed Whites a better deal.

            “”Yeah, I’m pretty much a free thinker,” said Keeblesmush when interviewed at a protest rally sponsored by Kinko’s. “I would say my ideology is an eclectic mix of Vox, Marvel comics, Starbucks’ Twitter feed, and whatever my Sociology 101 professor says. There’s a lot of hate and misinformation out there, so it’s important that I get my life’s moral compass entirely from multi-billion dollar corporations and celebrities. The only exception is deadGermanphilosophers likeMarx. They’re cool too.””

            Centuries (seemingly) ago I actually interviewed there, but I do remember two things.  First, I would have had to wear a suit coat over a certain floor number, and second, they paid about 25% less for grunt-level IT work than anyone else in the city.  I’m sure by this point their IT staff is 100% East Indian.

Heh. The manager just got such a chap in as a contractor. Upon hearing of this, I did not say anything; I just remembered all the other times I have dealt with them. The shaking of the head when they agree with you, the broken English, the tendency to complete sentences for you…

                    My theory about the Indian invasion is that they get the jobs preciselybecauseof their incomprehensible gibberish.  The HR bimbos who now control hiring think “I can’t understand a word he says, he must be sooper smart”.  Interestingly, they also think this when interviewing a white computer guy.  The difference is that the white guy is hard for them to understand because he’s actually talking about technology subjects you don’t learn in Wammen Studies programs.  They can’t tell the difference between the Pajeet’s word salad and the grammatically correct tech-speak the white guy is using.  Add in that most of these bitches actively hate white men and Sanjeet is in.

                I kind of miss the suit jacket or sport coat as common workplace attire. Since I did a lot of customer-facing visits I did wear a sport coat a lot and I look good in one! I worked from home for more than 20 years but at company meetings I usually made a point of wearing dress pants, shoes, shirt and jacket (though rarely a tie. I have my limits).
Also, sport coats and suit jackets are great for concealed carry.

        Being a city boy, I have little to offer when shit hits the fan (like most other middle-class whites). How can I protect my family? How can I prepare now for what’s coming tomorrow?I have bugout bags prepped, a gun, and a place to go, but I feel that I’m not doing enough. Moreover, wife is a head-in-the-sand kind of person. As long as the cellular towers are operational, she’s unperturbed. And it is so frustrating. It’s as though people are offended by the idea that one day, their comfort won’t matter anymore.I watch her piddling on her cellphone, hypnotized, and I get angry. But can I really blame myself? Scientists and psychologists are employed by corporations to monopolize our consciousness, and it is easier to achieve this with women than with men. All of her friends are doing the same thing — what woman can resist that? Not many. I do love her, but if it weren’tforher, I would take my son and my family to Lineman country.This world is a Gordian knot of barbed wire. You can’t untie it. You can’t draw a sword and cut it in half. The only answer is to walk away. But even if you aren’t tangled in it, odds are that someone whom you love is. God, can’t they see what’s happening?

            Lanky, being working class with severely limited resources, what I did was grab a couple of redoubts.Rome wasn’t built in a day, so start looking for land, old homes, relatives’ homes, or old tax deed sales.(You can put your name on a property with a quickdeed, and put the required probate off for years, or whenever.)You don’t have to abandon what you have, but you can start looking, and building up towards a spot of ownership.I have cheap land and trailers for one, an old relatives home- anchor to a host of redneck network- for another.I don’t live in either, but I have places to bug out to. Already got kinfolk there.This is why guys in Wisconsin or Georgia or Oklahoma buy “100 acres of hunting land” or “a vacation home/site/cabin.”Tain’t much, but they’re all white, and the rednecks have a ton of skills, guns, and hunting experience.Holy smokes, I realized all my uncles are dairy cattlemen from way back- do you have any relatives you can renew relationships with?One moe- get more mobile.  Ask the missus for help, we need to clean out the crap and make some room here.  If the captain sets the direction, the first mate and crew will resist a bit and then be happy for something useful to do, they can see the results.

            Like the velocity of money, efficiency demands the movement of people. The less moored people are, the more efficiently they are moved from one area of the corporate state to the other. This also shift responsibility from management onto invisible forces no one needs to ponder. California is not failing. They are just reallocating resources from the California division to the Texas division, because Texas is booming!

Depopulate the cities. Regain ownership on the cheap.

            Absolutely no clue as to why this was done. I’ve considered every theory out there and none makes sense. There are still areas of the country that are culturally distinct and perhaps Z is right and the purpose is to homogenize them (with, among other things, diversity, ironically), but I don’t know if that is the reason. Maybe there isn’t a rational explanation. Some of this stuff has been insane with no apparent logic behind it.

                I know the old hippy artists, Mexicans, blacks and so forth are really pissed off at professional class millennials for coming in and making everything so expensive through gentrification that they had to pack up and move.
Downtown Los Angeles had a thriving artist district back before the mass gentrification.  Those people had a great life, huge cheap industrial lofts, local mom and pop bars and markets, etc.  Could do whatever you wanted.
Then came the hipsters.  And everyone hates the hipsters.

                Follow the money. The asset/wealth transfer that happened circa 2008 was nothing compared to what we’re about to see.  A lot of people whose livelihoods and small businesses have been shut down through no fault of their own stand to lose everything, while the Fed is printing money to bail out global corporations who engage in outsourcing, H1-B hiring, and stock-buybacks for the C-suite crowd.

        Streamlining and efficiency have invaded pop music.  There’s a guy named Rick Beato, who’s worked in the music industry for many years as a musician and producer.  He has a popular youtube channel where he talks about and analyzes music.  He claims that currently there are only the same 4 chords used for virtually every popular song produced today.  It’s a result of  corporations figuring out which chords are most popular.  He notes that the Beatles only used these 4 chords one time (Let it Be) among their 27 biggest hits.  He says it’s killing innovation and originality and killing pop music

                That’s funny, and depressing.  Reminds me what my musician acquaintance said in regards to two of the more popular modern religious tunes in that you couldn’t play them back to back because then people would notice that they sound the same.  “Why’s that?”, I asked.  To which he replied: “Because it IS the exact same song, but with different words”.

                    If you listen to pop, country, and Christian stations consecutively, you’ll be amazed at how similar the music is.  It reminds me of the Simpsons episode where Homer toured the Duff Brewery and overhead was one giant pipe that split into three smaller pipes that fed vats labeled Duff, Duff Lite, and Duff Dry.  In this case, the music is all the same but one kind sings about blue jeans and beer, one sings about how great their God is, and the third sings about how wet their love purse gets.

                        I have noticed the same thing.  I love old country music, but every damn song put out in today’s “country” music sounds exactly the same.
Like a pop song from the 1980’s sung with a phony Southern accent.

            Rick Beato is a great, talented guy. His song breakdowns are incredible.
As for chords, I can remember taking a beginner online guitar course, and the instructor had posted a huge list of pop songs based on three, two, and even one chord.
The other issue with popular music is that almost every track is built around the 4/4 time signature.

                More branding, eh? Kubrick was Breitbarted two months after “Eyes Wide Shut” got out.




Breitbart was Breitbarted after he alluded to pizza! The DC Madame was found hanging in her mother’s garden shed- I doubt it was because of good old fashioned cisnormative rub-a-dub.

                    Well, Kamala Harris said they were “people of faith too” the other night at the debate, Alzaebo. That’s what I was referring to.
Speaking ofpizza, you wouldn’t believe what I saw the other night when I went to pick up some milk at the supermarket. Maybe I’ll write about it some time but not now. People will think it’s my imagination. But it confirms my belief that yes, there are children out there being trafficked.

            American elites are like the managers of a lower-tier department store. They hate their jobs, and their customers by extension, because it reminds them of their own mediocrity. That’s something these ivy grads just can’t take. Shouldn’t they be celebrated for doing important stuff, they think to themselves. Like saving the world (The Green New Deal) or something or other tech (Tesla). Instead, they’re stuck doing things they consider beneath them — selling Martha Stewart bed sheets and La-Z-boy recliners to the unwashed masses.They hate Donald Trump for the same reason they’d hate a wealthy hillbilly who walks into a Walmart clothing section and buys a mass of cheap $5 t-shirts they themselves couldn’t afford: it destroys their delusion that they are more important than they really are. They think to themselves they are the ones who should have all the money, and that the hillbilly shouldn’t have anything and is probably immoral for having it in the first place; they rationalize he must have stolen it or something because there’s no way someone like thatdeservesto have (or is intellectually capable of obtaining) more than they think they should have themselves.Thus, the wine-sipping left flipped when big mouth Donald Trump won the presidency, an accomplishment they will never have for themselves. They rationalize he must of stolen the presidency because it reminds the Left they aren’t as talented as they think they are.How could that loser have won? Reeee.No matter what happens in November, they can never take that away from Trump, so they’ll hate him forever.

            Typically, the non-conformists are exiled first, then it’s off to the re-education camps next, and if that doesn’t work, starvation and disease are useful tools of elimination with a less guilty conscience. Overt genocide is often the last resort because sometimes the victims will fight back when there is no alternative. And none of the above happens without a Jackboot Corp.

        As the assimilation of all the corporate assets continues, it is increasingly difficult to see the divisions within the managerial class.Is the end goal of this the complete assimilation of all business; right down to Joe the plumber? If it is, the tools are in place for such a push – demonizing capitalism is only a step away from demonizing small business; once the people have been sufficiently conditioned to hate such enterprises then they give the state licence to confiscate and maybe redistribute.This scary situation can only be offset by a selection of ‘frontier’ type risk takers; people who create business and in turn work and are looked upon as a force for good. But, the mainstream media has many convinced that such people no longer exist. People nowadays don’t want the effort, which is a great shame because numerous, distributed small business is a great antidote to the slow moving, Antifa appeasing, blundering yet highly moneyed cancer we know as Corporate America.

        Final stage: the company is no longer competitive but the brand still has value, so the money men buy it up on the cheap and carve up the carcass. If nothing changes, America will soon be a Walmart brand.

Fortunately the nation is the people, not a brand. This will (I think and hope) ultimately foil tptb’s designs.

        I always thought the ADL and SPLC were like the HR people you speak of. They monitor people’s speech and determine what is correct or not, then they speak to You-tube or Facebook and they cave in every-time.  The media then cites the SPLC or ADL study that the right wing commits all the violence and is the biggest threat while the left wing burns down Portland for 100 straight days, and finally the Deep State DHS or FBI determine it is White supremacists doing all the rioting and Joe Biden cites this to undermine Trump bringing up Antifa. Wikipedia also seems dictated by ADL and SPLC to write White supremacist under Jared Taylors name and lock the account so nobody can change it.  Google then makes sure in its algorithms to put the ADL or SPLC page on someone as the first thing that comes up.  Finally anyone like Ben Shapiro plays hall monitor or gate keeper never allowing someone 1 inch to his right to debate him because his boring Neo-con National Review talking points would get destroyed by Zman and exposed to a large audience.  Thus Ben Shapiro will never have Zman on for a debate which would surely be an eye-opener to his audience.

            Hear, hear!  Also remember, the Zman is expanding the /ourthing/ ad campaign to the mainstream.
Well done, nothing scary or offputting here, simply identifying the players.

            Three years ago Big Tech (Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Google) officially partnered with the ADL and the SPLC to censor speech with the blessing of the Uniparty. Apple even did a 2:1 match if their employees donated to the SPLC.https://tinyurl.com/yyx3hvsohttps://tinyurl.com/yyx3hvso

        Social media is a surveillance tool created for the purpose of eradicating wrongthink.  Behavior modification gets reinforced every time someone gets fired and exiled for wrongspeech.  The next step is to brainchip everyone.  Behold the transhuman race.

        Another congrats on the Taki article, I hope that becomes ‘a thing’. The comments section here, in fact, is sort of a throw back to the Taki comments section of yesteryear which was some of the best bantz on the internet. Top tier erudite comments with just the right amount of BadThink / sh1tposting stirred into the mix.The site is not what it use to be at it’s peak but it is still on my weekly read list. Great job.

                Get a Dissenter browser, or an extension to your whatever browser.

I’m surprised Torba doesn’t push Dissenter harder; Gab is an alternative to Normie social media, but Dissenter is revolutionary, disruptive: a comment section on each and every page on the internet, one that can’t be censored, except by Team Torba.

        I just read the column at Taki and they do not appear to entertain comments, so here goes. “Steve” is the limp dick that did not die on the savanna fifty thousand years ago (either because he was too slow or too stupid to avoid the lion). Instead of being culled by nature, his DNA now pollutes our genome. That is both tragic and suicidal for the species.

            This site has more traffic than Taki. There are people who read Sailer and Dalrymple that don’t know about this site, I’m guessing, so that’s a good reason to post a little over there. I don’t expect it to be a long term engagement.

            The specific problem with America is that the government is extremely hamstrung by the political charter written by slave-owning agrarians that didn’t have electricity or instantaneous communication networks. Moreover, the charter curtails federal power rather severely by leaving lots of veto options to lots of parties at multiple points in the process. In contrast, businesses in America can be as unfettered in their decision making structure as they want to be, and can thus be more assertive and responsive. Thus, people who want to make a difference would do well to start off in the corporate world rather than the political world. If you want to end the corporatization of American society, you’ll need a new charter of government that provides robust tools and clear direction for doing just that. The current charter simply can’t give our government direction or authority for dealing with our current problems.

                Our system was designed for the republican governance of independent-minded European Christians. It will not and can not work well in governing a multiracial empire. There are no examples in human history of successful multiracial governance that did not involve authoritarianism. That is why globalists and their minions are constantly pushing gun control.

                The Charter works pretty well when it isn’t ignored.  The Bible was also written by slave-owning agrarians, that charter also still works pretty well when it isn’t ignored.

            Great to see a Rocky Top mention. About 20 or 25 years ago I saw the group who wrote Rocky Top, the Osborne Brothers. Their persona and the music they performed were quintessentially Appalachian-American. Music that came from somewhere, reflecting a culture, and a heritage. As they left the stage, one of the Osbornes, after telling everyone to drive safely home, urged everyone to “buy American.” It struck me as kind of sad, a guy doing his best to fight against the rising tide of globalization.

                My favorite story from Appalachia is the story of Bill Monroe visiting the White House and waiting to see the President. A man approached Bill Monroe and told him that he always wanted to meet him, Bill looked at the man and said  in his southern drawl “ now what is your name?” The man said my name is Frank Sinatra after which Bill responded“ I think that I might have heard of you?”The other famous story about Bill Monroe was when he stayed in a Hotel serving a kosher breakfast. Someone came to his room and asked how was breakfast? Bill said there was no bacon or sausage and the donuts were hard as a rock other than that it was just fine!

        Yes, the quest to impose hive-mindedness on the plebs is sacrosanct; and at it’s core, it’s only tangentially about corporate efficiency. It’s real purpose is the prevention of an uprising. Worker bees must made into docile automatons that perform their function without question or complaint, not free thinkers. Free thinkers might do the unthinkable.

            Right around when I was graduating college in late 80s, the academic mission was still to teach critical thinking skills.  I guess that became too dangerous or “problematic” as Corporate Karen would say, and the new mission became indoctrination.  Even then, being a liberal meant you would study in Paris or Rome for two semesters and immerse yourself in the best Western Civilization had to offer.  That too would become a big no no.

                Critical thinking was and is a loaded term. Critical thinkers were never adjured to scrutinize the building anti-white consensus. Instead, their charge was to rhetorically disembowel western civilization. Critical thinking springs from Frankfurt School Critical Theory.

                    That was more the “deconstructionist” side of things, which became a rigid system if not an ideology.  Most professors in America operated outside of that and merely taught critical thinking skills in the sense of it being part of our Western intellectual tradition and could be encapsulated as “we are teaching you to vote smart and to make reasonable decisions.”   There was a pervasive “pro Western bias” and pragmatism that had nothing to do with the Frankfurt School or spiritual successors in the Humanities like Derrida or Foucault.

            And yet BLM, which is the unofficial enforcement arm of the anti-white fascist state, threatens to “burn the system down if [they] don’t get what [they] want.” These people are not free thinkers because they cannot think to begin with. Nevertheless, they do possess a primordial rage impulse that could destabilize everything the Diversity Despots have built. It’s an odd paradox.

        It’s an old argument that the die was cast once people no longer needed to worry about getting enough food to eat. The managerial state birthed the therapeutic state, and instead of worrying about bread and butter or roads and bridges the job of government is to make sure people never have bad thoughts (white people, that is). This is why comedy is such a battlefield (and why the German state security apparatus can say with a straight face that there is an internal extremist organization in the Police Department merely because officers share off-color jokes on their cellphones). Laughter lays the devil low.

        Zman’s article at Taki’s Magazine contains extraordinary observations, even for that site, e.g. “People complaining about racism are simply ungrateful. If not for white people, they would be living Neolithic lives. Like everything else about their lives, their ungratefulness is only possible through the generosity of the white man.If anyone has a grievance in this age, it is Occidentals who stand waiting for a thank-you that never comes. The demographic age question is what will become the genuine alternative to the progressive orthodoxy.” Answer: “A passive ethno-nationalism organized around group identity and rights.”

            Jim Goad is going to be a regular at Counter Currents.  And he indicated Heartiste (of the late and much lamented blog) was willing to write for Taki and Mandolyna was not interested.  Greg at Counter Currents indicated he was.  If they could get Heartiste to start posting again at their site, it would be a fantastic combo.

                That is criminal if that is true that they turned down Heartiste for a writing gig. Would have added much needed levity and acerbically biting wit to that site. National Review level full retard of wanting be ‘respectable’ when nobody actually cares about respectability.Also makes me wonder if they are loosening up the reigns finally since Z is definitely not Theodore Dalrymple. 🙂

                    I think you are wrong on this. She came on not long after they got rid of Disqus. I remember because I remember making the connection.
When you say “recently” I think you’d be surprised that she has been there for a few years.  All you have to do it go to Takimag and click on her name and see she has been writing there since April 2018

Mandolyna had been wroth with us for a long time, what with all the bagel baiting. Mind you, I don’t really blame her: a comment section must be a drag at best and infuriating at worst: a whole bunch of disrespectful assholes sat in the back seat, yelling snarky comments at the driver.

And I think Queen Ann told her the commenters were getting a little too risqué and could be construed as anti-Semitic and white supremacist and she couldn’t have that tarnishing her brand. So if you want big league Queen Ann Coulter you have to get rid of bush league court jester commenters.

                            IIRC, the ad service they were using started threatening them and then Disqus also threatened them. The truth is, no commercial site can have an open comment section. Too many people lack the required self-control. Even here, some people post the same comments on the same topics, regardless of the content that day.

            The funniest thing was that a few months after she’d nuked the Takitariat, she’d have a promo streamer saying, effectively “Give us shekels so you may join the famous Taki comment section”, leaving only the comment section paywalled.
Great thinking there, Mando! First you kick us out, then you try to sell us to the normiecon punters.
So that didn’t work out and then she paywalled the entire site and pulled the defunct comment section. And now she’s torn down the paywall entirely. In a few months, she’ll probably put up the talk board again.

        Perfect post.  Exactly what’s going on.  The only addendum is that it’s a corporate state that’s losing money, just as all enterprises at the end of their lifecycles lose money.  And it’s losing a lot of it, faster than ever.  Retail is the perfect example.  A successful retail chain will allow local management to have input as to what it bought for the store.  A store in Duluth would have a vast winter coat section, while the one in Miami would have a nice bikini section.  Today it’s all identical.  Only the format sizes are different.  So chain retail is failing.  But they can all blame Amazon.  Sure, Amazon is a big deal, but in reality Amazon is just as much capitalizing on the failure of product sameness and uniformity in box stores, who also pay peanuts to pierced drug addicts to not give you service.

        This corporatism will be the death of the West. We have no institutional civilizational rightwing to oppose this evil because money-first Republicans destroyed it by the end of the 1960’s. The only serious threat to corporatism is from the left.We will soon reach the time when nationalists, even civic ones, cannot get elected and we will have a one-party state. The only elections of consequence at the country-level will be Democratic primaries. We should be voting for whichever leftists will tear down and destroy the system the fastest. Build rightwing local government; destabilize leftwing imperial goverment.I expect that if Trump manages to overcome the margin of vote fraud it will be from diversity Democrat crossover. Establishment Republicans will be “Look! Look! 20% of the diversities voted for us! Our vision is winning!”. Most of the party of stupid still doesn’t get that 20% voting for you means 80% voting against you (and your civilizational existence), which is a staggering defeat. It may be enough to tilt this next election, but as their numbers grow and our shrink electoral defeat is inevitable.They will, of course, miss the even more important point which is that any diversity crossover is not a vote FOR Republicans, but AGAINST the rule of other perceived enemies. Cucky nice-guy Trump is simply the lesser of their immediate concerns. The hispanics, asians, and africans both don’t get along with each other and all have their own internal feuds: Mexicans vs. Guatamalans, Indians vs. Chinese, Somalis vs. African-Americans, etc. Most importantly, the non-African diversities all come from countries where the level of ongoing African-in-America misbehavior would NEVER be tolerated. They don’t like seeing it and they don’t like leftist whites who tolerate and encourage it.Africans in America are geographically concentrated, so Dems need African votes until they do away with the electoral college.If Dems fail to cheat their way to victory in 2020, then expect them to try to put a lid on the crazy for 2024.

        You’re pretty spot on. I’ve said this before but in line with this growing corporatization, I’ve noticed the millenials and younger have completely lost any sense of rebelliousness, skepticism, or anti-conformity. These things aren’t a good in themselves, and in the past they were used to actually accelerate this corporatist culture. But now there isnt much use for these things and only dissidents have them.It is just remarkable to me how on social media normie uncritically accepts every narrative, every value no matter how obviously false, stupid, or contradictory it is. It isnt just that these younger people wont question or rebel, it is that they will angrily and strongly defend the status quo.In a simplistic Christian framework, it is because the status quo enables their sin, and anything that threatens that has to be resisted. But more specifically it flatters them and also allows them to flatter themselves. Thats pretty hard to resist.

            Alot of them actually think they’re being rebels – young women believe they’re the first generation to have careers. Young men think they’re an edgy generation trying out drugs.

        That’s a fascinating take, Z-Man. And much of it sounds like an amalgam of Horkheimer and Habermas, believe it or not. Horkheimer’s conception of the administrative state was that human beings in advanced capitalist societies are not sovereign individuals with rights and lives of their own, but instead are commodities the state manipulates and administers. They are, in a very real sense, subjugated to the capitalist economic system.As for Habermas, he defines modern western society as a dyad of the system (capitalist labor), on the one hand, and the lifeworld (the realm of interactive communication), on the other. For him, this schema is normal and there’s nothing particularly bad about it. However, Habermas also argues that the system is “colonizing” the lifeworld, rationalizing and narrowing the sphere of interactive communication and subjecting it to the strictures of capitalism.Everything you say, Z-Man, accords with Horkheimer’s administrative state and Habermas’ system/lifeworld dichotomy.

        Following up on the analogy, white Americans are being laid off (i.e. fired).  The Board wants to take it in a new direction and will be looking to hire only POC and will be switching to Afro-inspired decor and elevator music.   We don’t even get a severance package; rather, management is cheering on the new hires to assault us as we are being led out of the building.  And to think how many of us and our families gave their lives to the corporation.

        Big Business might be a reflection of the current class structure. We might be seeing a political alliance of the upper and lower classes against the middle. In my younger days, big business made an effort not to offend anyone. Now Woke Capital is united in insulting half the country as reflected in its open support of BLM, a highly radical (not even liberal) group.Not even John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford were so brazen. They may have combated the unions and may have been paternalistic, but they came from the middle classes and never hated working people.Perhaps there is a mob psychology at work. The social circles in which top executives reside (e.g., the Hamptons, Malibu, the Upper East Side) are politically and socially homogeneous and might be heavily influenced by a radicalized academia through its recent hires, especially hard-core feminists. (Big business likes to hire young people.)Woke Capital may hate the Orange Man as a stereotype of a crass middle-class jerk, not so much his policies which actually favor Big Business (dissidents take note).

        The distinguishing characteristic of the America that emerged from the Cold War is that it is losing its regional variety in favor of a bland, corporate sameness.


I can remember attending a talk by the starchitect Rem Koolhaas in the mid-90s where he described researching this phenomenon among the major global cities.

        “If Steve wanted to be controversial, he would make that point (that the immigrants could complain about white privilage because Britain let them in)”.If Steve Baker made this controversial point he would be toast within months if not weeks. This observation of yours could only be made by someone who is out of politics, someone who can say what he wants because there’s fear of deselection, of instant opprobrium of the woke brigade, of being deprived of a public platform.In politics one cannot reveal what one plans to do when in power if the prevailing conditions are contrary to one’s plans. You can rabbit about controversy because you have no dogs in the fight.

        The media, corporations, the academy and the state are blending into one amorphous blob that sits over us like a dome. Everything is in the corporate state, nothing is outside it and nothing can be against it.Classical totalitarianism, then. The presence of corporations would indicate fascism, but the rest is classical Marxism. The grip will tighten as the Empire dissolves so much it is pointless to try to hang onto the constituent parts. You are right, the collapse probably is the least concerning part of the decline. What happens between now and then should focus the mind and people need to act like their lives depend on it because they in fact do. Wounded animals and so forth…

        I will be on the Killstream this WednesdayCan someone explain to me the appeal of Ethan Ralph?He has a face for radio, a voice for print and generally would look more at home holding Star Wars princesses on a leash. He is not a good interviewer, being neither insightful nor capable of letting his guests talk uninterrupted on his interminable daily streams.The key to his success, as far as I can discern, is his ability to book desirable guests while they’re hot.The reason for that, in turn, is that every one props up his show as some sort of authoritative forum, as though he himself were the Larry King of the Internet.The puzzling thing is that Ethan Ralph inhabits a particularly merciless corner of the Internet full of pugilistic autists. Yet even the most acerbic drama stirrers in that milieu not only steer clear of involving him in their food fights, they actively promote him. “I’ll be on the Killstream” is what every gossipy maladjusted sped with poor self control and aYouTubeaccount proudly announces when his car crash of an Internet career comes to a head.How did this boring, unstable, unpleasant alcoholic who sounds like a wheezing asthmatic with diabetes ever find himself at the top of that particular food chain?

                Among the zoomers I’ve met online, I’ve found many listen to the Killstream at least occasionally.That was quite a surprise as I assumed the whole marathon Hangout genre which peaked in 2017/2018 was primarily by millenials for millenials.Ethan Ralph’s listenership is probably less passionately political than, say, a Nick Fuentes’s, which may explain his broader appeal age-wise.

            Before Rush mainstreamed AM radio, they had all walks of life on AM.  Mostly local guys.  A lot of them weren’t all that good.  My guess is that dissidents on the internet are going through a similar evolution and there will be a weeding out process as it all becomes increasingly popular and more mainstream.

        Probably your best post in a while. Not a backhanded compliment; I read everyday and enjoy. But the corporate nature of the beast is something I have long mused on (and the fact that they are all different heads of the Hydra), and the way you then attached that to the political class was trenchant.
