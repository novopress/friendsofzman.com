        Satire as the new normal…
TED2015: Monica Lewinsky – The price of shamehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_8y0WLm78U
She considers herself “the first person to ever be publicly shamed on the Internet” and is now committed to helping those abused online.
Oh that damn cyber bullying and evil Internet, but not one bad word about Billy.
Karl Denninger wasn’t amused either,Oh Come On (Lewinsky).

        I think that the way the managerial elite will coopt the genetic revolution is twofold.
First, they define anything that is more than one SD from the mean as a disease or syndrome (this is already happening in psychiatry… shyness, sadness, misanthropy, propensity to violence, etc. all get medicated away).
Second, they start screwing with the genome to create the New Soviet Man that Lamarckian idiots Stalin and Lysenko failed to produce.  Now there’s your utopia.  We won’t regulate behavior.  We’ll encode it.
I doubt that they’ll succeed.  I am sure they will try.

        The types of folks who mock Christians about Galileo do not even know what the trial of Galileo was actually about
They THINK that they know, but actually don’t – it is always easier to feel strongly about what you want to believe is true when that makes you feel morally and intellectually superior
This makes it not just easier to mock Christians, but almost a requirement…

        Worth noting that Ted talks, by and large, are bite-sized chunks of information with powerpoint. They are designed and intended for the modern citizen of a busy-busy world who doesn’t have time to read a book or browse throughs several sources, layering the knowledge gained into a whole picture.Ted does it all for you. A little joke here, a little graph there, sprinkled with sincerity and a huge dollop of enthusiasm and the audience goes away, richly entertained.Actually it puts me in mind of Crowe’s character in ‘Gladiator,’ demanding to know if the crowd in the arena is not yet entertained by seeing death. Ted talks are like that: if the crowd in the open seats isn’t entertained they will tear the presenter apart later with all the ferocity of a social media lion.

            UKer, I have been pondering the bite sized format and thought about mentioning it. My suspicion is that a long presentation would require a level of detail that would open them up to the sort of scrutiny that would make them look foolish. The short version lets them present a passage from the catechism, a graph or two and let the audience fill in the blanks.

                A good presenter can hold anyone’s attention for 15-20 minutes. Add in some snazzy professional graphics and an “interesting” topic and you can pad it out to 30 minutes.People can only take in so much information and the presenter has to compete with all the other sensory input. I imagine it’s ten times worse today with cell phones.
