        The analogy to the left actions being a drug resistant virus is accurate. To extend that line of thinking, what are we told to do when prescribed Amoxicillin? Take all the pills, don’t quit when you start to feel better.
Run through these riots Soylent Green style. Then attack the treasonous and perfidious organizations until they are destroyed. Ruin people like Bass, Newsome, Soros , whoever is our enemy. It’s a war for survival now. Finish the antibiotic.

            Yeah, my main concern has been that like most responses and actions from what passes for the Right, this would be half-ass. I’m seeing an extremely well-coordinated program with an end goal in mind. Will it work? Maybe. But few are the times that answer would not have been “no.”

            “Then attack the treasonous and perfidious organizations until they are destroyed. Ruin people like Bass, Newsome, Soros…”This, and only this will work.  Work this situation as one works drug dealing in the street.  Hurl horrendous changes at the low level operatives in the street.  Do a “Jan 6” on them—no State charges—Fed only, no bail, no contact, no speedy trial.  Hold them until they give up their upper level organizers/bosses.  Arrest them as well and work your way back up the chain of command until you hit the top.What you reward you get more of, that’s a well understood “given”.  What seems not so well understood is that actions which you fail to punish, you get more of as well.  These low level rioters are expendable and their bosses know that.  Arresting them and only them is equivalent to squeezing a balloon—it will only expand elsewhere.  You need to pop it to make it go away.  There will never be a time where the nation is more supportive in these efforts than now.

                This.Eventually, you will reach a ceiling beyond which you will not be able to prosecute and imprison . . . Soros et al.  But in the process, you will have destroyed nearly ALL the NGO woke-fem organizations, and jailed for long terms everybody except the billionaire elite backers.And when it comes to the American women deeply embedded in these treasonous organizations, they have to be crushed too.  ‘Oh she’s just a girl’ time has passed for the neutered Right.  ‘Just a girl’ and her lackeys have been oppressing men and boys for 50 years, whilst thrilling to their empowerment.  That must end permanently.The Untouchables will be dealt with in due time, if I have to throw their evil asses into hell myself.  But right now we are fighting for the right to exist without persecution in our own nation.  That’s a big enough chunk to start.

                This, and only this will work.
Yes, but it’s only half of the equation. The other half is grassroots work – adult grassroots work, not dropping banners or screaming at people with bullhorns or larping as SA, but the hard, boring task of taking back the institutions from the ground up.
A handful of dedicated guys willing to work 15-20 hours a week, could coup most school boards in a few months.

                    The reasons the commies usually go Year Zero is the difficulty inherent in reform of existing systems.

                        It’s most likely because they already control the institutions, so they don’t care that waving placards and screaming into bullhorns and annoying random normies doesn’t actually work.If we dismantled the entire political superstructure we’d have to build ourselves a new one and if you ask me, it’d have to look pretty much like the old one, at least on the local level. I figure that taking them back and perhaps tweaking them a bit, is easier than building new ones.And never mind the minuscule political influence it gains you, the important bit is that there’s a lot of institutions (government and non) with a budget that you can use to give jobs, contracts and subsidies to your friends, or subvert the same way that the Sierra Club has been subverted into a pro-immigration org.The problem is that doing political community work is mind-explodingly boring, and it takes a lot of time, sitting through endless committee meeting, reading minutes and studying law codes, it eats up ressources that few people have.But ourguys have plenty of time for gay and narcissistic stuff like fitness and health and gardening and baking and lactofermenting and dieting and homesteading and a bigod cat videos, rather than making videos about how to coup your town council democratically or how to start your own political party or posting war stories from your local school board that you and your extremist pal got elected last year.

                            My gods, Krull. That’s how they did it. That’s exactly how they did it. That’s how they got so rich, so powerful, so connected.
They targeted .gov revenue streams and built out a support system.
That’s how they were able to stomach the endless hours on blithering bullshit. A white guy wants to make things work for their intended purpose, but a shithead just wants an “in”, like some internet scam.

            The best tool for the job, IMHO, is lawfare and rico charges against all the organizations behind all this bs.  Yes, criminal charges against the politicians publicly endorsing all the rioting and mayhem.
What they want, expect and are prepared for is sending in the national guard.  They would love a Kent State incident.  They would love viral videos of people getting effed up by the police or guard or military.  What they don’t want is lawfare against important people.

                Truly. We already have the tools to do it. The left showed us how. We just have to “J6” anyone and everyone that had anything to do with these riots. The biggest hurdle for this is getting normiecons not to care about the “hypocrisy” of it.

                    What hypocrisy?  “The left” started it.  Plus, these are criminal organizations which aid and abet criminal activity like rioting.
Con, Inc hates winning, so they may very well complain, but normal people want this to happen.   They are tired of these rent-a-mobs turning cities upside down on demand.  People are tired of antifa. People hate seeing Mexicans flying Mexican flags burning down the city.  There has never been a better time for lawfare.

                        Agreed.  Watched the CHP officer get hit in the head by a chunk of cement.    This is a real deal insurrection so as far as I am concerned the area where that projectile came from should have been liberally sprayed with some real bullets.

                            Unfortunately, that is what they want.  They could not care less about their pets other than when the FO portion of FAFO leads to ugly footage.  Then they parade the ugly footage, totally out of context and makes out the cops to be a fascist occupying force.  Then they get arrested and charged in a show trial meant to demoralize the cops and other forces of civilization.  Besides, there are 10k of that weirdo right behind him.What we need to do is get to the problem at the source.  The organizers and the financiers.  You cannot just shut them down. They need to go to prison for long periods and have all their assets seized.  FFS, we live in a country where cops literally rob people on the side of the road and in airports and other places all on behalf of the state.  If we can take 500 Dollars from D’Quan because they suspect the cash of being used in a crime, they can take the money from these criminal organizations.

                In a way, I hope the rioting spreads to Port-a-Potty (Portland). It would be lovely seeing the whole worthless gynocracy of Oregon rolled off to federal prison or Gitmo. Hell, lock up the whole OR state legislature too. Fuck ’em.
What the normies don’t realize is that our society underwent a very real revolution in the late 1960s that has been ongoing for decades. It needs to be rolledALLthe way back.

And yep, ALL of the Sickties Revolution destroyed or severely curtailed. I was wrong and got zoomed, like many others. But I see the light now.
Down with the fem agenda, the race agenda, and absolutely no more homo worship. No more pitting one element of society against another. The D.C. punks, intel, and corporate interests that continue to play this game of playing off hatreds = prison or execution. Enough.

He needs to put Sleepy Kash, Bongino and Blondie on two weeks notice of dismissal if they don’t get their backsides in gear on this.

                The reason you don’t put Patel and Blondie in high positions of authority is that their loyalty is divided, from the getgo. America is an Identity Nation now.
Patel will side with Indian invasion and Blondie will side with the feminists, as she is a feminist too. Like all women in power in the U.S.
Even after taking a bullet, Donald just does not get this. Or more likely, he doesn’t want to get it.  It’s a bridge too far psychologically for someone living in 1982.

You are so right. That b.s. requires an immediate response from the U.S. head of State, and that means Donald. A STFU should have been issued publicly to that little scumbag.

        If we put down the riots in L.A., fine. But the NGOs that pay for these pallets of bricks and their donors need to be prosecuted under RICO. You’d only have to prosecute one billionaire for donating to these termites for the rest to fall in line. Bill Gates has my nomination for the first billionaire to be frog-marched in an orange jumpsuit to prison.I remember in high school American history reading about the so-called “robber barons.” Sure, they were unethical and greedy, but at least some of them tried to do some good, like the Carnegie libraries.Our oligarchs’ contribution to society is chaos and disorder. Their perversion and evil is offensive.

                Another factor in this being speed is of the essence is that fact that by and large, the American public has pretty much had it with the uber-wealthy stirring the pot of shit and then hiding in their gated estates while average neighborhoods burn.Trot both Soros’ in front of a jury while explaining in detail how their money has been used to subvert the will of the voter, as well as being used to destroy their own country and watch both of those cretins get put away for long time.

                The entire Walton family, the board and everyone else involved in management in Walmart needs to be sent to a concentration camp and ALL of their assets seized. Walmart was instrumental in de-industrializing the US.Starting in the late 90s Walmart was forcing manufacturers in the US to relocate to China. “Your prices are too high. This is all we will pay and this is how you outsource your manufacturing to China”They also play all kinds of tax games. They literally argue in court that their buildings are so shoddily built they have negative value and are not subject to property taxes. Then, finally when they’ve bled a community of all they are worth, they shutter the store and leave it there for the municipality to clean up.

                    Before the evils of K-Mart and Wal-Mart, AMERICAN CITIZENS used to run sports, clothing, shoes, appliances and other businesses.That meant dad had a job, so HEALTHY families — not single-mother ‘families’ — could form and pass wealth to succeeding generations. Extended families were common in this setup.Then the corporations took over everything by undercutting the mom ‘n pop stores downtown, where we all used to shop — spend money. Then they finished-off the family business with their Scamdemic.Wal-Mart is pure evil. Destroys towns, makes family formation difficult or impossible, ships manufacturing to foreign and enemy countries. Wal-Mart is a disease within.Family net worth: $247 billion. Last I checked the Walton brood made more money than the bottom 30% of Americans combined. That is what Scripture calls ‘iniquity’ and it must be stamped out with combat boots on.

        The call for banning 3rd world immigration is clever. Sure, we all want a complete moratorium, but this is good optics, and it moves the window. Normies could be convinced that we can’t assimilate people from cultures too foreign to our own.
Of course, the key is designating India to be 3rd world.

                Agree. But the key is getting the ball rolling in the right direction. Once you get people accepting bans on immigration, it’s not hard to start including any and all countries.

                    You can ameliorate the situation by picking at it, rather than halting it completely.  For example, end “chain migration” under the guise of vetting all legal immigrants.  Vetting in this case meaning not automatically admitting relatives just because you got into the country legally in the past.  Another example is that we have a “lottery” where we admit 50k legal migrants per year simply “because”!  It’s only fair you know.
Lord knows how much shenanigans goes on behind the scenes in the legal immigration half of the problem.

                        You guys are way wrong on this chain migration thing. If you are going to admit somebody to be an American, then they have to get all the benefits of being an American, the biggest and most important benefit being having extended family around them. Extended family is an important social circle and helps integrate them into a brand new culture and society.Extended family also makes it less likely that they end up on the government dole. Countless businesses have been started and are sustained by having the family pitch in. You lose your job, you have somebody to go to to help you pay the mortgage until you can get a new one. You’re effectively an orphan without having family members around.

                            Total bullshit.You migrate based upon your own merit.  You prove you are an asset to this country.  You leave your past behind as far as this country is concerned.  You want to visit your relatives, fine.  You want to send them some money to help out, fine.  You want us to grant them full citizenship rights, because you are a citizen—bullshit.You want your wife and children to come in because you got citizenship…how about a non-citizenship continuing VISA for them?  That’s what they do everywhere else.  Example China, Japan, Korea…My father came here from Europe.  He became an American after a 5 year vetting process.  He met my mother here and married.  There was no sponsorship of his “relatives” for automatic entry.  We visited the “old country” every so often.  If he was so home sick, he was allowed to remigrate back to the “old country” and take his wealth with him (he didn’t).Really Nick, where the hell do you come up with this shit?

                                Not at all bullshit. You’ve got your parents, your kids, your siblings around you, and most people benefit from that. But you’re going to throw some guy who mops floors to the dogs without any family support system around them? And let’s not forget that this tears at the family fabric of this country. You’re going to bring in a bunch of loners with nobody around them to care about them or to care about. Is that the kind of society you want?At least when you bring your mom here, you have somebody to babysit the kids. You don’t have to go on government assistance to help you with your child care in a place where your kid is going to get molested.Chain migration is good. We just need to be selective of the people up front.

You can’t have it both ways. If you want the loners who aren’t family-oriented and have no support system, you’re going to get the border jumpers and people just come here for money. You seriously want loners in what has previously been a family country?

                                            Again, a gratuitous assertion without supporting evidence.  You’ve no idea how many “relatives” are imported under current “chain migration” law.  Are they all a part of the support structure you claim is needed?As I related, my father came here before all this nonsense and had no problem “adjusting” to the lack of relatives residing in close proximity.  And if this is a “deal killer” for the migration applicant, then let him live and thrive in his own country.  You also fail to address the alternative I suggested, that of continued residency without “citizenship” possibility for  immediate family (wife/children) only.Of course, an emotional argument is all you have here.  Vapid to the extreme.  However there is one benefit to your postings—all can see and note what a traitorous/disingenuous White sounds like and believes.

He likes to advise us Americans on all aspects of our lives, when he’s not busy calling us the biggest maroons on the planet and being bitter that Dad was “only” a union carpenter. He needs extra family members to bolster the argument.

He brought my uncle, my aunt, my grandmother. We also had cousins here, All fairly successful. That was great if for no other reason than to have somebody come to your funeral when you die.

One gratuitous assertion is validly refuted by another.
No, chain migration is not good!

                                    “You’ve got your parents, your kids, your siblings around you, and most people benefit from that.”This isn’t even true. 2% of Americans make an interstate move every freakin year.  We are as isolated as any alien.  Friends and family accessible by only telephone and email and such.“But you’re going to throw some guy who mops floors to the dogs without any family support system around them”They can always go home.  WTF is the point of moving out of your country to mop floors?  They are not just mopping floors because you really cannot support yourself mopping floors.  They have other grifts or criminal activity to support themselves.“Chain migration is good.”Let us know when we’re back to Western European immigrants only.A family of Mexicans is worse than a single Mexican and far better if ALL OF THEM are back safely in Mexico.

                                    Now you take first worlders (European Whites) and compare them to third worlders muds.  You also are clueless that most of this migration came before the revision of immigration law in 1965 which created “chain migration” and restricted most Whites from entering (while increasing third world entry),  thereby reducing a White counter balance to the chain migration of muds.

                        A moratorium is needed, but still not enough.  We need mass deportations and conditions to encourage self-deportation.
The authorities need to be imposing massive fines (and prison) for every single illegal alien they employ in any capacity unless they can prove they had a reasonable vetting process.  Large fines for renting an apartment to an illegal alien.
Why do I, an American citizen need 3 forms of ID to get a job and these illegal aliens don’t need of any of this?  It’s infuriating.

                            Fines mean nothing because the company pays the fine.  One needs to break the veil of corporate immunity is such cases and send offenders who make such decisions—and their superiors—to jail!  That will change the situation over night.  No different that breaking “qualified immunity” for police officers, which is now a growing trend.
There are many such examples outside of the Western world wrt to the above.  Say what you will about China, but a bullet in the head in front of a packed stadium for economic “crimes” always seems refreshing to me.  Quick and final.

                        I’ve got a good example for you: Melania Trump. She brought her parents and her sister over. Are you telling me that she shouldn’t have that support system around? That she should just sit all alone in her lonely penthouse with her autistic kid and with Trump living in separate quarters running around grabbing other women by the pcvssy? That her only connection to humanity should be the ugly family she married into?Ugly maybe strong to use against the Trumps, but I don’t get the warm and fuzzies with any of them. Imagine being all alone and stuck with all that around you. Anybody would go crazy.

                                My arguments are not feminized at all. I’m just a big believer in family and that includes extended family. I like having my people around me. “Friends” are a dime a dozen.We recently had a memorial lunch for my aunt. 75 people there. Family, extended family, friends, people we know from church. Or are you jealous that we have it and you don’t?In a different time and day, my aunt’s grandfather died in an industrial accident and is buried in Weirton, West Virginia. They didn’t even put a marker on his grave and the records burned in a cemetery fire so they don’t even know where his grave is. That was life then, thrown to the wolves.And nobody has answered my question on Melania. I guess she should just fend for herself, too? I guess she can go to some woman’s shelter if she gets tired of orange man grabbing other women’s pvssies?😆😆😆

                            Another fallacy of logical argument.  You take a case of “one” and extend it to all. Yes, even Trump’s wife should not be allowed to bring her family over.  It’s the good of the whole over the good of the few.
Again emotion drives you, not reason.  Emotional arguments fall on deaf ears here.  Grow up.

                            And that goes back to what I’m saying. If you’re selective up front, there’s nothing wrong with people bringing over their relatives to live a better life. You’re afraid that bringing your relatives over means we get flooded with third worlders. If you don’t bring those third worlders in the first place, there’s nothing to worry about.

                                You argue from a position that does not exist, nor is practical to implement.  Give it up.  But even if, you import only Whites, you still have to have a vetting process for such a race.  Half the Whites in this country are on the left side of the Bell Curve.   Those in the bottom are worthless as well.  Just because they have a relative here—who indeed thrives—means nothing.

                            It’s really very simple. We can’t properly employ and educate the people we have. We should not be importing any more. The best prospects for immigration are white Europeans but they are needed badly in their own countries.

                            That’s fine.  The conundrum sets in when you assume a country with an average IQ of 83 is on par with others of such ilk.  Then it becomes difficult to address the observation of a country that has designed and produced its own jet fighter, has nukes, etc, etc.

There’s no religious angle to shill for poopoo pagans as being just like us &amp; jeets are so aggressively insufferable &amp;  brazenly tribal it makes a much stronger case for immigration reform for normies.

                        “clever”I did not claim they were clever, I do not believe they are clever &amp; I’m not seeing how its better to have a much less hated brown race around in the country or how the fact they can’t all be removed makes that argument self evidently true on its face.My counter to that implication is jews who are able to blend in very well with Whites. On a scale of racial camouflage via perceived similarities, setting aside White liberals, jews are arguably the most concealed &amp; jeets are on the complete opposite end of that spectrum in every conceivable way.It seems to me you’re implicitly arguing that higher racial concealment is better. I don’t know how else to take what you said so that’s what I’m responding to just to be clear.I prefer my racial enemies to be as visible &amp; openly unpleasant as possible because it makes friend/enemy distinction easier &amp; thus subversion harder by equal measure. So I disagree, I see no upside &amp; even prefer they stay in their own ghettos if they’re going to be around rather than blur the lines &amp; intermix with Whites in every way imaginable the way so many spics do.

            The call to ban Third World migration was the logical next step after the totally symbolic grant of citizenship to white South Africans. I’m quite impressed as to how all of this has been carefully coordinated since the first day.

                Yeah, the fact that a bunch of recently converted DR influencers (Walsh, Kirk, etc.) called for it all at once says something is going on behind the scenes. Regardless, this is a very good step in the right direction.
It’s not a huge leap from banning 3rd world immigration to all immigration or putting any country – India – on the banned list.

                    Your concern about the Subcons is fully justified. The upper castes are highly intelligent. And we’ve seen the destruction a smart minority can cause.
I don’t know if this is leading to a full moratorium but it would not surprise me. Whatever the end game, this is shockingly coordinated for something from the putative Right.

The essence of the problem is not simply being a “smart minority”, it’s being a smart and “ethnocentric” minority.  That’s the problem we (Whites) have.  We are not ethnocentric enough to promote our own interests in this multiracial society.

                            This discussion has me thinking. I can’t speak to the lack (or not) of ethnocentricity of Europeans, but as for Americans, there’s the idea of leaving and starting over and nation building. We lack ethnocentricity because we’re building our ethnicity.Hence the hoopla about our Constitution— the law binds us together until we build stronger bonds.The process has been undermined, lately even demonized— those satanic Americans!(Undermined from the beginning by the presence of African slaves imo.)I’m over it. In the long run, I expect this to be a major transition point along the way to the American nation. But that will take honesty about what we’re working on

                                Well, as for me, I’m not interested in building a new ethnicity. If your ancestors weren’t northwest Europeans you’re alien to me.
Sorry, those of you who hail from Mediterranean or Slavic stock. Your behavior is infinitely more tolerable than the third worlders’ but I’ve never felt much kinship with you either. That’s just the way it is.
The “melting pot” never was.

                                    Well then I’m not alien lol. But we aren’t NW Europeans. Drop me over there,I’m sure it feels familiar, but I’m sure it wouldn’t feel like home. I mean, part of the cause of revolution was the colonists coming to see themselves as Americans instead of British subjects. Just kind of happens with time and distance.

                                        It certainly wouldn’t feel like home now, since they’ve had a similar immigration problem which has ruined just about everything which made it what it once was.

                                        You mean Russian?Look, I didn’t say the Mediterraneans and Slavics have to go anywhere.I get along with them just fine, and even admire them in many ways. We have a live and let live attitude toward each other that I find perfectly acceptable.  I just don’t resonate with them as much as I do with people with similar ancestry as my own.They’re distant relations at best and finding common ground with them requires abstracting away from each of our traditional cultures.  Less so than with blacks, Asians, or Indians from Mexico, of course, but I’d rather not do it all — especially since Germanic heritage is particularly under attack in today’s world.

                            Holy shit. If you study deep Jewish tenet, they believe they are spiritual aliens from a higher plane, colonizers and lightbringers trapped in the gross, feminine, organic material plane where reproduction is by the inferior, painful, messy process of giving birth- thus the hatred of women.
Combine that with the embedded rage at Aryan superiority, wherein the only way to harvest the power of Eve’s people is to take that bitch Eve as a sex slave…no wonder the “righteous” feel this world is a Hell to be “fixed”.

            Correct. “Developing world” was a 20th century term. All of the countries thatcoulddevelophavedeveloped. You could have called Korea or Singapore thedevelopingworld credibly. Guess what? They’re 1st world countries now and behavior that is commonplace in India are not tolerated there. Singapore disciplines you forspittingin the street, much lessshi….you get the idea. Nobody should look at India and think it’s 1st world. They’ve had well over half a century to make the jump from 3rd world backwater to 1st world (something other nations did over the course of a handful of decades). Their skyscrapers were all built by Koreans. They’re militarily incapable of contesting Pakistan, which no sane person would ever describe as anything other than 3rd world. Their primary export is undesirable people (the hallmark of a 3rd world country). Tell everybody you meet about the designated defecation streets in India. It goes a long way.

                Meanwhile, once you get past the Yaqui savages in Baja (the Aztecs couldn’t either), you have ultra-modern hospitals, refineries, skyscrapers, and highways along with ancient archaeology right in downtown Mexico City. Mexico is not that far a cry away from being brown Europe.
What’s missing in Mexico (and Europe) is the same thing missing here: a death penalty.

                    Mexico is not so different from other hispanic countries. Where negros have a talented tenth, for hispanics it’s more like a talented third. This supports a lot of good things. But that other 2/3 also exists, and always will, like their huge, sprawling slums.

                The Indians’ military procurement system is byzantine, to put it mildly. When they were buying new fighter planes, one of the competitors went out of production waiting for these bureaucrats to make up their minds.And they have a weird mixture of Russian, British and French aircraft (with a few of our transports and patrol planes sprinkled in for fun) that make maintaining their fleet a logistical nightmare.They also have delusions of grandeur when it comes to their aircraft industry. Their indigenous fighter aircraft needed LOTS of U.S. engineers to check and rewrite the control laws for the fly-by-wire system. The aircraft would’ve been a disaster if it even made it into the air without our help.The Pakistanis have an indigenous fighter aircraft that was mainly designed by the Chinese and simply assembled in Pakistan. It’s a far better airframe than the  HAL Tejas and has actually been exported to other countries. The Tejas is a bit of a white elephant.

That’s not what we are getting with these illegals. We’re getting the not so attractive non-european stock. You would think that Hollywood would be sensitive to the uglification of America because it directly impacts whether that industry gets to thrive or not.
Filling this country with ugly women will result in Hollywood going down the tubes.

                Hollywood is circling the drain for the most part. “Hollywood” as a term actually is archaic. For the most part, creatives have been leaving right along with everyone else, entire sectors of the film industry are no longer in California, and there is vastly diminished demand for the product.

                    Due to union laws, almost nobody is filming in the lots anymore. I was watching an interview with Jim Agnew and other industry types talking about how Hollywood is turning into Detroit. You have to pay union people to be present for anything. Canada has always had generous grants to film there (ever wonder why 97% of every planet SG1 ever visited looked like British Columbia) and other areas are picking this up. People mentioned it’s cheaper to fly everybody and everything out to Ireland and film there rather than use closed sound stages in Burbank. Good riddance. I just wish the Hollywood mindset would die with the location. Indie video games and music have been annihilating their “AAA” competitors, but indie films (if they’re not simple low-budget affairs) are difficult to make. You’re not going to get a great action film with car chases and explosions without decent funding, whether it’s practical effects or CGI. AI might change some of that with CGI.

                I was watching a little bit of Telemundo a few weeks ago. I don’t understand a thing they say, but I was captivated by all the good looking women on the screen.I’ve been living in Argentina for 21 years (not exactly Telemundo-land, but Spanish-speaking) and those women aren’t just on the screen: they’re everywhere. My son (now also my neighbor) married one, a just-turned-23 biochem grad who’d been the leader of acarnavalsamba team that’s perhaps the best-known in the country. She’s a mix of Spanish, Arab and Guaraní from a working-class background, but nobody’s fool. Promptly popped out three grandchildren, little gringos all and I sit on the front porch watchin’ with a grin of serene content.

                What you’ve noted is the “sexism” and “patriarchy” of the South American culture. For as long as I can remember we’ve been regaled about our Southern “brothers” lack of wokeness, which is reflected in their culture. i.e., treatment of women. 😉
I find such refreshing. Hell, there are even “news” programs where the “weather babe” strips. Here we have predominantly women as weather reporters, but pretend they are there for their superior “knowledge” rather than “eye candy”, but whichever, it seems they are never plain and ugly.

                Univision and Telemundo only put hot looking women of mostly European stock on the air. No way would they ever put someone of indigenous stock on the air. Same for their soap operas, known as novelas. You have to look very hard to find anyone that is ugly. For some reason, American TV commercials have forgotten that and are racing to find some of the most repulsive people in our nation.

        In the Twitter show ZMan mentions at the beginning of today’s post, they talk about an incident in Omaha where more than 100 illegals were arrested at a meat processing plant. When are we also going to arrest, jail and execute the ones who hired those illegals?

        One thing that has helped our side is two things that were present in 2020 aren’t present now:1) The hysterical lockdowns over COVID2) Twitter is now X, and is uninterested in “un-personing” people with non-Leftist viewpoints.People on X have reminded users the same Governor Hairgel that is decrying the Heavy Hand of Government enforcing laws in California put draconian laws in place around COVID enforcement and used the Heavy Hand of (State) Government to do things like arrest people surfing, paddleboarding, or just walking alone along the beach in CA. They also did astoundingly stupid things like filling in skate parks with tons of sand so they couldn’t be used.Further, with the addition of Community Notes X serves as a counter to the “Baghdad Bob-ism” of mainstream media who are trying the “Mostly Peaceful” angle on demonstrations. X users are countering the MSM’s dissimulation, in the style of cheaters being caught in flagrante delicto, of asking their viewers about X posts “Who you gonna believe, me or your lyin’ eyes Baby?”Frankly, as has been mentioned here repeatedly, I don’t know if it will “move the needle” for the great bulk of “normals”, but it could be a start.

            Relatedly, people have tuned out the old-school propaganda organs, even if they do not use social media. Also, people under 40 realize there are no laws or justice outside of raw power at this point. I’ve never thought shy of economic collapse there would be a serious challenge to the system but that is not a given now.

        This can boomerang very fast on the Blobules. They themselves are — or at least, once were — familiar with human psychology. The same emotional dynamics that have led many Whites for the past 30-40-50 years to view themselves as somehow immoral — and others moral — are extremely fluid and subject to reversal at the drop of a hat (or flag). These are highly volatile, emotional, irrational people, looking for enemies to blame for perceived sins.For a long time, that impulse has been directed inward. The problem the Blob might have going forward is that fewer and fewer people have complex inner lives, which is the only entrance to the psychological path down the Stations of the Cross of guilt, shame, and self-recrimination, especially if one comes from a Christian background. These simpler types are less likely to accept accusations of ancestral abuses in order to extract something from them in the present, and to sacrifice something material as recompense for an abstruse and immaterial moral harm they themselves did not commit. After all, they too want to consume, and paying reparations and placing 10,000 foreigners in front of them in the line for a job will dawn on them as manifestly “unfair” (the word they are most likely to reach for), and an obstacle to the life being offered to them on social media and the “influencers” of their generation.Moreover, at some point, even the sinner recognizes that they have done their penance, and begins to ask,what else am I supposed to do? And it is at that point that they realize they are being manipulated against their own self-interests, and their inner emotional turmoil — which they believe they have addressed, seventy times seven — then begins to be projected outward. I suppose one can find examples of this in the 20th century.

            Well done. I expect the Blobules to use raw force and violence if/when they realize their dominance is slipping. As you write, they are estrogen-drenched shipwrecks and cannot help but lash out. I actually think that will provide a pretext to go after them and it will happen. How will that turn out? Dunno. But what is being done to them is well-choreographed–shockingly so–and every time they get back on their feet they get knocked back down. It is pleasantly surprising. Just as younger whites are inherently opposed to Zion, they also realize only raw force works and rules and laws are a joke.

            I’ve said it before: one of the worst mistakes the blob ever made was messing with the “bread and circuses.” There are a lot of funny memes that correctly point to the fact that one of the key elements of the 2016 Trump campaign was its online presence and one of the key elements behind the online presence was “gamergate” where white men were enraged at the amount of social justice warrior manipulation in the gaming industry. Entertainment has continued to get worse. People no longer have a fantasy world to escape to and are forced to live in the grim reality. Fast food is now prohibitively expensive for most people (they shouldn’t be eating it anyways, but cheap slop and beer are the “bread” in the B&amp;C component). If the blob was competent in any way, they would have locked the DEI crowd out of entertainment and subsidized slop so it stayed cheap.

                Very sharp. The Woke-Fem Politburo always oversteps, because it is a feature of their pseudo-religious zealotry.
And the Woke-Fem Politburo relies on brute force (LE and the courts) and the bullying of all opposition. GamerGate was a perfect example: they assumed they would overrun the opposition and simply take whatever they wanted, as they’ve done with all other institutions.
But the ‘incels’ (the gynarchy loves that derogation) stood their ground and resisted the Borg. The only ones who have done so successfully so far.

        This latest “revolution” looks like weak sauce to me. Not impressed. Media hysteria tries but fails to elevate it to the level of past civil unrest in AINO. Maybe we will get a fake crackdown to put down the fake revolution, all for the optics.Because it just doesn’t stir up the negros. Sure they will go for some free nikes when the opportunity presents, but for the most part this isn’t their show. They don’t like the flood of mestizos any better than anyone else. And the mestizos themselves, for the most part, are not all that interested in raising hell. Meanwhile the baizuo will hold their meaningless  “no kings” parades on the weekends and nobody will care. But it gives them something to do.The Zman didn’t mention the hand of Sheinbaum/cartels (same thing) in all of this. Or how the Trump admin will respond to that. I don’t know how they will. But they should.

            I listened to Auron MacIntyre’s podcast on this, and he pointed out that with the blacks sitting this one out, the Dems don’t get the holy blessing of their (2nd most) chosen people. As has often been pointed out, blacks and Hispanics have a lot of animosity. Illegal immigration hurts working class blacks first and foremost. Hispanics have pushed blacks out of many neighborhoods. The rise of Hispanics in the Dem coalition means a decreased status of blacks. Black leaders can see all this. They’re not going to go and march for their own political disenfranchisement. Of course, conservatives can’t see this because they need to pretend to be color blind. But Steve Sailer is right, this Dem coalition only holds together when everyone is targeting White people. You can’t paint this ridiculous protest as anything more than an unassimilated group of foreigners who do not want to live under this nation’s laws.

                They specifically brought up Compton (or La Compa as it may as well be renamed). It’s been a talking point since at least 2013 that the Mecca of West Coast rap has turned into mariachi-land. We truly are watching the dogs fight over the scraps of our civilization. Unfortunately for blacks, Hispanics are slightly smarter and far more organized and don’t have any of the political handicaps that whites do. One needn’t wonder how blacks would have fared against the Comanches. You’re watching it in most major cities. The good news is that we know heritage Americans are capable of beating both the Indios (the plains wars) and the Mexicans (Texas Independence, Mexican American War) with relative ease if there’s political will to do so. The grandstanding of militant blacks that they could win a war against whites is comical considering they can’t even beat Hispanics.

                As has often been pointed out, blacks and Hispanics have a lot of animosity.Keeping an eye on the news in Chicago from last year, the blacks in Chicago absolutely HATED having Mayor Conehead (Brandon Johnson) declare Chicago a “Sanctuary City”. This meant he settled plenty of border jumpers in traditionally black neighborhoods. I read and watched summaries of community meetings and the way black Chicagoans talked, you’d have thought it was a bunch of white Chicagoans from the 1960s or 70s (“These people come here and they bring crime and cause trouble! They don’t respect our community and their values are different than ours. They hang out and harass us!”).Of course, the main complaint was the immvaders were taking money that was rightfullytheirs.(Ol Brandon was pretty generous with The Gibs)So no, I don’t see blacks crying crocodile tears over Hispanics being deported.

        ‘On the other hand, the Blob people are relentless. Like a drug-resistant virus, they must be completely eradicated to make sure they do not return’Yessir.

And I am pleased if this is you presenting the ‘moderate man’ position.‘For example, whenever you see college aged white girls with whistles at one of these things, you know the army of not-for-profits has their people on the ground training protestors’As I’ve commented previously, hitting USAID was barely a beginning in eradicating the NGO Woke-Fem networks.But there was no follow-up from Le ‘Orange. You can’t take out one company or battalion and then expect you’ve won the war.Like most of America’s other problems, the Invader Issue will never be addressed as long as White Princesses with Whistles command the moral and ethical high ground of your nation . . . and call the shots on the streets and in the courtrooms. Everywhere, really.You must pulverize and disempower permanently the feral and predatory White Grrls who organize and lead all of these traitorous events and policies. The college-educated white chicks who have been waging war against Traditional America and Traditional Americans for a century now.Does Donald Trump have the stones for that? No. It’d be like imprisoning his own dotters. Donald is a yesterday man.You best find somebody with the stones for it while you still have a nation.

            Trump is implementing a plan that has been crafted for him by others. The stones are on those who created it. I don’t know what the end game is, mind you, but so far so good.

                I don’t even know if Trump is implementing the plan. I say he’s more of a non-executive chairman of the board. Trump and all of his appointees are just placeholders, actors for TV. Others are doing the real work. That’s what I have thought for a long time anyway.
It really is fascinating. This truly has the hallmarks of being a revolution. In a way, an Orange Revolution, except this time favorable to our interests. Too bad I’ll be dead before they do an Argo-style movie about it.

                    Elected officials basically have no power at all as it is. But Trump is acting as a front man willingly here, which may be the worst nightmares of those in the Regime who tried to murder him. I like “Orange Revolution,” by the way, and will use it. This certainly is not a reaction as is what happens always with what passes for the Right here.

                        I really think it’s Steve Pieczenik and that crowd pulling the strings here. The movie Argo kind of touches at the edges of what’s going on here, that is what I have believed for a long time. I think just like they used Hollywood to pull the wool over the eyes of the government of Iran, they are using Hollywood to put their plan in effect.They are really doing the same thing that the subversives have done in the past, except what they are putting in place has popular support.I still go back to 2015, that was before Trump became president. Somebody held a gun to Google’s head to force them to change their name to Alphabet. (As in alphabet agencies.) Big corporations have no sense of humor. They would not be poking fun at themselves in that manner unless they were forced to.Likewise when Zero had to exit the back of the plane in China. I think we were under some form of military government and that was their way of sending a message that Zero had been removed.I wouldn’t bet my life on any of this, but countries like China don’t do such things to foreign leaders. Especially not to the President of the United States. Zero would not have been humiliated like that unless China was acting on a request by whoever was in power at the time.Those are kind of my thoughts on what is going on, but we shall see.

                I see little evidence yet of stones. A raid on USAID and some rubber bullets at the latest Leftie riot barely scratches the surface.
If the NGOs are broken and their (white, female) bosses are imprisoned, that qualifies. Arrest Bass, Newscum, Maxine Waters, Pelosi and associated domestic insurgents, that definitely qualifies.
Send monitors to every U.S. college accepting federal funds, and indict every person who continues to push gender and race quotas — qualifies.
What’s transpired so far is in the right direction but . . . does not qualify.

                    I agree the NGO’s have to be destroyed root and branch. If I were doing this sequentially, it would be via the courts* and taxing authorities after they fly their freak flags. It seems, anyhow, to be moving in that direction. Based on my limited information, this is playing out that way. I’m happy so far.
*There are judges in some jurisdictions who would do this; the Left has dominance but not a complete monopoly.

                        Makes sense. I’d start with the NGOs and the colleges. The colleges manufacture the Woke and the Feminists, while the NGOs put into practice the satanic ideology they have learned.After that, move to the primary and secondary schools. Break the two major teachers’ unions, fire Ms. Teach by the millions, place (vetted) men in supervisory positions over ALL the public schools.The students must be de-programmed first, and I already know for a fact that millions of boys and young men would LOVE to purge the schools of the organized and official hatred of masculinity, whiteness and Christianity.The grrls?  They like things as they are.It can be done. Just takes wanna and some guts.

                The Civil Rights Regime IS the Regime. That IS the Borg, the Establishment.  It must all be annihilated and soon.If you could visit major ‘family law’ (divorce) firms in the big cities of the nation, and discover the horrific, fat, screeching harpies that run those firms, you’d know why entering a ‘family law’ hearing is ruinous for males.Many of these sows have become mega-millionaires during the past 50 years of Rape the Male. Many courts now — civil and criminal included — openly practice ‘feminist jurisprudence’. Guess what happens if you are a man in their courtrooms?The shit I could tell you, wow. The Divorce Industry in Amerika is fully feminist, and fully malevolent. It is an alliance between women and the courts, a hugely remunerative alliance. LE is part of it too, the cowardly little fuckers.The Divorce Industry is demonic. It needs to be wiped out in total, period.

        The entire zeitgeist has changed since the last riot season, as well as the BOM’s subordinates. This smells like a desperate throw of the dice in a war the Left is losing, knows it is losing, but can’t do anything else. Deploying (not “mobilizing”) the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines (2/7) is a warning and a message to the political and judicial class. I think he’s hoping that some district Federal judge tries to order that he cannot deploy Marines as Commander in Chief to LA. He makes an example of LA and California, the beating heart of our enemies, or he is finished, and I think he knows it, or JD Vance and Pistol Pete Hegseth will tell him, because those two are unlike the Vichy worms he had in his first administration in Pence and “Lap Dog” Mattis.

            I’ve thought the same about an attempt to provoke judicial overreach. A federal judge yesterday apparently was on the same page although that was just an early attempt to control the military from the bench. Given what we’ve seen, such a ruling is anticipated and probably welcomed.Bear in mind the Left suffers Victory Disease. They have not been seriously challenged in 80 years, and arguably twice that long. Their Achilles Heel always has been impulsivity, a feminine, estrogen-drenched hysteria when opposed, and it leads them to do stupid shit. Someone has coordinated and carefully crafted a brilliant challenge to the Old Regime and it anticipates this combination of complacency and impulsivity. I don’t know how it pans out, but it is shocking that what passes for the Right has brought a gun to a knife fight for once.Also, bear in mind this is the whole ball of wax. That makes the outcome existential for both factions.

        It will only be days before a random district judge rules that Trump can’t actually enforce any further immigration laws and blocks the insurrection act before it begins. This will come down to, yet again, whether Trump has the balls to start ignoring the courts and just start exercising raw executive power. His record to date suggests he will back down once told he can’t actually do presidential things because some immigrant judge tells him no.

        The question is whether the Trump Administration will take full advantage of the opportunities this failed sequel presents. My guess is they will, actually. I’m not totally convinced the oligarchs are primarily concerned about the empty cubicles, but there is no profit now in the mayhem and disorder, quite the opposite. Some of the Clouds’ advisors have taken out their calculators and realized–perhaps too late–that more than the Dirts would have to be strip-mined to finance the savages.A couple of related random thoughts on a few municipalities:Chicago will prove to be the killing ground. It is La Raza Central ruled by Negroes and is likely to devolve quickly into intra-ethnic savagery. Muh Holy Negro will be more on the receiving end than the White Devil. It will be a fight over who gets to rape any white girls with whistles in the inner city, among other things.D.C., the center of the Blob, also will have to be pacified later this summer. The political clowns will be forced to take kinetic action on their own turf after a point.Rioting in NYC will decide the upcoming mayoral race there. If Cuomo loses, and he very well may, the city will become Detroit East.

        Once the Biden people made an app that brought in multitudes of people on just the press of a button on a phone, that signaled the end of any legitimate immigration “process”.  There is effectively no difference between illegal and legal immigration and it all must be ended.

        Well, we all knew that dismantling USAID was not going to be enough and they were going to find the money. Also, in hindsight, it seems like the media was egging on Trump by reporting on his low deportation numbers, trying to walk him into a trap. But then I saw CNN whining about how Trump’s favorability is skyrocketing right now, people aren’t ready to join in on another color revolution. We want these people out of the country, even normie Democrats.The revolutionaries might have overplayed thier hand. It doesn’t mean they are going to stop, of course, but unlike their 8 year buildup into the Summer of Floyd (where the groundwork was being laid in 2012), they rushed into this after the whole of America spent four years getting disgusted by what Mayorkas was bringing into this country.

        I’ve got a theory. Many people expected a lot of this color revolution stuff to die on the vine as USAID was gutted and the NGOs who received funding through this and went on to organize these clandestine actions as part of the marriage between elite bureaucratic and elite financial interests ran out. I was never that optimistic. Where’s the money coming from? I think it’s Europe. Their NGOs are still standing, even if they are used to receiving American tax dollarsGuys like Tom Luongo and Stormy Waters have pinpointed that the success of the European Elites relies on America First failing. They postulate that Europe is facing a sovereign debt default that will make Greece’s austerity in the 2000’s look like the roaring 20’s. The only way out was for Europe to siphon off heroic levels of capital from the US. Ursula von der Leyen (a criminal who happens to be president of the European Commission) has been at war with Jerome Powell over monetary policy for years. His predecessor, Yellen, had been giving Europe money hand over fist through interest rates and other policies. Europe needs to kill America First to resume business as usual. I’m willing to bet they’ve stepped up to continue funding the destabilizing organizations in the US to do what they do best. People will focus on the Walton family lending their support to the upcoming “No Kings” riots (a phrase they’ve been A-B testing since January on reddit and other places) or the gefilte-fish-taco-eating Mexican Gringotts goblina encouraging civil unrest across the US, but they’re small players and too inexperienced at these things. The most obvious answer is that the usual suspects are up to the usual mischief with some unusual funding. The blob abides.

            Europe’s money (for things like this) comes from us.Nobody likes this idea, but it explains some odd things, not least the bottomless budget and Republican politicians’ kowtowing (only Trump, out of the loop, dissents): Antifaet al.are a black branch of the US military.American antifa was started by a guy I know. Not a friend, obviously, but he was around. His freedom from concern, in every sense, caused some suspicion. The fantasycope, when needed, was that he was rogue intelligence, misspending his allowance to stick it to the man.Good cop.We should know by now, there’s no such thing.And nobody checked. Youcan’t, but nobody did. If you “followed the money,” the trail ended at this one guy.If you follow the money today, you get to Soros, some other Jews, unions’ political groups, the usual. You learn nothing.So instead, follow the chain ofobedience. Whosaysantifa can do what it does? Who says it’s an “idea” that can’t be resisted? Who says the enemy isyou?Commandsays.

        What the Trump admin needs to do is pursue RICO cases against all of the organization and finance behind antifa and la raza and any other organizations it can find including all of the “socialist” organizations and universities involved.
Decades in fed prison for the people and confiscation of all the assets of these orgs. These are nothing but criminal organizations. The morons on the front lines in the streets are easily replaced, but the money and the organizations are much more vulnerable to lawfare and much harder to replace.

        Let’s say Aztlan happens- that a Mexican or Latino government takes California and the Southwest. Kind of like Eastern Ukraine.
It will still have laws, and government; it may or may not be overly favorable to white people, even though Mexico has plenty of very light skinned folk.
One thing I’m willing to bet on is this: that it will in no way be as outright hostile to white people as our own govenment is.
Good grief.  What if Aztlan ends up being where white refugees go?

            Whites and blacks are weirdly over-represented in California government circles. While the cops are mostly Latino. For example, Bass is not representative of of the city of LA’s demographics, and if NWA made a re-union album with surviving members it would be “Chased outta Compton.”Which brings the puzzling relative quite of Adam Schiff (the embodiment of Classy Freddy Blassie’s “Pencil Neck Geek”) and Alex Padilla, the two Senators, and putative candidate for Governor Katie Porker. As well as Kamala Harris. In normal circumstances its a severe hazard, the most dangerous place to be, between a politician and a news camera. Yet these people have been invisible or said the minimal. Meanwhile Bass and Newsom have several news conferences a day, as the leaders of the “Resistance.”So there seems to a be a split in California’s pols on the utility of fighting Trump for criminal illegals. Politics in California (inter-party that is) is brutal and those who lose like Villaraigosa, tend to lose big. Not much soft landing for them. Those who survive the Darwinistic struggle tend to be cruel, vicious, clever, and opportunistic. Note Harris to the best of my knowledge despite the Murdochs and the WSJ pouring money and publicity into her public relations efforts has said nothing. Some fear Steiner and the District Court Judges may not be coming.

            Let me add my take on what is up with Mexicans in California, since I was born and raised here though spent time in other places. The majority of my life I have lived here.There is a separate, Mexican Spanish Universe for Mexicans in the US. It exists for those who migrated here as adults or near adults. Separate TV stations, radio stations, musical acts, comedians, lawyers, doctors, insurance companies, and more. A Mexican man can live his whole life here never speaking English and having what amounts to exported Mexico here. To a lesser extent, this is true of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. For whatever reason, I have never met a Costa Rican here in California, though I have elsewhere in the US.In this regard it is similar to the situation Louis Armstrong wrote about in his autobiography regarding blacks and Whites in New Orleans before desegregation. A black and White man can occupy the same streetcar, sidewalk, etc. but never ever acknowledge each other or even occupy the same social and mental universe. The same is true for Mexicans and other groups in Los Angeles and the greater metro area. For example, there are videos on YT entirely in Spanish, of Mexican guys in their Jeeps and other four wheelers going up some canyon in the snow (freak snow went fairly low).Mexicans are fairly left wing, they are not woke. They love big trucks, jeeps, barbecues, big lawns, etc. In that they are fairly red neck. Again, just my own personal observations make of it what you will.

        Great way to tie in yesterday’s post with today’s. A bunch of the smart people are smart enough to know, that the great singular genius meme is a myth. Elon isn’t designing and building these things. He could go away tomorrow and the talent and capital would still be there. Moreover, maybe somebody who is sane would direct those resources with far lower time preference and a real civilizational outlook. Of course, we have that type of world described for us by Guillame Faye who called it Archeofuturism. He didn’t flush it out enough, but the gist is there.These oligarchs are not the uber-mensch their fancy PR machines make them out to be. In fact, the megalomania and hype machines got their wealth far out over their skies and most of it accumulated from the future or by transferring from the analog world to the digital with arguably no real efficiency gain and ignoring the social costs.In other words, you took to get. This mob over here is calling for you. We played by the rules and then got shut out by DIE that you gleefully adopted. Coder jobs forever except for white men who can go suck it. Now there are no coder jobs forever, and that turned on a dime. All of their concern and humanitarian horse manure has turned out to be a gigantic lie. Then there is Karp – such a blatant psychopath. And again, the question smart people intuitively are answering is: Who needs you?We played by your rules but got played by you. LA and the flash looting of the past few years also gave us a glimpse of the efficacy of bots. The automated checkout counter is a joke. The Waymo car was a sitting duck. That isn’t to say that their tech can’t be formidable. But it can be sabotaged and the entire panoptican is dependent upon compliance – people being afraid of reputational damage and ostracization. But when you have nothing left to lose tens of millions of high agency smart people will just say, “I smile at your camera as I come for you. I played by the rules while you financially and spiritually supported an invasion of my lands and their conquest by a rabble of barely stone age hooligans.”A Merchant run order is not an order. It is a road to ruin. Ironically, the open society is just a lion laying down on his back to the jackals. It is easily gamed by the trickster. Well, now everyone can see, the rules were not rules but the erasure of rules. Given that, the people who always respected and honored the rules that were bent against them are starting to wonder if they should respect them at all.

        Trump is lucky in that his enemies are inept. The Left Blob challenged him on issues – immigration/border, law/order – for which he has the most public support. Meanwhile, the ICE raids are ideal for Oligarchs – they keep their cheap labor meek and vulnerable while taking some pressure off strained state/local budgets. Oligarchs should be leaning into them while quietly thwarting e-Verify for employers and National ID etc. Instead they play into Trump’s strong hand. But this is just a warm-up for the real battle ahead, which Zman foreshadows, over AI. When AI replaces cubicle HR cat ladies and IT jeets, we’re going to see the Catfood and Curry Revolution.

                            The ones he took on had gotten a stranglehold of essential elements of a strong centralized government and in essence held assets which rightfully belonged to the people.  For example, natural resources like oil and gas.
That he allowed some business gurus like the oligarch who owns Sky vodka seems secondary to the issue.
But yes, he does have friction with those types from time to time, but I’m not sure they play a significant role in his guidance of a strong Russian State.

                The 401k thing is actually more important than people give credit to. Who’s the largest wealth-management firm? Vanguard. Who owns a controlling interest in Vanguard? Blackrock. Who owns a controlling interest in Blackrock? Vanguard. Your 401k has been used, much like tax dollars in USAID, to destabilize Western countries. If we had a sane world, there would be massive class-action lawsuits against these investment firms as they’ve used their board positions to advocate for insane money-losing “go woke go broke” positions in firms. Your 401k has lost money as a result of Vanguard et. all showing up to shareholder meetings and demanding that She-Hulk get greenlit. That’s a clear violation of their fiduciary duty to their investors i.e. you. There’s no way to deal with these parasites without demolishing the current retirement investment apparatus. 404k: retirement funds not found.

Wipe Vanguard and Blackrock off the board. Shutter their offices. They are anti-God, anti-American insurgents no different than rioting mestizos or pussy parade shrews.
Jail their executives. Liquidate their holdings and rebate them to Americans living longer than 40 years in the nation. Or just to white males with income below $100,000 a year. Seeing as how those are the persons who have been disenfranchised, falsely accused, falsely imprisoned, and generally persecuted for the past half-century.

                I meant it both ways – any person doing what is necessary will be called Hitler and at the same time, he absolutely should be like Hitler, because that is what it takes. There is no nice political solution, nothing that is considered polite in today’s society.

        The Deep State spends its financial resources on mobilizing dysfunctional white liberals for chaos duty at manufactured riots. This is largely aimed at controlling the narrative, and by extension, political power. The war in Ukraine is coming to an end and there will soon be thousands of unemployed and pissed off drone builders and operators. In theory, this untapped resource could be financially incentivized to dissuade the pathogens from their evil ways. Think outside the box.

            Not sure why i got a downvote, but when an author writes this, i listen:  “The system’s ideal woman is the single mother, she’s produced with her uterus and is willing to go all in on production/consumption, she has no choice. I’m not saying she wants to be a single mother, I’m saying that’s what the system wants her to be. That’s feminism. You can get married too, as long as he’ll make it so you get in at 8.”

            Thank you.‘The barrier is in herself, sexism is merely her projection of it.’The epitaph of the U.S.It’s hilarious but typical to see privileged princesses in the U.S. rage and thrash about a ‘patriarchy’ that does not exist, except in their needful delusions. Back in the Seventies when women started to trot out the ‘that offends me’ command to every word and act they didn’t approve of, I could see where all this was going. Couldn’t stop it, tho.Harpy Hess lives in a gynocracy in which females and female concerns rule EVERY U.S. institution, with possible exception of the Executive . . . but Medea and College say it’s a patriarchy, and the Aggrieved Victim in Hess likes that juicy dramatic role, and knows it produces goodies from weak men lost in the ghettos of Romanticism and female moral superiority (i.e., most dork righty men).If America was a horse I’d have shot it long ago.

For example:To understand exactly why “feminism” or whatever Valenti thinks she has re-invented has not only stalled, but is damaging to all humanity, all you need to do is go to the source. Totally at random, I went toHuffington Post Women. Let’s see what the feminists are up to, here are the top five articles:1.The Reason The Academy Passed On Kathryn Bigelow(answer: sexism.)2.Confessions Of A Mistress(protip: “Here’s the wisdom I can offer to mistresses out there: do not get too attached.”)3.Why You Should Be Nervous– And Yet Not– About Sunday Night(since the Golden Globes conflict withGirls, just DVRGirls, and anyway Lena Dunham will be at the Globes.)4.‘Girls’ Star Talks Nudity And Season 2(I refused to even click it)5.Meet The Woman Who’s Only Eating From Starbucks

        They’re setting the stage for another Ukraine style Maidan Massacre, which, just like in Ukraine, it will never be clear who caused it…but a false narrative will emerge instantly an the truth won’t ever be known…but the blob will mysteriously come out on top.I doubt less than 25% of the American public has any concept of what a “color revolution” is, much less recognizes the completely obvious one going on right now.To the politically savvy, it’s obvious what’s going on now is a run that will piggyback on the June 14 “NoKing” rallies (totally inorganic). Small crowds will be made to look huge.The next step is to provoke a violent response from the government in response to “peaceful demonstrators.”  Left out, or downplayed, will be the 1% of aggitators who are trained on how to escalate to prove a reaction.If that doesn’t work, you may be sure SOMETHING will happen.  It will be made to happen.The “legume” revolution is funny, but they’re actually going to run this by rallying 30+ million illegal and an equal amount of white shitlibs to the MEXICAN FLAG.Putting a rag on a flag, planting it in a hill or an idea, an telling the people to rally to it is cliche…but it works.Dark days ahead.

            I don’t discount any of that and it seems plausible, but so far there has been a well-coordinated response to such things, and frankly a willingness to escalate. An attempted Color Revolution again probably ends in disaster for them, and don’t discount prolonged martial law or something of that magnitude in response. Most people would have opposed that in 2020 but would not this time. The majority will be supportive or indifferent.Note that in addition to the marginal propaganda organs downplaying what is happening, the Trump Administration also is overplaying the magnitude of it. There is a reason for that. Anything can happen but if forced to bet it would be on the Left failing epically. I never previously would have bet that way.

        “The relatively muted response to this point has had many people scratching their heads.”Perhaps somemodus vivendiwas a precondition for allowing him the job? Certainly he appears to be in more emollient mode than the first time around.“At this point, it is clear that the Los Angeles riot is synthetic.”Yep, it’s carefully orchestrated. Are there any spontaneous insurrections these days?“In this case, it highlights the fact that our rulers abetted an invasion.”Many liberals will not make the connection, or will seek to elide over it. And of course they’ll make the counterargument that there were millions of illegal aliens before the Biden years.“That leaves the rioting to the twenty-something white losers the Blob relies on as foot soldiers. Now, the blacks are taking advantage of the opportunity and looting the sneaker stores.”Agree entirely. Note how the networks are not mentioning the ethnic composition of the rioters. As you say, legal immigrants just want to keep their heads down, get on with their work and their lives, and not attract attention from the authorities. Illegal aliens just want to avoid any scrutiny whatsoever — or it’s the next bus or plane back home.On a side note I think someone here was mentioning that California is now majority non-white. A hurried Google check indicates 34% and declining. Before the Mexican-American war, it was part of Mexico. It’s notutterlyinconceivable that it one day secede. In Richard Morgan’s sci-fi novel, “13”, set a century in the future, the states of California, Oregon, and Washington have split off to form the “Pacific Rim.” The northeast and northern states have amalgamated with Canada to form the “North Atlantic Union.” What remains is the “Republic”, though as the story goes on, Arizona also applies to join the Rim.

        I live in SoCal. Bass and Newsom are on TV all the time, three or four times a day. They are loving this. Bass in particular seems to hope LA gets burned down so she can redevelop with that sweet, sweet redevelopment money and power. The ideal city is one comprised of criminal illegal aliens and homeless, and Bass views the riots as well on her way to achieving that goal.Moreover the rabid defense of illegals is based on both voting and census, so they cannot back down or they lose Congressmen and money.Newsom gave a speech, he boasted that he is part of the resistance (he had to post it twice, original feed had no audio). The goal is nationwide riots on Saturday, with the goal of removing Trump as they nearly did last time.The center of gravity is not the public. Nor the oligarchs. It is the news media: 100% peaceful protest, the judges, and the rented mobs. I would not be shocked if the whole thing was done to have a Judge rule open borders forever, and take over the Presidency. Bass and Newsom are arguing that ANY ICE raids are “inflammatory” and must end forever, or there will be more violence. This is the talking point for the pre-arranged Judge to rule. With a nationwide injunction on any arrests or raids of illegals, open borders, and control of the military going to said judge. This seems to be the play at any rate as I see it from SoCal. I have no idea of what is going on besides this.Interestingly Santa Ana and other places in Orange County are seeing riots, they did NOT have that during the Summer of George five years ago.

            “Bass in particular seems to hope LA gets burned down so she can redevelop with that sweet, sweet redevelopment money and power.”When South Central ‘burned’ for Rodney King (small black shops looted by their diverse neighbors), Maxine Waters’ district was rezoned as an ‘economic development zone’; the Asians cleared out the old, decrepit blocks and put up big, gleaming warehouses with 12′ iron fences and gold lettering in Korean and Chinese script.You can surely bet Maxine Waters’ bank was right in the middle of all that hot redevelopment action.  Karen Bass of the Cuban Venceremos Brigade must be drooling at the thought.
