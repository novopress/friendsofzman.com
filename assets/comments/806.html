        I appreciate your willingness to expound on your views here.First, I’d like to clarify: when I say ‘evolutionary psychology’ I am not referring to biological evolution on the whole.  I completely agree that biological evolution is the best model of reality we have given the fossil record and the DNA evidence across species.  However, when I say ‘evolutionary psychology’, I am referring to a specific branch of study related to evolution that takes a more psycho-social approach, which you use often to justify your views on gender roles (even in this very post).Evolutionary psychology is, in my view, a softer, more bullshittier science that tries to explain how various cultural and psychological characteristics in human beings might have evolved.  For example, one might claim that because women have evolved in such a way that necessitates a nine month pregnancy period, as well as a maximum age of fertility, whereas men have no such limitations, the best strategy for female reproduction is to retain a mate for the long run for protection and support while the best strategy for the male is to mate with as many women as possible.This is a paradigmatic claim of evolutionary psychology.  It has a great deal of explanatory power but it cannot be empirically tested in any way.  One can come up with a thousand different explanations for the same phenomenon in evolutionary psychology and there is no good way to decide which explanation is closest to the truth, because we simply cannot test them and we definitely cannot apply any Popperian falsification to these claims.  I find that cultural explanations can be just as powerful to explain gender roles, which are wholly separate from evolutionary explanations.  For this reason, I am wholly agnostic on the issue. (As a side note, I don’t think evolutionary psychology is all bullshit; in theory it’s an important field of study, it’s just that a lot of bad science goes on in it).The only good empirical evidence we have for the differences in men and woman are the obvious physical characteristics, such as strength and speed.  There is some evidence for differences in the brain structures, but these are not well established and can still be explained as being developed primarily due to how culture raises up women and men.  I’m just not so convinced of a purely evolutionary explanation for traditional gender roles.As for your views on homosexuality, I would merely caution that you not let your loathing of the leftist agenda cloud your judgment on the issue.  You claim that homosexuals are not that interested in marriage, which may be true of a large portion of them, however, I personally know many gay-people who are ‘normal’ and monogamous in the same sorts of ways as straight people and I see no reason why they shouldn’t be able to have the rights of a married couple.  Many of them want to adopt and have families of their own.  I’m skeptical of any objective reason they ought not be able to, purely because they do not have the correct biological apparatuses to create new offspring, or because many others of the same sexual orientation are not interested in marriage.  I’m also skeptical of your claims that homosexuals do not face as much persecution as society may let on; I know of many stories and anecdotes of bullying as a direct result of sexual orientation, for example. In any case, I agree that we ought to respect and stay out of people’s private lives.
