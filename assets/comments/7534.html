        There are two complications I see to this, and the first is Obama’s legacy. His legacy at this point is almost completely based on executive actions, so it’s imperative that the democrats maintain control of the executive branch or his legacy goes up in smoke. That Trump is the republican nominee as opposed to some tame Washington globalist makes this even worse.The second complication I see is that I don’t think Obama or anybody in the Democratic establishment has much of any control over Bernie Sanders voters. If Clinton goes down in flames, Bernie Sanders voters will expect Bernie to slide into the top spot. If they are denied this, I think they will flip out.I agree that Obama is playing a long game and that Clinton is his enemy, but I think there are forces out of his control. If Clinton falls before the election, Bernie has to take her place or his voters rebel completely. The game he’s playing could cost the democrat party the election and destroy his legacy. The timing of all these factors is also very delicate. I wouldn’t want to be in his shoes right now.

            That’s my question, too — who will replace Hillary at the top of the ticket?  Bernie is a True Believer, Gilded Age edition — like his college kid supporters, he always looks one bong hit away from ranting about Haymarket Square and the perfidy of the Grover Cleveland administration.  Nor can they just cut a deal with Trump after throwing him the election — they spent the last 6 months calling him Hitler Jr., and he’s not a forgiving man.  So who”s left?  Slow Joe Biden?  Lieawatha?  She’d be my bet, but she seems to be smart enough to realize it’s a sucker bet at this point.  What’s the end game for the Party?

                If they don’t pull the plug on Hilary before or during the convention, things get risky.
In 2002, the NJ Supreme Court decided to ignore the law and let the NJ Democrats switch out Torricelli on the ballot when he was indicted after the convention.  I don’t think Federal Judges (or Judges in all 50 states) are going to be so willing to carry water for the Democrats this way.
If she’s nominated at the convention, they might be stuck with her.

                    If she’s taken down before the convention, what then? Do you think Bernie and his supporters are going to tolerate being passed over for some white knight? Do you think Obama and the democrat establishment would be ok with Bernie being the nominee?

                        If – and it’s a big if – Hillary is indicted before the convention and she suspends her campaign (which I don’t think is a foregone conclusion) I might wager that she would ask her pledged delegates to support Fauxcahontas, because “wymin,” rather than Biden.  Biden is Barry’s stooge and member of the patriarchy.  Hill’s core supporters are bitter, ugly old boomers, and to have Biden upstage the vagina brigade would be a bridge too far.As you suggest however, such a scenario would be devastating to the party, in the same way that the GOP flirted with disaster over the NeverTrump nonsense before Trump’s nomination became a foregone conclusion.  To tell the Bern and his supporters that they must step aside would expose the banana republic shenanigans to the sunshine, and Bernie’s campaign rhetoric regarding the corruption of the establishment would be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt  0bama, as the head of the party, would also be tarnished by this. As other on this thread have speculated “What Would Barry Do” if push came to shove?  Would he support Sanders or a white knight?  My guess is that he would prefer to stand above the fray rather than get down in the weeds.

                Joe Biden. He’s always been the good soldier. I’m not sure it comes to that, but if Clinton has to drop out, then Biden is the answer. My bet is Clinton staggers on like a wounded animal and loses badly in November. That’s probably what Team Obama want. A humiliating defeat would kill off Team Clinton forever.

                    Im surprised no one is talking about the obvious; Bernie as VP.  His supporters will swallow that, and in one fell swoop, Trump will have his legs cut out from under him.

                        Too white for the party. They are even nuttier than the GOP leaders when it comes to the dusky vote. The Dem ticket must past the paper bag test.

                    As your local senator, Clay Davis, would say: Sheeeeeeeeit, Z Man… I’d vote for Trump just for that.  And end to the Clintons forever!  If that were the payoff for voting for Joe Stalin himself, I’d honestly have to think it over.

            I think Obama is far more grandiose to worry over what he sees as minor policy issues. He has never been fully engaged in the details of his administration. I do think he and the rest of the Mulatto Mafia hate the Clintons with an intensity that is hard for normal people to imagine.
There’s also the fact that the Left has no bench. They can clear the dead wood during a Trump regime and gear up for the the next great Progressive Awakening. They are like cicadas in that way.

                I think there’s something to what you say, but Obama has always wanted to be a transformational figure. With the exceptions of Obamacare and his own personal prestige, all of his transformations have been executive fiats, and is really a transformational figure it all that gets undone?

                I just don’t get why Team Obama would waste so much time and effort hating the Clintons. Obama crushed Hillary in 2008, and then she had to humiliate herself for the better part of a decade by working for Obama. They allegedly got along OK during this time. We know that she was a complete fuckup as Secretary of State, but Obama and his minions think they did a great job with foreign policy, so he can’t hold that against her. My take is, given that Obama is vain and completely self-centered, he became largely indifferent to the Clintons once his humiliation of Hillary was complete. If he is trying to undermine Hillary’s campaign– and you can definitely make a case for that– my guess is, his motivation revolves around his personal future: how to make money for himself, and how to maintain influence for his ridiculous anti-white, anti-american, pro-communist ideas. He knows that, if they won, the Clintons would close a lot of doors to Obama because, while Obama is indifferent to the Clintons, the Clintons definitely resent Obama. So, Biden would clearly be Obama’s best bet going forward– a decision fueled not by hatred, but by cold rational self-interest.

                        Agree with you in principle, but I think Obama’s genius is in combining overweening, world-class narcissism with cold, calculating self-interest. He isn’t particularly intelligent, but he has a certain kind of low cunning that has served him remarkably well. The only time he shows emotion is when he feels like he is being ignored or disrespected. The Clintons tried to disrespect him, and he crushed them, so I’m guessing he feels like he made his point and moved on.

            Taco, you bring up a salient point. These people are so dirty, the crimes and corruption so rampant, actually the entire federal system is literally infested with the disease of corruptions, it is most likely impossible to hide how bad it truly is. The current regime, along with all the administrative branches of tyranny, they need a Clinton, or another crony insider to assume the throne of power, just to retain the veil of obstruction of this organized crime syndicate aka federal government. What was it week before last the Won, through executive diktat, decreed a transition team will be mandatory before the next president assumes power. Ah excuse me, a transition team? You mean a clean up crew to hide the bodies and the backtracks to where all our wealth has gone too? Are these clowns becoming nervous Donald J Trump might win? And with that, a mandate of the will of a very large plurality of people rightfully screaming for blood over what these past regimes have done? All ready that mandate is growing to the point of un-deniability. Preference cascades of legitimate nature are unstoppable once they reach a critical mass.

                I hope Trump and his party start off with an omnibus bill: “Undo every act, fire every hire”, thenundo the civil service act – which was supposed to prevent partisan hiring, but just gets in the way of firing all the (D)lirtbag political hacks infesting the govt.. After that they can replace department heads and get to some serious investigation. There’s no sense “playing nice” with (D)irtbags – they  will always act in a vicious and underhanded manner anyway.Without the civil service act the only hope of a lifetime career would be strict neutrality, and they’d all fear having a hostile replacement looking carefully at everything they did – with no hope of a presidential pardon.

        ZMan, I think you are underestimating Hillary by calling her a mere “criminal”. She’s a psychopath.Sociopath: Erratic, impulsive criminal behavior, marked by excessive risk-taking = BillPsychopath: Controlled, violent, premeditated criminal behavior = HillaryI’m quite sure that Hillary was the prime mover behind the “Arkancide” death squads, while Bill was the gladhanding front man who can emote and “feel your pain”. Hillary cleaned up Bill’s messes and ran the machinery of murder and corruption. I’m sure she’s the brains behind the CGI as well. There’s a reason they’ve stuck together all these year: they make quite an effective team.

        Have always thought Foundation would be weak point and sort of surprised it has not figured more prominently.  By odd happenstance spent a two days that will never be recaptured at a pair of CGI meetings right after Hillary finished up as SoS.  (a trading partner of my old firm was pressuring us to join–so I was the “diligence” guy).  The best way to visualize is to go back to the bar scene in the original Stars Wars.  Oddest collection of Clinton associates, NGO do gooders, contractors-on-the-make, folks (obviously foreign) who never gave a straight answer as to who they worked for…etc.  Lots of nice talk about helping the world, working groups of every stripe and no real specifics on what they were doing.  Though at one Chelsea intro’d the new guy (ex-McKinsey) who was being brought in to help develop “scorecards”.  Don’t thing that went to a dog show. Entry ticket for joining was $350k.  Financial guys looked through the statements and came to the independent conclusion that this was really a vehicle to support the Clinton lifestyle, park their court members on retainer and little more. Declined to join–though the half floor of sales people over on 6th avenue were not good at taking no for an answer.ps. met Hillary at one of the cocktail closers and yes SNL has it right. “I only talk to real people because I want to be President”  she was positively reptilian.  Bill still had the spark, though.

        Death by a thousand cuts for her and W.C. Fields-look-alike partner BJ, is too good for these slime balls.  However, what is most disturbing is the number of people who still support these “partners-in-crime” despite all the issues, miscues, and on Hillary’s part, lack of accomplishments.  They have sold us out to not only the Chinese but the EU desk jockeys in Brussels, the UN and others all while working their damnest to destroy America.  Putting her in office would be a continuation of Socialism in the White House.  I wouldn’t be surprised if one of Obummer’s last acts would be to paint America’s house … black.  The “White” House is racist don’t you know.  Trigger time!

        Destroy the Democratic Party? It’s already dead. We’re just waiting for the coroner.There’s a strong, slow heartbeat in American politics. It beats about every generation or so. Consider the big “change” elections of the last century – 1932, 1952, 1980, 2008. The Hope and Change of 2008 didn’t do the trick so now we’re having a summer rerun. Since the disaster of 2008 the Republicans have surged to a political domination in everything from dog catcher to Congress that hasn’t been seen in 80 years. The establishment is toast on both sides. Donald and Bernie are reenacting Sherman’s march through Georgia.Morning in America? More like a good thorough spring cleaning. ‘Bout time, says me.

        Not many things in politics more satisfying than watching these psychopaths eat their own. Desperate despots like the pants suit can end up doing desperate things. She is starting to look and behave in a desperate manner, at least there are cracks showing in the facade. I always felt she never had the savvy to be a successful coruptocrat, she always has required others to much of the heavy lifting and wet work. That woman is a truly nasty piece of work, her sycophants have to have not much going for them either to work for her. I guess with the river of dirty money she has at her disposal in the Clinton foundation she can make up for a lot of bad character traits. But she must have rung up an incredible amount of markers that will be due if she is installed as the Red Queen. The portent scope and scale of corruption possible is almost unimaginable. You want to talk about the US becoming a banana republic, good lord almighty. I truly do wish for it to become an every increasing hubristic orgy of self destruction. Hubris before the fall that is. I can’t figure which is worse, the pants suit, or those who carry water for her and are voting in her favor. Maybe there is no difference, its a package deal.

                Well that right there, they are all dirty. It is what they are. Imagine the leverage even as despicable and nasty a creature Hillary is, has over so many, and not just political leverage, there are some truly diabolical crimes been committed. The list is almost to bloody to believe. For instance, are you aware the Maura Building in Oklahoma City was the depository of all paper records for a variety of investigation’s involving Clinton association corruption going back before they occupied the white house? That before casualties where tended to after the bombing, a squad of federal agents rifled through surviving document caches. If there is truth in that somewhere, can you calculate the list of people you have by the short and curly’s in your little black book, or is it Blackberry, who had to be involved in a conspiracy like that? That whole scenario worked out very well if so, Bill Clinton had a psychopathic hate for the “militia’s” that where springing up throughout the country in the 90’s. Then add in all the subsequent scandals and atrocities, Waco, Ruby Ridge, Fast &amp; Furious, Vince Foster, Starr, Benghazi, Libya. How about the 265 million dollars, Hillary took receivership of in the mysterious sudden collapse of the Children’s Fund, just months before she was installed as a NY congresscorruptocrat, which disappeared never to be seen again? 265 Million Bucks, Poof! These people know where every penny comes from and where it goes, its why they get so rich through being corrupt. It is what they do.  The potential river of blood and trail of dead bodies behind the two of them is truly the stuff of a couple of sick individuals. Thing is, they can’t blackmail the general public, they can only try to fool them, and the margin of vote fraud is thought to be from 3-7% before it is considered too high and risky. She has taken bribe monet from about every agenda 21 and one world order corporate interest that exists. There isn’t enough hours in the day to satisfy those markers and administer to the will of the dirt people who didn’t grease her greasy meathook.
