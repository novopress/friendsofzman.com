        Actually, messy-cans are Christians and hard workers, in contrast with the parasiticdemon-rats plaguing this country…The real problem is the arbustos are creatures of the muslim mafia…under their reign, we have seen TWO attempts at toppling America, the last one successful at 9/11 AND the attack of Saddam Hussein, who was threatening the shrubs puppets masters, the Saudis of Arabia…must we remind you guys that the Bin Laden family STILL run things in Macca? Please read up on the 1979 take over of the Caboose(Great Mosque) where the Bin Laden family turned over control of the civilized world to the Wahabis(the same people than the Daesh(ISIS)…the whole rigmarole ended up with a Muslim in the White House, Barry Hussein…Now watch the Saudi controlled MSM push Juan Eduardo Bush to replace the blatantly incompetent Barry for a more effective Caliphate…

        “Legend has it he was the Bush son groomed for the presidency, not his brother. The cards just fell the right way for W and not for Jeb.”
Pretty much this, it was Jeb Bush one of the originals PNAC manifesto signators, W. came as a outsider.

        Jeb, the first transracial president! Maybe Rachel Dolezal can be his VP?
Because he sounds like a Mexican trapped in a fitting chubby white body…

        It was interesting. He’s at the very bottom of the list there, but I have to admit he gave a very good speech.  You’re not kidding about him being a political animal.

        No way in hell am I voting for Jeb. Unless he promised to deport every last Moslem. Then I’d vote for him.
