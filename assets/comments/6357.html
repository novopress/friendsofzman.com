        I don’t believe it’s real. It’s on a comedy video channel on YouTube. Maybe they just found it, but… more than once she seems like she’s trying not to laugh.

                Oh yes, the phenomenon is horribly and hilariously real.

        I wonder why people self-identified as Napolean in the past, whereas no one seems to identify as a famous person now. Then again, after a crime is committed, it’s not uncommon for people to self-identify as having committed it and going to the police to turn themselves in.I don’t quite believe these otherkin have the same desire to believe they are animals to the extent that these trans desire to believe they’re the opposite sex but I hope they enjoy some success in order to blow up the bubble of trans-reality. The man who thinks he’s a 6 year old girl should always be talked about in this context.

        When I was teaching, a yoof told me he spent a lot of time when not at college (and judging by his lack of work probably most of the time in college dreaming about) being a horse. Apparently he had this horse’s head that he would wear, especially at conventions where he would meet other horses and maybe other animals. He was very proud of his ‘equininity ‘ and perhaps one day would meet the right mare (I am assuming he was a stallion, but you never know, do you?).However, there was one redeeming feature of this desire to horse around: everyone else in the class thought he was nuts. So there is hope for the human race.

            There’s a convention for these people:https://www.otakon.com/
This is the sort of thing that arises from a society where the poorest of the poor are fat, own a smart phone and have easy access to drugs, sex and alcohol.

                Or he was just being playful. Like the get-togethers where people re-enact ancient battles.
