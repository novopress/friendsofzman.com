        ‘At the same time, the agents start wearing suits and the corresponding for female agents’Rong.  You still don’t get it.NO females.  When a female — even one — enters a male space, everything subtly changes.  Men change their behavior and then, gradually, the organization begins to change to make it more ‘female friendly’.Women (and weak men) then bring in other women and guaranteed, they will organize and demand changes . . . a speech code . . . fudged standards . . . men helping out with the heavier duties . . . on and on.  Soon you’ll have deviation to the Left because that’s what females do.  You do not understand that your Feminist Nation is a FAILURE and more inclusion of women where they don’t belong assures more of the same.The Effing Bee Eye should be disbanded and its principals arrested and tried for a variety of offenses against the citizenry.  If something new replaces the FBI, then no females or open homos or trannies etc.

            NO females?
Too strict.
Depends on the job assignment. Unarmed, non-supervisory jobs doing desk or lab work? Sure.

                Ray has a point.  What I think you miss here is how the inclusion of women spreads a poison into the organization.  To wit, Feminism of the current wave inevitably will try to undermine the logical assignments of agents, male and female, into different roles within the organization.So yes, women could indeed find roles within the FBI quite suited to their skill sets, however they will not be content with such and seek to expand within the organization into areas staffed by men—to the detriment of the whole.  To this effect, one need not look specifically at the FBI, but at any large metro LEO organization.  They’ve all been “poz’d” over the last couple of generations.

                    This is one of the things that has led to the explosion of the number of cops.  Most criminals are young men and the women simply cannot handle them.  When female cops arrest young men, it’s only because the young men didn’t fight.  For every woman they hire, they need an extra man.Of course, the second there are women cops, there are demands for promotion.  You end up with a bunch of incompetent women running the dept.  They are also pretty infamous for suing the departments or for going on permanent disability (with full pay) the very first time they have anything happen which could theoretically cause an injury, either physical or mental.Theoretically, there are good reasons to have some female cops.  There have been female cops for a long time.  But ever since all the civil rights crap and the quotas and the ease of suing, women just destroy PDs.

                                Probably. The famous inability of basketball-Americans to shoot straight is related to the fact that so many are felons. They may have guns but they can’t really openly go to the range to practice without risking arrest and few of them live where it’s rural enough to just go out and blast some cans in the woods. The lesbian (let’s be honest) cops at least have to do range time.

                        Agree.  PD retains a SMALL unit of females for body searches etc., but ALWAYS under direct supervision of males.  No diversity no quotas no empowerment no nothing.
Same principle with, for example, hospitals.  Enough nurses for personal care, always under male supervision.  No more dancing TikTok vids celebrating special attention because Covid.

                    Most police work is unsuitable for females. Ditto for the armed forces. The military once had a female component (e.g., the WACs and Army Nurse Corps) that did good work. Both the police and military should return to that model (although I will not hold my breath waiting foe it to happen).

                        There was the recent video of a female cop in Florida trying to disarm this brotha. In fairness he was being completely compliant. But due to either lacking sufficient hand strength or incompetence or the jitters, she managed to shoot the guy in the leg with his own gun. Just one incident but they add up. It should be obvious by now.

                ZMan: “They simply stopped caring about their core function and stopped caring about their own standards.“I fear that the reality of the situation is vastly worse even than that.My best guess is that Personalities are determined at conception, and that for the vast overwhelming majority of the population, the Personality they are dealt at conception [i.e. Spermatozoon-x-Ovum] is precisely the Personality they will take with them to the grave.In particular, the ruination of the FBI came about via the infiltration of Passive Aggressive personality types into the DOJ bureaucracy, and the FBI simply became another psycho-sociological appendage of the Hive Mind of Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder.Note that Z’s “Managerialists” will almost always be almost entirely Passive Aggressive in their innate personalities, and there’s nothing whatsoever we can do about it, short of going all Active Aggressive on said“Managerialists”.I probably shouldn’t write anything more than what I’ve written already, but suffice it to say that if you want to clean up a thoroughly converged hive of Passive Aggressive villainy, such  as what we’re dealing with in the 21st Century FBI, then you have to be ready to go 110% actively aggressive on thePassive Aggressives, in  precisely the style of Scipio Africanus versus Carthage.

            Ladies can do certain FBI jobs. My Mom worked in the FBI Fingerprint division in the old days, which was mainly run (well) by women. She says their theme song was “Some Day My Prints Will Come”…..

            It’s been a few decades since secretaries started disappearing from offices. Men learned how to do our own typing on a computer, but we could bring back the secretary, subject to your policy. Fags who sneak in and claw their way to the top will want someone to flirt with, to relieve the stress associated with pretending to be straight and maintaining a wife at home.Otoh, we could do something else. Chesterton’s fence is useful imagery here. Now that being out of the closet is normalized, we ought to think about ways to keep it normalized while andrarchy and patriarchy are being restored.

            Yep, I am also super pro-Patriarchy.  Women have no business in most work, public life, politics, and voting.  Of course there are individual capable and smart women, but so what?  They and society are better off having healthy kids young.  Men and women are different and that nature must be respected.  Sperm is cheap and eggs are expensive, as heartiste would say.  Women are inherently MORE valuable than men so let that value be used properly!And the presence of women will subtly or unsubtly deplete male camaraderie because of demoralization, lower standards, and the FACT that sexual competition over women is THE most powerful instinct of men.Men kill and conquer OTHER men so as to take their territory and women for THEMSELVES.  Not to give them “the vote.”

                There really aren’t ‘capable’ women as such.  Sure, they’re capable in womanly roles.  The key point about male roles is that men naturally respect the hierarchy.  Women don’t, so they confuse their almost insignificant roles (Madame Curie, Rosalind Frank) as *important contributions*, rather than make-work projects.

                    Yes.  A fundamental difference between the male and female that Americans refuse to see: males are hierarchical, and females are communitarian or equalist.  Men desire freedom; women desire safety.
Therefore, females force nations Leftward — the direction that Cthulhu swims — and males move nations Rightward.

            Not to disagree, Ray, but I stopped in to comment on my one experience with an FBI agent, a woman, and your comment comes up first; looks like you hit the popularity jackpot for the day. So I’ll just say what I wanted to say, and slink off…In 2006, when my daughter was being vetted for a security clearance, a very pleasant and professionally-dressed young woman came to our house and talked with me and the missus for about ninety minutes. All routine, of course, but thorough and occasionally unnerving. It was, after all, testimony under oath to a federal investigator.Examples:“Oh, you have a sister-in-law who grew up in Rangoon? Let’s talk about that…” (to me).“You made three trips to London in two years between 1981 and 1983. As these were not business trips, and given you have no family there, please explain why you took all these trips in such a short time.” (to me, primarily).“Can you recall any time when your daughter – or son – broke the law?” (to us both).*“Your brother works for an international company based in Paris, and travels extensively in his work. Please expand on his work and on where he travels on business.” (to my wife).“You spent two months in Thailand in 1984? Why?” (to me again).*This was an attempted kill shot. We both knew that our son had been arrested for petty larceny, and that a good family lawyer had the whole thing “expunged” with the understanding that he’d have no criminal record. Luckily, my wife and I had a conversation about this before the interview. I told her, much to her dismay, that if the subject comes up, we have to tell the truth. Otherwise, I pointed out, we’d be lying to an FBI agent, which – then as now – is a criminal offence.To sum up, this field agent asked all the kinds of questions that you’d expect a trained professional to ask, while watching for hesitations, evasions, eye contact between myself and my wife, etc., all part of the interrogator’s art.She was 100% a professional investigator. She closed her notebook, thanked us for our time, and left.My daughter got her clearance, if anyone cares. She’s a U.S. Marshal now, and say what you will, Ray, I am proud of her. Hard core patriot and smart as a whip.

                I think I can say, she got her clearance—but not from your interview.  Of course, you could have sunk her, but I suspect they spoke with folk you’ve never heard of before and all those interviews came back clear.

                Regular police did that too of course.
It was darkly comedic to see the same people who just a few years earlier shoved machine guns in the faces of farmers for selling unpasteurized milk go on to publicly signal allegiance to rioting savages.
Those thin blue line flags are now just another variant of the burn loot murder flags shitlibs adorn their yards with as far as I’m concerned.

        I am on the side of abolishing all secret police agencies.  They are inconsistent with who we are, or were, or ought to be, as a nation.But the first step of any “reform” effort is decapitation.Send the entire 7th floor to the border to do actual work while they await being recalled and deposed.What would result from this?  Some might be allowed to return to duty, even promoted.  Others will be transferred to more suitable agencies such as the Bureau of Prisons.  Some will be fired.  Many will retire.And some will be prosecuted for their own criminal activity, or for engaging in a conspiracy to obstruct justice by failing to disclose any crimes committed by fellow agents, other federal employees, other law enforcement agents, informants, foreign nationals, or contractors.All agents who have retired since 2015 should also be deposed.All agents who retired between 1992 and 2014 should be required to fill out questionnaires and submit sworn affidavits in order to continue to receive federal benefits or engage in contract work of any kind.The chances of any of this happening are slim.  But this ought to be the baseline scenario if the agency is not to be abolished.

            This is a great idea. It has a strong overlap with my comment, but I think is much better in clarity. Yes. As they feel under threat of a job and a future you make them perform a duty that is essential to our cause. Identify with proper psychological profiling the ones who will respond to positive reinforcement on a joint mission with ICE and NorCom to fully engage in mass deportation. Likely their role will be to do enforcement on the merchant class and assist field agents with ICE and NorCom to punish merchants who.The next thing will be to investigate treason. There is no shortage of traitors at every level of society in all institutions to get their rocks off on abusing. Just flip the incentives and change the target and in most cases you will get.Academic Agent has a cool video on The Case For Emperor Palpatine that is quite clever and illustrates what we are talking about here.In any case, good idea well presented Vegetius.

        Waco. ATF/FBI + Schumer + Reno + Clinton.There will be no reform without consequences. People who perpetrated crimes must be punished and kicked out. Pick the most egregious ones and make the cases high profile. Use the new media to include trial by media. Turnabout is fair play. As Sam Dickson has said, “We are in an alley fight.”Then these organizations need their instincts channeled for good. No more military adventures in the Hindu Kush. If we want a humanitarian military then it goes to South Africa to help Afrikaaners and Anglos to establish their own autonomous territories with security agreements with America. Then they can flourish and we can benefit from the revival of an ingenius and inventive and creative people.Similarly tough love for Europe. In the FBI, the role should be to punish enemies of the state. There is no going back. Defunding the Left’s patronage and political network until it is choked out and lifeless is step one. Preventing it from ever rising again may need to be the mission. There is also the task of getting all of the illegals out. Turn them againstIf they want to exercise power over people, that task and power should be directed against the enemies of the people. Use the FBI to track down every last illegal and mark them for deportation. Use the FBI to punish those who facilitate remittances and hiring illegal aliens.We seized control of a tyranny. Now the task is to use that toolset to be ruthless in applying those tools for Our benefit. You can’t just want to be left alone. That is how we got here. We need to hire into such agencies a bunch of young White guys who already know the mission and the location of the clock’s hands. As another astute commentator has said, “America was in kiddie pool politics for 250 years. Those days are over. We are no longer in the kiddie pool.”

                Yes. Speaking of which, the ADL also trains the FBI on what hate is. I was chased off of “Conservative” platforms for pointing this out and raising the specter of dual loyalty. The TSA equipment is I believe all developed in Israel and that agency is also trained by Israelis.
It is too soon for this, but at some point those arrangements must and will be challenged. Going after this aspect of the FBI is going to be a big enough win.

        While agreed that slovenly appearance is an issue, if only that were the problem!During the Summer of Floyd, which we now know was funded through USAID and directed and coordinated by the FBI/DOJ, calls went out to “abolish the police!” Of course, nothing of the sort was intended by the deranged gay race communists. What they wanted was local law enforcement supplanted with thugs and monsters who take direct orders from D.C. They did not trust the political loyalty of local cops. Remember, when the tranny shot up the Nashville Christian school the FBI sealed her diary and records and the local cops there leaked out her anti-white screed. You know who got into trouble. The FBI literally orchestrated an attempted murder of an anti-Islamist in Texas a few years earlier. The fabric “analysis” division was busted as fabricating evidence for more than twenty years. The list is endless.We have to reject the framing that the FBI can be in any way reformed. It cannot. Sometimes an institution is so thoroughly corrupted that it has to be torn out root and branch. While it was a troubled institution long before it murdered Randy Weaver’s wife in cold blood and incinerated religious cultists, the FBI has been rotten more or less since its founding at the turn of the last century. Just yesterday the FBI was discovered to be leaking to Venezuelan gangsters that immigration raids were about to be conducted against them. This is known as a day ending in “y.”Abolish it and any other law enforcement with national jurisdiction. Look at what it is doing to whites while they remain a majority and imagine the thuggery and oppression against them in the next generation. Prosecute and execute any agents involved in murders, and there are several, and send a message.Close it.Salt the earth where the headquarters stood.

            Very well said!You have touched on something in passing that is of extreme importance but that few Americans understand: that ALL law enforcement in America is LOCAL. I read with distressing frequency screeds about property taxes being “the most immoral tax of all” is the way it is usually worded, the notion–I won’t call it an idea–being that one does not own one’s own property but merely rents it, etc., etc. I’m sure you have run across it.But nobody stops to consider that under the American constitutional system, the police power inheres in the People, who have merely delegated their power to a subset of the population, paid for through LOCAL property taxes. That is why a citizen’s arrest remains entirely lawful (although I do not recommend trying it nowadays).This is why we–alone as far as I know–of all countries in the world do not have a NATIONAL police force. If we did, we’d have long ago been reduced to slavery.Indeed, the High Sheriff of any county is the *elected* Chief Law Enforcement Officer of that jurisdiction, and not even the FBI can do anything within his jurisdiction without his knowledge and consent, although sheriffs do allow the FBI to ride roughshod over them, although how widespread that is, I don’t know. I do recall that 30-odd years ago, the sheriff of San Miguel County, Colorado, found some FBI agents operating in his county without his knowledge or consent, and he locked them up and told Washington to come and get them. That was before the Clintons and Janet Reno. And before our countrymen elected–twice–a president who KEPT his promise/threat “to transform America fundamentally.”Which is exactly what he did.But you are right: Reform is a fool’s game. Root and Branch. Sow salt. And TEACH the People about jury nullification. Not that it will do much good. The country cannot survive another ten years in its present configuration. Nor should it.

        Suggestion:
The total end of the FBI Interview Form 302.
It’s an outrage that the FBI can conduct an unrecorded interview, take notes, write a memo…REVISE that memo weeks later under their supervisors pressure, and that has the force of a recording to a court of law.
Outrageous. The government is rich. They can record every interview. The purpose of a system is what it does…this one is ripe for abuse.
What honest citizen, knowing this, would EVER speak to an FBI agent?

            My mom and dad did, and they paid for it. Took about $100k to clear the “lying to a Federal Agent” resolved when they misremembered the the date of something that happened nearly 2 decades in the past. And which they were not involved, other than happening to be where it happened, so were witnesses.
Never talk to any LEO about anything of consequence. Ever. As the deputy who lives down the road from me says, “Nothing you tell me is ever off the record.” Not because that’s the kind of guy he is, but because it is “the law”.

        This speaks to the militarization of federal law-enforcement agencies and police as a whole. One unnoticed aspect of DEI in the fed agencies (though perhaps not local police as they seem to be constantly understaffed) is that the slots for white men was reduced dramatically.The only white guys who had a preference that matched blacks and women were white men who had served in the military. As a result, govt agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies, are heavily staffed with ex-military men (and women). The same is also true for state and local police.Obviously, a certain kind of guy joins the military in the first place. Most get their fill of the lifestyle and culture and move on to normal jobs and lives, but some enjoy culture and “boys with toys” fun of it but perhaps don’t want to be forced to move around all the time, so they leave the military and join a fed agency or the police.These guys take the military culture with them and part of that culture is an “insider vs outsider” mentality. Career military guys are very into the military and their buddies. The same happens at the agencies and police.Z’s suggestion that FBI agents have a degree in accounting or finance would eliminate 99% of the problems. But it will be difficult to end the military culture in the agencies and police if you continue to hire mainly ex-military white men.

                Exactly. These aren’t just ex-military guys. They’re ex-military with combat experience. And not combat experience against an organized, similar military but insurgencies where you patrol city streets and break into buildings to find bad guys who dress like civilians.
That kind of experience might just have an impact on what kind of FBI agent or cop you become.

The worst of the worst tend to be things like QC, or motor pool, or, especially, MP. Combat can have itchy trigger fingers, but they have first hand experience that death is permanent, so apart from the psychos, they tend to have a lot better discipline.

                Yes. For centuries the Romans had a much healthier way to deal with its veterans. The veterans colonies were positive. The Empire could reconstitute this idea but by putting the colonies or creating civic leadership by vets back in their home towns, counties and cities. This would bring back the talented and forged men that were taken from them and bring the money and rewards of Empire back to those communities. If you are going to have an Empire, it should benefit the Republic. Anyway, there is a lot in taking the Roman veteran’s colonies idea and adopting it for American’s benefit by making them veterans civicum that restore the developed human capital back into the civic bodies from where they came.

                There hasn’t been much combat in the last 10 to 12 years now, if you call shooting goat herders, combat.   GWOT wasn’t exactly Iwo Jima or even Hue.   Ex military or not, the wanna be running around in full body army with night vision goggles and fully automatic rifles are the most annoying clowns around.  North Hollywood and a few other places maybe showed the need for more firepower but maybe just better tactics.

            I think an even bigger problem is the hiring of non-white men and then creating a culture where subjugating and genociding White people is the most positive moral good. The Regime has really lit a giant bonfire and surrounded it with powder across the country with that one.The Biden regime we saw pictures of mostly blacks making arrests of White men. Remember that Daniel Penny’s trial was only a couple of months ago. He won, but the hostility of our enemies was only stoked by the outcome. We are in far greater danger of an anti-White regime whose enforcement arm is hostile non-whites.The insular bro culture is a problem, but I’ll take it any day over a hostile and alien enforcement arm. Most of the bro culture problem goes away if the disposition of The Regime is pro-American. If you change the mission and redefine the enemy, that is if you change the orders they are following, then you probably solve a big part of the problem. Once the enforcement arm is purged of our folk, then the situation is dire.

            A few years back (Biden years) I saw photos of (IIRC) police at the U.S. Capitol. I was appalled. They looked like they could have just stepped off a plane from Kingston, Jamaica, given the hairstyles and other grooming. The only things missing were the colorful Rasta hat and a spliff billowing smoke out of their mouths, Mon. I grew up in the DC area and between late 60s and early 2000s never saw anything so “ethnic.” In more conservative times, Negro officers were well-groomed, shorter hair, no beards, etc. My how times change.

                It’s been a big thing recently in leftist jurisdictions to pass Negro “hair” laws. It’s literally illegal to tell them they can’t wear dreads and cornrows. Even the military did something similar, the Army can’t tell Sikhs to shave or something like that.

        “They arrive in full battle gear and have a hostile attitude to arrest mothers holding their children.”Or in the case of Vicki Weaver, skip the arrest completely and have your slant-eyed FBI sniper (Lon Horiuchi) just dome her from sniping distance causing the infant to fall to the ground while the unarmed mother’s brains leak out nearby.In no universe that is even remotely just would Horiuchi not be in prison for cold blooded murder, but he got not so much as a slap on the wrist much less jail time.And that is the thing NONE of them do. Ever.Trump may clean out the communists from the agency, that is a good first step, but will he enforceaccountability? Likely not. He is a cop-sucker to the extreme so he will simply replace -their- goons, with -his- goons.There is a very simple way to make all this stop tomorrow. But it will never happen.Erase qualified immunity. Instantly, this insane police state behavior would largely evaporate. I’ll hold my breath over here waiting for that to happen.It is with no small sense of the irony of the situation that I find myself posting this thought from across the ocean in Europe. That radical (and expensive) move, driven in no small part, by the gross weaponization of local police against me in the very manner we are talking about. And I’m one of –many– who have had such an interaction. Apparently even Z himself getting a much smaller and less life altering taste.Rise of the Warrior Cop by Balko was mentioned here too. That was 2013, things have gotten MUCH worse in the last 12 years.No as much as I like the moves Trump is making, I think this general Police State trend will not be going away especially with Larry Ellison all but bragging that he wants to use AI to make sure everyone is on their “best behavior”.

        “The ones not playing soldier are slovenly couch potatoes with the disposition of a postal clerk“.Reminds me of when Farage said Van Rompuy had the “charisma of a damp rag” and the appearance of a “low-grade bank clark.”It does beg the question “What is the actual scope of the FBI” and are they operating within the limitations of the law which I suspect has been far over reaching for decades.I find it interesting that many of the American police departments have started dressing like para-military members with combat boots, cargo pocket pants, etc., It sends a message to the public that these people are members of an occupying Army intent on controlling the public and not “Protecting and Serving” the public as they would have us believe.

            I worked in a semi-rural county, with the largest city having a population of around 45,000.  The sheriff’s department there not only had a relatively new military Humvee, but also some huge armored vehicle, bigger than a Sherman tank.  Both were kept hidden in a big warehouse-type building.
This mostly-white county had some crime, but mostly because of a growing drug-abuse problem.  I don’t recall seeing any bands of mujahadeen or Houthis around.

                “…the laws are so vague and so prolific that anything can be construed as a violation of the law.”
And in this we return to a prescient Ayn Rand who long ago wrote:
“There’s no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren’t enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.”

            It sends a message to the public that these people are members of an occupying Army intent on controlling the public.That’s a helpful analogy, and few people give any thought to the possibility that police forces are emasculating and socially divisive. Powerful policing turns the great mass of men into dependent, perfumed sissies who look to one of the local cops to be the first man in their lives. Local social hierarchy, which is natural, is disrupted so that capital and democracy can have obedient workers and docile tax payers controlled by armed farm hands.Men do not organize theirselves organically and spontaneously for their security and general welfare but wait around for the farm’s rigidly institutional management to organize tax eating farm hands—who serve and protect the institutional hands which pay them.Meanwhile, the women learn to accept the state as their husband and their provider of first and last resort. When this husband tells them to demonstrate publicly in favor of swarming immigration, many women dutifully obey their favorite husband. They’ll even spread their welcoming legs as if their role models for sexual ethics were bonobos.We have become slaves, farm animals, and degenerates. Oh, and isn’t there’s something else, too, going on here?American cop,Zionist cop.

        The younger age cohort’s arrogance about job prospects will come to bite them. I see it with my nieces and nephews, and, to a certain degree, despite by warnings, with my own children. “I’ll just quit this job and easily get another”. If they make me “return to office” I’ll quit. If they make me follow the rules I’ll quit. If they don’t praise me and pat me on my head I’ll quit. Musk could, pulling a number out of my butt, get rid of 30% of the bureaucracy by just making them show up and not giving them “free” coffee.

        Rise of the Warrior Cop by Stephen Balko is a great chronicle on how law enforcement agencies got out of control. They view us as the Israelis view the Gazans.Balko is a flaming cultural Marxist, but his critiques against civil asset forfeiture (where cops can steal your property even if you haven’t committed a crime) and the federal program to supply military-surplus equipment, vehicles and even helicopters to law enforcement agencies ring true.I’ve told this story before, but when I was commuting to my Air National Guard unit in full dress uniform, I got pulled over by the SWAT team and they had all of the tactical gear. When they saw a white guy in an officer’s uniform was in the driver’s seat, they sent me on my way. Apparently, a similar looking car to mine was used in a drive-by shooting.

            I had a similar incident years ago. I was driving a friends car and was set upon by a tactical unit. I was thrown onto eh ground and frisked. It turned out that the car they were looking for was a different make, model and color and the driver was black. I have since learned that this is so common there is an cottage industry for lawyers to sue the cops over this stuff. Now we have YouTube channels dedicated to it. Billions of tax payer dollars are pissed away because of it.

                I have a good friend who is retired LEO of many years.   He was stopped in his vehicle for a traffic violation.  So what’s the big deal?  Well this was in the city and the officers worked for the Park Services (IIR).  They were part of a group of rookies “in training”.  They were all lined up on a stretch of road and told to pull over everyone whom they saw violate a traffic law.  Their performance was evaluated by their training officer.  Of course, every other car traveling by was stopped for one or more “violations”.  To keep the ire of the citizens to a low level, only warnings were issued by the rookie officers!My LEO friend, upon identification, got to critique the rookie officer on his “traffic stop”, which I glean was very informative since he is heavily armed at all times. I was dumbfounded, but held my tongue.  Z-man is spot on in today’s commentary.  Something is very wrong in this country with policing and those who enter the profession.

                    The militarization of police began after the 1965 Watts riots.  A second and larger wave began after the 1992 riots and continued until 2001.
The militarization of federal law enforcement agents and everyone else kicked into overdrive after 9/11.
LEOs who tended to deal mostly with illegal campfires and bear jams were told that they were the point of the spear in the GWOT.

        “Free people do not tolerate paramilitary units operating in their society.”This happened long ago with PDs across the US. It is no way limited to the FBI or other federal police.The other aspect of the militarization of the cops is the anarcho-tyranny that has been unleashed in much of the country.  They refuse to enforce the law against the criminal class while enforcing every jot and tittle against the law abiding citizen, particularly in civil offenses with fines.We also have armies of cops literally robbing people on the side of the road of any cash or valuables they may have.  That whole system is corrupt to the core.  If you are willing to a hire a lawyer to try and prove your money is innocent (yes, the burden is reversed, you must prove your money has not been involved in criminal activity), they stall and stall to run up the attorney fees.  Then they will call them a week before before trial and offer to settle for 50% of what they stole.Despite all the massive militarized police we have, let some wind-up psycho go into a school and start shooting children, and they will wait outside in huge numbers and tackling parents desperately trying to save their children.  “It’s too dangerous… officer safety….”

        Z is spot on about what should happen but it will never happen. The blob sees the average American, White right of center variety, as the enemy. So, it is an occupation army by design.We will be told that making the FBI dress in suits and not act like an occupation army is fascist. Fascism seems like a good system.Plus, if you were fat but wanted to be a bad-assed military guy which, if you were paid the same, would you rather go after: violent street thugs, the cartel or a suburban woman? Would you rather spend countless hours looking at a computer monitor or go have a beer with a dimwit and get him to commit a crime?Trump has just announced they will only fire 80 something FBI employees over Jan 6 and not the 5000 harassing boomers for 4 years. So no big changes.My favorite image of the modern FBI is the one of the girl boss agent pointing a rifle at a baby’s crib. White supremacists come in all ages.

                You could also have a law degree to qualify.
The accounting, law degrees and now comp sci degrees were required because the FBI mostly went after white collar crime and organized crime.

                    Not organized crime initially. Hoover was reluctant to go after them. Eventually the pressure became too much and he reluctantly established the “Top Hoodlum Program.” Rumor has it the mafia had the goods on him.
You’re right about the law degree — Nixon applied after earning his law degree from Duke.

        I would add that the 7th floor of FBIHQ was infested with politically motivated ideologues who slavishly and eagerly did the bidding of the worst elements of the blob. In the grand old tradition of the firing squad, these traitors should meet their fate sans the cigarette and blindfold. That would send a message none will find ambiguous.

        “a heavily armed gang of thugs who only care about pushing around the average citizen”
Boffo line.  Zman’s essay leaves out the political rot at the very top.  Like all careerists, the scum floating at the top are interested in protecting their pay, promotion and retirement, to the point of actively undermining the legitimate government of the republic.
I don’t think I am alone in thinking the FBI is the worst organization in the entire Blob.

        Like Marines patrolling Afghanistan? Sorry, no. Marines patrolling Afghanistan had a much higher threshold for rules of engagement, every step was taken to limit civilian casualties, most often times at the detriment of mission. Most police don’t worry about offing civilians unless they’re part of the protected classes, then they will be very careful. Don’t want to end up being the next Chauvin. The FBI even less so, those thugs on the tac teams give 0 f**** about putting you and your dog down.

        “When forty percent of the agency was used to go after the J6 people over the last four years, the agency is rotten to the core.”
Precisely the reason I’m in the “dissolve it” camp; why couldn’t the agency be disbanded with Federal Marshals picking up any slack? This nation is way too top heavy with law enforcement.

            I don’t think there’s any getting around this as proof that the agency is heavily overstaffed. You can screech insurrection all you want, but that still doesn’t change the fact that they had this many agents readily available for going after grandma who walked through the open door into the capitol.

        If you took a poll asking whether the FBI should be abolished, my guess is you wouldn’t get much more than 30% saying yes, and that’s being optimistic. This is at least 6-8 years after any honest and informed person should have been able to see that the Russia Hoax was a hoax. Which, if they cared at all, should have led them down a rabbit hole of how corrupt the agency is, were they not already aware. So the problem is a lot bigger than the FBI. It’s just a symptom. You could even say the majority is getting the federal law enforcement it deserves, and there would be some amount of truth in that. The same problems found at the FBI can be found at all of our national institutions, and enforcing dress codes and educational standards (from the academy that also has the same problems) won’t change anything. Only cleansing fire can cure.

            The question is wrong though, it should be “would you care if it was dissolved?”.  The preference would for the status quo, but if it changed then the new status quo would be good too.

        I just got to thinking about all this paramilitary gear and where they stage it. Does every large city have the FBI’s paramilitary vehicles parked somewhere? The FBI typically works out of an office building. I would imagine their gear is housed in an industrial park somewhere?
It doesn’t seem like this stuff would get used a lot and I’m sure they have it on some kind of a replacement schedule, so more money flushed down the toilet. A trillion here, trillion there …

            There’s a secret—”unmarked” at least—police armory in my neighborhood, at the official outer border of the city. Its design seems meant to give the impression that it’s some fire department thing, but the people going in and out are too fat for that (one hopes, while on fire).
When the local BLM/antifa deployment was nearby, burning down a mall etc. within sight of it, the place was more guarded than usual—but the big doors on the big building did not roll up. Whatever’s in there is reserved for us.

        You might want to start with your two year old – dress him/her like a small human instead of a rag bag, speak to them in standard English, take them to church, respect them so that they respect you. Somebody stays home to fix a sit-down dinner.  No social media in bedrooms or school.  Curfew. They might grow up to be adults instead of overstuffed couch potatoes with pockets full of neuroses.

        After the North Hollywood shootout, where two heavily armed bank robbers tried to shoot their way through a police cordon, every police department has been transformed into a paramilitary unit.It’s been a long time since I read or saw anything about the North Hollywood shoot-out so correct me if I’m wrong.  It seems to me though that the lesson taken from that could be the exact opposite of the one that was taken.  As I recall, the police did contain and take those guys down using nothing but standard issue side-arms.  I don’t even think any police were killed in the shoot out, though I do recall a couple being injured.  It didn’t necessarily imply that police needed to be more heavily armed.  Maybe just an improvement in the tatical approach to such a situation was all that was really required rather than kitting every cop out like a Navy seal.I think there was also a big shoot-out in Miami where a couple of FBI agents got killed.  The response to that I seem to remember was just to change the way agents approach suspects and not issue every FBI agent an Uzi to carry around.

            The Miami shooting made the FBI change tactics and get larger caliber weapons. You’re correct about the NH shooting, and Police armed began themselves better after 9/11.
From what I know, those gung-ho militant FBI types are a minority, and the ones who get sent out on raids. The majority of them are from certain ethnic groups (nepotism) and DEI hires, most of who would be completely worthless in shootings.

                The lesson from Miami should have been that the Feebs need more range time. Over 100 rounds at more or less point blank to get two unarmored guys who were outnumbered 4-1, as I recall. Disgraceful.
None should have received a commendation. They should have all been terminated with cause for incompetence.

            In the North Hollywood case, the cops had to go to gun shop to get weapons that could take down the robbers. There were a lot of lessons that could have been drawn from the incident, but the one every agency drew was that they needed bigger guns.

Right. The lesson they should have taken is that they need more range time. Don’t try to shoot through the body armor — shoot where it isn’t. They demand higher levels of marksmanship from us than they do from cops.

                That was indeed the excuse the cops used to lobby for more toys, but the North Hollywood shootout was such a one-off event you can’t make generalizations from it. The criminals in the case were wearing body armor and were equipped with illegally-manufactured full-auto rifles. Cops armed with only duty pistols were ineffective against them.But those criminals could have been taken out by any deer or woodchuck hunter with a bolt-action rifle firing from a position of cover. There’s simply no need for all that tactical shit and the armored vehicles and all of that nonsense. But cops get their dicks hard LARPing as hardcore operators, so…

                    The Symbionese Liberation Army shootout in 74 LA was what started the adoption of SWAT.  Cops had only 38s and shotguns I believe and were engaged with a fanatic gang of mostly vibrants.  Patty Hearst might have been there but several escaped from a tunnel from the crawl space.

            During the north Hollywood shootout the police actually went to a gun shop &amp; borrowed AR15s because they were so out gunned &amp; the suspects were wearing armor that rendered their standard issue weapons pretty much worthless.In the the aftermath of the Dade County shootout they stopped using revolvers &amp; for a time swore off 9mm before eventually going back to it later on. A 9mm went through a suspects arm into his chest cavity &amp; stopped just before his heart. It was a fatal wound but not immediately incapacitating so as a result they decided it was too weak.Personally I think incidents like these are a just cause for law enforcement to use rifles &amp; armor. I’d even go as far to say that cops in the hood should be armed with rifles by default given what they face. What I take issue of with is the policy of law enforcement using military gear &amp; tactics against non violent suspects &amp; in non exigent circumstances.Even suspects who are expected to be armed can be taken into custody without kicking in someone’s door. Used to be they’d wait for them to leave the house &amp; pull them over to detain the suspect &amp; then serve the search warrant which was much safer for everyone involved, law enforcement included. That doesn’t have a terrorizing effect of a violent home invasion to scare both the suspect &amp; the public at large though which is clearly the desired effect of the policy.

            I remember the Dade County shootout much better than the North Hollywood affair.  The FBI was at a disadvantage in Dade County because (1) the 9mm Parabellum pistols and .38 Special revolvers were unable to stop the principal assailant, despite repeated hits: and (2) the FBI had only pistols and shotguns, so the vehicles that the assailants were in provided reasonably good protection.  The FBI briefly went to a 10mm pistol, but had problems with it, and have now gone back to the 9mm Parabellum, albeit with improved ammunition.  In police departments equipped with rifles, the default option is some vesion of the AR-15, but I wonder if this is a good choice.  I wonder whether a large magazine capacity self-loader leads to promiscuous shooting–large capacity magazines are useful mostly if you plan on missing a lot–which may be the case for a military firefight, but ought not to be the rule in a police affair.  I think a lot of police would be better armed with a lever action .30-30 with quick acqusition sights than the AR.  (I do admit that many people with military service have experience with the AR but hiring people with military experience is mostly a bad idea for the reasons the Z-man post sets forth.)

                Lever actions are way more expensive, have way less ammo capacity, take way &amp; are more difficult longer to load &amp; are delicate &amp; prone to all sorts of problems. They’re also much more difficult to service, much heavier, more difficult to use in general. Worst of all they’re way less modular &amp; customizable than the AR15. They’re also designed to use rimmed cartridges which are pistol rouns which have way less effective range than the 5.56 or expensive niche calibers. That’s why neither the military nor law enforcement have ever adopted lever actions.Also, I disagree about former military becoming cops, they’re subject to way more training &amp; discipline than cops &amp; when deployed often have a way stricter code of conduct compared to police. My anecdotal experience with cops who had prior military experience is that they tend to be way more professional than their civilian counterparts.

                The 10mm worked fine, but it’s a stout man stopper, little DEI hire females couldn’t handle shooting it, so back down they went to 9mm.  Same reason most cop shops went away from the .40S&amp;W.   too stout for the 5’nothing chickie cops.The FBI Miami shootout is total incompetence by the FBI.   One car never got into it cuz they were busy banging cop bunnies.   Another agent tailing the bank robbers put his gun on the seat next to him so he could get it.  When he rammed the car, the pistol of course slid off the seat and he couldn’t get to it.   Another agent was shot was he was picking up his empty brass for his revolver just like he was trained.  (which was identified back in the 60’s by the LAPD as a problem).   There are a lot of write up on this, the FBI was completely incompetent even then.

                The suspicion at the time is that the cops intentionally let the guy bleed out. I believe the perps mother sued the police over the incident but I don’t know how that turned out.

            It’s been funny to watch men make the comparison. (You know,funny.) It takes a shocking feat of psychotic will to make oneself see in Musk a world-historic super-alpha romance novel protagonist instead of an unusually repulsive dork throwing “autistic” (retarded) tantrums and taking wholly false credit for others’ work (or nobody’s, because it was never done).I’d prefer to be wrong about this, since he’s /ourleader/ now, so, a challenge: There’s a great corpus of Elon poasting out there on the tubes. He gets fucked up and flips out on the interneta lot. Compiled this work would rival in size the writings of Caesar. Find for us, in this literary output of a whole lifetime—a great historic genius’swhole lifetime!—justone phrasehe made up himself. In his long brilliant life of so much brilliant work we can’t even see it, there must have beenone timehe had to express something no one else had already found the exact words for, and so hecame up with them himself.Let’s see it. One is enough.

        They just fixed the woke naming error, and returned Braxton Bragg’s name to the fort that is the HQ of the 82nd Airborne.Now might be a good idea to remove the “Hoover” from that building. Go back to the beginning: as in the case of Roy Cohn, currently residing in hades, one glance at the physiognomy of J. Edgar should be a enough.Before you know about the degenerate acts, allegedly caught on camera by Jewish gangster Meyer Lansky. A ratlike visage, just as his ‘second in command’ sodomy housemate, Clyde Tolson, is effeminate.At first glance. Even in a dark room.There are no “FBI” TV shows, movie characters,  that can remove the reality that this organization was founded by, and by extension on the principals, I use that word in its context … literal demons.Fast forward to the massive criminality, now uncovered for all to see, and one starts to feel the need to cross oneself, crack the family bible and read about those that ‘serve their father’ … of ‘lies’ because there ‘is no truth in them.’

            I did upvote, based on part of that, but there’s a reason physiognomy is a discredited idea. The handful of images where Lansky’s teeth show in a smile, he’s not all that different than Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra.

                Physiognomy is actually true – to an extent. Or do you think that Down’s Syndrome is merely a cosmetic condition? You may be thinking of phrenology?A bit more light-hearted take is from Nietzsche:The anthropologists among the criminologists tell us that the typical criminal is ugly: monstrum in fronte, monstrum in animo. But the criminal is a decadent. Was Socrates a typical criminal? At least that would not be contradicted by the famous judgment of the physiognomist which sounded so offensive to the friends of Socrates. A foreigner who knew about faces once passed through Athens and told Socrates to his face that he was a monstrum — that he harbored in himself all the bad vices and appetites. And Socrates merely answered: “You know me, sir!”…When the physiognomist had revealed to Socrates who he was — a cave of bad appetites — the great master of irony let slip another word which is the key to his character. “This is true,” he said, “but I mastered them all.”— fromTwilight of the Idols

                PFC Roland L. Bragg is a White guy from Maine who won a Silver Star and Purple Heart in the Battle of the Bulge. He stole a German ambulance and drove his wounded buddy to a hospital, saving his buddy’s life. He had previously been considered as the fort’s namesake:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_L._Bragg
This is a decent move on Hegseth’s part. Going back to Braxton would’ve given the Left an easy rallying point and would’ve guaranteed another name change when the Left retakes the WH.

        Not disagreeing… but yes and no, Z.(Greetings, fellow white nationalists and dissidents!)  🙂As far as the militarization goes – sorry. If you are going up against cartels, organized crime, terrorists or even a fortified crack lab – those guys have the hardware. That is not a job for a G Man with a 38 snub nosed revolver. Times have changed, and the bad guys have too. You can argue whether or not those kinds of tactical scenarios fall into their mission scope and make an argument. But whoever ends up going up against those guys  needs the same equipment they have. You ARE correct that if they are going to do those kinds of things – they HAVE to be trained on levels suitable for your average SEALs or elite military units. You don’t want to send computer geeks girl bosses and accountants into stuff like that.I also disagree with the PT. Their mission is to fight crime. If you have some creepy, nerdy zit faced kid calling himself Big Balls – and he is an ace computer sleuth or an aggressive accounting corporate cut throat – sign him up! Park him behind a computer and let him run. Likewise – if you have an old hand in his 50s that’s a patriot with a true gift for the work – don’t throw him out! Who’s that immigration hard ass? Hohman? You need hundreds more just like him.The problem is our politicos are crooks and thieves and they can’t afford a dedicated law enforcement  body or they’d all wind up behind bars. Even if your ideas were all magic bullets that would solve the problems, 100%… they are useless unless you can clean out the dumpster fire that is the American judiciary… and we have that problem even worse up here in Canada.If you want the best crime fighters you can get, you have to pay them, reward them, train them and furnish them with the right tools for the job – and actually PUNISH the corrupt.

That happens only on television. The FBI does not go up against cartels or organized crime. As far as terrorists or fortified crack labs, they can rely on local police for these things.

                It’s conspicuously absent on TV for a reason. When it happens for real, it often gets squashed because the perps are the wrong color, or a member of the Blob might attract attention, or the killer was a jew or a troon.And a lot of it is psychological tactics too. If I kick down your door dressed in a muted 3 piece suit and my .38, you might well be tempted to take your chances with me. If five guys in black body armour, riot shields and MP5’s burst in… you are much more likely to put your hands up and surrender.The reason those crack houses and meth labs operate is because they are heavily defended and the cops are rightly afraid to bust them.

                    Read your own link. They were not outgunned, except arguably for the semi-auto 5.56. FEEBs outnumbered them 8-2, at point blank. The bad guys had 12 pistol rounds between them. The FBI had 45 rounds of just 9mm, and there was at least one spare mag used. The good guys also had 12 rounds in 357 magnum, and they had two 12 gauge shotguns. The bad guys fired one round of #6 bird, the good guys, 6 rounds of 00 buck.
They lied about being outgunned. Of course they did.
Interestingly both bad guys had been MPs…

            The problem is FAR greater than simply our elected officials or corrupt judiciary. The ROOT of the problem is universal suffrage. When *everybody* can vote, then *everything* necessarily becomes political, and civil society is cast aside in favor of political society, which in turn *necessitates* the outright *purchase* of bloc votes. Then, “the personal is political.”A straight-as-an-arrow line runs directly from universal suffrage to where we are today. And an equally straight lime runs from the now-discredited ideals of the so-called “Enlightenment” to universal suffrage.One of the shrewdest observers of America ever to write down his observations was Alexis de Tocqueville, who said that the day would come when Americans would consciously, deliberately choose equality over liberty.And he was right.

Many Would argue that their core initial function under J. Edgar Hoover was, in fact, gathering intelligence for political blackmail and power. I don’t think they’ve gone too far off those rails.

        Break it up. Fire all the agents. Reconstitute something for white-collar crime only, including against white collar criminals operating out of Nigeria, India, Philipines, etc. If lone eagles on the internet can penetrate these rings (and they are already doing this successfully), then a federal agency should be able to do the same but with muscle.

            Even as a critic of the FBI, it’s not like they don’t do any good work.  They do a lot of the investigation and prosecution of the kiddie stuff for example.  They bring expertise to local PDs that don’t have the expertise.  They make their labs available to local PDs for testing of evidence and other areas of expertise.  There is even cooperation between American and Canadian cops and labs.  Canada has equipment for getting fingerprints off of smooth plastic surfaces, like trash bags which America does not have.How the FBI can be reformed I have no clue.  They are corrupt from the top and have been for many decades.  Hoover was famously corrupt and politicized the FBI. He ran it for so long (like 50 years) that the corruption was part of the DNA of the FBI by the time he left.Plus, I think there is a level of corruption that is inherent in policing.  You get the “we’re the good guys” attitude and the public are the “bad guys” and so anything is OK.  The ends justify the means type thing.  You get this environment of “officer safety” that rises above all other considerations.It is a crime to record an FBI agent without their consent.  They will NEVER under any circumstance allow recordings of their interviews.  Their written record is the only record and they write their records in a way most favorable to them.  Then, they hand you 50 pages of writing and make you sign it, which basically says “I have read this document and agree it is an accurate representation of what I said” (paraphrasing here).  This is why simply talking to the FBI can land a 100% innocent person in prison for years for lying to them.

                Then, they hand you 50 pages of writing and make you sign itHow do they make you sign it? By threats I imagine.Out of the blue someone once told me this story how they had cold-bloodedly murdered someone. I guess they thought I would be sympathetic because of my background because I hadn’t given them any other reason to think that I would condone such a thing. I won’t go into the details but I will say that if true it would have been adjudicated as a Federal crime. This was back in the 1970s but the crime had supposedly been committed 30 years prior. I fantasized about going to the FBI with this story. At that time I was really naive but I wasn’t that naive. Meaning no way in hell would I ever voluntarily walk into an FBI office for any reason. I’ve rationalized it ever since as well, that guy was just making up a wild story and I think that’s most likely the truth of it, I don’t have time for junior G-man shit like that..

                    The same way they get people to talk to them right after saying “everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law ……. and you have the right to STFU”Nobody ShutsTFU.  Maybe 1 in 40 people takes the advice and just says “I need a lawyer,  I have no statements to make at this time”It is truly amazing how many people just cannot keep their big traps shut.  Many of them have been through the system multiple times and have had their statements used against them.  They’ve had lawyers tell them never to talk to the police under any circumstances.  They just cannot help themselves.Think about it….  If they had any sense, they would have never made a statement in the first place.

                        People do get convicted of crimes they didn’t commit. If you have any reason at all to think you may become a potential suspect, you should proceed with extreme caution when talking to the police. This will be long before they read you your Miranda rights.

                            Yes, they do.  Usually it’s because they spoke to the police.  If you are detained and they want to ask specific questions, they will almost always mirandize you right on the spot.Really, you should not talk to the police under any circumstances.  JonBenét Ramsey’s parents called the police then their lawyer and it is the only reason they didn’t die in prison for the murder of their own child.  It took years and years to officially clear them.  This is the single worst and most stressful hour of your life. Nothing will ever compare (your child has been kidnapped or worse, you find the body).  How easy is it under this kind of stress to mis-remember minor details?Even the most innocent things you say to the cops can later come back to bite you.  Forgetting minor details can later look like deception.  Filling in those details later on when your head is clear becomes you changing your story to fit the evidence.

        I was living in the Bay Area (early 70’s) when the Zebra Killer was runnin’ loose. I had moved across the Bridge from Sausalito into the City. I hadn’t been in my new digs a week when early one evening I answered an unexpected knock on my door and opened it to face an FBI badge held front &amp; center by a man in a well-tailored suit. I took his point immediately before he said a word. He went ahead and explained they were checking all the new residents in the area, looking for the so-called Zebra Killer who turned out to be a crew of four working together in a spree of cold-blooded murder. The way that FBI agent presented his badge was no threat but no-nonsense. He gave me his name, the reason for his call and had me sized up in 10 seconds or less. He excused himself for the interruption and was gone in less than a minute. Professional, conscientious, polite. Impressive and reassuring.
