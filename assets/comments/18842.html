        “At some point, the white population in these countries will not be able to carry the non-white population. The social welfare system will collapse. At that point, nature takes over. These people are not built for living in the harsh north on their own. A great cull is building toward the end of this century…”Would that I was a newborn infant today. I would love to live long enough to see the terror and resentment on the faces of grandchildren just being born today who would curse their ancestors and shake their fist at the heavens. Why?! Why did you take something close to utopia and burn it down to its foundation because you could? Why did you take what is arguably the apex of genetic stock the 300,000 year (Neanderthal and other northern hominid DNA was ‘out of africa’ a full 300K years prior and it shows)in the making nordic bloodline and reverse 300K years of evolutionary fitness in half a century? Why did you destroy my birthright? I would be -really- angry if I was just being born into this cratering dysgenic civilization.As Z said, it would be an entirely different matter if the bioweapon was already existing as in the case of the US obsolete farming equipment. But to –actively– import a weaponized 70 IQ bioweapon / virus is unforgivable. I have to think that a century of avoiding most of the bitter harvest of war and suffering simply made people forget what true hardship really looks like for these Scandi countries. Well, their progeny two generations removed will see suffering incalculable due to the utter folly of their currently ruling grandparents. Sins of the father, and all that, innit? It is cosmically sad I think no matter how you look at it.

            Well, I’m not a newborn but I’m in my early 20s… I feel that way. Not terrified for myself, but certainly others will be terrified who have no clue about what’s going on.
Things are still good enough that you can escape the tax to a reasonable level. Eventually we will end up like Illnois, though.

            You are not angry now?
BAP says; “They’re stiff and constrained because, in short, they live in utter fear, fear that they will lose something. They have very little to lose, but they live in this fear anyway and this is why when there is a question of potential gain or, worse for them, potential loss, they react with desperation, they freeze in terror and hyperventilate.”
This is why nobody does anything.

            As a newborn infant today, your name would most likely be Mohammad. The white liberals throwing away their ancestors’ civilization have very few grandchildren, which is why they don’t care.
This is the natural and necessary process of purging the white genome of all susceptibility to liberal ideas. In a hundred years the only white men left will be the sort who treat white women as property and shoot diversity on sight.
Liberalism will die and stay dead because the only environment it can survive in is an ethnically homogeneous society with no birth control.

            The 1965 immigration act destroyed americas future.  We shake our fists at the boomers and their parents, but they make excuses, and when i say “we,” its the silent majority who are dismissed as ignorant racists, etc.  No one learns from history, except for the dictators.

                “Failing to learn from history” is a lazy cope for the limp-wristed. You can learn anything you want, practically whenever you want. So what? Do something with it. *That* is what matters.

        I visited Norway 25 years ago, and even then, the area around the Oslo Central Train Station was “sketchy.”  The immigration train had started rolling and even though locals hated the vibrancy they seemed weirdly resigned to it.  Through a friend of a friend I met a government Ombudsman (woman) that specialized in welfare claims.  At the time she was dealing primarily with the heritage population.When I asked about welfare fraud, she seemed genuinely shocked, actually offended that someone would fraud the system. Her innocence was movingly sweet.  I started to mention the increasing vibrancy and an inevitable tax on the system.  She went into “typical racist American mode” and we never finished the conversation.I wonder where she is now?

            Yup, sales people and politicians (but I repeat myself) know it is all about framing the conversation to limit and steer the choices.  High trust cultures buy the frames offered to them.  To Z’s comment above, the frame everywhere in the west is that voting works, and is what to do.  That poor lady bought into a very bogus frame.  The world was shifting under her feet, and she couldn’t see it.  Detecting the shifts and responding correctly to them is the challenge for all of us.

        I lived in Stockholm…hmmm, nine years ago now for 2 years. I lived directly in the city center in an area called Vasastan. It was literal heaven. Slow, leisurely and safe but with a touch more Americana that other Euro cities. (I guess that’s why they call it Europe on safety wheel or something like that)At that time, the city center was reserved for native Swedes and expats. You had to travel into certain suburbs to feel the diversity. I knew all about what was happeing because I read stuff like this but honestly, in those two years, I rarely saw Muslims unless I went into Kista where my husband worked.In fact, one night, I went into the McDonalds in Kista –the place was packed, standing room only. I was the only white person in the place. Certainly the only blonde woman not in cover.When we first settled, I noticed all the Swedes just let their kids travel the rails unchaperoned. As a neurotic American, I was a little shocked. Six months in, I was doing the same. I’d send my daughter on the train, sometimes, to her ballet lessons or let them shop and eat in the city with friends.I used to just imagine what the magic of 1970s Sweden must have been like. Even then there was such an innocence. A beautiful culture, it just angers me to no end that it’s been given away.

            I spent significant amounts of time in Malmo in the late 90s, before the diversity really took hold. It was a lovely city, safe to walk about at all hours of the day/night. What happened there is a terrible shame.Even back then Sweden was suffering the impact of population decline because most people did not marry or have kids, and those who did had only one or two. Real estate prices were dropping because, in addition to economic factors, the population was declining so there was simply nobody to buy existing houses, much less to drive the need for new housing. I used to joke with my Swedish friends that they should turn southern Sweden into a summer destination for retired Americans from the Southwest. They scoffed at this notion and instead imported third world Muslims. Error.

                The root of the problem here is – as you point out – the inability of all of these white Western countries to have even enough children to replace themselves.
Maybe instead of incessantly harping on the side effects of that – more time ought to be spent on the ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

                “…population decline because most people did not marry or have kids, and those who did had only one or two.”
Are fewer kids then the real cost of New Deal or postwar ‘socialism’, state safety nets?
Social Security allowed the kids to leave the farm, as they no longer had to take care of Ma and Pa.
(In Europe, the men were dead, so the State stepped in as provider.)
————–Edit: fewer White kids.Other peoples are rabbits.

                If you have spent significant time in Europe and you are an observer, you will agree with this statement.
What killed Europe was addiction to leisure.
There is no level of abuse or indignity that (the average) European will not withstand to ensure their leisure time goes on unabated.
The lack of children is a symptom of their addiction to leisure. It was an expense that would have interfered with the welfare state that enabled the leisure, at least in the short term.
We don’t even have that excuse.

            I feel the same way about growing up in the 1950s in rural upstate NY. When I was ten I hitchhiked all the time to my friend’s house. No one thought anything of it. Quiet, not too prosperous small town nearby. No crime, unlocked doors…

        Well, I guess I have to gush a little. This is one of the best articles I’ve read in a long time. I grew up reading magazines back when those were worth reading, but obviously quality has slipped across the board. Thank you Z-man, you just got yourself a subscriber. Bye the way, thank the guys over at Myth of the Twentieth Century, without them I would never have heard of you.

        It’s not only the rulers of Sweden suiciding their people, but also the people allowing themselves to be suicided.  I suspect that happened because a people with high trust in their leaders were betrayed by them, and the change was so quick and complete that the people of Sweden never knew what hit them, until it was too late.  High trust societies are more easy for leadership to betray, and that is one of the few advantages in having our society move into a low trust one.  Not that moving to a low trust society has done us any real good yet, other than for perhaps our more easily identifying the problem.

            There’s an excellent review of Kevin MacDonald’s new book about the European peoples.  It touches on this subject.
The Nordic countries have a higher percentage of hunter-gather DNA. They are characterized as being more individualistic and moral than the Indo-Europeans.  The Nordics are more prone to engage in “altruistic punishment” than are the Indo-Europeans who had a less individualistic social structure that revolved around a tripartite structure: warriors, priest, merchants. The English Civil War and the Colony of Massachusetts have given the hunter-gathers the upper hand…
It’s a good read:

            The problem is the same all over the Western world, it’s not particular to Sweden. When all Western countries make the same suicidal mistake, looking for explanations on the level of the individual state or people is the wrong focal length; you must zoom out and study the wider picture.

        I intend to read the new Kevin MacDonald book about why whites have a tendency to pathological altruism.  But have always found Whiskey’s (Whiskey’s Place) argument interesting: deprive women of strong masculine figures from their own society and they will import those men from other cultures, even at personal risk and the obvious signs of societal deterioration.  It’s probably not the entire explanation, but it is a hypothesis that has substantial empirical support.  Unless and until patriarchy is reinstituted and women’s influence brought under control, the demographic replacement will continue.

            Almost everything we talk about here has its roots in the feminization of society. I actually think that if somehow Western society reversed course on immigration the demagogues who pander to women would soon invent some new madness to get them all clucking over that would be just as suicidal. I expect it would take the form of some new and extreme form of climate change hysteria that would institute a kind of Soviet style “minder” program where green commissars would be placed in every institution and given vast coercive powers. Meanwhile China and India would laugh and build up their militaries. Eventually they would just annex vast parts of what used to be Western nations knowing their disarmed and cucked populations would have nothing to stop them with. I imagine Australia going under the Chinese boot would be the first domino in that chain to fall. If women’s role in politics and decision making in general is not drastically rolled back advanced Western civilization on this planet will be gone in 100 years.

        The consequences of vibrancy will take generations to play out. Diversity and white guilt are religious beliefs. To reject them is to become a heretic and be driven from the mainstream of society.Look at South Africa. Middle Class and higher whites in cities adapt and  virtue signal about doing so. They gladly sacrifice the working class and rural population.Good whites will continue to be willing to believe the lies that enable them to stay good whites. As long as there are good paying jobs in it, the government will have no problem getting enough whites to prevent bad whites from disrupting the decline.What happens at the end of this is anyone’s guess. Only thing that is certain is that it won’t be the fairy tale happy ending the Dissident Right dreams about. It will be a religious war for good whites not an economic one.

        In fact, red is a very popular color, which suggests something in the ground that was useful for paint, but only comes in red.
Ferrous oxide. Very cheap, anti-fungal properties. Traditional for barns in America too, I believe.

            Paint was traditionally very expensive.  And yes, we had a red horse/cow and sheep barns on the old family homestead.  One reason “whitewash” was traditionally used.  In places like Nantucket, having a painted clapboard front on your house that required paint was a “show of wealth”.   This was before Mercedes and Land Rovers….

            The anti-fungal property piece of that is probably important.  In an environment where the temps never get hot enough to really burn all the crud off the roof – the layer of dirt and organic matter that can build up on a roof over a relatively short period of time can lead to moss and fungi and other crap growing into the roof and destroying it.Around here (New England) – roofers often put a strip of copper along the peak of the roof. The copper leaches down and kills off the fungus and other crap that tends to grow into the asphalt shingles that are typically used on roofs in this region.

        Brunhost sounds a lot like gjetost (which is scrumptious.)  I don’t know why butter in some European countries is so much better than what we get in shops States-side, but it is.   Must be the “terroir”  or contented cows or something.   Glad you’re having a good time.   I really enjoy these travelogues.

            I wonder if it is pasteurization. We boil our dairy, while many European countries do not. The cheese here is better too. Not by a lot, but brighter, if that makes any sense. I’m not a cheese snob, so I could be just suffering from holiday stimulation. When on adventure, everything seems better.

                European butters often include cultures, as cheeses do, for flavor (you might even call it “vibrancy fueled by diversity” 😉).  American butter generally does not.  Also different cultures used in different regions make for different flavors.  The pasteurization thing we do does kind of kill the opportunity for introducing live cultures.  From the Repository of Useless Information, but you did ask 🙂

                    I also theorize that our milk and butter regulation here has something ( a lot) to do with the FDA, even on the French or Irish butters that are imported, such that the “brightness“ of flavor is not allowed to be imported.I think it has to do with a lot of factors, like Dutch said: the cultures from the milk. And also, the cows themselves, and the terroir, like someone above also mentioned.And the grass they eat, the fact that these countries and regions are smaller, and can also have more of an artisan process to create such amazing butter.Even butter from the Canucks is better than in the US, and I put it down to all those things, plus again, FDA regulation.It’s odd that I have thought a lot about this. But as someone who has been traveling to Europe for many years (mostly France and DE) I have wondered about this for a long time.And I also brought back quite a few frozen blocks of French butter to savor at home, long after the trip was complete.

                As a Midwestern farm kid who grew up working on a dairy farm, I can pitch in with some expertise here. The best milk comes from healthy, grass fed cows and is unprocessed, or minimally processed. I grew up drinking unprocessed milk straight from the bulk tank, which is a huge, refrigerated stainless steel tank. I can’t drink store-bought milk.Modern American dairy products suck because the cows on large dairy operations are fed mostly grain and are confined in feed lots or small pastures, so the raw product is low-quality milk. That low-quality milk is then pasteurized using a modern pasteurization process that heats the milk to approximately 170 degrees, which denatures the proteins in the milk. As if that’s not enough damage, the milk is homogenized, which removes fat content from the milk. The end product is basically water with a whitish tint to it. Yuck.I still have fond memories of the barn cats who learned to stand on two legs with their mouths open to allow me to squirt a line of milk into their mouths when removing the milking machine from a cow. It was a charmed, magical life.

        I got hooked on this youtube channel called Bald and Bankrupt which is a British ex-pat mostly going through various big and ultra rural cities of Russia, Belarus and the like. Many paint their buildings and even houses in somewhat garish colors. I assumed it was to take the dullness of the landscape out of it.

        Zman-I was similarly disappointed in Oslo. It is clearly a major hub for implementation of the globalist agenda.What I found most depressing about Oslo was the downtown area with 8 or 10 large structures that look like enormous, black parking decks. They are similar in appearance to the equally depressing terminal structures located in the US national disasters known as JFK and LAX airports. In Oslo these structures seemed to be mixed use retail/office/residential space.I don’t know if you had the opportunity, or will have the opportunity, but I highly recommend visiting the smaller Norwegian cities of Bergen, Stavanger, and Trondheim. All of them have their own unique character, and all have easy access to Norway’s natural beauty. I found the transit system easy enough that I was able to reach all of them via train or bus.I found Norwegian women far, far better looking than Swedish women. Far more slender, blonde, and fit. I did not notice many blondes in Sweden, and I found most of the women there to have pear-shaped figures. I won’t comment on the miscegenation since I am about to prepare dinner.I stayed at Best Westerns during my time in Norway, and I found the breakfast spreads quite good there. The lack of air conditioning was problematic because the country was experiencing record heat in the mid-80s, and their building are very well-insulated for the typical cold winters.

        Hi Zman,Just listened to the podcast  and you mentioned some analysis done on the Seth Rich execution. Could you link please? You mentioned some college that had completed said analysis. sounds interesting. Those demographic projections for Sweden are shocking, Ireland is much the same. I’m doing the rounds trying to get IRA supporters cornered on the Irish demographic issue, because a MAJOR component of selling the ceasefire in 1994 onward was that the demographic tide of Irish catholics would outvote the Protestants in the ethnoeligious enclave that was Northern Ireland. The average IRA /Sinn Fein member is not too bright but the leadership are hardcore marxists with all of the modern infusions. Anyway, keep up the great work.

            Has there ever been another European country that simultaneously promotes the emigration of its own people and the importation of foreigners while crying “demographic decline?”   I’ve mentioned it before.  As EU members Irish citizens can work throughout the EU.  Paul Ryan’s last hurrah was to secure thousands more visas for his co-ethnics to work in the USA.  I’ll never get it.  What is it that makes the Irish successful everywhere and anywhere except Ireland?  (BTW: All the iterations of the IRA can bite me.  They were willing to blow-up innocent people for a political cause (Ireland for the Irish) they’ve since entirely abandoned in favor of globalism.)

                fair criticisms, I think a lot of the best were forced out during famine and subsequent massive corruption and hereditary dynastical rule from the two main parties created a brain drain. The ‘we emigrated everywhere’ argument is constantly invoked to justify turning Ireland into Mogadishu btw and hard to counter on the spot. Anyway its a huge topic, but the old guard IRA type has no clue how the rest of the world is and are only used to throwing pennies in the poor box for Africa.

To me that seems even more insane than the Swedish situation.  The Swedes didn’t go thru decades of fighting against the British.  To my way of thinking – to go thru all those decades of fighting to gain self governance – only to give it all up just a short amount of time later by importing your replacements is probably the ultimate in insanity.

The second statement is true in many more places than Sweden. But, as for Sweden, and eventually Norway, and eventually…….
What options do they have for escape and evasion? Where will Swedes and Norwegians go when it happens?

            The one advantage the Norwegians have is a huge sovereign wealth fund stuffed with oil money.  Unlike the Arabs, ordering shiploads of Rolls Royces, the dour Norwegians put most of it in the bank.

It’s a variant of the oil curse. Because of their wealth fund, the importation of vibrancy can continue for longer before the welfare state breaks down.

                    Exactly. I have a mate living just outside Oslo who says that exact same thing. He debates a lot of Norgies who literally have bought into the ‘one race, human race, one world, one government’ idea. He asks them how the Chinese feel about this one world government and if it would be one person one vote (we’d be run by a coalition of India and China if so). They then go silent – as it ‘does not compute’. Get hold of media and education and detox the young.

                    Don’t get me wrong…the SWF allows them to keep up the idiocy longer.  The only saving grace might seeing the next door neighbors crater sooner and if the Norwegians decide to make a course correction they won’t have squandered it all on welfare for their little brown brothers. Sort of like the relationship between Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the UAE….the Dubai royal family have always been the spendthrifts, which the original emir in Abu Dhabi was sinking his oil earnings into gold and US Treasuries.

            This is why Detroit is depopulating, but Atlanta is not.  The traditional excuse is “racial tension”, but that hasn’t hurt the population of Atlanta. Really it’s the weather and lack of whitey to keep the cold out.  Nobody to maintain, fix, and or pay for, the HVAC after it’s trashed or allowed to decay.

        Apperantly, this is just scuttlebutt I’ve picked up, Sweden had a healthy eugenics program well past WW2. It was targeted at the strange reindeer people in the North called the Sami. That and they sat WW2 as a major trading partner for the NAZIs. There’s probably a lot to unpack there.

            The oft ignored reason why Sweden was able to experiment with social welfare was the fact that they sat out both WWI and WWII and traded with all sides.  Just look at a GDP graph over the period.  The Swedes came out of WWII fat and happy and with an intact population and industrial base.  Yet it only took them 30 years to burn through the surplus and start retrenching in the 80s.  Now they have simply found a new form of suicide.  Funny, but when you point that out to some Lefty who thinks you can model the largest economy in the world on a place the size of Wisconsin and they just glaze over.

        I was in Gothenburg and Gislaved in May of “15. Gislavid was 20 Km from where i was starting up some equipment for a customer (I am an industrial automation engineer). Gislaved is about 120 Km from Gothenburg and has a population about 10,000 people. It has the only hotel in the area, which is why I was staying there. The hotel is in the center of town next to a plaza. While sitting on the outdoor part of the restaurant in evenings, I saw many Muslim immigrants walk by. Mostly, they were Sub-Saharan Africans rather than Middle Easterners, although I saw both. If Gislaved has such immigrants, then it is likely that all of Sweden is filled with them. downtown Gothemburg is still nice though.This was in May of ’15, right before the recent wave of Syrians and others. I’m sure there are more now.

            Finland is an interesting alternative.  It isn’t yet as vibrant as Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and the impossible-to-learn language and rigorous climate function as barriers.  But there is a vibrant community in Helsinki.  As far as alcolhol is concerned, it is very high priced and there is a strenuous anti-alcoholism campaign in Finland.

        These travelogues are great, Zman. I think it’s because it’s Euro culture and lifestyle filtered through your perspective. Since I’ve been a daily Z reader since 2014 (hat tip to Vanderleun) and have lived in and visited some of these places, it’s great to view, say, Malmö, et al from your perspective.
A book perhaps?

        Incredible character I came across after putting ‘diversity norway’ into the youtube machine. This Indian lady ADMITS ‘with diversity can come a lot of tensions’. Her career is about ”diversity leadership” and she’s speaking to a capitve(in the literal and figurative sense) audience about why less Norwegians is good for the future of Norwegians.
