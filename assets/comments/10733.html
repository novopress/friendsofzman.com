        On diversity…
I have tried IRL Gavin Mcinnes technique of asking people to name one benefit of diversity/multiculturalism/immigration with one caveat: you cant use restaurants as your example.
So far, nobody has come up with anything.

        That which you subsidize, you get more of.
Our affluence and politics is the core reason that we are creating and growing more dead-weight in our society than at any other time in human history. And there is a belief that this will either change magically at some point in the future, or alternately, that it can go on forever without consequence. The sad part is that people are actually happier when they live in a world that necessitates productivity in order to survive and thrive.

        “For reasons I have no interest in knowing, schools now stay in session longer and they start earlier.”I’ll tell you anyway Zman.  🙂 Those poor, tired, over worked and underpaid public school teachers continue to negotiate more time off during the regular school year in their collective bargaining.  Thanksgiving, for example, was always a 4 day weekend when I was a kid.  In our district it has been a full week off for the entire duration of my older daughter’s schooling, so at least 10 years.  Good Friday is now a “teacher institute day”, so the kids are off and the teachers go to the school for a half day of bitching about how tough they have it while eating doughnuts and drinking coffee paid for out of the school’s petty cash, which comes from my property taxes.   These TID’s, and there are at least 7 or 8 of them throughout the year,  always seem to happen on the other side of the weekend from some minor holiday that most people who work in the private sector don’t get off.  So it’s a nice 3 1/2 day weekend for the teachers and an extra day of childcare regular two income families have to shell out for their younger children.

            I’ve found my oldest’s public school teachers to be well-meaning and interested in doing a good job but – you’re right – they hardly ever work.  In California the teacher’s union has a stranglehold on our democracy so I expect little to change unless we go bankrupt.
The kids, even in my UMC public school, are completely un-parented so I guess they’re getting the teaching they deserve.
I’m planning on private schooling or homeschooling.

                Very wise, if you give a damn about your kids that’s the way to go.
My girlfriend is semi-retired as a substitute teacher.  What she tells me about the impossibility of teaching a class, imparting knowledge, when the a class of twenty or thirty have two or three uncivilized thugs (90% of them are black) that prevent any education from happening.And neither she or the school admin can do anything about it.
The teachers are forbidden from saying anything about this problem to the normal parents.

            Airports have become staffed with people who, twenty years ago, couldn’t get a job and who now can’t be fired.It’s all due to that nasty piece of shite George W Bush and the neocon filth he immersed himself in.

        Onward. I look forward to the podcasts.
P.S. “Often, the best way to learn new things is to jump right into them and start figuring it out. ”
I am currently writing a screenplay. Have I ever written one? No. Did I think I could write one? Why not? I read one (Chinatown), bought software and jumped in. Will it get bought and made? Only God knows. Do I care? No. It was something new to do.

            The best screenplays to use to learn the craft are in the book “Three by Richard Price.” Price used to be a great novelist, and he’s done some good work on HBO’s “The Wire” but his screenplays are also aces (“The Color of Money” “Sea of Love” “Mad Dog and Glory”).

            I love the screenplay format so much that the last “decent length” piece I wrote is in it, but let me say, if you plan on “novelizing” it, be prepared to re-do the entire thing. (Or I pray you’re smarter – or more patient – than me, because I couldn’t figure how to put the 8.5×11 Word doc onto a 6×9, etc. paperback size!)

        Enjoy the podcasts, and I hope people listening to it enjoy it as much as you anticipate doing them.I won’t be one of them.I read at nearly 600 wpm; highly trained speakers talk at about 280 wpm, untrained speakers at 180-200, plus the useless filler words, pauses, and re-hashes because they suddenly figured out a better way to say what they’ve been talking about for 10 minutes on a 2 minute topic.I have neither the time nor the patience for that crap. Enough others do, which is probably what drives the burgeoning YouTube and podcast things.Have fun, and I sincerely hope the Pleasures of Podcasting doesn’t prevent the info from appearing here in text.

            I won’t call it crap, but I prefer reading, too. Thing is I have a wine that will say some brilliant and funny things in conversation that he would never think to write down, and by the time he did some of them wouldn’t even be relevant any more. If some of the people who do these podcasts are anything like him they need to be done.

        For the reasons you mentioned, I’ve started avoiding airline travel.  Avis went downhill pretty quickly.  I noticed the same thing and simply stopped using them.  I take an airport bus to and from the airport now.  I can do what I want on the bus and there’s WiFi.I noticed the same thing at the United Counters.  On the East Coast, the baggage handlers and ticket counter clerks are from some West African country.You’d think Avis and United would find their hemorrhage of customers more expensive than paying better wages for Americans, but they don’t.  Some white guy at the top of both organizations is getting stock options for making the numbers look good this quarter!The Americans you see at airports are increasingly Baby Boomers who love diversity because they didn’t have to grow up with it and members of the managerial class.  It’s hilarious how the managerial class aspirants from the third world (who also choke-up the Premier Silver boarding lines) mimic their American counterparts and snicker at the Boomers waddling up and down the terminal.I should probably plan on vacationing in a tent during my Golden Years (if any).

            Great idea, if we could actually trace their country of origin.  That’s (one of) the main reasons behind the (hopefully not) temporary immigration ban: They could actually be from anywhere.
Of course, the obvious answer to my objection is, “OK you can’t document your country of origin.  So you get the default, namely nothing.”  Can you imagine how fast the Prog spenders-of-other-peoples’-money would be in front of a 9th US Circuit judge_?
Lots of prep work needs to be done.

        “….Epsilon Minus sub-class….”
Why I read The Z every day.  The perspective is heads and shoulders above just about anythng else out there, I always get an out-loud LOL or two, and I learn something.  (I gathered what Z was driving at, but did NOT know Epsilon was a reference to Huxley’s BNW.)  Of course I’ve never actually READ the darn thing…just skimmed the Cliff’s notes.

        As a devoted podcast enthusiast I  find that personality and intelligence of the podcaster are the only things that make a podcast listenable. I will put up with poor quality of sound but never with poor quality of content.

        I think Michael Savage offered Mark Levin $100,000 to never get on the radio again. He said his whiny voice sounds like an old Jewish woman having a hysterectomy with no anesthesia, and I personally think that’s being charitable.I can listen to Rush for awhile in the car, but he is (as someone once called it) “B-word” fat. If he pronounces enough words that begin with “B” in sequence, you can hear his jowls banging against each other, which is unpleasant to listen to for too long.Some podcast work better with two people, but I personally like how Derb never has guests on his show, and just does his own thing from his bunker.

        Modern airport management:  Jets hold ~130 passengers, jet-way waiting areas have seating for less than one hundred resulting in more than thirty people standing in the concourse aisle.
It’s hard to believe airport architects are this stupid so this third world chaos is an intentional design feature.
Somewhere we lost our way to Syd Mead’s world.

        In my experience in the LA Basin and Imperial City, its the Asians who are pushing the shorter summers. The managerial class has gotten behind it since as little Johnny reverts to the mean, they see it as their last hope to get him into the right school.

            Parents like to use the local public school as a taxpayer-subsidized daycare.  Increasingly, parents put their kids in after-school care which is basically just daycare from 3-5.  These same parents see summertime as a MAJOR INCONVENIENCE since they have to find alternative daycare for their children that they wish they hadn’t had.  Shortening summers allows parents to use even more taxpayer subsidized daycare.  It doesn’t surprise me Asians have figured out this white yuppie trick and are now doing it on steroids.

        I’m all blacked out too:http://voxday.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-cost-of-black-america.htmlOver the course of an average 79-year lifespan, a white individual contributes a net $220,805 to the system, whereas over the course of an average 75-year lifespan, a black individual receives a net $751,200. However, since there are 4.6 times more whites than blacks in the USA, the black share has to be divided among the various contributors to sort out a one-to-one comparison. So, the net cost to the average White American of the average Black American is $384,109.﻿

        I’m a little late to the thread but funny you should mention car rental at Logan Airport as I rented a car there just three weeks ago. Maybe five years ago they consolidated all the separate companies into one facility. As I breezed through my check-in at Alamo with a black American woman CS agent who was perfectly fine, I noticed that Avis had a horrifically long line. This was on a Monday evening.

        I like to absorb my information by reading rather than listening, however, I drive about an hour a day and usually listen to Podcasts I’ve recorded to CD’s.I’m sure I’m not alone.
FYI a CD contains 79 minutes of audio. If your material runs longer than that you might consider splitting it into two (or three).

        I don’t know if ANY “libertarians” who would make the argument that we should just import more cheap labor – while leaving native born slackers sitting around receiving their government disbursement checks.
You seem to have a dyslexia problem and can’t discern the difference between the word “libertarian” and “liberal”.
