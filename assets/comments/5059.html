        Let’s hope and pray you are wrong but the sad reality is when the takers finally do outnumber the makers, it’s game over.

        As an outsider, I cannot really see what the debate is about when it comes to the 2016 presidential election. As far as I can see — and as I say I utterly in the dark over here — I cannot see the event in November of next year being about anything but how many the Democrats win by. There are too many freebies and nutcases on offer to avoid the inevitability of that.I suppose the early question is who will win enough votes to be the Dem candidate, and it almost doesn’t seem to matter who the Republican is because they won’t win.A lot of me hopes this is wrong but I’d welcome some clarification that there is a point in the two parties ‘going head to head.’

        Eigtheen trillion dollars in debt and counting, and no one in our current crop of spineless politicos is willing to make the hard decisions to address this looming fiscal disaster. Greece is a warning shot that we as a nation must heed. The piper must be paid eventually. One has to wonder how many of the jellyfish who desperatly seek the highest office in the land ever had childhood fantasies about one day being captain of the Titanic.

        Morons, idiots, crooks, liars, thieves, criminals, charlatans,  really stupid folks , etc. have been voting and running for or have held  positions of political power since just after the dinosaurs  became extinct.The difference today is that very substantial segments of the population – who are clueless about economics and our Constitution –  can vote into office lying, two faced, criminals that will reward these voters with the loot (“legally”) stolen – via taxation –  from the productive, hardworking citizenry.This situation did not exist in any significant way until, say, 1960, and it has only gotten worse and worse since then. Crooked politicians and ignorant voters have been around forever, but not that long ago , EVERYBODY knew that they had to find their own way through life to survive because there were NO government freebies.You found a way to make a living or you were up sh*ts creek;  end of story.Our present welfare state  MUST eventually lead to a total breakdown or breakup of our nation, as classes or groups of people are set against other classes by these crooked politicians who seek ONLY election to office. This is how Obama got elected and how, despite her criminal activities, Hillary Clinton, incredibly !!,  still has ample support of many voters. These voters are either too stupid to see she is a fraud and a liar, or know full well that she is, but hope to personally gain from her election.Greece and Venezuela are  bankrupt because their politicians promised  (lied to) the voters they could get something for nothing and eventually the piper demanded payment.The USA is heading in that same direction.One group of voters really , really believes that you can get something for nothing, and the politicians who promise this gift do not care that it MUST ULTIMATELY DESTROY this nation.Chief Justice Marshall said: “….. and That the power to tax involves the power to destroy [is] not to be denied .”Greece and Venezuela are just a preview of the future.

        I know that Crazy Joe takes a lot of well-deserved grief, but in truth we could do a lot worse.  For starters I don’t believe that the man loathes and despises the country like our current Preznit does.  Neither is he a hate-filled vindictive shrew with a 50 year long list of scores to start settling once the oath is administered.  All in all, if we’re going to be stuck with another Dem in 2016 (as we surely will once ¡Yeb! gets handed the nomination) I rather it be Crazy Joe than Cankles.

        Tis a thing to be desired. Would it be a mortal sin to wish for it too much?
