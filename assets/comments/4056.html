        Well there’s always sexism, ageism, income inequality, environmental justice, etc.  Oh they will always find new causes or recycle old ones – in perpetuity.

            I get the sense that most of the social justice types really don’t care about the dictionary meanings. Their concern is with signalling to the other lunatics that are down with the cause. They are speaking in tongues.
