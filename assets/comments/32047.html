        I have no ethical, religious, moral or sentimental attachment to capitalism. Yet I have to acknowledge it is usually the most successful economic system because it is realistic about people’s weaknesses and strengths. Then something like the Harpers Ferry story appears and reminds me that capitalism is woefully inadequate to deal with the weaknesses and strengths at times.The Harpers Ferry carve-out also reveals something painfully true about so-called “Red States.” The Republicans who run them are greedy and venal and more than willing to usurp local autonomy and transfer it to the state when money is involved. It doesn’t really matter if the state is poor like West Virginia or wealthy like Texas. In fact, there is some chance, albeit a minute one, this would not have happened in a Blue State. The most galling aspect is the GOP mouths slogans about federalism and will push it aside immediately when the stakes get high enough. Democrats hate the concept of federalism and while they might usurp local control to build migrants camps, child tranny surgery centers or whatever, they will do so as an exercise of raw power and not bother with a rationale.Mass migration, in fact, is very similar to what happened with Red Lobster and Harpers Ferry. The desire for cheap labor and new voters, two sides of the same coin, overrode the social concerns of citizens. The newer form, of course, is about the Great Replacement, but greed still underpins it.To contort the words of a man loved by vulture capitalists most of the time, you can have either financialization or socially compatible capitalism. Choose one.

            Nobody feels like they have any skin in the game, as they say. In this case, the game is the welfare of the people, and a nation run by foreigners, unmarried hags, sodomites, Jews, and the hyper-violent underclass cannot possibly give a damn about the nation.
It is the reason why other models of social organization are almost aways to be preferred, though the American mind rebels against conceiving anything like an alternative. Sad, but many such cases.

                Those Red State politicians I referenced almost all are straight white males and they have no less compunction about screwing over their own people than the alien elites/zoo freaks. It ultimately is the system is fatally flawed, in part due to how it predictably evolved.

                    When you are in a bust-out phase, there is no option except to behave as if you are in a bust-out phase. You see where I’m going with this, I trust.

If you base your business on solid principles and avoid debt, it’s pretty hard for the banksters to exploit you.
You still face the problem cited here, where government refuses to protect citizens’ property rights. Don’t know what you can do about that except maybe don’t let those “investors” get their foot in the door in the first place.

                            Boycott, boycott, boycott, too. E.g. look for Mom &amp; Pop restaurants when on the road and avoid the corporate slop-monsters.

                                Absolutely. They took a hit, often fatal, during Covid but those diners are on the rise as fast food is on the way down now. People will eat actual food whenever the herd can’t stampede to some McVomit place.

                                    The price has gotten too high. Somebody posted a picture of a receipt from five guys. Two burgers, one large fry and two drinks almost 40 bucks.

                                            I admit to liking the sausage macmuffin with egg, and MacD’s coffee. When on the road I’ll buy their 2 for $5 deal on the sandwiches, pay $1.39 for their medium coffee (vs 3.49 at Dunkin’), saving the second macmuffin for a late morning snack or even lunch. I am not trying to defend MacDonalds per se or deny that inflation in meals isn’t real. Just reporting the facts as I experience them.As for a real sit-down breakfast at our favorite local family restaurant, my wife and I now pay $40 for what I consider to be a $20-25 breakfast (omelets, homefries, some bacon and toast, coffee, etc.) Plus the gratuity is now “understood” to be 20% rather than the traditional 15%.

                                            When I was in high school in the mid /late 80s the father of  a  girl in my class owned a bunch of McDonald. Her house was in the newer boars head club rather than the old money Farmington. She had Ms Pac-Man like Ricky Schroeder but there was this bowl of coupons for Big Macs. We would grab a handful on our way out . Machiavelli says that men don’t know if their times are really better or worse that olden times. He hoped that he was not misjudging when he claims that his times worse than Ancient Rome.but those were sweet Big Macs!

                                The iron rule of economic life in AINO is, “the bigger, the worse.” What I mean by that is that the larger the business/corporation, the more evil it is.The reason this is true is that once a small business becomes successful enough to get on Wall Street’s radar, the Manhattan vampires show up and money-whip generally wholesome and decent owners into selling. Once that happens, the business in question becomes a part of AINO’s power structure with all the depravity, deceitfulness and criminality that entails.This being the case, when you have an option to do business with companies of different size, go with the smaller one, even it costs you a bit more. Try to withhold every farthing you can from the bloody maw of corporate AINO.

                                    It’s pretty funny how often their model fails. We had a beloved grocery chain here called Big Bear. It was a regular supermarket, but more along the lines of target. They were known for having the best meat, they even have their own cattle farm.East coast banksters bought it and sold off everything that made Big Bear successful and jacked up prices to East Coast levels. (East Coast pricing does not work in the Midwest.) I forget how many years they were able to string it along, but eventually they had to shut the chain down.But I’m sure they got their money out in management fees or whatever else they’re able to pull out of this companies. Same people also destroyed Grand Union, another grocery chain.In fairness, I didn’t seem like Big Bear was very profitable. They were profitable, but it didn’t seem like they were breaking any records.

If you pay your workers well, sell high quality goods at reasonable prices, and avoid ripping off vendors you’re probably NEVER going to be the most profitable. The recipe for a hyper-profitable business is simple – outsource labor and materials costs to the worst turd-world shithole you can find, slow pay or no-pay the vendors, and jack the prices up like they’re a monster truck.

I mean, how hard can it be to not hire employees, buy shit off Ali Baba and Fiverr, and bill the customer at 1000% markup?
I’d buy your book if that worked…

                                    Ostei Kozelskii: “The iron rule of economic life in AINO is, “the bigger, the worse.” What I mean by that is that the larger the business/corporation, the more evil it is. The reason this is true is that once a small business becomes successful enough to get on Wall Street’s radar, the Manhattan vampires show up and money-whip generally wholesome and decent owners into selling. Once that happens, the business in question becomes a part of AINO’s power structure with all the depravity, deceitfulness and criminality that entails.”As a counterexample to your thesis, yesterday Business Insider had a fascinating article about the Mars fambly, and their candy empire:https://www.businessinsider.com/mars-chairman-stephen-badger-reveals-details-about-company-future-2018-5Here’s an article on America’s Largest Private Companies by revenue:https://www.statista.com/chart/23592/largest-private-companies-us/Lots of them are in the German midwest:Cargill, MinnesotaKoch, KansasKohler, WisconsinUline, IllinoisApparently there is a great deal of controversy as to the ackshual numbers involved, but there seems to be a strong consensus that the Walton fambly probably still owns a majority of Walmart.

                            I’m not sure most can avoid debt.  The fact is, most business ventures, including restaurants need a lot of money up front. You need a building, you need to renovate it, you need lots of equipment and you need to start paying staff right in the beginning.  Something like Red Lobster needs even more money because their business is based on lots and lots of Red Lobster restaurants.

                                Absolutely. The economic and financial system is structured in a way that encourages vampires. A decomposing carcass attracts maggots.

                                    There’s a simple answer to that @Arshad. Don’t hop onto the mouse wheel. The vampires work for you if you are a net saver. Once you have enough saved up, go for it.
Assuming you are not near retirement, there should be some major fire sales in the business world over the next few. Be in a position to take advantage of it.
Or go blow your paycheck on rotgut. Your choice.

                                True. I never understand why anyone would go into the restaurant business. The margins are incredibly tight. One bump on the road sees you bankrupt. 250 years ago, restaurants didn’t exist. People ate at home or at friends.

                                    I thought about it very hard, but two things stayed my hand. First, the red tape required for starting a restaurant, even in Texas, is absolutely insane. Second, I don’t like the idea of having to police my own employees, making sure they’re not dipping their duke into the tambourine when they think nobody’s watching. All in all, just not worth the hassle and headaches to me.

                                            Perfect example of capitalism! If people want to take the risk of food poisoning, that’s on them.
Everyone else can look for the license on the wall if he really believes government does an outstanding job on health issues. *Cough* COVID *cough*

I’m not saying the government does the best job, but that’s what we have.  We are subject to all the rules. Pedro shouldn’t even be here, let alone running a restaurant out of his house.
Call it what it is and deport Pedro and his whole damned extended fambly and all his customers and their famblies too..

But why isn’t the problem the business licenses and such in the first place? Is there some benefit obtained by mulcting businessmen for permission to hang out a shingle? How do I as a customer benefit from this system of legalized bribery?
But sure, deport Pedro. Oh, wait. Government isn’t going to do that. They will just clamp down on you.

Out here in the real world, government oversight doesn’t have a great track record. I suspect most inspectors are trying to do a good job, the inspections are just too infrequent to catch anything like a bad batch of seafood. At best you might find some systemic issues.
But if you think the same type who handled COVID so well signifies quality, you are free to look for the paper on the wall/door. If I’d rather have a different, competent certification organization, why won’t you allow that?

Yes, you didn’t take the missus and the kids to Chuck–Cheese three times a week, but there were restaurants.

                                        But there are differences. Taverns focus primarily on drink, and inns focus primarily on rooms and beds. Restaurants, sans accomodations and focusing primarily on meals, are a relatively new thing.

            It seems capitalism ( a market based economy) is a bit like a free society and may only be adequate for a moral society.
The current bugger grandma for gains business environment brought to us via the financialization of the economy can only end in a failed system hallowed out by the bankers.
This will only get worse.

                Both stories are about government intervention, in the Red Lobster, even the idea of creating the legal fiction of a living thing with rights called Red Lobster, LLC or whatever it identifies as, and the Harper’s Ferry story about state preemption of what is legitimately a matter of subsidiarity.
The whole vile financialization story is one government intervention after another with the effect, if not the intent, to destroy traditional America.

Mock it all you like, but unfortunately, once you get on the mouse wheel, that’s pretty close to the truth. That’s when the tax bill is due, that’s when the investors want to see the reports. What happens a year out is still a year away.
It’s not shortsightedness if you are focusing on the most important time horizon for your business. Want to encourage a longer time horizon? Change the system, so incentives align with lower time preference.
Or keep shouting at clouds. Whatever works for you.

                                I agree it would be nice if CEOs of publicly traded firms took a longer view of things. (In a privately held firm, he can. He can afford to Blue Sky things for decades into the future.) But investors are not noted for patience. If you don’t perform this quarter, market cap is going to plunge, and someone else will be CEO within a year’s time anyway.
But not even boards of directors serve any business purpose anymore. It’s all about virtue signaling.

            Ruling structures axiomatically attract people who will game the system for their own benefit. They rarely have any considerations for the downstream effects of those actions. I moved from Idaho (a “good” red state) to Michigan ( a “no-good” bluish state). The level of corruption is about the same. In Idaho it’s the good old boy network of big business and large landowners selling out the population to carpetbagging land speculators. In Michigan it’s corrupt leftists selling out their populations to foreigners for a bite of the grift.The solution is a government structure that severely binds the hands of the administrators of the state. It was the original idea in the U.S., but of course was immediate restructured to benefit those who are in charge of that structure. Inevitable. What the solution to this conundrum is I have no idea. Perhaps it just needs to be burned down occasionally to allow brief periods of actual freedom.

Doesn’t it seem coincidental that every “crisis” calls for a new regulation or tax, to the benefit of (((Progressives)))?

            Jack:  I have to be honest here – I don’t particularly care aboutRed Lobster specifically (last ate there maybe 35 years ago?)  – although I understand how greed and the financialization of social capital undermined it.  But the linked story about Harper’s Ferry was like a kick in the gut.  Local people stripped of any say in how or where they live all so a few people can make a buck.  And always the same excuse “For the schools!  For the firefighters!”  Always the supposed good of the whole while destroying the very folks who make that whole.It also hits close to home – our Ozark property is about four heavily-wooded hilly miles from an official state ‘wilderness area’ established in 1972.  And local people were forced from their land back then under eminent domain.  So a few people made tourist bucks at the cost of other people who lost their land and homes.  And in 2023 some state government hacks with wealthy friends floated the idea of expanding this area and turning it into a ‘national park preserve.”  One of the developers’ models is a national park preserve in . . . West Virginia.In keeping with your comment, it’s not just the Jewish financiers and lawyers who make these travesties possible.  Lots of short-sighted, greedy, selfish White cuckservatards who work hand-in-hand with the financiers and get a big fat payout.  And get applauded by numurrikan voters like Yinching Lin-Chen.My hatred knows no bounds.

                Right. And don’t let it be missed that the principal offender in the Harper’s Ferry atrocity was a Republicunt from Venezuela, one Sen. Patricia Rucker.
I get that is a power the Constitution reserved to the States, but that’s just another reason the Constitution should be abolished before it causes even more destruction.

Flags wave in the wind… sappy music plays…fade to action shot of the candidate doing something ridiculous like driving a tractor or shucking corn. Then the voice-over starts – “Patricia came to the US with only the designer clothes on her back and a small steamer trunk full of gold coins. She started her political career by winning a local election in Harper’s Ferry after her opponent died mysteriously…”
Salt of the earth these people are.

                The principles and interests of cucks always are principal and interest. I also live in an isolated area although the jurisdiction seems counter-intuitive at first blush until you consider the realities of cuckservatism, whichcausesrather than outright promotes diversity and other cancerous outgrowths. That leads to an even quicker hell.
Anyone who thinks Republicans are their friends was sorely disappointed when the truth came out about the Tooth Fairy.

                The Republican Party, top to bottom, markets itself as a Christian business. I think it’s a rare case of truth in advertising. We just have to remember: The purpose of a Christian business is to rip off Christians.
The purpose of the rest of American business/finance isalsoto rip off Christians (statistically average Americans), so the normal people of “red” cities/counties/states get doubly screwed by public/private partnerships, eminent domain, etc.
Democrats pay their voters. Republicans steal from them. Principled!

            I think DEI is mostly a PR distraction. The PE firms don’t give a shit because they have no intentions of holding the business for very long. So they let HR run things, along with the DEI racket, while the PR firms make their money off of sale of the assets.
Of the two problems, DEI and PE driven financialization of the economy, the latter is far worse for the economy. Boeing suffers much more from the latter than the former.

                Excuse my selective elitism here, and I am nominally for the working man, but I think we should let these goyslop diabetes chains fall to predation. Let the diversity microwave meals at home.
I live in an area that’s developing rapidly, so of course every other new building that goes up is an Arby’s or Panda Express. And the drive-through is regularly busy. 95% of these people are trash, and I am paying for their emergency room visits.

                        Mickey Dee’s is always busy when I see it. Personally I’ve seen no slowdown in fast food demand overall. Subway is still busy despite having a horrible cardboard sandwich that was barely tolerable as a $5 footlong, much less a $15 footlong. Frankly I’m surprised that fast food is still going strong, even though it’s not fast and it’s not cheap nourishment.

            I haven’t been to a Red Slobster in about 25 years, so I can’t comment on its dieversification, although I certainly don’t doubt it. What I can say, however, is that Popeye’s chicken certainly fits the mold you describe.Now Popeye’s makes some dam’ fine fried chicken, and I used to eat that stuff with some frequency. However, over time Popeye’s workforce became steadily more nuggrafied with the wholly predictable decline in competence ensuing. It got to the point that they were getting my simple order wrong about half the time. So I said screw it and haven’t been to a Popeye’s for a few years and never will again. Just as importing Hutus is suicidal for any city or country, so too is hiring many of them for any business.

                There are some restaurants where I long ago got used to the idea that your order was pretty much guaranteed to be correct *in quantity*. The workers had a pretty good idea of how heavy the bag needed to be. Exactly what went into it… Well, not so much.

        As someone who has gotten to know a fair amount of people in the investing/finance world (not private equity or hedge funds but guys who have boutique ETFs or managed accounts), my thought has always been what a waste of talent.These guys are exactly the kinds of men who in a different generation would have been the engineers and upper management of companies that made real things and/or fixed things. They would have been developing better products, better ways to configure the factory floor, better quality controls, better distribution systems, etc.Instead, they’re moving numbers around to squeeze an extra ten basis points out of the carry trade. I don’t blame them. The money and freedom is far better where they are – and no DEI meetings. But it is a huge waste of talent.

            It is the same thing in cable programming, which I had occasion to be involved in once upon a time. The intelligence, creativity and all-around human potential that existed below-the-line took me by surprise.Before I encountered them, I thought everyone involved in televsion had to be stupid. This was not the case. In my experience, the only places where stupidity was tolerated was if it was talent or one of the no-show Executive Producers. I would add that the EPs were, as far as I could tell, all Jews.  And they showed up where actual work was taking place for only two reasons: when marquee names was on set or when a cute PA had been hired.

            This is also a fine way of sucking the top men out of every community in America.It used to be there was a major employer or 2 in most towns, often manufacturing.  The top men in the town became upper management and engineering and the bottom men in the town became workers on the production floor. The middle worked the middle of this sector and the service sector in the town.Today, the company town is long gone, the top men move somewhere else and the bottom men either do drugs or sell drugs.  The middle work in healthcare, prisons, policing or some other “service” sector job.  It’s dysfunction writ large.I just pray that one day these bottom men are able to pay back the top men who did this to them and all the middle men who make fun of them.  Though I suppose making fun of them is the only option. To do otherwise is to recognize how this came into being.

                Someone else once pointed this out as well. The average small county seat had three or four banks, a couple of car dealerships and other businesses that were locally based, where people who had roots in the community were involved. With consolidation, all those decentralized positions of authority disappeared.

                    Yes. They ripped the heart and soul out of every town, USA.  Now the main employers (well, source of income) are the dole in some form, drug sales, “healthcare (also the dole),” corporate retail, lawyers of course,  and other low wage stuff.  If the town is lucky, maybe there is a prison they can work in.  All the money is sucked out of the town.  Where before there was a local 5&amp;10, a locally owned gas station, hardware store and other locally owned retail, it’s Family Dollar, maybe a Walmart and Home Depot. A bunch of chain restaurants…Walmart played a huge role in destroying America.  Walmart had an entire program specifically designed to help (force) manufacturers to close US factories and move production overseas.  They were doing this at scale even before China was in the WTO. It started in the late-middle 90s. IDK if it still exists, but there was an article called “The Man Who Said no to Walmart” about the Snapper lawn mower company that went in depth in this. I also saw a documentary about it.The Waltons are second only to the Sacklers in their deserving of punishment. God them help if we are ever in charge.  I have far less contempt for the Rosenbergs.  They sold “their country” (putting aside if they were genuine Americans) out for ideology.  That is far more understandable than someone who is already very rich selling out their country and countrymen for coin.  I hold those who did this in the most contempt above anyone else.

For most engineers pay tops out pretty fast unless they come up with critical patents, a great idea, or start a company.
This is unlike bankers, doctors, and lawyers, where even the mediocre and below average can do quite well.
Pay engineers more like those other groups and the STEM shortage will mostly solve itself.

                    What’s the point of a Ph.D. Engineer? There are not that many research or academic positions.
If I were hiring engineers at the moment (no, I’m not, so don’t send any resumes) I’d think twice about even hiring a Ph.D. for less pay than a B.S., because he obviously knows nothing about optimization, which is kind of the whole point…

            It is very depressing to think about the number of capable, intelligent young men whose vast potential was diverted towards financial engineering and other rent seeking activities for the ultimate benefit of our enemies.  They produce nothing of actual value, don’t improve the national body in any way, but they are rewarded handsomely nonetheless.
The purpose of a system is what it does.

                They would have no jobs otherwise. That’s because of the hollowed-out real economy. It’s not their fault.Many financial engineers would happily take a more productive and satisfying job with half the wage. Those jobs aren’t out there.

        Mitt Romney is one of the vultures and is worth $300 million. He’s the last Establishment Republican the party nominated and remains the media’s paragon GOP politician. No wonder people moved to Trump, who, whatever his failings in business ethics, at least put up real buildings.https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-politicians/republicans/mitt-romney-net-worth/

                I remember back years ago when I still had cable, I would watch Jay Leno’s car show on whatever channel it was on. I always was suspicious of Leno, his nice guy act seemed like a thin veneer over the nasty guy underneath. Anyway, he had Romney on a show showing off some AMC muscle car his son had bought for him. It was a nice example of that era’s cars but he knew nothing about it and it obviously meant nothing to him except it was a thing he owned, no sentimental value as a gift from his son or as an example of a car from his youth or from his father’s company.He came across as barely human in that interview, someone who was trying to act normal but couldn’t pull it off convincingly. He’s the type of guy who sort of makes the case for actual reptilians.

                        Romney is great on the radio. Some of his interviews with Sean Hannity back in 2012 were great. If only he could show that that charisma in other venues. But then again, these consultants also coach these candidates to always play it close to the vest. That’s why they all come across as boring and monotone. I guess people are convinced that this is what the public is looking for in an elected official.

It was a nice example of that era’s cars but he knew nothing about it and it obviously meant nothing to him except it was a thing he owned, no sentimental value as a gift from his son or as an example of a car from his youth or from his father’s company.Irony of irony George Romney was a hard nosed, bottom line focused executive who saved American Motors by cutting the fat and focusing on small, fuel efficient cars. In the late 1950s his strategy paid off and Rambler pushed past Plymouth to take third place in yearly sales after Chevrolet and Ford. He boosted the stock price from $3/share to $90/share when he left the AMC Presidency in 1962.And his replacement Roy Abernethy pissed it all away trying to take on GM, Ford, and Chrysler toe-to-toe, model for model. No way in Hell they were going to do it.Under a guy like Romney AMC could’ve been a niche car maker like Subaru and made bank catering to markets the Big Three and the Japanese couldn’t touch. Too late AMC tried being an American Subaru. Sadly by the early 1980s they went to Renault looking for cash. As I said when Nissan went to Renault in the 2000s, “If you’re going to the French hat in hand for cash, you’re boned.”

                        Sorry, everything is all out of order now. But back when there were far fewer kkk0mments on the thread, it went something like this:Mitt Romney, Sociopath-Hell: ‘I laugh at the phrase “America First.”’Jack Dobson: “A society that encourages a monster like this one richly deserves its fate. The Bolsheviks existed for a reason.”And my question was whether you knew of anyone in the Romanov fambly who had ever laughed at, say, the Serfs, or the Kulaks, in the fashion of a Clit Romney, or a Marie “Let them eat cake” Antoinette.It’s possible that there were such psychopaths amongst the Romanovs, but, if so, I’ve never heard of them.And as Caudill is saying over at G@b,“This really sheds new light on the Bolshevik Revolution if the Tsar was commissioning paintings like this.“https://gab.com/Caudill/posts/112418458590942948The commissioning of that painting would tend to indicate to me that the Romanovs were deeply concerned about the plight of the Serfs &amp; the Kulaks.Which, in turn, would be why the Bolsheviks so despised the Romanovs.From everything I’ve ever read about the Romanovs, they lost the war with World J00ry precisely because they were too nice, too kind, too naive, too thoughtful, too peaceful, too innocent, too patient, too clueless.

                “The Bolsheviks existed for a reason.”Yes!I’ve been a fanatic anti-communist since I read Gulag Archipelago when I was 14-15. However, there is simply no question that healthy societies well-run by their ruling classes do not get successfully infested with communists. Every communist regime that succeeded in taking root was preceded by a government where the ruling class was behaving badly enough so that, when the chips were down, their working classes didn’t have their back.Those who currently rule America deserve to be bayoneted in a forest hut then dumped down a mine shaft far more than the Romanov’s ever did. If a pack of Bolsheviks went for the Romney’s and the McConnell’s and the Grahamesty’s, I would stay on the sideline, laughing, even if I knew I were next. Hell, if they were ethnocentric nationalist communists like the Chinese or Vietnamese, I would join them in the spirit of the perfect is the enemy of the good enough, and nationalist anything is ‘good enough’ when the alternative is any variety of internationalism.

            I was going to bring up Mittens as well after reading Z-man’s post.  Rombleycare’s alleged career as a “capitalist” proved another big tell as to what a bunch of phonies the cucks were and are.  Rombleycare rolls into town with his crew of sharpies and they asset strip businesses – even when those assets are in the form of employee retirement accounts – to give themselves a big payday.  To Con., Inc. this meant he was history’s greatest entrepreneur – our generation’s very own Andrew Carnegie.  When Trump – a man who actually built his wealth by building things and creating real value – came along, he was just a complete failure/blowhard who produced nothing but hot air about his “alleged” fortune.  All of the cuck’s interest in “free-market capitalism” when right out the window when the mean tweets started dropping.

                I take pride in having voted against him twice. I voted for Ted Kennedy over Willard when I lived in Mass, as even a drunken Hibernian murderer is better than Romney.

                    Last 20+ years have been a wake-up call. In 2008 I seriously thought McCain was “America’s Last Hope” to “Save America” from “Communist Manchurian Black Panther” Obama. Then he went to work for Obama and helped found ISIS and the Ukrainian Nazi movement. Ashamed to have voted for him. I should have just sat out 2008.

                        You’d think the mask rip-offs for both Bushes, Romney and McCain would be enough to make the Zero GOP argument. Even Trump — his actual four years in office were virtually nothing of what he promised and a big sloppy kiss to blacks and Jews, so I see no reason to think he’ll do any better a second time around. The only reason he amuses me is that for some reason this ’90s moderate Democrat in Republican clothing makes the left so mad.

                        I actually drove to Reno NV to campaign for McLame, the only time I ever participated in a political campaign, because I knew how much Obummer sucked with his radical background and he was the farthest thing from a racial healer. At least McLame was an American patriot thus sucked less.

After WW2 American car companies had a huge market opportunity so what did they do? They pushed aside the car guys and turned things over to finance. Quality sank and American cars became a joke.Around 1970 my father worked in quality control at a company that made wallboard (now called sheet rock). He was pushed onto early retirement because he refused to pass bad board as mandated unofficially by finance. The company had the brilliant idea of laying off all their salespeople and transferring sales to another product group to save money. Problem was the sales people knew all the problems with the product and in mass went to the top competitor. The company my dad worked for went bankrupt. Before finance took over they were profitable just not as profitable as finance and the board wanted.Of course what happened there is now embedded throughout the whole system. Short term profits are all that matter. That of course is why we gave our supply chain to China.It is also why the chamber of commerce wants to destroy the country by flooding it with cheap labor. Nothing matters besides getting more cash now.

            It’s what I’ve long called “The Storm of Cash.”  Seems to me that it’s the primary engine driving everything in our world now … American’s world, that is, maybe even the entire Western world.

        My favorite Jim Morrison quote was “I want to have my kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames.” Capitalism always ends in monopoly.I don’t know what other economic system we could use, but I think some of the other commenters might be on to something when they talk about the complete lack of morality of the financial class.I think as this country becomes more diverse and more morally degenerate, the only thing that will hold a lid on it will be a large-scale tyranny that makes our present situation look free in comparison. We need to regulate the hell out of Wall Street, but there’s no movement in the ruling class to do such a thing. Just as we will never deal with the nation’s debt until it implodes, our rulers will never do anything to hurt the financial class that bribes them at every opportunity.As for the F-35, it is a classic example of why our procurement system is broken. The airplane is basically a good airframe, but it has too many compromises because it was like the old saying a horse designed by committee, which is a camel. It doesn’t accelerate well because the airframe is so bulky to account for the lift fan for the B-version, which is replacing Harriers for both the Marines and Royal Air Force/Navy.The problem with the DOD is that every program has to be a joint one, even if the services’ requirements are completely different. The old F-111 Aardvark was the first one of these joint airplanes, but the Navy was unable to accept that this bomber could be made into a long-range interceptor.Admiral Thomas Connolly sacrificed his fourth star, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee that “there isn’t enough thrust in Christendom to fix this plane.” The Navy was allowed to cancel its version of the F-111 and build the F-14, which was later killed by Dick Cheney because he hated Grumman and wanted them out of business, which happened a few years later. I’ve always loathed that evil man ever since.And you have the procurement system which incentivizes contractors to come in with these unrealistically low bids. And then you have the customer constantly changing their mind, sending new specifications as the “good idea fairy” keeps churning out chaos.As for the Navy’s stupid ship procurement program, this was an example of the cult of transformationalism, where these wizards of smart thought they could overturn decades of knowledge in how to build and crew warships with these converted ferry boats and weird destroyers the size of a WWII pocket battleship with 155mm guns that are being removed because their guided ammo costs a million bucks a shot. Also, these guns can’t shoot any regular 155mm ammo (the standard size of artillery rounds) because…well…reasons.The Littoral Combat Ship can barely defend itself and the so-called “mission modules” that would’ve allowed a ship to change from a minesweeper to a small corvette to take out enemy ships were found to be unworkable.The Navy leaders threw away the Navy’s previous practice of evolutionary change on its ships and decided to take big technological leaps, something fueled by post-Gulf War arrogance.And now our Navy is the smallest it’s been in decades. And the frigate designed to replace the LCS? The Navy just had to redesign it and now what was supposed to have 85% commonality with the FREMM frigates from France and Italy is now down to 15% and is three years late.

            Capitalism always ends in monopoly.
Only if the business is truly innovative. Rockefeller invested in research and development, and as a result, was able to sell kerosene at 8 cents per gallon when those using inferior methods were breaking even at 30 cents per gallon.
Most of the time it’s not capitalism that ends in monopoly, but corporatism, where some connected person buys up the right government official(s) and they rule for him or against his competitors.
I know, not what the Progressive history books tell you…

Why do you believe with the Marxists and the libertarians that it’s a matter of all or nothing?
We need to regulate the hell out of Wall Street
Nope. That experiment has been run already.
We need to liquidate Wall Street. Abolishing incorporation of all types is the way forward, and to this we need a thorough system of antizionist restrictions upon all of Jacob’s kids and their zombies. They must be excluded from,at minimum, all participation in banking, lawyering, and accounting.

                I would say that the bankers haven’t been regulated at all since they write their own regulations, a classic case of the fox guarding the chicken coop. If you’re a congressman making $130k per year, why wouldn’t you go along with the nice lobbyists from Wall Street with their pre-written “regulations” that preserve their monopolies and freeze out any upstart competitors with excessive compliance costs? There’s little wonder that most people who go to Congress leave their as multi-millionaires.

Bob had the GREAT idea that if cars could utilize a common platform to cut development costs and speed production (nip and tuck the Falcon to make the Mustang, pull and stretch the Falcon to make the mid-size Fairlane, shrink and cut the Lincoln Continental to make a Thunderbird) then surely it would work for an airplane, right?Well, cars don’t need to take off or land on aircraft carriers so there’s a flaw in that logic right there.

            I never got the appeal of Red Lobster. Many moons ago I was on a business trip and the people I was with suggested we go there for a meal. I forget what I ordered, but I remember it was swimming in butter. On the plate was a blog of mashed potatoes sitting in a pool of melted butter.
The thing is, all casual dining is crap food. Olive Garden is a hate crime against Italians. But, people like it because it is a cheap night out usually.

                It ceased to be cheap, too. Inflation hit seafood prices some time back, and after experimenting with shrinkflation and adding chicken dishes and so forth, the company was forced to hike prices to keep afloat. Covid piled on while that was happening to them. Also, after going to the franchise model, the variations between locations became even more pronounced. Further, the locations often were near shopping malls, which have become ghost towns due to diversity and online shopping.

It’s all about the Italian restaurant bidniss (set in New Jersey in 1954), and is funny as hell, although also fairly serious. You’ll also be starvin’ like Marvin when the final frame rolls.

                I suspect it’s a swirling combination of factors:1) Certainly COVID-19 hurt the chain in areas where draconian lockdowns were stupidly yet vigorously enforced. But even where I live Big Blue Dem City finally dropped the charade in 2022. Probably more likely is the more Biden Bucks it takes to go to dinner these days wiped out the folks who couldjustafford it.2) As you say, if youcanafford to go out to eat, you want your purchases to count for something. I won’t go into painful details but theLASTtime The Lovely 🥰 Mrs. and I went to Red Lobster for dinner, now a decade or more ago, the server had to tell her not one, but both of the items she ordered (her original order, then its replacement) were sold out. We cancelled dinner, paid for our drinks, and left for another restaurant with better food and a better stocked kitchen. I can think of multiple family owned restaurants near me that offer better seafood dishes for just a few dollars more than Red Lobster. Sans the butter you complained about.3) As you point out, financial shenanigans work, until they don’t. I think back to the 1980s and Junk Bonds which looked like a PHENOMINAL idea, until they crashed. Man Plans and God Laughs and all that. All these Very Clever Boys and Girls (Hat Tip to Severian for that one) keep the plates spinning until some Bull or Bear rushes in and slaps them off the spinner. So long as the Very Clever Boys and Girls don’t get punished, it’s all good, eh?So, I would suspect, based on what you said, the grift could be kept going until the people who use the criteria “As long as it’s cheap, I’ll eat there” didn’t even have the money to eat there anymore, and the folks that did looked at the offerings and said “Y’know, I’ll spend the $10 – 20 more and get a good meal.”

                    Or the cost of their debt went up.  Why do you think they’ve been holding rates as low as they have for as long as they have?  We broke baby.  Nothing in our “economy” can function at 5%.  Wait until the next time they cut to zero, you gonna see some real inflation then.

                        Agreed. They may have been hit with the double whammy of falling revenues and higher debt service. One of those situations nobody considers until it happens to them.

                                I think many of them thought it would be another decade of 0%. But that is what 2020 was really about, we went out to the world and asked for another decade of 0% and were told to fuck off. Hence covid and everything since. If they could do 0% now they would, but they can’t. Hence turning the dial up to 11 to start a war, be it civil or global.  Why do you think all the news has talked about since the FED started raising was when rates would go back down?  With the fraud market at 40k?  We need lower rates?  Really?

                                    0% is crazytalk. Would you lend a stranger $1,000 with terms that if nothing bad happens, he will pay you $1,000 in 5 years? If something bad happens you get back less or possibly nothing?
The only way that makes any sense is in the deflationary period of, for example, the late 19th century.

                                    The Fed is more of a “pushing on a rope” thing. It’s more accurate to say they follow where the markets lead, not the other way around.
But yes, I agree it was not COVID. But it also wasn’t really the Fed, in this case, either. All the high-powered money Congress was dishing out to everyone it could corrupt had to lead to inflation — less goods produced, more money to buy those goods. The spending under Trump made it inevitable.

                I will say one small thing for Red Slobster. Back in the 70s they made the best dam’ hush puppies on the planet. They were the length of a cigarette but about twice the circumference, and had lots of sage. Totally delish. Alas, they stopped making those hush puppies long ago. Maybe that also factored into their financial woes.

            The quality of the food and service only played a minor role in their demise.  Zman is right about the vulture capital aspect which overwhelms every other factor.  I looked at their menu online and was surprised it wasn’t more expensive. Red Lobster ended up in a bad spot in the market, especially if they were attracting vibrant diners.  The lack of tips and other problems they cause is going to drive away your best wait staff as well.

            15 to 20 years ago it was pretty decent, as such things go.  Somewhere along the way it was like someone closed down the original Red Lobster and opened a chain of like-named restaurants that were just a poor copy of the original.  There has been a lot of that though, everything has been coin-clipped to the point that it is just a half-remembered memory of a better time.

                    The conditioning about capitalism is at the same level as equalitarianism. The difference is that on paper capitalism should work, and sometimes even does, but it requires interventions and regulations that run counter to the myth and even comes up short then. Corporatism is capitalism, and is the inevitable end stage when someone does not ride her on it, and even at then probably gets there.

So do you dispense with the one that produces goods and services (including your daily bread, for those who will otherwise start screaming about materialism) or with the one which seems to have either orchestrated where we are now or was powerless to prevent it?

                        Most of our lives we’ve tried anarchy, and it almost always works. If your neighbor wants to borrow your chainsaw, he asks, you decide, and that’s it. You can live peacefully regardless of the answer.
The problem is when he appeals to “authorities” to make you lend him the chainsaw. One side or the other is leaving unhappy with the decision, with or without justification.
Riffing off Clinton, it’s the authorities, stupid.

Capitalism, in addition to its other faults voluminously enumerated above, annihilates culture, tradition and aesthetics. Everything falls before the diktats of the profit margin. And the capitalist society becomes etiolated, shallow, vulgar and nihilistic. Unchecked capitalism does all that. It is every bit as totalizing as communism.

Depending on your definition, we might be in agreement. I, too, would despise a system which did that. *Cough* socialism *cough*.

                                Capitalism as unchecked, unregulated free enterprise. Any society defined, in large measure, by its adherence to this system, will eventually be transmogrified into something grotesque and hideous, and then bulldozed into a trench. America was thus warped and is now in the process of being razed.

The most effective check on free enterprise is people not buying your product. The most effective “regulation” is people not buying your product unless you meet their standards. In other words, capitalism.

OK, agree to disagree, I guess. I’m not seeing how society would be better if I were compelled to buy or not buy a certain lawnmower, at the whim of some authority figure.
If a guy wants Rocky Road, let him buy Rocky Road, for pete’s sake, and society can go screw.
Now granted, externalities, but is there a single larger externality than AINO?

                                                Of what good is total freedom of choice when it leads to the terrible society? This reification of principle at the expense of pragmatism is what ruined the Right in America. I’ve seen the results of capitalism, and they leave much to be desired. Now having said that, I’m not opposed to capitalism per se. I simply prefer that it be carefully managed rather than left to its own destructive devices. The libertarian model is not for me.

                            Ostei Kozelskii: “Capitalism, in addition to its other faults voluminously enumerated above, annihilates culture, tradition and aesthetics.”I would argue that it’s not capitalism, but rather j00ry, to include the j00ish monopoly on all forms of media [jewspapers, j00vies, talmudvision channels, scr0tial media websites, to include j00ish pr0n], plus of course the j00ish monopoly on distributing the fiat shekels emanating from the Federal Reserve, which altogether is what“annihilates culture, tradition and aesthetics”.Back circa 1875-1900, when ackshual White Christians were still the captains of industry in this nation, I don’t know of anyone*** who promoted the annihilation of culture nor tradition nor aesthetics.Annihilation of culture &amp; tradition &amp; aesthetics is an almost purely j00ish pasttime.===============[***With the possible exception of s0d0mites such as John Milton Cage &amp; Merce Cunningham.][I have mixed feelings about John Singer Sargent &amp; Thomas Eakins.]But it’s been a full century now of j00ish dominance of the “culture, tradition and aesthetics”..

                            Ostei:  Thank you – my husband said to tell you that he knows he married a smart woman.  And Steve, I did marry a smart man. But neither of us is always right.  In this instance, without giving away too much personal information, I understand my husband’s point of view because that’s what he does all day – he’s involved in multiple, individual commercial transactions daily.  He’s honest and fair, but wants to make his employer money as well as provide value to his customer.  He’s neither a naif nor a shark – and he believes (correctly in his case) that any governmental involvement in the form of licensing, etc., would be unnecessary and intrusive.But there’s ‘the rub’ – HE may be both honest and shrewd, but not everyone else in his business – or any business – is.  And the soft part of the White western heart wants everything to be fair, and doesn’t like to see either little old ladies or merely stupid people being taken advantage of. There is always the demand to make things ‘right.’  But caveat emptor is a real thing, in any transaction, and it’s not therole of governmentregulation to protect people from their own naivete or lack of due diligence.How to do this without government intrusion?  I don’t know.  How to do this without a homogeneous, Christian, White population?  Impossible.

My big complaint, I guess, is that our “big White western heart” always chooses to empower the one who screws up everything it touches, government. That there’s a government seal of approval gives people a false sense of security. Health, economy, money, environment, immigration, domestic and international policy, etc., what have they done a good job on?

        I’m an American, I’m not a communist, and I’m supposed to love capitalism, but looking at how things turned out in practice, I’ll say this:
Communism is moral to a fault. It punished people and ground itself down in a purity spiral.
Capitalism is immoral (I’d say to a fault, but that might be redundant lol). It’s become a free-for-all and is exploding itself in a filth spiral.
I want to say both outcomes are the result of being ideological instead of practical.

            If you are Christian or even Paulian, capitalism is not immoral. “Thou shalt not steal” has no meaning without the notion of private property. The Commandment(s) about coveting your neighbors stuff means nothing if he’s not permitted to own stuff.

                    Good point. Probably more appropriate in this case, too, because I think @Paintersforms said he is a New Testament Christian who puts special emphasis on the red words.

            Markets, private property, saving and investing, etc., all predate capitalism by, what, at least a couple thousand years? I’ve often wondered why it took so long to give it a name, or if the name refers to something other than the things we all like.
Then I see looting, lying, liquidation, and perversion, and I figure whatever this capitalism thing is must be immoral.

                Depends on definitions.
As I use the term, markets, private property, saving and investing, etc.arecapitalism. Basically, you can do whatever you like with your stuff (caveats, yes) and reap either the gains or losses, depending on your acumen and luck.

        I ask . . . is there any realistic solution to this parasitic cancer that does not involve hard measures? Does anyone still think that the traditional institutional mechanisms of correction still function as they should? Look at the farce of the current Trump prosecution in New York. A former president is on trial for a non-crime and everyone knows that this is a politically motivated persecution. And yet there are no protests in the streets. The spring winds tighter however.And when in snaps, its not going to be pretty. Don’t take it out on your neighbor just because it’s convenient. Focus on the root of the problem. It’s worth the extra effort. And it’s the right thing to do.

        Like E. Michael Jones says, capitalism is state-sponsored usury. When the moneychangers engage in the behavior Z describes, it is a killing blow for any company. All of them – 100% – will die either sooner or later, because the debt is totally impossible to service. This behavior is disastrous for the businesses, horrible for the people who work at the businesses, terrible for the local communities, but is not just accepted by the government but encouraged and subsidized. You end up destroying the real, actual economy, the business of making and selling stuff, and walk away with a bunch of fake paper.The party can’t go on forever though and it ended in countries like Greece, Iceland, Ireland, and Japan in the past 30 years. It will happen here too. We are already starting to see the consequences, in the Donbass, of caring less about making stuff than pushing paper around.

            E. Michael Jones is a crank. He’s like a stopped clock.
Not 100% of companies will go bankrupt because of debt service. Those without debt will not only do fine, but will also be able to hoover up assets at pennies on the dollar, or possibly even less.
I’m looking forward to it.
Those with a Biblical worldview (“…the borrower is servant to the lender”) or a Shakespearean influence (“Neither a borrower nor a lender be” etc.) won’t fall for the financialization schtick in the first place.

Feel free to tell us where you stand with vulture capitalism.

Neither do the vulture capitalists of carrion capitalism.

                    Define “vulture capitalism”. If you mean someone who made the decision to avoid debt and is in a position to profit from those who were just after a fast buck by borrowing at 1%, knowing that could never last, I’m all for it.

                        If it bothers you, consider who it is that lent out the money. The guy who goes out of business gets a hit on his credit rating (and rightfully so) but it’s the banker who is out the cash.
Why does it bother you that the guys doing the financialization are the ones hurt by “vulture capitalism”?

There are not many who create currency out of thin air. The treasury when it issues bonds, and arguably the Fed when it allows fractional reserve.
But the banker must comply with GAAP. A $10k loan (asset) must have an offsetting $10k liability, which is generally owed to the Fed. But the banker is out the full amount if the debtor walks away. That’s why they bother with collections services.

            Commenter Steve writes that Capitalism, Inc. (i.e. rootless irresponsibility capitalism) is Christian, too, and he is correct. Christian motives to support it are not difficult to understand. It’s rapacious Christians’ greed, of course, but Capitalism, Inc., has been helpful for subsidizing missions, church construction, congregation formation, and related unnecessary activity. Christianity would turn the Earth’s land and seas into a wasteland on the pretext bamboozling humanity to accept a phony salvation.Meanwhile Jewish supremacy can look on with grudging approval, understanding full well that Christianity has been a useful, manipulable stalking horse for more than 1,000 years. Sects of Jesusism, while theologically repugnant to the pious believer of torahs, do normalize Israelite supremacy, patriarchy, and superstition. Christianity destroys other cultures and religions whether good or bad, ultimately for the benefit of Israel’s own and its ancient project of snatching everything.

                There’s a lot of truth there. Mainstream Christianity (more correctly, Paulianity) has a lot to answer for. Certainly they seem to be piling up treasures on earth. Just look at all the cathedrals and extravagant churches. How many set up in a Morton Building? I know of a couple, but most squander every penny they can. And they preach questionable doctrine, e.g., tithing.
I do think it’s appropriate to distinguish between Christians and Christianity, Inc., though.

The flip side is that F-35s that cannot fly cannot be used for additional stupid, expensive wars. It’s possible that we wasted $1 Trillion on these crappy planes but that functional planes may have ended up costing us $3 trillion in new wars. Pentagon efficiency haha…

        I guess I’m part of the problem.  After spending my working life building a mom and pop service business I began to look for a way to retire, and a corporate buyout offered more than a private buyout.  So I did it and stayed on running the place for a few years as a transition.  At first they were pretty hands off and the place continued to do well.  Then after a couple years the mid level management (girl bosses of both sexes) just couldn’t keep their hands off a good thing.  Growth and profits are down for the first time ever.  They like to blame efficiency and staffing but not admitting that nobody wants to work for them, and/or work hard for them.  I’m leaving at the end of the year.  It will limp on for a while, but at 50% of what it was doing.  What really ticks me off is the business became a vital part of the community, that’s been destroyed.  The same PE bought 12 other businesses (no real estate)  in my area, 4 of them have been shuttered.  It is a flim flam game.I do think that for you younger gents out there, the corporate world and the government world is a dead end.  But there are opportunities in small business.

            “corporate world and the government world is a dead end.”Mixed feelings on this. You do well with salary and the fact that they cover healthcare. The problem is, once you hit 50 and you’re making too much salary, you have a target on your back at budget time.I think the other issue is about the way your wired personally. It seems like you have to be kind of a player, making friends within any given organization, to get ahead. It’s performance as well, no doubt. It also takes the same skills that it takes to be popular in high school.

            Thank you for nicely illustrating the point that it is useless to blame individuals for cashing out and useless to blame the system for strip-mining regions of low entropy for a quick gain. Any individual and any system is vulnerable to this, because it’s just the way life works.There isn’t anything you can do to stop it in principle, but people should be made to understand that if you want to have honest institutions that work, or deeply rooted businesses competently managed by those with skin in the game, then occasionally somebody has to sacrifice for them. Somebody has tonotreap their due gains in exchange for keeping the social organs functioning as they should. There is no shortcut and no second option. The stability of society exists in direct proportion to the gratification that was deferred on its behalf. That is the true price of peace, and somebody, somewhere, has always had to pay it, though not necessarily the same person who enjoys the dividends.

Pretty cynical. Moreso than I am, even.
We used to have things like silent partners and contracts for deed back in the day when a man could transfer his business to his progeny or, failing that, to an ambitious neighbor kid. That system was not vulnerable, precisely because there was no low-hanging fruit to loot. Every asset had an offsetting liability, otherwise double entry bookkeeping wouldn’t work.
The real problem started when it became legal to use fictional entries to offset legitimate entries.

                    That’s the great thing about what I mean by capitalism, though. You get to match your actions to your values.
Getting filthy rich in my definition of capitalism means you have satisfied a crapton of the wants and desires of your fellow men. Would a system be better which encouraged you not to meet their needs?

                ID:  I think this is the best comment you’ve ever made here.  And you are exactly correct:  Someone needs to take less than maximum profit if there is to be anything to accrue as social capital.  Someone needs to sell his house to someone who would be a good neighbor,rather than the Cali refugee who offers double the value in cash, sight unseen.  But we all, also, believe we ought to have the right to dispose of our personal property as we see fit – even if that then results in strip-mined neighborhoods instead of solid, integral communities.There is always a cost, and no one wants to be the one to pay.

        Like many of your posts this strikes hard, and brings a sense of sadness for the situation we are in.  That said most or even all militaries operate as grifting machines in peace.  Russia and China have had that problem too.  Witness Prigozhin’s commentary and now the restructuring of military leadership.  The difficulty is in assessing a military’s effectiveness without engaging in combat.It would appear that the US would have an edge as its had a number of engagements over the past 30+ years.  Operation Desert Storm seemed to demonstrated that  the US military was at peak operating form – and seemed to show the soviet produced equipment poorly. It has operated with that aura of invincibility ever since, despite the fact that all of these opponents are sub-peer.One more thought. America is about advertising with all that is good and bad about that.  It’s been our advantage and it’s also seeming to be our downfall.

        We have been in the looting phase for a long time. Perhaps what we are now entering is the hyper-looting phase.At this point any critique to be effective should be naming names. For example, with the Invasion phase of TGR saying Biden or The Democrats isn’t effective. What is needed are the names and interlocking directory and payment receipts of all involved.The DS bureaucrats, the NGO heads and staffs, the church pastors and boards of directors … … The receipts are there. We need short but sweet exposes ready-made for Twitter.The same is true of every grift happening in this shopping mall.Of course top priority is educating the kids as the culture and its institutional transmission mechanisms have probably already collapsed. Well, no, they’ve been so subverted that they are aimed at remaking the dispossessed a broken part of the ghoulash.

        I remember in the late 1980s when Gordon Gekko was seen as a role model by many. I’m pretty sure that’s not what Oliver Stone intended. Which raises the question of who or what corrupted whom. Did the system corrupt the people or did the people corrupt the system? Not being a big believer in isms one way or the other, I’m leaning to the latter. Coincidentally, this was one generation after prayer was taken out of schools. Which in and of itself is just a data point, but is one indicator of a societal shift from transcendent values to material ones. And in a society based on material values, which somewhere along the way we definitely became, a bust out is both moral and right.

            I think it’s like @Zman’s essay yesterday(?) — the manager selection criteria changed. True, it started with a change in the laws such that corporate raiders became possible, and was exascerbated by the inflation of the ’70s, but ultimately, there would be no vulture capitalists if there were no people with morally-casual attitudes who are willing to destroy others’ lives for a buck.

            Stone’s Gekko was a three-dimensional character, an increasingly endangered species in all the arts and nearly extinct on the big screen.
But I think Ellis’s Patrick Bateman captured the actual spirit of the age we are in much better.  Especially when you consider that it is deliberately unclear whether any of his story is actually taking place anywhere outside his own imagination.
This is a disturbing observation, but there it is.

            Gekko was based on real-life characters who created and promoted ‘high-yield securities’ (i.e., junk bonds) like Ivan Boesky, who ended up in prison. I think it was Boesky who said ‘Greed is good’ at a Princeton graduation ceremony (the audience cheered). In the movie, Gekko says the same thing.

        The Communists made Capitalism work in China so I don’t know what that means except maybe there’s a fine line between the two in practice. The Chinese found they had to reserve a bullet for every capitalist to make it work lol. The Usual Suspects didn’t get to worm their way into the transition in China so it didn’t turn into a disaster there like it did in Russia. It took a Putin to shake off the fleas in Russia but that wasn’t inevitable, it was the Big One that got away. Maybe that’s why the neocons are in such a stink about Russia. I don’t know if critiquing these “big ideas” like Capitalism and Communism really gets you anywhere. Capital always needs a home, but I would say if we eliminate the Corporation as a routine registration thing and return it to the discretion of a legislature, a charter system, that would go a long way to purging the worst excesses.

        In the capitalist utopia of the future, we will be making and trading financial ‘products.’ And no-one will be making anything real. And no matter how successful you are as a financial ‘entrepreneur’, you won’t be able to buy anything real with your fiat billions, because there will be nothing real to buy. In other words a once real economy that made and traded real things will converge to the board game ‘Monopoly.’

            As long as there exists real private wealth in the United States, thefinancialization of everythingmakes sense. Millions of Americans retain real wealth – in land, in homes, in automobiles, in investments and savings – which effectively “back the dollar”, much as the gold holdings at Fort Knox and elsewhere supported the dollar when the gold standard operated. Add to this the considerable capital value of lands held by the Federal government itself, with its mining and timber rights, etc., and the motivation for piracy by “stakeholders” both private and public becomes clear.Our “Social Capital” is of course the real prize, for “hometown” bandits. We can’t blame the diversity for regional developers turning 200 acres of woods and fields into rows of 3000 sq ft homes on cul-de-sacs called “Walden Springs Lane”, “Rabbit Run” and “Hidden Valley Estates”. Nor can they be held responsible, when local farmers lease massive fields to solar power startups, either.Take my town for example. It is one of those pretty little villages in western New York that are well within range of the commute into the nearby city, with a “good school” (wink wink), little to no crime, a locally-owned grocery store, pleasant streets and neighbors, active and not altogether woke churches, and such like. Village government is open and honest and pays attention to costs. So; how does a banditfinancializethis happy place? Why, by building a 120-house development on one of the last remaining strips of open land on the edge of the village! A home in an idyliic village! Great school! Great people! Builder boy walks off with a million or two in profit, on to his next rape of an “idyllic community”. Meanwhile our sewage system needs expansion, our school will naturally demand more “resources” (which in fairness it will do anyway), the village loses much of its character, and maybe it’s time now to lock our doors at night.Private profit, public cost, as Z has said many times. It’s not just the diversity…

        I remember when red lobster and other big chain restaurants came into our suburb back in the 80s.  My boomer parents didn’t realize, but the low prices were putting mom &amp; pop restaurants out of business.  Fast forward 30 years, and now the big chain restaurants are too expensive for my dad, they’re filled with ‘mullen johns’ and he can get a cheaper meal at the new mom &amp; pop diners lol. Even if the big chain restaurants are franchises, possibly owned by a local, I see franchise owners as not having the same kind of soul or connection to the local culture as the mom &amp; pop shops.

        Read the Harper’s Ferry development story. Here is how the International Shopping Mall and Tourism Zone – NA 2 works.Do you really think that the story in the WSJ last week targeting West Virginia for mass immigrant invasion is unrelated? I doubt it. Some financier connected to some 5-start hotel and resort conglomerate bribed the hardline Conservative who is suddenly concerned with getting money for WV schools. The WSJ is doing its part to flood West Virginia with maids, landscapers, heavily accented anti-America (I mean pro ISM Tourism Zone NA2-WV1), docents, wait staff … … so that these resorts can support the new economy.The one positive is that this is one piece of the ISM TZ-NA2 pre-history that will not be erased. You have a crazed white man who committed an act of terrorism and who did it in the name of freeing black slaves. Now if that doesn’t support the narrative in many ways, what doesn’t. Oh and you have a hotel that can feature a black proprietor and an all black staff as its historical origins by putting up those phony retro black and white photos in fake oxidized frames. Heck! Go all the way and dress the all-Haitian staff up in antebellum plantation ware.Silver linings!

        Profit used to be the yardstick of efficiency. Profit was proof you were combining land, labor and capital in an efficient way and which satisfied a market demand.  If you were generating a loss, that meant you were doing something in an inefficient way or not satisfying a market demand and squandering land, labor and capital.

            Local restaurants fail for a variety of reasons, often from starting out with too much debt, but I can’t think of a once successful chain restaurant that failed without the food turning to crap many years earlier. But it’s possible that the food issue was just a symptom of the bust out, cost cutting on ingredients to maximize profit.

            And dividends was the way that profit was communicated to investors. You could weed out pretty much all junk on just a history of dividends, and a quick scan of their line card.
Of course, that didn’t cause enough financialization so Congress, in their infinite wisdom, chose to change the tax structure on “unearned” income to incentivize phony capital gains that could be exploited by big players and the stock option set.

                And 401ks would ensure lots of money flowed into the market. Which begs the question what is going to happen in a few more years when all of the boomers are retired and want to move their assets to less risky investments?    Will there be enough funny money to buy up all the assets they want to sell?While totally unrelated, lots of  60s cars and car part stashes are coming onto the market while classic cars are still booming with lots of boomers still bidding them up.  I think there will be a crash in anything and everything boomer related in the next 10-20 years.  The oldest boomers are hitting 79 this year.  You have to wonder what will happen to all the boomer real estate too.

No/yes. The price is what it is.

Same thing that happened to silents’ real estate. It will be subject to re-valuation, and the heir will have to decide whether to sell or pay the higher tax. In the case of multiple heirs, it’s almost certainly going to be sold. Early boomers should be fine, late boomers, not so much, but millenials, maybe late X and on are sitting pretty.

                        The Silents were not facing the same predicament.  The silents had a huge generation behind them to buy anything they were selling.  The Boomers have X behind them which is far smaller than boomers.  Millennials are also a large generation, but they will be a lot younger than the Boomers were when the Silents were selling.  They just don’t have the money.  Time will tell, I guess.

Right. So when silents passed, because there were more boomers than houses, there was a bidding war for property, i.e., rising house prices. When Boomers start passing, there will be more properties with fewer buyers, i.e., falling house prices.
This will be exacerbated by stock market declines, so Boomers might be in the case of selling housing at a loss just to pay medigap premiums.

                    As one of the earliest of the Gen Xers, I have been worried about this for years. If I were to get in on the real estate and stock market Ponzi schemes, I’d be the first one to get fucked when the Boomers all cash out.
My strategy has always been to stay out of debt, avoid conspicuous and frivolous consumption, pay cash and settle for guaranteed returns on things like Treasuries for 5%.
It is sometimes difficult to watch the Boomers getting free money in the stock Ponzi or in inheritances while I count pennies, though.

As another blogger says, you make money on the purchase not on the sale. From the point of view of whether Boomers crash the market, you probably have the better part of a decade before it becomes much of a threat.
But sounds like you are primed to take advantage of it when it happens. Good luck!

                        It’s a great time to get into funeral homes.  The baby boom turns into the funeral boom.  Just like how so many toy stores and toy makers went bankrupt after the boom, schools were built and abandoned, discotheques peaked and then crashed, now  the funeral home business will have a death boom followed by a crash.  Me also being early gen-x, it sounds kind of attractive.

                    Was in the west Phoenix last month visiting the boomer parents.  Was amazed at all the new build subdivisions going up.  What most interested me was that boomers are now building giant RV garages on their new, colossal houses (for maybe 2 people).  This begs the question; when they start dying off en masse, who’s going to want these monstrosities?  The boomers are the undisputed champs when it comes to malinvestment, but I suppose the old mantra holds true:
Whoever dies with the most toys, wins

                        I do sympathize with them. Sure, they don’t *need* a house that big, but they *do* need to to reinvest the capital gains they got holding their old house for 30, 40+ years. Well, either that or pay a third or more of it to government.
So if you bought a house in 1970 for the unimaginable sum of 100k, sold in 2024 for $1.2 million, you need to bury $1.1 mil in a house just to preserve your estate for your kids. Who won’t appreciate it anyway…

                    While totally unrelated, lots of 60s cars and car part stashes are coming onto the market while classic cars are still booming with lots of boomers still bidding them up.Anything with a stick shift is going to sit on the lot or go for fire sale prices since the vast majority of people can’t drive and don’t want a manual transmission.Alternatively a lot of Zoomer kids are going to be staring at the ass-end of gramp’s Boss Mustang, Camaro Z-28, or Hemi ‘Cuda in their garage as nobody can meet the asking price they’re sure they’d get at Mecom or Haggarty.

        “Nothing of value has been created by investors buying up this restaurant chain.”
While I agree with most of your article, that’s only one side of the coin. Remember, Darden sold this dog to private equity. They were at least theoretically able to cash out and redeploy the money they received to their more profitable concepts like Olive Garden, Longhorn and Ruth’s Chris.

        What’s going on isn’t “capitalism,” it’s America. They are going to turn Harper’s Ferry into a theme park, with the locals as extras, but extras who pay them by fixing up the houses and paying taxes. If they are lucky.

            I like JMG overall, but his lenocracy coinage is dumb. He keeps emphasizing that the basis of it is that pimps take a cut of prostitutes’ pay without providing any service, which is ridiculous.
Pimps provide security. Prostitution is illegal so they can’t get legal security or count on johns being afraid of cops or social sanctions, so the hookers are in grave danger of being beaten or killed at any time. Pimps definitely provide a service.

                I think you are supporting his argument that lenocrats exist from legal requirements.“That’s what makes our current situation a lenocracy: the power of the state gives their claims the force of law.”“Furthermore, this orgy of pimping is sponsored, controlled, and mandated by government at all levels and by the holders of political and economic power more generally. Thus, lenocracy.”He is not arguing that the laws were unnecessary in the first place. It is just that the regulatory burden keeps increasing over the years, because the government and big businesses benefit at the cost of small businesses.Speaking of prostitution being illegal at most places, making it legal can bring even worse side effects.https://dailycaller.com/2024/05/13/sex-work-labor-law-world-first-daan-bauwens-utsopi-belgium/“A new Belgian law passed earlier this month allows the government to mediate if employers of sex workers or the sex workers themselves complain that the sex workers refuse a client or a sexual act more than 10 times in six months.”

        Beautiful post. I’m away from home so difficult to type but you see your main points exemplified in the 1980s film, ‘Wall Street.’ Gordon Gekko is the avatar of predatory vulture capitalism. Ayn Rand taken to its logical conclusion. The profit motive itself is suspect. The ‘financialization of the economy’ was noticed and commented upon by post-Marxist theorists a century back (Kautsky, Hilferding).

        “That was like, ‘oh my goodness, we can’t let that happen,’” Rucker said.(from the Harper’s Ferry story)Yes, how dare the people who live there decide what they’re going to allow.“I had never once spoken with SWaN or met [the Schaufelds] or had anything to do with them,” Rucker said. “But I went to the session that year thinking, basically, we need to figure out a way to fix this.”This really gets to the heart of things. It’s one of those lies that people tell when they’re guilty as sin. She very narrowly defines who she didn’t talk to. But Rucker – and the reporter – studiously avoid who she DID talk to. The lies these people tell just makes you want to explode.

        A businessman for a multinational/international corporation really ought to be perceived and treated exactly as a foreign prince would be treated in politics and elections, and it sucks this adaptation never happens. MNCs create an aristocracy that badly needs to be checked.  NGOs/Nonprofits, same thing.The Trans-Pacific Partnership proposal presented an excellent example where business and trade interests eagerly craft provisions that will wreck a nation-state’s sovereignity and federalism when the time comes for their interest to stomp on any protection from that interest.  It’s a shame TPP gets memoryholed because ending TPP is partly what made Trump an attractive candidate in 2016, against both Hillary and the Republigoobers.But it ain’t gonna happen in AINO

        One more thing: Think of private equity in these situations along the same lines as like when we used to say “Jew in the junkyard” as kids. They’re basically taking assets of questionable value and parting them out, just like junkyards do. You would think Darden would be smart enough to do this themselves, or maybe not. Not a good situation to be in as an employee, but maybe these deals exist for a reason.
I do agree that it’s become more of an issue of the bankster tail wagging the dog these days, though.

            That’s not capitalism it’s something else. I really hate when people pick something bad in the economy and then blame it on capitalism. I’m a capitalist I’ve been a capitalist all my life and what capitalism is amounts to is picking a goal and working toward it financially.Blaming corporate raiding on capitalism is a pussy socialist way out. Breaking up companies and selling the pieces is more of a process of democracy than of capitalism. The extreme left in this country has everybody trained to blame everything that goes wrong on capitalism and anything that goes right is a socialist miracle. That’s all leftist propaganda.

                Yep. Saw a meme over at WRSA the other day. Somehow they forgot the obvious “Leftist”, but it is what it is.

Obviously there are non-Jews who also hold those worldviews, but it should give pause when you agree with (((them.))) At least re-evaluate your premises. Make damn sure they are valid, and not just some indoctrination you picked up along the way.
