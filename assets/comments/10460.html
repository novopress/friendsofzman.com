        Facebook and Twitter (and most forms of social media) are far more destructive than just overt censorship. They are the vehicle by which young people are being programmed to think and behave according to hive diktat. And when the hive reaches critical mass, all hell will break loose.

            The Google and Yahoo  home pages are relentless washers of brains. For three months after the election all three “Trending Stories” on the Google page were Adolf Trump and how he would affect you. Even I was astonished.I asked a graduate chemistry student that I work with where her common social media outlets and users were coming down on Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Accord, and she told me it was virtually unanimous. She is no longer homo-unanimous but on the other hand she does tend to look at me, her sole source of alternate information, as if I might be borderline radioactive. It must be difficult–when everything you assume to be true and righteous is wrong–to change your mind about a single thing without risking everything. At some level they know banishment waits over that horizon.

        I can’t speak for Gab, but what people don’t understand about “free” services like Facebook is that they aren’t providing a product for free. They are making you think you are getting a product (their platform) but you are the product, who is being sold (or at least having your information sold) to firms who want to know more about you: whether they want to know more about you to sell you crap or to blackmail you (with a “permanent record” as you alluded to) is irrelevant, because the people who want to sell you stuff and the people who want to tell you what to believe are the same people at this point.It really is disgusting and the Zuckerborg is a true sociopath. I remember reading in Larry Rosen’s “I-Disorder” about how Zuckerberg created a forum for people with terminal diseases to talk about their emotional journey with each other. The page was trolled for info related to people’s preference to / reaction to certain medications, which was then sold off to various firms. Mark better hope Dawkins and his fellow douches are right, because otherwise the devil is keeping that seventh circle of Dante’s inferno stoked with coals for the day Zuckerberg arrives.

        Reading an old book published in 1913 by Home University written by J. B. Bury the famous historian of ancient Greece titled The History of Freedom of Thought. Bury turns out to have been a Fabian socialist whose idea of freedom of thought involved socialism good, free economic association and private property bad, progress is a religious linearity toward secularism powered by rationalistic humanism. Reading it you can see in embryo the intolerant attitude toward actual freedom of thought exhibited by his ideological (note I didn’t say intellectual) heirs.The point is there is nothing new about this. Modern communications have simply accelerated a process that was already in place. I think that the more aware folks on the left know this deep down, and know what the end game is. They can’t win if regular folks know what is up. They think they still have a shot at 1984/BNW and they think if they can outsprint us to the finish line they will win. Their problem is that they don’t seem to understand what a tiny fraction of mankind they represent. Their numbers are there in the big cities and they control a lot of the commanding heights in every field, but they are in total denial of the fact that they are who and what they claim to hate, while billions look on and wait for their own chance.

            I am a fan of Evgeny Zamyatin’s distopia “We”, the predecessor of both 1984 and BNW. The One State exists as a perfect society behind its Green Wall and ordered by the principles of Taylorism and the Table of Numbers. Every citizen, or Number, has a right to sexual access to any other Number, and everyone is perfectly interchangeable. The Great Operation will shortly eliminate the last shreds of individuality. And yet something happens.In my opinion it is an even better fir for today.And yes, 33 years ago a thesis on this book would have ended an academic career, but for a stiff spine and a skull of granite.

        The Civil Rights Act of 1964 punctured the rights of freedom of association. After all, if you could not choose to associate on the basis of skin color, then why could you choose to associate on the basis of gender or sex preferences? The obvious answer according to liberal whites was, “you can’t.” LBJ’s mischief continues to gather strength. Its radical extremes know no bounds and we have no idea where this will end.

        The problem with the modern progressives is that it’s not enough to drive people out of popular spaces: they want to ensure they can’t set up elsewhere either. These people want 100% conformity and compliance, not merely pushing people to the fringes.

        I am in New Zealand and the mindless facebook has total dominance here. In New Zealand it is a dumbed down sloganeer’s platform, thick with adverts. I wish for the day it collapses into itself.   My main reading is on sites like this.

        Does Torba understand the irony of an (ostensibly) free speech platform that requires an account login before a user can even browse the platform? In this critical respect, Gab is less “free” than Twitter.I don’t have a Twitter account, nor do I want one. But I regularly click on your Twitter feed and then browse around the feeds you follow. No login required.When I click on your Gab feed I can see one screen of your posts with numbers on the side. I can click through your links, but if I try to browse anywhere else on the site I am presented with a pop-up which requires me to create an account and login. It’s no less obnoxious than an unwanted advertisement. This is when I close the page.Unless Gab allows free and open browsing without a login it is destined to become an alt-right ghetto on the Internet.

            That login requirement to even see stuff also cost them my interest in Gab.  I don’t want to sign up for anything but would gladly browse if possible.

            This has nothing to do with speech. Maybe it is bad marketing, but it is entirely unrelated to the speech. You having to buy a ticket to see the movie is not a restriction on the movie maker.
I happen to think it is a good idea to require registration to view posts. It rules out the paranoids and the Progressive trouble makers. It’s a good way to limit the Left’s habit of turning virtues into vices.

                With all respect, I disagree. In a constitutional sense, the right to free speech includes the right to consume content as well as the right to publish content. Ergo, the government can’t restrict your right to read/watch/listen to content it finds objectionable.I understand fully that Gab is a private entity and not subject to constitutional restrictions, but IMO there’s an inherent contradiction between a site that bills itself as “open” and “free speech” but requires an account to access. It’s akin to keeping the content behind a paywall, but the cost is your registration information.Per my experience and Drake’s experience, the login requirement also rules out a lot of lurkers–those who might enjoy reading the content but have no interest in creating content. It is piss poor marketing, which is why I maintain that Gab will become a ghetto for the alt-right.I loathe the SJWs at Twitter and wish Gab all the best, but they need to revise their business model if they want to command any presence.

                        Even a fake address ties you to the email service provider which, in turn, ties you to any other activity conducted on the Internet using that email account. This is how /pol identified the UC Berkeley employee from the first Berkeley riot.http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/06/uc-berkeley-rioter-identified-as-university-staff-member/The fake email address also ties you to an ISP and an IP address, which in turn can be linked to any other aliases used on the internet. This is how people get doxxed for wrongthink.Further, depending upon your ISP’s archive policy this may provide a link to your complete browsing history. BTW, ISPs can now sell your browsing data.It won’t be long before an “Internet Activity Safety Check” becomes an integral part of a background check for employment, military service, volunteer service, financing, etc. Do you doubt that SJWs will pressure corporate America to adopt “inclusive” safety standards and refuse to hire or do business with persons who exhibit wrongthink by visiting websites that are deemed to be unacceptable by SJWs? Do you doubt that Corporate America will comply? Ready to be denied a job or a mortgage because you browsed SBPDL or The Z Blog in 2017?I understand that all this information can be patched together without an email address, but it’s much more difficult. Having the email address makes it easy and straightforward. All in all it’s just another brick in the wall of Internet surveillance that is intended to suppress free speech. The question is Why is Gab adding that brick to the wall?

                            You not signing up to read content will have no impact on this. In fact, you are making it easier to track you on-line. Instead, you should have a few dozen e-mail accounts, multiple LinkedIn pages, a decent VPN service and make sure to reboot your home modem every day. The more chaff, the harder it is to tie you to anything.

                Respectfully disagree, ZMan. By signing-up for a Gab account, you surrendered some of your freedom. Can’t rationalize-away that fact. You became a product.

        The thing is, though, like the poet wrote, “Meet the new boss.  Same as the old boss.”I think that’s why Facebook has stuck around.  As much as people complain about censorship and such, really, there is basically none of that on Facebook for the average person.  Yeah, at the margins, maybe, but your average mom or dad posting a picture of their kid fishing on Sunday?  Not so much.  In fact, I would credit Facebook more than Twitter for Trump’s win last year.  The media likes to call it “fake news”, but the rest of us like to call it, “Hillary REALLY IS a felon, and we have proof.”That kind of stuff carried the day for Trump last year.  People could live stream his rallies and hear him and see the crowds for themselves.  His “tweets” always wound up on people’s feeds.  Every nutbag fever swap Lib Commie rant about Trump wanting to put Muslims in concentration camps and black people back in the cotton fields was met with derision and facts and it allowed people who might ordinarily feel isolated feel like they had friends who were voting for Trump too.Do I like that the people who run these companies are Leftist whack jobs?  No, not really.  Does it have much, if any, bearing on my life?  Also no, not really.  The day it does is the day people drop it like a hot rock, and these guys all know it.That, in and of itself, is the limiting factor of technology.

        I signed up with Gab early on and while it is good it suffers from a boring presentation and I don’t like having to sign in. I am not into searching for articles to comment on, most of what I want I find on other websites. The look of the page is boring, blocky, uninteresting and I won’t spend much time on it. Maybe something better will replace it.
