        My brother married a girl originally from Lagos.   They live in an apartment in a Left Coast whitopia, but they noticed that they can get a 3-story townhouse with wood floors in Lagos for the same price, so now of course she wants to move there.   They are intentionally oblivious leftists‚Äìthe only kind of people who would move there.   Glad to hear Z man is getting out.

            Sounds like the old joke ‚ÄúDid you hear that you can buy a house üè° in Detroit for $1?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs the catch?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou have to live in Detroit.‚Äù
Sounds like your brother and sister in law have to learn the stove is hot by putting their hands on the lit burner. I hope you can talk some sense into them.

            She‚Äôs *from* there and wants to move back!?! Wow, I can sometimes forgive Portland shitlibs who move to Baltimore or Detroit when they hear about the fabulous bargains on houses there. Sometimes they do this even knowing that those cities are basically 100% black. Portland Whites, though, never meet actual, real blacks. The only blacks they know are the ones on TV who are all neurosurgeons and stockbrokers. I suppose it‚Äôs possible that your sister-in-law is one of those people I used to know who would say they were from Baltimore but actually lived way out in Harford or Carroll County and made a point of driving all the way around the beltway to get to the other side of the city.

        I enjoyed ZMan‚Äôs post, but I beg to differ on his assessment of Trump‚Äôs chances.I don‚Äôt think the Donald will be ‚Äúgone.‚Äù He‚Äôll weasel his way out of any conundrum (no disrespect intended by the use of weasel-word). He‚Äôs like a rubber ball in squash: whack him as hard as you like against the wall, he only bounces back harder.The thing about Trump is THE POLLS SHOW HIM BEATING BIDEN IN A GENERAL ELECTION. Even a year out, polls are pretty accurate indicators of what‚Äôs going to happen. It‚Äôs been that way since 2008, when Obama defied the polls and had a good personal result.And you have to factor in one more thing: the polls tend tounderestimateDonald Trump‚Äôs level of support among the population. People aren‚Äôt always confident enough to tell the truth to a stranger about where their heart lies. If this is the case, we could be in for a Trump landslide come the new year.(To read more of my stuff, click on my name with your mouse.)

            And how, pray tell, does one win an election when their NAME is not on the ballot?
The utter farcical illusion of ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô is being torn down now in multiple states where leftists are just tossing his name off the ballot.
You are living in an alternate reality. The only ‚ÄòRepublican‚Äô that may ever get elected again will be a bone throw RINO just to give the kabuki theater that is our fake &amp; gay government some passing semblance of credibility. See: Nimrata Randhawa Haley

            ‚Äú Even a year out, polls are pretty accurate indicators of what‚Äôs going to happen‚ÄùNot really.  Lot can happen in a year‚Äîeven if you believe in polls.  Polls are not necessarily accurate and are subject to great mischief.  Let me remind everyone that the ‚Äúpolls‚Äù had Clinton ahead of Trump up until the week before the election.  One poll had Clinton a 10-12 point favorite!  That poll then began to alter their prediction everyday until the weekend before the election.  Those statisticians/pollsters in the know said that this was basically impossible and described this organization as trying to ‚Äúget right with Jesus‚Äù before being shown to be corrupt and in the bag for Clinton after the election.There are broadly two types of polls.  Oddly, often hired by the same folk. One, for internal use only, is to give as precise a description of voter opinion and demographics as possible.  The other, for press release, to persuade the masses of your candidate‚Äôs viability or ability to win the election and to demoralize the opposition.You don‚Äôt need a PhD to understand the psy-ops involved here, nor much understanding of polling to see how this is done.  Of course, the questions asked and the demographics polled are almost never revealed.  For example, If you want Biden to be shown to be winning then simply poll more Dem‚Äôs than Rep‚Äôs or improperly sample Blue States in preference to Red States or urban folk in preference to rural folk.  If you want to show Trump‚Äôs lead declining, ask a question of who you‚Äôd vote for: Biden, Trump, DeSantis.  (Yes, they‚Äôre not above such.)Such shenanigans was quite common during the Clinton/Trump race.  Treat polls as basically entertainment‚Äîlike pre-fight weigh ins, but don‚Äôt bet on them.

        Often topic, but important, I think.  Jared believes that the blacks and the chosen are waking up to his ideas.  He says many times, with some relief, ‚Äúbetter late than never.‚Äùhttps://www.amren.com/podcasts/2023/12/blacks-for-trump/This is an important moment because it‚Äôs rare when anyone makes a testable prediction in politics.Are the blacks and chosen going to take up Jared‚Äôs viewpoint to the degree that political changes are made?  Or is Jared just making the same mistake that conservatives have been making for the last 50 years?My guess is that he is mistaken, but if he turns out to be correct, I will adjust my beliefs.  I hope that Jared will do the same if he turns out to be wrong.My belief is that racial tribalism is the most powerful force in the world over non-whites.  (Other forces, like religion, greed, and the desire for material comfort, are also powerful, but not the most powerful.)  Further, the non-whites want to overthrow traditional whites more than they want to the prosperity of maintaining the white civilization that we had before BLM destroyed what was left of our cities.

            Am not following Jared as closely as I once did.  However, the *test* of his hypothesis proves what‚Äîthat the ‚Äútalented tenth‚Äù might pull away from their ‚Äúknee-jerk‚Äù ethnocentrism?
85% of the Black population in America is below average IQ.  They can never obtain/earn a status equivalent to the population in the upper 50% of the curve. (This goes for other races as well.) Therefore, they have no choice but to band together to obtain power, handouts/welfare, and status unearned through dint of merit.
Jared should know, this can never end peacefully as Blacks have too much to lose.

        A year‚Äôs end reply to Mr. House, below, re Left Coast Inmate‚Äôs urging to use what we have, where we‚Äôre at:‚ÄúMe, I‚Äôm just broke and in debt.Got 5 family situations in several states I‚Äôm dealing with here, what do I do, just tell them to eff off?Captain of the Titanic, I know. But I was raised on Depression stories. They never quit, though by God they wanted to.‚ÄùAll that debt and brokeness is because I invested in other Dirt class like myself.I took on hard problems, intractable ones; personal stuff, problems and aspirations that have been years in the making.  Things they just couldn‚Äôt solve themselves.It sucks, it‚Äôs bloody awful, I am in dire straits right now, but you know what the big surprise is?It‚Äôs working.  I have gotten several big ones over the hump.  I just showed up and things started happening.  New stuff is popping up, good cripes already, but each hurdle leaves me better informed and somewhat prepared.Now remember, I am a failure in all things, and fall far short of anyone else here.  The wind got really knocked out of my sails this year at my greatest failure.And no, it‚Äôll never work, it‚Äôll never get any better.  So what?  No rest for the wicked.This place encourages and enlightens me, it gives me direction as to where to point the ship.  I entrust myself to the Z-audience for guidance and wisdom.When the going gets tough, the tough drink themselves senseless and grab all the hard drugs, fast cars, and trashy women they can.So here‚Äôs to you, oh most questionable characters at this dive bar.  Thanks for all you do for this unworthy one.  I‚Äôd rather have friends in low places, anyways.

            Am I the only one who thinks there is potentially a magnificent novel to be written based upon the travails described in this post. True wisdom is born of hard knocks and telling that story in all its inglorious detail can be a lesson to us all. That is your homework assignment. Chapter 1 is due by February.

                    My greatest understanding as I reflect in old age is that my life has *not* simply been a product of my own doing.  No, I accept ‚Äúfull* responsibility for my actions and resulting (negative) outcomes.However, there are so many points in my life where outcomes have been so fruitful, beneficial, positive (In hindsight) that it is beyond even my human arrogance to attribute such to myself.  For those of you who are non-believers, you can call it ‚Äúluck‚Äù.My wife and I can only attribute these things to Divine Providence, or Grace‚Äîand no one can claim they deserve such.  In there lies proof of a higher Power.

                        Nice, Compsci.  I‚Äôm not a believer, but I think that I understand and respect what you‚Äôre saying.
The world is complex and there are many different plausible interpretations for our experiences.  It‚Äôs hard to adjudicate which one best explains the data.
On a philosophical note, as much as I am inclined towards determinism and the minimization of free will and nurture, it sure does seem that trying hard sometimes yields results that are surprising.  If that feels like Providence or God to you, well, you may be right.

                        Compsci:  Beautifully said.  I, too, have been the unwarranted beneficiary of so much divine grace.  Another important understanding that has come with age is an appreciation of just how much I‚Äôve benefited from what others built before me.  Sure, I was born with a certain IQ potential and worked for and earned my academic credentials, but none of that would have been possible without the founders and funders of those institutions (universally White Christians).  Not to mention the wisdom of the ages written and printed and passed down and shared.So we are all a product and beneficiary of both our genetics and our cultural and physical environments ‚Äì not in the halfrican ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt build that‚Äù shite Obama pushed, but in the sense we are heirs to a civilization and owe a certain debt to those who built it.

                Yes, we are a meeting place of sorts.  A ‚ÄúCheers‚Äù writ live.  However, the level of thought, insight, discussion, life experience, intellect, is really something special.  Where else can a respectful/peaceful discussion be had between people of such divergent belief systems such as Christianity and atheism be found?

        I refueled my car yesterday at a Shell station in Freiburg-im-Breisgau, Germany and paid about 1.75‚Ç¨ per liter.  There are 3.875 liters in a gallon (6.62‚Ç¨ per gallon).  One euro is worth about a dollar ten.  So I paid about $7.31 per gallon, not $10.00 per gallon.  Gasoline prices are higher here in France, especially along the autoroute (2‚Ç¨ per liter).  In 2020, the price of a liter of gasoline was about 1.25‚Ç¨ per liter.

                        Same here. I paid 2.76 at the res outside of Pembroke NY. Local store is at 3.65. A fill-up of my Silverado saves me about $20, stocking up on smokes, another $80-100. My wife really wants me to quit smoking, and of course she is quite right. Yet, part of the fun of buying ‚Äì and smoking ‚Äì cigarettes bought at the res is in calculating the money I did not pay to the pirates in Albany. My monthly sojourn to the res is a pleasant drive too, as I use only back roads, not the Thruway with its Orwellian surveillance system (tolls were supposed to end in 1997, yet strangely, they did not end, thanks to our last ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù governor).

        The key to understanding Ukraine is Iraq.  Same propaganda.  Same chest-thumping bravado.  And it will meet the same end: a client state of its next-door neighbor.  We just decided to throw 500,000 Ukrainian men into the meat grinder instead of our own, having learned the one important lesson of Iraq which is to get other people to do your fighting for you.  Once the public catches onto the scam (which they now have), you‚Äôre better off if they aren‚Äôt seeing body bags flying home in support of that scam.  Expect Ukraine to devolve into something akin to the low-intensity insurgency conflicts we saw in the 2000s.  The money just isn‚Äôt there and it has become politically untenable to sustain a large war front.Trump is performing exactly as I thought post-indictments.  I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd go through with it because indictments would benefit Trump.  But, we are dealing with devious and corrupt people, not smart people.  I thought he would be at 70% by now, but he is knocking on the door, and his voting results in the primaries will be well above his polling floor.  You‚Äôre starting to hear the word ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù showing up in the media and among friends and neighbors.  People are furious about these phony indictments.  If Trump wins, Jack Smith will flee the country.  At this point, it‚Äôs unlikely Trump‚Äôs primary opponents keep him below 1,800-2,000 delegates.  He might well run the table at this point because people are so angry.  Keep in mind, this is the guy who in 2020 received an epic number of primary votes running essentially unopposed (except that Weld guy, but he was a joke).  IIRC he either got the most primary votes of any incumbent Republican POTUS or most primary votes of any incumbent POTUS in history.  It‚Äôs easy to forget the 92-mile-long parades, the boat parades, the rallies, etc. that happened during the COVID-primaries.Everything we are seeing now in CO and ME is a direct response to the utter and complete disaster Jack Smith‚Äôs indictments have become.  It‚Äôs increasingly unlikely that either trial will happen before the election. And the closer to the election these trials get, the more Trump will benefit.  People aren‚Äôt all that bright or plugged into politics.  So having the trials right next to the general election will illustrate clearly that Biden is prosecuting Trump so that Biden can jail his political opponent.  Trump will get to double-digit leads over Biden if there‚Äôs a trial next Fall.  It‚Äôs more likely at this point that SCOTUS will try to save Democrats from themselves by throwing these cases out.  The judge in Miami might just do it herself if the DOJ keeps lying to her.We all thought the Democrats would shove Biden down the stairs by now, so you‚Äôre not alone in that.  The fact that they haven‚Äôt shows how rotten their core is.  Newsome did a debate against DeSantis (that nobody watched) and that scared the hell out of Democrats.  Newsome is not their savior.  They have no savior other than voting fraud.  That debate was set up months ago on the idea that Trump would be in jail/disqualified and Biden would withdraw for either health or Hunter reasons.  What we got was a debate between two empty suits.  For his part, Biden is a vegetable.  They will try to repeat their 2020 strategy of hiding him in the basement.  They might not even let him debate.  Trump, OTOH, will be excited to debate Biden who is falling apart before our eyes.  There isn‚Äôt an area of economic or political or foreign policy where things got better under Biden.  Vastly more people died from COVID.  Two new wars.  Massive inflation.  $5 gas.  Political corruption and bribery.  Biden is going to get butt-f***ed on national television if they let him debate.So we‚Äôre down to vote fraud like we saw in 2022.The economy is weird.  There‚Äôs still so much money sloshing around and so much government spending that it‚Äôs hard to see what is going on.  Recessions in a poor country are easy to spot.  Recessions in a rich country where people‚Äôs biggest problem is that the 85‚Ä≥ QLED TV at Best Buy is $700 and their house is loaded with stuff they don‚Äôt even need are harder to see.  When a wealthy country pulls back a bit on spending, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúrecession‚Äù, but just like a rich person pulling back, it‚Äôs usually short-lived to fill up the tanks and start spending again.Most of the doomsday stuff predicted for 2023 did not happen.  That‚Äôs normal.Most of the doomsday stuff predicted for 2024 will not happen either.  That is also normal.The black swan event in 2024, if there is one, will be either the cancelation of the election, a completely in-your-face voter fraud that re-elects Biden, or a Trump landslide.  The most likely sitting at my desk today?  Trump wins and the US Government goes into full on Civil War mode.  They‚Äôll refuse to follow his executive orders and at least one US Government Employee will try to assassinate Trump.  Trump‚Äôs civil war mode will be mass firings.  2025 is going to be epic‚Ä¶maybe.It cannot be overstated how important re-installing Biden is in 2024.  Because they‚Äôve gone to war with the country, Biden getting booted means the country gets to go to war with the Government Party.I‚Äôve been calling Trump 2024 a ‚Äúreckoning‚Äù.  A settling up of accounts.  But the word you‚Äôre hearing more from even stable people?Revenge.

            Biden deteriorating by the day, his face has the look of a near-death dementia patient and has since before 2020. It loks like a wax figure being exposed to increasing heat and gradually beginning to smooth out and melt and run.
It speaks poorly of him and his family that they would put him through all this. They, with good reason, hate his guts and are using him for all they can.

                Yeah I was talking to my dad about this the other day, that while evil people do seem to get ahead in life they usually end up in old age with their entire family hating them and are miserable and alone.
Biden certainly spent most of his life forcing his family and friends to kiss his asshole because they needed access to his influence.  Now that he‚Äôs senile and they can just push him around they have no memories of him acting like a human being and justifiably no reason to treat him with any care or respect.

                ‚ÄúWhite Christian Amurrikkkunz have had an existential blindspot in their surveyance of the purview of the sociological landscape.‚ÄùJQ: are we Jews? EMJ mentioned it recently, certain Anglicans taking up the idea they‚Äôre one of the tribes of Israel.Someone mentioned on here a little while back Germanic types are natural spergs iirc. Sounds right to me. I can picture people thinking through the logic of Christianity and coming to the contradiction‚Äî Gentiles worshipping a Hebrew god. Which, to the sperg mind, might leave two possibilities: apostasy, or we must be Hebrews!Ugh, the sperg out. How about Jesus fulfilled the Law to make the radical break possible‚Äî preaching to the Gentiles? Which, of course and provided they took to it, would have the effect of making Christianity a Gentile religion, rather than making Gentiles Jews.Radical breaks are untidy things that clockwork minds have a hard time dealing with.

            If Trump just ‚Äúwent away,‚Äù I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúright‚Äù would lift a finger. This seems to me like the ‚Äú3rd way‚Äù out of the corner the regime has painted itself into, where it either has to burn it all down to prevent another Trump term, or burn it all down after he becomes president again.
But they could have something else entirely planned. As I keep saying, who could have predicted the plandemic?

            ‚ÄúTrump, OTOH, will be excited to debate Biden‚Ä¶‚Äù
That could work. Trump could give his answers, then step a few feet to another podium and give his impression of Biden giving his answers. That would be funny as heck. Could probably even put it on Pay Per View.
He‚Äôd have to focus on Biden‚Äôs stupidity, though, probably refrain from mocking his disability. Which might be tough for Trump.

                Long, insightful comments are one of many reasons this blog provides so much value. If a long comment isn‚Äôt insightful, it can be skimmed or skipped. If it‚Äôs a rambling incoherent mess or disagreeable in some way, it can be downvoted.
It‚Äôs really not that hard.
The fact that hokkoda‚Äôs ‚Äúwall of text‚Äù comment now has 44 likes is strong evidence that it provided value. In contrast, your odd complaint about its length has zero upvotes and five downvotes.
These numbers speak for themselves.

            No matter what outcome, the election in 2024 will be a Black Swan. A year from now our country will not be the same. There will be clarity as to the actually-existing battle lines, there will be no more Normies, there will be no more piffle as to ‚ÄúOur Democracy‚Äù. My own prediction is that Biden will win, and win handily, quite possibly unanimously, as the GOP may not even have the vigor to field a realistic candidate. The motto of the ruling Party will be, in effect, ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do about it?‚Äù Hard swimming ahead, folks. The nation is in ruins.

        ‚Äúthe safe bet is that current trends will continue‚Äù.  Words to live by.
By definition you can‚Äôt plan for something you can‚Äôt predict.  I stopped investing in my 401k and was hoarding bullets, toilet paper and whiskey, until my sister and brother in-law set me straight.  The best bet is tomorrow will be pretty much like today.  Invest your time and resources accordingly.

            Zulu Juliet:  Why not both (bullets/beans/bandaids + investing)?  As far as trusting that they won‚Äôt nationalize/take your 401k, as they‚Äôve been discussing for years, a lot depends on how the vote fortification goes and how restless some natives get over 2024 economic circumstances.  I‚Äôd rather have a paid -off mortgage/car than numbers on a screen.  Yes, even after they take their damned tax share ‚Äì we‚Äôre past the penalty age but they still ream you on taxes because by now we‚Äôre supposed to be living minimally on social security.  Too bad we don‚Äôt follow their script.

                Amen @3g ‚ÄìSince I started my career I tried to do everything right.  I‚Äôve grown my salary, worked hard, I‚Äôve saved/invested the max for retirement.  In addition I stocked up on thousands of rounds of ammunition, stayed clear of any doubt outside my mortgage and put as much additional money away as possible in the hopes that my wife and I can retire comfortable in a rural setting where I can be rid of diversity and spend my time fishing, playing music and meddling in the software projects I enjoy.The hoarding of the ammunition was for when they decide to nationalize/seize my retirement accounts.  For me that would push me over the so-called edge.

                    Tired Citizen:  Just keep an eye on your savings and investments.  I know that plenty of people do extremely well in the stock market, and my husband bemoans times that he should have done this or that and we‚Äôd have an extra ‚Äòx‚Äô amount of money now, but . . . I don‚Äôt trust either the market or the banks.  Even when it comes to cash, I‚Äôm of the belief that if you don‚Äôt hold it, you don‚Äôt own it.  Between the end of Glass-Steagal and bank bail-ins, plus the past three years‚Äô inflation, you‚Äôre better off with tangible goods ‚Äì like land and a paid-for house.Yes, I know the lack of allodial title means one must always be prepared for property tax hikes.  State of residence makes a big difference there.  I am also well aware that precious metals are not an investment but can be (not always are) a hedge against inflation.  I would still rather have some.I know the cloud-people on the coasts live one way, but the wealthier people I know invest in property, tangible goods, and metals.  I think watching what certain people do, rather than what the ‚Äòfinancial experts‚Äô say, is the wisest course.

                        Knowing the skill sets of my neighbors and contemporaries, I have accumulated 6,000 butane lighters. They‚Äôll be worth their weight in gold when things turn to shit. Sure, it‚Äôs a gamble; after all you can‚Äôt eat them. But in a post-industrial free-for-all, barter will emerge naturally, and the ability to make fire will be a ‚Äúhard asset‚Äù exchangeable for other basic requirements.On the same principle I have begun stocking cases of decent (though by no means superior) bourbon. People are going to want disinfectants, and getting seriously lit from time to time.Highly exchangeable, value-dense commodities answering basic needs of life in an environment of privation, confusion, and terror.

            Have you learned nothing from the last five years? Since then government, federal, state or local, can shut any business down, lock everyone in their house, your neighborhood can be burned down with police standing by drinking coffee. Gov can demand to see your permit to walk the street, food can get twice as expensive in a few months, civilian ammo production can be shut down. Medicines run out. And there are currently at least two wars with the potential to go boom!Better to have extra food and fuel and not need it than to need it and not have it  But hey, whadda I know, good luck with your no prepping strategy.

            Everybody should prep ‚Äúsome.‚Äù The mistake is thinking you can prep for the end of the world, and predict when and how that happens (unless you really want to live that way). Probably the best prepping is not having any debt.
Unless you‚Äôre a billionaire and can afford your own self sustaining compound on some south seas island. In which case you‚Äôre probably not reading this blog.

            100%.  Prepping is just stupid.
The Communist takeover of Russia and the ensuing Soviet domination of the surrounding area went on for almost 100 years.

                2020 really narrowed down the expat options. Pretty well eliminated the ‚Äúwest‚Äù and the Pacific Rim entirely. The country that came through that with its sanity most intact just happened to be right next door. Mexico. If they don‚Äôt become part of the Greater North American Co Prosperity Sphere in the ensuing years, which I think is a danger. But you can‚Äôt plan for everything.

                    If I were a young white man in the United States today, I would seriously think about emigrating to Uruguay.  It‚Äôs a relatively stable country and Spanish isn‚Äôt a particularly difficult language to learn.

                ProZNoV:  You‚Äôre better than this ‚Äòall or nothing‚Äô fallacy.  I‚Äôm not hiding in a cave, but I have moved far away from the city and I love it.  Yes, I am safer and more private but I am no hundred-year hermit.   I don‚Äôt have 10 years‚Äô of food put aside, but I do have extras so I don‚Äôt have to drive into town all the time other than for fresh produce or extra meat.  I have no emergency medical training but I do have a variety of OTC meds.There is prepping and then there is prepping.  We lived through the 2021 Texas freeze, learned some lessons, and made some provisions thereafter.  Same when our water heater died and we had 3 days without public water (shut off valve wouldn‚Äôt work) until the plumber could get to us.  We‚Äôre not learning to plow at age 65, but it‚Äôs just common sense and exprience to plan for some shortages and delays after the scamdemic and now with the world shipping woes.There‚Äôs been a problem finding dry-eye drops for my husband (necessary ever since vision surgery many years ago) because of recalls due to a number of people blinded by unsterile drops from India.  All of our meds and toiletries come from China and India.  Half our beef is imported, although labeled ‚ÄúUSDA‚Äù and processed in the US.I‚Äôve lived overseas, and I well know the grass isn‚Äôt always greener.  But planning to prepare (for anything ‚Äì from a test to a sports competition to the very uncertain future) is planning to fail.

                    3g4me:I respect your opinion.  +1., all comments, always.Prepping for a disruption (natural disaster like a hurricane, grid overload, flood, or tornado) is common sense.  Personally, I‚Äôm good for a year, minimum.MAYBE for an EMP event (weeks, or months).But ‚Äúprepping‚Äù for a totalitarian cycle like a civil war or communist takeover isn‚Äôt rational.  It‚Äôs insane.Absent a ‚Äúmannerbund‚Äù (non-existent, in the USA), the only rational response is to leave.  Even then, some fights can‚Äôt be won.Before it‚Äôs too late.  Our forefathers had the courage to come here from their troubled countries.Those who survived the 6+ million you-know-what did.  They fled.Do you?  Do I?(Not to humble brag:  I‚Äôm well above ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù income‚Äù.   Some fights cannot be won, and honestly, may not be worth fighting for.  I‚Äôm actively looking for options.  Are you?)

                        ProZNoV:  I equally respect and value your comments and opinions.  Now that you have clarified your comment, I can agree that ‚Äòprepping‚Äô with a view to somehow surviving or waiting out ‚Äúx‚Äù decades of an actively hostile regime is not rational or feasible.  And I take your point that various people leaving their European nations for America over the past few centuries was a rational and ultimately good decision.But it was also a large gamble.  They had no guarantee the US was going to continue to be hospitable and succcessful, but given their era and worldview it was a logical assumption.Today, that is no longer so for most of the civilized world.  As I‚Äôve noted before, I have been privilged to reside, for 1-3 years each, in five very different countries outside the US.  While I could have been happy and possibly successful in a few of them, they were not ultimately ‚Äòhome‚Äô ‚Äì and that sense of difference was what led me to initially examine the questions of nationhood and culture that ultimately led me here.Could my children possibly emigrate and live successful lives elsewhere?  I think it‚Äôs highly questionable, because I think the situation is going to be as dangerous and uncertain for White people just as much elsewhere as in the US.  No offense to those who‚Äôve happily settled in Uruguay or Argentina, but having my future posterity be mixed race Spanish speakers is a suboptimal outcome in my opinion.All one can do is prepare as best one can, both physically and mentally, for coming travails in the short term.  In the long term, no one can predict nor possibly ‚Äòprepare‚Äô for what may happen.  The ‚Äòoption‚Äô my husband and I have chosen is to stay in the US, but relocate to an area of White heritage Americans who have a history of independence, combativeness, and survival.  We are content for now, and can only pray that we‚Äôve chosen wisely.

                I used to tease my wife about how she would buy a case of TP every time we went to Sam‚Äôs Club.  She had been doing that for years, and we had probably 4 cases (5 packages per case, 9 rolls per package)‚Ä¶maybe 180 rolls squirreled around the house.  Then COVID hit and she would laugh at me and pointed at what was probably a 3-year supply of TP.  She also had bought an extra 25lb bag of jasmine rice which got hard to find for a few months.  Suddenly, her mild bit of prepping didn‚Äôt seem so dumb.We don‚Äôt eat a lot, so the little bit of prepping we did ahead of COVID paid off.  I went to the store one day in late March 2020 when the shelves were empty.  I just needed some fresh veggies which were easy to find.  Anyway, I saw several people wandering the empty aisles with a panicked look and two items in their carts.They didn‚Äôt have any food backup to ride it out.Prepping isn‚Äôt stupid.  It‚Äôs just a natural extension of what everyone should always be doing.  Learn useful skills that you can barter ‚Äì electricians and guys that drill wells will never go hungry.  Stock up on shelf stable essentials.  TP is no joke.  Arm yourself.  Get out of debt.  Have an alternative way to power your stuff.  (If I get one battery, I‚Äôll no longer have a need for the power company.)I don‚Äôt believe collapse means the zombie apocalypse.  It might just mean empty store shelves and thieves trying to rob you.  So have a plan for that.I do think it‚Äôs easy to get carried away with it, and you‚Äôll end up with a lot of stuff thrown away.

                    Do you have any idea how completely dark it gets when there is no ambient light, like car headlights, streetlights, lights from buildings etc. I‚Äôm talking so dark that you could walk off the road into a ditch if you didn‚Äôt have a flashlight. To that end I have bought, and regularly test, hand crank lanterns with solar cells on the tops, 1 minute of cranking provides 15 minutes of light similar to a 40 watt bulb. So far it‚Äôs really working out, one is enough to see what‚Äôs on your dinner plate, milk the goats in midwinter, do homework, and find the TP in the bathroom. When I purchased them they were about $12 each, don;t know what they cost now. Apparently they work using a windup dynamo because I have looked at them from top to bottom and there is no battery slot.As an aside, how many of us remember standing up at our desks and placing our right hand over our heart and reciting with the teacher ‚ÄúI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all‚Äù.

                        We live outside the edge an urban area in Colorado and even there if I turn off the lights around my porch it‚Äôs a squint-and-step to the mailbox after dark.
I had a set of those hand crank flashlights as a kid.  Squeeze it 10-15 times and get enough just to power the bulb for 30-40 seconds.  I imagine with LED technology you can get a lot more time these days.
We have a lot of solar-powered lights.  If you don‚Äôt leave them out in the weather, the batteries last a decade or more.

And the boomers doing that aren‚Äôt going to be ruling the world with their AR-15s, the marauders will simply wait to move in until the rascal tips over and Rambo is left helplessly flailing his diabetic limbs like a flipped turtle.

                    Household solar isn‚Äôt that pricy if you just stop using your major electrical appliances, which, unfortunately, includes your coffee pot. I have two chest freezers that I‚Äôve covered with several layers of cheap extruded foam board, and it‚Äôs a negligible draw.
But unless you live somewhere far enough away that the drones won‚Äôt catch the reflection off the panels, you are not likely to be able to keep them if it really does go SHTF.

I didn‚Äôt go to quite the lengths Dad did (in the 1970s ‚Äúprepper‚Äù was called ‚Äúsurvivalist‚Äù). But I do have a collection of tinned food ca. 2020 most of which is past sell date and is slowly being eaten.

        I‚Äôm expecting housing prices to go up at least 5.4% due to expected Federal Reserve rate cuts and the stock market ETFs like VTI to return at least 10%.
Looking at housing, I don‚Äôt understand how the US isn‚Äôt on a path toward favelization, particularly with the massive inflows of third world poor just walking across the border. Concurrently with this, there‚Äôs comparatively little new housing for either purchase or rent being constructed.

                Zulu Juliet: ‚Äúliving thirty-five to a McMansion (twelve to a double-wide)‚ÄùAt some point in muh adolescence, it dawned on moi that necessarily pioneers in dirt-floored one-room log-cabins must have all slept in the same room [on account of there having been only one room, in the first place, to possibly have slept in].Then almost immediately thereafter, muh adolescent pea-brain started wondering, ‚ÄúWell then how do the youngsters get made, if everyone is in the same room?‚ÄùAnd pretty quickly muh adolescent pea-brain realized that the older children just had to lie there on the dirt floor, pretending to be asleep, whilst they listened to their parents making [what nine months later would become] their younger siblings.==========The 2006 movie, ‚ÄúThe Nativity Story‚Äù, had a scene wherein the Virgin Mary and her fambly all laid down and fell asleep on the floor for the night.==========I hate to dis da Nukular Fambly, but throwing lots of h0rny young teenagers into very close quarters with one another must go a long way towards maximizing fertility rates [although it also likely tends to maximize the genetic diseases of incest].

        Crystal ball gazing is an inherently difficult affair and one of the hazards is extrapolating on the basis of past trends. So don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself if some odd prediction comes out not quite right. Meanwhile ‚Äî and I know you don‚Äôt like him ‚Äî here is Jim Kunstler‚Äôs prognosis for the new year:

It‚Äôs bleak but plausible. I need my daily bad news to slake the needs of my pessimistic personality and this delivers it in spades.

            Arshad Ali:  Kunstler is very much a ‚Äúsky is falling‚Äù type, but still interesting to read/skim.  His personal rabbithole is ‚Äòpeak oil,‚Äô which I think is a distant ‚Äòx‚Äô to many other threats and concerns.  I don‚Äôt make specific predictions (too many areas I‚Äôm ignorant of plus I don‚Äôt think the way most other people do) but enjoy reading others‚Äô.  Plus ‚Äòdoomporn‚Äô has its own black appeal.

            The problem with Kunstler is he is pessimistic for all the wrong reasons.  He‚Äôs a ‚Äúlimits to growth‚Äù type guy.  While there is probably some truth in limits to growth, we really don‚Äôt know where they are or where we could become steady state. The only thing we know for sure is we cannot extrapolate the last 100 years very far in the future without cooking ourselves. Not by global warming, but by the waste heat of our heat engines.  Whatever happens, I don‚Äôt think any of us will ever see anything like what he proposes in his fiction books, a kind of 17th century living. Even if that eventually happens, it very likely won‚Äôt happen within our lifetimes.However, I still think he is worth reading or listening to his podcasts.  His eyesore of the month is a definite must-see.  His criticism of modern architecture is spot on.  His sarcastic tone is full of ridicule for our so-called betters. I like the way he laughs and makes fun of them.

                JHK is a master of invective, and if he‚Äôs repetitive, well, so is Z man for that matter. Guys who crank out free hardcore dissident text several times a week, while also living their lives and earning their daily bread, are to be respected if not admired. Kunstler doesn‚Äôt get lost in lucubrations about the ‚Äúdeath of conservatism‚Äù, the ‚Äúfailure of libertarianism‚Äù, the travails of internet wannabe ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù like Nick Fuentes et al, who in the real world no one has ever heard of.No. He doesn‚Äôt waste his or our time searching for sources of our crisis in the English Civil War, the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the victory of the Northern armies in 1865, or any of that. Kunstler lives and writes in the here and now; he goes straight for the jugular in his short essays on the current situation.And as for ((this)), for goodness‚Äô sake, stop. Does every writer have to score 100% on the purity test or can we just agree right now to hate everybody?

            I think we‚Äôre a nation of trust fund brats. Can‚Äôt figure otherwise. I mean, people work at home and speculate (gamble), and I‚Äôm supposed to believe that creates wealth? Yet the consumption goes on. It has to be seed corn being eaten.The idea that wealth can be conjured by fiat makes no sense. To my mind, that‚Äôs an infinite debt that can only lead to slavery, and I imagine that‚Äôs why I look around and see these people farming operations everywhere. Milk cows probably think they have it good and never realize what McDonald‚Äôs hamburgers are made of. How long until people are eating Soylent Green and loving it lol.

        I think the regime‚Äôs focus for 2024 will be on maintaining the appearance of ‚Äúnormalcy.‚Äù It‚Äôs an election year after all, and not one in which the orange man is the incumbent (for which the opposite was required in 2020). This should hold true whether or not Biden is replaced on the ballot. If he is replaced, it will be sold as normal, with a lot of LBJ comparisons. Their ability to maintain the normalcy facade will be a great test of how powerful they still are. Any big plans they have for shaking things up will wait ‚Äôtil 2025. Or at least until the latter half of November. Such as meat rationing, to save Gaia. That will be sold as normal too, since it was done in WW2, and saving Gaia is a WW2 level struggle. But that‚Äôs for further off, not for 2024.

                It‚Äôs important enough, but the news is controlled wrt these things.  Eventually it will get out, but look for the argument that this excess death rate is directly responsible *by* Covid‚Äînot the vaccine‚Äîand further that those not adhering to the ‚Äúprogram‚Äù were responsible for the spread and subsequent ‚Äúafter effect‚Äù of Covid infection.  Never however, will the government authorities accept any responsibility.  The US system is too corrupt for this ‚Äútruth and reconciliation‚Äù process.

        Tough year for many of our folk. The loss of Jeff Winston is a definite blow. We could use more men like him creating those on-ramps for dissident/pro-white topics and ideas as Zman has mentioned in the past.As it is an election year, there will be more general interest about social and political ideas dissident creators champion. It‚Äôs a good time for us all to get more involved. Not just in discussions about matters outside of our control, but doing things meaningful and uplifting for the people in our community. If anyone reading has some useful links to dissident artists, writers or content creators worth following please let me know.Hope the new year brings everyone here plenty of insight and wisdom, new and meaningful friendships and peace to you and your loved ones.

                Perhaps, but they pivoted before then in 2019.  Remember, the market started to collapse in December of 2018.  Fed started cutting rates from the ever so high of 2.5 in the spring of 2019.  By the fall of 2019 another banking crisis had begun, the did some QE but didn‚Äôt announce it.  They needed something big to really open the floodgates.  We all remember what came next.

                        I only think they were able to go higher this time because they had injected somewhere around 5 to 6 trillion in a few months in 2020.  QE from 08 ended around 2015, the fed began raising very slowly in 2017.  Yellen did a .25 raise in 2015 i think, and the market thru a fit, so she quit.  The Fed also resumed limited QE in march of this year when those banks failed.  Its only a matter of time before they destroy the currency one way or another.  QE is like a drug, each next hit has a lesser effect unless the amount is raised substantially.  Its funny and sad to have realized that back in 08.  Torture in a way, watching this all slowly unfold and not being able to do anything about it.

                        I‚Äôm more surprised housing hasn‚Äôt collapsed, but then again people are locked in a super low rates, so they ain‚Äôt moving.  And i think alot of .govs 2 trillion yearly deficits and the QE from the FED in 2020-2021 is keeping alot of corporates from laying off.  Its all politics now, fundamentals are dead and gone.

            What explains the insane market run up in Q4?  Is it pre-loading the gains that the expected rate drops will bring or can we expect even more gains when the inevitable rate drop is announced?

                ‚ÄúWhat explains the insane market run up in Q4?‚ÄùFrom what the FED has said, i‚Äôd say it was because they stated at the beginning of december they weren‚Äôt planning on any rate cuts in 2024 and then about twelve days later they said they did see rate cuts in 2024.  Usually the market drops with rates being cut.  The biggest difference between now and 2008 i would argue, is that the rest of world might be sick and tired of us and europe setting prices.  I think that was what 2020 was about.  In my opinion 2020 was the continuation of the 2008 crisis that was never fixed, but as we all know, its a confidence game, so they couldn‚Äôt admit that.  Instead they drummed up fear like post 9/11 and drove the herd where they wanted them to go.  But because the rest of the world didn‚Äôt go along and we were sanctioning russia we ended up getting alot of those printed dollars coming back here instead of the rest of the world absorbing them.  If they rate cut and print again soon, i expect the inflation to be even worse, and any gains you make on paper will not be worth it.

                That must have been an extremely expensive area. Sometimes they put a high premium on gasoline along the highways. Same in Austria or Slovenia.Normal price is around ‚Ç¨1.60. Was even lower earlier this year.

                Not sure why my response was not allowed.
Anyway, the real prices are almost a whole euro lower and have been for several months. Your experience was a freak outlier. Sometimes, they add a large premium next to highways, so maybe you paid there?

        Sundance at Conservative Treehouse has a theory about the sanctions on Russia.  He says the sanctions were not for the purpose of punishing Russia, TPTB knew that would not work.   Instead the sanctions are part of a plan to isolate us in order to invoke their digital currency scheme.   The cabal is fencing us in not keeping Russia out.
The sanctions are designed to keep us in the system.  The scam will be complete when the digital currency is enacted.   TPTB will have near complete control.

            The sanctions were clearly targeted at Europe and designed to keep it within the empire. CBDC also may be a goal, but the main one it would seem was to make the Western satrapies even more dependent. This portends to be a dreadful year, and watch Germany. The industrialists there are pissed at what has been done to them.

            It seems to me that CBDC is a plan-b and not really a goal.  Whatever problems the Dollar has, it is a major source of their power. Severing connections with the USD severs them from that power.  Tying the USD to the CBDC just brings all of the problems of the Dollar onto the CBDC. It wouldn‚Äôt give them a clean new start.  I‚Äôm pretty ignorant of finance, so there may be aspects totally invisible to me. But at best, it seems like internal control would be the only real benefit.

                They would have to announce some jubilee, which would also destroy their control.  Debt is the modern form of slavery when not used for productive purposes.  Or perhaps remove all supports that have been keeping things on life support, let people starve, and beg for a CBDC?  If people lost their jobs for a year or two, how many wouldn‚Äôt have to beg for something?  They think their 401k is a savings account‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

                I think TPTB want CBDC, but I don‚Äôt think they have fully grasped the infrastructure and human capital required to implement, operate, and maintain such a system.
The X-factor is ‚Äì do those resources still exist in the GAE?
For various reasons, I don‚Äôt believe they do.
That said, TPTB are going to do immense amounts of damage as they fail to fulfill their digital currency wish.

                    They‚Äôll likely wait to see how China manages to do it, make some half-hearted noises about it being an impingement on human rights, and then implement it anyway at the first available moment.  However, it will have none of the efficiency of China‚Äôs digital currency.

            So far crypto is behaving like ‚Äúcollectibles,‚Äù specifically trading cards, with prices moving almost meaninglessly, almost all products suddenly falling entirely out of the market, etc. Bitcoin is the big name, the Magic The Gathering of the genre. There *will be* a last guy who pays $70,000 for a Black Lotus, and soon thereafter nobody will regard it as anything but ugly old cardboard. The ‚Äúmarket‚Äù is don‚Äôt be him.It‚Äôs been an interesting test run for our future social-credit currencies. Bitcoin *is* surveillance; it has no other plausible claim to value. Who buys it? Reliably regime-obedient demographics who consider themselves otherwise. None of the ‚Äúcyberpunk‚Äù/2600/cDc guys were prescient enough to recognize themselves as The Problem.

        Pretty solid predictions. Globohomo didn‚Äôt get the Serbian regime change they wanted. But instead they got one in Poland. And their first move was to crack down on independent media. So now Poland can be properly enriched

        The future is always going to be different than we think it will be. Things will happen and be invented we aren‚Äôt expecting. So Z had a good hit rate for this year.The problem with predictions now is more than normal reality plays no important role in the worldview of the elite and managerial class. In any organization, the easiest way to get ahead now is by jumping on any bandwagon cheered by the top people. Yes, a tranny will help us sell working class beer. Yes, we can defeat Russia since it is only a gas station with nukes! On the other hand, pointing out a popular bandwagon will go off the cliff is the short path to career suicide.I won‚Äôt make predictions but I think the key issues will be:1. Do they succeed in getting Trump off the ballot? If so what are the societal consequences?2. Will the tribe and its US government continue waging 3 simultaneous wars against the tribe‚Äôs traditional enemies: Russians, Palestinians and right of center Christians? Seems as though this 3 prong war is fraying at the seams and there is a split on how to adjust.3. Will the desire to help Mother Gaia defeat the Sun God while transferring wealth to the elite and moving decisions to the global elite advance further, thus hurting the global economy, or will the rise of BRIC+ but the brakes on that outside of white countries?4. Will the desire of white women to virtue signal by destroying their nations‚Äô economies be reigned by business leaders?Should be an interesting year!

                Well, the RNC seems resigned to Trump as the nominee.  They‚Äôve canceled the remaining debates ‚Äì because it‚Äôs pointless.  There is no electoral way to stop Trump.  The usual suspects put out some puff polls for Nikki Romney, but nobody believes those.Trump will easily secure a majority of delegates by Super Tuesday in March.  He will win by margins 10% or higher than his current polling.  For base voters, this is about inflicting a political vendetta, revenge, on the Government Party.Recent feeble efforts to keep him off the ballot will not succeed because their assertion of ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù is so blindingly stupid that even the SCOTUS won‚Äôt be able to rescue them.  Those ballot controversies are for MEDIA consumption, not actual legal acts intended to keep Trump off the ballot.  You have these CO and ME Democrats looking for a way to say ‚ÄúWe hate Trump‚Äù to their deranged voting base.  Notice in both cases that they said they would stay their decision if Trump appealed to SCOTUS‚Ä¶effectively keeping Trump on the ballot as long as he submitted an appeal.  It‚Äôs a completely toothless pantomime.  Some idiots yesterday reported that CO backed down and would put Trump on the ballot.  No.  They kept Trump on the ballot because he appealed to SCOTUS just like the Democrat judges told him to.The two serious court cases (the NY and GA ones are irrelevant and stupid) probably won‚Äôt get tried until after the election.  Trump says he has immunity.  The 5th Circuit is probably going to agree with him.  If they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôll go to an en banc proceeding which will probably agree with him.  If they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôll go to SCOTUS where Trump has an absolutely stellar record of wins.  All of that will not get done fast enough for a trial in 2024‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs quite likely the two important cases get tossed because 1/6 happened when Trump was POTUS and the documents thing is the result of the Government giving him the documents that were rightfully his‚Ä¶and then demanding them back.  Which is as stupid as it sounds.  Best case for Democrats, they get their trial in 2024‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs so close to the election that even a lot of Democrat voters will see it as Stalinist and vote Biden out.The only way they keep Trump out, once these silly ballot questions are tossed, is that they will try to kill him.  In that respect, you may be right and I give it 30% odds somebody takes a shot at him and 20% odds they succeed.Oh, and he‚Äôs +5 in RCP right now with RFK Jr. in the race.  Expect Biden to do even worse as RFK takes away more votes and gets more of an audience.  RFK is the mule who will get Trump elected in November.After that?  We will see an outright rebellion by Federal Government employees.  They will refuse to go to work.  They will refuse to obey lawful orders.  A lot of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst day‚Äù is going to involve firing tens of thousands of people.If Biden wins?  Game over.  There will never be a legitimate election in this country again, and they will start a full-court press to start arresting and killing people like us.  They know what power is and they are unafraid to use it.

                    My only issue with your analysis is thinking Trump can get elected.  The only question is how many fake ballots in PA/GA/AZ/NV/MI would be so many that the media could not spin election fraud as a conspiracy theory.  He would probably have to win by 10% nationally, where several hundred thousand fake ballots in each swing state is not enough.

            Maybe not Ruby Ridge, but if Trump gains traction and energy despite the regime‚Äôs best efforts, expect a MAGA killing. Trump will disavow and then step in every regime trap laid for him.

                That would make sense if he had stepped into every trap laid for him so far.  They‚Äôve literally had to invent crimes in order to find a way to charge him.Government: Here are your documentsTrump: Thanks, deliver them to MALGovernment: OK, here you go.Government: did you put a lock on the door?Trump: No, but we have one now.Government: Give the documents back.Trump: Why?Government: They‚Äôre classifiedTrump: But you have copies of everything, and I declassified them.Government: No, they‚Äôre called ‚ÄúNational Security information‚Äù now.Trump: You made that up.  Prove it.Government: No, we can‚Äôt.Trump: Why?Government: It‚Äôs classified.  Btw, you‚Äôre going to prison for 400 years.THAT is their case.  They had to invent something and try to create a crime out of it.  I mean they literally are trying to convict him of ‚Äúinterfering in an official proceeding‚Äù when he offered more security and told everyone to protest peacfully and to go home.  First insurrection in world history where nobody was armed and they all got on their tour busses at 3pm to get home before dark.That‚Äôs not a trap.  That‚Äôs ‚ÄúShow me the man and I‚Äôll show you the crime.‚ÄùThe reason there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúVolume 2‚Äù of the Mueller Report (the obstruction of justice thing) is that they tried to entrap Trump and he successfully evaded them.The thing you‚Äôre going to see this time that we did not get last time is a purge.  A massive, massive, purge.  Trump already has a group working on it which is why the media is now whining about Trump getting ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù on his enemies.  They know what is coming because Trump is openly talking about it and he appears willing to hire the proper executioners this time.

                        Back in the late 1980‚Äôs the local meat processing plant that employed most of the town decided to turn the unused cattle parts into a sludge and spread it on their corn fields.It was like living next to an open-air cemetery during the plague.  We didn‚Äôt have A/C back then, so you had to sleep with your windows open at night in June and it was just awful.  A few years later everyone figured out that mad cow disease was being caused by inserting the nervous systems of dead cows back into the food chain, so the practice was stopped.  The family-owned plant sold out to Cargill which imported a bunch of Mexicans and the town was never quite the same.Dairy farm smells, though, always remind me of home.  It‚Äôs a weird thing to enjoy a foul smell.  Like the smell of gasoline or newly tarred pavement.

        I thought 2023 was just going to be a crappy year and was right.  The stolen-election administration doing it‚Äôs best to destroy and replace any opposition.  Every foreign policy move is the opposite of our national interests.  The economy limps along.  How bad this is gets more obvious to anyone paying attention.
2024 looks really ugly. Bad enough that I‚Äôm stocking up on ammo, seeds, and dried food.  Hope I‚Äôm wrong.

            Maxda:  I don‚Äôt want to go down the rabbit hole, and everyone has his specific theory, but between the push to eat bugs and the increasing cost of everything, not to mention last year‚Äôs drought impacting price/availability of hay so lots of culling of cattle, I believe one ought to stock forms of animal protein.  You can easily ‚Äòput aside‚Äô various grains, rice, beans etc. at what is an increased but still modest cost.  But protein and fat ‚Äì specifically olive oil and beef ‚Äì have skyrocketed.Fwiw ‚Äì I first saw mention of these a few years ago at a blog called Big Country, where I generally skim.  There is one YT channel that also mentions them and has a 15% discount code for them.  I have been surprised how many have never heard of them.  Instead of various soups/stews/casserole type things like Mountain House, they sell MEAT ‚Äì both raw and cooked.  They are a supplier for US military (midrats and LRRP). I have purchased (but not cooked/tasted) their steaks, chicken, and pork ‚Äì as well as a few veggies and specialty items (they have done name-brand outlet pizza and burgers/fries too).Check out Freeze Dry Wholesalers.

                Depressions don‚Äôt have massively inflating equity prices, housing prices, and a blue collar labor shortage.
Even from 2010 through 2019, the economy was generally improving and asset prices greatly increased.

                    It was only ‚Äúimproving‚Äù if you played their game.  That game was to rob anyone who didn‚Äôt want to gamble in the stock market of their return on savings.  Think about it, 2008 was a liquidity crisis.  What goes up in value when money is short?  If everyone is going bust and you have cash, do you lend it for 0% or do you lend it for 20%?  All the industries we‚Äôve touted the last 40 years, healthcare, higher education, do not create wealth.  They just transfer it from one person to another.  Not to mention both of those industries receive insane subsidies from the federal and state governments.  You need to be able to look at things objectively, just because it benefits you doesn‚Äôt make it good if everyone else is falling off the cart.

                        You must play the game based on the expectations of what the other players are going to do. Just because you are unhappy with the establishment doesn‚Äôt mean you should play sub-optimally. Stocking up on gold and silver to use because you want a total collapse of the current system is not a good investment, they‚Äôre fantasy investments.‚ÄòSafe‚Äô investments will never match the true inflation rate of important goods and services such as housing. Yes, people will be forced to invest in the stock market and yes, I would encourage that over becoming impoverished via fixed rate investments because Western governments will continue deficit spending and performing central bank shenanigans.

            It all resembles Boiler Room and the scene about ‚Äònigger rich.‚Äô‚ÄúGreg Weinstein : [to Seth, while driving in his Ferrari]  You‚Äôve got to realize half the kids you and I grew up with, remember in Hebrew school shoving match was a big deal? Worst case scenario somebody got their Yarmulke knocked off it‚Äôs true these guys are no joke they get all tanked up, throw a quick fist some of them actually enjoy it, like Richie what the fuck is that? Probably thought I was being tough back there with that guy, I was shitting my pants, fucking Guineas, half of them do coke, they all drink, zero capital, no fucking stability. they make all this money and always living three steps ahead, there‚Äôs guys at the firm that make a million a year but can‚Äôt even get a loan for a Honda because their credit is so bad, everybody‚Äôs just waiting for the fifteenth of the month, they may have the Porsche but they don‚Äôt have ten bucks to put in the gas tank, its nigger rich.‚ÄùWhat recession?My portfolio is a friggin rocket ship. And my advisor has me going long. The house I bought two years ago with a 3.0% note is already worth 30% more. We sold more units at work last year than ever so my bonus is looking great. My rental properties have doubled in five years and I‚Äôm jamming rent +15% this year. Prime rib from Costco at Christmas and a holiday in Hawaii on the books for this spring. Daughter got into Duke Law and my son is an absolute ace on the mound and has scouts all over him.Now I gotta go. My buddy is throwing a watch party for the Clemson game. Also, FJB!

        ‚ÄúI did not finish my book.‚Äù
An interviewer once asked Michener how he found the time to write those expansive novels.  His reply was ‚ÄúFour pages a day.‚Äù  A 1,000 page book in less than a year.
Sounds easy until you‚Äôre staring at a blank page on a typewriter (or screen on a computer in this modern age) but it sounds as though you have the discipline for it.  Put me down for a copy when it‚Äôs for sale and Happy New Year with blessings for your new abode.

            Talent is far less important than discipline as well as output. Michener left that part out. I really am a firm believer that applied discipline leads to revealed talent. The lack of instant gratification in that, though, is enough to put off most people.

                From chatgptJames Michener, the renowned American author known for his epic historical novels, was known for his meticulous research and attention to detail. While Michener did not have a ‚Äúresearch staff‚Äù in the way modern media or corporate structures might envision, he did employ a team of researchers, editors, and assistants to help him gather information, fact-check details, and assist with various aspects of the writing process.Michener often traveled extensively to the locations he wrote about, spending time immersing himself in the culture, history, and geography of each place. Additionally, he consulted numerous primary and secondary sources, conducted interviews, and gathered firsthand accounts to ensure the authenticity and accuracy of his narratives.Furthermore, Michener worked closely with editors and assistants who helped him organize his research, review drafts, and refine his manuscripts. While the exact structure and composition of his support team may have varied from project to project, it‚Äôs clear that Michener valued collaboration and the contributions of others in bringing his epic novels to life.In summary, while James Michener may not have had a formal ‚Äúresearch staff‚Äù in the contemporary sense, he did collaborate with a team of professionals and experts who played essential roles in the research, writing, and production of his expansive novels.

        Reposting three from me.  The rest are best forgotten.&gt;Iran and Saudi Arabia hold direct talks brokered by Erdogan.Brokered by the Chinese not the Turks.  They are now talking, but the Borg is engaging in reality avoidance about this, because it upends almost half a century of US policy.  Sort of proud of this call.&gt;The Daily Shoah ends after episode 1088.TDS lives, but is gasping for air (despite the wooden doors).  NJP not so much.&gt;The ADL reports a troubling upswing in whites engaging in blatant anti-defamation.This was supposed to be a gimmie.  Like predicting the sun will rise in the East.  But then Elon went and bought Twitter.  The upswing is real, and it is spectaular.My only call for 2024: by the end of it we will have forgotten 2023.
