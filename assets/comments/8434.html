            I believe this transcends race.  It is deeper than the color of one’s skin.  It is primitive and primal.  For where there is smoke, there is fire.  And behind such blatant hypocrisy, infernos rage.  Oh, the stupidity!  It burns.

                Race itself transcends the color of ones skin. There’s IQ, bone structure, similar gestation periods, even extra muscles, etc. African Americans more easily buy into grievance culture because they’ve been told to. It’s easier. Nobody tells Asians that life isn’t fair in America because of the white man, because they’re not dumb enough to buy it. They know damn well that white men would get treated just the same in their homelands, so they put their nose to the grindstone and act accordingly. Btw I heard that he’s dating some Nubian princess “Nessa” and that she is getting him to convert to Islam. Ahhh the American Dream is an Amerikan nightmare.

                        Yeah, don’t ever forget the PUSSY factor in this guy’s decision. I think he’s doing it to get laid more often. There’s no though or conscience involved. As a mulatto, his intellect just isn’t great enough to make truly principled statements, even if he had any factual basis for making them!.

        In the off-season he converted to Islam and is planning to marry some Black Berkley BLM “DJ” cvnt.
Of course, BLM is joined at the hip to Islam (plenty of proof at Breitbart on this angle).
The Conservativetreehouse makes this case very well.
Makes even more sense now, doesn’t it?

        I’m with you on “or else”. Once upon a time in America I had Negro friends, but then they became black and they were fewer, then they became AfAm and then there were none. Now, living in South America, I have a dear Brazilian friend who is very African looking, but she has nothing in common with US BLM types and in fact thinks them ridiculous.It ain’t the skin color, it’s the attitude that could eventually turn benefactors into belligerents. I’m with Uncle Max on his concise and certain judgment. Having learned the back story of this supercilious, privileged punk, my sympathies go to his adoptive parents. Too bad the silly obsession with spectator sports puts this brat in the spotlight!

            Actually same tends to the case here.  One of my kids started running track and cross country early on so we spent a lot of time at AAU meets in NYC.  Most of the kids are from Caribbean countries (you haven’t lived until you’ve heard an hour long discourse on Jamaican high school track going back to the 60s–it’s a religion).  But we were often among the few honkies in the crowd.  So one thing you picked up in the unguarded moments was that these people positively hated the local variety of African.  Thought they were lazy, spoiled, immoral…you name it.  But then spend any time on one of those islands where after tourism, scavenging the sheet metal they build everything out of seems to hold second place in the economy and you understand why they think this is a paradise.

                Funny, true African Americans—recent immigrants form African countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon or Zimbabwe, also hate American blcks as lazy, indolent whiners and slackers!
I thought it very humorous a few years ago when courts in DC were holding cab companies as “racially prejudiced”, because their black African immigrant cab drivers refused to pick up fares in dangerous ghetto neighborhoods!

        If you’re not a NFL football fan (and I suspect you’re not), you probably don’t know that Colin Kaepernick is struggling to even stay in the NFL as a legitimate player these days.  His rookie and second seasons were better than average, and his third and fourth seasons were amazing  But last season was a disaster for him and the Niners.  Poor play coupled with injury and the fact that other teams adopted to his style of play and were shutting him down.  He has spent the last 10 months “in recovery” and done little to really prepare for the 2016 NFL season.  He stands 6’4″ but if you look at him in current sports news footage and compare that image to his pictures from three years ago, you can see that he has definitely lost muscle mass, which almost certainly means loss of speed and power.  His speed and power, in addition to his throwing skill, were what made him an excellent quarterback in the 2013 and 2014 NFL seasons, and (many believed) a future Hall of Famer.  Given his current athetic and health states, it’s highly questionable he’ll even make the Niners’ offensive squad this year, never mind the Hall of Fame years from now.  Which might be the real reason why he all of the sudden got a social conscience.  After all, he said nothing about the issue of police shootings of black males prior to this NFL preseason’s game even though it’s been a hot button issue for about 3-4 years now.  I doubt he even cared about the issue until someone in his entourage told him that he needed some publicity, any kind of publicity, so that his name would be all over social media and the talking heads on ESPN had reason to refer to him aside from the fact that he is not playing.  This of course allows him to stay relevant when he’s seeking post-NFL employment.  Put another way, attention is what he seeks so that he has something to leverage another season out of the NFL and/or sports entertainment industry.  It’s the simplistic and rather desperate kind of thinking one sees in the sports entertainment world but often it gets the idiot in question paid because aside from playing football they don’t really have marketable skills, smarts or anything to offer outside the arena.

        Birth  mother white.  Sperm donor black, and reportedly “no longer in the picture” before he was even born.   His nice white parents adopted him because they’d lost two babies to heart defects.  Apparently still had two girls; wanted a boy.  Along comes Colin.

        All he had to do was stand up and the job’s done. He didn’t even have to think patriotic thoughts. In fact, he could stand there and think whatever he wanted because what goes on in this man’s head is entirely his responsibility. He could even stand there and think ‘I am only honouring (Brit spelling) all those black people I like.’ So be it.Instead he makes a gesture that he knows the majority of people who pay his wages and strive to make him feel ‘good’ will not appreciate. A small, petty gesture of defiance from someone who is prefers to make obeisance to those ‘liberals’ who, when push comes to shove, will not hesitate cut him loose and disown him.When his career is over, he can go back to his own kind and he doesn’t have to stand up for anything. May that day come soon for his own peace of mind.

            Thanks. I corrected the post.
The thing that kills me about guys like this is he is living a charmed life. A black guy in the ghetto complaining about America can be forgiven. A honky in the trailer park bitching about the minorities or foreigners is understandable. They are mostly wrong, but their condition warrants some sympathy. This guy is one of the luckiest men on earth.

        The only way to be heard nowadays is to stop spending money. When it hurts enough apologies flow. But I say, who cares? What good is a an apology when you know what someone really thinks. Reminds me of a kid who played with my son years ago. He was mean as a snake. He hit my son and his mom, exasperated, yelled at him to say he was sorry. He crossed his arms over his chest, screwed down his face and said, “You’re sorry!”

        “Whites in America have been incredibly generous and accommodating to blacks over the last half century.”Just like the whites in South Africa.  The worked their asses off, turning worthless scrub into rich farmland; everyone prospered. South Africa became the richest country on the continent.Then the whites gave in to the international drumbeat of “racist!”, and turned the gov’t over to the blacks (who were Zulu invaders, from the north; the indigenous population was destroyed by the Zulus).The result was entirely predictable: the blacks, who were GIVEN something they never earned, acted like they’d won the lottery.  They promptly wasted their good fortune, and then they demonized the über-generous whites who GAVE them the country. They trashed everything, and then began killing the white farmers. The smart whites left early on. The ones remaining were murdered outright, or driven out. Now only a handful remain. Soon, there will be none.And the international ‘community’? Total silence. Not ONE WORD from the UN about murdering thousands of white farmers. That’s genocide, no? Show me a Democrat politician who’s ever criticized that ongoing genocide. Name just one.Folks, South Africa is our future. Just replace South Africa’s blacks with U.S. communists, and you will see where we’re headed: to Plato’s utopian city-state, with a half percent in the ruling aristocrisy, controlling the 10% in the military to enforce their rule… and the rest of the proletariat slaving away to support them. And friends, YOU will NOT be among the new aristocrats. None of us will even know one of the ruling elite.Oh, they will mouth all the right platitudes: ‘equality’ (of results, not of opportunity), ‘freedom’ (to say what they want you to say), and so on. But the New World Order will be a replay of the erstwhile Soviet system: 0.5% card-carrying members of the elite, and a military that is subservient to them. The rest of us can go pound sand. IF we’re lucky. And if you think there won’t be gulags, well, the white South Africans thought their generosity would be appreciated. They thought the blacks would be grateful. But it don’t work that way in the real world…

        t has not been perfect, it never is, but there’s nowhere on earth you would rather be black than in America.Some of the former British colonies in the Caribbean come to mind as  possible alternatives to the US. They  have relatively high per capita incomes, and have less of the dysfunctional ghetto behavior of the US. As blacks are either a majority or in the case of Trinidad, are close to a majority which means they don’t have to deal with the various neuroses of being a minority. Which does exist, as any white who has lived in those countries can attest by having lived a minority life there. Barbados, Trinidad. Bahamas, Antigua. Also Bermuda.

        re: ““Our player is an ungrateful, spoiled meat head with the IQ of a goldfish”
Can’t say that about Colin Kaepernick as his Wonderlic score is a reported 38 which places him in the 98th Percentile. A Wonderlic 36 is a 132 IQ.

            I’ve administered the Wonderlic hundreds of times and I am very skeptical about the claims of correlation between those scores and standard IQ exams. I’ve been tested a lot and I know I’m not Mega Society, but I scored a 50 on the Wonderlic my first time. I know two friends that score 48 and I know they are not Mensa material.The other thing is the NFL does not administer the exam in a conventional way. The standard test in 50 questions in 12 minutes. The NFL does 5 minutes for 15 questions. Test takers tend to fade during a test so they may be goosing the results a bit by condensing it.Even so, point taken. He is brighter than the typical ball player. I’ll note that the Unibomber had a genius level IQ.

                Just had a double-tall rum-and-coke after a long day, and took the Wonderlic SAT smaple exam and scored a 38 without using a scratch pad for the math. But there are some silly things, trickster questions to see if you’re paying attention or if you’re white-knuckling and butt clenching. But I’m media borracha even now so I’m not sure I’ll gratduate or get a scholarship at htis rate.

                Embracing the cause of certain of life’s losers is Kaepernick’s way of seeking to fill the void created by his great and apparently permanent fall from football grace. Neither can bear to take responsibility for their station in life, but his agony is more acute because he once had it all. None of this would ever have happened had he stayed on top of the world.

            re: ” I’ve read that they’re [Blacks] treated especially badly in Asia but don’t know the specifics.” TimWas in Nagoya 1978 at a large cocktail party [Hundreds of Americans present] and learned two things about how Asians think about two other racial groups one of which I will say here. I heard Blacks being referred to as “eta.” The Japanese character for it is 穢多 and refers to literally, “an abundance of defilement” or “an abundance of filth,” in vulgar usage “sh*t.” A friend of mine who spoke Japanese explained it to me at the time. He had enlisted in the Navy when 17 and been discovered to have a flair for languages and was trained in Japanese. He spent his enlistment in Japan acting as a flunky carrying the brief cases and other tack of embassy officials while being the eyes an ears of an intelligence operative. No one, he said, had a clue that this young enlisted man knew Japanese. He was the proverbial Fly on the Wall.Dan Kurt

            I know that black people, and especially American blacks, are despised in the Arab countries.

        One thing I don’t get though is why do they play the National Anthem before commercial sporting events? Seems dumb. Do people play the anthem before going to the office each morning? Do the boys down at the Brake &amp; Muffler shop play it when they arrive for work?

            It’s tradition.  We don’t need any other reason than that, and that should be enough to shut up the chronic malcontents who can’t see a group of people enjoying themselves without hunting for an excuse to push them around.  WE. DO. THIS.  You, outsider, conform or get out.

                PS:  I didn’t mean “you” personally, antipater.  I was giving the general answer to anyone who comes into a community where traditions are established, and thinks that he knows better and everyone should change to suit his convenience.   I didn’t intend any insult.
