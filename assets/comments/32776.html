        The singular feature of our time is that every single institution in society is a grift, without exception. The military, education, the government, policing, medicine, corporations — all of it — is a gigantic skimming operation where the lowest priority is actually delivering a quality product efficiently.I was involved in a motor vehicle accident last year. My most significant injury was a pneumothorax. It took them about ten minutes to insert a tube in my chest held in place by one stitch. The tube was in for 24 hours. Total hospital stay – 48 hours. The bill? Almost fifty grand. They charged my insurance almost $5200 for a thirty-mile ambulance ride that required no actual treatment while in the vehicle. The guys driving the rig were probably making $25 an hour. Ten-minute CT scan was $12,000.I only paid about $2000 out of pocket because I was insured. I got great care from the hands-on providers, but it was evident to me that the entire process was a massive bilking operation by The System. Laying on the pavement injured, boy? Ka-ching!! We’ll take care of ya.When I was an adjunct professor getting paid less than $2000 per course, I once added up the tuition all the students were paying per credit-hour to be in my class. I was making eleven cents on the dollar. The diversity coordinator was making $120,000 per annum.Certainly the soldiers who took part in the 20-year grift in Afghanistan were mere cannon fodder for the military-industrial complex. The chain of command got promoted and the defense contractors made billions while the 11-Bravos were out humping rifles and dodging IEDs. I can understand why they’re all trying to score a VA disability pension.In every endeavor, the less actual work you do, the more money you make. On one hand, I do not begrudge the longshoremen for trying to increase their portion of the grift; it is simple economic rationality. But The System is basically fucked.It’s interesting if you look at the history of aviation and auto manufacturing. Those industries were founded by guys who started building airplanes and cars in their barns and painting their names on them — Ford, Dodge, Chrysler, Packard, Hudson, Nash. Boeing, Cessna, Taylor, Piper, Beech, Martin, Curtiss, Douglass, Wright. It’s literally impossible to do that today.The industries they founded employed millions in productive jobs, but eventually the industries degenerated into a racket in which it became more important to have a Negro or female CEO than build a quality product.That’s what has happened to the country as a whole. And next month we are going to get our nonwhite, female national CEO whose job will be to continue the grift.

            The same thing happened in the tech industry. The tech industry was largely founded by White guys who were building computers in their garages and used that to take over the world. The point is that they were actually making something. Now? The tech industry is largely just a middleman that sucks up data and charges companies for access to it. Any actual making is outsourced to China, with the remannts of the industry in the USA largely being used to recreate the Indian caste system here.

                “The tech industry was largely founded by White guys who were building computers in their garages.”
Maybe. . .the myth of Bill Gates as just a lowly nerd in his garage is suspect.  He and his family were and are CIA.

                    The tech industry was definitely beginning to get co-opted by the intelligence agencies by the late 1970s or so, which is when MS got going. Before that though, yea I think that characterization is broadly accurate.
Bill Gates, just by reading his biography, seems to have been a genuinely intelligent and precocious young man who was plucked by the blob to do its bidding and he was willing to play ball for the materialist riches that came with it. Many such cases, as they say.

            “I only paid about $2000 out of pocket because I was insured.”Not to detract from your fine comment, I’ve experienced the same.  However, one cannot assume that the fantastic costs you speak of are in any way paid—especially by an insurance company, any insurance company.I first got an inkling of this when I was required to sign up for Medicare.  Prior to this, I—like you—simply had such billed/sent immediately to my insurance plan.  Indeed, I rarely paid anything, or even saw a billing.After Medicare, I began to get a summary of charges submitted and charge reimbursements made.  For example, I had bloodwork done and the cost billed was maybe $1300 and Medicare paid/allowed $115!   The reason I believe I got this was that Medicare was informing me to *not* pay any secondary billing for the difference.  Those vendors taking Medicare agree to settle for whatever Medicare pays, or they are not a Medicare sanctioned provider.I understand that insurance companies have the similar agreements with providers as Medicare.  In short, the provider jacks up the bill for the insurance company and the insurance company pays a reduced amount.  It’s all a game.  So, the billings people see and rave about, here and abroad, is not the true cost of care provided.I’ve also heard from folks that billings to uninsured folk are reduced to “normal” appearing amounts, either upon immediate notification of non-insurance, or later through negotiation.  Much is hospital dependent.  Still too expensive, but nothing approaching the costs we hear about.Recently, I heard a pharmacist (we have one in the family) state how insurance claims for medicine are often not in the patient’s interest as they must bill the insurance company a higher amount for the medicine, while they could sell direct to the consumer for less.  Add in the copay required and it actually costs the consumer more than a direct sell from the pharmacy.  Further, they are not allowed to discuss such cost savings with the consumer.The system is definitely broken, but the costs involved are grossly exaggerated in this “Kabuki” farce we call American medicine.

                Yes, quite true. I believe my insurance company settled the amounts for less than billed.
Seems to me then, that the providers are either a) trying to find insurers or patients stupid enough to pay what they ask and rip them off, or b) running some kind of accounting scam where they cam claim “losses” at tax time…

                    When I was helping my dad decide whether to become a Medicare provider, the catch was a phrase something like “reasonable and customary”. Because we lived close to a reservation, over half of his work was charity or at best a couple dozen eggs, or a pair of tooled boots or, for major things, maybe a saddle. That’s a whole lot of zero amounts to try to average in to a “reasonable and customary” figure Medicare was going to base reimbursement on…

            Similarly, in a lot of fields there is now a paradigm of “the less hands-on experience you have, the more you know.” This started with the ‘animal rights’ scam (because clearly some activist knows more about how to wrangle cows than any farmer possibly could) but has since spread far and wide.

            Excellent points but I question your wrap-up about Harris getting into the White House. I actually think the Dems may be suffering from hubris and that recent events may actually derail their fortification efforts. There are two things in particular that people won’t forget on election day.First of all, the administration is totally ignoring the devastation in the South caused by the hurricane. They’ve literally sent no one to check on it. This sends a loud message to heritage Whites and southerners – the administration does not care about you. There’s every indication that Kamala plans to ignore most of the country in fact and campaign in her coastal strongholds.Then there’s the port strike. This is going to remind a lot of unionized Whites of how little the regime cares for them and their vanishing jobs. I actually think the administration might be stupid enough to “pull a Reagan” and try to replace the strikers with scabs, even better if the scabs are immigrant scum too. Then there’s the supply chain issue. The more disruption it causes to the supply chain the more the memes will fly – “Kamala cancels Christmas!”These aren’t issues that can guarantee a Trump win but together they put a little on the scales in his favor. There are lots of swing states that are either in the South or in heavy union states in the midwest. If the fortification machine is less robust this time around these events may swamp it and give Trump the win.BTW, none of this is meant to imply that Trump is going to do anything if he wins. I fully expect nothing from him other than simply not being Harris. I also plan to enjoy binge-watching the videos of Lefty freak-outs and agonized screaming again just like in ’16.

                My financial advisor, based in San Francisco and working for Wells Fargo, called me on election night in 2016, ‘to see how I was handling the news’.
We’d never talked any kind of politics. She assumed I would need bolstering.
I played dumb and went into rhapsodies about the results, as if I assumed she was on my side. Went on at length about how the markets would respond, didn’t let her get a word in for a while.
Then I found some new advisers.

        “Harris, on the other hand, does not have any good options on this one.”
I blew my coffee out of my nose reading that sentence.
The implication being that she sees a problem, understands it, and thinks about what options are available to her.
Honest to God, does any sentient being think that creature is able to do that?

            im re reading Augustine’s confessions and I wonder about these personal crisis that many people have. Just because she is  very late middle age, I think she is 60 or something, does not mean she can’t have a moment of “what is all this for?”I wonder if any serious public personality has ever had this kind of personal crisis, a crisis of “am I believing in true and good things?”She seems so shallow and frivolous but how long can people keep that up? It’s possible the pressure for her to not think and do as she’s told is too great to overcome possible doubts about the direction of her life.

                There is a clip out there of Kamala talking about a restaurant she wants to open. Unlike when she talks about, say, inflation (or anything else), she seems to actually have a plan and vision for the restaurant and it seems to be something she actually enjoys. A real person shows through in that clip in the way it doesn’t when she did, say, the speech at the DNC. So, the obvious question is, why does she need to do all this stuff, why not just retire and go open the damn restaurant and enjoy the rest of your life?

                        People can find motivation and pleasure in work when they do something they actually enjoy. Maybe if she was doing something she wants to do, she would find that motivation. The point is, it seems like there is clearly something she would rather be doing than girlbossing the US government, so she should do that.

                            No, I’m not. The point is, she wouldn’t rather be running a restaurant just because she shows a little enthusiasm for the topic. People do that all the time: talk about a future they find interesting but which they’ll never actually pursue. She’s where she is because she’s been groomed to be a political puppet all her life and that’s what she knows.

Stop thinking everyone shares the same paradigm as you. They don’t. Many would sell their soul for a taste of fame and fortune. “Waking up” and having an “Ah Ha” moment would sully the waters.

                    Yes.  Smart, honest, sensitive people have a tendency to assume that everyone has a similar inner life.  I don’t think that this is true.
Instead, many people’s inner lives are closer to sharks or snakes than to what many of us experience inside.
In a broader sense, this mistake leads us to assume that there is a singular human nature shared by all humans.  This is mostly untrue, especially when you include Africans.  Besides disliking pain, maybe the only feature shared by all humans is a predisposition to love your Mom.

            Harris won’t even visit North Carolina for an Air Force 2 tarmac meeting with the Governor and National Guard, demanding $$$ and aid for wiped out Americans.
For the current strike, it’s insane she’s not on TV saying the “Biden Administration” is contemplating ordering a 90 day “cooling off” period, which would get her past the election.
I’ve never seen a politician with worse political instincts.

                If you followed the going-ons from the Imperial Court the past few years, one thing that consistently came out was that Harris’ office was in bad shape. There was lots of turnover, lots of gossip, lots of leaks, and far, FAR from the best people in there. I know that a VP office is never going to attract the best people (simply because the VP is, more often than not, not a real job), but Harris’ was notable for its shoddy condition. And it’s not like the Biden people, who, at least from a political point of view, are pretty competent, are going to step up and help the person and the operation that just committed a palace coup against them.

                        The personality is probably even worse than the brains.
I am still stunned that the media has successfully presented this truly terrible human being, who is unusually stupid and treats others so poorly, as competent and “joyful.”
I still don’t think most dissidents appreciate the power of the media to create reality and morality for at least half the people in our country.

                            True. If the media, over a long period of time, insisted the moon was actually a very large wheel of Camembert, the masses would clamour for a large-scale space mining operation and to be supplied with unlimited free Triscuits. And I’m not joking.

                            They see themselves as sorcerers who practice magic; they can conjure reality by saying the right things. It is entirely consistent with the mystic elements of the religion many in the media hold. It is part of the whole “manufacturing consent” operation that has been in place for over 100 years (“Remember the Maine!”). It is entirely consistent with MK Ultra and the mass psychological warfare the US government wages on its citizens starting in the 1950s. It’s a total control operation, and we are all victims to it.

            No doubt Harris is a blithering idiot and the dumbest person imaginable, but this obviously applies to her handlers as well when you tack on her botched response to the hurricane. The world has changed dramatically in the eight years since the Obama bot’s puppeteers were in charge, and it shows. It also indicates a dramatic diminution in the quality of the Ruling Class that hires the Help and Ho’s who hold public office and pretend to represent others.It is an open question whether Harris can read and comprehend. It is a problem when the pimps who pay her to turn tricks also appear unable to do so and the johns who pay for the action don’t notice, especially when we are on the brink of nuclear war.

                You and ProZNov are correct. Visiting the hurricane sites is a layup that any politician with an IQ above room temperature would figure out.I forgot about the notion of a 90 day cooling off period. A no brainer that would get her past the election, and show the ability to handle big issues.But nope. With respect to the disaster areas,Trump is there, looking all “Presidential” and stuff.
Its frankly breathtaking how inept her and her team are.

        It’s hard to get fired up over this.  In another age it would be a big deal, but when it comes to thieves within the regime the dock workers are pikers, after all they do kinda sorta show up for a job unlike most of the rest of the looters.

        US non-labor workers are left with “asking nicely” on an individual basis in the face of global competition, offshoring of everything manufacturing, and infinity immigration of both skilled and unskilled labor. How’s that been working out?Reagan, more than anyone in my lifetime, shifted public opinion against unions with his mass firing of air traffic controllers in 1981. This was unquestionably the correct action at the time. (I have some personal family history with this)HOWEVER, he was dealing with a critical infrastructure org that was being choke held by a PUBLIC SECTOR union where it was literally illegal to strike.There is a world of difference between PRIVATE sector unions and PUBLIC sector unions. The former is fine and should be encouraged; the latter should be illegal. Yet here we are, the opposite being effectively true.Private sector labor unions aren’t angels, but collective bargaining is the only tool most blue collar, middle class employees will ever have. It’s leverage…they can overdo it at their own peril (and have), but generally can be a net positive for the working man.Now? Everyone hates unions at the same time we have a record number of billionaires and one guy (who I like) who’s on track to be the first trillionaire.

            Reagan did have a couple of “advantages” with the air traffic controllers strike. They signed non-strike provisions (IIR) and Reagan had a reserve of military controllers to fill in the shortfall from the firing. My memory may be faulty.
What I do remember, I had a good friend whose wife was an air traffic controller, was that they ostensibly complained of all sorts of work environment problems, like stress and hours, etc, but basically what kept them out was the *money*. $$$ solves all such problems it seems.

                I don’t think that’s it. The problem is, always has been, and probably will always be scarcity.
If the dockworkers get paid more, it does not appreciably increase their production. The goods at Walmart got more expensive, so the Americans working other jobs can’t afford their lifestyle. Some drop out, allowing their brothers to raise their wages. Which is passed on in higher prices of the things they do. At best, everything stabilizes at a new, higher level, but with more Americans on the dole.
And who wins? Gov and the financiers, who get their skim on every transaction.

                        True. A 5% vig on $2000 is better than a 5% vig on $1000. That’s why they target to create inflation, and why we are trained from an early age to fear deflation. Lower prices? Heaven forfend!

            The thing with private sector unions is they are only good for society if they are widespread. The vast majority of labor is not unionized today.  So it kind of creates this special class of workers who are well compensated while the vast majority of their peers are not.  With “free trade,” they are always threatened by the company’s ability to offshore all the production.
The thing with public sector unions is there is nobody defending the interests of the people paying the bills. Most of them aren’t even blue collar workers.  They always show up at clownworld protests.

                    The problem seems—as you’ve astutely pointed out—we are squabbling among ourselves too often.  That coupled with some outrageous union leadership as we’ve seen is no help to the cause of unity.
There was an item I saw a while back about the bus drivers in Japan who went out on strike.  They never missed a day of work.  They simply drove and picked up riders, but collected no fares from the passengers!
As I said, you want a fight, then just keep letting that longshoreman union head keep talking for your membership.

                            No, but it’s the mentality of the action and the demonstrated unity with the public that depends upon their service.  I’m betting there’s never been a strike in Japan where their chief spokesman threatened the public with ruin if they don’t get their increase.Lineman, you can’t have it both ways.  You can’t have a low life threatening thug run your union negotiations and have a supportive populace.  You want to talk tough, you do so behind closed doors around the negotiating table.  You then go out to the news media and plead your case to the public.I once had such a situation where I was on a Board of Directors and one of our members threatened the Board upon making a request.  First time the Board had even heard the request from this member.  Well, we thanked him and said we’d take it up for discussion and vote before next monthly meeting.  At end of meeting we, to a man, rejected even considering his request.  No further discussion necessary, we simply do not consider positive responses to threats.I suspect the Longshoremen have achieved the same effect with the general populace, whereas they might have had some support prior to his big mouth opening.  That coupled with the revelation of the salaries currently made and the average working Joe sees little to be sympathetic to.

                    Well, the first part of any solution is to have a real economy.  We also need to stop importing millions of people who drive down the wages of our workers.  We should probably stop subsidizing low wage workers. (people with full time jobs on food stamps or section 8 or other social welfare).I don’t oppose unions. I generally support them.  But at this point, the lack of unions really isn’t the problem.Most of all, we need protective tariffs and other barriers to trade so we have more high value added production.  A lineman really cannot have their job off-shored to China, so presumably you are not facing that risk.  High wages just cause off-shoring in most cases. It’s not just wages, but they do play a major role. We aren’t losing to foreign competitors, we’re losing to supposedly “American” companies who do their manufacturing in other countries and then bring them in tariff free or near tariff free.  As long as this is an option, they’re gonna do it to every job which it can be done.But I generally oppose unions in unproductive jobs.  I’m not saying you are doing it, but a ton of leftists constantly promote unionization as the solution to the Walmart or McDonald’s problem.  Unionization of this type of job will just raise prices.  It’s just a different route to a higher minimum wage.  Productive people generally don’t make minimum wage. Producers can pay them more because they add a lot more value.

The problem with protectionism of any flavor is that the industrialists pocket the money at the expense of the people who buy those products.
In theory, I guess you could probably come up with an optimal tariff, but, you are counting on the government to do it? Really?

            IMO, big unions are part of the kabuki theater.  They get their dues then do a periodic make-believe dance with the management over the contract to show the rubes they’re working for them.  It’s all made-up crap to give the plebes a $1 raise while inflation increases another 50%. . .

                    And that works until everyone else does it. Once you push up the amount of money, you have the “too much money chasing too few goods” problem. Like we saw with Covid Cash.
What you really want is for corporations to invest in more capital equipment, so they create more goods, and, at the margin, push down goods prices.

                            No, only if they had to lower prices because someone offered a lower price on a good they produced. That’s why consolidation must be avoided and/or TR-era trust-busting is an essential element.
Like it or not, Covid Cash (and regulation of evictions) did bid up the price of housing. And, as a result, everything else. What they did not spend on rent went into bidding up the price of other goods.
Just stop already. Or better yet, learn ECON 101.

        Container ports are almost mythical amongst a certain set of people…they are the very symbol of globalization and the curse of liberalism…they say that with every container that’s unloaded, a boomer says “This will make the Chinese Democratic.”
Furthermore, their existence has also ruined skylines and harbor views. If I lived in Miami or New York, I’d be pissed that I pay $8000/mo for a high rise that with “a harbor view” that looks over shipping containers filled with pants from XINGHUA LINGUAN TROUSERS COMPANY LTD.

            I love ports. I love giant stevedores in silhouette against the sunset, smokestacks sparkling at nighttime like an elvish city. Behemoth Asian ships sailing off to the other side of the world.What is modernity for us will one day be a genre for others, like steampunk or goth. People will tour preserved or reconstructed ports of our time centuries hence and go woooaaaah.

        Well, when you’re run by a transactional people, your economy will eventually become a transactional economy.
Our current rulers have never been a productive people. It’s just not how they think. They look to the financing and merchant side of the economy to make money. Annoying, but not the end of the world as long as the productive people are in change. But those days are long gone.

        China has fully automated its large port at Tianjin, near Beijing. But beyond automation, it is running AI on 5G bases to optimize the automation. The result is that the port can unload or load a large containership in a few hours, a process that takes days at our antiquated ports.Of course, the result is that there are hardly any workers at Tianjin Port.I am old enough to remember the (actual in many case) bloody fight to prevent containerization. That fight was lost, and union membership fell substantially.In general, China’s factories are highly automated, and the automation is optimized running AI on 5G. China has something ⅔ of all the world’s industrial robots and 4/5 of all the world’s 5G base stations.For some details regarding Tianjin Port, see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5kO_BnXAwcFor a vision of our very dark future, see Kevin Walmsley on “Inside China Business,”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXpMiNpek64Chinese universities now dominate all engineering disciplines and physical science disciplines both in terms of quantity of high quality publications and patents and in terms of the quality of the education offered.Tuition, fees, room and board at Chinese universities amount to about 1/10 of costs at American universities.

            “Chinese universities now dominate all engineering disciplines and physical science disciplines both in terms of quantity of high quality publications and patents and in terms of the quality of the education offered.”Yep.  I said this a few years ago to the objection of many of the commenters here.  Long past, there was any number of our faculty publishing jointly with Chinese associates.  I even specifically inquired of one as to how he liked the collaboration and the difficulties in such—distance, language, etc.  At that time, he was enthusiastic.  Chinese faculty were almost all proficient in written English and many trained in the West.  It was a non-problem.

            Bob Sykes – appears we are / were in similar business.  I am / was a big exporter &amp; now consult with 3 PL’s.  You are spot on re: automation.  US port productivity is worse than some ports in Africa.  Not remotely in the same league as the PRC, or ports like Rotterdam.  Daggett (ILA prez) has been itching for this fight for some time.  He’s aware of the huge cash inflow’s post Covid supply chain snafus that went to MSC / Maersk / CMA – et al and wants his share (fair or not).  Watch some of his videos – “I will cripple you”, “mu guys were on the dock dying during Covid”, etc.  I get that he’s fighting not just for pay – but mostly to maintain the (mostly) work jobs of the rank and file.I wonder sometimes it ss line management would better off to pay a certain amount of money to the ILA and have the guys stay home, and in return but let them automate a la Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningbo, etc.

            The internet letting the masses speak for themselves has confirmed all my prejudices except one.I thought it was bullshit, but it turns out that the average conservative/libertarian really does want to see normal people get ripped off at the store, scammed by the landlord, mistreated by management, impoverished by finance, cheated out of pay, bound by contracts without consideration, chiseled on every transaction, etc.All your “crushed under the boot of capital” type stuff, from the largest in scope to the smallest,ispornography for them, just like the commies said. The leftmade it upand were right—or maybe they conjured it by describing it.“You’re that Jew from the poster. You know the one. Put the mask on.”“OK.”

        “What we learned from the Covid fiasco is that American supply chains are extremely fragile…”That is putting it lightly.  The supply chain for products is like a Rube Goldberg machine.  Chinese company manufactures, a Filipino guy does graphic design, an Indian woman does customer service, banking in Hong Kong, Becky from the USA has to run to China for quality control and self-actualization, and on and on, ad absurdum.I may be stupid, but it seems like good common sense to, you know, just make things here so as not to be dependent on this easily breakable system.  But can’t do that, it would interfere with “muh free trade and muh free markets.”

        One of the first things that will happen is conservatives will be told by conservative ﻿media to blame the dock workers.I’m wondering if we’re going to see a lot of the GOP establishment types running to the mikes in coming days to bad mouth the union workers. They must know that Trump is getting a lot of “blue collar” support, and trashing the Archie Bunker-types working on the loading docks is a sure way of turning them off the GOP and possibly a way to help throw the election to Kamalatoe.It’s on a par with their regular promises to cut Social Security when they want to lose an election. While they know it will never happen – and they’ll certainly never attempt to cutanyspending themselves – they also know it will p*$$ a lot of people off and keep them from voting Republican.

        “In a way, the ports are a good model for our ruling class. Everyone involved in the ports is doing well, better than they should expect, but everyone involved in the ports is sure the system is screwing him. That is because the ports exist in isolation from the rest of the economy. It is a world unto itself that only interfaces with the rest of society, rather than operate within the economy. It is how high-earning people on both sides of this strike can think they are the little guy.”Exactly, Union and government/government contractor “workers” who think they’re being screwed when really they’re protected from market forces. They’re not competing with nearshoring in Monterrey or cheap Illegal labor outside the local Home Depot. They’re awash with cash. They generally don’t work hard, have a ton of perks and privileges – and yet a lot of them still cheat on their taxes! Just an entitled, bloated class. See also: U.S. Military.

            The military is a tremendously entitled class with salaries and benefits beyond in the officer, career NCO class especially. The worse part of it is their total isolation from the real world. I kind of exempt the boots on the ground grunts, but not wholly. The service academies were captured long ago and even the junior officers are just as pozzed as the worst corporate drones at Google. The ones that aren’t are just holding on for their pensions.

        I’m guessing that someone within the union is extorting concessions- both political and financial, from the Democratic Party and the Regime, as more chaos in the economy obviously hurts Vac-U-Suck and her Party.  So what is the angle here? Do the Longshoremen want Trump elected? Or are they simply flexing their power on a desperate Democratic Party to ensure that soon to be President Harris knows not to touch them? Or are they playing both sides at once, which is what I think is likely?

                Yep. Both major political parties are corporate subsidiaries now, so unions see little advantage to whichever puppet is put into place. Z probably is onto something about “Biden” nicely knifing Harris a little here. There have been 11 presidential elections since the last Longshoremen strike, if I’m counting right, and the NLRB and Commerce and every department averted one happening. When Biden rather than “Biden” is semi-competent, he is a very nasty and petty bastard, and this may be a dementia patient flinging poo by telling everyone who could avert a strike to stand down and let the clean and articulate colored lady get splattered. And “Biden” is just as nasty and petty and this may be them.

            Admittedly, my knowledge of ports is limited to my 20 year old recollection of Season 2 of “The Wire”, but it does seem like the union is leveraging the administration, or at least Harris. There will probably be real pain by Election Day if this doesn’t get solved.
For all his faults (or perhaps because of them) Trump is beloved of the gods.

        The biggest impact of the port strike (particularly if it lasts for several weeks) will be felt in China. Their economy is still tethered to US consumerism and that cash flow will grind to a halt and force slowdowns in their manufacturing sector. That does not bode well for debt service payments and looming bankruptcies that may ensure. Ditto for German industries that also rely on US markets and are barely holding on by a shoestring. Could the port strike by the first domino to fall? Inquiring minds want to know.

            My impression wrt Germany is that they have been, themselves, offshoring their jobs and production.  Less out of greed like us, but more out of desperation due to government policy.  Of course nothing helps if there’s no one with money to buy.

                Yes, but we also offshored because of government policies.
Unless you are in a low margin business like grocery stores or commodities, labor costs are trivial. The high cost is in compliance and whenever you have to fire someone with or without cause. That’s what bankrupts you.

                Yes, but they are a fraction of the East Coast and Gulf, and cannot offset the difference. China will still lose more than half of its market due to the strike. Their economy is more tenuous than most realize. This is still a huge shock for them. For example, more that 2/3rds of all Walmarts are served via the Eastern and Southern port system.

                    Indeed. The geology of the West coast is just terrible for ports in general. Lots of hills and mountains rising right out of the sea and deep water just offshore. The East coast has nice flat coastal plains, shallow bays, and easily dredged harbors.

        Reminds me of the 2nd season of the wire.
I may someday go back and watch the first few seasons. I think I watched it first before I was  a dissident and it contained one of those phrases that threw my political beliefs off:
we use to build things here
of course just having read a bio of TJ, I was thrown off again as he wanted all manufacturing to be done in Europe. So I guess Jefferson would approve of the current American economic set up, hehe

            Just re-watched the entire series after watching season 1 on a long plane ride.  I was surprised that it holds up well and is still entertaining and suspenseful.  Obviously, the pagers and pay phones serve to make it a period piece, but the essentials of Charm City (Balmer) haven’t changed much.

        Over 60 million employees in the US cannot even access the court system. They are forced to sign arbitration agreements!
All this arbitration crap needs to be outlawed by Congress.  The House passed something called The Fair Act which outlawed both consumer and employment arbitration clauses back in 2019, but I guess it died in the Senate.
WHY are we forced to fund the courts if we aren’t allowed to use them?

                    I didn’t downvote you, but the flaw in the logic is libertarian lalal land. Someone who has been job searching for 6 months with a couple of kids and the desire to feed, house and clothe them are indeed forced through economic circumstance to do it. With so many employers doing it now, choices are limited.Let me point out another evil in this system… Some 9 year old agreed to uber-eats TOS. The parents years after the fact got severely injured in an uber in NJ. The NJ supreme court just held up that this couple cannot sue for even their medical bills because of that BS in the uber eats TOS. This is in the news right nowDisney killed a woman at the Disneyworld and claims a trial membership of Disney Plus where they agreed to a TOS years before the trip to Disney World exempted them from a wrongful death lawsuit. Only public outrage led to Disney granting an exception (the courts upheld this BS). This was in the last few months.Preventing Americans from accessing the court system is an outrage. These contracts of adhesion involving arbitration should be made illegal. Much of the stuff you buy and growing by the day are forcing arbitration agreements. They are all doing it or will be soon.

I get that choices are sometimes difficult. I’m not going to claim I went 6 months, because I’d too driven to wait that long for anyone. That’s why I’m on record here multiple times suggesting people get a side hustle or full on business going. So that you are not compelled to do what some hysterical moron says.
Courts, maybe. I avoid them as much as possible. Cost/benefit in the best of cases is crap.

                    A lot of the people who will fall victim to AI are not exactly replaceable though. This is just the latest episode of a very unfunny sitcom the ruling class has been making for us for decades. Each episode begins and ends the same. They start with something (good or service) that was high quality and made in the US. Around the time of that first commercial break they find some idiot foreigners in Shitlandistan who can kinda sorta do the thing in a half or 3/8 assed way. The results suck but they’re cheaper to the consumer and most importantly, to the corporations. Jobs are offshored, people start drinking or drugging themselves to death, you know, hilarity ensues. The show ends with a scene of the executivesbehind it allcashing their multi-million dollar bonus checks, jetting off to party on Epstein’s island, and cracking jokes about all those dumb unemployed hillbillies.

                        Fair.
If so, it creates an opportunity for you (or any greedy capitalist) to hire these people back into these irreplaceable roles. Just as you can hire those people who were allegedly displaced by Haitians.
Honestly, I don’t know whether people were displaced by Haitians. But if they were, wouldn’t a company who hired those displaced workers be at a competitive advantage?

        There are strange things happening down at the Circle K.Someone from the Harris campaign should have pushed in a “fix” to push this down the road. That they did not either says they have the election in the bag via fraud, or are so down in the polls why bother? Biden certainly let this happen, or rather his people, and they are not looking for new jobs either which is weird, one way or another they would be replaced by either Trump or Harris.There are a ton of articles from the NY media, the Times, New Yorker, New York Magazine plus statements from Fran Leibowitz, that the Constitution and Supreme Court “no longer work” and have to be abolished. Or just ignored. Ground preparation for a Biden led coup? Declare the election “invalid” like Zelensky and just rule forever? Don’t know.There is no rush by Harris, the easy play, to get food, supplies, and troops for security to North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and other places hard hit. Its the easiest campaign commercial in the world. Have her down there, ordering stuff happening, personally hand out food/water/clothing, hug people. Have military comms available to civilians, etc. Instead its Trump doing that — teaming up with Elon Musk to provide Starlink access to those areas particularly North Carolina with maybe in excess of 1,000 dead (many places have no comms at all). [Asheville and places like it voted 58% for Biden in 2020, so in theory it would be a no-brainer to shovel lots and lots of resources there to show the utility of voting Democrat.] So strange there has been basically nothing but Biden saying he was “commanding” and on the phone for 2 hours that’s all they get.Now Iran is firing missiles into Israel, and the US is looking to get sucked into fighting Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, and possibly Russia and Iraq in the Middle East. Its weird that no one in the Administration sought to prevent this by spreading cash around freely and without reservation.Its as if the entire Democratic Party and the ruling bureaucracy just took a vacation for the fall. Its weird, unsettling, and indicative of either an Obama-led coup to keep Biden in the White House forever or his own person in the seat. Either way its not normal.

            This is crazy, I agree! If there is that kind of profit, how could capitalists not be seeking to get a cut of that?
Of course, the answer is after the government’s take their vig, there’s not enough left over to make it worth the risk.

        Is there a reason why replacing the federal income tax with a federal sales tax wouldn’t be a fantastic idea? Serious question.As always, I’m dumb about this stuff, but wouldn’t it encourage people to be industrious and frugal instead of lazy and consumerist? Wouldn’t everybody pay their fair share, even have a say in what their share is? Wouldn’t it be more moral than telling people to work and punishing them for working? Wouldn’t it be more in line with the federal government’s commission to regulate trade? Wrt to the topic, wouldn’t it ultimately tilt incentives in the direction of industry and exports?That last part is the best reason I can think of why not, or maybe that it would complicate wealth redistribution. I mean, our economy is rotten. Industry and agriculture beats banking and real estate every time, then again, I guess that depends on how you see it and how you make a living.

            I agree Brother Tariffs and a Sales Tax only on manufactured goods would be my way of funding states and the federal government which would be more than enough and probably even have a surplus because I would cut at least 75% of existing government if not more and do away with the federal reserve… Thing of it is we don’t have the power to do so and because of our individualistic nature/all that entails probably never will…Sad That…

Once they repeal the 16th, let me know. Until that, I want no new taxes.

            No, this would be evil.  A consumption tax sounds good in theory, but the average person is spending most of their money and so are paying the highest tax as a percentage of their income.We don’t all benefit equally from the government either.  The wealthy are the ones tying up the courts, they are the ones getting government money (think Musk).  Farm aid is government cheese for John Deere.Ideologies like free trade have decimated the US economy.  You can lie about statistics, but you cannot lie about tax receipts.I do support tariffs, so long as they are high enough to protect American workers.  People love to go on about free trade, but we don’t have trade hardly at all, let alone free trade. The August balance of trade deficit was 80 billion USD.  There are only 18 countries in the world with a GDP larger than our yearly trade deficit.  Much of this “trade” is actually American corporations importing goods they made somewhere else like China. Think of the iPhone for example.Trade can be great.  We can import foodstuffs out of season or we can import minerals or things made from minerals we are not blessed with having.  There might even be a “comparative advantage” in certain industries beyond wage and regulation differentials.  But trade is a 2 way street.  You export some goods to earn foreign currency to import other goods we cannot make ourselves or not efficiently.  Instead, we borrow money from the foreign country and use that borrowed money to pay for the imported items. we mostly send back either empty containers or items at the very bottom of the added value chain, like unprocessed cotton and the like.

                The major problem, IMO, is that .GOV always rides in to destroy anything America does. America could and would have started producing the Willys Jeep, using plans from WWII, and probably tens of millions would have been sold in the very first year, but regulators would not permit it on the roads.
Just look at the hassle that they put kids through for opening a friggin’ lemonade stand! They are bound and determined to destroy everything, everything, that made America great.

                    Depends on how you look at it. Income tax discourages capital accumulation.
Sales and use taxes have the effect of encouraging savings, i.e., capital accumulation. So while “regressive”, if you care at all for the future generations, the sales and use taxes are better than an income tax.

                        I should add, the upsides of sales and use taxes are only realized to the extent you disavow death taxes. If one wants to tax inheritance, particularly at the exorbitant rates in the modern US, the incentive is to destroy any savings one has, c.f., the caricature of Boomers spending everything before they die.

                This is basically it. Consumption taxes end up placing the greatest tax burden on the poorest people. It actually ends up being the reverse of the income tax, which at least takes more from those who have more and are thus less hurt by it. Also, you could never fund a bloated government like ours this way without having something ridiculous like a 250% sales tax.Sure, the government is too big, etc… The time to fix our tax system and pare down the federal government was 50 years ago though. Just preventing nuclear war and civil war is going to require all the strength and ingenuity we (probably don’t) have.

Nonsense! The income tax takes from those who want to become those who have more.

                        Oh, I believe you. The idea I was criticizing was that we can fund our current bloated government with consumption taxes and get rid of income tax. The only way to do this would be to raise consumption taxes through the roof.

                            That’s true. It would represent a reorganization of society, but we’re in sore need of one.

        Increased costs at the ports are a de facto tariff, so I suppose I hope the strikers win out.  I support maximum possible autarchy for all nations.  Cross-border arbitrage seems to be just a tool to set all the world’s working people in competition for the basic necessities of life.  This is not as evil as bringing in outsiders, of course, but in my view it’s a sign of ingratitude.In the West, the nuveauriche imagine that all their success is due to their own virtue or cleverness and are blind to the cozy environment created by their people and society.  In other parts of the world their lack of existing connections to power holders would defeat them before they could begin.  I recently saw this attitude on full display, in a ‘tweet’ stating that you could drop a billionaire in the jungle with nothing and he’d simply become a billionaire again by his own heroic mastery of business.  It was both hilarious and nauseating.

            If anyone has not heard sound bites from this guy, stop and listen.  He brings back memories (bad) from the 70’s.  He not only threatened the USA with shutdown, he challenge the Fed’s to call a 90 day return to work cool-down period!  He said as near as I can remember, “…so call a 90 day return.  You think our members are going to go back to the job and work like they used to?”  In short, he threatened an illegal “slow down”!I now remember why I had no use for Unions when younger.  I respect Lineman, but can’t accept Union thuggery like that man displays.

        Paying the Bridge Troll﻿Automation and the Port Strikehttps://semperdoctrina.substack.com/p/paying-the-bridge-troll“In the old Norwegian tale, “Three Billy Goats Gruff” (De tre bukkene Bruse), three male goats need to outsmart a ravenous troll to cross the bridge to their feeding ground.”“Those salad spinners have to come over a bridge – – THE PORT SYSTEM. There are three bridge trolls – – THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE MONOPOLIST LABOR, AND THE MONOPSONIST PORT OWNERS. The three trolls are merely fighting over who gets what share of the toll!”“I meditated on this a bit, as well: If the three trolls have a good thing going, why fix it at all? You don’t really need to, do you? The trolls probably won’t fix this. The beneficiaries of an improved, efficient logistics and supply chain are the goats, not the trolls!”

            Two portions caught my eye;
“any support in Europe for the Confederate Cause.”“…in particular, the Lancashire cotton workers…”
“Leftists that took part in the socialist and communist revolts in Europe in 1848-49 flocked to this country from 1849 through the 1850s as they were run out of their own countries as well as other European countries that did not want left-wing revolutionaries on their soil.Many of these joined the Union army, thousands of them, in fact.”

        I’d do what Coolidge did with the Boston Police. I’d fire them, bring in the National Guard (to do something at home – not abroad), and then train new workers with a new contract that guarantees their employment against automation. If former union members want to sign back up – fine, but I’d make rules that limit their ability to reorganize.I would not allow them to shut down the economy for an outlandish a 75% raise over five years. Who gets a raise like that that? It’s nothing other than pure extortion on the backs of the taxpayers.Under somewhat different circumstances Margaret Thatcher did the same thing with the coal miners in 1984 when they went on strike to prevent closures. She understood that the excessive cost of coal production was a drag on economic growth. One could say the same about the Longshoremen’s demand for a raise. It is passing costs off to consumers who (if you are not living in the woke world of Washington DC and its corporate state clients – universities, unions, finance, tech, business, and the MIC among others) are struggling to survive.As in Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s, the USA needs some “shock therapy” combined with a specific end to the corporate marriage between business and government. K-Street has to go.

                        What? Where did that come up?
The closest I know was when I said how hard it was to hire a white boy who would pass a drug test, which is the case whether or not you like it.
Tell me, @lineman, are there any non-whites in your brotherhood?
If so, what does “brotherhood” mean? What was the point?

                            Honestly, that’s an insult to Sean Hannity.  Steve’s performance in this thread has been a tour de force of boomercon-libertarian retardation.
“Tariffs bad!”“White workers are drug addicts!”“Get a few side hustles in case you lose your job!”“Corporations only outsource because government regulations force them to!”
I’m half convinced it’s an ingenious parody.  David French is scarcely this shameless.

            Not taking sides here, but what is 75% over 5 years?  First, the general agreement from economists I’ve followed is that since Biden got in office, we’ve had a 20% increase in inflation.  So immediately, I’m thinking they are asking for an increase (over depreciated base) of 55% over 5 years.  Second, inflation is not yet solved and there is reason to think we’ll get hit with another bout after elections.  Certainly, the government has not even approached addressing our deficit spending.  If we hit 9% levels for 5 years, that’s about break even salary-wise.  Also to note, one always asks for more than they are willing to accept.  Finally, the UAW got 25% over four years—but with COLA provisions.  Not sure what the entire demands are, but I’d go lower with a COLA included.
