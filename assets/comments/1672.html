        Sentenced to a life of endless interaction with 4 year olds who stomp their feet and slam their doors. Almost like they never grew up….

        I am currently reading a book by a woman who was an ardent socialist from Great Britain in the 1920’s.  She moved to Russia with her socialist husband to be part of the “great movement of the future”.  Things did not work out so well for her.I think much of the vehemence of the liberals of today is due to the reality that their dreams of the socialist, egalitarian society are proving to be nightmares.  Instead of admitting they were wrong or misguided, they resort to blaming the “wreckers” like the Tea Party, the Koch brothers, or some other convenient scapegoat.  To them, their socialist dreams would have been realized if not for the reactionaries who threw a monkey wrench in their plans.

        It’s become quite disturbing that in America, one can no more discuss policy with a “progressive” than one can discuss religion with a zealot.
