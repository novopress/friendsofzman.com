        This obviously extends beyond race, to things like gender (or lack thereof), and ideology. There are facts that sane, normal people observe to be self-evident but dare not speak in public. (Actually, a web search for the word “mokita” is what originally led me to your site.) I think the $1.95 college word for the phenomenon is Pluralistic Ignorance, where a majority of people hold (or reject) a certain belief, but keep their opinions secret because they fear that they’re in the minority. Nobody wants to be the brave idiot who stands up first.This is why complete control of media and information is crucial to authoritarian regimes, and why the massive clampdown on internet hate-think is occurring – and even tiny flare-ups of dissent must be ruthlessly stamped out. Can’t have people sharing non-approved opinions, because they may suddenly realize that they’re not in the minority any more. The whole scam depends on regular folks thinking that they’re the only sane person in the room.

            I don’t follow a lot of blogs but I do check in on a ew of them fairly regularly.  I continually see a similar phenomenon in a somewhat different field, that of  Armed insurrection.On any given day dozens of people will claim  to be “ready” to go to war against the government, the antifa, CNN or any of a myriad of other boogy-man organizations.  Yet no one seems able to get enough time off from their jobs to enable them to actually do anything.I’m not sure that’s a bad thing, you understand – if every guy with a SKS also took the initiative to reduce the population of liberal politicians in his town, county, state or whatever, the end result would look like the “Dorner” fiasco on steroids and there’s no telling how many newspapers would go undelivered.

        “A guy like Cowen is not wealthy and he is largely dependent on the state for his livelihood, like most libertarians.”
I for one appreciate the deliciousness of this sentence.

        Whether it’s Obamacare or funding (and aggressive defense) of Planned Parenthood or generous social-welfare programs, or understood segregation in cities, and more college campuses trying to offer segregated housing (as a feature not a bug), etc. I think race realism is already upon us.The issue has never been whether people objectively understand what they see with their eyes.  It has always been, “OK, so exactly what should be done about it?”  The solution over the last 40-50 years has been to educate the people you can, and subsidize the rest.  Biological differences mean that the subsidies fall disproportionately, and that minorities are better off in states that have a higher percentage of white people, and lower percentages of minorities.There have been other alternatives, of course, which the eugenics crowd was big into 100 years ago.  I think that this particular slippery-slope outcome is what drives a lot of normal people to try and catch themselves before they take it too far.  Because it is human nature to take it too far.All of this inevitably leads to the kinds of language people use.  It is human nature to say one thing, while doing something else, in order to preserve status, protect people’s feelings, gain an advantage, etc.  And so, out of one side of society’s mouth we’re all one big happy panoply of multicultural goodness.  But, out of the other side of society’s mouth, we recognize and finance the reality of the situation.It’s a bit like that CBS producer who was fired this week for saying all those Vegas shooting victims were country music fans, therefore Trump voters, therefore not really deserving of any sympathy.  She didn’t say anything that 99.99% of CBS and other media types would disagree with.  They all agree with her.Her offense was saying it out loud.  And then, at the same time, there is the obvious slippery slope argument that follows, and which opens the door to mass shootings of suspected Trump voters wherever they congregate.  Once you open that door, rhetorically-speaking, there are going to be people who decide to take it too far.

        It would be a lot easier to keep up believing that the emperor is not naked if his ministers would stop calling all of us names and saying we are naked. All that does is call attention to the fact that we are clothed while we can see his junk jiggling all over the place.

            The sacred blacks have taught you to speak of your reproductive organs as junk.
Your Grandfather prolly referenced your reproductive organs as “The family jewels” and which puissant difference demonstrates the destruction of culture contributed to those good whites who ape the sacred black man.

        Denying sex differences, which they do now, is far crazier than denying statistical variations in the traits between races.  At least in the latter case people like Cowen can claim ignorance because they don’t ever interact with blacks etc outside looking at sitcoms and clapping at keynote speakers.  I guarantee none of these guys seriously referred to a “female penis” before they were instructed to.

        At some point, cognitive dissonance will reach the breaking point. The ability to publicly denounce government policy will either succeed or we will fall under the boot of an enforcement tyranny so powerful, free speech will simply disappear.

                Like in Mexico …“Foreigners Cannot Engage in Political ActivityThe Mexican Constitution states very clearly that “Foreigners shall not in any way involve themselves in the political matters of the country” This is emphatically interpreted to mean that foreigners do not have the right to vote, run for public office, or participate in any political event, rally or demonstration. Additionally, foreigners should stay away from all political activity including any kind of demonstration or protest even if you think it is seemingly [n]on-political. Engaging in these kinds of activities is a good way to be asked to leave the country.”fromhttps://www.bajabound.com/before/legal/rights.php

            Speech is a means to an end. As Orwell observed, it is not really your speech they care about, it is your thoughts. Thoughts that are not freely communicated wither and die, and nature abhors a vacuum. Stark is the realization that our ignorant grandparents were right more often than we are.

        I guess it’s like getting caught up in arguments about whether immigrants are a net drain or blacks commit more crime, it’s all a sideshow to the main idea that multiculturalism is bad news and racial groups have the right to associate with their own kind.

            But, pointing out that immigrants are a net drain or blacks commit more crime are facts that allow us to determine that multiculturalism is bad news. So, its not just a sideshow. It is anecdotal and statistical data that is necessary to determine the truth of the situation. Admittedly, your average yahoo won’t really understand this, but more intelligent people, with an understanding of biology and statistics, will. And besides, your average yahoo won’t really understand that multiculturalism is bad news and racial groups have the right to associated with their own kind because they have been programmed for so long and don’t have the mental firepower to acknowledge the truth.

            You always did have an ‘Arthur Dent’ like quality Derb.When we ask the question “what will they believe next”, the answer is that we’re dealing with a distribution so they’ll believe all of the available options in varying percentages.  I think the line falls at how they make decisions, which is to say ‘How they act” in life, not “What they say they believe.”  Action is the great revealer of what people truly think.In that respect I think most will come to accept Biological determinism.  It’s what they know to be true now if you look at how they behave.  The difference now is that most ‘normies’ don’t want that heresy to be common knowledge so they deny it with their public words.And I’m honestly much less concerned about ‘good whites’.  They’ll believe (or say they believe) whatever gets them furthest from public approbation.  They are followers, and will go where they’re told.  I’m much more concerned with those people who simply ‘cannot’ accept the truths of biology.  Dangerous psychosis and violence may be outcome for them.As much fun as it may seem to think of the Huffington Post editorial staff being ‘triggered’ by reality, remember, among the Americans who will have every incentive to continue to deny biology in spite of ALL evidence is the 6% of our population that is already the most violent and aggressive.  Even if we restrict that to individuals with below average IQ’s, we’re still talking about Millions of individuals.  How do we find a way to reconcile them to the ‘facts’ when the facts quite literally tell them that they can probably never achieve as well as someone else picked at random?If you were the guy with the 85 IQ, how would you feel if you were told that it’s in your genes, and is therefore totally inescapable for you (and likely to be inescapable for any of your children to some degree as well)?It’s a real quandary.

Tell the 85 IQ people you can go to Cal Tech and become an electrical engineer if you just try hard enough? That seems even more cruel than just letting them know that they’re not cut out for college.Other countries that aren’t “diverse” don’t seem to have all this angst about tracking people into with below average intelligence into occupations they can handle. In Japan, if you’re not smart they track you into a vocational school and you become a construction worker or a truck driver or whatever. No one gets all weepy because some 85 IQ guy didn’t get to go to college.

                    Sure.  Totally agreed.  But we’re not a homogenous society.  6% (or so) of our population isn’t just low IQ, they’re also on average more aggressive, have lower self restraint, and   at some levels are more prone to criminality and violence than average. (I’m speaking males only here… I don’t even want to think about the women.)  That’s a tough group to sell the idea to.  Especially in an environment where any job which has a low requirement for cognitive ability is likely to be greatly automated.My main point is that I don’t think we can expect them to be happy about it, and I don’t know if I blame them exactly.  I think they will resist the idea to a much greater degree than anyone else.  It’s a tough world of course, and we all deal with our limitations.  But my appreciation of the cultural context of this issue is that it’s going to be a very difficult conversation to have with them.  It’s tragic really.

                        Dunning-Kruger probably kicks in, not to mention all the self-esteem classes in school. Plus the Kardashian once black never go back rap bullshit.In a sane society, they would learn a trade and be proud of their skills like some of the rather dull but skilledMexicans here in SD.

                    Jerry;Exactly.  That’s the sort of thing I was talking about above.  What we should be saying is, “Given what we know about HBD, how should we reorder our institutions so that those with lower IQ’s can have as fulfilling a life as is reasonably possible without ruining it for everybody else.  I’d say we ought to start with jobs.There are a number of ways.  For example, we should look at changing the minimum wage laws.  Anybody who doesn’t think that a high minimum wage doesn’t drive down low-skilled employment is wearing ideological blinders.  We’re running this unfortunate right now in bi-coastal blue land.

                        This comment string between Tom, Jerry and Al has been very insightful and highlights the problem exactly.  If all blacks in the US were magically made to look white, but kept their lower IQs and all other characteristics intact, the problem would go away.  They would accept their lot in life, become productive blue collar or retail workers, or at least would would not blame others for their failures.I am a relatively intelligent CPA, but have accepted that I will never have the genius or creativity to create great wealth, and have been happy making a good living off those who do.  I appreciate them for creating businesses where I can work, rather than ascribing their success to some unfair genetic advantage.But in effect having to wear a low IQ stamp on your forehead would leave anyone shameful, angry, and left searching for excuses.

The new bukharin classes almost immediately became infamous for broken families, crime, violence, prostitution, and drunkenness.

                Tom;Twin studies long ago disproved the idea of genetic/biological determinism.  In those studies, identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) who were reared apart shared about 50% in social and personality characteristics.  That’s a lot, but it’s way less than the nearly 100% one would expect if there were such a thing as genetic determinism.It is usually not pointed out, but these studies also refute blank-slateism because ~50% of our personality traits, etc. *are* strongly influenced by our genetics.  IOW, it is always possible to up your game, but effort alone will not make you into a world class ____ (take your choice).

                        Gotta say, though, the African blacks- even Somalis, to my surprise- are plumb terrified of American blacks.
Often their ancestors were the criminals that Africans couldn’t handle- so when given the chance, they sold them off to the Porteguese.

The guys on the football team couldn’t care less about the chess club, because most of them are getting laid and basking in the adulation of the rest of the school.

        I think that the underlying problem is spiritual.  The cultish suppression of what is right in front of our eyes is necessary *if* one is a self-interested secular materialist wedded to the anti-Christian dogmas of strict human egalitarianism, blank-slateism and human perfectibility through social engineering.  Otherwise, the obvious and disorienting spiritual implication is that your non-religion is false in some interminable (not to mention unflattering) way.And the implication for society is that those institutions that are optimized for the Cloud non-religion are going to fail in some indeterminable way as well.  This has to be a frightening thought better kept suppressed.Now, every elite tailors the social institutions it can influence to its own advantage.  And every elite is self-servingly wont to tell the underlings that their inferior condition is their own fault, the Brahmins  in India being the most pernicious example*.  So. it is to the historical credit of our own elite that they suppressed the doctrine that the previously servile conditions of American Blacks were their own fault.But it is most certainly *not*  to the Cloud’s credit that they created a society in which the majority of American Blacks cannot succeed while never-the-less carelessly pretending that they can, all the while enriching their fellow elitists and their mid-witted progeny.  The Chicago school system is a good example of this situation.I am not intellectually vain enough to pretend to know what a better system might look like entirely, but there is simply no excuse for not trying the older things that were known to help.  In the case of the Chicago school system, restoring order in majority-minority classrooms ought to be such a help.*In effect, ‘You are an untouchable because of your moral failings in your prior lives.’

        What exactly was the purpose of Cowen’s post? He was better off acting like Steve  doesn’t exist. He didn’t really state anything beyond “racism is bad mmmk” and provided nothing as far as data or evidence. In fact, it looks like an subtle argument from the consquences, a similar act that prof mcwhorter does, that the consquences are so abhorrent that we must ignore and hide the real data. That is childish and reflects how fragile their worldview really is.We have known for a long time the distributions are different and the distributions have material consquences. Of course, I don’t see how it encourages “racism”, as population level distributions and individuals are not equivalents. For example, the crime and I data would give me good reason to never live in a black neighborhood. But it doesn’t necessarily give me a good hereistic on a AA coworker. But I guess they feel the stupid dirt people are incapable of processing this without reverting to being Nazis.

        you didn’t mention the other races who are involved in this dance macabre between whites and blacks.   mexicans prefer not to have any blacks around them so are pushing the blacks back into the south.  the black community is going to wither and shrink over time as it is ignored more and more.  once the dem party goes full negro, the blacks will be totally ignored politically.

            I’ve called the two the Brown Party and the White Party for over twenty years, and every nonwhite ‘gets’ it immediately.They agree with ‘racism’ when I say, “Look, when somebody shames your ‘skin’, you can come down on your own four times harder than I can.Racism is natural, and good, you’re supposed to love and defend your own.We both feel most comfortable with our own; we both are proud of our best, and yet think ours are the biggest knucklheads too.We don’t let idiots bring shame to our skin.That’s what “honor your parents” means- not to obey wrong, but to live in such a way it brings honor to your parents, your family, your line, your people, your skin.”Only whites start out with “No… but…”The others, they all get it and pretty much agree.I am racist- not malevolent.I tell anyone that, and then see momentary surprise and then pleased relaxation when they realize I’m not going to blurt “I’m not a racist, really!” or lie, or grovel.This is called recognition and respect.  I see you for who you are.  Every face carries 10,000 years of history.A little mutual recognition goes a long way.Every day I meet nonwhites (and whites) who are fine people, good at their job, fun to talk to.We gotta get along.  Ain’t nobody going nowhere.  How to square this circle?

        The race thing is just one of the elements used to keep people in the mainstream cult.  The cult has stripped many people of any independent thought, and the rest, the doubters, are shamed out of any outward expression of what they are actually thinking.Progress is being made, because when people pretend to drink the Kool-Aid (Jim Jones reference intended), but don’t actually do so, then it is the beginning of the end for the cult.Cults depend on keeping their members in the dark and intimidated.  The work of getting alternative ways of thinking is so important.  I tend to think the deprogramming starts slowly, and then turns into an avalanche.  The Trump election and the NFL meltdown are two big positive tells, at this point.

            Taking it further, the mainstream cult is deep into shit-testing now.  The first real shit-tests were racial equality, gender equality, and gay acceptance.  Once these became too universally accepted, they had to move to more extreme tests.  Gender fluidity, intersectionality, white privilege, hands up-don’t shoot, punch a fascist, men in dresses in little girl restrooms.
It is interesting to me that the shit-tests are now so many and so extreme.  A cult that gets nervous turns up the shit-testing.  Unfortunately, a cult that is failing often goes suicidal and homicidal.  Plan accordingly.

                It seems more like the dancing mania of the middle ages, or the widespread cases of demonic possession of whole convents of nuns. Some type of disassociation apparently takes place according to rules or beliefs already established by an authority figure, especially in confined social environments (hmm.. sounds a lot like twitter/facebook).One description that seems particularly apt: “Theologians, inquisitors and exorcists established the rules of mass demonic possession to which dissociating nuns then unconsciously conformed: writhing, foaming, convulsing, dancing, laughing, speaking in tongues and making obscene gestures and propositions. These were shocking but entirely stereotypical performances based on deep-seated beliefs about Satan’s depravity drawn from religious writings and from accounts of previous possessions.”Replace the authority figures above with MSM, academia and politicians and it it appears that we are seeing a similar breakout. The bad news is that these lasted around 300 years until the established narratives were weakened enough to cease be enough of a trigger.

                Adding to my previous post and so neatly in line with the overall tone of the article I could not refrain from posting it. I came across this gem:http://nautil.us/blog/why-does-mass-hysteria-affect-mostly-women“Robert Bartholomew, a sociologist in New Zealand who has collected data on 800 outbreaks dating back to 1566, says that in 99 percent of mass hysteria events, the majority of its sufferers are female.But does that mean that there is something particular to the female physiology that predisposes them to hysteria? Not necessarily.”The more the article goes on the stronger the fear of disbelief becomes, ending with the usual idiotic position that such fear forces people to adopt:“Elaine Showalter, a medical historian at Princeton University, agrees, arguing that these physical symptoms are a kind of protest of patriarchal oppression”Hysterical.

        I had this very conversation yesterday with a man of otherwise solid intellect and reasonable moral fibre. We got into a minor tiff when I brought up race realism in the rejection of SJW doctrine – and he went into full virtue-signal mode.“IQ science is quack science, right up there with warble gloaming…” he said. So what will we believe in next? I think the answer is – it certainly won’t be science. It’s too bloody inconvenient for everyone to be useable.

            I’ve heard that the application of statistics to social and behavioral sciences is founded on work first done with IQ (by Galton, I think). Supposedly, no result in the social sciences is more established than IQ, and its measurement. Indeed, Jordan Peterson asserts that if IQ is meaningless, then so is everything else in the social sciences. Or something similar to that.
Of course, given the irrepeatability of a signifcant percentage of social science results, maybe it IS all bullshit.

        Since public opinion is a pendulum, “what they’ll believe in next” is probably what lots of folks on our side of the internet already seem to believe — that biology is ALL there is.  Ever notice how the ends of centuries are the same?  They were saying all this back then, too — Degenerate Art, Social Darwinism, fitter family contests, etc.  And while I for one couldn’t be happier if we replaced Judith Butler with William Graham Sumner on Intro to Studies reading lists, it’s the same category error.

            Beliefs, even stupid ones, persist because they are useful. Every society has pretty lies that help grease the wheels. In 80% white America, pretending blacks *could* be equal to whites was mostly harmless and allowed for riot prevention polices like welfare, public housing and affirmative action. In a majority-minority society, whites cannot afford to finance the lifestyle of the non-whites, so the underlying belief will go way.
So much of what is going on is a carry over from the old era. But, people cling to the old stuff until there is new better stuff.

                Yep.  In this case, though, there’s plenty of even-older stuff that works just fine to rebut the old stuff.  You could take the writings of any 1920s Progressive — Margaret Sanger, say — modernize the style a bit, and have a perfect “Alt-Right” (or whatever) manifesto about how we should sterilize the defective races.  I’m betting that is what in fact WILL happen, as the pendulum swings back further and harder “right.”  (After all, the “Progressives” of the 20s only abandoned all that “race hygiene” stuff because Uncle Joe Stalin told them to, because it was useful in his fight with Silly Mustache Guy).

        “Another thing I found interesting, amusing actually, was that Cowen succumbed to the claim that there is greater genetic diversity within racial groups than between them.”
I’m pretty sure this argument originally came from Steve Sailer.  The above is like observing that there is greater variation in batting average within baseball teams than there is between them, and then concluding that team batting average makes no difference when it comes to winning and losing baseball games.
It is really just remarkably stupid.  So much so that it’s a feat of intellectual prowess to be able to believe it.

        I still don’t know how one separates out culture in assessing innate intelligence; I think it’s impossible.Imagine , if you will,  an honest-to-goodness genius Aborigine from the Australian outback – born, raised and still living in that sort of primitive culture; what test is there to assess his/her intelligence?An IQ test – requiring pencil and paper and necessarily some sort of reading comprehension – that somehow eliminates educational achievement?Really.If you cannot read or have never seen “three” dimensional figures printed on two dimensional paper (and asked to rotate a figure 90 degrees) or if you literally cannot even understand what is being asked, how is one expected to answer the question?That genius Aborigine would test out as a moron with an IQ of 5.All those IQ /test results that show 9th grade white jewish kids have equal reading comp/IQ as black college grads – ON AVERAGE  – do not account for the fact that racist college admissions policies have allowed unqualified black (and hispanic) kids to attend colleges to which they never should have been admitted and more importantly, the MAJORITY of black college students major in total bullshit subjects; e.g., sociology, psych., political science, Black studies , elementary education., etc.These college majors require little to zero thinking, develop zero analytical skills and require the student to just regurgitate the lefty garbage shoved down their throats. No real need to have any reading comprehension skills because these majors don’t require anyone to have any.And, oh yes, they WILL receive passing grades in all their coursework – regardless of their level of literacy  and writing ability because, well, … you know.And they will “earn” (i.e., be given to them) a college degree.So, if an IQ AVERAGE is calculated from a sample space of poorly prepared and poorly educated students – regardless of the academic degree they “earn,” (BA, BS, PhD)  – you will get the results that show racial disparities in intelligence.I was a tutor at a NYC public college years ago; I tutored math to “open admissions” students.  These students were admitted based only upon the fact they had a HS degree from a NYC HS.Yea, most were black and hispanic.These kids were totally lost academically. They literally knew ZERO; not even 6th grade math. For all intents and purposes, they had ZERO education for the first 17 years of their life despite their HS diplomas (a worthless piece of toilet paper containing fancy script).Many did not graduate college, but many did.And if you tested the IQ / educational achievement of these grads, well, they would have fared poorly.I’ve read that if a child is never exposed to language (and speaking)  by the age of 10 or so, it is impossible for that individual to ever learn  to speak.I will submit that if a person has for all intents and purposes not been educated in any real way for the first 17 years of life (despite getting a HS diploma)  and because of their (pathological) culture they are not exposed at home to reading or learning of any sort, well, ON AVERAGE, they will IQ/ reading comprehension  test poorly.And if accepted to university (based on race), major in totally undemanding subject material and pushed through college right through the PhD level, one should expect their IQ / reading comp. scores, comparatively speaking,  to be poor.And they are.My point is these students – ON AVERAGE – may not be born “dumber.”They literally become dumb – ON AVERAGE – as they get older (as compared to other groups) , and the intelligence test results reflect, ON AVERAGE, the pathological (self inflicted, anti-learning) cultural traits of certain ethnic/racial groups.The level of educational achievement means little if no real learning is required. And constructing achievement/IQ averages from, literally,  below par sample spaces will necessarily produce sub par AVERAGE results.

                For an adult to discover a truth it is first nearly always necessary for him to change his mind. That is why it takes so long to do so unless you have acquired the habit. It is just as the Derb said, life is a series of one bubble popping after another.

                Exactly so.  Asking someone to repeat five numbers forward and then backwards merely requires the ability to count to ten.  Maybe the isolated Aborigine cannot, but 100% of black US citizens can do this before preschool.

            ” the MAJORITY of black college students major in total bullshit subjects; e.g., sociology, psych., political science, Black studies , elementary education., etc. ”
People with significantly above average iQs find these subject boring.  What’s more, even people with average IQs know that their chances of earning high incomes are better in more challenging majors like engineering and computer science. They’re more likely to at least attempt those courses – and if they’ve any intelligence they’ll quickly find that they have some talent for them.
As you noted, that phenomenon doesn’t seem to exhibit much for black students.

        “While it is true that there is greater variation between individuals, than between groups of individuals, it does not invalidate classifying individuals into different racial groups. Traits common to one group, even in great variety, may not exist in another. Cowen was falling for what is informally known as Lewontin’s Fallacy.”I have been trying for years to get some one to tell me what they mean when they say there is greater variation between individuals (usually termed as greater variation within groups than across groups) than between groups of individuals. I’ve never gotten an answer back because this phrase has no basis in truth. Wouldn’t there have to be specific number of traits for individuals and groups that could be quantified? And how has that been done? It sounds even more ridiculous when it is phrased “There is more genetic variation within groups than between groups”. If that’s true, you would have to know the entire genome and what each allele in sequence does. And how would you quantify that? By counting differences in individual DNA AND group DNA? None of this has ever been done, so saying such a thing is really used to imply that negroes are more similar to Whites than Whites are to each other???!!! Ridiculous, of course.If it means that there are more types of traits in individuals than in groups, how and where has this been quantified? It seems to me that groups could have as many traits as individuals, you would just have to define the traits and what each means. But, even if it was determined that there are more individual traits than group traits, it would mean that the group traits would actually have far greater impact than individual ones. Personally, I think it was originally floated as some specious rationale for claiming that racial group differences are insignificant compared to the difference between you and your brothers. And most people know that this is just not true.

            Think of it this way. A baseball team has 24 players each with a different batting average. The worst hitter is below .200 while the best hitter is over .300. Relative to hitting, that a lot of variation. There are 30 baseball teams and the worst team is at .235 and the best team at .280. That is, less variation between teams than between the players on each team.
No one thinks teams don’t exist.

                Oh, I understand that. Now, how does this relate to comparing genomes? Isn’t that like comparing apples to oranges? Baseball has certain rules, biology has certain rules. And never the twain shall meet. What if you compare hair color or hair texture? There is more variety among Whites as compared to other races. So, this is a possibility. But, it is irrelevant comparing 4 or more hair types in one group to only one in another. And there are those that would argue that these hair colors appear in the other races, too. Just at a much, much lower frequency. Mutant level of frequency. What I think you’re trying to say is that there is statistical variance in ALL things. The curve may be extremely narrow or broad, but there are still 1, 2, 3, even 4 Standard Deviations. Again, how is that relevant enough to make this “hypothesis” last for decades and not have anyone that actually has any data to base DNA evidence on? I’m really curious. Where were the original and subsequent studies?

        I’m not sure why you’re beating this drum so vigorously. Yes, the differences between races is both real and consequential. Yes, there will always be people that deny this reality. No, you will not “enlighten” or change their thinking processes with a few internet articles. The fixation that this problem will go away with more talking is naive.

                Sorry for the misunderstanding of my comment. I am not asserting that any war has begun. Nor am I advocating for that.

Rather, it’s an appealing distraction because it’s an easy alternative when compared to the path of hard knocks, which is how real behavioral change occurs. We don’t need more easy, we need more hard.

        Being a racist would be much easier without people like Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas, Ben Carson, etc., but IQ misses the point for me. High IQ sociopaths abound, as do low IQ Moral folks.  The problem with the inner-city blacks is their behavior, sociopaths, along with most of the people on the African continent, it seems.  IQ ? Culture? Oddly enough, sociopathology seems to be working for them.  Witness the projected population chart for the African continent mentioned a few blogs ago.

            Never having been to Africa but having relatives there, the feedback I get is that many, if not most of the people there just want to get along in life, much like here.  But they do live in a low-IQ society, and the amoral higher-IQ types, combining intellectual advantages with ambition and ruthlessness, tend to seize the tools of government and economic power for themselves and their cronies, leaving the rest of them to their own meager devices.  The result is what we see in the news stories from there.  It appears many of the young male emigrants to the West share that ambition and ruthlessness.People visiting or legally emigrating from there are often astonished at the attitudes of American blacks.  They have trouble understanding why people given such a country to live in, with all the good things it offers, would be so angry.  Later, as they marinate in the racial stuff here, they adopt a sort-of two sided attitude.  The adopt a bit of the angry attitude along with the warmth and sociiability they brought with them.  This is, in part, so the American blacks are less likely to treat them as rubes.The population boom is a combination of relative poverty and the lack of an economic safety net that encourages large families to support the young and elderly, along with the introduction of a fair amount of western medicine and living habits that extend life expectancy.  This combination has not been seen on a large scale before, so it will be “interesting” to see how it plays out over time.

                The more intelligent do not seize power in Africa. In low IQ societies what substitutes for intelligence is cleverness. Low IQ plus cleverness grows brutality. Think Idi Amin and others. Brutality may not be the rule in African life, but it rules over it. Higher IQ Africans, in general, are by comparison lacking in brutality even as higher intelligence offers greater opportunities for brutality, which explains some Caucasians.

                Empathy is impossible to cultivate in numerous ethnic groups. There is no there there.
