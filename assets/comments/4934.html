        “In 2014 George Georges, a Syrian businessman, became the first of Antigua’s new citizens under the investment scheme.”Um…maybe the “official” scheme.EC 65,000, later “mistaken” for USD 65,000, would get one a passport well over a decade ago.“Checking in” for a stay at a very comfortable rehab (be sure to go through aisle 6 at customs!) got one an automatic “temporary citizenship”, with ZERO “vetting”.SEE: Yachties (well, and “others” seeking asylum from prosecution [tax/drug] in their home countries)

        This is something I have said for a long time, though my version is that the elite always have a ‘get out clause,’ or rather, airline tickets to elsewhere.If the going gets rough in the place they have laid down the laws to implement their policies, they can bugger off elsewhere at a great rate of knots. You and I haven’t that choice: we can’t go because we don’t have foreign bank accounts and ‘resources’ elsewhere to sustain us. We haven’t set up an escape route in readiness for mayhem, so we have to endure it locally.When Britain elected Tony Blair as PM in ’97 behind his ‘cool Britannia’ look and boyish grin, he was able to begin to plan for a future that wouldn’t rely on what was happening on the streets of the land that voted him in to power. Any disastrous policy initiated by his government would merely accelerate his departure to islands new (and sunnier). His political mates and himself wouldn’t even have to live near the collapsing society they orchestrated: when Labour decided to throw open the gates of Britain to tens, probably hundreds, of thousands of immigrants with questionable attitudes and unimpressive skills, those newbies wouldn’t be grubbing around near the elite’s comfortable homes. But, happily for them and their fellow wealthy socialists, if things got out of control they would go off somewhere else and leave the mess they created far behind.The Blairs and their successors then would be fully part of a global cloud, jetting here and there and living graciously cheek by jowl with others of a like mind, sipping cocktails on a balcony where they couldn’t see the smudge of burning nations on the horizon.
