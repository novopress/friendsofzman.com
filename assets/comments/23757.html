        Z, regarding your Taki piece, you need to separate the ruling class from the managerial class. The managerial class really does believe on some level the insane dictates given them (life is easier that way) but the true elite is very astute. They isolate themselves from the consequences of their dictates and clearly don‚Äôt believe them. Cases in point, all the pictures of them without masks and their buying ocean front property when they tell us the seas are going to rise.You mention the razor wire at the Capitol. That was a huge win for the ruling class. They have a large percentage of the population convinced there are hordes of white supremacists hiding behind every bush. To combat that the ruling class has given the managerial class the green light to crush any dissent they find a threat to their position. If that means sending BLM into white suburbs then those suburbanites better not fight back or it is Berlin 1933.And most people don‚Äôt pay enough attention to what is going on to even care. Case in point Liz Cheney. You are right in your assessment of her but why then was she elected? Simple. The money was behind her and she had name recognition. That name recognition should have led to her defeat but that would require people thinking through the issues and that is boring

            If these selection pressures exist long enough and are widespread enough, then eventually you have a world of too many vampires and too few victims. Those vampires have to feed, so they will move onto other victims. That may be where we are now in the late stages of empire. Everywhere you look the remaining bits of the original spirit are covered with vampires, looking for a clear bit of neck into which they can sink their fangs and suck some blood. Ours is a vampire economy now.The Venn Diagram of the intersection between the set of all Vampires and the set of all Passive Aggressives will be just about a perfect 1-to-1 fit.Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder is the meta-sociological cancer which necessarily originates and evolves and metastasizes in order to destroy end stage civilizations.The four things you have to study in order to understand the moderin world are:1) The race question [to include the JQ],2) The Insula-dominant/Amygdala-submissive neuropsychiatric wiring of the White shitlib,3) Women ‚Äì you can either love them, or know them, but not both, and4) The omnipotent power of Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder to destroy everything in its path.PS: Apparently ‚ÄúChad Gangsta Alpha PUA‚Äù Bill Gates was hosting nekkid pool parties [with hired strippers] since forever. So it‚Äôs looking moar &amp; moar likely that he‚Äôll have a significant M0ssad/Epstein/Maxwell problem on his hands.And boy oh boy oh boy would the Vampires of the Frankfurt School just love to destroy an uppity goy like Bill Gates.[Back in the day, Gates &amp; Allen ackshually did some pretty amazing coding ‚Äì on that first big contract they won, they were flying by the seat of their pants, and it‚Äôs a minor miracle that they pulled it off.]

            If the goal is to educate and persuade enough folks to make any actual difference, then we need to work a littler harder on the messaging. Just copying the snarky, shallow techniques of the leftist Twitter mob isn‚Äôt going to work, and they own that battle space anyway. People who are sick of that drivel come to sites like this one looking for something better.

        You touched on the ‚Äúcreative destructtion‚Äù aspect of the boom/bust cycle, but you did not elaborate that this is a critically needed, albeit unpopular aspect of an economic cycle. In the ‚Äúold days‚Äù, a recession/depression did create a lot of bankruptcies, threw people out of work and so on. The boom was traditionally caused by loose credit/easy money, the bust by a tightening or a simple realization by the market that the debts were of dubious creditworthiness, or other crisis of confidence. Tough times weeded out weak producers, removed bad debts through bankruptcy or default, etc. It was, if you like, the economy‚Äôs equivalent of a prairie or forest fire: it is part of the cycle of nature, to get rid of old dead wood and underbrush. For some species, a fire is essential to its life cycle.  In many parts of America, the control of smaller brush fires is precisely the wrong thing to do: it allows brush to build up and eventually a major conflagration occurs. Oops. In a similar way, the government juices the economy along, trying to keep the buzz going for as long as possible. Clearly, there must be limits to how far this can go on. The really amazing thing is how long the system has been able to withstand the abuse. Beyond currency depreciation, we also have the zombie companies an dyes, vampires who suck the life out of once-productive businesses. The easy credit papers over all sorts of rot, excuses behavior that would have been foolish or even illegal in a more honest economy, etc. End it will, but when or how is anyone‚Äôs guess.

            These repeating ‚Äúpump-and-dump‚Äù events are designed to transfer  wealth and control into fewer hands. The growth that occurs after the brushfire, to use your analogy, is more like a corporate tree farm replacing native forest after a controlled burn. For example, see the comments on Dollar General vs. locally owned mom ‚Äòn pop stores below.

        I was discussing something similar with my friends last night.  The total lack of craftsmanship in nearly everything we consume these days.  From entertainment to durable goods.   Even 20 years ago you used to pay a premium for a product, and get something that‚Äôs slightly better made.  You get what you pay for.  Now we‚Äôre NOT getting what we pay for.  Just interchangeable nameplates on the same with the same underlying cheap components.  The cheapness is everywhere.  And ugliness.   An era completely devoid of all pride and taste.

            On the other hand, for people streaming across the border illegally, all this cheap stuff seems like paradise.  They don‚Äôt seem to realize they are the human equivalent.  Once it dawns on them that they are being allowed to debase our citizenry for the very same reasons that an American working man‚Äôs labor was also debased, they are probably going to feel pretty ripped off, which seems to be the modus operandi of the globalists.  No one comes away from an encounter with globohomo feeling like they got a good deal in the end.  All that matters is that we keep shopping.  If we aren‚Äôt up to the task, they will just import some new shoppers.

                It will never ‚Äúdawn on them‚Äù. That‚Äôs just cope. It‚Äôs like people saying ‚Äúwait till blacks find out they are on the democratic plantation!‚Äù They are low IQ Globohomo compliant slaves. As long as there are gibs, it‚Äôs infinitely better than living in Mexico (or India). Indians keep cramming into Canada in more and more degrading conditions despite the near zero upward mobility.
If they could ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù they would have figured it out back home and maybe made it less of a shit hole.

                    Very true.  They are ‚Äúessential workers‚Äù after all.It will never dawn on them that they are losers.  They won the lottery from their point of view I am sure.  It‚Äôs like one of those scary movies where ‚ÄúBeware‚Äù is written above a door that opens to a staircase that leads to a dank dark basement.  We are all sitting here saying ‚ÄúAmerica is finished‚Äù and yet, like the people in scary movies going down to see what‚Äôs in the basement, the illegals keep streaming in thinking they are getting the deal of the century.  The US government will turn on you and drive you into destitution for political reasons because it is a system designed to steal wealth from vulnerable for the benefit of ultra-wealthy.  Beware.And yet they keep on coming in.

            Today, there is no such thing as a product that solves a problem without creating a new one. We live in the world of offsets.

                    Taboo like being gay in 1990 was taboo.  One of those things everyone knows but it‚Äôs just not something they can talk about on the nightly news.  In most cities nobody cared.  It was one of those fictional bodice ripper topics that elderly women rural states watching tv found scandalous.  If anything, the last 10 years has shown us that that lady‚Äôs moral compass counts for nothing.  Everyone knows Jews control the media and everything is being oriented around a war with Iran on Israel‚Äôs behalf.

        A New Tomorrow (cont)Why antibodies matter.Once upon a time in the history of the evolution of our species, the natural environment of our ancestral era provided the primary mechanism of culling dysfunctional members from each tribe. This culling was most often driven by the forces of natural fitness selection, in that those individuals who were not well suited to survive &amp; thrive in the local environment typically died young thereby failing to pass on their genes via reproduction. And we grew smarter &amp; stronger with each passing generation spanning back in time at least 100,000 years. Then civilization happened and everything changed. Natural culling is now extinct. And it is the pathogens (read vampires/parasites) who now grow stronger with each passing generation. In a healthy organism, it is the antibodies that must cull these pathogens when nature cannot.

            It depends on how you look at it, Tom.  In one sense, everything is natural. Everything is made of atoms. Nothing that isn‚Äôt atomic exists.
Pathological altruism is not unnatural, being just another way for a life form to behave. If a behavior becomes too maladaptive, it will die out. Evolution is blind and unforgiving. A species or subspecies that fails to adapt or change its behavior in a new environment may be replaced or go extinct, as in what we see is happening to white people.

                Homo sapiens in the modern era are different from every other life form that preceded us. We modify our environment more than extensively and faster than anything save an asteroid strike. And our ability to use artificial selection to quickly alter the natural environment (as an example, modern cereal grains and domesticated animals) has produced a huge boon in food supply. As has modern medicine which has substantially eliminated our heritage robustness via the extinction of natural mortality.But to your point, yes, colony collapse may be in the offing because our DNA-based disease resistance is persistently declining and there is likely to limit to artificial miracle cures.And none of this means that we should become defeatist and quit. Rather, I argue that we should evolve and fight back smarter. Yakking &amp; vote gullibility is counterproductive because it diffuses the anger that normally motivates people into action. And mass protest whining or mob violence also accomplish nothing other than venting &amp; destruction. There is better way, and it requires intelligence, seriousness, and focus.

Whites need to change their maladaptive behavior or die out. To stop feeling guilty and making excuses and feeling ashamed for their success.  Let pride, strength, and confidence replace weakness, doubt and shame or else we shall die out. Thus spoke Zarathustra.

                    You are probably going to need to recruit some younger people.  The geriatric keyboard warriors of the dissident right don‚Äôt seem to be connecting with anyone but other geezers.  The best way to recruit younger people, as the Left learned long ago, is to create non-profit jobs that match your ideology and then hire absolute fanatics for those jobs out of college.  An example from the Left would be:  we want to distribute condoms in gay bars.  OK, so now you form a non-profit that gets huge numbers of condoms from various grants, donations, corporate gifts and then you go around to gay bars and hand out those free condoms.  Everyone wins.  People will do that kind of job for like $12/hr because they are fanatical believers in the cause of gay rights.Right wing causes have absolutely nothing on par with that kind of activism/employment.  The Left has built up an army of millions of people in major cities who either work for their non-profits or work for government agencies that distribute funds to their non-profits.  Arts.  Social Services.  Activism. Social causes.  On and on.  And now that almost every Billionaire in America is a socialist/leftist/trans rights/BLM activist, they have loads of money to shovel at their friends.  And they probably get a tax deduction for doing so.If there was some kind of organization that I could work for to promote our cause, I would gladly do so even at poverty wages if it meant being freed from having to put up with corporate/woke life in the big city.  But there isn‚Äôt.  All the right wing jobs in thinktanks and suchlike go to a very specific group of people who pick from among their friends at the top.  Like, if you were personal friends of the Bush family, you would probably have a job in Washington working for some goofy institute that puts out white papers on tax law for wealthy donors.  But you could only ever get that job if you knew someone who was powerful in the Republican party. The people at the top do absolutely nothing to help their voters or supporters if you are on the Right.  I probably got 1000 emails last year asking for Donations from the Republican party but i never once got anything saying there was a community based way to contribute to the cause at all.  They couldn‚Äôt care less about anything other than sucking money out of their supporters.  Unlike the Left, the Republicans provide nothing in return.  No community.  No activism.  No friendship or comraderie.  No activities.  Just:  send us more money so we can win back congress!  Why?  Am I supposed to have some deep philosophical commitment to helping a rich guy protect his assets from Socialist theft just because I don‚Äôt like trannies?  Puh-lease.  I hope the socialists do stick it to middle class white people and America withers and disappears.  I really couldn‚Äôt care less about ‚Äúfighting back‚Äù anymore.  You are on your own.  Once all of this is wiped away and we are in a position to start over I might join in but i suspect it‚Äôs just going to be more of the same:  send us money.

                        I hear you, but I also don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to be able to community organize our way out of the mess we‚Äôre in. There are too many illegals flooding in and at least half the population has now been seduced into parasitism, so trying to rally the sane is likely to be too little, too late.My prediction is that things are going to get real sooner rather than later, and we will have two potential paths going forward. One is the passive acquiescence path taken by the Russian people in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution, which then resulted in tens of millions dead at the hands of Soviet tyranny. The other path is the one taken by our forefathers in the American Revolution, which required active rebellion against a much bigger and more powerful State authority, so it was long odds but worth the gamble in my opinion.Conventional warfare is typically fought with young men, so I can understand your desire to begin recruiting them now. But the last time that was tried (American Civil War), it resulted in 600,000 dead alphas from both sides and 3 times that number grievously wounded, so not optimum.You don‚Äôt beat a Goliath with a set piece battle in which the other side is holding all the big firepower. Better is to fight from the shadows and focus on the root of the problem. And all ages can play because unconventional &amp; spontaneous is more impactful than macho bravado by young studs.

                        I think this bears highlighting ‚Ä¶ getting a good DC job requires connections, something the GOP elite aggressively promote, but also seek to hide from their base, perhaps to maintain the illusion of meritocracy. I almost stumbled into this trap. In my mid-30‚Äôs my now ex-wife was pissed about my navy career and suggested that I should get out and work in DC. She offered up the example of her friend from college who worked in some DC think-tank and her husband, who was a GOP staffer on the Ag committee. I mentioned this to my boss at the time, who had several Pentagon tours under his belt. He immediately saw the con and asked ‚Äúwho‚Äôs his dad?‚Äù (referring to the guy who works on the Ag committee) The answer turned out to be that his dad was the second larger farm owner in (midwest state, maybe Michigan?) and was active in GOP politics. By comparison, my dad was in the Navy and had no connections. In other words, what my silly ex-wife saw as merit was in fact nepotism.

                Star Trek is like the USSR writ galactic but will all of USSR‚Äôs problems (e.g. motivation) resolved or completely hidden. The Federation operates its gulag archipelago far away from Earth on a mulititude of worlds, all of them in remote parts of Federation space. The economic calculation problem has been solved, and as in the USSR, loyalists get the most exiting jobs and best resources.There are never any shortages. Want a snack or tea, Earl Grey, hot? Just tell the computer to make it with that magical materializer device. Religion is effectively smothered, and in it‚Äôs place is the holodeck where you can act out your every fantasy. Unlike the USSR, however, only a few people in the Federation have any money, and this is just for interaction with outsiders, like the Ferengi,  who are represented with grotesque caricatures.

                Check out this brief clip of Ted Turner asking oily Carl if he‚Äôs a socialist. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what a socialist is, but‚Ä¶but I believe that government has a responsibility to care for the people.‚Äù He disguises what he really believes with doubletalk about making people self-reliant. Funny that the Fascists of Italy and the Nat Socs of Germany held the same attitude about state parentalism.

Ms. Nut, you may be able to let poor people die in the street due to unfitness, I‚Äôm pretty sure I could, but most people can‚Äôt.
Most people want a social safety net from their government.  To impose ‚Äúlive and let die‚Äù libertarianism would ironically involve violating the non-aggression principle.

                        LITS, if most people want ‚Äúa social safety net‚Äù (i.e. a generous welfare state) from their government, then what they really want is to live as farm animals or as the farmer. This suggests that they don‚Äôt really deserve to live at all, but it‚Äôs the condition under which any European Fascist, Nat Soc, ‚ÄúProgressive‚Äù, democrat, or corporate capitalist wants people to live. It‚Äôs also the condition in which most people of European descent find theirselves. Our animal farm culture is degrading and crippling, and it‚Äôs a contributor to the slow-motion suicide which anyone can observe. But I think that you prefer it anyway. THAT is ironic.====================Ashli Elizabeth BabbittA Constitution nut killedby the empire she servedAged 35 yearsR.I.P.====================

                        Ms. Nut, I commend you on having perfectly consistent beliefs, like many right libertarians.
The problem is that so few people agree with you, and those that do are almost entirely high-IQ white men.  Non-whites hate your vision of self-sufficiency.  Your model may be logically consistent but it doesn‚Äôt apply to the world in which we live.
In my judgment, we‚Äôre going to need an army bigger than that just the right libertarians, so you must accept your need for white people whom you may deem insufficient.
Your skin is your uniform.

            Star Trek remained popular for decades until it went BLM, so ‚Äúendless remakes‚Äù had little to do with its decline. The current incarnation is a failure because the feminist writers, wholly unqualified for the job, have contempt for the audience: White males.The majority of Discovery‚Äôs leads are female POCs. There are no heterosexual White male protagonists who don‚Äôt appear in makeup. The leaders of every major world are female. They deliberately cast White men to be the bad guys (always defeated by the show‚Äôs POC lead). And they actively discriminated against White male directors when producing the show.Modern Star Trek has nothing to do with what the target audience of White men actually want ‚Äî exploration, philosophy, science fiction, and cool spaceships &amp; technology. Instead, it‚Äôs a bizarre concoction of feminist complaints, underhanded jokes about men, nihilism, and science fantasy (girls love magic, not so much technology). Modern Trek is written for an audience that doesn‚Äôt exist to the exclusion of the traditional audience. That‚Äôs why it failed.Star Trek was always a vehicle for smart White men to fantasize about doing cool things like explore the galaxy, being around hot girls, making peace with aliens, space battles, learning about science, and discussing philosophy with extraterrestrials. It‚Äôs sorta funny to read old boomers complain about ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù Star Trek when that show was far more tame, and much more White, than anything on television today. There are even moments of that show that could be considered subversive, like its ‚Äúequality‚Äù and ‚Äúmeritocracy‚Äù over ‚Äúequity‚Äù focus. There is even a scene in DS9 where the black captain is told to get over his racial grievances with 1960s America. Sure, there were ‚Äúwoke‚Äù moments like a couple of hot chicks about to kiss each other in DS9 (and typical muh racism, nonbinary stuff), but it was tolerable unlike the modern incarnation.99% of Star Trek was tame by modern standards. Far from being a socialist utopia, Star Fleet was a fiercely meritocratic paramilitary‚Äìscience division that enjoyed the fruits of technological progress, not Marxist economic theory. The leisure came from technology, not communism. That‚Äôs a point it‚Äôs detractors miss.

        The libertarian explanation of boom and bust cycles always seemed to make the most sense to me.  Whether it is the private banks of the 19th century or the fed of the 20th century, printing too much money causes an expansion which real production cannot keep up with. Money is poured into long term economic expansion which is not needed and will never be profitable like bridges to nowhere, canals that nobody needs or millions of new square feet of office or retail space for which there is no demand.

        Ah. So AINO is the Vampire Empire.As for film franchises, not all of them lapse into laughable and increasingly unprofitable self parody. Take for example, the James Bond franchise, which has been around for 59 years, and, the Kovid Kaptivity notwithstanding, is still going strong. Up until very recently the most profitable Bond film was Thunderball (1965), which was finally eclipsed by Skyfall (2012), which netted over a billion dollars. Of course, it now seems likely that James Bond, under the onslaught of the AWRs, will soon be converted to Afro-Bond, which, of course, is not James Bond at all. That demarche may well put paid to 007 as Ernst Stavro Blofeld never could.

                There were moments of self parody during the Moore years, but, with the possible exception of Moonraker, none of Moore‚Äôs films were entirely self parodic. And, say what you will about the Daniel Craig films, there‚Äôs very little self parody in them, and in terms of their seriousness‚Äìarguably too serious‚Äìthey hark back to Dr. No and From Russia with Love.  The only Bond film that made a true mockery of the Bond mythos was Die Another Day, which is unwatchable.

        I‚Äôve long maintained, living in Hollywood as it were, that the push for homosexuality acceptance was merely so Hollywood could insert gays into the roles of straights and make it seem as if they were creating new material when in fact it was the sitcom from the past with a new cast.   They could save lots of money, paper over the fact of a dearth of creative energy in the community and that Hollywood had become a spent force, and get brownie work points from the critics.  The icing in the cake was their own sexual degeneracy became more normalized.Race is playing the same role.  No need to invent a new franchise or new plot.   Just take the white guy and make him black, or gay, or a tranny.If anyone remembers the instant soup?   It works similarly,   Just  add water and voila.

            Not really about movies, but you have reminded me of watching  ‚ÄòA Christmas Carol‚Äô performed at Ford‚Äôs Theater several years ago. Half the actors and actresses were black; Scrooge himself was performed by a black. Otherwise the production was conventional. At the end of the show the entire cast formed a chain at the front of the stage and chanted some ‚Äúinspiring Christmas message‚Äù that, in retrospect, was some SJW prayer, exhortation, or whatever. It didn‚Äôt bother me at the time because I didn‚Äôt yet feel walled in by ‚Äòwokeness‚Äô, and I was happy to have seen something ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô at that historical venue. Now, I realize I was being mind-raped.

The last Oscars and Golden Globes (and Grammys) were the lowest rated ever but most diverse. Can you see the pattern there?They asked for it.

                This one never gets old:
‚ÄúJews totally run Hollywood‚Ä¶ The Jews are so dominant, I had to scour the trades to come up with six gentiles in high positions at entertainment companies. When I called them‚Ä¶five of them refused to talk to me, apparently out of fear of insulting Jews‚Ä¶ All eight major film studios are run by men who happen to be Jewish‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt care if Americans think we [Jews] are running the news media, Hollywood, Wall Street or the government. I just care that we get to keep running them.‚Äù  ‚Äî Joel Stein, LA Times, 2008-12-19

        I actually like the recent Alien prequels. The Engineers are interesting characters. Sort of a sci-fi treatment of gnostic themes.  Alien vs Predator is a different story.
‚ÄúIn a world where you make as much or more money from copying the ideas of others‚Ä¶‚Äù
Read that and first thing that came to mind was the Chicom Knockoff Century.  Fits the vampire motif for sure.

I thought the idea was good, anyway. Certainly as good as walking vaginas that stick their penises down their victim‚Äôs throat to lay eggs. Maybe not even as subversive.

                    The latest Mortal Kombat removed Johnny Cage, the White male character, because he was White and the producers didn‚Äôt want a White man saving the world. The only White male who appears in the film is a villain. The movie, predictably, crashed. But yet they make this stuff anyway. My guess: this is CIA backed propaganda. The studios certainly don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre in any danger going bankrupt making this unprofitable junk, so there has to be something going on. Either that or the executives figure they can put this woke stuff on their resumes and then skate and get a new job before the studio implodes.

                I have to admit I got sucked into tuning into the daily information firehose of the internet because of the pandemic.  I kept hoping there would be some relevant, new information. I watched hours and hours of news, new conferences, press briefings, analysis.  Almost every day.  And then I realized that, for example, Fox News will announce the daily news topics in the morning and then for the rest of the day every news show will simply repeat the exact same stories over and over all day long until about 10 pm when they just switch to broadcasting reruns of the days news.  It‚Äôs worse than the movie Groundhog day.  Every day is exactly the same and yet every day there is some earth shattering factoid that needs to be discussed ad nauseum in order to elevate the political narrative.  It‚Äôs purely dystopian information designed to demoralize and humiliate the public rather than to inform anyone of anything.  Seeing how the ‚Äúnews cycle‚Äù works so clearly over the last year really left me feeling dejected and lost.  Even the Republican party follows this same pattern of pretending to talk about current events but only ever really trying to create the narrative that dominates the news cycle.  They created a bleak echo chamber of meaningless words.I have completely lost faith in the idea of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù.  We are basically being openly threatened with genocidal annihilation by our own political elite and not a single news organization is willing to talk about it.  How is this not some kind of crime against humanity?  Tucker went out on a limb and essentially confirmed the ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù theory that was the core of the Charlottesville message but even then no one in the political elite of either party seems to care about the fact that what is happening here is a real violation of human rights and they are all clearly working to genetically change the population of the United States through open borders, violence, and intimidation.  And threatening to throw us all in jail or worse if we complain about.  Human Rights as a political topic is obviously pure hooey. Crimes against humanity only ever matter for one particular group of tribalists and no one else really gets any consideration.  So the concept is hollow.  Meaningless really.

        We have to recognize that enormous sectors of the economy ‚Äì government, health care and education ‚Äì are de facto State cartels. Therefore, they are impervious to innovation and productivity enhancement.
A great example during the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù was Zoom school teaching. In this case, technological innovation (Zoom) was, for the first time in US history, employed to make a product worse, as actual in-person education went ‚Äúon-line‚Äù.

            Zoom is the ideal offshoot of the drive for ‚Äútechnology in the classroom,‚Äù which has been an educational imperative since ca. 2010. And, outside of the catastrophic destruction of academic standards to make way for diversity, nothing is more deleterious to teaching and learning than technology in the classroom.
Are there any trends in the Western world that are not ominous and harmful?

                Nothing could be better to freeze technology than to put it in the classroom.  Had there been such a push for technology in the late 70s, we‚Äôd all be using basic.

        We talked last week about how most of the people getting rich right now have added absolutely no value to the economy.  One of my brother‚Äôs in-laws made $70k on Doge bitcoin a couple weeks ago.  He immediately cashed out and used his unearned winnings to buy consumer products manufactured abroad.  It kind of feels like I‚Äôm living inside of a video game where the rules are just based on arbitrary programming rather than value and logic.

        I noticed while traveling through some small midwestern towns this weekend that Dollar Generals and Dollar Tree stores are in about every small town now.Sucking the local money right to Wall Street.The locals don‚Äôt even have to drive 30 miles to the Wal Mart Super Center anymore.The local general store owner of the past whom financed the local softball team and sat on local community boards is now replaced by a Dollar General manager whose focus is being a vampire and sucking money out of small towns.It‚Äôs everywhere in the modern age.

            When taking road trips, I always drive along back highways and stop at little country restaurants. I‚Äôve had some great conversations, some great food, (and some very bad food/coffee, but variety is the spice of life lol). You even run into some white owned gas stations, which I make sure to fill up at as much as I can.In the city I try and buy local where possible too. It‚Äôs a shame that the townspeople often seem to prefer the chains over their own local stores. Most Indian/Filipino owned franchises are just money laundering schemes, send remittances back home, or drug trafficking rings.

            it‚Äôs the weirdest thing. Small towns used to have the intellectual capital to generate enough people to run small retail operations. Are they still around?
Similar thing with suburban dining. Everything in the suburbs is chains restaurants, as if nobody knows how to open a diner, let alone some cool and expensive place ‚Äì those are all in the gentrifying parts of the city.

                I took a road trip with my dad last month and he made very clear that we are not trying anything new.  He wanted no surprises.  So motel 6 and chain restaurants was all we experienced.  Most of this arose during the boomer‚Äôs generation.  It‚Äôs amazing how picky the boomers are.  They‚Äôre nowhere near as resilient as my grandparents‚Äô generation.

                Since I live on a a farm in the rural Midwest and also run a business, here are my observations:Most rural folks either run a trade business or work in small manufacturing. Some also work in logistics (in my particular neck of the woods, this means the bourbon distributor in Clermont). A lot of men are self employed or contractors, which suggests they have the brains to manage retail. As best I can tell, the reason they do services instead of retail is because of the margins. I‚Äôm a self employed contractor, and I make vastly more money from that they I could from retail, with more flexibility in scheduling.Moreover, general retail is extremely low margin, which means success is predicated on high volume, which is impossible in areas of low population density, unless you run a chain with a small central warehouse so you can buy in bulk. This is the dollar general model, and this takes more skill than running one store.Regarding restaurants, it‚Äôs important to note that most small towns with major throughways will actually get a lot of dining traffic from outsiders, possibly even a majority of traffic. Travellers seem to prefer predictable mediocrity to variance in quality. Locals don‚Äôt seem to care much one way or the other. There‚Äôs a real market gap, so it tends to be more profitable to own a franchise instead of something unique. Moreover, most dinners buy from the stand vendors anyway, so it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre making unique food anyway. I‚Äôve thought of making a farm-to-table bakery and diner on my property, but from talking to locals it would appear that most of my clientele would be tourists from a big city. Rural people like to eat processed junk food, for some reason, with the exception of retired hippies who live nearby, and the Amish, who don‚Äôt eat at non-Amish restaurants . Just my two cents.

                Ironically, as AINO becomes more diverse, we are seeing the death of dining diversity. The bland and dull food mills known as chains are a big part of the problem. Another one is that independent restauranteurs are all creating identical restaurants. Not so terribly long ago, even in mid-sized cities, one saw true French, Italian, Chinese, German, Japanese, Indian etc. restaurants. Nowadays, every independent upscale restaurant menu is a predictable melange of Chinese, Thai, Indian, Mexican and American concepts. The menus are chaotic food jumbles rather than carefully curated ensembles representing a specific cuisine. So, unless you live in a large metro area‚Äìwhich I have no interest in doing‚Äìyour best bet is to cook your own food.

                    Good example of how homogenized and ‚Äúnon-diverse‚Äù  things are actually becoming. The population itself is a  ‚Äúchaotic jumble‚Äù that no longer represents unique and diverse cultures. Corporatism requires ‚Äúglobo-homo‚Äù for efficient management.

                    Good points. On my several travels by car across the nation, I‚Äôd often stop to exercise and shop by walking around a mall. The stores are so similar you can easily forget you‚Äôre 200 or 2000 miles from your home mall. Many downtown areas are similar situation.Because I‚Äôm cheap, I‚Äôll stay in dumpy old motels if they‚Äôre available. Almost invariably the office smells like curry. I call these ‚ÄúNew Dehli Motelli‚Äù üòÄ Perhaps I‚Äôm inadvertently supporting money laundering, but I do get a trace of 1960s nostalgia from the old rooms.I too like to shop, or at last at, local. I give chains enough business, but if a local place looks good I‚Äôll try it.

            It has to said, though, that no matter how pozzed a company like Harry‚Äôs is, they did act as a relief valve on the price of disposable razors, which had reached insane levels when Gillette had a hammerlock on the market.

            Mail order razor companies is actually a pretty poor example. Cheaper razor blades, automatically delivered. Where‚Äôs the problem? Capitalism at its finest. (I‚Äôm saying that in the voice and face of Ben Wattenberg, who had a proto-neocon series on PBS on capitalism and in one episode addressed the anti-fast food hate by listing all the good things about cheap, convenient food and, holding a Big Mac, said to the camera, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù)Harry‚Äôs is woke (don‚Äôt use it myself) but so is Gillette, so the difference, again, is price and convenience. I noticed last week that Dollar Shave Club is now selling razors in the drug stores, so I suppose some kind of strategy is going on, get people hooked, raise prices and then end the mail order business? Also, I hear they are owned by Jews, so there‚Äôs that (hilariously, they tout the precision of their German supplier).Not everything is a Woke Business conspiracy.

        Interesting concept.We have to be careful. Using that argument on someone like Torba over at Gab, for example ‚Äì would be unfair.

            Gab is a actually real innovation. There is a need for open platforms, so he is creating one that is hard to knock off-line. Note that Parler is a vampire coming along to suck on that artery though. The pillow guy is doing the same thing. These sites offering nothing new. They are just drafting off Gab and other open platforms trying to keep the internet open to dissidents.
Conservative Inc. is a great example of institutional vampirism.

        Our rulers also despise economic downturns because they are about the only mechanism to reduce income and wealth inequality. Yes, poor people get hurt by downturns, but they have little to nothing to lose. The rich, on the other hand, have a lot to lose.Outside of the unusual post-WWII period from 1945 to mid 1970s, good economic times always increase wealth inequality and wealth concentration. Like the game Monopoly, money increasingly flows to asset owners.Downturns reduce the value of business assets and wipe out a lot of debt (and one man‚Äôs debt is another man‚Äôs asset). Poor people may lose their job, but their net worth doesn‚Äôt really change. It might even improve if some of their debt is wiped away. Rich people‚Äôs net worth falls dramatically.Downturns act a bit like the old debt jubilees  ‚Äì which, of course, is why TPTB aren‚Äôt so keen on them anymore.

                True. Downturns can be opportunities as well, especially when certain groups know that they‚Äôre coming.
But, historically, it‚Äôs a fact that wealth concentration and wealth inequality fall during downturns. And generally, it‚Äôs the only time that happens ‚Äì again, with the exception of ~30 years after WWII&gt;

                I‚Äôve heard, and think it plausible, that the ‚Äúmajor improvement in life and life span‚Äù attributed to modern medicine is almost entirely due to public heath measures (sewers, etc.) from the early 20th century, which massively cut down on urban plagues. Since then, it‚Äôs all itty-bitty cuts here and there. Remember when they cured cancer and heart disease? Nah, still around. And guess what‚Äôs number 3 in morality? Deaths from hospital infections and medicine side effects. Nice racket.

                    Also the increases in lifespan is a lie widely repeated by everyone. The increase in lifespan is because the average has gone up because childhood mortality is not as high. If you have two children one dies in childbirth and one lives the average lifespan of seventy to eighty the average age is around 40 . When Socrates killed himself he was in his seventies  and nobody thought he was a fantastically old man because there were a bunch of equally old men running around. The lifespan of humans has been the same for thousands of years 70 to 80

                        Whitney:  This.  If you do genealogy, you will see tons of children who died before the age of 5 and then those who lived to adulthood often lived to age 70 or 80.  Women died younger because of childbirth complications and a lack of basic cleanliness ‚Äì the public understanding of the germ theory of disease took quite a while and, as we see even now, never took a deep enough hold.Even today, both personal experience and reported studies show that half the time people do not wash their hands after using the bathroom (and both anecdote and data demonstrate that as diversity increases hand washing decreases). By far the most effective means of reducing germ transmission, fecal matter, viruses, etc. ‚Äì not a face diaper but simple soap and water.

He had had multiple compound fractures set in one of his back legs. We think he‚Äôd gotten hit by a car on the highway. The vet didn‚Äôt give him a tetanus shot despite the open, dirty wound, because cats don‚Äôt usually get tetanus. It took the vet a while to realize that‚Äôs what was going on, and to this day when I mention it to other vets, they give me that stink-eye look that means ‚ÄúYeah, layman, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚ÄùIt was indeed horrific. Worst death I‚Äôve ever seen, and I‚Äôve seen some bad ones. We kept hoping we could get him through it by keeping him on a phenobarbitol IV to help ease the muscle contractions until the toxin worked its way out of his system, but either his heart gave out from the stress or the phenobarb itself stopped his heart.

                        The fact that fewer people smoke also helps. If you look at olde tyme movie stars, it seems about every other one of them died in their 50s or 60s from lung cancer or another smoking-related disease. And they all smoked like London chimneys.

            A lot of the technological advancements of the last two decades feel like ever smaller incremental advancements.
The other thing that has occurred is the atomization of popular culture due to all the online streaming options.
That atomization is not all bad given the political bent of most celebrities.

        Good essay!  I have a personal story which fits with the premise.  For a few years, in conjunction with some doctors at a medical university, we developed an app to track disease in a community‚Äìit took a lot of thought and was clever‚Äìand, most importantly it was gaining customers and users.  Then Covid hit.  We quickly adapted the app for the new landscape (which wasn‚Äôt too difficult as all the basic work and research was done) and we figured we‚Äôd have a hit as a result of preparation hitting opportunity.  But then, the App stores took weeks and weeks to approve the new version.  By the time they approved it, both App store giants had their own disease tracking App launch and up on their App marketplace and it looked, amazingly, like ours.  We shut the App down, knowing it is not prudent to continue to innovate in a rigged system.

            This is something I‚Äôve noted many times. Our current political-economy is a form of international fascism. Instead of a combination of capital, labor and the state, it is a combination of capital, the state and the cultural commissars.

                        In the early ‚Äô90s, when globohomo/etc. first became identifiable in its current form, some academic Marxists tried to get the descriptor ‚Äúfascoid-liberal‚Äù to catch on. Of course it didn‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs weird-looking and what it means isn‚Äôt immediately obvious. Same reason ‚Äúanarcho-tyranny‚Äù is a righty nerd shibboleth and normal people will never say it, no matter how much of it they experience. The one indignity the average American always refuses is talking like a dork.

                    The most important lesson an engineer can learn during his career: ‚ÄúIn theory, theory and practice are the same; in practice they ain‚Äôt.‚ÄùRegarding the Mustachioed Man and his ‚Äúcaring‚Äù it is amazing how nostalgia can blind somebody to the facts that his singular historical legacy is the most efficient race mixing in Germany‚Äôs history. Not even counting the Slavic-Aryan mostly ‚Äúinvoluntary coupling‚Äù, within ten years of the end of his earthly activities Germany started to import Mohameddans in large numbers, first Turks, then Arabs and Africans, a true first in European history followed by the current officially approved and promoted ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù couplings.Admittedly looking back 85 years is still historically a short time but what else we can discern as ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù? Do you think that history‚Äôs judgement, whatever that is, will be any better 85 years from now when Germany will be renamed Germbabwe?

If you‚Äôre going to kill the king then you had better succeed.  Moustache Man did not succeed but you want to blame him for what the king did after the assassination attempt.
You are saying that if Moustache Man had not made his assassination attempt then Germany would be white?  The history of the USA after WW2 says otherwise.

            Those people who think companies follow the standards profits incentive of economics should have to explain the companies who had their stores burned down by rioters then display pro-BLM propaganda in their windows once they rebuilt.

                Those stores were of two varieties.
Local small businesses that were hoping the mob would see them as organic parts of the community and leave them alone.  Hell the owners may even have agreed with the protestors.
Large national chains that thought the localized losses would be more than offset by gains from positioning themselves as allies of the protests.   They were wrong, but that was the reasoning.

                    The corporate fascists, through their advertising campaigns and corporate giving, are attempting (successfully) to create a political/cultural environment in which their views are mainstream.

                I can easily explain that.The owner/managers look at the ‚Äúbig picture,‚Äù which for BLM would be some belief set like: ‚ÄúClearly Blacks have been marginalized and mistreated through America‚Äôs history. They continue to be oppressed now. We will show our solidarity with those would finally bring justice to the downtrodden, as well as punish their oppressor. By doing so we are on the winning side of history, and this has a positive effect on our public image.‚ÄùFor the inconvenience of facts like riots, mayhem, assault, murder, looted and burnt down stores, that‚Äôs easy to rationalize: ‚ÄúWell, sure there were some protests that got out of hand and and led to rioting, but mostly it was peaceful demonstrations. Besides, our insurance will cover the losses.‚ÄùNot that such positions are entirely rational, but isn‚Äôt this a case of cognitive dissonance, or 1984‚Äôs Double Think?A more interesting, deeper question would be ‚ÄúWhat, exactly, are the motives of groups like BLM and Antifa? Who is behind them? Who organizes and finances them? Long-term, will these be good or bad for us?‚Äù But those are Bad Think, and to be avoided at all cost.

                Orwell noticed the same things all those years ago:‚ÄúThe word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‚Äúsomething not desirable‚Äù‚Ä¶In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides.

                        One hallmark of fascism is that it is based on an in-group and an out-group. The fascists are the good people, and they are at war with a bad people. In AINO, the good people are negroes and the bad people are whites. It‚Äôs classical fascism alright, but with the dramatis personae inverted from the stereotypical conception of fascism.

            In Fascism, the state commands the economy and private businesses are subordinate. There is a grand idea around which the nation rallies and there is a unity ‚Äì real or forced, usually a combination of both.
What we have now is corporatism, where the businesses rule and the politicians are puppets that pull the levers of the state purely for the benefit of business. There is no grand idea, no unity, nothing organic to rally around. Instead there is only PR and suppression.

                Il Duce had the idea of completing the creation of modern Italy, started by Garibaldi and nearly destroyed by WW I. We all understand Hitler‚Äôs ideas. The ‚Äúgrand idea‚Äù today is really the opposite of these historical examples ‚Äì it is a negation of the nation (the actual people and their traditions).The ‚Äúgrand idea‚Äù today is the apotheosis of the State. The State is no longer a vehicle for Italians, or ethnic Germans or Americans, to achieve goals and development. Instead, it‚Äôs a vehicle for global corporate hegemony and it demands total submission. There need be no state religion because the religion is the State.

                According to Mussolini himself, who invented the concept  of ‚Äúfascism‚Äù as a successor to liberal ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù:
‚ÄúFascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power‚Ä¶

                This is an excellent point. Historical fascism gained its force from its appeal to nationalism. The emerging order being discussed here explicitly rejects nationalism. Rather than ‚Äòoligarchical collectivism‚Äô ‚Äì Orwell‚Äôs term of course ‚Äì perhaps we might call it ‚Äòplutocratic collectivism‚Äô.
Marx wasn‚Äôt entirely wrong about class struggle, he was just wrong about which class would prevail, as was Orwell. It turns out that capitalists are far more adaptive than Marx or Orwell ‚Äì who despised and underrated them ‚Äì could imagine. The ‚Äòpatron saint‚Äô of our emerging new system could well be Armand Hammer.

                    Marx is a materialist and a historical determinist so a romantic notion a future communist utopia is needed for the political movement to continue. If a Marxist realizes that the dialectically predetermined successor to capitalism is a thousand years of neo-feudalism he might as well off himself. The struggle becomes hopeless.

            I may be a bit of a crank on the definition of ‚Äúfascism,‚Äù but hear me out.  Right wing thinkers like Z and Maniac define fascism as ‚Äúa bond between corporations and government.‚Äù  This definition mistakes a secondary feature as the defining essence.Fascism as practiced by Mussolini and Moustache Man was about organizing a society to serve its founding people.  That is the defining essence.  The fact that realizing this goal required taming corporations is just a secondary feature.I don‚Äôt imagine that the fascists sat down and said, ‚ÄúOur main goal is to enmesh corporations and government.‚Äù  No, they probably said, ‚ÄúOur main goal is to serve our people and that may entail forcing corporations to serve the common good.‚ÄùI know that I am just arguing semantics, which is usually pointless, but it bothers me that fascists are being slandered.

                Yes, well stated. You can read about Hitler‚Äôs ‚Äúcorporation-taming‚Äù in Adam Tooze‚Äôs excellent book on the economic policy of the Third Reich (Wages of Destruction). Hitler forced a lot of mergers, consolidation and price-fixing. His tactics are debatable, but the early results were good. I think he was much more pragmatic and less ideological on this subject than Il Duce.Il Duce began his public life as a Socialist journalist and agitator. He was a lot more rooted ideologically in taming corporate power than Hitler. His problem was that he needed the big Northern Italian industrialists to achieve his political aims. He never got them under control the way Hitler did with his guys.So I think your point is excellent. These guys were nationalists first, economists second.

                [Disclaimer: I have very light knowledge of history!]
As I understood (slightly!) Italy‚Äôs or Germany‚Äôs fascism, it had firm roots in nationalism.
If we are going to term what‚Äôs happening in the USA (and perhaps other nations), it seems to me that quite the contrary is operative: marginalizing the founding stock (Whites) ‚Äî making him the Other. Perhaps the other traits of corporatism, statism, fascism are present, but nationalism? Not in any form that I can see.
It occurs to me that perhaps ‚Äúanti-fascism‚Äù is more accurate than one would think at first glance.

                It‚Äôs worth pondering the idea that distributed surveillance, network technology and private censorship has empowered thousands of cat-lady Fascists to enforce the new State religion of St. George Floyd on all of us without requiring a charismatic leader.
The Fascism of the future may end up being as dull as it is oppressive: No rousing balcony speeches or torch-lit rallies may be needed. We may just get the quotidian, gray oppression of millions of unseen tyrants.
