        What I always find striking about these triumphalist articles from the Left are that they take it as a given that America, and American politics, will all unfold along exactly the same lines that they’ve always experienced it. They lack the imagination to grasp that alternative arrangements are not only possible, but likely. It’s like they imagine that one day, the “old white people” will finally be a minority, and there will be a big vote, which the progressives will win, and then the diverse progressive coalition will ride like conquering heroes into the conservative hinterlands, where the rump right-wing minority will peacefully kneel and submit to the yoke.Yeah, it ain’t gonna happen that way, guys. Even if red states don’t actually go as far as secession, progressives might want to stop and consider that, though blacks only constitute about 12 percent of the population, there are entire black-dominated cities in this country that function essentially as independent fiefdoms, where the Black Man Reigns Supreme. Cities like Detroit and Baltimore are pretty much left to run themselves because nobody thinks it’s worth the trouble to send in a permanent military occupation force to restore order. That’s even though a “military” campaign to “invade” and “occupy” Detroit, and get it back up to First World standards, would cost far less and be far more successful than, say, trying to civilize desert tribes of the Levant through force of arms. The will just isn’t there.If progressives cannot successfully get 12 percent of the population — the 12 percent who are mostly friendly to them at the voting booth — to consistently support and implement the progressive agenda (you may have heard that blacks are generally not fans of gays, Hispanics, or feminism), what makes them think it will be a piece of cake to impose their will on hostile whites just because those hostile whites make up 40 percent of the population, instead of 51 percent?

        I always wanted to be a crime thinker, and now I have joined!
Seriously, the way the western left organises itself is an endless attempt to control every aspect of people, so naturally they have much to admire in both Islam and communism. Anything however that allows people to go their own way including making their own choices is just downright wrong, wrong, wrong. It cannot be allowed!

        We live in a two party system. Even after the demise of the Federalists, there were two wings of the Democrats. There will always be competition for office and the accompanying power. Regardless of the fate of the Republicans, the Democrats will face a crisis when one of its substantial minority groups recognize that there is only so much loot to go around.

            If we withdraw our consent for a two party system there will not be a two party system. It is there because we have been conned into thinking it was our only option.That is changing, that illusion. Reality is beginning to win.People are beginning to believe in something better. It is all around us this sense of destiny of something better.Trump as an example as a populous alternative to the cultural marxists was only possible because the illusion of legitimacy of those with their hands on the levers of power is becoming apparent to so many.

        I think that it is time to do some real planning, not just talking about tar and feathers.

            What is really important here is that law-abiding middle-class citizens are deciding that playing by the cultural marxist regime rules is nothing but a sucker’s game.A pretty cool guy by the name of John Mosby wrote this below. I think it is particularly timely, even though he wrote it about five years ago. I took it to heart upon reading it and haven’t looked back. And appropriate in light of tar feathers rails and rope time pretty much upon us. But as they say it all begins with each of us. Good preparations are a sound basis for what must be done to keep and preserve our freedoms. Nothing less will be effective. In any case this is good stuff. FYI, John Mosby is an ex Special Forces warrior who is teaching others how to be civilian warriors. Myself and many people I know have taken this missive to heart, along with John’s and others training and practical wisdom. It is most transformational and empowering in ways that are wholesome and holistic. Just as liberty learned and prepared for is, from the fuckers out to destroy this country. The more of us the better. It all begins with each of us, but the only way we are going to get through this is together, because ripping the chainsaw from the grasp of the political class as they hack away at the tree of liberty will be difficult at first but once they start folding (a quality they all share thankfully) it will come fast.“Remember:The fundamental human right to self-defense and its tools does not stem from any piece of parchment or other act of man.It is much more elemental than that.I have more principled reasons for my stand on owning firearms, and I don’t care one whit in the world for the Second Amendment. It means nothing to me. My rights have nothing to do with the U.S. Constitution, and when it dawns on people that it has finally been erased — the principal danger of all political premises posed as “social contracts” — my rights will still validly exist, even if I die defending them. I own firearms because I have a right to private property. That is the First Thing.…As the Regime takes off the gloves, every day it creates tens of thousands more American Patriots who realize yes, it really probably is going to get that bad, so really, they may not have that much to lose after all.So why not stop being afraid and stand up to the Regime?Join the honorable Resistance, or make your own. Garden, cook at home, teach your children, and get right with the Lord. Cut expenses, avoid taxes, learn new skills, and build savings of tangible real assets. Train, stockpile, recruit, prepare, guard, protect, and defend.Make this your finest hour. -John MosbyThese Axioms below are appropriate to your comment above also I think.“You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end – which you can never afford to lose – with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.” -Vice Admiral James Bond Stockdale, USN“Of course, there is a risk, but only from a tyrannical and oppressive government bent on the absolute destruction of a free society.” -TL Davis

                I was thinking more along the lines of
• Remonetization• Recapitalization of assets• Demonopolization (trust busting, especially of the banks)• What in God’s name do we do with all of the national, state, and municipal debt?• Etc.
In other words the things we will have to during and immediately after the “crisis” to keep trade from stopping and to prevent millions from starving.

                    Gonna have to bite the bullet on that debt.Let it go. Its nothing but blue sky based on blue sky now.The intrinsic value was skimmed off and long gone.I understand what your saying, but somebody is going to have to pay it off if your suggestions would to be followed. In a sane world sure, by all means. But it was insanity that created this mountain of debt to begin with. Guess who is going to get the privilege of paying it off? The ones who are the productive members of society, who where robbed of their intrinsic prosperity to begin with. No one else produces wealth. So they way I see it, debt creation is a system of theft of the productive, and then the productive have to then repay that debt to save the system of debt.Something inherently wrong there.I think its called slavery if I’m not mistaken.Its tacit and cunning, but it is a form of serfdom by any other name.But if your a beneficiary of that debt creation, then sure, that works great.One day not to soon, those who are the producers are going to withdraw consent in increasing numbers, it has already begun, and the matter is going to be self solving.

                        Let the debt holders eat it. They were just as insane to buy it as the Fed was to issue it. Might be a big return to sanity when it’s all over.

        The only difference between the human extinction movement aka the democratic party, aka the cultural marxists and islam, is islam is in an active process of physically and openly, overtly, without having the problem of creating an illusion of legitimacy to obtain power to implement its ideology of liquidating all who don’t fall within its ideology.In simplest terms, the caliphate uses guns bombs knives and terror to impose its agenda.The cultural marxist use others to do the same thing.It is a no brainer why they adore islam.Everyone else is naturally guilty of apostasy.

            They adore Islam mostly because they can’t see past skin color and because Islam is detrimental to the West, which makes loving Muslims/Islam an act of virtue and kindness, signifying that one loves “the Other” and is self-sacrificing in doing so, even though on a personal level they sacrifice nothing. After all, it’s easy to love oneself and one’s friend, but loving one’s enemy is difficult and therefore considered a true act of devotion, even when it’s at the expense of one’s fellow man.Mixed in and feeding into that with is the notion that because Nazism was evil, the only possible evil in the world is to view another ethnic group as dangerous (which in turn implies that danger can only come from within Western society and never from outside it), instead one should consider oneself to be dangerous, hence this Church’s obsession with ‘man made global warming’.Now add to that the fact that this being the dominant ethos of our age, it is that ones who are most puritanical and irrational in their devotion to that ethos who get to boss others around, since everyone who won’t go as far as them can be presented as a possible heretic, recalling the dark ages and the witch hunts and the witchfinder general and the inquisitions; in each case an ethos most people believe in gives a distinct advantage to nutcases who constantly accuse others of not being sufficiently devout. One could argue that this also happens in Islam, since by definition the nutcases get to accuse any muslims with a sane ideology of being insufficiently devoted to Islam. There the dominant ethos is Islam and ensuring that Islam dominates other faiths, leading to suicide bombings and to using civilians as human shields. Even their human shields believe that they should be willing to be martyrs, since to refuse to die suggests they’re skeptical regarding the faith.The human mind is a perfect nesting place for ideas and ideologies but isn’t well enough developed to cope with them. It hasn’t had millions or hundreds of thousands of years of evolution in an environment of ideas to adapt to coping with them and to recognize limits.
