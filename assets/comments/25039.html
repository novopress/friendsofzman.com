        They see reality as misinformation, because it refuses to yield to their version of reality–That’s a good quip.
The article also brought to mind the now adult child of an acquaintance who is looking to land on the D.C. cloud.  On paper this person grew up a near pauper in flyover state, but in actuality they grew up a well-to-do Cloud-Person franchise and never had to worry about anything at all their entire life.

        Also, “Living in Isolation” immediately calls to mind that great old Cars tune, “Moving in Stereo,” and now every man of a certain age has that one scene fromFast Times at Ridgemont Highin his head….
…you’re welcome, because I know you needed something like that this morning.

        I lived in DC a number of years until I escaped and Z describes it just as it is. If you’re there, get out. If not, never go there, even for a vacation. Raise your family among good people outside not just DC but the other rotten cities.

            When your kids get to a certain age, it may be a good teaching tool to take them there for a couple of days so they can understand how the city has become a class apart from the rest of the country.  Who knows how many of the city’s tourist attractions will be torn down or replaced in the next 10 years.

                Barnard:  I tried that (years ago – well prior to the fence and other defensive fortifications in Tubman, DF (and also took my boys out of nostalgia for all the school field trips and tours for visiting relatives).  The National Geographic museum is in a highly questionable area and now filled with brown children and exhibits which match their interests.  The Smithsonian is a totally owned outpost of Diversity, Inc., complete with ‘fellow whites’ at the top and lots of exhibits about the history of the evil rayciss entity and its stale, male, murderous and miscegenating settlers.  While the elephant in one of the museums was still there, the large Foucault’s Pendulum was removed in 1998. The gunboat Philadelphia is apparently still there, but soon to be joined by an exhibit about a slave ship.  Be warned.My older boy did enjoy the Marine Corps Museum (first saw it as a small space in the Marine Barracks in DC, and later at its new site near Quantico, VA).  I will regret the loss of the Folger Shakespeare library, if it hasn’t already been gutted from within by the woke, and the Library of Congress stacks and old reading room, where I spent much pleasant time.

        Of the many things I got wrong about the internet, the wrongest was: I thought it would increase accountability. Used to joke about it with undergrads: No historian will ever come back and *prove* that I loved hair metal, because there’s no documentation. You’ll just have to take my word for it. But for you people…Not only is that not true, it’s somehow mega-false. Despite clear video evidence, if it’s on the internet, it’s not REAL. Ok, yeah, your Facebook feed is full of you saying X yesterday, and now you’re insisting Y, but… somehow it doesn’t matter, because internet.I can’t explain it, but it enables all their behavior.

            It’s the eternal present.
People forget what happened yesterday and can’t project what will happen tomorrow.  Only right now matters – and really only how onefeelsright now.   The only point of the digital eternal documentation is to provide fodder for outrage now.

            I also though the same as you many moons ago. But it looks as though the current crop of ‘academics’ care more about currying favour with the latest fad, than truth.
I see no reason to expect that whoever is languishing in the ivory tower of academia in the next generation will see fit to change that.

        I don’t see any way out of it,there needs to be some sort of separation. We need a divorces. I don’t think there needs to be plans, separate first, then figure out the society.

        Excellent piece. This is one of the reasons I have problems with the “international zit-mason conspiracy” thing. The elite classes really are 1. stupid 2. believe this shit. Really, really believe this gnostic, reconstitution-of-being shit.
That said, it’s obvious that they are seeking to “elect a new people” and so much be destroyed.

            “Allowing a man with dementia to make life-and-death decisions for a nation and for the West is reckless and dangerous.”
Biden doesn’t make decisions. He’s the governor in BLAZING SADDLES  signing everything Harvey Corman rapidly places in front of him. Although that has been true of every president since Clinton, the other three were not vegetables (although evidence indicates Obama was a fruit).The danger is the Regents aren’t all that sharp and sane, either.

                Survival is the real reason, although if read  I said “Organize, then speak of Tree of Liberty.”
This would mean reading the Z article as well.
As to why organize?Well.Don’t then.

            Xiao Bai-Dung is coming to CA for a campaign event in support of Newscum.  At least that’s the rumor.There’s been no official announcement of such for either the governors office or the president’s.Long Beach city college where the event will theoretically be held has announced tight security, including shutting down access to multiple buildings for a “special event” without specifying what the event is. Other than it is invitation only.So it appears some sort of secret campaign rally.Which is simultaneously completely ridiculous and totally inline with our imperial kabuki system.   The college is likely the stage for thoroughly scripted campaign rally-show to be broadcast demonstrating the popularity of our supreme leader.

If their tapping Bush to give Biden’s 9/11 speech is any indication, they’re just trying to bury Potato Joe in a plausible hole.

            Agreed, but history has not be kind to rulers who bring in mercenaries to overwhelm their ancient enemies. Typically, the mercenaries realize that they are stronger than the ruler who brought them to this new land and take over.
I suspect that something similar will happen here. “My fellow Mexicans, Indians and Asians” is hard to pull off when you’re very different looking.
