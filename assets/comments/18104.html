        Doesn’t matter what these Yahoos and YaJoos think. They can point and sputter all day about the evils of biological nationalism – as though there’s another kind – to their cuck audience. It’s coming.The Dems are on the cusp on permanently controlling the White House, and, therefore, the judiciary and bureaucracy. And the Dems are all in on tribalism, including pointing out the existence of the ruling tribe. Whites – and Jews – are about to get tribalism good and hard. All the virtual signalling in the world won’t protect whites from an Andy-like roll in the hay with the “sisters” in Shawshank Redemption.Jesus, even the tribe has grown fat and lazy. Like their stupid, “I don’t see color,” Rotary Club sidekicks, they can’t imagine a world where they’re not in charge, where someone challenges them, where another group is as tribal as they are. Fuck nuts, look around. The Indians are coming. The Asians are coming. Even idiotic Muslims are coming.They all hate you! They all think like you! They all know what you’re doing and aren’t afraid pointing it out! And most of all, they all want to be where you are now!The days of whites getting away with their above-it-all attitude toward race is coming to an end, like it or not. So are the days of Jews getting to have their chocolate babka and eat it too. Jews won’t be able to be both “one of them” and completely separate with Indians or Asians or Muslims or blacks or Hispanics. They’ll be fucking Jews, just another tribe scrambling to grab as much of the pie as other tribes.How Z doesn’t bitch slap every person at the conference is a wonder.

            Citizen:  You’re on a roll today.  Lots of excellent comments – one reason we all like to hangout at Zman’s place – it’s generally free of the pontificating, boring, civnat boomertards that have made iSteve such a turgid, repetitive place.  Plus Zman doesn’t moderate comments for days, even if when one disagrees with him.  Nor does he term those who disagree idiots and ban them.

            Sounds to me like a bunch of Jews trying to yet again co-op one of our movements. Any hint of whites starting to think like the tribe inevitably leads to a flock of Jews and their money to parachute into the area and take over.

                Harzony’s “new” nationalism is another (((Trotskyite))) entry/gatekeeping ploy.  Give him any rope and he will hang a Con, Inc size albatross around the neck of white nationalism.  Drive this Gypsy from our midst.

                I was kind of surprised how obvious this attempt was, it must be aimed at boomers or something.
I could imagine a much more appealing, less obviously Israeli version of fake nationalism. That would be a threat, people are desperately looking for something.
This isn’t even close to Trump’s 2016 fake nationalism

                I just watched Lindsey Graham half heartily defending Trump concerning the “go back to where you came from”  comments directed at the commie 4.
About the first words out of Lindsey’s  mouth were something about ” They hate Israel and are anti-semitic.”   Then he said Trump should not have said what he did.
I could not possibly care less if these people hate Israel.  I am concerned that they hate America and the founding stock.   As a U.S. Senator his first thought should be how events affect America.  Not Israel.

        Tucker was back at it again tonight. He started off really well, describing the leftward drift of the Democrats as a result of the Four POC Women who seem to be leading the party over the falls. When he’s finished eviscerating them, he welcomed his guest. A negro then comes on to carry water for Tucker and praise Trump for getting black unemployment so low. We whites are supposed to gush about this, I guess. No wonder Carlson showed up at that event today. He loves to play in liberal sandboxes.

                It’s impossible for us to “purity spiral” against Tucker, he’s a powerful and wealthy figure with a huge platform and we are some guys in the comments section of a blog. He won’t be “scared off” by us, we don’t effect him.All we can do is offer a dispassionate analysis of his strengths and weaknesses.Tucker seems to push the envelope on populist issues and may even hint at knowledge of the… uhh… globalist elitesBut I’m not convinced he is actually pushing the envelope on race, there are dog whistles he could be using that he isn’t using, he may actually mean what he says when he constantly recites the platitudes about color blindness. IE: He might just be a populist CivNatHis association with this ridiculous conference is also noteworthy.If Tucker is an earnest Civ Nat Populist, that’s one thing, but if he’s a Civ Nat in Israel’s pocket, that’s quite another.

                    WRT Tucker: Trust . . . but verify.  He may be a closet DR, and building his brand until he’s too big to seriously injure, and in the meantime, has to walk a fine line (pushing some issues here, counterbalance with a virtue signal there).  Or, he may be taking us for a ride.  But at least he gets some DR points into mainstream consciousness.

            I don’t necessarily disagree, but I think Tucker’s objective is to keep the Dems out of the White House, keep the Senate, and maybe even take back the House.  To achieve this end, he pushes certain narratives much like Trump himself.  How to win the election?Objective 1:scare the normies, especially the swing voters.  Do that by making the Foreign Four the new face of the Dem party.  He was pushing that hard last night.  Also make Antifa the Street Action Auxiliary of the Dem party.    Also pushed that.Objective 2:Accept that AIPAC and The Nose are too powerful right now to piss off, so don’t.  And as a bonus, force the Pelosi to defend the FF, who spout out against The Nose.  Infighting.  Divide and conquer. Part of that strategy includes presenting a few Erudite Blacks as role models to let the most loyal Dem base know that they don’t have to live like this.  Every bit helps.

        Your first paragraph persuades me that I don’t want to hear more about these people. Only immigration that interests me is negative immigration: no green cards, no H1Bs, no naturalizations, wall, deportations, Official English. Maybe 100 genius visas for authentic world-historical geniuses, but that number may be too way too high.

            Glenfilthtie: re: “all in good time” is such a good reminder,I had no knowledge of george’s reference above to Donald’s response to the Brown Four Congress Femi n a z i s, of “go back to where you came from.”So just this morning, in some post-workout conversation (only ladies were present) I shared an anecdote with a fellow swimmer.Story was essentially: my response to a crabby old French lady years ago who thought she owned our local pool and thus was allowed to be snarky and bossy to rest of us. Eventually I got tired of it, and said “if you don’t like it here, go back to France where you came from.”The great part about it was that I used HER native tongue to address her discontent. And while I was at it, I used the (in this case) pejorative “tu” form of “you” rather than the more respectful “vous,” given her age , relative to my  own.As I relayed this “crabby French lady” pool story just this morning, my fellow athlete’s response was: “OK, thank s Trump!”Being taken aback by the unexpected response, I let it go (which is somewhat unusual given my fiery nature and general passion for these issues).Then I thought about this gang here and being patient, and staying quiet. Her time will come. And I made a mental note. When The Troubles arrive, there is another added to a lit.But as Glenfilthie says above: “all in good time.”

        You can’t compare people that built a civilization out of wilderness to people show up wanting guaranteed housing and food and Medical Care.

        You’ll like this, I think.  Limbaugh spent quite a bit of time making the point that Tlaib, AOC, et al act as though being a US citizen has to do with “magic dirt”: that is, merely being on US soil is sufficient for citizenship.  He made it clear that he does not like their “magic dirt” theory.
And yes, they can leave any damn time they want.  I’ll chip in.

            Conservatives promoted the magic dirt theory for decades
Omar, AOC and Tlaib are what they got.
AOC is a fake, but I enjoy the other two, to rub the boomer’s faces in the diversity that they spend decades defending.
“As long as they come in legally”
It’s far better to have the boomers realize their error now, than to have a soothing, non-confrontational replacement.

        If you attended Rich Lowry’s breakout session and got through it without laughing that would be impressive.  I would guess Tucker’s staff reads a lot online and gives him recaps of what they find interesting and worth his time.  A couple of them must be at least sympathetic to reality based on what makes onto to his show.

        &gt;&gt;&gt;but she made it clear that America is for everyone as long as they agree on the rules.&lt;&lt;&lt;
And those rules are the result of millennia of Anglo/Nordic Heritage, which itself is underpinned by Anglo/Nordic biology.
If we can agree on that, I’ve no issue with finding common ground with CivNats.

My point is that if CivNats agree that traditional (pre-65) Americanism has a biological basis, then it becomes de facto racial nationalism.

Your “Anglo/Nordic” rules are irrelevant to the brown tsunami. “But she made it clear that America is for everyone as long as they agree on the rules.” This women is just another numbskull living in a comfortable bubble. If she lived in a neighborhood full of blacks and browns and could see who they really are, she would hall ass down to the border wearing camouflage and holding a machine gun.   .

            I was kind of surprised by the failure of a real civic nationalism to emerge post Trump.What we call civic nationalism today is just mainstream conservative or yesterday’s liberalism, it still accepts recent immigrants as more American than racist Americans and just wants Americans to be replaced legally.There was little or no ideological development post Trump, we just ended up with generic, zero-ideas mainstream conservatives in the MAGA camp and White Nationalists on the outside. Mostly Trump just made conservatives more pro-gay.I guess you can see hints of authentic American civic nationalism in people like Ann Coulter, who feels more attached / paternalistic towards groups that were here pre-1965. (Unfortunately for her, those groups turned out to be really easy for the left to radicalize against Whites)Probably any real civic American nationalism was forced to concern itself with demographics, so it got classified as White Nationalism and censored / de-platformed / excluded from government.The thing that calls itself civic nationalism today can’t be compromised with, it’s just an extension of liberalism and the tribe.

                        Maybe it works better if real nationalists do it.
And it makes sense: we want what Israel have: a country of our own. We should tout Israel as a role model, and never stop praising them as loud as we can for their sensible immigration policy.
Let the Israel Firsters suck on that: we’re more pro-Israel than the neocons, we want the whole world to be like Israel, not just Israel.

                            Feel free to try. You will get some support from the kind of people who attended the Israel conference Zman describes above.But it’s a bad idea, Israel is not a real nation, it is not a nation that practices morally defensible values that we would want to emulate.It’s the headquarters of an international criminal network. It is practicing theft, rape, genocide and colonialism. The bad kind of colonialism.Equating yourself to Israel is basically declaring your intent to commit horrible crimes against the rest of the world.Since we are in a position of weakness, doing that isn’t a good idea, it just encourages people to help finish us off.Our position is more akin to the position that the Palestinians are in. Framing it that way provides a basis for cooperation among Nationalists. (We all have a shared interest in stopping the crimes being committed by the empire.)

Normie doesn’t consider Israel a state criminal, he considers Israel a plucky underdog. My plan would leverage pro-Israeli propaganda to our advantage.
And white Americans are nowhere near the position of the Palestinians, that’s almost an insult. The Palestinians are a bunch of whiney, histrionic losers, topping the list of “Most Unwanted Immigrants”, right below Somalis.

If your values are based in nationalism, then “being a good immigrant” doesn’t rank in the list of positive qualities, they are supposed to be annoying. But they’ve endured a lot of hardship and sacrificed a lot in their effort to achieve self determination, we can’t say the same.

                                            Basically all gate keepers who want to move beyond pure classical liberal CivNat hit on the idea  of complaining about Muslims, sucking up to Israel, while begging to be allowed to have borders.Lauren Southern, The Golden One, Tommy Robinson, Rebel Media, that kind of stuff.It has been going on all along. This is an approach that all young people have been exposed to and most have moved on from. Feel free to try another version of it, but it is not innovative, and it ultimately doesn’t address the most important issue; America isn’t an independent nation and the Kushners won’t let you have nationalism.

                I enjoy Carlson’s show. I watch it every night, in fact. But I can’t help thinking that there’s got to be a catch. Back when Bubba was in the White House, I listened to Rush Limbaugh. He was hilarious, and said a great many things that needed to be said. But once Bush II was in office, I realized that Limbaugh was just a partisan hack. Shame on me for taking so long to figure that out.

                    Tucker openly embraces such oldies but goodies as the universalism of the founding, America is a proposition nation, we are nation of immigrants, and the donkeys are the real racists.

Yes, its great when he is slamming the Muzziette from Minneapolis / St. Mogadishu, but disheartening when he turns to a guest who frames Omar’s speech as, uber alles, anti-semitic, and an attack on the “only democracy in the middle east.”

                        He spouts them, But I don’t know if he embraces them.  He does know who butters his bread, so he has to give his pinch of incense here and there.  Whether he’s tossing incense to the DR or TPTB, hard to say.  But at least some of the right talking points get exposed through him.

        Z Man said: “The funny thing about this event is not a single person has bothered to mention that conservatism, whether neocon or Buckley, managed to conserve nothing. Further, they don’t put any thought into why it failed. They just seem to think if they can go back and do it all over again, the results will be different somehow. Not only is that impossible, it fails to address the internal defects of conservatism. The reason we are at this place, is the so-called conservatives chose to embrace Progressive morality….”  I’m sure everybody here has read this quote by Robert Lewis Dabney, but it bears repeating.https://www.counter-currents.com/2012/11/robert-lewis-dabney-on-conservatism/

Personally, I just think these people are nostalgic and what to get the band back together. In the hay day of the buckley cartel they were young and full of hope. They had a long run, but now it’s fading away. The buckley years where like Wood Stock for square middleclass conservatives .

        It doesn’t matter what these Yahoos and YaJoos think about biological nationalsm – as though there’s another kind. It’s coming.The Dems are on the cusp of permanently controlling the presidency, which also means controlling the judiciary and the bureaucracy. And the Dems are all in on tribalism, including pointing out the current ruling tribe. Whites – and Jews – are about to get to know tribalism about as gently as the Andy got to know the sisters in Shawshank Redemption.Like so many generals in history, American Jews are fighting the last war. They still think that the big danger is Europeans and their diaspora when the real danger just keeps marching toward them.Look around fuck nuts. The Indians are coming. The Asians are coming. The Muslims are coming. And they’re all just as tribal as you are. The days of you getting to have your chocolate babka and eating too are over. Unlike idiotic gentile whites, these groups will never accept you as “one of them” while simultaneously letting your act in your own interests.You know why? Because it’s fucking stupid and suicidal.Jews worry about the Nazi bogeyman while groups as tribal as they are make inroads. I never thought any group could be as stupid as gentile whites, but American Jews are making a run at it.

            Come now.  After they murdered Czar Alexander, father of Nicholas, they unexpectedly heard the sound of Cossack hoofbeats!
Having suddenly discovered they had been historically pogrommed, they fled to America and started lighting off anarchist’s bombs in public squares.
So. Oppressed.  Just like the Brown of Four!

        I’ll tell you whether I’m a racist or not once someone actually defines the term. As it is, I find nothing shameful about the term, but I’m happy to recoil in horror if it turns out the word means something really bad, like someone who notices the divided loyalty of certain people….

            For example, I noticed that blacks are about 14% of the US population, and black men make up about 6% of the US population, but black men make up about 70% of the NFL and about 74% of the NBA.  Is it racist to notice this disparity?  If i say, hey, it looks like black men appear to be particularly gifted at sportsball activities, is that racist of me? if so, why?

        Orange Bad Man tweets against Prog squad with one hand – distraction.And a much needed boost for all our morale.  We’ve all been dying to tell them to GTFO all our lives.
But with the other hand he adjusts the Federal Register to end asylum on Mexican Border.
Brilliant, and his pattern.

Never let a crisis go to waste.This is about building a long-term momentum, a sea-change, after our long civnat slumber.

All I can do is hope Trump is overdoing it to send a hidden message, an S.O.S.!– he’s “draping himself in an Israeli flag”.
