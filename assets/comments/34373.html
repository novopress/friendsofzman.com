        On this side of the aisle there are many who think these people see the entire chessboard 500 steps ahead. But it seems like Israel has the same blind spots we do, if not worse. Iran fixed their air defense within hours and brought in new military guys to replace the ones that Israel killed, and it’s like Israel and the US have no idea what to do next except ratchet it up. Iran has no reason to surrender after a decapitation strike that didn’t decapitate it. The fact that they are out today claiming that Iran committed a war crime by doing the same things they did in Gaza hundreds of times tells me that they’re kind of out of ideas here.The problem for us vis a vis China is that we are incompetent. I suspect that China is quite content to sit around and let the US destroy itself, and will be happy to aid Iran in order to speed that up.

            Won’t China be happy to aid Iran because they source 30% of their oil from Iran?
Doesn’t Japan also source a ton of oil from Iran? They can’t be happy about the current situation.

                That would be one of the aims of the war. Destroying Japan is near the top of America’s to-do list, since so many view them admiringly, as a lone Western (Western enough) holdout against globohomo. Currently we’re destroying them the traditional way, by teaching them to hate white people (“tourists”) and flooding them with Nigerians and Indians. It’s not happening fast enough. They’re stillincrediblycivilized, compared to the rest of us. So, shut off the boats (except the ones full of Nigerians and Indians).

This was absolutely breathtaking!  The chutzpah of these people.  They are calling it a war crime!

                        There’s a post on X claiming that part of the hospital had been taken over by the military (complete with photos of soldiers in the hospital). Others say the hospital was treating military patients. In any case, the IDF didn’t hesitate to obliterate hospitals in Gaza, on the pretext that Hamas had HQ buried under them. It’s difficult to get too weepy over it.

                    Anna, stop. Just stop. There are no “war” crimes. There is just war. When nations face off in hot battle, terrible things happen. The “hospital” meme has been worked to death since 1914. Personally, I would love it if wars could be fought without any one getting hurt. For instance, “our” greatest victory in the Cold War happened when Bobby Fischer defeated Boris Spassky for the world chess title in 1972.* Or when the US hockey team took down the “Soviet Menace” at Lake Placid in 1980.Seriously, these were major events in the Cold War. Ah, the innocence of it all…Point being, Israel has chosen to engage in “hot” warfare, with whatever consequences that follow,*After the end of the Cold War and people got to know each other better, we learned that Fischer was a lunatic, and that Spassky was a pretty cool guy.

                Someone in the US military didn’t get the memo that you cannot criticize those who rule over you.  Now I have no love for the Palestinians, either (don’t trust people who won’t eat bacon), but Israel apparently just happened to ‘find’ this account on twitter/X and doxed the guy.  Note that I also don’t trust the US military (yeah, yeah, Trump is getting rid of the trannies – but not the homos, lesbians, mestizos, womyn, etc.), and the guy should have better hidden his identity, but this is still highly educational.https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/pentagon-officer-removed-over-anti-israel-posts-internal-probe-launched/3602771

                        My ‘tribe’ is White Europeans who created Western Civilization.  The Palestinians had/have no part of that.  And as a Christian, I do not consider the Middle East a “holy land.”  Jesus is holy, not the dirt he happened to trod on while in human form.

                    Superficially, the Chinese seem more like the Victorian Jews who sold us chalked milk and sawdust bread than like thesadistic zookeeperJews we have today. The Anglosphere longs for retvrn.
(Apple appears to have removed “Anglosphere” from its automatic spell check since last time I typed it. Neat.)
Of course the Jews back then were incredibly sadistic toward their own people, like the Chinese are now. “Pogroms” were often rescues of ghetto Jews from rabbinical tyranny (because it violated royal sovereignty).
But never mind. There are no lessons in the past. Only fresh air.

                I’m sure the Chinese will eventually use their bio-engineering skills to produce a clone army like in the Star Wars movie. They must be close to having an artificial womb by now. It’ll make their sex ratio problem worse but that’s what the sexbots are for isn’t it? Meanwhile the globohomo countries use the same technology to turn their populations into a mass of womyn and trannies.

            The chessboard is not that complicated. You always want to retain the edge over your potential enemy. When he appears to be queening a pawn, you want to intercept him before that happens. In Israel’s case, Iran appears to be enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels and tools exist to build a proto-bomb. Israel, beset by fears that it won’t be the only nuke kid in the neighborhood anymore, doesn’t like that, obviously. As the tension ratchets up, the right-wing government in Jerusalem takes it upon itself to advance to the next step: knock all Iran’s pieces off the board with a sideways sweep of the hand. It worked for America against WW2 Japan, after all…— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

        I’m not sure if it’s blackmail, maybe there’s a list somewhere in a vault in Mossad HQ that makes the Epstein list look innocuous. But there is something that makes everyone in DC absolutely petrified of Israel and the lobby. It’s insane to watch from the outside but there’s a giant dark secret there that can only be observed indirectly by its effects. Like dark matter changing the path of light. And it must exist. You’d almost think they have the seven plagues boxed up in a basement in Tel Aviv by the observed force it holds on Trump and everyone else in DC

                                    Yeah, that’s funny and it is also false. Women’s suffrage and Prohibition were “successful social movements” and were spear-headed by stone-hearted lesbians. Take a look – if you dare – at the faces of Carrie Nation, Susan B. Anthony, and the rest of them. Miserable people who succeeded in imposing their misery on the entire country.

                                So true. The whole “lots of leg” bait was interesting in 1995, but now just stock comedy. FOX beclowns itself with this formula, but I suppose that they know their demo is normiecons in their 70s and 80s who still dig the legs. And this is the “opposition” in the mainstream media?
I want an EMP. I haven’t stocked up on much food but I have purchased an arsenal of butane lighters. They’ll be money in the after-times.

                                    lol EMP yeah I think I get your wavelength.  There’s a lotta dross around, no joke.And Fox certainly knows its target audience well. . . I’d guess white males, moderate – conservative, 55 – 80 range.  Strong Christian skew.The blondies are the women they can still dream about pulling.  Most men live all their adult lives with dreams of the landing the Big One, sexually speaking.  Females that have always been well out of reach, that is.  The FOXettes fill the bill.It’s v cynical but it does work.  Hypnotic, in a ‘news’ comfort zone decade after decade.  Not so different from Larry Leftie and his NPR, really.  A little sex sizzle with Fox to finalize the sale.

At least they used to be.
Personally, it’s been years since I’ve seen even just a legit HB7, and my hometown used to be plush with Playboy Centerfolds.
The obesity epidemic plus the Clot Shots have certainly not helped to em-beautify the White Christian Race.

                    The whole girlboss phenomenon is a mystery to me. Why you would entrust your multibillion dollar enterprise to the weakest vessel in the universe, known for its cowardice, lack of imagination and for thinking INSIDE the box, is a question only future historians can answer. We are living in dark times indeed.

                        Sir, we grill several times a week. All meat from a local producer, on a gas grill. Our stock of propane is considerable. I have never understood why being called a griller is an insult. Heating processed meals in the oven or microwave is not what we do. Nor are we vegetarians or vegans. We have to eat. I suppose we could live on canned tuna and breakfast cereal. Not sure how to satisfy the requirement here, to stay on the correct side of the “great divide”.OK, I “get” the “griller” moniker. It’s like the “Karen” moniker. I happen to know a couple of women named Karen who are excellent people. And I know some grillers whose primary concern in life – outside of the state of their investments – is hosting football parties as they, indeed, grill meat.So grill on, my friend. Grilling is something that one does, like fishing or collecting antiques. It’s not an evasion or an escape. It’s just one of the things normal people do.

                            If you haven’t gotten your Coleman matchlight propane stove yet, they appear to be sold out everywhere. I don’t mind cooking outside in decent weather but trying to cook a pork chop in a sandstorm/snowstorm is too much. One quart bottle of propane will provide one hour of cooking time so if you are quick and efficient you could make it last almost a week in a back room with the door closed and a window cracked open.

                            I grill and BBQ but plenty. Did a rack of baby backs yesterday. And I have no problem with the derisory epithet Griller. There are those of us who grill and have some understanding of political reality, but the vast majority of those who grill frequently also worship negroes and Israel and think voting harder is the ticket to success. I don’t necessarily feel raw contempt for such people, but I do find them exasperating and a bit pathetic.

                        A friend who wrote a book about a somewhat famous unsolved murder was given all “the files,” local and state and fed, bureaucratic and evidentiary and summary, enough to make a standard rental storage garage hard to walk through. He’s kind of a big shot and it’s a case nobody has any “narratives” about, so everyone was cooperative, happy to be rid of their old junk.What’s in there? Nothing but a reminder that cops don’t solve crimes. “The files” look just like the “JFK files” we’ve seen, bureaucratic effluvia with some odd trivia scattered around (some of it implicatory re: other crimes). What are the “Epstein files?” A collection of amateur porn featuring the world’s least attractive men, and an index of it.The “Israel” of the stories we’re told—we didn’t make them up ourselves—the near-omniscient villain of/from/withthe files, sounds very scary. That’s the op. Rather likeMunich, made to tell you you’ll never get away with it, so don’t try anything.

                I just realized nothing will kick off Jihad in Europe like Israel dicking around in an openly religious war with a major Islamic country.
Look at the reaction to Palestine. Iran is a lot bigger than Palestine is.
Update: Jeebus. Jewish NGOs moved the Replacement soldiers in…and No Kings kicked off on the same day the war started. It’s a signal, the baloon has gone up.   (No Kings was actually the largest “protest” in American history, 4.6 million participants.)

                    Let me be impolite and add a seperate comment.One gal discovered the secret to the Left. Our main complaint is we can’t organize, right?That’s what these “protests”, since the 60s, are.They’re a networking event.They’re a party- a big, stupid, fun party.They don’t have any other purpose. The Daily Cause is just an excuse to throw a party. It’s a third space where people can go meet other people without having to spend money.The purpose is for activists to recruit other activists. That’s it.The professionals even have metrics and goals: the goal is recruiting 3.5% of the population as activists.People meet other people of like mind who speak each others language, and they naturally form a parallel society and economy. They hire each other first, since they have mutual experiences. “Hey man, I was at that scene in Portland too!”They end up creating a parallel society that supports its members in good times or bad-it might be as little as a crash pad for the night, or as much as recommending a buddy for the executive suite. It’s a fraternity and sorority.The Church of Activism is motion for the sake of motion, activism for the sake of activism, and it’s open to all. They’re there to rub shoulders, not to sell trinkets or tickets to some rockstar event.Mindless fun in mutual experience, herding and mooing, flocking and cawing, is the secret to the Left’s superpower.

Both sides cannot be correct. The “unconditional surrender” side has a pretty clear and longstanding agenda.

            Another 3-2-1 possibility is that Jews have threatened to murder Trump and some or all of his children, which they will then blame on the Iranians.The simple explanation makes more sense than anything else: the man is afraid.The final redpill, which moderate commentators are either too big-brained to understand or too chickenshit to admit, is that this is a fight between Good and Evil.  The enemy understands this, but our best and brightest like to pretend otherwise or go in for hairsplitting rather than just state the obvious: it’s either Us or Them.We are Good.  They are Evil.When dealing with the masses, whatever level they have sunk to, this is where you begin.  If you start out talking about “fiat currency” or “managerialism” or “preserving genetic inheritance” then you might as well go piss into the wind.

                Give him time. Of course, Hannity’s go-to has nothing to do with nuns. Throwing sodomites off buildings and stoning “loose” women to death are his top cards, because his main concern is “owning the libs”, just as Rush was doing back when this sort of thing sounded fresh and edgy in 1993.

And then there is the Left: “if you don’t think the worst human being on the planet is DJT, “F*CK YOU”.

                    Funny how that phrase goes hand-in-hand with people who simultaneously argue each nation should be able to protect and promote its natural resources, and/or piously intone ‘free trade.’  As if access to oil is an inherent, natural ‘right’ guaranteed in the magic constitution.

            I’m not so sure. Trump did a quiet diplomacy tour and seemed to get agreement from all the principals. Russia offered to take the material for processing, in return, Hegseth dropped Ukraine. China got concessions of some kind – meanwhile, they are arming Iran in order to prolong a war of attritionwith Israel.The neighbors would happily weaken or eliminate a powerful competitor for a more tractable regime. Trade with the strong horse is still a better deal for them in the long run than with a troublemaking mafiosi. The Ayatollah’s distilleries in Russia aren’t winning the love of the people.I think Trump is wagering big – if he can do regime change right, he can set a precedent for a generation. At least, this one is #7, so maybe the 1996 Clean Break will be sated – and the Israel lobby is being seriously weakened like it has never been before.Absent the Palestinian cause, the other countries have little to rally around, despite their grumbles about the Bully and its bulldog.

            He cannot think systematically or strategically. Nah, scrap that last sentence. He just cannot think, period. And ironically, that’s part of his appeal to the MAGA crowd, which in large part can’t think either. Memes, slogans, trash talk — that’s the order of the day.

                Trump is blessed with horrible enemies.The Dems to wo/man are on X bemoaning the the fact that the Supreme Court affirmed the legalities of laws that restrict the medical establishment’s ability to castrate kids.  Their opponent is on the ropes due to his own incompetence and their plan is to try and out-do his self-destruction.

                    Speaking of which Stephanie Stuckey is a lawyer and former Democrat member of the Georgia legislature. Right now, she’s trying to resurrect the family company, Stuckey’s, which used to have a fairly large footprint along the interstate highway system.
Stephanie seems like a nice lady, but if you look at her profile on Facebook, she calls herself the “Chair” of Stuckey’s. Not chairman, no no no! Not even chairwoman. Chair.

        “He would be worse than Bush, as people actually trusted Trump.”Right now I wonder whether anyone abroad trusts him. The Chinese don’t, the Russians don’t, and now the Iranians don’t. He talks and “negotiates” (if that’s the right word) in bad faith, and contradicts himself and flip-flops constantly. His word means nothing. They say a gentleman’s word is his bond and by this criterion Trump is no gentleman. But I’m increasingly convinced he’s not even a normal man. Rather a blithering idiot who should be put in a straitjacket and shipped off to the funny farm.As for what you’re saying concerning his thinking about China, you’re assuming he thinks in this strategic manner. But strategy is beyond his ken. He just reacts viscerally and just utters any old piece of garbage. It’s the kind of trash talk one used to hear in the WWF and WCW ring with wrestlers like Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Warrior.

            In ye olde Bible days, one of the people God saved was a king of Judah. He gave him 12 more years of life. It was all very deliberate and showy, with even a miracle involved. What the king did with those years was a)show one of the neighboring rivals the storehouses of weapons and b)sire a son who took the throne under his blessing (presumably over older, more competent sons) who was a complete disaster for the kingdom. God doesn’t always save people for immediately positive results.

            Trump said 3 or 4 things the past week that are just totally disturbing even taking into the fact that Trump says stuff. This doesn’t seem like the usual Trump A/B thing (which we literally just saw with immigration raids). Him blowing off what his DNI said with “I don’t care what she says” was just insane. So now he takes the word of Mark Levin over his own DNI? A guy who hated him until 5 minutes ago? A guy who said the same BS about Iraq, which Trump heavily criticized in 2015? It seems like all of his MAGA base is horrified by this except for X anons (bots) and newcomers like Levin and Ben Shapiro (surely just a coincidence). We do know, though, that Trump does listen to criticism so I just pray the message gets through.

He has his orders from on high is the only inference I can draw. The USA is not a sovereign state anymore. The Kosher Nostra runs everything, but using a Goy glove.

                    I say we roll with Occam’s razor and simply acknowledge that, just as Biden succumbed to dementia, Trump has gone crazy. And I mean that quite literally. He really has no idea what he said 30 minutes ago, let alone three weeks ago. This would account for his incoherence and the bizarre things he says.

                        Well, in fairness, whites have fumbled and lost the ball. I live in a region where most of the cretins one encounters are, alas, white. Overweight, foul-mouthed losers in and out of KFC with their spawn all piling into a beat-up Taurus, their aggregate weight – plus the buckets of chicken – straining the suspension of the old rusted vehicle. I am not exaggerating much. The deterioration of rural white people is real, and it cannot be blamed on other races. It can be blamed on stupidity, the collapse of families, of proper work, of religion, of general education. We’re talking about people who cannot add double digits in their head, read an analogue clock, or find their way to the nearest Walmart without a GPS,I am all for an ethnostate, but without these people.

                            Much of the deterioriation of white people stems from the New Left’s conquest of America’s institutions and fashioning them into an anti-white propaganda/indoctrination apparatus. We have been taught to loathe ourselves and to jettison everything that made us great. Those who succumbed to the great psy-op are those you’ve described as well as the spiteful mutants.

                    Yes, that’s Levin. It’s sad too, because by the standards of talk radio, Levin is thoughtful. educated, even informative.

Kind of scary. Replace “Raymond Shaw” with ((a certain small country)) and it’s the same unbreachable hypnotic state.

            There’s this weird sense of deja vu right now. We have an aged President heading into mental deterioration who is probably going to be replaced by his VP at some stage. This is Trump, not Biden. And we even have impeachment on the table once more – this time from enraged MAGA folk who quite rightly think that he has betrayed them. Bizarre times!

                The Iran issue is the “do or die” moment for the Donald. If he doesn’t get serious – fast – and extricate AINO from this deadly and pointless war between nations of no consequence to our actually-existing domestic emergencies, then I have had enough. Next election on my ballot I write in Pinochet, or Franco, Charlemagne, or Vlad the Impaler.

        Russia is currently building a rail corridor from St. Petersburg through Iran and terminating at a coastal port on the Arabian Sea. This benefits Russia by bypassing both the Baltic Sea and Black Sea transport bottlenecks. As such, Iran is now becoming an intercontinental crossroads. Neither Russia nor China is going to allow Iran to be defeated by the West. Trump will likely authorize a single strike, fail badly, as did Jimmy Carter in his Iranian misadventure, and then declare victory while slinking away. How far we have fallen.

            Railroads are not a real substitute. Shipping is so cheap nobody can even believe it, but consider that peaches grown in Brazil, packaged in Thailand and shipped back to the US, is cheaper than domestic produce. The most expensive part of that voyage is the truck that takes the peaches from the farm in Brazil to the port.

                Sorry, but you’re ignoring the reality of geopolitics. The West uses its domination of shipping corridors to enforce its economic hegemony and extract rent from all shipping activity; plus also uses that control to enforce its coercion and threats in other areas. Russian shipping, when restricted solely to the Baltic and Black Sea bottlenecks, is at the mercy of this piracy. The rail line to the Arabian Sea port undermines that hegemony and neuters the West’s transport dominance.

                    I’m not aware that the West taxes Russian shipping, and a railroad doesn’t undermine the hegemony if the cost is x50 per kilo.
Yes, you can circumvent a naval blockade, but it’s not a viable economic solution long term.

                    My example was made up and for illustration only, but that’s the order of magnitude we’re dealing with, and the only way it’s subsidized is that bunker fuel isn’t taxed.
A big reason is that the infrastructure is completely free of charge and you can load as much tonnage onto the sea as naval engineering allows, and travel any distance without putting wear on it at all.
Also it’s one area where capitalism actually works as intended: the competition is savage and the profit margins razor thin.

                            Good on you, I never buy Chinese garlic myself. It has no real kick and the aroma has more sulphur than flower.
But people buy it anyway because all they care about is price and since they usually burn off the higher notes with too hot oil, they can’t taste the difference anyway.

            The regime is what’s going away, not the nation. Maybe the principals are tired of Iran’s antics too- the Twelver’s focus on war-war and proxies while they asset-strip the nation gives Russia and China huge discounts, because the mullahs don’t have money for much else other than maintaining their police state and trying to extend it on the coast.
However, big discounts now also means the strong possibility of default in the future.  The Ayatollah is in the same position as Zelenskyy.

        I fear that someone in Israel is reading what zman is writing about Trump’s base, nodding in agreement and then proceeds to order painting f-35s with the national insignia of Iran and bombing an American ship. Or a concert is blown up and an Iranian driver’s license found nearby. With the stakes this high, is there any chance that the usual suspects will desist from dirty tricks?

Ben, heed sage advice. Put down the puns, son.
Stop going for the easy laugh and start producing something with your life. Think first, instead of living off the publication of really bad humor.
It’s time to write technical manuals, Ben. Strictly fact-based ones.

                I might (only might) finally look up just whatever the f00k Joomteemf is supposed to be about. Actually, I think we should always celebrate by just making up the most ridiculous revisionist history story about it that we can. Then, we have a big feast of fried chicken and watermelon (what else) and each person at the table tells his goofy story about what it really means. So, yeah, it’s exactly a summer version of Kwanzaa.

        You missed out the fact that Trump wouldn’t have returned to power without powerful Zionist backing and that it is very likely that he and most of political allies are being blackmailed by Israel (Epstein Island, Mr Lindsey?). Gabbard told him that the Iranians weren’t building nukes and he seemed to accept that for a moment. Then he talks to Netanyahu and jaw, jaw becomes war, war. Yes, Trump might have the brain cells left to make this all about stopping China, but the simplest explanation is that US foreign policy is decided in Tel Aviv.

        Now you are starting to think at the right level of analysis: empire and hegemony for the NATO-level oligarchs.This is why France changed her tune regarding Israel and has joined in the defense alongside Britain.Western powers were content to let China be the empire’s factory until the Chinese economic “miracle” meant another potential rival. The breakup and subjugation of Russia is sold with the same logic for them, alongside claiming trillions in Russia’s resource like the nation was some African backwater.Iran has become an important logistics hub and supplies China 20% of her oil energy. You need to regime change Iran and cut off the energy supplies in particular before making war on China. The level of chaos that would create for the Chinese economy probably cannot be understated, which makes a victory in war plausible if yet another regime change is your victory condition.The Iran war is not as risky for the NATO-level oligarchs as it is for the American people. If the empire cannot maintain hegemony, flip the board with a global economic crash, punish the Trump voters. If they cannot claim the riches of the global economic order, then burn it all down so no one else can either. The destruction and chaos is another chance to reassert dominance later, which they assume is a given.

            And, I don’t think China wants to risk a nuclear exchange with anyone either.
If the use of tactical (limited range) nukes gets normalized on the testing grounds of Iran, then, like drones or hypersonics, it changes all the rules.
Now, Joe MAGA is giving Tucker a lot of grief, but I think he’s the Emirates’ cutout sending a message to Israel: keep it conventional. Trump and Tucker are playing a bad-cop, good-cop Vince McMahon routine.

        War with China is even dumber than war with Iran.  Unless the US can totally defeat China in a very short war of maybe a couple of months, the US will be handed the worst defeat in our history and may very well end in our navy sunk and our shipyards being destroyed.  The US attacking China or fighting China on the side of Taiwan is as stupid as Hitler declaring war on the US.Our so-called allies aren’t going to do anything.  Unlike the US, Korea and Japan are in easy striking distance of China.  They are not going to risk their shipyards being destroyed by Chinese missiles.The US simply doesn’t have the productive capacity to win against China.  Every loss will be permanent on any time frame vis-a-vis a war with China.

            Another thing people forget: China was basically Japan’s “Russian front” during WW2, keeping over 1 million troops tied down who could have prevented our Pacific theater victories. China today is far more powerful than the divided and backward China of the 1930s and 1940s – more powerful, even, than the mighty Soviet Union of those days.

                    The manufacturing and industrial prowess of the USA in 1944-45, combined with its per capita productivity, is well known and shall always be the standard, much as Ted Williams batting .406 in 1941, or the Hoover Dam being built within five years.It was a different time, you understand…China is ruled by practical, cynical men. In the time it takes to get a variance allowing someone to expand their shoestore in a posh US suburb, the Chinese build another 2-3 power plants. As the Chinese add another 1000 engineers, “we” add another 1000 lawyers (many of whom are in fact Chinese).My own view is that “we” are already vassals of the emerging Chinese global empire.

                Not really.  China wants unification with Taiwan and that is the hot spot where China-US relations could go sour.Iran is unlikely to defeat the US Navy. China is likely to defeat the US Navy and possibly bomb it all the way back to US docks.We have a slight technology edge, but they can out produce us more than 10 to 1.  We could not build a carrier in a 5 year period, especially if the shipping lanes are not open from other Asian economies.  So the solution is we’re gonna have Japan and South Korea build them for us.  This is a terrible idea which makes them belligerents which means China is justified destroying their shipyards.  Neither Japan or S Korea can do anything about it.  Not to mention Xi could decide that this is the perfect opportunity to back up N Korea with weapons and supplies for her enormous military. Of course, the S Koreans and Japanese know this and so if push came to shove, that would be the end of it.

            The US simply doesn’t have the productive capacity to win against China.
China might not do so well either. According to some estimates, their actual population size is barely larger than that of the US…

                I’ve heard these rumors, just complete and utter nonsense.  While the official numbers may or may not be correct, these fake made up numbers going around on social media are impossible.  One video I saw, I think it was a woman named something Li, actually cited a viewer of a different channel who claims to work for the UN or something that he left in a comment.  WHO would cite something like this?  There is not one credible source for any of this malarkey.

I ate some watermelon after lunch. This afternoon I plan to drive around in my car blasting music with heavy base and block intersections while waiting for the light to change.

Maybe later I will steal some nail polish at Walgreens for my baby momma.

            AINO has too many critical supply chains that start in China. They don’t want to provoke an immediate shutdown of those.
Two examples that come to mind are pharmaceuticals and rare earth metals. Two subcategories impacted by the second category are magnets and integrated circuits.

                Exactly, particularly the pharmaceuticals (and literally nothing substantive changed after Covid). China also tends to be the sole source of more complex components, so you get unironic requests for material to be used in weapons scheduled to export to Ukraine, by way of example. This isn’t solely or sometimes even mainly a question of inflation–it often boils down to actual availability.

            The other hole in his thesis though is that the Iran War is wildly unpopular and they’re trying to pump Israel as the casus belli, but after a year of state sponsored genocide Americans don’t like Israel much more than they do Iran.  If the thesis is true it seems like it would be easier to sell Americans on the idea of thwarting Chinese, or even Russian influence, than defending Bibi’s bad decision making.

        I agree that China is likely the ultimate target of a war with Iran, but don’t forget Russia.  An Iranian collapse would enable globalist activity in the various central Asian republics around Russia.The Japanese strike on Pearl Harbor, and also on the Phillipines and British colonies such as Hong Kong and Singapore, was part of a complex calculation.  The Japanese had achieved victory over Russia in the 1905 war despite having occupied very little of Russia, and that in far-away Siberia.  Russia simply had to concede that certain areas (e.g., Korea) could be occupied by Japan.  Japan thought that a couple of major defeats of the Americans (and the British in Hong Kong and Singapore, and the Dutch in the Dutch East Indies) would convince the United States to simply concede to Japan certain areas in China and Indochina.  What Japan failed to take into account was the American drive (even in the 1940s) towards global heremony.

            Could we be seeing the early formation of WWIII? The Anglosphere and Western/Central Europe as the Allies and BRICS as the Axis?

                I continue to believe, and events of the past week reinforce it, that WW3 began when Russian troops entered Ukraine. Kind of like how WW2 began when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1936, but nobody was calling it WW2 yet. They weren’t calling it WW2 yet when Germany invaded Poland either.

                    There’s no single event that makes a war a war, so you can pick your favorite beginning. I think WW3 started years ago, with the UK’s “mock” invasion of Russia via Estonia in early 2017. Britain’s message to Putin: “Trump, elections, and the people can’t stop us. We’re coming.”Pearl Harbor was fake, in a sense. Made for TV, at the birth of TV. Maybe Putin’s invasion, which surprised almost everybody, was WW3’s analogous event. He invaded because we were going topretend he invaded. Made for state-run social media, at the birth of state-run social media. Putin ruined the show. We didn’t have a Plan B, and he didn’t really want to do anything, so: weird long stalemate.Now we have Plan B.

                The difference between the Great War in Two Parts and now are there are no troops in the West able to be called up. There’s also no serious willingness to pay for it. Large conventional armies require a lot of domestic cooperation. I’m sorry to say that being a soldier doesn’t sound all that much different from being in prison, except they aren’t shooting at you in the later case. If families don’t insist that young men do their duty, and those young men don’t see the need for it, don’t bother.Can it be WWIII? Sure.  But it won’t be the Great War in Two Parts except as a sad farce of itself.

                    It would be largely an air-and-naval war that could easily go nuclear. It would also prove astronomically expensive and inconclusive. The best-case scenario would be that there be no bombing of population centers, but there’s sure no guarantee of that.

                One could argue that WWIII started in the Syrian Civil War – analogous to the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, with Germans and Russians and their hardware facing off on opposite sides.

        I do not see how the US can bomb Fordow and not commit US troops. If he bombs it and it releases radiation, we will have to clean it up. We will have to send in troops to defend the clean up teams.What happens if the regime falls and the Iranians celebrate their diversity Syria style? Does the enriched radiation hit the black market and wind up in dirty bombs in the US or Europe?As you said on ramzpaul, China may decide to bleed the US and NATO by supplying Iran with weapons. They lost Syria which was a blow to their Belt &amp; Road plans. I doubt they will sit back and lose Iran.

            There’s no way we can put troops on the ground in Iran. We don’t have sufficient forces, and the pubic won’t stomach it. They won’t enlist, either.On the other hand history has proven conclusively that air power alone cannot defeat an enemy without infantry and armor on the ground as well. The Blitz on London, the 8th Air Force, Operation Rolling Thunder, Operation desert Fox… the examples are endless.So Trump has boxed himself in. If he bombs Iran, he commits an act of war and the Iranians can and will retaliate any way they see fit. But bombing Iran will not defeat it, and Trump cannot put troops on the ground.Utterly stupid…

                If regime change is the goal, and I believe it is, then most likely somebody has to go in on the ground, sooner or later. Post Iraq, the GAE way of war has repeatedly involved proxy armies. Where are all those guys who spent the last 15 years fighting in Syria?

                        This theory of pre-emptive strike is just flat out immoral. There is apossibilityat some point in thefuture, in which our adversarymayattack us. Therefore, we are justified to strike them first. It doesn’t take a philosophy major to realize the problems with this. It only makes sense when we see the nuke being fueled up on the launch pad, and we have a guy on the launcher telling us yep, they just put in the coordinates for a US city. Obviously this is not what’s occurring, so the reasoning is faulty and immoral. But it doesn’t matter they just need to convince the rubes that they’re in danger.I know what-about-ism can grow tiresome, but just picture the Iranians assassinating a bunch of Israel’s leadership a month ago. When asked what the hell they were thinking they reply- “well they were gearing up to strike us.” Oh noes! You can’t do that! It’s another Holocaust!

Steamtrunk size, actually, and ones hidden in onboard cargo containers.  Park it in the harbor, and Port Authority go bye-bye.That’s why the Baltimore Bridge had people chunking their boxers.

If we’re supposed to fear Iranian suitcase nukes so much, why not Russian suitcase nukes? North Korean suitcase nukes? Pakistani suitcase nukes? Indian suitcase nukes?
Funny how we’re supposed to worry about a nation that has no ICBMs, no SLBMs, no long range bombers, no air defenses, and a 1970s air force. Iran cannot hit us… butcanhit Israel.

            China has been sending cargo planes to Iran since the sneak attack. My guess is they are supplying Iran with components to keep building missiles as part of a war of attrition. Israel has admitted that it is low on AD already. The US is also low on AD. Another couple of weeks and things get critical.The thing is, an attack on Iran will not change this problem, unless that attack collapses the regime. That is the dilemma Trump is facing at the moment. His high risk scheme has created a scenario in which the risks are now higher. It is why there is a good chance they do not use bunker busters on Fordow, but on Iranian command structures. They try another head shot.

On top of that, one has to think an incoming bunker buster bomb could be deflected, damaged, or even destroyed by local point air defense cannons or missiles.

                The above is a good illustration as to why we can’t win squat in any war.  China sends critical components to build Iranian missiles which the Iranians use within weeks to replenish weaponry.  Meanwhile, in the US, Raytheon’s President talks of 18 months to restart an assembly line for US weaponry sent to Ukraine.

                    Both China and Russia are doing what we used to call dollar diplomacy. Except they do not just bribe the leaders. They also invest in the infrastructure.

                        China and Russia have strong presences throughout Central America too. China mostly via economic entities.For example, China built (for ‘free’) a huge soccer stadium in the capitol city of Costa Rica, and has small and large grocery stores all over the country.  Thus, a disseminated presence where Chinese nationals have nearly zero oversight from the host nation.  They’re doing more than selling tortillas, put it like that.Russia, for example, has troops and advisors stationed in Nicaragua, many at the Costa Rican border and offshore.While the threats in Central and South America mount, what concerns D.C.?

            China is already supplying weapons to Iran. Dang, sorry I don’t have the specifics.
However, I agree with one pundit that the strategy is “Drop it and bounce. We’ll take take of our demand – Fordow, no nukes (because we say so, that’s why) – and let Israel do the rest.”
Trump strong horses keeping proliferation within bounds, the Israel lobby ties itself up in looking as bad as possible. That is putting a lethal dent in their credibility and worship on the Right, the Left, and the Faithful.

        Very important and inciteful post about China and Trump’s motivations.   This goes along with what some of the military analysts have said about the conflict.   They have not noticed the China link but they are starting to say the tactics are going to be the Syria and Libya model.  The complete destruction of the Iranian society.    If Iran is turned into a Mad Max landscape with various warlords running things then they will be no threat.There are no U.S. force structures that would allow boots on the ground for the foreseeable future.  If Iran’s economy is destroyed the railway to China would be irrelevant. No?   A wild card, at least to me, is the many militia groups that Iran controls in Syria, Iraq and Iran.

            Iran’s economy is being asset-stripped anyways by the regime. If that railway was run by a more tractable regime…I can see how Russia, China, and Turkey would sign off. And, we’re setting up a ‘Kurdistan’ (Balochistan) to mess with the Pakistanis, to India’s delight. Thus the visit with Modi.MBS, investing beyond oil, would love to have a piece of Gaza Riviera. The original Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline to Iran is still there, as well, from Iran’s original deal with Israel, next to the offshore fields.Sisi smacked Obama’s Muslim Brotherhood, Turkey has its piece of Syria, Houthis are to Yemen what Palestinians are to Israel. Lebanon is prostrate.I think the big boys want peace- they have their own restive populations to suppress- and want Iran the country to stop stirring up the Bully, it puts all of them in the crosshairs.  More radical groups helps nobody.

        One would think, in a huge landmass connecting Russia, China, Iran, India and Turkey plus lesser players, that sophisticated networks of transportation, transmission lines, pipelines for oil and gas – invulnerable to interference from the AINO Navy – could easily be worked out once the main parties agree that the USA can be isolated and sidelined, with benefits for all. One country would have to call the shots and that country would presumably be China, given its wealth, military power, and well-established international reach, no small part of which is in AINO itself.The Greater Eurasian Co-Prosperty Sphere. And unlike that other Co-prosperity sphere, no danger of its military and commercial activities interdicted by sea.An enfeebled  GAE would give way to the GCE, the global Chinese Empire. An enfeebled Europe would submit itself, through poverty and helplessness, to the dictates coming from the GCE, just as it has done since 1945 with its dependence on the GAE.Z man likes to cite Thucydides, and for good reason. Like the Athenians “we” have squandered “our” military prowess on any number of Syracusan invasions leading to fiasco. For ends that make no real sense.I await our Aegospotami. A fitting end, a “sea power” destroyed by a “land power” at its own game.

            The most frightening thought: a GAE in its writhing death throes, setting off Armageddon as a kind of adolescent fit at not getting its way.

        So far the view of Trump as a facilitator of little stabilization in the Empire is losing arguments: the erratic trade disputes, immigration flip-flops, Ukraine peace fiasco and now Iran. This presidency might as well pose him as an undertaker of global hegemony, through the destruction of credibility and flailing around as if to waste energy on purpose.For all the pivoting towards Indo-Pacific, the distractions keep piling up along the way. Or perhaps the pivot has already become unrealistic in its ambitions and the signs like accepting further knowledge transfers (expanding Chinese student visas) foretell the future of resigned acceptance to some agreed scope of Chinese expansion while saving face.In the meantime the Jewish lobby tries to strip mine what’s left of its investments before the changing demographics challenge its current purchasing power.I suppose it’s more entertaining than the steady rot of his predecessor.

        The Pearl Harbor attack was a desperation move by the Japanese. The American embargo was set to cripple their military and the remedy was to seize the resources of the European colonies in Asia. FDR had assured the Portuguese (who had a small colony [Timor] in Indonesia) that in the event of a Japanese attack, the US fleet would move westward to oppose it. He knew the Japanese had broken the Portuguese diplomatic code and would get the message. Thus, the Japanese were convinced that the US Pacific fleet would need to be neutralized for Japanese offensive to succeed. It was a bluff FDR; there was no way the American people would have backed a war to rescue European empires in Asia. Yamamoto was aware that the strategy was risky and said he could guarantee only six months of victories. He was prescient.

        “If you listen to what Trump says, he is all over the map, …”Perhaps the most pathetic outcome of this whole fiasco.  Trump’s “all over the map” because he’s attempting to take credit for anything in this fiasco that can be perceived as a victory or a positive outcome.  Toss enough BS at the wall and something will stick (come true). However, not everyone is that gullible, Trump’s statements are more correctly perceived as confusion, incompetence, and lack of control.Trump has bet his entire presidency/legacy on this venture, whether he knows this or not.  If he wins—through shear luck—it’s clear sky and potential smooth sailing to the midterms.  If not, he’s a lame duck after four months in office.

            That’s a compelling conjecture, NateG. Recently others had said that if the putative Epstein Files really had any dirt on Trump that it would have been used in the past few years. Since no such Kompromat dropped, goes the argument, such Kompromat doesn’t exist. But not so fast! To my mind at least, substantially all if not all of the assaults against Trump dating back to “Rusiagate” or whatever it was before he’d even been elected (in 2016) were either total forgeries (e.g. the “Pee Dossier”) or were very (pardon the pun) trumped up charges like the conviction about putting the wrong wording on the memo of checks written to one’s attorneys. There were obviously several such attacks. My point is they were weak, even amateur, ones. The “masterminds” who concoct such partisan political attacks are not highly intelligent. Quite in contrast, I suspect that Mossad or other elements of Deep State are a bit wiser and play the long game. If they have anything really incriminating, it’s always held in reserve. Also, one needn’t be an expert to assume that such Kompromat is far more valuable if it’sneverrevealed than if it actually were divulged.

        “a railway that links China to Iran”*gasp*Zman, you’ve scored another first. I’ve never heard mention of this before, and it must’ve taken quite a bit of time and investment.
I surely would like to know what countries this railroad runs through. This is Mackinder theory come live.
And South Pars! That might constitute a direct attack on Chinese interests. Meanwhile, Federal land in the Western states are being offered up for sale to China through the back door. Are we becoming Canada’s 11th province?

        I want to add that Iran has done things that I don’t understand, that don’t make sense, outside of being a Russian and/or Chinese puppet.Iran has engaged in pointless, and costly expeditionary actions that have mostly ended in defeat: Lebanon, where Hezbollah got destroyed by Israel’s pager bomb and aerial bombs. Syria, where the IRGC got routed by ISIS jihadis. Hamas where Iran trained the jihadis to attack Israel, for ???To what benefit did Iran get by Oct 7, which was an operation conceived and trained in Iran (which is why the Israelis did not understand what was happening).Moreover, Iran has had assassinations of top nuclear scientists and other generals and technical people IN IRAN for the last ten years. Suggesting that Mossad has deeply penetrated their security services to the point where no one is safe. Yet nothing was done.Iran’s unremitting hostility to Israel makes no sense for the Regime’s objectives: stay in power, increase their power, be secure from the most nearby regional threats: Pakistan (both Iran and Pakistan have been meddling in their neighbors internal affairs). Pakistan has accused Iran of aiding the Balochi separatists in Pakistan, and Iran has accused Pakistan of aiding the Azeri separatists in Iran. Iran has a rivalry with Turkey in the Caucuses and Caspian over Azerbaijan and Armenia. [With Iran until Armenia made deals with NATO acting as a semi-protector to Armenia alongside Russia against Azerbaijan and Turkey].Then there are the Gulf Monarchies. Iran has had a constant, low-level War against Saudi, with a recent truce but not peace, over Yemen. The Yemenis have held off Saudi (and US) bombing only with the help of Iran’s expeditionary force. The targeting of the Truman by Yemenis was really the Russians, who were retaliating for the sinking of the Moscva and other stuff like the bombing of their strategic bombers.The Iranians can hit fixed targets no issues. Its a math problem, but hitting or nearly hitting a moving aircraft carrier 200 miles out to sea requires satellite real time imagery for targeting. Iran as far as I know does not have that satellite capability, Russia does. Reason enough to come to terms with Russia over Ukraine and get that capability removed.The Iranians have been picking fights with Israel for no real benefit to them for over 20 years. The US is not the only power leading smaller nations down the primrose path to destruction. I think Russia (and probably also China) have been urging them onwards just like the neo cons did with Ukraine. Its folly to think our sickness is confined to only us, the Russians and Chinese have the same issues.Meanwhile Iranian internal security is a joke. Which they have not addressed. Just like Ukraine they have not been realistic about what they can and cannot do, and just like Ukraine they have not been realistic about the amount of support and the efficacy of that support from “allies.”Likely every big power involved wants to see if cheap missiles hitting fixed targets can win out against cheap JDAM bombs from expensive air frames / pilots hitting both fixed and mobile targets. Cynically, a lab for exploring what Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines, Pearl Harbor, the Aleutians would look like in the coming war. [China wants the Pacific as a Chinese Lake, with the US as an agricultural colony. They have been very clear on this.  US elites cannot stomach that which is why Trump is President and the parties are Democrat=China; Republican=anti-China. War is pretty much inevitable, just a question of where, when, and how.]

        “He seems to worship Jewish people, a common folk religion in Washington.”Two comments:1. Maybe people in these corners of the internet wouldn’t be so hostile to Jews if we didn’t have to hear about them and they weren’t in our face all the time. Just shut up and keep your head down like other ethnic groups and maybe you won’t attract so much hate. But that’s not their way.2. I just had one of those “aha!” moments. I’ve been blaming Republican cucks for being Uncle Toms for their Jewish masters, which they are. It just hit me that Trump is also an Uncle Tom, maybe even the biggest Uncle Tom of them all.

            Like it or not, Jews are central to world history. It’s in the Bible. If you look at things from a spiritual and Biblical perspective, it all makes sense.
Another reason for my gripe with Kevin MacDonald’s “evolutionary selection” theory about Jews – and why evolution itself is pure B.S. – overnight Jews went from downtrodden shtetl mice being railroaded to death camps to Levantine super-warriors soundly beating all comers while massively outnumbered.

                The theory only makes sense in our Jewish media soaked world. They think they are the center of world history and the universe and can spread the theory far and wide. As it stands the OT is the history of the Israelites, with the tribe of Judah one of 12 (or 13 depending on who is counting). The word “Jew” (Judahite) does not appear until very late in the OT timeline. NT Judahites clearly thought of themselves as Israelites/Sons of Abraham well before their tribal association. (Ben Shapiro would be proud).Evolution even if it were true simply doesn’t work that fast anyway. It depends on millions of years to even make sense. It doesn’t really then, but that’s another essay.  If you want a theory that involves God to explain things, then God has allowed the Jews to come to power in the 20th century for His own reasons. That power appears to be unwinding in our lifetimes.

        Why has Trump not simply hit Iran’s various sites? Why the delay?My guess is he is trying to make a deal with Russia. Swap Ukraine for Iran. He wants to get out of Ukraine, which is a no win, and get some kind of a win for himself to bank against conviction in his inevitable impeachment by Speaker Jeffries. This means he needs some Neo Cons and suchlike for his side.Can it work? I don’t know. How fragile or not Iran’s leadership is, remains unknown. Bombing campaigns unseated Khadaffi, and Milosevic. Assad was unassailable as long as Russian troops were there, Ukraine caused their withdrawal mostly and he fell apart soon after.I recall after 9/11 Will Smith saying he did not care about it, as it did not involve black people. Every Rapper on Earth celebrated it with images of the WTC on fire on album covers. Most black people liked the attack. Is that the case in Iran? I don’t know, probably nobody really knows. I do know that Iranian leadership has had little confidence in their continued power as they’ve been stashing wealth outside Iran in both the US and Russia for years. As had Assad. Make of that what you will.The CIA (with Jim Cramer’s track record) holds that Iran does not have nukes nor does it seek them. So Iran most certainly already has them, how well they work, and how well they are integrated with missiles are another story.Iran is an ongoing threat to the National Security Interests of the US, and has been since 1979. Since 1944, US policy has been to provide security for the Sunni Gulf Monarchies and said regimes pump oil cheaply. That has mostly held. It was formalized with the Carter Doctrine, stating that the US will be the dominant power in the Gulf. Obama particularly in his second term abrogated that Doctrine, allowing Iran to send drones and missiles into Saudi refineries from not just Yemen but Iran without consequences other than pallets of cash. I will note that AOC, Tim Kaine, Hakeem Jeffries, the Squad, Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Bernie Sanders, and Alex Soros have all come out squarely against Israel and for Iran. While also being 100% against anything like Reagan bombing and sinking the Iranian Navy in 1988 in retaliation for blockading the Straits of Hormuz and nearly sinking a Navy ship.Trump no doubt remembers that.Israel is basically the sugar to make the US public swallow the otherwise repulsive medicine of the Monarchical regimes in the Gulf upon whom cheap oil depends. There are other places with more reserves, and other places with cheaper oil to pump out, but no where else in the quantity of both. This is why the Carter Doctrine exists.If a deal with Russia can be achieved, swapping Ukraine for Iran, it would not be the worst thing in the world. The US can bomb the place, as a laboratory for determining how to work against cheap missiles with cheap JDAM and other “smart enhanced” bombs in stand off stuff. This has been done before: Operation Desert Fox against Saddam in 1998. Nothing happened.Lastly, I am so upset this is happening during High Holy Pride Month. Pride Month people! Its both Juneteenth and Pride Month! I expect to see black transgender people on my TV all day, and instead I only get bombing footage. During Pride Month and Juneteenth?

        “when they are holding their own” I don’t see that, and I’ve been looking for it. I see Iran’s air defense, which is supposedly the best the Russians had to offer, being ineffective against the F-35A. I see, including people that I would consider “on my side” here, a mistaken extrapolation that the seriously outdated equipment supplied to Ukraine being destroyed by the Russians is a sign of American military equipment being past its due date. Destroying outdated F-16s with stripped down 40 year old avionics never impressed me. We were never going to give the Ukrainians the good stuff. My concern is that the usual suspects take the success of American military equipment as sign to push even harder. I can be convinced otherwise on all points, but I’m going to have to see something better than some poorly done AI.

What attracts people to the “Alt-Right” world, is, or should be, realism. Race realism, sexes realism, economic realism. Accepting the world as it is and not how you want it to be. Trying to rationalize a position based on wishful thinking that the MIC has inferior equipment is not realism. Like I said, given enough evidence to the contrary, my opinion can change but I have yet to see that evidence.

            I think you’re buying into the propaganda a bit Friendo. We are all susceptible to confirmation bias, but you can be sure you’re not getting accurate reports from either side. Such is war. I think “our type” should be more level-headed. You are correct in that sometimes our high-tech equipment is assumed to not work because we want to dump on the MIC. Sometimes it does work wonderfully, but as a lifetime student of war I can tell you a lesson learned over and over again is war is a contest of will and an over-reliance on high tech usually just gives the owner a misplaced confidence. Sometimes it buys you short term tactical advantage, but in the big picture the side who is willing to suffer and carry on can over come high tech.

            I don’t know the specifics, but (presumably) low-tech outdated (even at the time) Soviet stuff was sufficient to down one of our vaunted Stealth fighters during the civil war in Bosnia ~ 1995.  The recovered jet was quite a prize for Russia. This was quite a big deal at the time, apparently to the extent that US/NATO “accidentally” bombed the Chinese embassy in [city?] because they suspected the goods might have been there. As I say, I don’t know the details. Lucky shot, maybe.

                Read article years ago dissecting how the Jugs did it. Wasn’t a lucky shot. Combination of determination, technical skill and imagination in putting near obsolete Soviet air defence kit to work doing something new (stealth aircraft detection and tracking), and (but of course) Good Old American Hubris. Because they were so sure they were invisible, they had a standard modus operandi around going in and out on missions…
Jugs figured out roughly the routes, worked out what other aircraft were up monitoring and what comms traffic occurred whenever a stealth mission was on, and set up the trap.

            Upvote to McLeod, for what little that’s worth.  I thought someone here mentioned the October 2024 feint or test run by Israeli jets, which activated Iran’s full air defense for livemapping.  That, combined with US satellites and Israel’s targeting of military and air assets on the ground seems to be what is doing the job, not the Air Force’s latest boondoggle.

        I am sometimes shocked by your naivete about Islam. The nice Muslims you know are not representative, nor do they drive the actions of Islamic countries.Because the mullahs follow strict Islam (which is much more a political system than a religion), so long as the mullahs are in charge Iran will never hold to any deal. Taqiyya is not just hiding one’s religion when threatened, it is also deceiving the infidels to gain an advantage, and this behavior is =mandated= by the Noble Quran. “War is deceit.”Further, Islam is =by definition= at war with all the lands of the Infidel, and tends to state what must be done by what is not. So a fatwa against nuclear weapons doesn’t mean what you think. Rather, it means that once the Infidel is conquered and subdued, there will be no need to use nukes. Until then, nukes are fine. It was, by Islam’s lights, a declaration that Iran did indeed intend to use nukes. (Even if one assumes it was not taqiyya.)One suspects someone, or some event behind the scenes, reminded Trump of this. He is aware (after when the subject came up he did quote “You knew I was a snake before you took me in”) but he tries to believe the best of everyone until proven otherwise.Also, has everyone forgotten that last October, Iran lobbed ~500 missiles into Israel? What Israel did was merely retaliation, not a fresh attack out of the blue.The Arab nations have learned the hard way not to attack the little porcupine, despite that hating and annihilating the Jews is another of Islam’s strictest mandates. Iran, not being right next door, has not learned this lesson. It is presently being taught, but probably won’t “take” until Iran returns to a more Persian form of government.“Fight those who believe not in Allah and the Last Day and do not forbid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, and do not practice the religion of truth, even if they are of the People of the Book  until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued.” (Quran 9:29)“The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdullah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.” (Sahih Muslim, 41:6985. Note that in Islam, hadiths have the force of law.)

Liar.  That was a retaliatory strike for Israel’s previous attack.  Are you gonna start whining about the hospital next?
Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is just another enemy.  I couldn’t care less about Muslims and I don’t want a nice Muslim for a neighbor and I don’t care about Israel or Jews.  Both of them are just another group of foreigners wrecking our countries.

        Over the past six months there has been a biased glitch in the columns by The Z man. Sometimes obvious and sometimes subtle. For instance , in today’s column he uses the term “sneak attack”.A word that implies cowardice. He could have used the word “retaliation” but his bias said no. My agreements with Zman have become fewer and fewer.He is oozing the traits of the democrat mouthpiece James Carville….ie…whatever is muttered is to be just the opposite of what I said yesterday.A pity.

            “…in today’s column he uses the term “sneak attack”…”Perhaps instead we should re-open the discussion about the Six Day War of 1967. The narrative is that that sneak attack was justified because one country said another was ‘planning to attack’ …… in light of our newfound awareness of the depth and breadth of propaganda, and the attack, and goal of the attack on the USS Liberty … a logical men these events need to be revisited.After agreeing to peace in March 1940, Stalin planned one more bombing of Helsinki to teach Finland a lesson. The Finns reportedly put searchlights outside of city limits to draw the enemy aircraft away from their capital — was THIS worthy of ‘sneak attack’ in the sense that negotiations between nations were at a point where a sudden attack — was not anticipated?And thus sneaky, underhanded.

Bollocks. It was cowardly and underhanded and the Jooz specialize in this. If the Iranians had done the same to the Israelis, Western media would be frothing at the mouth and expostulating hatred and invective at the Iranians for this cowardly underhanded trick. Double standards.
And no, what the Israelis did was not retaliation. The Iranians have been minding their own business.

                    “the Gaza massacre on Israel”Ah yes, the Gaza Massacre. Another trick of the Zionist-controlled media: strip historical context out, and present anything done by the Palestinians/Iranians/Arabs as coming out of the blue and completely unprovoked and irrational. The Israelis were quietly and peacefully minding their own business when the bloodthirsty Palestinians, screaming “Allah-u-Akbar”, started their massacre of innocent Israeli women and children.What are you doing here, pal? There are enough sites and blogs for the likes of you. I thought this was a quiet oasis where we don’t have to put up with this kind of garbage. Is this blog too, alas, being infiltrated?

Postscript: Though you do definitely sound like a shill. Funny how they come crawling out of the woodwork where Israel is concerned.

                        It feels like some people had been stuck in the internet of 20 years ago and all of a sudden they freed them into the internet of today. I wonder if they feel that way too?

            I asked a neo-con boomer to explain how the Israeli sneak attack and the Japanese attack were any different.  He had nothing.
