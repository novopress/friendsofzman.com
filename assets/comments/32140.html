        Funny how, for all the negrolatry in show business, they keep setting stories in white contexts. If it’s diversity you want, why not make a set of violent action films about Tutsis vs. Hutus? Lots of diversity there. I just can’t imagine why they wouldn’t. No sir. No idea.

            There was a movie called The Woman King that did that. They ran into a little problem of trying to make the French the bad guys when they were trying to end the slave trade the protagonist of the movie was deeply involved in..

            I’ve not seen any movies on Rwanda, but there are documentaries where Whitey is the bad guy and largely responsible for the mass slaughtering.  I’m not even joking.  Either the UN failed to intervene, which is whitey’s fault.  Or the roots of hatred between the tribes is due to whitey’s favoritism during colonial times.  Everything bad that happens in the world is whitey’s fault.

                Years ago I had an online conversation with Rwandan seminarian in England who was going on about social justice or something and I asked him about the inter-tribal slaughter. His response was that it was caused by, and I quote, “faulty evangelization” by the Europeans.
You can baptize ’em and bring ’em to Oxford but they’re still SubSaharan primitives who lack any capacity for self-reflection.

            What they’re doing is a form of punishment for whitey, I believe. Setting films in blackest Africa or blackest Chicongo just isn’t quite the gut-punch that blackening 1970s Ireland–or Shakespeare or medieval Germany–is. Witnessing our civilization and culture slowly being colonized by Afro-savages is demoralizing, and that’s the point.
If I had a rocket launcher…

Or worse.  The old playbook is, “marginalize, demonize, destroy”.  In that order.Well, we know we’ve been/being marginalized via “DIE”, now comes/add demonizing.  Let the demographics play out for another generation of “demonizing” and you’re read for step three.

                    True, with the proviso that they’ve been demonizing us since at least the 1980s. Most scholarly monographs in the social sciences/humanities published after 1970 and especially after 1980 are morality plays featuring Blue-eyed Ice Devils and saintly indigenes. For people who claim to be so sophisticated these scholars have a nursery school-level understanding of how the world worked and works.

Still too damn nice, Ostei.  Remember, half or more of these “scholars” are Black, low IQ, mediocrities granted a faux degree and hired back in the system that produced them for virtue signaling purposes. The proverbial “self-licking ice cream cone”. The other, mostly non-minority, “scholars” are midwit ideologues grifting the system.
To state “nursery school-level understanding”, or just plain “understanding” is to imply a level of intellect and effort not in evidence even at that level.

                    When does this “end of day” come, perchance? Because I’ve been listening to smart men tell me to calm down for over four decades now, that “the market will prevail.”
Now those men are all dead or senile, and my country is destroyed. But you keep looking for that sunset, fella.
Perhaps before the sun sets the thought might occur to you that moneyisbeing made (no matter your advanced degree of financial acumen) and you’re simply unable to figure out how, why, and where it’s going.

                        I didn’t say anything about markets, which is a completely different concept than the competitive marketplace. I just said that they care about making money and they are getting pinched right now because they’re producing a lot of crap that nobody wants to watch. I don’t want to watch a cornucopia of humanity on my TV or movie screen. They made their bed.

                    I’d like to agree (and I do, regarding closing of theatres) but someday watch who it is that gives theatres their patronage. The industry couldn’t care less about us — we aren’t the ones buying $20 tickets and $15 popcorn. They are going for the young.
That’s why we can’t just leave it to “the market”. Though I’m also at a loss for what to do about it other than take a page from CSNY. Teach your children well.

                    They make money on some, lose on others.  There is also the merchandizing (almost all of the children’s cartoon features and many of the super hero action movies are basically long commercials).  The worse of the woke ones that bomb are simply loss leaders.  You can afford to lose a couple 100 million here or there when you are banking billions on the rest.  Just look at the NBA/WNBA fiasco.

            There is a fine movie about that calledHotel Rwanda, with Don Cheadle and Nick Nolte among others, released in 2005. Much likeThe Killing Fields, it shows us the horror unleashed by fanaticism in one country; unlike the latter film (which as I recall managed somehow to blame Nixon for the rise of the Khmer Rouge), it makes no attempt to shift the blame to whites, or colonialism, or any of that. I recommend it without reservation.

                Never saw that because I just don’t care very much about negroes killing negroes in a negro country on the other side of the world.
What I do know about the actual events is that it was widely “spun.” The majority Hutu were ruled by minority Tutsis and were legitimately sick of it, so they revolted. Now, decades after the dust has settled … majority Hutus are still ruled by minority Tutsis — so much for that “every people has a right to self-determination” thing I sometimes hear people blather about.

                    Never saw that because I just don’t care very much about negroes killing negroes in a negro country on the other side of the world.Yeah, but white guys killing negroes on the other side of the world,en masse, does give one a bit of a woody. Who can’t love that scene inBlack Hawk Downwhen the “skinnies” on the Mogadishu rooftops get mowed down by helicopters sporting M134 machine guns? For that matter, for old movie buffs, the piles of dead “fuzzy wuzzies” inZulu(Michael Caine’s first starring role, I think) or in Alexander Korda’s amazing, epicThe Four Feathersof 1939, can’t fail to remind us of our warrior predecessors and what we have lost…  My wife and I watched that recently and she was upset with me when I said wistfully, “ah, when the white man bestrode the Earth like a colossus…”

                        Of course when I called June “Anal Love Month” she laughed, but immediately corrected herself. Don’t understand her. She loves sending me hard right, pro-Trump memes during the day, but gets nervous when I just say what we both know to be true. Maybe the fact that she works in a public school explains it. Meanwhile, here in our “lovely, historic, picturesque community”, the “Christian” churches have settled so many Afghans – many of whom can’t speak any English – that I am contemplating a “Christian” appeal: Time to build a mosque for our “new neighbors”. It’s the right – Christian – thing to do!It’s who we are!

                            Yechhhh. I haven’t seen any Afghans being resettled in Middle Tennessee, thank goodness, but a Coptic (Egyptian) Orthodox Church took over an underused 1950s Church of Christ building last year. The place is jumping five days a week, parking lot is full, even overflowing onto front yard next door, and this development is having a salutory effect on goings-on at the mosque a mile or two away. The Copts are an ancient branch of Christianity and are much abused in their former homeland.Speaking of “who we are,” I saw a photo a few days ago  welcoming LGBTQ Pride Month (June) by sending strong rainbow-colored light beams streaming down around the high altar at the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Upper Manhattan, just north of Columbia U and bordering Harlem. A whole month of this $#!^ is more than I can stand. However, the jokes on them as the light rays were straight;-)

        Although cinema has always been propaganda, many good movies were made throughout the 20th century.  Even as late as the 1990s, it was still possible to find films where the propaganda was veiled enough that it didn’t ruin my enjoyment of the film.  Around 2005, however, films started becoming unwatchable because of the diversity and girl boss stuff, and it has only gotten worse since then.  Some of it is because the audience has gotten dumber, so the propaganda has to be less subtle so the audience understands what they’re supposed to believe.  The main reason, however, is the increasing fanaticism of the people in the industry, which has only grown more extreme as our society lurches ever more leftward.  I rarely watch movies made after 2005 for this reason.  It’s best not to waste one’s time on this garbage.

            The propaganda is now so bad it almost doesn’t qualify as propaganda. I saw a banner ad for a new slice of Disney dreck called “The Young Woman and The Sea.”  The key art is a headshot of that carny trash female Luke Skywalker, but wearing swimming goggles as she looks out over the stormy ocean.So we need no further information to get the message. Piss on the work of an old white man, Hemingway: check. Turn main character into stronk fierce girlboss: check. Moral of story, girlboss is so tough she can defeat the power of an entire tempest with her mad swimmink skillz.It’s all so tiresome.

            I howled with laughter and snorted derisively through watching the black version of Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility. The above commenter has it right though, if it were all black no one would watch it, and at this point, if there is any hint of diversity, I simply don’t watch, I have enough books and heritage DVD’s (The ones that were released way back when before POC being to be reinserted into current releases.)

                Re: heritage DVDs, my husband and I annually go through our copies of the BBC’s Miss Marple (with Joan Hickson) and Hercule Poirot (with David Suchet) mysteries. (Though only up to 1996; when they resumed the adaptations in the 2000s they weren’t as good.)  What lovely, straightforward adaptations those were, and the Miss Marples especially portrayed a most charming view of English village life in the early 20th century.  No blacks incongruously inserted into the countryside; they only appeared when Miss Marple took a Caribbean holiday, where their presence was as natural as it would have been UNnatural in St. Mary Meade.  It makes me ache a little bit, looking at that long-ago landscape. Who thought that this needed to be “improved” by injections of aliens and perverts?

                        I’m a big fan of the Endeavor series as it was set in England during the time I lived there. Besides being fine drama, it reflected the changes in society occurring at that period in history. Despite the turbulence of the times, life there and here were downright civilized compared to today’s world.

                        Funny thing about the Endeavor-Morse-Lewis arc.  In Endeavor (set 60’s-70’s, filmed 2012-2023) there are tons of blacks in Oxford, even a main character interracial relationship.  Then during Morse (80’s-90’s) all the blacks disappear for some reason.  Then with Lewis (2006-2015) they start coming back.
What’s up with Oxford, I wonder?

                Same here. Last week I made the mistake of watching the CBS News. There was some “Asian” woman anchoring, probably Paki or something like that. She wasn’t horrible looking, but I just didn’t want to watch her. And it was specifically because she was Paki.
Just like the blacks have BET and Bounce, I guess we’re going to have to start having white channels as well. The leftists made their bed with all of this immigration and diversity. Sucks that you’re wealth just dried up because of it. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch of people.

                    Thankfully, I don’t watch sportsball, but I get exposed to the odd clip of it here and there.  They actually have women doing play-by-play now.  Empowered, manly women.  It’s as horrible as it sounds.

            I think you hit on something here that isn’t discussed or grasped enough as a whole, interconnected concept.
The point of education, to the propagandist, is only to bring people to the level that they can consume propagandist schlock. Any education or intelligence above that is an unnecessary risk.
Yes, the general public at large is dumber now and education standards are in free fall. It makes the propaganda more effective and easier to produce from the propagandist side. But, anyone with two firing neurons can see outright or at least sense the preaching, conniving, and deceit in it all.

            Modern films and TV are unwatchable, IMHO. Even when a film is not loaded up with diversity or girl bosses, there is nearly always something that makes it unwatchable, at least by me.So I watch older stuff, like much older stuff, mostly in B&amp;W.  It was there. It wasn’t in every film or as in your face (most of the time), but the propaganda was there.  Hollywood has always been way to the left of the American public.  In the 1950s there were all the communists in Hollywood, whereas communism was never anything more than a fringe movement in the US.

                “Oppenheimer” was pretty decent, apart from its hick portrayal of Truman. And the “bad guy” played by Robert Downey Junior seems to have been an Irving Berlin-type Jewish American patriot who hated commies and thought Oppenheimer was one.

                One of the more amusing “in your face” productions of the war wasThe North Starin 1943, written by none other than Lillian Hellman. It portrays the happy Soviet peoples of Ukraine innocently going about their happy and carefree lives on the collective farm when savagely attacked by the Nazi beasts. IMDb tells us that Wheels himself urged the making of this film. Last I knew it was on YouTube, and it shouldn’t be missed. It’s fucking hilarious. Stalin himself probably thought it was laying it on a bit thick. Hellman, of course, was a hardcore communist, and one of the leading screenwriters of the era.That said, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hollywood did produce some kick-ass anti-communist films. My favorite isPickup on South Street(1953) with Richard Widmark and Jean Peters (a total babe, btw); a couple others that come to mind would beThe Iron Curtain(1948) andAssignment – Paris!(1952), both starring Dana Andrews.Diplomatic Courier(1952), with Tyrone Power, is also worth a watch. Oh, and you can’t go wrong watchingThe Thief(1952), starring Ray Milland; spoiler alert: one can memorize the dialogue of this picture in one go… There were some anti-communist comedies as well; no film buff should missNinotchka(1939) orOne Two Three(1961), the latter being James Cagney’s last film.**It is tempting to note that the time in which these pictures appeared coincide with the un-American Activities congressional hearings, and to surmise that the Hollywood bigwigs needed to generate low-budget anti-communist pictures – fast – to cover their footprints. I’m only going on memory here, but I can’t think of an overt anti-communist film after 1953. McCarthy went down in 1954, didn’t he?One does marvel at the scarcity of movies about the red terror, the show trials and the gulags, though. Hmm. There isComing Out of the Ice(1982), with John Savage and Willy Nelson (!), which is excellent; there is the 1970 film adaptation ofDay in the Life of Ivan Denisovichwith Tom Courtenay; and speaking of Courtenay, we also haveDoctor Zhivago(1965), in which he plays Strelnikov, the revolutionary.Knight Without Armoris another early one, with Robert Donat (one of my favorite actors) and Marlene Dietrich. It is set in the Red Terror and quite brutal in its depiction of the Bolsheviks; it was released in 1937.**Cool fact. A small role is played by the same guy who was the Soviet ambassador inDoctor Stangelove. He looks exactly the same, like he didn’t age in 27 years!**Whoops, technically untrue. He did a cameo many years later inRagtime.

TCM shows this movie at least 1-2 times/yr.  And you’re right – it is hilarious. Dana Andrews stars in this one, too. There’s a syrupy, yet catchy little song near the beginning as the village bravely marches off to face (retreat from?) the naughty nazis.

                        So for fun I am watching this movie right now; yeah its on Youtube. Oh, check this out: Aaron Copeland wrote the score. Who could have guessed? Lefty homosexual who hated America even as he wrote admittedly delightful light American classical music such asAppalachian Spring; he applied the same “idyllic” touch to the score for this movie. Aram Khachaturian wroteHymn to Stalinin the purge era, and I don’t blame him, but fucking Copeland?
Now, for a serious re-evalutaion of Copeland music, consider ELP’s rendition of ‘Fanfare for the Common Man’.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2zurZig4L8

                    I’ll have to watch that one; my favourite Hollywood film boosting Stalin’s USSR is ‘Mission to Moscow’ (1943), based on the memoirs of FDR’s ambassador to Moscow in the 1930s. It’s absolutely hilarious, in a way you’d think would be impossible to pull off. When the ambassador witnesses the notorious show trials, he just shakes his head at how those nasty people could have sunk so low as to betray Comrade Stalin. There’s on scene where they’re going to have a conference at the embassy, and a nervous staffer worries that the place might be bugged. The ambassador blandly asserts that they have nothing to worry about, as they’d never say anything they wouldn’t be happy to say to Stalin himself. His wife compliments Madame Molotov on her line of perfumes, declaring they’re as good as or better than anything you could get in Paris.

                There’s some good stuff in there, especially the hour long films popular in the 1930s.  I don’t know if they fell out of favor, were pushed aside by the cartoons or if there were just as many in the 40s, but they don’t end up on youtube.  I’m pretty sure they were matinee fodder in the 30s.My parents were kids in the 40s and early 50s (Silent) and they used to tell me how they would go to the Saturday matinee and watch cartoons all afternoon for a nickel, especially in the summer because it had air conditioning and few people had air conditioning in their homes.  I don’t know if these cartoon matinees were responsible for the end of the short film or not.

                    There’s some, but let’s not forget the British takeover of Hollywood in 1940 to push the war.In the 1990s Sam Francis or Lew Rockwell wrote about this for Chronicles. I can’t locate it, but the list of British intelligence officers in Hollywood writing scripts for the US public was extensive.It’s always been a weapon. There are decent movies from that era, to be sure, but I watch them with the same gimlet eye I do today’s films.Great example of this is “Best Years of Our Lives,” when the vet with no arms (prosthetic hooks) is eating at a lunch counter. Guy in a hat playing the role of Evil Isolationist/America First tells the kid he lost his arms for nothing. Isolationist Man is told to leave before he ends up the same way.

                The question is what the propaganda is pushing. Film noir often had questionable themes, but there was a lot of pro-America slant back when that represented a good thing in people’s minds, whether or not it accurately reflected what America really was.
John Wayne, for instance, though with several glaring counter-examples. Regardless, he turned down all kinds of roles because he objected to the ideology that was being pushed, or that he perceived being pushed. He even turned down roles where he thought that the language was too coarse.

                    I like Wayne’s westerns. I do not like his war films, particularly “Ballad of the Green Berets.” I think he’d be a neocon today, to be honest. He had the service record to qualify as one, anyway.

                        “The Ballad of the Green Berets” was a song by Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler. It reached No. 1 for five weeks on Billboards Hot 100 in 1966.The movie, “The Green Berets,” portrayed, accurately, the versatility of the men, and, specifically, the strategic mission focus of the US Special Forces, foreign internal defense and guerrilla warfare. It was intended to counter the prevailing liberal media hype of the day that cast these soldiers as snake-eating, baby-killing mercenaries.As a retired member of a Special Forces A-Team, the back-slapping message of the film to the media of the era (the smug George Beckworth, played by David Janssen) overshadowed any creative flaw in the production.

        since my wife and I can’t stomach anything new, we watch old shows, mostly documentaries.  We’ve been watching the Sopranos since I never really watched it when it came out 25 years ago.  What’s interesting is how you can clearly see that the culture back then is like a foreign planet.  We find ourselves pausing the show and remarking to each other how we can’t believe they still allow people to watch it.  So many stereotypes that we all know to be true are present.  There was one scene where Tony explains to his daughter that it’s a fact that blacks commit all of the violent crime and theft.  We may take it for granted that all of the main characters are White and Italian because it makes sense, but imagine the show being remade today.  Most of Tony’s crew would be outsmarted by girl boss wives, all of his enforcers would be black super heroes and his children would be transgender monsters.

            Even better is the scene when Tony’s daughter has a half-black, half-Jewish boy from college over to the house.  When he gets a moment alone with the twerp, Tony lets him know that his black associates don’t want his son with their daughters and he doesn’t want their sons with his daughter.
Every normal father watching that scene nods along knowingly.

            Tony is very much like Archie Bunker. The character was created for something you could rail against. “Look at how backwards and ignorant he is, how violent”. And like Archie, he became an anti-hero and loved by fans. Both were saying unvarnished truths that are as plain as day to those who haven’t bee sipping poison for several decades.As pointed out in other threads, the audience is so dim-witted now you cannot even put this level of nuance on a character. It is all cardboard cutouts now so the 80 IQ proles can easily identify “good and bad”. For diversity this has always been required but the amount of White kids that are absolute brainlets is what is most alarming. They are well and truly stupid and know -nothing- about anything. Tiktok and Social Media plus utter lack of education &amp; indoctrination working about as well as you’d expect.

                The only difference is that Tony Soprano wasn’t portrayed as a buffoon and troglodyte, like Archie Bunker was. With Bunker, the joke was always on those who found wisdom in his words.  It’s a little more nuanced with Tony Soprano.
He had an IQ of 136.  It’s been tested.

        The next recession is going to last a long time. One reason why is that there will be (already is) too much dieversity in corporate AINO for there to be enough competency to dig out of it. And it will not be permitted, or even thinkable to most people, to point to it as the problem. So it will go on and on. As the recession continues, more dieversity will be hired, more Whites retired. Snowballing on itself. As a poster here said the other day, when you go brown, you stay down.

            It’s going to sound something like “creative destruction”, but in every recession is an opportunity. In this case, I agree the corporatocracy has too much DIE dross to make it through hard times, let alone shine. But that means anyone who does not embrace that lunacy has a huge leg up.
It’s really our choice. Are the new entrepreneurs ending that recession going to be white or not?

                Only privately owned companies can buck the dieversity, all others are legally required to destroy themselves with it, and this is only increasing, the law growing only more comprehensive, so I’m not real optimistic about the private ones.

                A lot of White guys will get rich by just pitching their services to mega-corps that actually need some crucial thing to actually work and keep working. It won’t be that hard. Just a simple company photo with a bunch of older White guys and perhaps a pickup truck in the background off in the distance (we didn’t know it was in frame, I swear!). There will be a few key people in management that can read this not too subtle sign language.I actually suspect that a lot of the outsourcing is just an attempt to dodge the American woke hiring scene. The problem is that the main country that benefits from this (India) is populated by incompetents and a few really smart guys who are also super corrupt.

        It gets more serious when it shows up in daily life. I have encounters with Africans all the time now. I thought I was moving to a whitetopia three years ago but no. At one time the population of this state was about 3% black iirc and that was in one tiny area in Denver but now the latest I heard it’s about 10% and they’re everywhere. They’re moving in from out of state because this state is a mirror of the upper Midwestern “nice” culture. They figure it’s gibs for the taking. I won’t go into the details of my encounters with these self-important pretentious entitled destructive pricks but if you’re in this situation, practice playing stupid is the best advice I can offer. But that’s just me. Going all Rambo I can’t advise but ymmv.

        I watched that movie this last weekend, and thought the out of place negro was the dumbest thing I’ve seen. 3/4 of my grandparents came from the motherland there. You’d sooner see a ghost or banshee floating around rural Ireland before you’d see a fiddle playing african. It beggars belief.I saw another one that was nearly as dumb. Leah, Lea? Something or other. A blonde wall crasher heads out to rural N Dakota to teach English in 1984. She starts paling around with the wise latina coworker/barfly. as if. But even dumber? The sassy, sooper smart teen black girl, who happens to be the only one in her group with a car.I came of age in the DC area (northern Va) in that era. I didn’t live in a wealthy suburb, it was more middle/working class. At my high school, I think there were less than half a dozen blacks, all in. None of them stood out. Most were football players.That sort of concept is seen in commercials all the time – Light skinned, white featured, in charge millenial black woman with her husband and kids. I live in a diverse city, and I rarely see anything like that. I think in my neighborhood there are two intact black families in houses. Plenty of negroes around, not many like in the commercials though.

        Recently, as I was walking on a street in a small rural town in a very remote part of Europe, I noticed a large poster in the window of the local pharmacy. It featured a white woman and a simian looking black guy with vitiligo all over his face. I though to myself that whoever created this poster wallows in ugliness. Then I looked away as I continued my walk and realized that the street is full of Indian males.

        Sometimes the requirements for racial diversity becomes unintentional comedy. I remember watching Rocky Balboa in the theatres. There was a scene where Rocky encounters a woman who gave him a hard time in the original movie, and learns she’s a single mother. It panned to the kid, who is mulatto, and the audience groaned with laughter.

        Would the “entertainment” industry have gone tits up even without DIE? I think so. DIE is more a symptom than a cause in this narrow instance. The same idiocy that propels ham-handed DIE would not allow for intelligent or at least entertaining content.  Before DIE started to do its damage, big budget films started to be remakes, sequels and reimaginations of old television series. The stupidity predates DIE, which may be its apex but is a predictable endpoint of a trend. The colorized and blackwashed vapidity simply imposes the zeitgeist on a failing and retarded industry.

        Diversity is the new racket basically as Z alluded to. Instead of the Mafia you have basically the Diversity Mafia now in charge of -everything- compliments of the (((cultural programmers))) and the pervasive white guilt they have been carefully packaging and selling for generations. The fact that so many New England protestants are natural busybodies and ‘righters of moral wrongs’ was just easy grease on the skids to slide this mind virus in place.Be certain that those who have been cooking this cult for decades took notes about abolitionists, church ladies, moral scolds and the like and found a clever way to weaponize that genetic defect against their own people.So the Diversity Mafia is not ‘Big Tony and Jimmy Whispers’ coming around to threaten small businesses or bust our your joint in the dead of night. No this mafia has the full backing of the Federal and State bureaucracy and they are just as heavily armed as the mafia ever was. Totally legal extortion compliments of you know who.Want do get some federal, state or local government contracts? You -must- carve out part of your business for diversity or you will be immediately disqualified. Many large lucrative contracts you now cannot even bid on AT ALL if you are “diverse”. The prima facia definition of racial discrimination yet it happens nationwide in any number of government contracting vehicles to the tune of billions of dollar.Go Google diversity consulting firms, diversity suppliers, etc. There is a multi-billion dollar grift out there now that ain’t goinganywherebecause it has the full force and backing of the government. These are licensed mafia rackets basically. You phone them up and say you are looking for some government contract work, want to make a game, a movie, whatever. They will “help you out” by offering a diverse supplier base and put some spit shine on your offer with lots of Newspeak Catchphrases regarding how you are a strong DEI proponent.You could say they are making you “an offer you can’t refuse”, literally, because you will be disqualified from any government work without dragging along these ticks &amp; leeches with you. It is well known in government contracting now that you are basically paying the ‘diversity tax’ by simply getting these companies involved and handing them free money for effectively doing nothing.

        This is why I no longer watch new movies or TV shows; nothing made after 2000, pretty much.  There are stories coming out now about the death of cinema, and how the ongoing failure of Hollywood is more than just a temporary downturn. I recognize my own part in that downturn, but then I thought about what it would take to get me to go out to a movie theatre, and I realized that there’s nothing. Most of the films coming out now are lame remakes of things I saw or heard about when I was young. Any new stuff is 90% girlboss superhero fantasies, which bore me stiff. As for what really DOES interest me, which is adaptations of classic literature, I couldn’t trust any filmmaker today not to screw it up with stray Africans and homosexuals, so I refuse to even try these offerings, preferring not to raise my blood pressure.

        The whole thing has been stood on its head. Elvis, The Beatles and the Stones reinterpreted (with commercial and artistic success) black culture for white audiences. Whites were inhabiting black space because blacks had cultural creations worth imitating in those days. Chet Baker, Stan Getz and Bossa Nova followed a similar path in Jazz.
Today, black culture has degenerated to the point wherein it has stopped creating any culture whatsoever. So they can either intrude on White cultural space or be invisible. Sports is the obvious exception.

                    Nowhere is this truer than in academia, where every sliver of the civilized fraction of negrodom is Hoovered up by the unis. White college students thereby get a charicatured picture of negroes.
I will say this, however. Universities, particularly teriary and quaternary ones, are getting so desperate for negroes that they are having to dip into the lower depths of the hood to fulfil their often self-imposed quotas. Consequently, walking across campus these days feels increasingly like walking through East St. Louis or Bed-Stuy.

                I haven’t watched any TV for a long time, but even 20 years ago the only place you could see black people acting normal (for them) on television was on late-night BET, during the ghetto commercials and dirty music videos right before the morning Christian shows.
I assume that stuff got put away circa Obama.

            I’d posit there hasn’t been one thing blacks have brought to the table that we couldn’t have lived without – nada.  Outside of some entertainment (which would be just fine w/o them as well), as a group they aren’t worth a damn – just a YUGE net negative on any society they happen to infest.  The proverbial turd in the punch bowl.

        A great 100% non-diverse Irish film is “Waking Ned Devine”.  Released in 1997/98 just before diversity began overtaking motion pics. No black leprechauns, no girl bosses, no transmutants.  Highly recommended.

        It’s all so ridiculous, and it’s been going on a long time. For instance, yesterday I watched a Price Is Right rerun from 1975. And, wouldn’t you know it, one of the showcases was a salute to Jackie Robinson complete with a video highlight of the spotless negro getting a game-winning hit for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1956 World Series. The woman who bid on the showcase (coincidentally?) was a Hutessa from North Carolina.
This woke idiocy didn’t just crop up in 2020, my fellow dissidents.

        I wrote about this on this post the other day and people seemed to like what I had to say about it.https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=32128It could be that this is just an accident of the scramble to have diversity. I think it is sinister. When you write a new people in to a people’s history and mythology you are destroying their identity and their claims on their past. You are giving the new people a claim. At the same time that this is happening, you are invading the homelands and performing a pogram of the people whose story you are giving a new people claim to and ethnically replacing them in their homeland. This is vile, sinister and should shake all European descended peoples to their core.Egypt and Tunisia understand this and this is why they had zero tolerance for this race swapping. They condemned Negresspatra and even banned Kevin Hart from performing there since he claimed sub-saharans were Kangz. This is not an extreme over-reaction. It is a vital and healthy line in the sand. We are weak and wimpy with this idea of freedom of speech and freedom of expression. ‘Oh Kevin just said something that isn’t true but we’ll go and laugh at his jokes as he pokes us in the eye and claims our heritage.’ It is pathetic and shows how unserious we are.Egypt and Tunisia know that their past and an accurate depiction of it is critical for their future survival. If they permit blacks to be written into their story they know this opens them up to the billion plus sub-saharans feeling a legitimate claim on their lands and moving in and staking their claim. It is bad enough Europe has opened the gates to the aliens. But they come in and see that they dominate the cultural imagery and that the powerful who make films have written them into Our history. This is madness and it is extremely dangerous.This issue of identity and cultural integrity is the most important issue of our time.We must combat this by making our own art and entertainment. I know in my next major work it will be a reflection of what we were and will become again. Our guys must do this and find ways to get this distributed to a wider audience even if we can’t make it mass audience. It doesn’t have to be political but it has to be our story that features us and reflects who and what we were and are.Another thing we must do is make subversive art. I mentioned in that post some ideas. Things like:A movie or short about Moses or David that depicts the Hebrews as sub-saharans. Maybe fund a Kang to make that.A movie or short depicting the premeditated genocide of Deuteronomy that is sympathetic to the original Canaanites.A film or short or YT series depicting the Gates of Toledo, the Muslim incursions, the Asturian exile and the Reconquista in the light of the truth of the perfidy, betrayal as well as the determination, grit and valor of the Iberian Asturians.A movie or short depicting the horrors of the Haitian revolutionA movie or short depicting the civilization built by Rhodesia and its downfall and what it is now.The parodies that White Rabbit did were ingenious and brilliant. We need more of that, but we also need serious works that capture an audience in the context of a drama and not a parody. This way they internalize the knowledge needed to someday understand the parody.We must also set up networks and embed in homeschool curriculum specific sections on European and Euro-Diaspora identity that is positive, realistic and strong. This must happen now. Even a supplemental program for those who can’t or won’t escape Regime schools.We are in big trouble and it isn’t Diversity that this is. It is cultural pollution whose effect is to eradicate European identity and peoplehood; that establishes new, false claims on the identity and peoplehood of European peoples. It is genocidal and we must rise up to combat it.

                “Too many of our people have a deep deep sickness.”The *deep* sickness is as deep as their DNA.  There is no cure for most except through “harsh Darwinian selection”. In short, they are *not* our people, although they do pass for a reasonable facsimile on the surface.These people are the “Spiteful Mutants”, Dutton talks about in his recent book of the same name.  I applaud your attempt to rally support for reversing our cultural rot, but these SM’s are blind to such and do not see.  They may be suppressed until they die off, but changed back into “good” “traditional” Americans, doubtful. Besides, the White cultural degradations you point out in your two postings are less to convert Whites, than to instill belonging and motivation in non-Whites.

        I was in the diversity racket for 27 years, education.  My favorite line to the DEI crowd was diversity and equity in the same sentence was an oxymoron, we’re in education, can’t we see that?  Needless to say, quickly brushed aside!

        I am pretty confident that in the 1970’s the number of Africans in Ireland was infinitesimally small if there were any at all. And they were confined to Dublin. I would bet my entire net worth that there was not a single one living in rural Ireland. Of course, today is a different story. African immigrants are common. I am sure that the younger people working on the film think that black have always lived there. Ireland spent 800 years trying to break free of the British only to surrender totally to Globohomo with a gay Indian Prime Minister and waves of third world immigration.

        The diversity mandate in TV and movies is not an accident of rogue cultism. It is a deliberate and intentional aspect of the program to alter societal consciousness toward low-trust high-dependence conformity. There aren’t enough jackboots to quell the resistance when the SHTF, so passive compliance via mental reprogramming is a vital necessity for the new tecno-tyranny to succeed. Ditto for the CBDC, which also affords remote control over the masses. But a 70 year old Liam Neeson character is a good metaphor for the cure that must come to pass if we are to prevail over this tyranny. Yes, plant many trees when the time comes.

                    Does it matter?  Ever since the first Robin Hood movie in the 30’s, they bastardized the tale until nothing of the original plot line is recognizable except the names of the main characters.
This is why I rail against these “fiction based on fact” type of movies.  Folks watch and then come away thinking they know something about history.  Better they thought they knew nothing.

        Like many of you, I eschew most entertainment made after 2005 or so. With a few exceptions (John Carter, John Wick, Dredd) virtually nothing made in Hollywood in the past 20 years is worth watching.If you haven’t already done so, I suggest those looking for quality entertainment look eastward. Korea is cranking out some excellent content; I believeParasitewon a bunch of awards, and the action genre is improved with films such as TheDivine Moveand TheMan From Nowhere.Anime is also worth checking out for those who enjoy sci fi or fantasy. There’s a ton of garbage as well, but that’s true of any genre.Demon Slayer,for example, is filled with positive messages of perseverance and courage. Plus I love hearing Japanese spoken again.And maybe foreign movies portray a cultural message you can’t get behind. Fair enough. But at the very least they don’t cram !!!!THE MESSAGE!!!! down a person’s throat . Like, at all. So they have that going for them, at least.And who knows? I gather Korean culture is pretty thoroughly pozzed, and The Beast is making inroads into Japan with whining shrews and faqquets in the van, so this may all change soon. In the meantime, if you’re not one of these people who find subtitles an affront to apple pie and Chevrolet, there’s some fantastic movies/ shows available from our Aryan brothers away off in Nippon. (And the Garlic Eaters, too).

            I’ll get downvotes for this I’m sure, but I agree with you.  Some of the foreign films and TV being imported from services like NETFLIX are pretty entertaining and original.  Nothing wrong with watching those films shot in their own countries with their own actors.  However, I will note the Asians are getting quite “poz’d” as well.  More modern flix showing effeminized men and masculinization females. Those I never watch, they are quite creepy.

        “Those who thought it was a ridiculous addition to the film kept their head down because they did not want the lunatics from the cult of diversity hounding them over it.”This accurately describes the reaction of company employees to a mentally ill man who works here who is “transitioning”.  People just keep their heads down.  If you’re around people you know are safe, winks and eye rolls are common, but only in small groups or 1:1.  As the number of eye rollers has grown I’ve realized my company is actually pretty great.  Everyone’s just waiting on that one slip up that’ll give us a lawsuit defendable reason to terminate.  Trannies are mentally ill, so it won’t take long.  If you can’t figure out you’re a dude, all sorts of behavioral norms go out the window eventually.Anyway, the “keep your head down” thing is true.  My beautiful bride has also figured out that I’ll just walk out of the room if she settles on a TV program that has the mandatory gay cast member.  I save a lot of wasted time by not watching cooking or home improvement shows nowadays.  She’ll turn it off or change the channel.  If I land on a movie title I’m not familiar with, she’ll wink and say something like, “I don’t think that’s one you’ll enjoy.”Sometimes you don’t have to say anything.  Silence can mean non-consent, too.

                lol, “Our violence is speech, your speech is violence.”
I’m always proud of our side for its “turn the other cheek” approach to life.  But I fear those days are drawing to a close.  There are people who like to say “bring it on”, but it’s going to be bloody and horrific, and it’ll take 500 years to recover.

        OT: This is now openly talked about in the media:Biden showing signs of decline as pols, aides detail 81-year-old’s slipping cognitive fitness: ‘Not the same person’
President Biden’s cognitive decline is readily apparent and a concern for dozens who have interacted with the 81-year-old commander-in-chief in recent months, according to a shocking report Tuesday.


Some of the more the 45 Republican and Democratic lawmakers and staffers interviewed by the Wall Street Journal described a president who spoke so softly during meetings that participants struggled to understand him.

        Shame that Liam Neeson was never in a proper Star Wars movie as he’s about as perfect an image for a Jedi one can imagine.  Instead, he wound up instead paling around with Jar Jar Binks and that little brat kid in that proto-CGI crapfest.You know what’s funny about SW?  The original trilogy was “racist” even though George Pucas is a little liberal nerd.  America was still a white country in ’77, so it was accepted as fact that the proper Englishmen were Jedi/normal humans and the other races were  various aliens like Wookies, sand people, etc.  That’s what made it good!

It’s a great movie to watch to see what America uses to be like.

                Not as bad as “Maine buildsrent-freeapartments for migrants with taxpayer money”.
So where, really, is this going to go, when we’ve gotten beyond the “We urgently need Somalis on welfare to boost the economy!”
Once again, we are far outrun by the left.  They’re building a parallel economy on a massive scale.   I mean, even the basis for “money” is different.

                    Having come from New England, what happens when the money runs out in those places will be interesting. (And it will, I just don’t know when.) The natives know how to deal with winter. The Somalis don’t want to work and are there for the freebies.Have the money spigots finally shut off will result in violence/self deportation and probably both.

        Seems like tame DIE for a 2023 flick.  I’m just grateful the Neeson character didn’t strike up a romance with the peripatetic African and force the audience into nauseating homoerotic sex scene.  Woulda been unavoidable if it were a Netflix production.

        Sounds ridiculous, all right, but they missed an opportunity with the black immigrant.  He should have gone directly from complaining about violence in his home country, to head-stomping a white pub patron or raping a white girl.  Or both.  This would have added the missing verisimilitude.

                    “You have a point, but they still have to feed their monster with cash coming from customers”There is ample evidence of billionaires like Soros and Gates funding the destruction of the White Christian West. The movie propaganda under discussion coincides withallthe dogma of the evil Civic Religion, Satanic Inversionism, which every facet of Mammy Guvmint promotes 24/7 without a moment’s let-up..  The Mind control is ubiquitous, and funded by an inexhaustible pile of Money-bux.No business that relied on revenue generated by customers / sales could survive the sacrificial burning of the billions Disney threw away on theirStar Wokesfranchise. Any organization that required good will to fund itself would have been destroyed, and yetStar Wokesis only a single head of the global Hydra constantly pushing these anti-God ideas.They do not need your money.Again, I suspect if our Rulers could read these comments they would laugh heartily at the naivetè that they can be stopped by withholding our ticket money, then get right back to infecting our children’s brains with their social engineering poison.

                        Right. The executive producers need to only cough up at most tens of millions net, even if the movie is a flop.
Sometime we all have to wrap our heads around the concept that tens of millions isn’t that much to someone who has tens of billions to throw around. Particularly if they can make it back funding the occasional film that even we might be enticed into seeing.
If the ticket sales are going to affect this mess, you’ve got to boycott everything, including reruns on Netflix.

                        Agreed completely. However, it’s still best to boycott the sumbitches, just for spite.

        As minority checkbox insertions go I thought the fiddler was pretty tame and he’s got a tiny part. I really enjoyed the film overall, and thought the IRA girl leader came across as being a spiteful psychopath, not really anything for team diversity to cheer on.
Some directors are obviously filling in checkboxes to keep the DEIhards happy while still trying to produce entertaining content. House of Dragon is another example.

            The fact that they are included in the plotat allis the victory. Your remarks about the size of the midget fiddlers role, or your opinion about the demeanor of the Girl Boss, are criticisms on the fuzzy dice dangling from the rearview mirror on the Death Dozer as it plows you and everything you love into the dirt.
I suspect the perpetrators would be highly amused by your critique of their film, and the likelihood of its effects on their audience.

            “House of Dragon is another example.”
You’re new here I take it from your pseudo name.  I tuned into HoD to see what the follow on series to GoT would look like.  It was a ridiculous insult to the intelligence to see Blacks running around with bleached blond locks.  How could one watch enough to be interested?  Not a put down of your enjoyment, nor does it extend to dislike of any particular race in the movies—there is a time and place—just a dislike of ridiculous contrived situations in the name of DIE.

                It was ridiculous seeing the blonde dreads, but apart from that it’s pretty good. If 90% of what is on the menu is pure shit on a plate, I’m okay with having something served that’s only got a speck of it. Of course no shit would be better, like Banshees of Inisherin, but it gets boring watching the same library of pre woke content over and over again. Boomers seem to be cool with consuming the same narrow epoch’s content over and over again, but it gets old. If you’re aware of the propaganda you can presumably look past it – or did you dye your hair blue after your glimpse of HOD?
