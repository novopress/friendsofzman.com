        ‚Äù People fetishizing their rationality should be able to grasp this.‚Äù
In defense of Mx. MacDonald, politics is also the art of persuasion. You want to persuade your unpersuaded dinner guest to adopt your point of view. You sound rational and relatable. Then your crazy friends in the living room start freaking out to the sounds of Heavy Metal as your whacko brother, who thinks he‚Äôs Teddy Roosevelt, comes bursting through the door from down the basement, hollering something about charging up San Juan Hill. You gaze at your dinner guest with a sheepish grin. ‚ÄúHeh, heh, just ignore them‚Ä¶‚Äù

            Too late for persuasion. These people can not be persuaded. Your voice as against the mega propaganda voices of the media, the academy, the corporations, the censorship?
Get real. These people cannot be persuaded. They must be defeated. Otherwise our future is civil war, tyranny, or secession.

        Since the Grand Old Politburo are the jobber designated losers of the WCW/WWF clown show could we at least have some lovable losers instead of carpetbagger Mittens and other squishy bureauweenie nomenklatura apparatchik sellouts.What‚Äôs a Heather MacDonald?Is she one of the evolved enlightened ‚Äúsophisticated vaccinated‚Äù (h/t-NY Times) people?

        I received a link a couple months ago to some video claimed to be of a 1918 cartoon about the Spanish Flu called ‚ÄúEarly Warning.‚Äù This cartoon was laughably fake, nobody was talking about vaxxing the masses during the Spanish Flu, as medical tech was so primitive at the time that the idea they could have made a vax for this flu in time is laughable. I also pointed out that in 1918 radios such as were depicted in the cartoon were not readily available yet and that the term ‚Äúweaponize‚Äù was not attested anywhere until 1957. Of course I never heard back from that woman. The problem with hoaxes is even if you privately point it out the the person who got hoaxed, they always take it personally and resent you for it.

        As a casual listener to AJa couple things jump out to me.First, a lot of the outrageous things he says are tongue in cheek ‚Äì to make a point humorously. Like the frogs thing. Amphibians have been experiencing sixual transition in adulthood, which is a new phenomenon and the cause isn‚Äôt adequately understood by biologist who study such things. Which the assumption that some level of environmental pollution is causing it.Secondly, he has been more accurate in his observationations over the last twenty years than serious normiecon pundits such as Goldberg or Kristol or any of the other usual suspects. So whose nuttier, AJ for hypothesizing that the documented drop in testosterone levels is driven by the same factor affecting amphibians, or the normiecons that guaranteed that Iraq was a democracy waiting to be liberated and once it was freedom and peace would spread throughout the Mid East.

        Conservativeinc does not always lose.  In fact they‚Äôve won the long war on the issue that they really care about.  Which protecting their wealth and privilege.
All the social issues and the like that they leave lost on mover the years were only so much marketing bullshit to get the rubes on their side.
It‚Äôs past time to admit that the left was largely correct about them and that we were played.

            Nicely said. The anti abortion people did pretty well I‚Äôd say.Abortion is at an all time low in absolute and adjusted numbers and abortion clinics much less common.Its a push but its something.If the Right were not just another brand  of individualism and materialism or if such grifters  were quickly banished we‚Äôd have a shot .I think if this were the case though it would probably end up ‚ÄúLeftists actually shot‚Äù the Left is incremental and fairly relentless, almost an admirable trait which suggests like the Borg in Star Trek you destroy the whole cube or they‚Äôll just regenerate.Honestly I‚Äôm about ready for an authoritarian Right Wing society, enforced social conservatism and economic nationalism  along with a lot of repartitions make for a much more pleasant place than the madhouse we have now.

                The abortion issue is a prime example of coninc not doing anything.   They can‚Äôt even get something symbolic done like cutting off federal funding for planned parenthood.
A sane, rational republic or democracy would pretty quickly reach a compromise similar to what most of Europe has, with abortion legal up to a hard cut off ‚Äì 5 or 6 months ‚Äì and then completely illegal after that.
Instead, here, both parties benefit by keeping the issue at a low boil.

                    Someone once said of cancer, ‚ÄúThere is more money to be made looking for a cure, than finding a cure.‚Äù The rice bowl, or follow the money, argument, or whatever you‚Äôd like to call it, is a prime suspect in that and many spheres. Especially with any moral or political issue, they tend to be durable and popular. As such, there is ample money to be made in fund raising, speaking engagements, selling books and various other income-generating activity. Set up your non-profit corporation or other entity if you actively lobby poltically, probably in DC, and staff it to taste. These positions have the wonderful effect of being a way to ‚Äúbribe‚Äù selected people completely legally. You‚Äôre just giving someone a job, even if it‚Äôs clear she doesn‚Äôt do anything useful for the salary. With the funds, you can pass out grants to favored groups. The overhead (primarily salaries) is a large fraction of most enterprises‚Äô costs. Solving,or even addressing, the problem(s) your firm was set up to combat are strictly incidental.

            Give physiognomy a good amount of trust, and you will come out more times ahead ‚Äî especially when evaluating people you haven‚Äôt met.My stock picking strategy was always to look up the CEO and the board to see what they look like.  These are people who are strangers to me, and if I am going to trust them with my money I will do a basic physiognomy character read.And the strangest thing was how much derision this would get me from normies.   They went about using all their financial models and so forth.  And maybe that is a good play if all you want to do is make money.  But I also don‚Äôt want to be associated with someone like Zuckerberg and would never invest in FB, for example.  One look at that guy and you expect me to trust him?  Ok, yeah, he may have made you more but he ruined your country, which is to be expected just by looking at him.  Was it worth it, normie investor?

        Maybe the reason conservatives always lose is because their bad leaders choose the wrong hills to fight and die on for short term reasons.People can choose to get vaxxed or not, but why all of talk radio, Fox, Newsmax and other conservative media has to go full Braveheart over that issue is odd to say the least and counter-productive to say the worst. And that‚Äôs with whom my complaint is.With all the 60- and 70%-plus majority issues out there, why must conservative media focus on an issue that is championed by a distinct minority? Especially a position that the media talking heads themselves really don‚Äôt share ‚Äî Hannity, Levin, Ingraham, Gorka, Hanson are all vaxxed. None of them believe the vaccinations are either ineffective or unsafe ‚Äî And especially a position that makes its proponents sound crazy to the vast majority of normal people.Maybe they haven‚Äôt put on the Hitler costume, but the clown outfit is bad enough.There‚Äôs a well-known maxim in talk radio: if you want the phones to light up, start talking about abortion.But there‚Äôs a followup to that maxim, which is that it will be the same 20 fanatics who call again and again. Your audience, however, will find the discussion boring and tune out.Just as with abortion, shouting about vaccines and freedom is good in the moment, but you lose your audience. Our media should switch focus to more popular causes if they want to attract supporters.

Agreed.
We‚Äôve been prepping since forever, but even we are in the process of vastly upgrading our 2nd @mend3nt resources in anticipation of forced vaxxines.
If gl0b0h0m0 crosses that line here in the USA, then Heritage Amerikkka will ditch the Marquess of Queensberry Rules and take off the gloves.
PRO-TIP FOR GL0B0H0M0: Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt wanna be around when Heritage Amerikkka takes off the gloves.
That story don‚Äôt have a happy ending for y‚Äôall.

            Re celebrities getting the jabs: In the first place, the vaccinations likely ARE in fact ineffective (in the sense that they can‚Äôt provide immunity for more than several months; why already the calls for boosters, if that‚Äôs not true?) and they ARE unsafe, not just for current side effects, but most important (to me) is the complete abandonment of traditional time consuming safety studies.Plain skepticism would say that a lot of these people are lying about taking the jab. The ‚Äúparty line‚Äù of course is that Jab Good. Can you imagine a major media personality going on record and saying ‚ÄúNo, I think they‚Äôre unproven, and I refuse to take it‚Äù? He‚Äôd be fired the next day. They can claim to have taken the shot, and few people will question or be able to verify private health information. Even if some take the jab on-camera, there exists the possibility of fakery. What would have been more impressive, but perhaps too late now, would be for major celebrities to have taken the shot(s) on the record, with witnesses, at locations and with medications chosen at random by the ‚Äújury‚Äù, to eliminate any chance she gets saline instead of the real product.

            that‚Äôs what the vaccine passport is . once you are required to take a shot every time they say you need a booster , it is really simple to put  some sterilizing agent into  the shot. and just like that! overpopulation solved . If they are real cleaver, they can design it to only affect pale people. once they have the ‚Äúpassport‚Äù set up , the plebs will have no control over what criterial they use to say who is approved and who is not. and for whatever reason .

        The Zman seems to have a perpetual blind spot when it comes to anything regarding genetics and evolution, which he always seems to get wrong.  Now he‚Äôs bashing a ‚Äúsmall group of people who think vaccines alter your DNA.‚ÄùHere is the reality.  SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been found in human genomic DNA. This was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in April:https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/118/21/e2105968118.full.pdfQuoting from the Introduction:‚ÄúIn this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 sequences can integrate into the host cell genome by a LINE1-mediated retroposition mechanism. We provide evidence that the integrated viral sequences can be transcribed and that, in some patient samples, the majority of viral transcripts appear to be derivedfrom integrated viral sequences.‚ÄùFrom the Results section:‚ÄúIn contrast to the results obtained with acutely infected Calu3cells or lung organoids, up to 51% of all viral reads, and up to 42.5% of human‚Äìviral chimeric reads, were derived from the negative-strand SARS-CoV-2 RNA in some patient-derived tissues [published data (60, 61), patient clinical background available in the original publications] (Fig. 3 E‚ÄìG and SI Appendix,Tables S2 and S3). Single-cell analysis of patient lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from patients with severe COVID [published data (61)] showed that up to 40% ofall viral reads were derived from the negative-strand SARS-CoV-2 RNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Fractions of negative-strand RNA in tissues from some patients were orders of magnitude higher than those in acutely infected cells or organoids (Fig. 3 C‚ÄìG).‚ÄùQuoting from the Discussion section:‚ÄúWe present here evidence that SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of infected human cells in culture. For two of the integrants, we recovered ‚Äúhuman‚Äìviral‚Äìhuman‚Äù chimeric reads encompassing a direct target site repeat (20 or 13 bp), and a consensus recognition site of the LINE1 endonuclease was present on both ends of the hostDNA that flanked the viral sequences. These and other data areconsistent with a target primed reverse transcription and retroposition integration mechanism (41, 42) and suggest that endogenous LINE1 RT can be involved in the reverse transcription and integration of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the genomes of infected cells. ‚ÄùIn layman‚Äôs terms, they infected cultured human cells with SARS-CoV-2 and then found viral sequences in the genomic DNA from the cultured cells.  They established that endogenous human LINE1 reverse transcriptase activity can account for transcription from viral RNA to DNA, and that the resulting DNA can be integrated into genomic DNA by endogenous host mechanisms.Most importantly, they also found SARS-CoV-2 sequences in human DNA from patients with severe covid. This is the key result that establishes the principle that SARS-CoV-2 sequences can jump from virus to human DNA despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 does not contain a viral reverse transcriptase.Now that we know that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be reverse transcribed and integrated into human DNA, what are we doing? We are vaccinating hundreds of millions of people with SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Recent data has shown that vaccinated patients are still expressing spike protein up to 6 months after vaccination.  Hmmmm‚Ä¶..I wonder how that is happening.

                It was copied and pasted for people like you who will probably never read an original scientific publication.But as long as you want to have a pissing contest over who knows what about reverse transcriptase and retrotransposons, why don‚Äôt you do a blog post and explain to your readers why the PNAS publication didn‚Äôt actually find SARS-CoV-2 sequences in human genomic DNA, and then explain why it‚Äôs scientifically impossible for vaccine RNA to be incorporated into human DNA. Are you up for that?We‚Äôd all love to hear your version of why it just can‚Äôt happen. Maybe you can quote somebody who says it‚Äôs unlikely. Maybe you can get it published in PNAS. Then we will all feel safer because the Zman says nothing to worry about, nothing to see, ignore the cranks who think that viral RNA encoded sequences can be reverse incorporated in DNA.Send me your private email. I‚Äôll sent you my CV.  I guarantee I know as much or more about this than you‚Äôll probably ever know.

            This is interesting. A few months ago I posted here that I didn‚Äôt really buy the ‚Äúvaccines change your DNA‚Äù concept because, among other things, Covid isn‚Äôt known to carry a retrotranscriptase. I suggested that the only way to save the DNA modding notion would be if Covid RNA had a recognition sequence similar to that of another virus that did have such a retrotranscriptase and that got in at the same time. Viral co-infection can have interesting effects. It didn‚Äôt occur to me that it might use something the host itself made. So maybe the tinfoilers were onto something after all.

            Hi Homer,I posted a link to a letter written in response to your PNAS article in a comment down thread. Key statement from this letter (which is critical of the paper you cite):‚ÄúIt remains unlikely that retrotranscription and integration of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in patients happens at any notable frequency, or even at all.‚Äù ‚Äìhttps://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2109066118So what is happening? While PNAS is prestigious journal, its review process is a little different than most journals. Articles can be submitted for publication by academy members following review by reviewers nominated by the academy member. This means that the submitting authors can pick their reviewers and, potentially, avoid criticism from hostile reviewers to get the paper published. In this case the Jaenisch paper appears to be published fast (only 2 reviewers, both selected by Jaenisch, 3 weeks from submittal to publication) and is now under fire from other scientists. It will take more time for this to get resolved. Given the circumstances of publication, odds are good that the findings from the paper you cite won‚Äôt be repeatable.

            I think the bone of contention here is whether the virus (SARS-CoV2) or the mRNA vaccines enter the DNA. That‚Äôs a pretty significant difference. It is no surprise that the virus enters DNA b/c that‚Äôs what vira (‚Äòviruses‚Äô) do. They can‚Äôt replicate on their own. That does not meant hat the vaccine does the same.The idea behind mRNA vaccines is pretty good. It is to inject mRNA, the form of RNA that then ‚Äòtranslated‚Äô (i.e. converted) into a protein in the body. By using mRNA instead of the proteins, you don‚Äôt need to be working with actual vira in the lab and hence they are safer to mass produce and should, theoretically, provide less risk of an adverse reaction in the recipient (b/c the immune system is far better at responding to proteins than to RNA (or DNA for that matter)).BUT, what they often don‚Äôt say in MSM is that this is the FIRST mRNA vaxx ever released for use in humans. Not the first made or the first used on animals but the first used on humans on a grand scale. And, biology being biology, we don‚Äôt know what the effects of this is. So personally I‚Äôm taking a rain check on the vaxx for the moment. But you documented that the VIRUS enters DNA. And we knew that. That does not mean the mRNA vaccines do.

                The mistake these people are making is this. A pathogen can alter the DNA of a cell. That is not the same as altering your genome. If your DNA gets changed, you die instantly. The cell, on the other hand, can be re-engineered by a pathogen like a virus to do something else. This does not mean your genome is now changed.

                    What you‚Äôre saying is not entirely true but the point still stands that there is no reason to think the vaccine enters DNA and no rational reason, not counting ‚Äògenocide conspiracies‚Äô, why ppl would want it to.

                        No, it is entirely true. People are confusing gene therapy with germline editing. Gene therapy alter the DNA of specific cells and these changes cannot be passed onto future generations. Germline editing is where the genome is edited in an embryo.

                    You‚Äôre confusing a few things it‚Äôs also a matter of semantics. You are right that by altering the DNA of a few somatic (ie. none germ cells) you affect no heritability. And this is basically the idea behind gene therapy. It sounds like you‚Äôre addressing the fear that ppl will then pass ‚Äòvaccine genes‚Äô onto their offspring and you‚Äôre absolutely right that there is no reason to think this would happen. Or that the vaccine would alter the DNA in ALL cells. Except for the changes that may be part of why the immune system memory cells recall old antigens encountered, I don‚Äôt think the vaccine changes ANY DNA.You do not necessarily die if you‚Äôre DNA is changed, it absolutely depends on the changes made, like a computer code. Random changes, yes you probably destroy it. But minor changes, well, that‚Äôs mutations and they can be good or, more commonly, bad.

            I haven‚Äôt really kept up with Jones in about thirty years, but based on the few vids I‚Äôve seen since the covid shots became the big subject, he‚Äôs the least irrational popular commentator on them. He *sounds* nuts, but that‚Äôs his thing. The logic under the rhetoric is sound.

                To turn mRNA into DNA that‚Äôs inserted into the cell‚Äôs chromosomes, the vaccine, not the virus, would need to have the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Going out on a limb by assuming less than total insanity, they presumably did not include that enzyme in the vaxx.

                Alzaebo:Thank goodness no HIV researchers were involved at the Wuhan shenanigans, amirite?For those who aren‚Äôt aware, Alzaebo is referring to some very early work by the street-sh!tters showing the presence of HIV strands which had been artificially inserted into the SARS-COVID bioweapon.Gl0b0h0m0 yanked the street-sh!tters‚Äô work almost immediately*, but fortunately  Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier learned of it, and helped publicize the findings.*Just like Gl0b0h0m0 yanked the Johns Hopkins g00kette‚Äôs epidemiological research indicating that, when corrected for age** of the population, there was NO increase in deaths in the USA in 2020 [vis-a-vis previous years, again, corrected for age of the population].**You have to correct for age of the population, because the massive leading edge of the demographic wave which is the Baby Boomers, born beginning in 1946, is now crossing its 75th anniversary threshold, and death statistics will necessarily increase by gargantuan leaps &amp; bounds over the next decade or two.

All by design.

        As I await moderation, I will say that Disney and Apple are both vulnerable. They are doing things that seem a desperation to create profits. Both Emma Stone and Scarlett Johanssen are suing Disney over being cheated out of Box Office revenue sharing (so execs can make quarterly profit numbers likely) and Apple months after touting privacy is spying on everyone‚Äôs Iphone (to sell the data likely for cash).The FT noted that the studios basically theme parks with movies and TV as ancillary money makers. We should push the Justice Democrats, the Squad, and others to raise the Theme Park wages to $30 an hour. We should also demand for reparations that all blacks receive free admission to theme parks. This would destroy Disney as the profit center would be turned into a loss center (think of the vibrant cultural enrichment like Freaknik in Atlanta). Streaming is a dead loss, requiring Wall Street to shovel endless amounts of money. It requires acquiring subscribers cheaply, keeping them, and minimizing churn. The ideal streaming business would have everyone signed up but no one watching (hence no costs for peak viewing); inflation alone will have consumers dumping even streaming which is currently priced too cheap to make money.Apple ‚Äî well we can push the idea that Apple is selling all your data by spying on you, and will use it as well to cancel: Christians, Jews Republicans, etc. People can switch to Android easily enough and that alone would likely kill Apple as they are no longer growing and can‚Äôt support the Android margins.

            Whiskey, I‚Äôm sorry to kick the hornets‚Äô nest, but do you think ‚ÄúJ3w$ Republicans‚Äù would ever accept a strict immigration policy?Strict immigration is where I see almost all ‚Äúbased j3w$‚Äù abandoning our cause.  I grant that many conservative j3w$, a very small number, want to suppress black crime but I foresee almost all of them screaming ‚ÄúH1tl3r!‚Äù if we tried to impose a rational immigration policy.  Certainly, almost all j3w$ in the world are radical left wing, so if we had some sort of values based (civnat) immigration policy then almost all j3w$ would be prohibited from immigrating here and this would be unacceptable.Am I wrong?

                    The JQ isn‚Äôt quite the Q, but it‚Äôs probably the second best proxy (after profession).Something like half of Jews are ‚Äúbased‚Äù/etc., but those aren‚Äôt the ones you‚Äôre going to meet or hear from, and they‚Äôre not the ones who decide anything. The blue-checks who are proceeding through the genocide checklist against (other) white people, and the Israeli ruling class who use Americans as livestock, are probably the worst people in the world. The rest of Jews are just regular dudes or Amish-style isolated weirdos like we aspire to be.In comparison, what percentage of, e.g., CFOs, human resource directors, or professors of physics, if given the choice, would let you live? Zero.

                I haven‚Äôt been to Disney world since 1983, when my parents paid about $20 for me (12 years old), two days admission.  A 12 year old today, going during Easter week, would be on the hook for nearly $300.
Worse than that is that the company is so pozzed they‚Äôre probably only a year or two away from giving minorities, homes, and illegals priority over whites.  Their commercials feature little else but blacks and coal burners.

        Great post at Takis. I would add that Derb linked to both Dreher (who ran away screaming) and another guy who had the ‚ÄúSalazar Option.‚Äù I agree with the analysis of the latter that the Benedict Option is doomed to failure. The Woke will not rest until all non-Woke are dead and White kids are either trannies or playthings of the big shots. However the Salazar Option is also doomed to failure: ALL of the Military, Federal, State, and Local government, bureaucrats, ngos, Media, Law, and BigCorps are against us and any slow down of the Genocide Express.That does not mean we cannot do anything. While Glenn Reynolds has many flaws, his key insight was that ordinary people attacking in a swarm like a cloud of mosquitoes can bring down powerful institutions and players: the ‚ÄúArmy of Davids.‚Äù Conceptually that is quite powerful.I think it is possible for an Army of Davids through collective action to at least destroy two of the major BigCorps who collectively are the schwerpunkt or hinge of battle for GloboHomo: Disney and Apple. I will put that separately.

        A rational question is whether the vaccine does more harm than good. Given we now know the vaccine (a) doesn‚Äôt prevent transmission and (b) doesn‚Äôt prevent contraction of Covid, the answer is not at all clear. Does the vaccine mitigate the effects of Covid? Show us the proof rather than make naked assertions. I haven‚Äôt read the linked story yet, but it is intellectually dishonest to claim there is a clearcut case to be made to take the vaccine, more now than two weeks ago.

        ‚Äú‚ÄúAlex Jones claiming the vaccine will alter your DNA is no nuttier than much of what is in the mass media. In fact, a ridiculous claim is far less harmful than the plausible, but inaccurate claim.‚ÄùYeah, about this. While I don‚Äôt *believe* it can happen, based on the very little I know about microbiology, it‚Äôs far from the tinfoiliest thing out there.The usual way things go in human cells is that the DNA unzips, certain polymerases create RNA from the DNA (other polymerases create more DNA from the DNA). The RNA diffuses out of the nucleus to ribosomes, and proteins are formed.Certain RNA viruses called retroviruses (the retro here standing for going backwards from RNA to DNA) code for stuff called reverse transcriptase, which, once it‚Äôs made by the cell, turns the rest of the viruses RNA into DNA, some of which can end up in the nucleus. This is why something like HIV is nearly impossible to eradicate. Your cells can remember how to make the virus even if there are no actual virus bits left in the cell.COVID isn‚Äôt a retrovirus (probably? Though sometimes COVID RNA gets bodged into a DNA strand for some reason). The vaccines don‚Äôt contain reverse-transcriptase, just some RNA coding for a protein.But human cells are ludicrously complex and diverse, and contain all sorts of madness. Other more primitive non-animal cells mix and match RNA and DNA in both directions in a crazy molecular anarchy. It‚Äôs far from an *unreasonable* fear that somewhere there is some molecule that will do the RT-job and keep copies of the protein-coding instruction around. A biology establishment that hadn‚Äôt spent the past year setting it‚Äôs trust and credibility on fire could explain to the public about how this stuff works. (The level of detailed control over RNA is an achievement. I could understand why a biologist would be offended at the ‚Äúrejection‚Äù of their accomplishment.)The current set of lizards? The same people who fantasize about cutting humanity down to size, and openly hate the people they want to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù? Why trust that what‚Äôs in the syringe is even a vaccine?

            COVID isn‚Äôt a retrovirus (probably?The CDC can‚Äôt tell you because they‚Äôve never isolated it.Finally, new FOIA documents have surfaced, revealing the CDC has never isolated any covid-19 virus. A Canadian named Christine Massey has reportedly filed multiple FOIA requests with the CDC, requesting the following via the Freedom of Information Act:All studies and/or reports in the possession, custody or control of the CDC and/or the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) describing the purification of any ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Ä≥ virus (including B.1.1.7‚Äù, ‚ÄúB.1.351‚Äù, ‚ÄúP.1‚Äù and any other ‚Äúvariant‚Äù) (via maceration, filtration and use of an ultracentrifuge; also referred to at times by some people as ‚Äúisolation‚Äù), directly from a sample taken from a diseased human, where the patient sample was not first combined with any other source of genetic material (i.e. monkey kidney cells aka Vero cells; fetal bovine serum).In a response letter dated June 7th, 2021, the CDC responded:A search of our records failed to reveal any documents pertaining to your request. Specifically, the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease apprises that CDC does not purify or isolate any COVID-19 virus in the manner the requestor describes

            I didn‚Äôt know all domestic chickens- all, as in ALL- need a vaccine to counter the ‚Äúleaky vaccine‚Äù experiment that was tried on Marek‚Äôs chickens, and superspread itself throughout our bird farm population.
Huh.  Almost like needing ‚Äúboosters‚Äù by subscription to survive the latest strains incubating in asympiomatic vaccinated people.
Better yet, since it is indeed affecting women‚Äôs reproductive organs, we‚Äôre looking at a full Children of Men for the white folk.

                Oh wait- that means coding to produce said proteins is inheritable in the chickens, changed DNA, just like the CDC said (I think, some official organ).  Inherited sterility unless we get the officially supplied antidote.  If you want to breed, you‚Äôd best comply.

        The militant vaxers are the same people who would have supported prohibition in 1920.  This issue is flipped but these are the same people who would have taken away your bottle of whiskey because they know what‚Äôs good for you.  And just like the prohibition era, there needs to be a strong cohort of people who say, who the hell are you anyway?  GTFO of my life.

        The circle of acceptable ideas is getting narrower and narrower.
Although freedom of speech still technically exists, in polite company you can only go so far.
There used to be room for eccentrics to spout their craziness; now the eccentrics are being shut down (viz. Alex Jones). Eccentrics perform a vital role in mass society. They define informal limits to conversation. When the perimeter of speech is pushed back toward the politically-middle center there is a corresponding drop in men willing to speak their minds freely. It‚Äôs just too risky.

            What I don‚Äôt get is this:  the media has always had a left wing bias, but during the Trump years, the hysteria and over-the-top lying was off the charts.  As such, why anyone would believe anything spouted by leftards and the msm ‚Äì especially about covtardedness, is beyond me.  I mean you have to have a baseline that everything from the left/msm is a outright lie or highly exaggerated, period.

        ‚ÄúAlex Jones claiming the vaccine will alter your DNA is no nuttier than much of what is in the mass media. In fact, a ridiculous claim is far less harmful than the plausible, but inaccurate claim.‚ÄùTrue and important, though most people (seem like they) don‚Äôt get it. Buckley famously said he‚Äôd rather be ruled by the first 500 names in the Boston phone book (remember them?) than the faculty of Harvard. Point being that common sense was better than ‚Äúsmarts‚Äù.  Sort of like owning the ‚Äústupid party‚Äù label.I recently thought of an updated version, after one of those stories about some 3rd world pilot deliberately crashing an airliner: who would you prefer as an airline pilot: a dumb guy, or a crazy guy? No matter how dumb the White nationalist is, he‚Äôs not TRYING to kill you, so you‚Äôd be better off taking your chances with him.

        Z-man‚Äôs said this again and again in so many ways.  Second verse, same as the first.  Leave your virtues at the door, go inside, beat the shit out of your enemies.  Win at all cost.  When leaving, pick up your virtues at the door.  Continue on with your life.  Your virtues remain intact and will serve you and your people well in the future.  As for anyone else, they were never meant for them anyway.

            Great comment. Allow me to add some nuance.Virtue is important in the big picture sense of leading a life well lived, i.e. it‚Äôs comes into play most of the time and over the long haul. But if your hiking in the woods and a bear attacks you, virtue has no useful purpose in the instant. You are fighting for your life and you do what you must.A time will come when most people comprehend the existential nature of the societal cancer that is killing us in slow motion at present. When that happens, people WILL fight back tangibly (not just delude themselves about voting, messiahs, and the cavalry coming over the hill to save them).And I would argue that our obligation is to fight back smarter rather than harder. In simplest terms, this means focusing on the core of the problem, and then acting only on terms &amp; timing that are favorable to your success. Intelligence, creativity, stealth, and spontaneity can be extremely useful in this endeavor. Opportunism is your friend. Ideally, leave them asking . . . what the fuck just happened?

        Their bitching about this stuff is ironic. The ‚ÄúEstablishment‚Äù were the first to politicize Covid and they did it right from the beginning, before the lock-downs even started.

            It‚Äôs a clique to point this out, but the pictures from the Obama birthday bash shows that no one was wearing a mask.
Just like with the BML riots, where few wore masks, the authorities say nothing and shut down those who notice.
You‚Äôd think, if the authorities really believed what they say about Covid, then they would be hysterical over the risk to which their beloved Obama and BML rioters were exposed.

                If you really want to give yourself liver failure, you can play my favorite drinking game, called ‚ÄúIf They Were Serious.‚Äù First you think of some big public issue. Then you make a list of what a real, serious government that took its mandate seriously would do. Then you make a list of all the things the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù clowns of Clown World are doing. Then you compare the lists, drinking one beer for each item on the ‚Äúcurrently doing‚Äù list that‚Äôs completely irrelevant to the issue, and one shot for every item that is completely opposite of what any sane, rational society would do.For instance, the magic masks. We are informed that The Virus (move over, HIV, Corona gets the capital letters now) lingers on surfaces for‚Ä¶ what are we up to now? Weeks? Months? Whatever, point is, if it survivesat alloutside the body, all masks should be disposable, and there should be dudes in Hazmat suits in front of every place people are still allowed to go, ready to incinerate those disposables with extreme prejudice the minute they‚Äôre off the face. Instead, you can‚Äôt walk down a city street without stepping on fifteen of them, and if you spend just five minutes watching the behavior of people wearing those ‚ÄúI obviously haven‚Äôt washed this in three weeks‚Äù cloth versions‚Ä¶Note: This was for rhetorical purposes only. You don‚Äôt want to actually try this, unless you‚Äôre determined to go out like Dylan Thomas.

If face diapers worked and Beer Flu was super deadly there should be incineration points or vats of rubbing alcohol to drop masks in.

If Beer Flu wete super persistent and deadly a single mask tossed on a trail in the woods would lead to a superspreader event.

1) St00pid cops don‚Äôt ask questions, and always do as they‚Äôre told.
2) St00pid cops aren‚Äôt smart enough to investigate Gl0b0h0m0 itself.

        We talk a lot about not accepting the left‚Äôs moral framework.  For the mRNA shots, we should also not accept calling them ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù or calling those opposed ‚Äúanti-vaxxers.‚Äù  Many who are opposed to these shots are not opposed to vaccines.

        Regarding Z‚Äôs Taki column and whether the revolution will end in bloodshed, who knows, but it is a fact that the morality tale underpinning of this revolution have no brakes to stop that from happening.The revolution is based on the idea that all groups are equally capable and, therefore, all groups should achieve equally. Obviously, that slams into the reality of the human condition as Z put it.There‚Äôs nothing in the fundamental beliefs of this revolution to allow differences in outcomes to exist. It would mean admitting that the revolution is wrong. They have no wiggle room.Normally, this would almost guarantee bloodshed; however, there is a wild card in this case. The revolution is organized, promoted and paid for by a group that isn‚Äôt actually revolutionaries. They created the revolution to promote their interests and to settle an old grudge, but they have no great belief in the ideals of the revolution and likely have no great desire to see society completely overturns, if for no other reason than they more or less run the current society.The real question is whether this group can control the revolutionaries? Can they deftly change the ideals of the revolution enough to keep the revolutionaries under control?If they can, things will continue to get crappier for whites, but there likely won‚Äôt be any serious bloodshed. If they can‚Äôt, things could get ugly.

            &gt; The real question is whether this group can control the revolutionaries? Can they deftly change the ideals of the revolution enough to keep the revolutionaries under control?I doubt the masterminds can retain full control of their pet revolutionaries because many of the latter are true believers and the ideals of the revolution are bound to come into conflict with the interests of the true elite. Additionally, the revolutionaries are generally low quality people. We‚Äôre already seeing examples of poor execution and the social capital is quickly being spent. It won‚Äôt be long until the masses have zero trust in the institutions and nothing but disdain for the owners and their retarded managers.I think there will be a ton of bloodshed however. At the core of all this is simple metaphysical evil. The point is to destroy civilization and make people suffer. The control grid will get off the ground and soon after sputter then crash and burn, and many of use will be caught in the wreck. But then the strong men phase begins so there‚Äôs that!

        Well Ms. MacDonald can have the not-vax herself.   If fact she can take it and have 10 buster shots a month for all I care.  The point is there is quite a bit of evidence that the not-vax is not good.I will take the word of Dr. Malone, who invented the mRNA brew.   He says that mass vaxing people with a non-sterilizing vaccine while the infection is in the environment is very dangerous.   We are seeing evidence of ADE already.So whether this not-vax alters your DNA or not is a side issue.  Does it do what the pushers say it does?   It looks like it does not.  Does it cause harm?  In many it already has.  Is it safe in the long term?  No one knows.

        I‚Äôm not familiar with Alex Jones. I read enough fringe opinion as it is (viz, the present forum üòÄ  ) But seriously, allow me to briefly address his claim that the jabs may alter DNA. I‚Äôm just a layman, but I believe that it is at least POSSIBLE that that could be true! Consider the following arguments: some viruses are known to be able to insert part of their data into human DNA. In fact, it‚Äôs estimated that a significant fraction of the human genome are fragments of ancient viruses. Since the mRNA jabs are, in simplest terms, a fragment of viral RNA/DNA, it therefore is at least conceivable that mRNA jabs could, in fact, modify a cell‚Äôs DNA.Since today‚Äôs essay deals at the least indirectly with the controversy over the safety of the jabs, here are some more facts (opinion) about it. Like many, I am deeply distrustful of government and the pandemic has not increased my confidence in the WHO, FDA, NIH; quite the opposite in fact. I‚Äôm not skeptical of the jabs because of a remote (in my estimation) chance of some evil re-writing of my DNA, but for more fundamental, broader reasons. These are primarily the urgency, the discarding of traditional protocols, the many inconsistencies in the official narrative. Rushing an experimental series of treatments, throwing away many standards of safety, against a virus, even if an escaped lab experiment, that really isn‚Äôt all that dangerous to most people, raises a lot of eyebrows. It should.

            We‚Äôre in the middle of the largest clinical trial in history.I‚Äôve read a decent amount on the vaccine. A lot of stuff out there is nonsense. But what‚Äôs not nonsense is that it simply hasn‚Äôt had enough time to confirm whether or not it has long-term side effects. There‚Äôs a reason you do usually wait awhile before offering a drug or vaccine to the general public.I understand why they made it available quickly to the elderly or for those with comorbidities, but for the general population, they should have waited to see what the clinical trials were showing.It‚Äôs all about risk. The risk to the elderly was high enough to take a vaccine with no long-term data. The risk to 20-year-old wasn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt.

                I believe I qualify as ‚Äúelderly‚Äù: 75.
My perception of the risk to me from this flu was that it was minimal, that wearing a mask could do more harm than good, that I‚Äôd be well-advised to avoid crowds (I always do anyway) and that under no circumstances would I permit myself to be injected with unproven substances that could likely prove more dangerous to me than a case of the flu. During the course of this year, I‚Äôve doubled down on those beliefs and see nothing shaking my confidence in them.

                    Yes. And over what? By historical epidemiological standards, the Fauci Flu is really quite minor, and up until ca. 1990, society would have taken basic, common sense steps to address the situation rather than self-immolate. Only mass hysteria, doubtless abetted by the feminization of society, can account for what we‚Äôre seeing.

                        The origins of the great reset are well established by papers published over the past few decades.  The scientific research into corona and other virus, mRNA gene therapy and the like are decades old.  You can read their papers and patents.  The whole line of research has been financed by Bill Gates, Karl Schwab, the WHO, etc.  Tried and true responses to ‚Äòpandemics‚Äô from the past have been abandoned for jab the world/shut down the economy insanity.  To what end we all wonder?  Well Alex Jones and others have pieced the puzzle together and it looks like a concerted effort to genocide human beings to implement a radical restructuring on a global scale: neo feudalism is what I call it. The cause has been established by evidence and hysteria and feminization are abetting the propagation of evil.

            There is much more against the ‚Äúvexxine‚Äù than a remote possibility of DNA modification.  I‚Äôve never really considered that possibility given how I‚Äôm told the mRNA technology works and there seems little disagreement among even the scientific community detractors of that process.  What we are seeing now wrt adverse effects seem to follow predictions about the vexxine‚Äôs production of spike proteins and the antibodies produced thereby.As stated, there seem to be benefit‚Äôs and costs.  If the benefits outweigh the costs, one is foolish to not choose the jab.  My concern has been for many years, who makes that determination‚Äîthe government or me?  The government does not necessarily have my best interest at heart, so I‚Äôd rather reserve such decisions for myself.

        Huh?
‚Äù   ‚ÄúSome of them think vaccines in general may not be all that safe and are refusing this vaccine. Imagine that? People in the middle of a heated partisan fight putting aside reason to score points against the enemy?
How is that ‚Äòputting aside reason ‚Äò? If the ‚Äòreasonable- sounding‚Äô stories about the problems with the vaccines are just that (reasonable sounding), then reason is not being put aside.McDonald has cucked.

                Well, I‚Äôd probably trust Putin more than I would trust our PTB right now, plus Sputnik is an adenovirus vaccine, not mRNA, just like J&amp;J, so there‚Äôs that. Whether or not it works or not I don‚Äôt know, but I am pretty sure that it was at least designed to work, as opposed to simply making ash*t-ton of money of Big Pharma.

                    This is exactly the kind of thing I‚Äôm talking about, and I agree with you. Isn‚Äôt Big Pharma eeeeevil? I could swear I heard that somewhere‚Ä¶. ah yes, it was from ‚Äúevery single fucking Liberal in America, for as long as I‚Äôve been alive, right up until the morning of January 20, 2021.‚Äù And now, just like that, Big Pharma is great! Can‚Äôt wait to get those Big Pharma shots! Those have to be made mandatory asap!Or the other side: Isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgovernment health care‚Äù bad? I could swear I head that somewhere‚Ä¶ ah yes, it was from ‚Äúeveryone on the Right, since at least the Hillarycare debacle, right up until the middle of March 2020.‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty sure I could search Steve Sailer‚Äôs archives and find plenty of skepticism, to put it no more strongly, about government meddling in the healthcare sector‚Ä¶ and yet, here we are. Can‚Äôt wait to get those government goop shots! We love Big Brother.Those two facts alone, in my view, justify some very hefty skepticism about any so-called vaccine. If we were all back in high school together, talking about girls, we‚Äôd say that lots of folks are thinking with the wrong head. That never works out well.

        The Pro-vax aggression from on high was evident last December, when they started making claims that pregnant women should take it as it was being rolled out with zero long term studies.  This is the height of irresponsibility.  This quickly became a classist flashpoint.  The coastal ‚Äúelites‚Äù (who are far from elite) are always looking for an issue in which they can compare themselves to the inland ‚Äúmouth breathers.‚Äù  This was the perfect virtue signaling issue that goes far beyond the virus.  This goes to the ‚ÄúWe believe in The Science‚Äù part of their Nicene creed.  To refuse the vaccine, you‚Äôre in reality a terrible selfish person.  And now that we‚Äôre finding out that these vaccines are failing they quickly switched it up with ‚Äúmy vaccine won‚Äôt work unless you take your vaccine.‚Äù  The mental gymnastics are amazing.  The vaccine mandates aren‚Äôt about the virus, they‚Äôre about a segment of society that has such a visceral hatred for the inlanders in their jacked up trucks that they fantasize about holding them down and injecting them.  Only they want it to be potassium chloride.  They imagine each and every January 6th ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù being anti-vax.  They‚Äôre dirty people.  Pay no attention to the dirty people running across the border, they have clean souls and intentions, so they‚Äôre fine.  Of course the neo-cons have the most insulting, demeaning comments of all about anti-vaxers, because they see them as cannon fodder that got uppity.

This stance, delivered by anyone other than those in my close circle, effectively has me thinking: ‚ÄúWhy would I want to take some hastily prepped, mystery jab to keep this sissy safe‚Äù. Quite honestly, such people may as well be dead to me ‚Äì I am sick of the guilt tripping and moralizing.
The relentless pushing and propagandizing behind it has been phenomenal.

        It is discomforting when some of the more wild claims of the mRNA vax side effects turn out to be plausible. There is indeed a danger that the vaccine can encode the spike protein into DNA, at least if this vaccine journal is to be believed.https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/23/51See page 62.‚ÄúPermanent Incorporation of Spike Protein Gene into human DNAIt has been claimed that mRNA-based vaccines are safer than DNA-vectored vaccines that work by incorporating the genetic code for the target antigenic protein into a DNA virus, because the RNA cannot become inadvertently incorporated into the human genome. However, it is not at all clear that this is true. The classic model of DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí protein is now known to be false. It is now indisputable that there is a large class of viruses called retroviruses that carry genes that reverse transcribe RNA back into complementary DNA (cDNA).  In 1975, Howard Temin, Renato Dulbecco, and David Baltimore shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975 for their discovery of reverse transcriptase and its synthesis by retroviruses (such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) toderive DNA from RNA (Temin and Mizutani, 1970, Baltimore, 1970)‚ÄùThis entire paper is well worth a read. It feature sober rational discussions of the vaccine risks, including ADE, clots and more.

            This is why it‚Äôs perfectly rational to take a pass on the vaccine.  First, it‚Äôs a cold that happens to take out the old and fat at a disproportionate level, but not much beyond the common flu (which disappeared from society for now).  This isn‚Äôt smallpox.  Second, if your government has proven its incompetence on issues A through X, why would we assume their competence on issues Y and Z?  This is important because they gave the pharma companies immunity from their vaccine products.  So we depend on government scientists, who probably now have to be 30% African bone-rollers, to call the shots on our health.  I would much prefer taking a vaccine where if Moderna knows that if it messes up, they‚Äôll get (((class actions))) that would make their heads spin.  I don‚Äôt even like flying anymore because of government incompetence.  But at least Boeing is still open to lawsuits, which means they can‚Äôt mess up too bad.

                If you‚Äôre a reasonably healthy person in good physical condition, which includes almost all young people, you should have no fear of covid. Rely on your own immune system.

                The liability shield is not only Big Pharma. Vaccine makers are protected by a specific law. Under the PREP Act of 2005, as long as a product is Emergency Use Authorization AND/OR a declaration of emergency (e.g. pandemic) remains in effect, there is near-total immunity to liability for the entire spectrum of service providers, I‚Äôd guess that shield extends from the truck driver who hauls the vaccines from the manufacturer, to the scarcely-trained clerk at the drug store or the drive-through that administers the jabs.

        First, the article by Heather McDonald is probably just a simple case of opportunism greed. The editors at Science &amp; Tech likely went looking for a shill at Conservative Inc. in order to craft a anti-vaxxer putdown piece that ‚Äúappears‚Äù bipartisan. And my guess is that she whored herself out for a quick buck, and neither idealistic principle nor rationality had anything to do with it. I wonder what she charges for a BJ, or if you get a discount for taking the jab.But to the more important issue addressed in today‚Äôs post. Conservative Inc. is not going to save us, no matter how much yakking they do on the internet or whether that yakking is optimized in some form or fashion. We can only save ourselves, and in a real world, that requires tangible action. Words alone are insufficient.

        The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I‚Äôll ally with anybody (within reason) if they are promoting my agenda. When they are no longer aligned in my direction, I‚Äôll cut them off and find a new ally.I was at some of the anti lockdown / anti vax protests. There really were a mix of people.‚Äì There were the tinfoil hatters handing out all kinds of pamphlets and buttons, ranging from information about how the vaccine turns you into Big Foot, to the dangers of international Zionism (Joos), to 5G nanoparticles.‚Äì There were the granola, hippy Boomers who don‚Äôt want to inject chemicals into their body.‚Äì There were the younger libertarian potheads, who had the annoying habit of smoking joints during the marches (but at least they‚Äôre on the right side here).‚Äì There were the pissed off small business owners, and eastern euro immigrants/descendants who don‚Äôt want a return to communism.‚Äì There were the normal people who just want a normal life. There were also random people who seem angry and like walking around yelling at things.Anyways, the organizers stuck to the core message of no forced vaccines, and no more lockdowns. Went great, a diverse group of people but the message was very clear. There are not our guys and probably cucked on race, but this particular movement is aligned with our interests at this time.

        From what I understand of it, the mRNA tech does reprogram cells‚Äî like a virus will. That doesn‚Äôt mean it alters every cell in your body. Some people will take a kernel of truth and run away with it, others will hear it and assume you‚Äôre making an unreasonable statement. C‚Äôest la vie.I‚Äôm interested to know about vaccine shedding. If the wonder shot only reprograms cells to produce part of the virus (the spike protein), I‚Äôd think it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue except, perhaps, for the vaxxed or unvaxxed massively exposed. If it reprograms cells to produce an entire virus, well, then the wonder shot is effectively a synthetic virus and therefore might as well be a bioweapon.

            The way to think of it is this way. The vaccine kills a group of your cells, but in the process of these cells dying, they trigger an immune response to a specific protein, one associated with this coronavirus. That‚Äôs not a precise explanation, but good enough for our purposes. As with everything you put in your body, there is some risk to these injections.

                The vaxx was initially sold as staying very close to the injection site but now even The Experts(tm) have admitted it goes all over the body, including the brain and lungs. There are other little details like that which the officials will admit.I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre underselling the risk of these things. There are plenty of credible smart people ringing the alarm bells and one doesn‚Äôt need to be a microbiologist to understand the concepts. But forget all that, the most important thing is that this is a new technology that hasn‚Äôt been extensively tested on humans and the animal tests for this sort of thing didn‚Äôt go well;  in fact they skipped animal testing for these covid shots. It should be the normal and reasonable position to say these shots are an extreme risk especially on such a scale.

                Yes, and a traditional vaccine would introduce dead or attenuated virus that won‚Äôt in theory make you sick but still allow your immune system to develop antibodies.
Why the mRNA tech, I wonder. What is it about a coronavirus that a traditional vaccine was never developed? Do they mutate too quickly, or are they so common your immune system would go nuclear? And how would this tech, which sounds to me to be mimicking a virus, be an improvement?
Idk, rhetorical questions. Something about it all doesn‚Äôt sit right.

                    All the information has now been buried, but before this all started you could look up the history of developing a vaccine for coronaviruses like SARS. They spent a decade trying to develop vaccines for SARS and MERS with no luck. In agriculture they had more success, but the requirements and risk tolerance are different with livestock.Frankly, I think the drug companies just saw a chance to make billions fast tracking technology that they never could make work, but now they get paid billions to figure it out on the population. The pols like it because it advances their agenda to reengineer society, so everyone is happy.

                        I think that the purpose of the vaccine was to get the populace back to work before the Country was bankrupted by the panic. The government and experts couldn‚Äôt simply tell everyone to stop worrying, that the actual risk was far lower than initally believed because that would suggest they were wrong, one thing weak leaders cannot possibly ever admit to. Their problem is that having whipped up mass hysteria they now find they have no way of calming things down. On the whole watching the great and good floundering, and clearly out of their depth is most gratifying, not unlike watching one of the better episodes of Faulty Towers except the main characters are less sympathetic.

                    My understanding is there have never been corona virus vaccines because there are too many of them and they mutate too fast. These jabs aren‚Äôt traditional vaccines, it‚Äôd be much more honest to call them treatments. The jab pushers don‚Äôt even claim the shots prevent infection, they just lesson symptoms.Some of the shots are attenuated virus, such as Sinovac and Sputnik I believe, which for me really suggests there‚Äôs something to the claim that there is no virus. If coronavirus vaccines have never worked because they mutate so fast, what‚Äôs different about this one? And why are we in the west playing about with mRNA and micro-lipids are whatever when we just use the trusty attenuated virus? None of this makes sense and truly many of the more out there conspiracy theories make more sense than the scraps of official narrative we‚Äôre given.On one side you have known liars trying to ‚Äúsell‚Äù a product and on the other many people who have nothing to gain or lose but their credibility. Faucci can‚Äôt lose credibility because his is made up by the media and he has contradicted himself plenty of times and has a long record of seriously botching things, therefor it makes no sense to trust anything he or his friends say.

            I agree it‚Äôs possible that there is some harmful component of the vaccine. Either on purpose (conspiracy), or by accident (negligence).For normies though, I try and stay away from the conspiratorial aspects and focus on more concrete things. I might say something like ‚Äúthese companies told us that Oxy is ‚Äòsafe and not addictive‚Äô back in the 90s. Why would I trust them now?‚Äù Or bring up thalidomide.I also talk about how I don‚Äôt trust a rushed vaccine, or mention that things were supposed to go back to normal after they got vaccinated ‚Äì why are there new measures coming back?It‚Äôs easy to lose normies when you get into the tinfoil hat territory. And frankly those are much more solid arguments.

            If you accept the lab release conjecture, the original virus is almost certainly a synthetic virus, a product of gain of function or other types of investigation. Prior (published) research included making the SARS (or related) virus more infectious to humans, and to resist certain types of treatment. The preceding is established fact, years of published academic research including at Wuhan (WIV). Beyond that, it of necessity rapidly descends into the murk of unknowns and we only have circumstantial evidence. At the very least, SARS-CoV-2  (if a lab product) is almost certainly a nasty engineered research project that slipped the lead. A (hopefully) more remote possibility is that China was working on illegal bio-weapons. Especially based upon their continuing stonewalling of any outside investigation, this latter case cannot be dismissed. üôÅ

3.  Any further complaints about your changed DNA is racist.

        From the Taki column: ‚ÄúThe dominant theory for why revolutions always end in a bloodbath‚Ä¶‚ÄùThis gets said a lot ‚Äî a whole lot. But is it true? Sure, revolutions *sometimes* end in bloodbaths, but *always*? Really? There was a revolution in Portugal in the ‚Äô70s. It didn‚Äôt end in a bloodbath. There were a few revolutions in Brazil in the late 19th andearly through mid  20th centuries and none of them were spectacularly bloody.I am by no means a student of the history of revolution, but I bet there are dozens of counter examples to the ‚Äúalways ends in a bloodbath‚Äù claim.But there frequently seems to be this urge to paint revolution in terms of worst-case  scenarios.There have also been fairly peaceful secessions from and dissolutions of empires.

            I think it is how we use the term revolution. When I use it, I mean a new ruling system in addition to a new ruling elite. Latic revolutions tend to just replace the old rulers with some new ones. The system itself remains unchanged.

                Bloodbath revolutions require willing executioners, to use a phrase, in addition to the resentful intellectuals. Usually this requires a mass of peasantry who sees for the first time in generations the ability to move up in life by being the willing killers. Stalin and Lenin and the Committee did not get their hands dirty if I remember correctly. It is not enough for just resentful intellectuals like Bill Ayers and Patrice Cullors and Ibrahim X. Kendi to exist. There needs to be a critical mass of would be killers eager to enlist.So far the Regime has anti-Fa and BLM and the NFAC. That‚Äôs about it. Meanwhile White America has been arming itself since 1965 understanding in their bones what the elite have planned for them. The Holocaust cuts two ways ‚Äî there is likely few White men alive who cannot picture LeBron or Kendi or anti-Fa herding them to a mass grave site. I would agree that this rickety Regency is likely to go full Pol Pot at some point, get a lot of innocent and ordinary people killed. But ultimately fail the way Mustache Man failed due to lack of resources.

            This is a classic, along the same lines of the article he wrote about when he talked to a reactionary who he admitted was probably right about everything, and quickly purged the conversation from his memory because, while the reactionary was probably correct, his thoughts were BAD.

            Dreher has pulled this crap before.  For him to act like he barely knows Derb‚Äôs writing and hasn‚Äôt read him at all since Dreher left National Review 20 years ago is ridiculous.  I believe Dreher joined the pile on against Derb for ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù also.  There is no way he didn‚Äôt know about Unz Review.  He has admitted to reading Steve Sailer‚Äôs stuff.  I have made comments about VDare and Peter Brimelow in his comment section before, he knows what the site is about and that it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhite nationalist.‚Äù  The idea that this loser would be able to offer serious resistance to a totalitarian anti-Christian state is laughable.  All they have to do his threaten to label him with the scarlet R and he will prostrate himself at their feet.

                Well isn‚Äôt that his schtick? Offer no resistance to globohomo and try to have Christian communities? This is a subject I‚Äôm very interested in. I‚Äôm an Orthodox Christian (as is Dreher) and we have preserved monasticism and the life of the Faith since the beginning. But what‚Äôs missing is the martial aspect that conquered and maintained vast empires. What happened to all that? Did it ever exist or did Christendom conquer Europe despite the Church? Even the based clergy and laymen never talk about it; only monasticism.

                    Dreher had an insane, hysterical post about Covid in February at The American Conservative and from what I can tell hasn‚Äôt mentioned it on their website since.  His comments section ripped into him for it. I wonder if they banned him from writing posts about it after that. I wonder if his readership was starting to decline and that is part of the reason for the Orban fangirl posting.

        ‚ÄúThe main principle of the conservative is to conserve their reputation at all costs.‚ÄùFinally! We‚Äôve found what itdoesconserve!On the subject of Alex Jones‚Ä¶ how ought he to know? In the last year (and before, naturally) we‚Äôve seen immense whoppers told to us by those in power. And by those in science. I suppose Mr Jones could avail himself of a book on the technology behind the vaccine; but what are the prerequisites for him to even understand this? In short, I find Jones highly amusing and am glad he makes such noises, because it is another person saying ‚ÄúBalls to the ‚Äòscience‚Äô, I don‚Äôt want your jab!‚Äù.For me, it is enough to just say I don‚Äôt want it and I don‚Äôt need it. But how could I ever know what‚Äôs in it? How much do I trust official documentation of such a vaccine? Best to focus my intellect elsewhere. It‚Äôs also worth repeating that, as you‚Äôve mentioned with MacDonald, to them, we‚ÄôreallAlex Jone‚Äôs. We may as well be, doesn‚Äôt matter if you give the most ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô answer on Planet Earth; they don‚Äôt want to know us.As for science? I recently began reading a textbook on Geology, which is a fascinating field. But, as one would expect, it is packed with terms like ‚Äòprobably‚Äô, ‚Äòit is possible that‚Äô, ‚Äòquite certain‚Äô, ‚Äòit may have been the case that‚Äô, ‚Äòthe evidence suggests that‚Äô‚Ä¶ and so on. When you add the need for certainty that the MSM craves, and how many talentless sell-outs there are in science; the ground starts looking pretty shaky.That was always the hallmark of a great scientist; a humble, curious man burning with creativity. Willing to go against convention. The mass professionalization of science has turned it into one big exercise in credential accrual. A bit like the record protecting of professional boxing: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt face him, he may damage my neat little unbeaten run‚Äù.Anyway, to the point of the post, this snobbery between certain parts of what I guess we could call ‚ÄòThe Right‚Äô is very problematic. Ivory Tower Conservative Professor (ITCP) knows there is a problem. The problem can be remedied with fists. Bob talks highly of fists and organised action as a mechanism. Therefore, ITCP distances himself from Bob the bigot ‚Äì and probably writes anAtlanticpiece about his brush with extremism.

        The ‚Äúlibertarians‚Äù have just been appalling on the whole Covid issue. For a bunch of people who allegedly value freedom above everything else, they sure have been OK with supporting the most coercive government intrusions on personal freedom that we have seen in my lifetime. Not all libertarians have been like this but certainly most of the high-profile ones like Soave, MacDonald, and Balko (who, after a lifetime of ranting about abuse of police power, now wants them to be able to arrest you for not wearing a mask.). A lot of people have shown their true colors during this ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù and I for one will not forget.

            McDonald showed her true colors years ago.  She did an interview with Lana from Red Ice not realizing her and Henrick were ‚ÄúNotSees‚Äù.  If memory serves she publicly disavowed them and tried to get them to take down the interview. She‚Äôs not an ally.Off topic, for anyone who‚Äôs interested there is a particularly fine comment on Friday‚Äôs post made by Not My Usual Pen Name about the Holy Spirit which will probably go unseen since it was posted late.  Worth the effort to hunt it down for anyone interested in the topic.  And not entirely off topic since it involves the consequences of dishonoring The Truth, which we have been bathing in for the last 80 years.

        I have what I still believe is an eminently rational case against the ‚Äúvaccine.‚Äù It has nothing to do with ‚ÄúTeh Science ‚Ñ¢,‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt get my Twitter MD last spring, and anyway ‚ÄúTeh Science‚Äù changes daily. Instead, I based it on two things that can be observed by anyone, and about which there can be no reasonable doubt, given that we all experience both multiple times a day: the behavior of the government, and the behavior of The Media.Fascinating, isn‚Äôt it, that the kind of people who derided Obamacare as ‚Äúputting the DMV in charge of your health‚Äù are now the truest of true believers re: government health care. Also The Media. Remember when government health care‚Äôs newest BFFs were against it, so every day The Media ran stories about those eeeeeeeevil Big Pharma companies, and how they‚Äôd cackle with glee every time a child died because Single Mom didn‚Äôt get free antibiotics like they have in Canada?I swear, both of those things happened. Multiple times a day. For years. And yet, out of the blue, both sides do a complete 180, instantly, totally, like a school of bait fish. And they‚Äôre still doing it, every time The Narrative changes.Knowing all that ‚Äì and again, everyone sees this, all the time, every day ‚Äì why would I risk it? Seems to me there‚Äôs only one *reasonable* course of action.

            We give vaccines to children based on known risks. We stopped giving the smallpox vaccine because there is zero risk of getting smallpox. I‚Äôve never had a flu shot, because I have had the flu a few times in my life and it was a minor inconvenience. Since 95% of people have little to fear from Covid, mandatory vaccination is not warranted. Making it optional an encouraging people to consider it is reasonable.

                That‚Äôs the issue: Risk.What are the risks of the vaccine versus the risks of getting Covid?Obviously, some of the potential risks ‚Äì such as some long-term side effect that no one could have predicted ‚Äì of the vaccine are unknown, but it‚Äôs been in the equivalent of a stage three trial, a massive stage three trial, for around eight months so we‚Äôre probably getting a decent idea of its pros and cons.For someone over 60 or 70, the risks of Covid seem to dramatically outweigh the risks of the vaccine. For a health person under 25, it‚Äôs likely the other way around. (The chance of heart issues, though extremely rare, seem to much higher than the chance of hospitalization from Covid, which is astonishingly rare for that age group.)If the medical establishment was honest about these facts, and a few are such as Marty Makary, people might trust them. The problem is that the media, the government and the medical establishment have exaggerated or flat out lied throughout this whole thing so no one believes them anymore.Regardless, the vaccine should be voluntary. If it has any efficacy at all, the vaccinated will be protected so they shouldn‚Äôt care if some people choose to not get it.

                    The other issue is we know something about the arc of coronaviruses. The Russian flu a century ago was a coronavirus. Nasty at first, then progressively les nasty. It is still with us today, as the common cold. We are seeing this now, so the need for the vaccine declines with each mutation.

                        Exactly. The Delta variant is more contagious but less deadly, which is what you‚Äôd expect.
Granted, the lower deaths are partially explained by the first wave taking out a lot of the vulnerable, the vaccines reducing the symptoms and doctors knowing how to treat the virus better. But still, the deaths relative to the case is dramatically lower.

                Certainly ‚Äúmaking it optional and encouraging people to consider it‚Äù is reasonable. But that‚Äôs not what they did. First it was ‚Äúvaccines are totally unsafe because Drumpf and his Big Pharma buddies etc.‚Äù Then, once the election was successfully stol‚Ä¶err, I mean,normalized,Climate Science-style, it became ‚Äúvaccines are great; they‚Äôre 100% safe and 100% effective.‚Äù And when that narrative was rendered inoperative, it became ‚Äúthe only reason vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% safe and effective is because of all the mouth-breathing conspiracy theorists who refuse to take them.‚Äù And now, soon enough, it will be mandatory.It has all been completely binary, right from the get go.

Why no, it doesn‚Äôt suddenly explode in your pocket, and all those cases of people coming into the ER with scorched crotches are just misinformation pushed by Alex Jones types.

                    Making it optional will not work because wherever the plebs perceive the risk to be low, take up of vaccine will be low and it can have no effect on infection rates, (it may have no effect whatever the vaccination rate.) . If they try to scare us into being vaccinated that just exacerbates the panic, which is the last thing the idiots want. On the other hand any attempt at coercion generates massive pushback. All in all I‚Äôm loving watching our halfwit PM Johnson, all the other political clowns, media numpties and assorted experts make complete arses of themselves.

                In no way are these vaccines in any conventional sense. Therapeutics are a far more accurate description. And the side effect profile that we are seeing in Israel and Iceland demonstrates that these so-called vaccines need far more study before any mass application. I‚Äôm actually surprised you are buying into any of this pro vaccine nonsense at this point. You have a blindspot here. The critics of these vaccines occupy the intellectual high ground at this point. Very high ground

                We do not give children, and especially infants, vaccines based on known risks. We give them shots based on a control pattern designed for the lowest common denominator.  If your child will be a low-iq, impulsive, drug-using pervert degenerate, the recommended child vaccine schedule is for you!The cdc shot schedule begins at &lt;1 week, most are done before 5 years.  What do you think the incidence and severity of Hepatitis B is in 1 year olds? Exactly zero in the developed world. Yet it is the first shot given.

        &gt;  It is very important to someone like Mx. MacDonald to never be associated with someone like Alex Jones, who thinks vaccines are making frogs gay and lowering the sperm count of American males.Most people who pride themselves on being a purely reasonable commentator would rather be respected than be right.  The ‚ÄúConservative Pundit‚Äù account took this to hilarious extremes, then the parody became real so fast it became impossible to keep up.The problem is, these people have an effect on keeping midwits in the right on the plantation at a more personal level, and murders any solidarity that could develop.  Everyone reading this forum has probably dealt with a harpy like Ms Macdonald in their day to day life who would gleefully stab you in the back while pontificating on being on your side.   Demoralizing as hell.

                It‚Äôs obvious that, politics aside, some of these people are just sh*t-terrified of Covid, to an unreasonable degree. You can give a pass to some of the older people with health problems (naming no names here, but we all know who we mean), and for younger guys like Yarvin who have or had family members who had serious health problems (I had no idea how sick his poor wife was until she passed recently*) but for young, healthy people like Soave, MacDonald, and Balko, it‚Äôs just absurd. If you want to get vaccinated, get vaccinated; but don‚Äôt suddenly go all communitarian on us after a lifetime of ‚ÄúMuh Freedomz‚Äù preaching just because the bad pictures on the TV scared you.*By the way, props to Yarvin/Moldbug for not even mentioning his wife‚Äôs illness until she passed. I disagree with CY about lots, but that was admirable and old school of him. You know that, if this happened to Dreher or George Will, you would be hearing ‚ÄúAs I was saying to my brave, terminally ill wife last night‚Äù every damned column.

        I don‚Äôt know the backstory, but she does the Pretentious Scotswoman thing of putting a space in the punctuation of her surname, ‚ÄúMac Donald.‚Äù Perhaps she is honoring her ancestors who were the producers of ‚ÄúMac and Me‚Äù
