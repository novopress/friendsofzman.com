        One observation from living among the cosmopolitan elites, both right and left, for decades is the degree to which both want to desperately forget their more ‚Äúcommon‚Äù roots.   Around here people were shocked that guy like JD Vance, who‚Äôd made it in Silicon Valley was willing to actually write about his Appalachian family or acknowledge they were anything other than an impediment to his success.  Ditto for the second or third generation descendants of immigrants.   They ascribe no value to work ethic, sense of community or identity in their new role as ‚Äúglobal citizens‚Äù.  It‚Äôs funny to watch someone cringe when I disclose most of my family were what I call ‚Äúflatland hillbillies‚Äù from the Midwest.  Hard working, often self educated, took care of their own and ruthlessly fought every war in this country‚Äôs history (and before).

            I‚Äôve experienced this my whole adult life. I make no effort to pretend I‚Äôm anything but lower-class. The people I‚Äôm most often around are baffled and irritated by it. I see this even among people on our side. It‚Äôs not the old class divide. It‚Äôs more shame, I think, than anything else. Maybe a false sense of self or self-delusion. Perhaps some of all of it.

                Ditto.  Shame seems a part.  I‚Äôve experienced this in others from meager backgrounds.  I‚Äôve never experienced this, thankfully.  Actually, I‚Äôm fairly proud of where I came from and where I am now.  I tout my life travel as the true and lasting promise of America.  This is why I am so very sorry to see it under such challenge.  As the old saw goes, ‚ÄúMerica has bean berry, berry, gud to me!‚Äù  üòâ

                Disagree kinda. This whole ‚Äúclass‚Äù thing is a European hangover from the Middle Ages. It‚Äôs alien to the American ethic where normal people see ‚Äúclass‚Äù in terms of personal characteristics. You can be an educated, rich, elite cosmopolitan and still be a piece of shit (e.g. certain politically powerful American families). And you can be a decent respectable person whether you‚Äôve got money or ‚Äústatus‚Äù or not; these types are not generally famous, but are respected as ‚Äústand-up people‚Äù in their communities. Thus ‚Äúclass‚Äù in America isn‚Äôt connected with either wealth or heredity; it‚Äôs more about ‚Äúwhat you are and what you do.‚Äù

                        miforest, I don‚Äôt normally watch youtube clips, but that one was well worth it.
Folks, it‚Äôs a review of the full-poz propaganda ‚ÄúNorma Rae‚Äù.
Religion is indeed the stories we tell, or are told, about ourselves.Class and connectedness- social standing- depends on those stories.

                When people in our neighborhood think of George Orwell, they generally think of ‚Äú1984‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnimal Farm‚Äù ‚Äî which is not wrong, because those books are crucial to understanding politics.
But people should also read ‚ÄúThe Road to Wigan Pier‚Äù, which is a very important but more subtle book about class issues.  It is not directly relevant to our situation in the US, because our class system simply is not remotely the same as 1930s Britain, but it‚Äôs full of human insight and great quotable lines.  Sometimes you learn things thru differential comparison.

                    Wigan Pier is wonderful.  I found it interesting to substitute Race for Class and apply to the current US situation.  Not a match but enlightening.

                My mother is desperate that none of her children ever appear working class. She thinks that by listening to NPR and aping the behaviors of what the ‚Äòelite‚Äô signal people to be will somehow get her kids into to the better class of people. Her and her sisters grew up *dirt* poor and all are similar ‚Äì now they‚Äôre ‚Äúupper middle class‚Äù (some are even ‚Äòupper class‚Äô doctors/executives etc). Very few of them will ever talk about growing up in midwestern rural poverty.This drives me crazy. Working in soul-crushing ‚Äòenterprise‚Äô fortune 500 companies, I see first hand the children of wealth who get moved into middle management even though they are often idiots. Corporate America is basically a babysitting service for the kids of the elites and those right-thinkers one rung down the ladder. It‚Äôs one of the reasons they‚Äôre pushing to bring in Pajeet ‚Äì the smart white engineer kids of working class parents who were the first to get a college degree back in 1980-2000 are now questioning their betters.

                    Your last paragraph hit the nail on the head. Few people understand the damage done to America by the executive training grounds of companies like AT&amp;T and General Electric. Their executive training system spawned executives who spread across the corporate landscape like locusts, destroying everything they touched. Karly Fiorina is a case-in-point, but by no means the worst of the bunch.

                I remember years ago seeing a CNN story on Southerners taking classes to lose their accents. Not learning a stronger vocabulary or better syntax but ‚Äúlearning to speak like the people on TV‚Äù. Sure there are some twangy less pleasant southern sub-accents but I guess since I grew up surrounded by Southerners I enjoy the sound.
I‚Äôve never met a person from the Bronx, Boston, or Newark that tried to lose their accents and to me those sound like donkeys braying.

                        Another Dave,I understand. When I came to California in middle school one of the teachers pulled me aside and suggested I lose my southern accent and drop the ‚ÄúSir‚Äù and ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam‚Äù when responding to teachers (a near capital offense in 1980s Louisiana).I eventually did and sound like TV people now but if I get excited or extremely angry my southern can flood back out unconsciously.As an aside, I dated a Boston girl from Dedham (pronounced like ‚ÄúAhm from Dawd‚Äôem nee‚Äôah Bawst‚Äôn Moss‚Äù). Straight up Italian working class with a sailor‚Äôs colorful vocabulary. Sweet girl actually with an amazing figure‚Ä¶ just couldn‚Äôt get that godawful accent to stop grating in my brain.

                    Penitent Man:  I, unfortunately, still have an east coast accent (grew up in DC burbs) . . . and too many here in Texas seem to think any east coast accent equals New Yawk (which I‚Äôve visited twice and HATED).  If money were no object, I would take classes to lose my east coast accent in a heartbeat!   To my east coast relatives my accent has faded, but it‚Äôs still identifiably alien to others here.

Oops. In the interest of backpedaling üòÅ‚Ä¶ I like the laconic cadence of Maine accents and some of the smaller New England states aren‚Äôt that bad, Marylanders even have a slightly southern feel to some of their speech. That Jersey/NYC sound just lands rough in my ear canal.
Sorry for any offense, Sister.

                The lower and middle class bring salt to the meal. A big part of our problem is the success of the lower class whites in the last 50 years moving into the upper classes and instead of giving something back and teaching their children responsibilities many of us whites have acted like a gangbanger who just got an NFL contract.Bring on the gold chains and hookers and forget about our own people and communities where we came from.Stan Kronke is a prime example. Grow up in the lower class in Missouri. Become a billionaire. Move to a sunny location. Sell out your native state and move your NFL team out of the Midwest to the better gold fields of LA.Our new elite whites. They are a great part of our problems.

                Interesting. I haven‚Äôt seen that much, but people do seemed surprised by my very lower middle class childhood. They just assume that I grew up upper middle class because I look and act like them.
But as I tell my kids, you get a certain understanding of life when as a child, you ask your mother to buy some more lunch meat and she says that we‚Äôll get more food at the end of the month when she gets paid. I never went hungry, but I could see the shelves getting emptier. I‚Äôve never been proud or ashamed of that.

                I come from a working class background but moved up the educational and financial ranks. When I am talking with a smug NPC who views the rabble as fools and bigots, I like to tell them that because I come from a working class background, I can‚Äôt join the left in hating and wanting to destroy the working class nor can I view providing cheap labor for oligarchs as the greatest human rights issue of the day.This leaves them speechless. They can‚Äôt reconcile their hatred of the working class and their alinement with the oligarchs with their self image as a champion of the people. They really want to be seen as speaking truth to power (while gaining status from the powerful) and opposing hate.It won‚Äôt change them but it shuts them up for awhile

            What you‚Äôre getting at was probably one of the driving forces( excluding diversity)of the white migration to California from the 50s to the 90s. You could escape being a mill town Polack, Canuck, Mick, Wop, etc.  Now you could reinvent yourself as a Californian.  The past was erased. The present was defined by the future.  A future defined by illusions, flights of fancy and a denial of everything that made you, you.

                ‚ÄúPersonal Reinvention‚Äù has always been touted as an American thing.  Why needing to crap all over your roots needs to be part of it, I‚Äôve never quite understood.

                Yves ‚Äì little related tidbit.  When researching genealogy (hubby‚Äôs maternal side is Italian), I read about a large group of returning WWII vets who left a northern Massachusetts mill town due to housing shortages, etc., and set out for California en mass.  These were the American-born children (in some cases grandchildren) of Italian immigrants who worked street labor, construction, in mills, etc.  Their first letters back home were full of wonder at the terrific climate, the open spaces, etc.  In short, their experience encapsulates precisely what you‚Äôre saying about California.

            This comment will out me if any of my acquaintances read this blog, but what the hell. I come from dirt people. Literally.My father‚Äôs family were depression era on scrappy land in rural Iowa. They raised five boys and one girl, although one boy died at age 7. All 4 boys served in the military 3 graduated college. The farm is still in the family.My mother‚Äôs father owned a grain truck and made his living hauling corn and other crops from farm to market. Although dirt poor, they raised 10 kids, who in turn produced around 30 grandkids.I grew up in rural Iowa as well, working on farms and other odd jobs in high school. All those jobs we boys did in high school‚Äìmilking cows, bailing hay, walking beans, detassling corn, etc., are gone‚Äìeither mechanized or now done by illegal immigrants who now do the work Americans won‚Äôt do, like murdering Mollie Tibbets.Proud to be of the dirt. Still a big fan of Charles Grassley, the only Senator who still goes home to harvest crops in the fall and a man of great integrity. In a better country Grassley would be a front-runner for President.

                Filled in on de-tasseling crews for some of my cousins in the summer.  Tough work, though I think sterile hybrids pretty much wiped out the need.  But the toughest work I ever did was ridding one of his soybean fields of a weed called ‚Äúbutterprint‚Äù that was resistant to any herbicide.  Had to get it all before flowering and used long handled weeding forks he‚Äôd fashioned in the shop.  He was 73 I was twelve and he ran me ragged.  My favorite job was tending an old steam tractor that he and a friend owned and ran in parades.  I was responsible for getting a wood fire going until enough steam came up to run the blower and start burning coal.  Loved that thing.

            When somebody I trust asks me about my politics, I sometimes say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a demographic conservative.‚Äù
It takes a few seconds, but then the lightbulb goes off over their head: ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs one ofthoseguys.‚Äù
It seems like a pretty good term for those, like myself, who harbor dreams of reclaiming the word ‚Äúconservative,‚Äù like a verbal version of capture the flag, from the scummy thieves who took it from us.

        The authentic alternative to this is not a slightly different ideology, but the rejection of ideology as the foundation of politics.Amen, brother. The whole thing now is shifting politics away from ideology and towards tribe.I have a sort of fever-fantasy that one day the prime minister or president of a white country takes the podium for his inaugural speech, and opens with, ‚Äúin the evaluation of any policy, we only have to ask one simple question:is it good for the whites?‚ÄùOf course, that‚Äôs not going to happen. But if it did, I would be willing to sell my house, donate all the money to his party, and spend the rest of my life as a wandering political proselytizer on his behalf.

            Babe:  Amen.  While that‚Äôs highly unlikely in my lifetime, we can each live our lives according to that precept, to the best of our ability.  When hiring, hire White.  When consuming, try to consume White and/or local ‚Äì or at least the less pozzed company.  In many cases all the choices are bad, and we all have to make some compromises to survive in the current environment, but whenever there is a choice or any wiggle room, choose one‚Äôs own.I get the appeal of the Salvation Army and that many have been helped by them, but when I see an Asian bell ringer or whatever, I‚Äôm reminded that they take primarily White people‚Äôs money and give it to everyone else.  Don‚Äôt let your wife buy candy bars or whatever from the mystery-meat doorbell ringers.  Don‚Äôt support the Boy Scouts (who now have entirely ‚Äògirl‚Äô troops) or the Girl Scouts (who‚Äôve been in bed with radical feminism and Planned Parenthood forever).  Put your own first.  Then you may help whoever else you wish, with you own dime.

        ‚ÄúUnder Corbyn‚Äôs watch, Labour became a party in which anti-Semitism started to have free rein.‚Äù Yeah, that‚Äôs what caused millions to vote Tory.My cynical (and perhaps too J‚Äôs-under-the-bed) interpretation is the ‚Äúelites‚Äù knew early that the Conservatives were going to win. So they framed the election as a referendum on anti-Semitism.So that when the Conservatives won, they could say, ‚Äúsee, the country has soundly rejected anti-Semitism!‚Äù And push the anti-BDS stuff, which Johnson is already championing (*sigh*).When in fact, what people werereallyvoting for was Brexit‚Äìand Brexit itself had originally functioned a proxy for anti-immigration sentiment.But the shitlibs have becomereallygood at dishonest framing. They‚Äôve been doing it, unpunished, for such a long time. And the scumbags might get away with it again.

            The elites don‚Äôt like left-wing extremists because they make it hard to keep the sandwich together.

        The amusing thing is how close Boris actually is to the cosmopolitan conservatives. He was one of the first on the gay bandwagon for starters. Now that he‚Äôs won he‚Äôs announced plans to make it illegal for public groups to participate in the BDS sanction against Israel. Granted it was a Labor power ploy, but you wonder who‚Äôs pulling the strings.He‚Äôs also big into climate change and wants an Aussie style immigration system. As an Aussie all I can say to that is, good luck and good night, Britain.What all this means is that Boris is in it for Boris. I hope that he proves me wrong but I remain unconvinced. Of course he‚Äôs vastly preferable to the tottering socialist that he defeated, but I‚Äôm not sure how good he‚Äôs going to be.

            I‚Äôm not sure that is the worst thing. Boris is a megalomaniac. He now has a chance to remake Britain. He may not believe in much of anything, but he believes there should be a statue of him in every town. That‚Äôs not happening with half measures and doing things the old way.
We‚Äôll see, but the prerequisite to all national debates in Britain is Brexit. Unless they regain their sovereignty, everything else is moot.

                Britain is done and dusted.  They stand idly by while their children (what few of them they have left) are raped and pimped by foreign monkeymen.  They allow foreign monkeymen to occupy their capital.  They allow mosques, which are in fact victory totems signifying conquest, to be erected on their soil.  They have lost all vestiges of self-respect.  They are finished as a people.

                    Fertility is about the same as the US and depending on the studies is higher especially looking at white numbers.More white women and children get raped(per capita) each year in the US than the UK.UK white pop is at US levels from the 80s.Mosques- only the UK has mosques!Only the UK has  immigrants in in its capital!By pretty much every social metric the US is worse than the UK. You are a nation of fat suicidal junkies. You have been chased out of your most populous and wealthiest state. Whole swathes of your cities are ,and have been for decades, no-go zones. Your leaders openly despise you and one president had a habit of making explicitly racist remarks about ‚Äútypical white people‚Äù. All of the PC hate has come from your country. Affirnmative action, Transgenderism, Post-colonial studies, all of it the rich bounty of American Exceptionalism. And what do people like you do? Nothing but project your failure, your cowardice, onto foreigners whose countries ,using your metrics, are not nearly as ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù as your own.‚ÄúThey have lost all vestiges of self-respect. ‚Äù  The lack of self-awareness on your part is impressive.‚ÄúThey are finished as a people‚Äù- apply this argument to your people(if you have any).Merkins never, never shall be.(Smiles patronizingly at retard spitting in front of him.)

            ‚Äúplane ticket to China‚ÄùSo there‚Äôs this Chinese folk story about creating a monster by putting all manner of venomous creatures (serpent, scorpion, spider, etc) into a big jar and burying that jar for a few weeks.Then you dig up the jar, and the survivor (which has eaten its ‚Äúcell mates‚Äù) is the nastiest, meanest, most vicious creature that you then sic on your enemy.I dunno why I mentioned that. It is a headscratcher and puzzlement. Must be going senile. Can‚Äôt possibly have anything to do with Jews vs Chinese. Two relatively high-IQ groups with continuous identities stretching back millennia, who are incredibly chauvinistic and consider all others not of their group as less than human ‚Ä¶ hmmmm.

        The cosmoservatives think the people will assimilate by cosmosis.But there are two strange and mutually contradictory thoughts about bringing more minorities, e.g. blacks, into cosmoservatism.1. the Libertarian style nonsense that if they just read the right book or were presented with the right argument that they would instantly be converted to the creed.2. Give aways, concessions, and going as full socialist, interventionist, reject as many principles as necessary to get their vote.  But ONLY for them ‚Äì gay marriage but not covenant (old before no-fault divorce) rules.  Giveaways to women but not men.  Concessions like criminal justice reform for Blacks and Latinx, not whites.Creative destruction, dog-eat-dog, free market rat race survial of the fittest for white men who follow Christian ethics or Jesus Christ, full on socialism for blacks, women, immigrants including illegals, Jews, Muslims, perverts, etc.The thing is Whites are already converted on both points, they believe in the creed of thrift and work, and (ack!) morals and a few laws for the evil and stupid, yet also note that as long as we aren‚Äôt enforcing the rules, and living under a foreign creed, we need to play by those rules, not the imaginary abstract rules ‚Äì We need to play by China‚Äôs rules when dealing with China, the ‚Äúbrowning‚Äù is visible on the sidewalks of San Francisco, and why is it now the 6th generation of inner city blacks have a kid, get a check when taxpayers have to pay for their own kids and health care?

        What will drive Dan Crenshaw from the temple?  It‚Äôll be a socialist Latina in a rapidly browning Houston metro area.  Guess what Dan?  I already saw the movie in 1980s LA, I know how it ends.   We‚Äôre about to have a lot of these material socialistic Latinas in Congress.  As the demographic tidal wave rips through the country, these people will fall by the wayside.  this is what fascinates me about the Republican party.  Even in the 90s I was saying to myself, well, these old boomers just need to disappear, and the younger crowd will remake the party into something relevant.  It‚Äôs like the boomers hand picked the small sliver of younger generations who parrot exactly what they say.  So there‚Äôs no growth at all.  Perpetually 1986 in GOP land.  Like the movie Hot Tub Time Machine.  That party really needs to me mowed down.

        The conundrum for those of us who live away from or are trying to step away from the right-wing cosmopolitanism, is that it demands a race-aware return to families, communities, child bearing and child raising.  White women hear the footsteps of all of this in the background, but they have been trained and schooled to ignore it in favor of ‚Äùempowerment‚Äù and such things, translating to workplace quotas, equality in all things, and ‚Äúindependence‚Äù, especially financial independence (which typically entails some version of inheritance, divorce proceeds, or marrying money).  They have lost the language and concept of traditional family formation.  Even the Hallmark channel, as close to traditional as exists in the mainstream, is not about families.  It is about unconnected women finding that hunk of a man who can split wood and provide her with a cozy country home.For we men, even trying to have the conversation, when the women are defensive and have lost the language of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù, means that going there is essentially a non-starter.  Especially for the 80% of us who are not the handsome ones, MGTOW becomes the alternative.It is now a ‚Äúchicken or egg‚Äù conundrum, as we have lost the context and language by which the conversation can be had.  Japan and Europe have lost the thread in their own places as well, in their own ways.  Then you have Latin America, where the men ship out and send money back home.  The only broadly practiced family formation and support is, ironically, in the Muslim places, where the point of it, for many mothers, is to send their sons off to battle.

            Dutch,As I‚Äôve said before, I‚Äôm good at seeing patterns but lousy at connecting the why‚Äôs. Almost all of the younger men returning from the Wars seem to start families (real ones with actual little humans popping out of mom instead of ‚Äúfurry children‚Äù). At least in my observations, they are marrying and producing offspring at a far greater rate than others their age.If this is a correct observation I‚Äôm not clear on the why. Is it because they‚Äôve tasted mortality vs. their peers worrying about the latest gadget? Started adulthood earlier vs. stagnating in fake college-world? Got a jump on entering a wage-earning work world? They tend to come from more traditional or conservative backgrounds?

                My best guess is ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù.  IMO it is important to keep in mind that all of the positive and negative cultural influences are not singular in their effects.  Instead, there is a mosaic of influences, any one of which incrementally supports or tears down a productive way to live one‚Äôs life.
Active duty military wives are a distinct culture.  The combination of structure and discipline seem to create a different, more old-school approach to family-building, and they certainly inhabit a well-defined and specific community, complete with peer support and a shared culture and values.

On its face it seems like they are also marrying more quickly and frequently after military service as well.

        Are you sure Boris is not a cosmopolitan himself? He went to an elite university, is part Jewish part Turkish (and proud about these things), and is very limp wristed on the question of reducing immigration.
Sure, Brexit is good but cutting mass immigration is the most important. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre in the EU or nor, the source of immigrants will just change to Indians and other ‚ÄúCommonwealth‚Äù people ‚Äì which is probably worse than Africans and other refugees in the EU free movement zone.

            Boris is terrible on most things. He is a megalomaniac who wants to remember as the man who made Brexit happen. That‚Äôs as good as it gets at the moment. Keep in mind that Brexit is a prerequisite for all other nationalist issues. If Brexit goes through and it is successful, then it becomes possible to talk about national questions again.

                    Brexit shifts the debate in ways I think most of these guys don‚Äôt get. They just look at the superficial aspects. The Remain side does get this and that is why they are so passionate, but their passion frightens normal white Britains.

                    I wonder how long after the Scots join the Irish, in trying to suckle the European Union-teet, before they realize they aren‚Äôt considered continentals. They dont have the social volatility the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards have and are less likely to obtain the squeaky wheel oil the Southern Europeans get when they act up.The sun countries of Europe all have had histories of being client states of the greater European powers. Thusly, they have l an ingrained mindset of demanding ‚Äútheir share‚Äù from whichever power currently holds the reigns.The Scottish and Irish are new to the gibs game (though Scotland has done well recently in being an economic drain on England) and their rebellious nature lies historically with an independence mindset rather that demanding succour.It‚Äôll be interesting to see, when the diminished dole is shared out by the French and the Germans, who gets shorted because they wouldn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt squeak loud enough.

                Brexit is the British shorthand for all sorts of unspoken things.  Here, impeachment, to some degree, serves a similar purpose.  In both cases, the spoken-of thing stops becoming relevant as a series of details and complexions, but simply becomes a shorthand for all-the-things that are forbidden and too delicate to lay out in detail.  It is heartening that both Brexit and impeachment are going ‚Äúour‚Äù way, though what we will actually see as a result of the resolution of either or both is probably not much, in the real world.

            Does it matter?   Many voted for Brexit because they believed regaining sovereignty would lead to reductions in immigration (legal, illegal and refugee resettlement.)   Boris has already said there will be no caps.   What difference does it make if you lose your country legally?

                Getting free of EU laws would seem like a necessary starting point, and the Brexiteers were wise to not let later goals interfere with the immediate goal.Most actual British people have got to want to drive out as many immigrants as possible ‚Äì it‚Äôs only natural to gag when a shit sandwich is forced into you. They may not be willing to openly admit it, or even quite willing to admit it to themselves (after much indoctrination), but I‚Äôm sure they are aware of the NEED, at some level.I think the madness will break at some point, and when it does, it will break with a bang. They‚Äôve tried the path of excessive tolerance, they‚Äôve tried suppressing dissent to the point of state-sanctioned violence and legal double standards.~‚ÄùAt any time, most of the people are sane and want the normal things ‚Äù ‚Äì like survival, dignity, rule of law. The revulsion against the rule of the insane, stupid, immoral and psychopathic will reach an acute point -and I think it will reverse VIOLENTLY when the left no longer sees power, profit and safety from their perennial abuse of the normals.

                It‚Äôs  an interesting idea that there has literally been no progress regarding Brexit.I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true. Working class Britons flleeing Labour is a non-trivial effect. Certain topics which were verboten are going to be a core part of explicit British politics.The fact Brexit hasn‚Äôt been killed off is  important and reminds me of the French protests. When you take on the elite there‚Äôs going to be huge pushback and you will have to keep grinding away for years. Enduring the process requires a massive amount of sincere support. Compare and contrast with the collapse of the Tea party.Your meme is a false analogy. Analogies can be used to illustrate an idea established through reasoned argument. Analogies are not subsitutes for arguments.

        ‚ÄúIt is a form of Stockholm syndrome.‚ÄùPrecisely. When I divorced myself from the New York Times back in the early nineties, I noticed that others of similar political persuasion were still reading (and quoting) from it. As time has passed, the people who have continued in thrall to whatever crap they read in the NYTimes (or see on TV‚Ä¶same thing, really), as I say, the ones who continue in thrall have passed over into another political dimension. How these poor ‚Äúconservative‚Äù devils decide who to vote for is a mystery to me. They must be tortured souls these days. I certainly hope so.

            Yep. that‚Äôs what happened in CA. The CA GOP sold out in the end. They embraced Globo-homo in the form Carly Fiorina and Meh Whitman and the party never recovered.  Brown should have never been elected but the GOP went out of it‚Äôs way to rum a horrible candidate that had no appeal.Hell, prior to Trump the National GOP was already dead. McConnell and Ryan already had a slew of legislation ready for Hillary to sign including Amnesty and TPP.  That‚Äôs how far gone the GOP is. When Trump took over, McConnell bottled up over 200 pieces of House GOP legislation to keep Trump from having any legislative success.The GOP needs to die along with it‚Äôs supporters.

                    Buckley lived through Vatican II and was less than pleased.  For all his faults, he seems to make sense on this topic.  He posited that the switch to vernacular was intended to relieve the mystery of a Latin Mass and render the Gospels understandable to the laity. However, he said, reading them ‚Äî or reciting them, as it were ‚Äî in one‚Äôs native languageipso factodid nothing to increase the congregant‚Äôs understanding of of the liturgy.  He felt that time spent at a Latin Mass pondering the mystery of God and His teachings was replaced by mindless repetition of prayers and choreographed standing, sitting, and kneeling, in much the same way one sings along to the radio and drums his fingers on the steering wheel while driving down the road.  Perhaps that just Bill being a curmudgeon, but it‚Äôs an interesting proposition.During the late 30‚Äôs, Thomas Merton, before entering the Cistercian Order, taught at the Franciscan St. Bonaventure University in upstate NY.  He wrote in his autobiography about being able to take communion each morning before classes, in a roughly 10 minute version of Mass.  That‚Äôs a concept that in today‚Äôs world should be investigated and possibly promoted.  I don‚Äôt want the folk guitar rubbish during Mass, nor do I want the dowager aunts glaring at me from the lectern while they give the readings.  I just want a priest to deliver to me the sacrament and a reminder to focus on God‚Äôs presence in our world.

                    Benedict‚Äôs abdication is not without precedent and ‚ÄúBefore the 20th century, canon law existed in various forms and collections. It was not brought together into one book until 1917. The current Code of Canon Law, published in 1983, was a revision of the 1917 code. Some provisions for the resignation of a pope existed in older forms of the law (in the 13th century Pope Boniface VIII declared: ‚ÄòOur predecessor, Pope Celestine . . . constituted and decreed that the Roman Pontiff can freely resign. . . . we have determined . . . that it be placed among other constitutions for a perpetual memory of the same‚Äô). According to the current Code, a pope may resign validly as long as he makes the decision freely (canon 332.2) and makes it known in writing or orally in the presence of at least two cardinals of the church who serve as witnesses (see canon 189.2-4). This Benedict did.‚ÄùBededict is the first to abdicate under modern Canon law and Francis is Pope, like him or not.  Which I don‚Äôt.https://vocationnetwork.org/en//blog/questions_catholics_ask/2013/02/how_can_the_pope_resignEven if Francis is a heretic, he‚Äôs still Pope.https://onepeterfive.com/is-francis-the-pope/Unless, of course, Benedict was threatened or coerced into resignation, which may not be outside the realm of possibility.  You would have to prove it, though.  You can‚Äôt just pull some ‚Äúfacts‚Äù out of God knows where to make it happen.

No doubt that gays have infiltrated the Church. They cling to the free ride the same way they cling to wealthy aging white women. But most are decent men answering a deep calling with great sacrifice. I‚Äôm not saying the Catholic Church should do anything other than root out practicing homosexuals, pedophiles and heretical progressive clerics though. That should be mission number one. An Inquisition is in order.

Yes ma‚Äôam this. The Latin Mass given by a SSPX priest is one of the most transcendent ceremonies I can speak of. The humility that you are there to worship your Creator and not shuck and jive or peacock for other congregants.
As to the Faux-Pope. Heart and soul agree with you.

        If you don‚Äôt care about people but only about ideology, you are saying ideas are more important than humans. If you are hermit living alone with your stamp collection or train tables or whatever, that probably means you are autistic. But if you are sociable, it means you are a psychopath.

        Elites, regardless of their political orientation are elitists; they truly believe they are superior in every way to ordinary folks, the unwashed masses.‚ÄúConservative‚Äù elites just like leftist, progressive, Stalinist elites (e.g., democrat party members) feel compelled to direct the show and the only difference betwixt the two is that leftists will easily and readily utilize  all methods to achieve this goal , including mass murder and exterminations, whereas conservatives will not pursue that path (at least in the USA or other advanced western representative democracies.)So, in this latter regard, conservative elites have some actual moral fiber that puts a limit on their actions.Leftists have no such limits; after all they are perusing policies for ‚Äúour own good,‚ÄùThe British TV series Poldark , which takes place in about the 1790‚Äôs UK , ( well before a guy named Karl Marx was born) in one of their episodes illustrated the elitist mind-set when a hi-fallutin member of society and House of Commons (or was is Lords?) lectured the upstart  commoner, Poldark, that it was incumbent upon the ruling classes (i.e., the elites)  to rule because the ‚Äúlower‚Äù classes did not have the intelligence, education, moral fiber, wealth, you name it‚Ä¶. ‚Ä¶.to rule or even to participate in ruling a nation.After all, the masses couldn‚Äôt even conduct their own lives and affairs in an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù manner, so how could they be expected to govern a nation?Of course, in those days all ruling class members were ‚Äúconservative.‚ÄùOne can always differ, as conservatives, what should be the proper role of govt.For Stalinist‚Äôs  (i.e., progressives, democrats) no differences exist as to the proper role of govt, for their political theology demands an Orewllian 1984 society in which everybody (excepting the ruling elites) conforms to The Borg.And if the masses resist, and they always do, well, then all means must be utilized to compel the masses to conform.

        Instead of the hard and unseen work, NWL cat ladies get to play dress up, buy nice clothes, and work in cool offices.
Women- not just moms- don‚Äôt get to be seen, or commiserate, or share tips on the often disappointing work of family-neighborhood.
Modernity has devalued not only the labor of men, but of women as well.
Millions have no meaningful recognition of what they do.  We are cold, isolated, and disconnected.  We need to bring back fish markets.

Women don‚Äôt defend territory.They run and find a man when they see an invader.
Our cat ladies, with naught to do, have been given cool dress-up jobs preventing the men from defending real society.
Real society is: men build it, and women hold it together.
That‚Äôs what HR compliance lawfare is designed to prevent-  men defending this ummah of natural neighborhoods.

        For me, the big takeaway from this election is not Brexit but the Issue That Dare Not Speak it‚Äôs Name. I‚Äôm taking about the demographics ‚Äì that thing that nobody in Britain dare even notice let alone discuss.But, if you look at an electoral map of the UK, its screaming at you. All the big city/urban centres went for the Labour Party plus a few university towns, i.e. the vibrancy plus students.However, nearly all of the white middle and working class constituencies broke for Johnson. Many of them are (or were) safe Labour seats and, in some cases, had never returned a Conservative to parliament before last week.Funny thing is, though, it‚Äôs the lefties that get it. Since Friday they‚Äôve been hammering away on social media calling the entire nation ‚Äúracist, nazi, bigoted vermin‚Äù. It‚Äôs quite glorious to behold.

        [‚Ä¶] The British election offers a good opportunity to see the detachment of official conservatism from the people they pretend to represent. Most of the conservative chattering class was quietly hopeful of a Labour Party victory. They would be justified in opposing what they sneeringly refer to as populism. Boris Johnson is a boorish loudmouth, who has an uncanny appeal with working class people, despite being a man of privilege. He‚Äôs the sort of guy conservatives think should not exist. [‚Ä¶]

                I ran into the canard from a co-worker again last week, ‚ÄúI think this time more blacks will vote.. they are starting to realize that Trump is good for them!‚Äù
So they‚Äôll go from opposing Our interests by 95% to only stymieing us by 90%?
I‚Äôm sure their great awakening is just around the corner.  ‚ÄúFor reals this time‚Äù as my kids say.
Yay.

                    Penitent;OK, plenty of historical evidence that blacks don‚Äôt respond to appeals to ‚Äòinterest‚Äô from the GOPe.  Any chance that they might respond to ‚Äòfear‚Äô_?  As in, ‚ÄúHey bro, dose downtown honkey homo‚Äôs plannin‚Äô to replace *you*, not just me wid dem beaners.‚Äù

                        Al,There‚Äôs a lot to unpack in what you just said.Can you enlighten a generally hostile minority to the reality they will be replaced? To point, does that hatred for us exceed their dislike of foreign interlopers?Is this a people that have shown any collective wisdom, other than utilizing victimhood for advancement, historically?If fear can be used as a wedge, and they‚Äôve never shown a willingness en masse to snub the current arrangement, what real percentage will defect in protest vote and for how long? Aren‚Äôt we back to the wow this time only 75% worked against us?I suspect many would like to have a third option to get off the plantation and poke white and Jewish overseers in the eye while still not coming over to the Right. What third option is there?I see where you are going with this Al, I just don‚Äôt have any faith that they will rise, as ever, to the occasion. When the leading cause of your youth‚Äôs deaths are other youths from your own race‚Ä¶ I suspect your race might opt for suicide rather than wisdom, willingly or not.

                                Sheliak,Good point. Also in play might be the same delusion I think many white women (and some men) labor under.They simply cannot compute a world where white men are a powerless minority. They cannot fathom exactly how thin the veneer of civilization is, how thin the blue line, how the gibs are finite, how dangerous is the world. You saw this with Katrina and the Los Angeles riots. Nature and events stymied the powers that be‚Äôs abilities to respond. Folks were outraged because in the movies the US is all powerful, and the cavalry always arrives in time.So while I think many blacks would initially a power shift away from whites‚Ä¶ they have no idea what that reality actually looks like.

                            Penitent;To avert the rapidly materializing train wreck, open borders have *got* to be shut down ASAP.  This is only possible if the Commie whites are stopped.  Getting 25% + of the black vote in 2020 would stop the Commies, at least for now.It would be wonderful to have blacks become selfless Civ-Nats en mass.  But though there are some, particularly in the military, as you say, it seems unlikely.  It is also, maybe, unnecessary if other forces of strong motivation can be found to move *enough* of them off of the D plantation mindset that too many of them have become too comfortable with.Thucydides thought the the strongest motivations are honor, fear and interest/profit,* and I don‚Äôt think his formulation has been improved upon.So, since appeals to honor (e.g. failure of DR3 ‚Äì ‚ÄòDemocrats are the real racists‚Äô) have mostly failed and appeals to long term self-interest haven‚Äôt worked, that leaves fear.  And, no, I‚Äôm not talking bedsheets.  Even if this was possible, which it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs both morally wrong and it would bring on Civil War II for sure.  If we were to do that, the blame would (rightly) be on us, dooming any hope of prevailing.I *am* talking about neutralizing the the Prog-instilled fear of ‚Äòraaaciss whytes‚Äô.  Blacks *are* being displaced by Latinos everywhere, particularly in CA.  Their wages *are* being depressed by illegal immigrants, etc.  They can see this with their own eyes.  So, maybe they can be made to fear open borders in language they can readily understand.Could this, too, fail_?  Sure, but never let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough: Worth a try._________________________*https://infogalactic.com/info/Thucydides See the quotations section

                Yep. A lot of the conservative happy talk about a color-blind society isn‚Äôt for blacks or Hispanics, it‚Äôs for suburban white women. They don‚Äôt want to be a part of the ‚Äúmean‚Äù party and whites (but not others) discussing race is, well, icky in their minds.
White women are also the reason why the Dem leadership are trying to hold back full-on anti-white rhetoric. They still need the Nice White Lady vote. When the Dems don‚Äôt need the NWL vote, the anti-white floodgates will open.

                        There‚Äôs a lot of pent-up anger toward NWLs in the Coalition of the Fringes (COF). The COF correctly believes that NWLs are getting their cake and eating it too. NWLs get to claim victim status while being white, living in white neighborhoods and marry white guys (the evil behind everything).
That severely pisses off the COF, especially black women. NWLs are also pandered to by the media because they are the main consumers of TV shows, thus the myriad of NWL movies and series. For now, it‚Äôs a NWL world, but when that worms turns, watch out.

                            What sane white male of any means would want to take on the liability of a modern American wahmen? There is virtually no benefit to this unless you can find the needle in the haystack like the women that frequent this website, which by their own admission, they concede they are a statistical blip even in their own circles.Entitled, loud, not terribly intellectually curious, consumerist, usually not in the best physical shape, and largely ignorant of objective reality. That really sounds like a catch to me!One of the -only- (and I mean truly) only good things about living in District One is that I do get a nice cross section of foreigners to intermingle with. The difference between American women and Eastern Euro, Asian, or South Americans (as examples) is so stark now they are practically a different species.I haven‚Äôt dated an American in 8 years, and I don‚Äôt miss it even a little. They are invisible to me and even overhearing their vapid conversations grates on my nerves. Of course, you folks from flyover or more conservative areas may not have this view but if you are a coastal person it is virtually guaranteed. An entire generation and a half are basically lost and there WILL be major downstream effects we haven‚Äôt even begun to actualize or see yet.

NWL movies and shows never have good-looking Asian women. Naturally, the NWL always has a Black Best Friend (BBF), who is often good-looking. The shows‚Äô producers know how to please their audience and young, good-looking Asian women ain‚Äôt it. The NWLs know their competition and don‚Äôt need to see it in their shows.

                    I hope this happens sooner rather than later. NWLs are the -core- of this problem behind the (((handlers))). It has been known for a long time that women are social herd animals. They will do what they are told by authority usually w/o question. Critical thinking is not, was not, and never will be their strong suit, this is ok in normal situations. We are not in a normal situation, so they eagerly vote for their own long term disenfranchisement and will only come to know the truth when it literally hits them in the face.I‚Äôm hoping that comes in 2020 or 2024 at latest. Laws that start to openly discriminate against NWLs I‚Äôm 100% behind. I‚Äôd also like to see both verbal &amp; physical attacks on these people as well. One thing that will get wahmen running for any shelter they can find is feeling afraid. Right now, they have been decades without true fear. This is largely what got us into this clusterf‚Äìk to begin with. Fear is very important and without it you get the Mollie Tibbets, the ‚Äòbackpackers‚Äô from Scandi countries that go to Morocco or the Middle East for holiday, the green haired college libtard walking through the ghetto park at night, etc. etc.These minor incidents are happening but the frequency needs to happen much more often and of course the media will bury all of it like the muzzy rape gangs in UK but there comes a point where you cannot hide it all. This will be tipping point for many of them as they can no longer operate w/ impunity from danger from their own enabled pets.

Only issue is that, due to how I look (identical in appearance to an NWL), I could be mistaken for one.The key, therefore, is to ensure I am always near or with Basic Boyfriend (taking a page from Range‚Äôs descriptor of Basic Husband) for protection.

                        Well, let‚Äôs admit that a big reason NWLs are such a problem is because Nice White Men (NWM) didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt step up and say, ‚ÄúI will not accept this.‚Äù
As stupid and backward as they are, Muslim men do step up and refuse to accept GloboHomo. And you know what, their women back them up. I keep saying that we can learn a lot from Muslims in Europe. Total losers, yet they‚Äôre beating GloboHomo on its own turf.

                            Thing is my dude, the horse is rather out of the barn on this issue unfortunately. Yesterday‚Äôs topic addressed this with the divorce rape / DV fraud issue. It seemed like I was disagreeing with DBD but I wasn‚Äôt. He is 100% correct.You go ‚Äòfull Muslim‚Äô as a white male right now and you will land in a very dark dungeon in almost all circumstances for confronting a women in ANY way where she feels even a little threatened. Muslims can rape underage girls and walk, you see the glaring difference here?When I made my comment it was to say that every man has (or should have) a break point. I have reached mine. I have lost a LOT for a minor offense. So when I guy takes a stand he is not like some Muzz that has a get out of jail free card.Any woman (or minority) you confront has the potential to imprison you and destroy your career depending on how manipulative and wily they are about gaming the system. If it were a simple as just giving the gentle pimp backhand when needed we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation.The State has been fully weaponized. You are the new n1gger basically, it is just the all normies and even some of us dissident right haven‚Äôt swallowed this rather large black pill yet. I didn‚Äôt have a choice because I was living it in real time, but until you are hit w/ the full force of the State you may not believe it. I can promise you any man that has been crushed by a divorce court and may or may not get to see his kids has swallowed it too.Muzz also have a community behind them. Even WHEN they get charged there are 100 muzz out in front of the police station ready to burn it down. How many men in -your- orbit would lift a finger to defend you against false charges? For me it was zero. I‚Äôm guessing most people have similar numbers. So this is not as cut &amp; dried as ‚Äòfind your balls‚Äô we are past that point. What point we are at is ‚Äúhow much risk are you ready to assume and is death or imprisonment something you can tolerate‚Äù. Sad to say, but there it is.

                                APEX,You‚Äôre right, and I am sorry about happened to you. The state will come down on us like a ton of bricks if we push back in the smallest way. Perhaps my comment is ~20 years late.But we are where we are. Our version of pushing back at the moment is very passive. It‚Äôs saying to people at work or a party that you won‚Äôt stand for anti-white talk. They can say it but you‚Äôll leave. When dating, it‚Äôs telling the women that you believe that men and women are a partnership where each does what they do best ‚Äì men working and women staying home and being a mother.What I mean is that we‚Äôre in no position to fight back but we can let the world know that some of us don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs happening and aren‚Äôt going to live in that world.We find ourselves at a very low ebb, but we do what we can. As the government get more oppressive, others will start waking up. Will it be enough? Will it be soon enough? Who knows.But what alternative do we have? Where are you going to move that isn‚Äôt infected? Poland, Hungary. Maybe, but my family won‚Äôt move there, so I‚Äôll do my best here.

AP spot on. White men will abandon you for any thing that has a downside ( even if it just makes them feel uncomfortable) or provides an opportunity to virtue signal how alpha or woke they are. The ability to not come to the defense of other men is one of the key things that unify white men.
