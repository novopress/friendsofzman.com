        The Making White Women Cry segment reminds me just how much white men have failed white women. Look, white women catch a lot of very justified flack on the Dissident Right for failing white men, but we need to admit our own failing toward them.The white women going to these lectures are simply doing what women always do: Trying to figure out the rules of tribe and follow those rules. White women consider the general society to be their tribe so they use general society‚Äôs mores as their guide. Those instructions come from TV, movies, Netflix, Oprah, etc. If the tribe says to prostrate yourself to blacks, that‚Äôs what women will do. It‚Äôs in their DNA.Where white men have failed is in not openly rejecting that society and forming their own community. If the mass of white men simply rejected that society and banished women who adhered to its rules rather than the white community‚Äôs rules, white women would be forced to choose, and you can bet that they would choose the side of white men.White women have zero real desire to live around blacks, send their kids to black schools or to marry black men. Blacks know this, which is why, deep down, they hate white women. They know that white women are just larping.Women want leaders. Women want decisive men. Women want men who stand up for themselves and their tribe. White men are not doing that, so white women are sticking with the tribe that fights.

                Been there. I‚Äôve had more than a few ‚Äútwo minutes of hate‚Äù directed at me in social settings because I openly acknowledged racial differences or my preference for my own people. Guys who I know believed the same thing as me stood by silently. If even one or two of them backed me up, the whole dynamic would have changed. The preachy Nice White Ladies would have been facing a pack instead of a lone animal and that‚Äôs far more dangerous and they know it.

        Yay podcast! I just got back from the grocery store, I was there when they opened this morning, and the 60 something white manager was running around telling his black employees to have a ‚Äúsense of urgency.‚Äù What an exercise in futility

            Now THAT made me laugh.  That poor manager is using vocabulary his employees have never heard.  Corporate will ensure he gets an extra dose of sensitivity training next week; the manager sounds micro-aggressive.Reminds me of a story:  When my son was getting his first job he applied at the local FedEx ‚Ä¶ after the interview he told me he wouldn‚Äôt be getting the job because he was #24 on the list, and corporate hiring practices required that they hire applicants in order.  It happened sooner than I expected; exactly 6 days later my son got the call to come in to work.  FedEx had gone through 23 applicants ‚Äì some never showed up, some worked for 2 hrs and quit, some were high or hungover ‚Äì none had a ‚Äúsense of urgency.‚Äù  Most were what the mainstream press calls ‚Äúteens.‚Äù  Yeah, you know who they are.

I‚Äôve heard stories about Fedex, but wow, two hours. Was this for some distro facility? I gather the driving jobs aren‚Äôt so bad. Then, if you can get the licenses to drive the truck, you‚Äôve more than a few hours of stamina and discipline in you.

                    Whatever FedEx does to their drivers, I have no problem with their service.  Packages are alway delivered to the front door, which requires that the delivery person get out of the truck and open a gate and walk 20 feet or so.The USPS however with not do this, albeit they are hot to compete for a share of the ever increasing package delivery service. Instead, our postman drives up the driveway, tosses the box and the mail onto the driveway and drives off (mail is tossed with the package because it saves time putting mail into the standard mailbox at the street entry).After a particular heavy rain that destroyed the package and mail this summer, I had enough and filed a formal complaint with the inspector general (USPS website has no phone numbers for the local post office on their website, nor instruction for handling complaints locally).Sometime later, not too long, I get a late evening phone call which went to the recorder.  Poorly stated and hard to understand, but from what I gather it was the response from the local post office that they had no obligation to deliver mail to anything other than the mailbox and that if I was not happy with that, they would simply hold all packages and mail at the local post office for customer pickup. üôÇAnd that is the difference between private and public service in a nutshell.

                        I‚Äôve had good luck with Fedex.  A few weeks ago I was expecting several packages that had rental equipment for a Industrial Hygiene project that was scheduled to start early the following day.  I had to be away from the office for 15 minutes and it was my luck that the driver attempted to make the delivery while I was away.  I called the local office and asked them to contact the driver so she could redeliver the package or I would meet her in town.  The minutes later I got a call from the driver and she told me she was at the Hardee‚Äôs which was about a 1/2 mile away from me and she would be there for 15 minutes while she was resorting the packages in her truck.  I told her I would be there in a few minutes.  I drove over there and got the packages and every thing was right with the world.  My point about this little story is that there was a fast response time and the driver told me after I talked to her on the phone that she would have waited for me.

                        Yep, if there is a car parked close enough to our mailbox that the mailman would have to get out of his little truck, he just drives past and delivers it another day.

                    Yeah, I left out some details; for one, starting time was 0400.  These are the guys who sort packages and load the trucks.  To make the driver‚Äôs job more efficient they had to learn the routes and load the truck back-to-front.  Lots of lifting ‚Äì lots of ‚Äúsense of urgency.‚Äù  Between the early start time and the ire of pissed-off drivers for f@@@-ups, they churn through a lot of young folk in the hiring process.  Some things computers and bar codes can‚Äôt do, but the few menial jobs remaining will soon be roboticized.  Notice the proliferation of self-checkout?  About the only pleasant customer service I can find anymore is at Chick-Fil-A.  Gee, wonder why.

            I once was looking for a summer job while off from college‚Äîworking for me was the norm, college was the vacation.  I was often rejected for employment as they wanted year round people, rather than summer help, but I was desperate and even made application to car washes.Stopped into a large food manufacturing/processing plant and talked with the plant manager.  He said that they had an arrangement to hire summer help referred to them by the city, which meant inner city ‚Äúyouts‚Äù.  Three of the city‚Äôs finest were schedule to show up for the morning shift on Monday.  He told me to come around at beginning of shift, with my application and ask for the production manager, so and so.  Basically, he said or intimated that one or more of the city‚Äôs finest inner city affirmative action types would not show up.Monday came around and I was there on time and sure enough, of the three ‚Äúhires‚Äù, one showed up.  Since the production schedule at the plant was all-important, I was hired on the spot.  The other hire lasted a week or two and failed to show up for his shift one day and was never heard from again.BTW, every single manager/supervisor at the production floor level was Hispanic.  They were great guys to work under.  Of course, that was a long while ago, in another place and time‚Ä¶.sigh.

        Farming is hard.  Come from about 14 generations of farmers.  Still have a few.  Anybody who could got out of the business.  Where do you think the black population in Detroit came from?  Anybody in the south who could trade farming for one of Henry Fords 8 hour/$5 a day jobs came north starting with the labor shortages in WWI.  Organically farming baby vegetables sounds great until you‚Äôve shoveled your hundredth ton of organic manure fertilizer.

                I have only one word of advice ‚Äì quit taking our advice! Your show was just fine as you originally conceived of and executed it. Every time you take our advice on how to run it, it winds up being a step backwards that you always end up backing out of anyway. Use your own judgement! That‚Äôs what got you this far.

                It may not be the wisest decision to listen to radio people. ‚ÄúOur industry is gasping its last breath, so listen up noobie and learn, here‚Äôs how we do things.‚Äù
I suppose an argument can be made that radio is dying due to consolidation and enforced conformity and not because of the skills and knowledge of its engineers. But for what it‚Äôs worth, I never had a complaint about your format.

                    The intro is simply long to reduce the amount of content that needs to be produced.  It‚Äôs more padding.  Plus for a radio show where someone may be wandering off, it‚Äôs a signal that the show is starting.  I don‚Äôt see the need for a long one in a podcast.

            Long drawn out intros are a good opportunity make me just give up on the whole and go do something else.

            I think his descent into lunacy is tied more to his sexual orientation.  I lost a lot of interest in Drudge, not just because of the NeverTrumper crap, but because he makes sure the page is almost constantly advancing the Gay Agenda, or headlines about how gays are victims of this or that.  I flipped the switch for good when he started posting news about how transgenders are getting more social acceptance.  I was just like ‚Äúf**k off, man, those people are nut jobs‚Äù‚Ä¶social acceptance?  More like social intimidation, accept it or get destroyed.

        Funny you mention Drudge.  My family and I have been deleting the bookmark too, for the same reason.  We were just talking about this a few weeks ago.  I‚Äôm curious (because we‚Äôre all asking each other too), where to go for news.  I‚Äôve long since passed the point where I believe anything from the broadcast or cable nets.  The major ‚Äúpapers‚Äù are either tabloid trash or Democrat newsletters.  How best to stay informed?My old method, to read 8-10 different news sites, see what they are all parroting, and then assume the oppose is true, works pretty well.  But it‚Äôs like extended speaking in a foreign language ‚Äì always back-translating into English gets tiring.

            I‚Äôm old enough to remember when Drudge started up and was a little bit of a underground presence (only briefly).
I went about 10-12 years without visiting his site once, then went back during the 2016 election. Dude hasn‚Äôt changed anything there in 25 years. Does he still have Mike Royko or Charles Krauthammer listed as columnists?

        Zman, for what my opinion is worth, don‚Äôt bother with intro music; it‚Äôs a time waster. The best feature of your podcast is that you get directly to the business of delivering your stuff and quit when you‚Äôre finished. For a wretched example of what not to do, try listening  to Scott Adams.  Skip the music at the end, too. Listen to recordings of the real pros, from the time when radio was a serious medium. The best signoff was Paul Harvey, who‚Äôd simply say, ‚ÄúPaul Harvey‚Ä¶.good day‚Äù, then he‚Äôd shut up.You‚Äôve got the best produced podcast out there, don‚Äôt mess it up with gimmicks.

                I grew up on a farm, and we were regular listeners. You‚Äôre right, he could tell a story. For contrast, listen to narrations by the up talking beta voices on NPR with the incessant bleepily toodily music in the background. You can gauge the decline of American manhood from the changes in radio voices.

        I liked your point that ‚Äúwhite nationalists‚Äù are just people want to live the same life as academics and the rich on a working man‚Äôs salary. It‚Äôs a succinct way of putting what is really a simple idea but has to be expressed in convoluted ways so one doesn‚Äôt get sent to the gulags, e.g. ‚Äúmoving to a good school district with a stable real estate market.‚Äù I guess it‚Äôs not pithy enough to post a bunch of flyers on telephone poles, but I know I‚Äôm going to make use of it.I see that somebody already pointed out that Dartmouth is not in Vermont, but in your defense, New Hampshire and Vermont are actually the same state. Pretending they are different states is a conspiracy by elementary social studies teachers.

        The whole racism was invented by colonialism thing drives me batty. One of the things these loons point to is the lack of racial designation in writings from ancient world  but the reason for that is because people generally stayed in their areas and looked like they came from these areas so if you talked about a thracian you would know that person probably have light eyes and red hair and white skin. I have never believed that they weren‚Äôt as in group oriented as we are today. Or should be in a sane  world. It‚Äôs all sophistry

            People in the ancient world made plenty of catty criticisms about groups, but they tended to center their views and remarks around city-states and nations as ethnes or peoples, not ‚Äúrace‚Äù.  Thus, Celts/Gauls were dumb and easily angered, Numidians (North Africans) were overly fixated on sex, Lydians (southwest Anatolia) were slimeballs, Egyptians were ancient and mysterious, Boeoitians were rubes, etc.  Curiously, there was near-unanimous agreement that Jews were hate-filled, spiteful, vengeful, and possibly  bat-sh!t crazy.

            Comedy can be reality.  One source of endless mirth was watching the fight over the Cape Wind project play out for nearly 15 years.  For the unaware this was a proposed offshore wind farm in Nantucket Sound.  And originally would have replaced a power plant on the Cape that ran on #6 fuel oil.  Win/win.  Right?  Oh no, the windmills would have been in eyesight of the Kennedys and all the rich liberals on the Cape and Nantucket.  And as silly as most wind power is, it is one place where the wind always blows.  So they fought it more viciously than the VC in Hue.  Problem was there was no waterfront property with just poor people to stick it by.  Took the local Nantucket paper at home year round‚Äîthe editorial letters opposing were simply priceless.  That asswipe Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is the reason we‚Äôre running out natural gas supply in NY, was the ringleader.  Can‚Äôt make it up.

                If New York is running out of natural gas supply, it‚Äôs because pipelines aren‚Äôt being built and/or government is preventing its use, or something along those lines.  There is an abundance of natural gas available in the U.S. and prices are low.

                    Oh, it is absolutely a pipeline problem‚Ä¶.see natural gas is evil, so he‚Äôd rather see people freeze in the dark than let the Dark Forces build a pipeline.  One of my kids interns with an LNG firm‚Äîbecause of the supply problem coming across NY, looks like MA has to add another offshore terminal to pipe in re-gasified LNG in the winter.  Double irony, the existing one frequently offloads Russian gas when spot loads are available at attractive prices.  Who knew the good Leftists of the Peoples Republic of MA were colluding with Putin.

        Regarding the Public Enemy intro, I don‚Äôt understand how whites can listen to rap without feeling sick.  It‚Äôs music made to excite the people that hate you.
(I concede that there is silly rap, like Young MC‚Äôs ‚ÄúBust a Move‚Äù or Run DMC‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou Be Ill‚Äôin‚Äù but those are the exceptions.)
To  argue against myself, I confess that I like a lot of rock which was an attack on traditional, wholesome USA.

        Another little shit weasel in my Utah world is Mitt Romney (Mike Lee is not far behind).  This reincarnation of John McCain is complete with a major ego disorder that non-stop prompts him to be the first to leap on a piano bench, clutch his pearls and scream hysterically at the Bad Orange mouse.Whatever the Left and Never Trumpers shriek about is a projection of what they are doing and hiding. Romney was yelling from his piano bench a little too quick and drew some fire.So the latest about Romney is absolutely delicious! His 2012 national security adviser for his campaign was Joseph Cofer Black, a career CIA Spook.https://www.zerohedge.com/political/after-trash-talking-trump-ukraine-call-former-romney-adviser-exposed-burisma-board-memberFast forward to February 2017, when Black joined the¬†board of directors of BURISMA,¬†6 months after the departure¬†of Hunter Biden.Not a word in Mormonland media exposing this. Would love to see more dirt on Globalist Pirate Romney gains.Basic Husband reminded me that one of the songs I sang in the Messiah Christmas presentation was:All We Like Sheep!

            Romney‚Äôs little buddy Brian Hook sits at the right side of Pompeo. Master‚Äôs degree in philosophy from Boston College, and someone who styles himself a Straussian of sorts.No loyalty to anyone but himself and his 120 pounds of foppishness. If people on this site only knew how many of these Incompetents are in charge of serious matters, they‚Äôd really start stocking up. Trump has too many of these people around him. He can‚Äôt keep them straight in his head because he doesn‚Äôt understand the background or the allegiances that these people have.The real blackpill is seeing just how many have encircled Trump with the eventual aim of doing him in. They have no loyalty to anyone but themselves, their wars, and their money. You just can‚Äôt trust anyone in DC. It‚Äôs impossible. You can‚Äôt drain it.

            Corn,
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first to make this observation but I heard excerpts from Thunberg‚Äôs -whatever the hell that was- and all I could hear was Paul Muad‚Äôdib‚Äôs creepy little sister from Dilaurentis‚Äô Dune.
Then I remembered Red Ice Radio mentioning her. Apparently she has been a thing in Europe.  Vox Day calls her ‚Äúthe Gretard.‚Äù
Everything about the kid sets every one of my American cells on creepout mode. I hope her handlers eventually get gulaged for using that little misfortunate like that.

                The Booby says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hate so much on the creepy little Gretas of the world‚Äù but instead on the two generations of spoiled brats and douchebags who gave birth the Millennials and Gen Z.
Gen-X, in particular, deserves our deepest scorn, and being an older Xer the Booby is well positioned to do just that:
https://theredfootedbooby.com/2019/09/23/generation-douchebag-how-gen-x-became-the-baby-boomers-bottom-bitch/

The Booby gave due credit to the exceptions in the above link, but noted that since the media and pop culture only care about the wealthy and/or ‚Äúeducated‚Äù Boomers and Xers then we‚Äôll just go along with that.
You are now free to hate on creepy little Greta.

                    Well, I don‚Äôt complain about Millennials or Xers or any other generation. I am not an age bigot like Vox Day.I see the f‚Äôing leftists who were always the problem. I see god damn Yankees. I see damn ‚Äúfeminists‚Äù. We have many problems but they are not just one generation or the other.I know that the adults just after WW2 had it made. At least in the big industrial cities. By the time I graduated high school in the 70s we knew inflation, ‚Äústag-flation‚Äù, gas going up 4 fold in a week or two. Good times!I also know that the horrible legislation of the 50s and 60s was not driven by boomers ‚Äî we could not vote. Do the math people.

        Am continuing from yesterday‚Äôs blog.  Z‚Ä¶.the muses inspired your Too Corrupt to Fail blog! Went down in history.  Basic Husband is still squishing around. He still can‚Äôt take me saying anything contrary to Trump or Bar‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but he listened to me read your yesterday blog.  He thinks he‚Äôs a realist but too much reality fires up his nervous system.  Then I calm him down like petting the cats.
Lineman and MossHammer‚Ä¶..thank you for your efforts to clarify.  You have both given me strong information to use.
Lineman‚Ä¶..will take you up on that campfire talk.Stay strong, Gentlemen!

            My guess is that your husband thinks the way I sometimes do ‚Äì contrasting today‚Äôs Trump/Barr with yesterday‚Äôs Obama/Holder, or what might-have-been Hillary.  Those comparisons nearly make Trump &amp; Barr look angelic.  But it‚Äôs like comparing a Twinkie to a S%%t-filled Twinkie ‚Äì one is more enjoyable than the other but it still ain‚Äôt steak.

                    Yes ma‚Äôam ‚Äì completely agree.  A common military phrase is ‚Äúhope is not a strategy.‚Äù  If we could imagine a series of doable, realistic tactical corrections that could turn this thing around then we wouldn‚Äôt be talking about Too Corrupt to Fail.  That leaves the only viable option ‚Äì reality.A common perception of the ‚Äúhopers‚Äù is that we‚Äôre all  pessimists.  Wrong.  I turn it around on the ‚Äúhopers‚Äù ‚Äì they‚Äôre cherry-picking their data in order to live in a virtual happy-land.  There‚Äôs a word for ‚Äúhopers‚Äù when reality crashes their party ‚Äì VICTIM.  And this is why I keep trying to sway my family‚Äôs hearts/minds ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to see the people I love being enslaved by a corrupt system.

        (26:24 ‚Äì 26:30)  ‚ÄúIf racial equality is to be an achievable goal‚Äù. Setting the 100% adoption as the ‚Äòend goal‚Äô is a favorite progressive tactic. 100% voter participation is another one with endless handwringing about ‚Äúour democracy‚Äù.

        What in god‚Äôs good name is ‚ÄúAfrican Farming?‚Äù  Africans weren‚Äôt farmers. There was very little farming in Africa and there certainly wasn‚Äôt the type of large scale farming seen during the slavery era in Africa unless it was the white people.  To the extent there is any history of farming in African-American communities, it is only to the extent that we are talking about their ancestors in America.I always found Obama‚Äôs ‚ÄúDreams of My Father‚Äù to be rather ironically titled.  Obama had very little contact with his father for his entire life.  But the one thing his father gave him is the one thing that got him elected and protected him from media scrutiny during his time in office. That, of course, is his black skin.  If Obama had been white, nobody would know who he is and he wouldn‚Äôt have even been elected as a Senator, let alone President.Obama was raised by white people. The only people who ever cared about him were white as is true with most mulattos. Yet, he became a rather extreme racialist. A very large percentage of black racialists are also mulattos.

            Dartmouth is the most conservative of the Ivies, which isn‚Äôt saying a lot these days, but it had a pretty conservative student body in the 80‚Äôs.  Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza and Laura Ingraham were there at that time, part of the Dartmouth Review and the pipeline into the Reagan administration.  Still a special place.

        The reason we listen to the Z Blog Power Hour and NOT to professional radio‚Ä¶ is because really don‚Äôt LIKE professional radio.

        The ‚Äúraptivist‚Äù is cradling an armful of purple kohlrabi.  It would be difficult to embrace a more European vegetable.  Ironies abound.Rather disappointed in the Ken Burn‚Äôs Country Music saga.  It was the Johnny Cash Story, with a few other folks thrown in (poor Porter Wagoner only popped in to play the villain), and oh yeah, did you realize how important blacks were to the Louvin Brothers?  Cash always distanced himself from his Arkansas roots and never wanted to be thought of as a hick, hence his acceptance by and popularity with good Boomers. The disappointment is, of course, entirely of my own devising:  PBS is gonna PBS, and why would I think different?

        Looking forward to listening on my way home today.Re: New HampshireI have not watched the new Ken Burns deal on country music. I assume, as someone else, can‚Äôt remember who, once observed, there‚Äôs  always a part in his documentaries where he plays the ‚Äúwhoa, pity the poor Negroes‚Äù card.  Interestingly his sympathy for the Black man does not include living among them. He lives in Walpole NH, in perhaps the whitest county in the US.Full disclosure: I know him a little bit, and he‚Äôs always been nice to me. I forgive him for leaving Harmon Killebrew out of his baseball documentary, and for the Moe Howard haircut.

                    The Beatles‚Äô used to send a free 45 of mostly-nonsense Christmas chatter and songs to their fan club each year. One features Lennon in a speed-rap that ends with ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an all-white policy in this group.‚Äù
Then there is an album of Let It Be outtakes with a song called No More Pakistanis. This would have been the year after Powell‚Äôs Rivers of Blood speech.

            Years ago when NRO first allowed comments, one of their in-house sissies wrote about Burns, extolling him a great champion of the black man. It may have been about his baseball documentary. I posted a comment on the post, pointing out that Burns moved from New York to a place with zero black people. At the time, his town had something like seven non-whites. The comment was eventually deleted.A great rule of thumb is to google where someone lives and then do an image search of the local high school basketball team. If the team is all white, the town is a Progressive bastion.

                Z and Lineman in Montana‚Ä¶..the latest on Ken Burns.  When we have the revolution, think about what Ken Burns has wrought on us.The article from Range Magazine is stunning and good journalism from Dave Skinner. The American Prairie Reserve is a Lefty front to take large swaths of land and re-wild it, removing people and ranches and turning it into The Kings Park. People are bad, wolves and buffalo are good!http://www.rangemagazine.com/features/fall-19/fa19-range-sr-critical_mass.pdfPlease People‚Ä¶.wake up to the Globalist travesties in the West. You never hear of these back east.Ken Burns is a little Lefty shit Weasel‚Ä¶.‚ÄúWhy would Burns attach his fame to APR? From an interview with AtlanticMagazine star writer James Fallows: ‚ÄúI fell in love with the area (Montana). But I was also conscious of how difficult it was [when filming] to achieve the pristine perspective of Lewis and Clark. There was a fence line of an old homestead here, a crumbling shack there, the cattle which were tagged and lowing contentedly in the field.  There were highways and hydro dams and even the black cars of the servicemen who serviced the nuclear missile sites. So we were straining to find a sense of what Lewis and Clark saw.‚Äù Really, dude!‚Äù‚ÄúWell, buried in the guck of APR‚Äôs Form 990 is the truth: Ranked number two in the list of APR‚Äôs top five independent 2017 contractors (Niebur Excavating of Lewistown was tops at $1.3million) is Ken Burns, 45 Main Street, Suite 1030, Brooklyn, NY: $650,198. Yeah, a tremendous honor, indeed.‚ÄùFollow the money!  Lineman‚Ä¶.Ken Burns wants your land!

Walton looks like my grandaughter tranny before she went tranny to guy ala Chas Bono.  Socially whacked.
Walton looks like she was socially maladjusted when young and this is now the result. Pissed at white people. You‚Äôre looking at mental illness.
Guys‚Ä¶don‚Äôt bother looking.  She‚Äôd bite your ears off, your head off, your whoop-whoop off, throw white paint on you and lock you in the stocks. Don‚Äôt linger here.

        Re: Making White Girls Cry; I don‚Äôt know which is more tedious, the ‚Äúthinking‚Äù behind the ‚Äúargument‚Äù or the vulgarity that‚Äôs probably essential to hide the poor logic.Re: Greta Thunberg; awful of me, but when I see her pic I think ‚Äúthrow a little pig‚Äôs blood and you have Sissy Spacek as Carrie‚Äù.Re: Baltimore‚Äôs lead problem; this troubled me since it was brought up again post Freddy Gray, as an argument about the impact of lead leading to criminal behavior. As Mr. Zman said, lead is not a new problem, it‚Äôs been known for decades. Why is this still a big problem in Baltimore? Most people, however they regard race, don‚Äôt like to think of babies and small kids being dosed with lead. Since it‚Äôs used so often as a racial thing, I can only conclude that the lead problem isn‚Äôt fixed because people don‚Äôt really want it fixed. It‚Äôs too useful to be used for proxy racist arguments. It‚Äôs sad.

        Dartmouth in in Hanover, New Hamster (What us Vermonters used to call New Hampshire).The frats at Dartmouth served as the inspiration for ‚ÄúAnimal House‚ÄùI used to go to the Shrine Maple Sugar Football game between the Vermont and New Hamster all stars and had a good time watching the drunk masons driving their little go carts in a parade and eating one-half of of a BBQ chicken.The game benefited the cripples ‚ÄúStrong legs run so that weak legs may walk.‚ÄùThe most disappointing game was when the idiot coach of Vermont (Rutland Vt High School Coach) used Ollie Dunlap (black running back speedster) as a decoy.Dunlap went on to become a successful Defensive back in the Canadian Football League

        Z, you‚Äôd make a good choice following Limbaugh‚Äôs lead in how to do radio. He‚Äôs still the biggest show on radio.
I‚Äôd also cut him a break on his sound. Since he lost his hearing, he‚Äôs had some substantial realtime technical challenges in hearing and understanding callers and communicating with staff during the show.
Amazing the show ‚Äì and he ‚Äì sounds as good as it does if you ask me.

            Rush does more harm that good because he convinces people that multiracial USA can work if we just embrace race-blind conservatism, which is biologically impossible for most non-whites.  (I understand that he has a personal motivation to avoid punishment, but that doesn‚Äôt change the truth of my statement.)

                I used to be in that camp, because the military services seem to make the multiracial thing work pretty well.  But then I realized that we only make it work well when the minorities are a DISTINCT and SMALL minority.  When they reach a certain proportion ‚Äì a proportion that allows them to establish organized cliques ‚Äì then the game is up.
And this is more theory than observation:  The multicultural thing may be absorbed as a body blow when a culture of morals/ethics is dominant; the multicultural thing is a knockout blow to a culture confused on moral/ethical questions.

                BTW, Charles Murray and another professor were roughed up at Middlebury.  Via John Derbyshire.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-As in Mao Tse-tung‚Äôs Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, persons demoted or blacklisted years before and left to vegetate in silent ignominy were dragged out from their places of banishment to be ‚Äústruggled‚Äù anew for the edification of the masses. Murray encountered this new atmosphere of zealotry when, six weeks into the Trump Presidency, he showed up at Middlebury College, a small liberal-arts school in Vermont, to give a talk about his book Coming Apart at the invitation of a conservative club at the college. More than a hundred shouting, chanting protestors prevented him from speaking. He was eventually able to give his talk, in the form of an interview with Middlebury professor Allison Stanger, by video from a closed room, while the protestors set off fire alarms in the corridors outside. However, when Murray and Prof. Stanger were escorted out from the back of the building by college officials:[S]everal masked protesters, who were believed to be outside agitators, began pushing and shoving Mr. Murray and Ms. Stanger, Mr. Burger [a spokesman for the college] said. ‚ÄúSomeone grabbed Allison‚Äôs hair and twisted her neck,‚Äù he said.After the two got into a car, Mr. Burger said, protesters pounded on it, rocked it back and forth, and jumped onto the hood. Ms. Stanger later went to a hospital, where she was put in a neck brace.

                    I especially enjoyed this Power Hour, being very familiar with both Hanover, NH and Brattleboro, VT. I could tell stories‚ÄìOK, you twisted my arm.Might have been twenty years ago in Brattleboro, some Indian (feather, IIRC) was  outraged that the HS mascot, a stereotypical colonel, was somehow ‚Äúracist.‚Äù It took the spineless administration about three microseconds to take down his image. People used to wear t-shirts with his image in protest. The town may be most famous for its no ‚Äúno nudity‚Äù statute. Perverts loved to take advantage of that to flash people, or just walk nude down the street. Breast fest was popular for awhile, when feminists would parade topless to protest something. Kooky place, but huwyte.
