        “America First” as a phrase is of course inevitably associated with, as usual, the ghosts of the 1940s and the ongoing obsession with Mustache Guy and used as a club to beat the political right into submission with that used to be much more effective.To the Bagels, America First is antisemitic, because the moral duty of America is to sacrifice everything for Bagels, because America didn’t want to in 1933 all the way to 1941.To the foreigners, America First is racist.To the Spiteful Mutants, America First is Christian.To the Fistagon and the MIC,America First is their doom.However, as we have seen happening more rapidly as of late, flogging the dead horses of the mid 20th century does have an expiry date.

            The ghosts of the 1940s included Charles Lindburgh, Robert Taft, and John F. Kennedy.  From the perspective of 2024, the concerns of the America First movement appear remarkably prescient.  FDR repeatedly violated the Neutrality Act by shipping arms to belligerant powers and provoked the Japanese government with a series of economic and financial sanctions (sound famiiar?).  Although Charles Lindburgh was denounced for noticing how Jews sought to involve the US in the war, during the war the fate of Jews was hardly an issue of concern–Dwight Eisenhower, Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle never mentioned it during the war, nor did they discuss it in their memoirs.  And, as Ron Unz has noticed, any journalist or commentator who had been critical of the Roosevelt Administration’s foreign policies between 1939 and 1942 was ruthlessly deplatformed.  America had probably become an empire before the intervention into World War II, but that intervention definitely settled the question of republic versus empire in favor of the latter.  Anyone claiming the title of America First in 2024 is heir to a good tradition, “Mustache Man” to the contrary norwithstanding.

                        One full cycle according to Strauss and Howe is 84 years. These theories have their limitations, but there are legit reasons why they exist.

                            I think Strauss and Howe are pretty spot on with the length of the cycle.
My issue with them is that they really seem to process the facts through their own peculiar worldview to arrive at their detailed conclusions.

                                I don’t see a predictive framework as an issue, but as useful and succinct. (Nice catch, Blasphemous.)
Gotta keep it simple, man, that’s why a Biblical God as an overall concept can be an extremely ‘useful’ shorthand.

                                …which is precisely what Nietzsche called “the prejudices of philosophers” (first section ofBeyond Good and Evil.). A philosopher’s inner beliefs, perhaps even subconscious, influence his theories or other “truths” he may claim to have found. I see no reason why this tendency would not extend to all fields of human intellectual activity. One easy example of that is cherry picking; we’re prone to choose evidence that supports our argument and ignore what doesn’t. The scientific method and other tools can defend against these defects but they aren’t always used, including by professionals who should know better but it turns out they have the same human frailties as we lowly mortals.

                            I assume you respond to my post rhetorically – as I simply posted what HIS platform was in 1916.
There is also a subtext, perhaps too subtle — that those claiming to be ‘American First’, say in the case of Wilson, FDR, in terms of keeping us out of foreign wars, were not what they said they were.
In any case, ‘how could’ is not for me to answer as it is a non sequitur response to my point or simply droll.

                                Lincoln, Wilson, FDR and TR are the worst Presidents we’ve had. They all started the ball rolling downhill that led to where we are today. Without them we would have never had the crooks, idiots and tards we’ve been stuck with over the last 40-50 years. Bide, Obama and both Bushes are the fake and gay successors to them.

                        What is it after seeing Trump as president for four years and this “will the real Donald J. Trump please stand up” all over this board. Just waiting for him to morph into chairman Mao or LBJ. What you see is what you get from Trump. He may not have delivered the goods as promised his first term. It was not for lack of effort. When has Trump pulled a policy bait and switch?

                I have been finding it very interesting that with the new AI “interpretations” of mustache man have been reforming his image quite a bit. It’s easy to say he was crazy when you don’t understand the words and all you can see is a raving lunatic onstage.
Now that we can hear his speeches like the audience would have heard them, and also see how the audience responds to his arguments, they don’t seem so crazy. Instead, they seem prophetic.

                during the war the fate of Jews was hardly an issue of concern–Dwight Eisenhower, Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle never mentioned it during the war, nor did they discuss it in their memoirs.
There is a reason why they were not concerned with their fate, but it’s illegal to say in my local jurisdiction.

                Only John F Kennedy matters in terms of ghosts. Society works within living memory. Charles Lindburgh was the guy who piloted a plane to Paris without first class and seatbelt. What he was known for during the 1920’s-1950’s otherwise is lost to our Boomerriffic society.Because we living in a Boomerific society Mustache Man is the founding of the modern world, and history goes no farther.

            The best part of this slogan is dusting off the slogan of an old boogeyman (the WWII isolationists) and making it your own. The old mythologies are losing steam and the elite class is desperately trying, and failing, to create new, grand myths. That was the entire point of the Floyd nonsense, the gay marriage push, etc.The problem is their leaders are becoming more decrepit, their folk heroes are outright criminals, and social media is making it impossible to sweep their more unsavory elements under the rug. If the 1960’s revolutions were today, every normal person would see the bombings, the murders, and the riots. Instead of seeing dumb hippies putting flowers in a soldier’s muzzle or MLK giving a speech, they would see the Blackstone Rangers terrorizing ethnic neighborhoods and looting riots that would look suspiciously similar to the Summer of Floyd.

                Exactly. The Summer of Floyd was simply a recurrence of the Long Hot Summers of 1965, 1966 and 1967. And so long as we keep playing paddy-cake with the nuggras, we’ll get plenty more of that kind of action.

            The great thing about the phrase “America First” is that it has the same quality that “Black Lives Matter” unfortunately shares: to push back against it makes someone look really, really bad. “You aren’t for America first?” “You mean black lives do not matter?” The rhetoric survived the Nazi fearmongering for a reason–to be offended by it is to lose.

                The Pajheets are perfectly comfortable working with the Finkels. That said, the first have a better sense of tribe and physically look different than Europeans. The Finkels can only co-opt the civilization of Christianity, being familiar with it in rejection of it. The Pajheets come from a pagan society unfamiliar with it other than in the form of British colonization. India is a basket case. It’s not going to take long for Pajheet to be an obvious bad idea where the Finkels can blend in indefinitely.

            All the arguments over “America First!” would evaporate if the slogan were to be replaced by “AMERICANS First!”
“America First!” embraces empire, while “AMERICANS First!” puts the emphasis smack dab where it belongs, on us, “the people.” “AMERICANS First!” embodies the principle of government serving the people, while “America First!” embodies an imperial imperative.
“AMERICANS First!” demolishes missionary wars, imperial sanctions on foreign powers, “free trade,” “refugee” resettlement, legal and illegal imminvasion, and all the other ills that the Imperial Ruling Elite have imposed upon us, the people.

                Very well thought out and said! Indeed, it isAmericanswhose interests should be uppermost in the mind of anyone who aspires to office as well as in the minds and actions of all those who occupy its soil, particularly those who have no legal or moral right to be in the country and those who are public employees, all those whose incomes depend on taxpayer largesse.Americans First! The collective abstraction “America” is ever-more abstract as the nation fragments into identity politics, regional differences more pronounced  than at any time since the mid-nineteenth century, plus a financial system directed by a cabal that is anti-American by its very existence. Want to put Americans first? Begin by making sweeping political changes and dismantling the anti-Constitutional financial system imposed in 1913, the former required by the latter if serious civil disturbance can still be avoided, far from certain given the government and its adjuncts now imposed upon a long-suffering citizenry. .

            One area where I strongly disagree with Z-man is his theory that the Regime is indifferent to Whites…Not at all true..DEI is explicitly anti-white, and many of their supporters (mostly deranged females) absolutely hate whites..They have been destroying white jobs and opportunities for decades, at least 50 years, and promoting every 80+ IQ foreigner or mutant into their jobs…This has been quite visible to some of us since the early 1970s….

                Just out of high school I applied for a job with a government agency. It was part time and involved collecting data from remote seismic recording stations that did not have telemetry. They were serviced every two weeks, needing batteries, a change of the paper on the data-recording cylinders, etc. The candidate needed some understanding of various technologies.Two white guys interviewed me. My answers had them looking at each other in consternation. I thought what in the world – these are easy questions.Then one of them said “I’m really sorry, we’ve been told we have to hire a minority.”This was June 1972.

                    Yet another example of nothing new under the sun. The anti-white crusade has been with us for over half a century. Quite sad that many whites are only how hoisting in the unsettling truth while others continue to resist it.

                        I don’t think people were in denial that it was happening; the term Affirmative Action has been with us for a long time. While AINO was 90% white they felt there was an upper limit to how much AA could be done so they were more willing to tolerate it. Now that the percentage of whites is dropping toward 50 they realize there is no limit.

                            But AA is more than a horrendously misbegotten government initiative; it is an entire culture. Hence, mere scrutiny, let along criticism of negroes is forbidden on pain of personal bankruptcy, while the most nugatory of negro “achievements” are vaunted as if they landed on the moon, composed the fifth symphony, or built Durham Cathedral. In any sane nation, i.e. one bereft of AA, nobody outside of Bed-Stuy or Compton would have even heard of rap, yet it’s AINO’s national soundtrack.The flipside of this moronic negrolotry is an uncategorical condemnation of the Blue-Eyed Ice Devil as the source of all the world’s problems and the creator of none of its solutions.Whites should have glommed onto the malicious intellectual and psychic underpinnings of AA long, long ago, yet they did not, and fearful, perhaps irreversible damage has been done as a result.

                            There’s also the way the remaining Whites are encouraged to adopt perversions and affectations as a backdoor into the AA/DIE benefits. White women, in particular, are encouraged to adopt a trashy, slutty image and denounce men. The overall rule is that if a White person, male or female, wants to get a slice of the AA pie, he must debase himself, adopt an offensive and ugly personal style, and generally act like a fool or an uncouth savage. This is how you become an “honorary negro” and become acceptable to the corporate culture.

            “However, as we have seen happening more rapidly as of late, flogging the dead horses of the mid 20th century does have an expiry date.”In reality, it should no longer have any effect whatsoever.  But it still does. We’ve been brainwashed.  I was born 25 years after ww2 ended and I still have all this programming.  We all had this programming. It came from everywhere. From the TV, from the schools, from the press and radio along with books and magazines and from the culture.  “Racism” being defined as the worst evil imaginable.  After all, went our programming, it was extremely “unfair” to treat the outsider or “other” any different than we would treat our own brothers.  This, of course, is evil.  But evil was taught as good. It still is.I don’t believe the youth are on our side in large numbers.  To begin with, the White youth are a minority. White kids are less than 50%.  How many think they are trannies now? Or homos?  How many are already on Ritalin, particularly our young boys?   How many will be lost to either drugs or drug crime?  How many of those not left wing, who largely agree with us will get into elite universities and graduate without being absorbed by the borg and eventually enter the elite where they can actually make changes?

        I think you’re right that the system dodged a figurative bullet when that literal one merely grazed Trump. Another few centimeters the other way and they would have gotten what they wished for, only with terribly ironic consequences, like something from “The Monkey’s Paw.”Walter Kirn—an old-style democrat from Montana and not given to hyperbole or conspiracy—says an old regime friend told him the plan was probably for Trump to be dead before the RNC. The seeding of the media with stories about an Iranian hand in assassination attempts would have helped Haley astroglide her way into the nomination, the way the more cynical among us predicted happening anyway. It could have very well been a neocon scheme.There’s an old saying: if you try to kill the king, you’d better kill the king. They can always try to get Trump again, but the images start to take on a life of their own after a while. Even people who aren’t superstitious will start to look at a man differently if he keeps “getting lucky” like that. Literal religious movements are born out of that kind of ferment. Little kids in realms as far-flung as Africa and China are reenacting Trump’s “Fight” chant after he got hit with the bullet.The craziest part of it all was that if the regime just made a deal with Trump—as you suggested—right now he’d be leaving office, sated, if not outright exhausted with his two terms. But by trying to keep the lid on nonelite frustration rather than doing a bit of outgassing, they’re turning a teakettle into a volcano. It makes me wonder if they don’t subconsciously want to bring about their own destruction through the fascist revolution they’ve heretofore-merely hallucinated.More likely things will just keep getting slightly worse and worse, especially with the Border, while the MIC and Israel continue to do what they want. I will say that Trump is the first person I ever saw say something like “No” to Bibi’s face in a press conference. All he said was “I’d like to see you slow down on the settlements,” but he said it in public. Netanyahu of course looked at him like he was Oliver Twist asking for more gruel. I haven’t seen Ivanka’s sewer-dwelling prince consort from the Chabad cult lately, so maybe people are right, and Trump has learned. Then again, maybe Jared is busy building condos on the corpses over there right now.

            The prosecutions have merged in the public mind with the State-sponsored assassination attempt. That’s not a good long-term prospect for the Regime. Stalin learned this the hard way but he was crazier than he was stupid. Our versions have that in reverse order.
But, yes, slow, steady decline is possible. Don’t discount a sudden collapse, either, if the lunatics decide the window is closing to conduct another world war. It is a miracle we have avoided a nuclear war so far, and that is only due to the Russians being less emotionally incontinent than the domestic psychopaths.

                    To me it’s pretty obvious. As bad as our system May be, it isn’t this bad. As Sundance has said, it appears to me that they’ve got Judas a goats throughout the system pushing the right buttons, exaggerating what has gone on in the past so that it hits us upside the head, so we see it, so we get to a slow boil so that Trump can do something about it.Election night was a great example. That just doesn’t happen in real life. Likewise with the 59 times the courts told people to pound sand after they complained.In what reality do we elect a drooling nursing home patient got elected to be president for two terms?This is like a Seinfeld bizarro episode penned by the twisted mind of Larry David. I’m surprised more people don’t see it.

                                The most hilarious thing was when Trump was asked by some MSM talking head about it and she was saying these people think that these high profile people were abusing children/’adrenochrome’ etc., (note that this was during the height of Epstein exposure), and Trump was like yeah, well, what would be so bad about people that would want to stop that type of abuse? Whoops. lol

                            You know, in 2016, I thought God was pushing it along. I thought there were so many obstacles put in Trump’s way that no mere mortal could surmount all of those challenges unless God was helping out.But I scratched my head as to why. Why would God care what happens in a single election when he’s got a billion planets to tend to? I thought it might be the abuse of children that got him involved for a while.But, nah. Everything is too scripted. It’s all part of the same psyop. It’s a psyop from the good guys, but it’s still a psyop.

                                Well, there’s the scripture about when abuses are so bad they reach to heaven. That covers that. It’s probably hard for Americans to really understand how bad things may be around the world especially for innocents. We’re slowly finding out though.

                        TempoNick, looks like you’re a fan of X22 Report featuring “Dave.”  Dave’s been pitching the same message for a long time, which is essentially the Qanon “trust the plan,” which includes the regime being arrested any time now.When nothing happens, Dave kicks the can down the road a bit more, with his declarations that “the people have to see it.”  It’s a lot of hopium and copium, and he says absolutely nothing about the war on White people or the tribe holding vast disproportionate power, which speaks volumes about Dave’s credibility.Dave’s a true gatekeeper with thousands of patriotic believers.

                            Yes, but why would Eric Trump appear on that show twice? If there was nothing to queue, it would be toxic to Eric Trump. He wouldn’t get within a thousand miles of that show.
Dave also has a lot of gaps in his knowledge and his pronunciations of things, but that’s okay. The podcast is entertaining enough.

                            The two questions I ask myself is, first, who made Google change their name to Alphabet, as in “alphabet agencies?” (Seed money for Google was provided by DARPA or so they say, and we all know intel uses them to spy on us.) Big corporations have no sense of humor. They wouldn’t poke fun at themselves like that. It was 2015 so it was pre-Trump.Second, who made Zero exit out from the back of the plane in China? Foreign countries don’t do that to foreign leaders. Unless of course, the people who are really in charge were trying to send us a message that he wasn’t foreign leader anymore. He had been removed.You have to go back to 2015 and start with reading the posts from FBI Anon, Mega Anon and all the other sock puppets they were using to get out the word. If you immersed yourself in their posts, you realize Q is just a continuation of the same communications strategy.Maybe this all sounds crazy to you guys, but no crazier than the stuff we read on these alternative boards. Crazy stuff we are finding largely to be true.

                    Yeah, that about sums it up for me.  Hun, I’m gonna stop right here and pause reading the commentary for a while.  The postings post assassination attempt have become less than informative and interesting and the crazies seem in ascendency.  As I’ve said before, a few trolls can destroy a discussion section very quickly, as so it has for me.
UNZ is even worse, but that’s to be expected.  However, UNZ comment program allows threads and posters to be blocked and at least one can filter out the good from bad until things die down.

            “If thou striketh the King, strike not to wound”.This is the quote you mentioned although I cannot remember where I first saw it. As per your comment about Haley, I’d have to agree. The big tell is that in a number of quarters her name keeps coming up with regards to a place in Trumps future administration. I keep hearing – usually from a female – “Trump still hasn’t told us what position he’s willing to offer Nikki Haley. He keeps preaching party unity, but people in her former campaign have told us they’ve received no outreach from the Trump campaign.” That type of crap.

        One reason that government policy now feels anti-white is because it generally feels anti-American, but in reality, it is simply indifferent to white Americans.
This is one hundred percent wrong. Public policy is explicitly anti-white. My main fear is Trump will be allowed to win to lure whites back into the fold, particularly for use as cannon fodder in Forever Wars. I have yet to hear any explicit denunciation of a military draft although Vance came close.

            Uh no! Trump “no new wars.”Not just a slogan, because he proved it his first term. If Trump gets back in he will broker a deal with Putin to end the Ukraine fiasco, cut off funding, and tell Zelensky to take a hike.
He will likely calm the sabre rattling with China, because he knows the U.S economy is completely dependent on Chinese manufacturing. Trump’s recent comments on Taiwan suggest his stance is “you’re big boys now, fight your own battles.” You’re position has an element of paranoia to it.

                    I already out lined what I think Trump will do regarding foreign policy. Trump tried to do what he said he would to: the border, returning manufacturing to the U.S. and getting off of dependence on China and the b.s. “free trade” raw deal.You’ve seen him thwarted at every turn, by the swamp and most of his own party.This isn’t the same Trump this time around. He appear’s less naive. He’s learned you can’t make honest deals with the democrats or the swamp,and I think he’ll be less afraid to be the strong man he was accused of being. After everything the system has done to him personally, and surviving the long knives, I think he’ll be more focused and more determined. He’ll also not have the luxury of another term now to implement his agenda. He’ll have to be more expedient.

        “Project Ukraine, for example, is exactly what Washington warned about in his farewell address.”
Project ISRAEL is exactly what Washington warned about in his Farewell Address:
“…nothing is more essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others, should be excluded… The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave.”
Too bad nobody stood up and read that line during all the Israel-fellating at the Republican convention last night…

                That’s a new one on me. I didn’t realize it was the Jews whacking the Kennedys. Makes complete sense that our greatest ally was responsible. Their diaspora has done essentially the same thing to the American economy.

                It’s actually quite shocking how easily the US political system was taken over. You’d think that other countries/groups would follow the blueprint.
When I look at what the Jews have done, it’s not that impressive. They accomplished a lot but, mainly, because they had no competition. They’re an ethnic mafia, that’s all. If another group was willing to use the same tactics, Jews would lose a lot of their power.

                                Kingfisher (can’t speak to any Lite version) is a surprisingly good beer. This despite my not being any fan of Indians.. not by a long shot.
As are Tsingtao, Zhujiang (both Chinese).
Beer Lao (for years, the brewery was the most modern shiny thing in Vientiane — looked like a spaceship had landed in the paddy fields) scores well.
The strangest places have good beers.

                        I got kicked off of twitter for comparing Afro-Aryans (jews) to australoid Aboriginal-Aryans (Brahmins, as the original Dravidian Indians are the same genotype as Australian Aborigines).
These hybrid Aryan mulatto branches are uniquely dangerous in that they leaven Erectus social instincts with White intelligence.

            As Z mentioned, a big part of the problem here is Trump’s base demands support for Israel. It’s been preached to them from the pulpit all their lives. I don’t know if there’s anything we can say (however true) that can overcome that. When I’ve tried, I usually just get those blank stares which indicate communication has ended.

                I usually ask a few questions: in what way are they our greatest ally?  Did they ever fight in a war with us like Great Britain, France, Canada, Australia, etc.? Are they a key trading partner?  Do we share a culture? Are we neighboring countries?  The only response I ever get is that they are the only democracy in the ME.  I then ask how that helps us more than non-democratic countries like Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait.  That’s when I get the blank stares, or something about how hard they had it during the holocaust.

Hamas was elected in democratic elections in Gaza… the American goyim uncritically accept the Jewish propaganda, which tends to omit that inconvenient fact.

                    Yes, it’s amazing to think of it. Israel’s democracy creates vast amounts of economic and political “turbulence” in that region. Give me a good solid Arab dictatorship or monarchy and keep the damn oil flowing! That’s the beginning and end of any legitimate American interest there.

        One reason that government policy now feels anti-white is because it generally feels anti-American, but in reality, it is simply indifferent to white Americans.Affirmative action was rammed down upon us in 1964,  and made even more intrusive by Johnson via totally democratic EO in 1965. That’s 60 years; if we use the standard 20 years as representing a generation we see that three generations of White people have now been actively discriminated against by Ruler fiat, with no end in sight. Doubtless the millions of Whites who were violated through this legislation will be relieved to discover it was not malice that robbed them of opportunity and earning potential, but only indifference. No harm, no foul, Honkey!Concerns over illegal aliens have been a thing since the 1950s. As a result, the Federal government is allowing millions of  foreign Mudmen (to say nothing of their exotic diseases!) to pour across all borders, then using confiscatory taxation monies levied from White people to transport these same aliens into White majority states, cities, and locales. At the same time, Section 8 housing has been weaponized to destroy White enclaves. How many White people have been robbed, raped, and murdered by these alien savages? How many morewillbe? Well, it’s only indifference that fuels all this, so don’t work yourself into a lather about it!The Rulers’ Media organs routinely quash the most horrific stories of black on White violence and murder, while at the same time creating cults of personality around the vilest criminal scum–  George Floyd, Nelson Mandela, Mumia Abu-Jamal, O. J. Simpson, Reginald Denny, the jogger who sparked the term when he went jogging in his work boots. Recently a strong, proud Negress approached a random White woman n an Ohio parking lot and murdered her 3 year old toddler in cold blood. For no reason. Then there was the case of little Cannon Hinnant, little 5 year old White boy shot dead by the N.N.D. (Nigger Next Door). And that little White boy tossed from the third floor balcony at the Mall of America.Crickets.I am betting that even most people on this board have never heard of the Zebra Killings. And yet the Federal Government ran protection for the rioting Mudslide when its propaganda organs whipped them into a murderous frenzy ( no great effort) over St. Floyd.But its just indifference, you understand. State backed riot and property destruction stimulate the economy, and the only inference to be drawn is that the Rulers love money so much that they are willing to suffer the collateral damage of the people for whom the government was created to serve. Sorry, crackers. Its not personal, its only business!Our history is being memory holed before our very eyes. The Charlottesville crowd had legal permits to march in defense of their history, their heroes, and their identity; the Rulers cynically used the event to stoke the White Supremacy, Domestic Terrorist bludgeon which was then turned on Whites as a group. All entertainment is now saturated with the ugly and the alien; niggers are aggressively inserted into all new films and TV shows. Whites in media are depicted as bumbling buffoons, troglodytes, drooling ‘tards; the race mixing has now become officially ubiquitous.The reason they do all these things is indifference. See, they don’t care about us either way, and that is why you and your tribe are under relentless, increasingly aggressive attack every single day. See, they just want to make sure everybody benefits!Now the RNC has featured an alien Mud Woman praying to her pagan god on live TV. All the docile Whites in the crowd obediently bowed their heads and closed their eyes while she invoked the blessings of her demonic deity. JD Vance is married to a “devout Hindu”; there are 1,000 + gods in the Hindu pantheon, so I estimate we will need 2.7 years of consecutive National Conventions to appeal to all of them.The takeaway here is that all of these things (and more besides) are easily explained by the indifference the Rulers have for you, your family, and all that gives spiritual meaning to your existence. People want to talk about peace and love and Societies, pffffft! Give me tariffs, i say! Give me platitudes about ‘the White working class!’ Give me explanations of expediency while Trump is photographed groveling at the Wailing Wall of an alien tribe!Thank God they are only indifferent to me. Dear Lord, what’s going to happen when they start getting hostile?

        As Z notes, the cost of the empire has become too high. As such, our elite will have no choice but to scale back. It was inevitable.The dollar’s place as the Global Reserve Currency allowed us to maintain a ridiculously large military but at the expense of our manufacturing base and the rise in debt.Mass immigration and globalization kept the white working and middle class on their heels and inflation at bay.But those policies were slowly eroding the very society that our elites need to run the world.Our hollowed-out manufacturing base can no longer supply the empire’s military. We are a paper tiger – and the world knows it.Our debt makes use vulnerable to economic disruption while interest costs drain the budget.Globalization allowed the Chinese to become the dominant world economy.Immigration makes our economy 2nd world and destroys patriotism.Whites no longer are willing to serve in the military and will even less willing as the military become minority white.The empire will recede no because our elites will find a new love for Americans but because they will have no choice.

        “Either the reformist elements of the oligarchy embrace America First, or something much worse than Trump comes next.”With the changing demographics in this country and the way that such a development affects voting, I find that final sentence questionable. Besides, the system has proven itself impervious to the results of elections. It appears that Donald Trump’s original term as president had zero impact on how the leviathan actually operates. That Trump obviously is a massive CULTURAL figure/icon blinds people to how inconsequential he has been in terms of how the state manages its affairs. The same bankers, military industrialists, Zionists, and other assorted corporate technocratic sociopaths will remain at the controls independent of which politician/actor pretends to run things from the Oval Office. Trump plays the role of Distractor in Chief. Or he’s the system’s Emmanuel Goldstein. Alternatively, he’s a middle finger for his supporters that feels damned satisfying yet achieves nothing of substance.

Nah, he has been very successful in my opinion. Whether you consider this a plan or is unique ability to goad them into shooting themselves in the foot, we’re at a point right now that an unprecedented number of people feel about the federal government like people in the Soviet Union felt about theirs 30 years ago. They are hanging by a thread and hopefully Trump will follow through and demolish what’s left of it when he steps into the oval Office in January.

                I agree.  Think about all the evil Trump exposed, even if most of it was unintentional.  The first step toward change is getting accurate information.  It might not happen until hard times come, but they cannot re-hide what has been exposed.

        I watched that Glenn Lowry and Charles Murray clip posted yesterday. It is interesting to watch these discussions of the utter verbal abuse of Whites and our civilization. Of course, they didn’t really discuss the mass replacement of our population inside of our homeland.That aside, the point that stands out is this. In every single one of these discussions the the talk is about how they fear the backlash. In other words, what is wrong is that Our dispossession and abuse is not the problem. The problem is that it will spark a backlash.That is how ingrained the Nuremberg Regime is in our culture. Murray and Lowry are good guys. But, even they have so internalized the anti-White morality of the Nuremberg Regime that they can’t just say, “Villainizing White people, replacing them in their own homelands, speaking openly and overtly of their genocide, celebrating their demise is wrong. They built the world that everyone wants to live in. Genociding a people, replacing them demographically is pure evil. We must join with them to stop this.”Now, when they change from fearing the backlash to feeling the outrage we all feel and helping us to institute the backlash we will make progress. You know why? Because that will mean that rather than the world trying to keep the lid on the pot so it doesn’t blow, they will begin actively fighting against the people who are perpetrating this evil. This will require naming names. Of course, that is when the people who instituted the Nuremberg Regime and perpetuate it to their advantage will be named. That means going to war with the real people who lie behind the system.Of course, for Us, Our Moral Subjugation is so complete that we have our own work to do to get it together. No point in waiting around for proxies. Put your mind to becoming that heroic figure who can lead or help lead us. Out of a couple of million doing so, a proper number will realize that effort and millions will be prepared to capitalize on their breakthrough.That Azerrad speech was excellent. He explicitly said no more hiding behind how unfair things are to Asians and other proxies. The dam is breaking. Now, we need White men to start speaking explicitly on our behalf and to rise up and be seen and heard.Let, “The Backlash”, begin.

        “As the cost of empire exceeds the benefit of the empire, the people at the top begin to hollow out that which makes them possible.”Quite so. Maybe there was a time after WW2 when the empire served the majority of white American people but now empire serves only a minority — maybe the top 10 or 15%. The rest of white America is subsidizing the costs of empire. Or as the saying goes, “profits remain private while costs are socialized.” Thus the unfolding debacle in Ukraine has perhaps benefited the military-industrial sector — but at the cost of everyone else. Trump instinctively and viscerally understands this, as does his base of supporters.The reins of empire are in the hands of a rootless, transnational elite, which includes deracinated and disloyal whites. And this elite is cannibalizing white America.On a side note and as an afterthought, I want to say that Trump also understands that the days of empire are waning. Hegemony is gone. Control of the sea lanes is going. Military supremacy is (arguably) gone. The denizens of white America are going to have to transition to a new life in the ruins of empire. But what will the contours of that life be like?

            Military supremacy is gone, in the sense of supporting empire.  There is still military power in the sense of destructive force, but that does not maintain rule over foreign lands.  For that, you need competent boots on the ground, and the US doesn’t have enough of that.  And that’s a good thing.

This.  Did Trump ever use the veto pen?  Not that I recall.  I will vote for Trump just to give the finger to the Regime, but even if he gets back into office, he has shown he’s not very good at the job.

            I think it comes down to if he personally accepts the lone nut narrative the regime is pushing over the hole in his ear.  Hopefully he pulls enough away from boomer truth and finally gets it in his head that we’re at war and his instinct is to fight.

        I’ve heard that “the polls” (whichever ones) are unchanged by recent events. Obviously opinion can be generated and/or selected to send whatever message, but it’s a plausible result.It’s true—or it’s The Message.  What is it?A blatant regime attempt to murder the great symbol of its opposition—of citizen resistance toanything—cost it no votes. The victim’s heroic/mediagenic response to getting shot in the face gained him no one’s consideration. There are not only no undecided voters, but no persuadable Americans.Literal deathmoves no one.I believe it. As I say too often, Democratic voters are far more “extreme” than their politicians, who may be murderous retards but that’s tempered by—i.e.,they waste time on—lust, gluttony, the “favors of office.” By contrast, the average D voter is a full-on psycho demanding constant escalation, more blood, total death, surgical dumps of kids’ dicks piled to the skies, etc.You think your ditzy Democrat daughter who maybe watches too much tv but really she just wants the best for everyone isn’t like that. You are wrong…statistically.

            You are correct. I beat this drum a lot, but the primary problem is quite white. My dream scenario, the most non-violent one possible, is that these types secede. The problem, again as you point out, is that the politicians are less radical than their constituents and want the present situation with its attendant gibs to continue.
I suspect the 2020 election was outright stolen to forestall leftwing secession. I honestly have no clue if that will happen this time.

                No, Jack, you are absolutely right to beat that drum.
As an example, the comments on a dissident site, the Burning Platform.  Despite the author’s good intentions, most of the comment section was /our guys/ flailing about, desperate to shout “Dye patch!”
This is why the rulers are, yes, utterly indifferent to white, middle class Americans.

        John Glubb wrote at length about the final stage of empires.  Corruption and foreigners become prevelant. History repeats repeatedly.
The works of the contemporary historians of Baghdad in the early tenth century are still available. They deeply deplored the degeneracy of the times in which they lived, emphasising particularly the indifference to religion, the increasing materialism and the laxity of sexual morals. They lamented also the corruption of the officials of the government and the fact that politicians always seemed to amass large fortunes while they were in office.

        Slightly off topic, but somewhat related:JD’s parallels to Zero are a little scary. Touted as “a Marine”, he was a journalist like Al Gore. Plucked from obscurity, back bench senator, short timer, Ivy League (Yale vs. Harvard). Connections to Asia a via India for him and Indonesia for Zero. Both were introduced to us through ghost written books that’s springboarded them to the Senate. Billionaire sponsors.Holes starting to appear in his resume. Today, I was reading how he wasn’t very good at private equity.Everything seems to be a media facade these days. Nothing there when you scratch beneath the surface.

                Somebody ran a clip the other day about the Ohio Republican Senate debate and how he said that he was getting closer to his faith and got rebaptized or something like that. Of course, the cynical side of me says he did that to prove that his wife didn’t turn him into a Hindu.

                    It’s a fad among the Thiel-affiliated to become late-in-life Catholics. Maybe he requires it. The obvious joke is that he can’tquiteforce his loyalists to convert to his religion—pederasty—so he demands the nearest thing. Judged by his face, Vance’s conversion was superfluous.Hi-yo!
Honestly I find Thiel nearly incomprehensible because he seems so thoughtless. (“René Girard’s protegé” btw.) But I understand what his companies do: catalog usmalevolently.

                        For us pleb Catholics who really believe the faith (how very gauche), I can only say: God will not be mocked.Dante’s Infero can catch everyone up with what Catholicism really teaches on grooming and homosexuality. Priests per capita are far safer than public school teachers.The small hats did do excellent job at the smear campaign though, regarding the people who the Church was persuaded to take in the first place in part because of their influence.

                    A serious Catholic would never be rebaptized. I am not convinced that all these nominal Catholics in globalists circles are all that serious. They do seem to comfort the elites though and they are rather fond of the art and the intellectual traditions within the faith.

                        i question this assertion that Vance was “rebaptized”. The Catholic Church recognizes every baptism done “in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit”.  He was received into the Church as an adult, as I was, and that does not include baptism for a baptized Protestant Christian.  No Catholic priest would “rebaptize” a Catholic.  As the parent of a child being baptized he will repeat the vows on behalf of his child.

        Are we still not aware elections are rigged?  Trump will be installed, if they want him to be.  And perhaps they do as Ackman and others are balls-out on the Trump train.  Trump unabashedly is pro Israel as we know.
A great irony of Trump, is that at heart he’s just a civ natter and would like nothing more to be legitimized as a respectable republican who lowers taxes, loves legal immigration, and gets people all patriotic and stuff.

            I believe there is a limit to how riggable they are. If Trump were able to flip a couple of traditionally blue states like New Jersey or New Mexico that ought to overcome it. And then there’s the question of what if the riggers themselves aren’t so motivated this time. It doesn’t seem like Biden is inspiring very many people lately.

                To the extent that there are difficulties with rigging, the biggest may be that many people are onto the riggers this time. The 2020 theft caught people by surprise just as much as Trump’s election caught the Power Structure by surprise in 2016. But the mechanics of the 2024 election will be under more scrutiny–the vast majority of it unofficial–than any election in AINO’s history. Anything suspicious will be documented and disseminated. And if the shenanigans are prevalent and obvious enough, and Joey Depends “wins” again, there could be displeasure.

        “or something much worse than Trump comes next.”A retroactive prophesy. They failed to embrace MAGA IN 2017. What followed Trump 45 is absolutely, measurably, objectively, worse. Economy? Worse. Inflation? Massively worse. Foreign affairs? 2.5 new wars. Illegals? 30M invasion. Roads/bridges/infrastructure? Cratering outside of government-controlled enclaves and key Congressional districts. Social cohesion? Worse. Orderly politics? They’re now arresting, jailing and shooting at our candidates.What could be worse than the O’Biden regime? Nuclear war. Economic collapse. Anarchy/color revolution terrorism. Balkanization. American military forces deployed against US citizens in “troublesome” areas.The elite’s version of what comes next was installing a feeb they could control. The next, next? A true villain unemcumbered by physical and mental ailments / stupidity.

        America First is simply government doing what it SHOULD’VE already been doing: The work of making the lives of the people it is supposed to serve better.When I think of all of the good that could done with keeping the billions we’ve spent on the Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan projects, it breaks my heart. Our interstates are pockmarked with suspension shattering ruts and potholes, our bridges are falling apart, crime is rampant in our black-infested hellhole cities and airplanes are falling from the sky. And yet the ruling elites only care about immiserating whites with the climate change mumbo jumbo, limitless immigration to eliminate whites’ self determination, encouragement of sodomy and drug abuse and identity politics (acceptable for all except whites).Our ruling junta is simply a sop for the MIC and Israel lobbies. We are ruled from the shiny office buildings in the DC suburbs and Tel Aviv.I know electing Trump will only be a slight improvement over Biden in a lot of areas, especially when it comes to Israeli matters. But a new Trump administration will likely at least change philosophy of government from anti-white pogroms to something more acceptable.

            “I know electing Trump will only be a slight improvement over Biden in a lot of areas, especially when it comes to Israeli matters.

I’d say temporarily suppress might be a better way of putting it.  Trump is to politics what a painkiller is to stage 4 cancer, temporary relief at best.But this is the best case scenario where Trump actually learns from his first term.  Having picked a never-trumper is proof he learned nothing.  If he wins, prepare to hear daily pronocuncements of the alleged UE rating of women, gays, jews, mestizos, trannies and everyone else except the dreaded White Male. Or how much he supports HBCUs. Maybe some rappers visiting the White House and talking about how great Daddy T is.  I suppose ignored is better than hated, but it’s still not pro-White.

        Great essay – I would just add the following: we are seeing Intra-Elite competition emerging aligned with the America First narrative. It sucks that grass-roots Dirt people cannot accomplish much without significant Elite support. And for sure the movement risks being co-opted by self-interested Elites. But the last few weeks have seen meaningful segments of Silicon Valley and Wall Street get behind Trump/Vance. Unfortunately the best we are likely to do in the short run is get an Elite more focused on domestic concerns. These people want to do business, not fight foreign battles. They’re always going to support Israel, but maybe make less expensive trouble elsewhere.

            This is the best thing coming out of 2024 so far. Finally we are getting a counter-elite. There is something shifting out there. Hopefully it’s permanent and not just a pendulum swing.Compare where we are now compared to this time last year:*DEI is falling by the wayside, one large corporation at a time.*Nationalists (civic or otherwise) are gaining popularity in the West. Not electoral wins yet, but it’s only growing.*Big-money men are starting to talk about meritocracy again. If nothing else, this will fix a lot of problems.*Biden has been embarrassed multiple times, and nobody likes Kamala.*Israel is becoming a bad word.*Right wing media has survived the purges of 2017-2023, and is stronger than ever.*People were worried that Trump would be pushed out of the nominating process or thrown in jail, but none of that’s happened, and he cut through the competition (without even debating them) and PWNS the Republican party now.Not bad!

        This election is far from over for Trump. I fully expect some sort of incident that will be blamed on him and his followers. Like a suicide bombing in a black church where the only remains of the bomber are his red maga cap and his “Fight Fight” t-shirt. Those in power right now must be terrified about the prospect of vengeful OrangeMan conducting an investigation into the attempt on his life – or worse – making Kennedy AG and letting him off the leash. I can’t see a scenario in which the current administration just allows this to happen.

            There’s a sense in which the regime seems to be all bluff. They like to appear totalitarian but they don’t really like to act totalitarian. Seen during the plandemic when they backed down as soon as anybody resisted. A similar feeling seems to be in the air this week. As if the moment the assassination failed, they realized they didn’t have it in themselves to go all the way. I don’t know how or if they can restart the Enemy Of Democracy rhetoric now that they’ve retreated from it. Either you meant it or you didn’t, and if you meant it then you can never tone it down.

This is very easy to imagine happening.
(I am told, but have not verified, that the FBI did a similar bombing in the mid 60s that they blamed on the KKK.)

        Maybe the Regime is indifferent to the average White American in terms of foreign policy goals but the average coastal drone within that hive does hate the average White Heartland American. That has been proven time and time again by their actions and words.The usual suspects running foreign policy and the oligarchs behind them such as Larry Fink of Blackrock aren’t going to slow down or reconsider their goal of bringing Russia to heel, ideally even breaking her up to gain control over her natural resources and just because Trump is in the White House won’t change that.If Trump doesn’t move forcefully to rein in the intelligence complex within Imperial Washington, all of his efforts will continue to be undermined. And I haven’t heard much about his plans to do that. Of course, he knows he can’t breathe a word on that if he has any such plans in that regard and that’s why you see the panic in official Washington because if he does have any such notions, they see that as a threat to their existence. Even the hint of that would set the machinery in overdrive to remove him one way or another.In fact, the real fireworks will begin when someone does come forward to accomplish that. It probably won’t be Trump because every politician since JFK knows the consequences of challenging that entity and Trump is no exception. The political circumstances in Washington would have to be considerably altered for that to happen. Things could unspool quicker than we can imagine or it could take more decades. If the vulture capitalists and their apparatchiks in the intelligence complex give up on their goal of complete world subjugation, and accommodates to the reality of a multipolar world, then maybe things change. Otherwise, no, because the oligarchs and defense contractors pulling the strings aren’t giving up on that goal any time soon. Vultures gonna be vultures.

It is quite incidental that a lot of the kosher-right reaction to the Curious Case of Trump’s Ear is about cancelling mean words on the internet.
“Oh, vey! Some leftard on the internet said he wished the sniper had brained Trump! Shut it down!”

                                That’s dumb.  Photographs and even paintings have long been used as propaganda.  We have really good records going back to WW1.  It probably happened before, it’s just not as well documented.  I’m sure one side of the civil war had the other side’s soldiers painted to look like demons or something.  They probably had recruiting posters with paintings like this. Or “our women” being attacked by the evil enemy.

                                    I can’t express just how much I disagree with him and his cucking.  “Oh, I never cancelled anyone!!!”Make them live by their own rules.  If we can’t have free speech, they can’t have it.Cause that’s the thing with “the left”  All the rules are for us.  The rules do not apply to them. They get to do whatever they want.  “Right wing cancel culture” is awesome and I fully endorse it.  Of course, I still oppose “cancel culture” when it’s used against us.  Be hypocrites.  It’s been 100 years of nonstop hypocrisy from “the left”Screw principles.  The only principle we should follow is do what is good for us and bad for the bad guys.

                                        If the Commies are against free speech and we decide, fuck it, we’re against free speech too, well, nobody is left to defend free speech.There are other ways to hurt our enemies than reinforcing the drama queen mindset that makes cancel culture possible in the first place; once the current purge of random Commie internet celebs is over, it’s still our enemies that sit in the HR departments, the universities, the news rooms and in the investment banks.I approve of double standards; I have one standard for my own family and another one for the neighbor’s, but this is not a random edge issue, free speech is our battleship, our war-winning weapon. Let’s not throw it away.

                                            I’m not saying to abandon free speech for us. Just for them. I support our free speech.  Because right now, the only people supporting it don’t have it. To defend their free speech is to defend the status quo where they have free speech and we don’t. EFF THAT.  It would be far better that we both don’t have it than only they have it.
Of course it would be better if we all had it because we win. We are right and they are wrong.

It’s also right out of their own manual(rules for radicals), which is always make your opponent live up to their own standards.
Besides, there are enough cucks who do denounce what is deceitfully called “right wing cancel culture” to maintain plausible deniability.

No, it’s a poison pill because it reinforces the Leftist frame that being racist is a bad thing. Same thing with reinforcing Karen culture. Censorship is the ring of Sauron, it cannot be used for good. Whenever you wield it for whatever reason, it makes Him stronger.
And the left doesn’t believe in free speech so you’re not making them live up to anything, you’re living down to their standards.

However, I think branding Leftists as anti-white racists more than makes up for it by giving credence to the notion that whites are a distinct group with our own legitimate grievances. If reinforcing racism/evil is a 6 on the badness scale and bolstering white identity is an 8 on the goodness scale, then that’s a plus-2 for white people.
PS–Are we certain censorship is evil? Do we think Putin should have let Pussy Riot do their thing?

That transition might be harder if we’ve spent a decade pretending to be butthurt about being called crackers.And likewise, if we reinforce the notion that words are violence, we muzzle ourselves in the long run, because our overlords will run with it like a nigger with a stolen flatscreen.I would like to see Trump or somebody else with a huge megaphone call them…etc.If I gained control of Trumps earpiece, I’d have him say “I don’t care about the color of your skin, as long as you’re a racist.”Do we think Putin should have let Pussy Riot do their thing?Well, I believe in public decency laws and public order and all that, and for disturbing a church service they’d already earned a “dime”, as Solzhenitsyn called it – ten years in the camps.But on the internet? Yah, let them call for the abandonment of religion or mother Russia or whatever, let them wave their tits around all day and let people call them traitors and kike sluts in return.Whatever we might think about PR, they gave us a rare treat: honest-to-god knout action, right out of Anna Karenina.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXWlQxUNFLYI’d say the guffaws are worth at least six months off their sentence.

That transition might be harder if we’ve spent a decade pretending to be butthurt about being called crackers.”
That’s a bridge I’m willing to burn once we get to it, Felix. Right now, the most important thing is arriving at the bridge and I’m willing to use any tool in the box to get there.

                                                    If it makes anyone feel better, there has never been such a thing as “free speech”. Lefties used it as a modern club to get their way. However, there is always someone censoring speech at all times. The only thing under real discussion (ha!) is who does the censoring for what.Free speech as defined by the Founding Fathers was: The Federal government could not jail state leaders for working against a Federal government gone astray. State leaders were always welcome to censor speech however. What’s in the Bill of Rights existed only at the Federal level generally to protect the sovereignty of the states. Individual rights were secondary and in support of the state rights. (Read 1A and 2A very carefully and you’ll see what I’m talking about.)Now that the states are wholly owned by the Federal government, the Federal goverment can jail state officials for speech against the Federal government, supposedly for the protection of individuals.

And we’ve never had the internet before.
Lefties used it as a modern club to get their way.
And it worked like a charm. Would be a shame to throw that club away, now that we’re the ones fighting The Man.

                        And it’s not Trump as a political figure that’s big and scary, he just looks that way because he’s sitting on top of Godzilla.
The usual suspects are not afraid of Trump – he’s one of their guys after all – they are afraid of a white awakening, and they project that fear and hate onto Trump.

                            Correct. And the members of the Power Structure scare quite easily. That makes them easy to defeat in a pitched battle between roughly equal forces, but reckless and exceedingly dangerous when they own the heavy battalions.

                    Riding the monster, yes.  But he had to put a large enough saddle on it to hold his balls.  He is married to a super model and owns his own golf courses.  He does not need to risk his life, freedom and wealth just to pad his ego.  There is a much higher reason he is risking so much.

                        He’s married (for the third time) to a retired sex worker cum executive mail order bride, whom for some reasons Americans think is Jackie Kennedy reincarnate, just because she doesn’t dress like a burlesque dancer.And the fact that he’s a millionaire only makes him more suspect, because the more you have, the more you’ve got to lose.Trump 2016 was an aberration, he was signed up as a side show and was not supposed to win, so he didn’t take his own campaign very seriously. Trump didn’t as much mount Godzilla as Godzilla noted him making vague, pro-giant lizard noises, grabbed him in its jaws and flung him into the White House, along with his whore wife.Now we’re dealing with another man because this time, he IS supposed to win, and that means he has reached an agreement with a powerful faction of the usual suspects, who will want their pound of flesh.I still can’t get over Saturday, I swear we’re in a movie script and being railroaded somewhere bad, that there’s a big plot twist coming soon.

                            A bit harsh, Felix.  A fashion model is a “whore”, a man risking everything is “more suspect, because the more you have, the more you’ve got to lose”, and a man who was an inch away from being murdered by the usual suspects “has reached an agreement with a powerful faction of the usual suspects.”  You are a usually very sharp observer, but you might be having an off day.

                                Alright, “whore” is technically incorrect, but “sex worker” isn’t.I admire Melania for the grit, smarts and determination that bought her a ticket out of a dilapidated Warsaw Pact country as soon as the Iron Curtain fell, and carried her all the way to the White House.But still, seeing her as FLOTUS rubs me the wrong way. Speaking as a bigoted Germanic, the first Eastern Europeans who came West after the Wall, were Slavic prostitutes and farm workers; Melania is of that generation and she doesn’t look like much of a farm worker to me.As for the ear-business, I’m letting it all hang out and say it’s fake, pending further data – getting my hedge in before I place my bet, so to speak. That way, I’ll look awfully clever if I’m right, and if I’m not, we can just forget I ever said it.

Very good point, although I’ve nothing against Nancy – I assume “Lady Bird” is Eleanor, because she’s pretty much the worst of the bunch.

                                            Lady Bird was LBJ’s wife.  Eleanor was FDR, before Jackie. She was awful, but it’s hard to rank anyone worse than Hillary.  Actually, Laura Bush was fine, other than having the terrible judgement to marry a drunk, who along with his appointee justice John Roberts (overseer of the kangaroo FISA courts), set up the modern domestic spying apparatus, and is the reason this post is being added to my NSA potential terrorist file.
BTW, none of the downvotes are mine, as I enjoy your comments even when I disagree.

                                                    Yes, many modern conservatives are in love with Melania. I admire her for the same reason that you do. Clearly she intended to get out of the poverty of home and make it. She did it, with the rings on her fingers to prove it.However, one of the elite objections to Trump is that he’s low class in every way possible. His current wife, at very best, is from a class of women that we used to call gold diggers. She certainly has no problems mostly disrobing in front of cameras.She might be otherwise an honest and pleasant woman who raised her son well. Gold diggers can come to genuinely love their husbands. I hope she is all that.However, America is so degenerate right now we can’t even see that a 3rd wife with her background is not about new American royalty. It’s about very possibly Trump tripping over the very last pretty woman who might have him as husband, given his personality and previous marriages. It’s all very low status, including the 3rd marriage.Everyone is talking about Vance’s wife in part because she is a high status wife in modern America.

        I wrote a long, eloquent refutation of this “only indifferent to Whites” nonsense, but it was eliminated by moderation. I presume it was because I used the taboo N-word voodoo. Which only further amplifies my point that we are very much second class citizens, and indifference hasnothingto do with that.
TBF I assume this was the platform muzzling my Crime Think, and not the Z Man.

                I dunno, I frequently disagree with Z’s take, but it seems to me he allows pretty free reign out here on the board.
Z may be wrong, but I will defend to the point of very mild inconvenience that he allows the rest of us the chance to do the same.
I’m betting its a hiccup with the new commenting whatsit. Especially after my post magically re-appeared.

        Look (as all the Washington pundits say) if we can’t recognize that this Thing is wrapping up right now, then what’s to talk about? Z Man, you’re taking a long-view here, yes? As in, there will come a time when it’s transactionally-more self-interested to ignore American Zionist concerns, and at that time, pragmatic politicians (not necessarily Trump, because this isn’t happening anytime soon) will shift their policy preferences.I’m thinking we really don’t have that kind of timeline based on the events of the past ten years and particularly the last week. And Biden’s just getting started after the RNC wraps up.It’s not normalcy bias, but…I really don’t see this holding together after the election. Once it settles in on the Trump Crowd that his sun is setting soon, they will realize that the Boomers are going, and it’s their responsibility now. White Americans do not want to do the work to save what’s left of their heritage. Trump is theirParade MagazineElvis plate on the wall. What happens when they can’t order it any longer?It’s what they used to call a “Come To Jesus Moment,” but in our time, it’s going to be a “Run From Jesus Moment.” I’m really not sanguine about post-November, honestly. I see bills ceasing to be paid and a lot of social unrest appearing in venues where it’s previously mostly been verboten, such as the workplace and (again, mostly) the roadways.

        Symbolically, a second Trump presidency at least puts the foreign and domestic policies you reference in your article Z “on the table.” Trump will be on the bully pulpit preaching, and the MSM and D’s will be screeching. Although you are correct that the swamp will do whatever they can to thwart all of Trump’s efforts, the normies being exposed to these policies on the regular due to the daily battle can’t hurt or make anything worse. Trump putting these recycled paleocon policies back into public discourse in 2015, did open a lot of eyes, and create a lot of energy in the right direction. Especially with the juxtaposition between Trump’s first term vs the last 3 1/2 years of Biden. People are more pissed off right now than I can remember in my entire life time.That’s how Trump won the first time. Trump may not save America, but at least he has exposed what the battle lines are, and increased the speed and intensity of either a secessionist movement or civil war. Either of those scenario’s brings about the end of the gridlock on power of the D.C. cabal and a breakdown of the current system. Either in my book is a win.God damn it all, if all we’ve got is bread and circus’s does it get any better than Trump vs the evil empire?

        Vance is even less scary to the political class than Trump ought to be.  Even if Trump wins and gets into office without the system taking him out, he will mostly govern like a run of the mill Republican.  Anything he does that they don’t like they can block easily or at worst, undo it in 2029.Better yet, there hasn’t been an official recession since 2009, other than 2 extremely short minor 1 quarter slowdowns.  We’ve printed at least 15 trillion Dollars since then.  If the era of cheap money implodes under Trump, well, just blame Trump and not only is he no longer a threat, but “maga” is also no longer a threat and will be discredited.

        “The odds of Trump winning are not good…”
Why would globo-homo actors attempt an assassination if Trump’s odds of winning are not good? Why bother?
“…despite all of the good things breaking his way.”
I doubt Trump is so lucky, CNN forgot how to do propaganda.

            Agree. The Trump shooter was no mythical lone wolf, he’s a copy and paste Lee Harvey Oswald patsy without the gravita’s and experience.
If the swamp has the election fix in hand, not only did they not need to try and take him out, every failed attempt to take Trump out politically and now literally has backfired and only benefited Trump. The Swamp is running scared.

            At the moment, Trump is probably outside theplausiblemargin of fraud in a race against Biden, but there are other factors in play. A foreign crisis, economic distress, “natural” disasters, “terrorism” or even another assassination attempt could reset the board.  If Biden withdraws, the entry of a new Democratic candidate could re-energize the party. However, it is difficult to imagine younger Democrats like Newsom, Whitmer or Shapiro wasting their shot by running against a presumably invincible Trump.
I will merely note, as have others, that the Blood Countess of Chappaqua has been very quiet of late. Too quiet.

                Noticed the slight shilling going on, too. He’s probably got some under-the-table money coming in from a Trump-related entity. It’s not a negative accusation, per say, I merely suspect a lot of mature, non-insane political voices who’ve been cast into the void might be being courted somewhat. Sailor got brought back after all.

A black man said the power of prayer is what turned Trump’s head at that crucial millisecond. The prayer of millions altered reality; an unscripted glance, 1/20 of a second, and we would’ve been in a different world right now.
I accept this as true, it accords with all I’ve found. We are in a spiritual battle of dueling realities and different gods.
To describe such as this hand or that hand at work is only a semantic difference. ‘Tis the Hand that turned that man’s head.

                Z has mentioned in the past that Trump has top-tier political instincts (which is correct) and that he supports the people who expose the corruption of and do maximal damage to the current Regime. If some Democrat were doing this, like a better version of Tulsi Gabbard or RFK Jr, I think Z and many of us would be “respecting” him or her too.
It doesn’t matter if the Trump-Vance ticket disappoints you. What matters is the people that want to kill you also want to kill them. That should blessedly focus our efforts.

        ”If Evangelicals stop worshiping Jewish people, Trump will be less enthusiastic for Israel, because Israel stops being important domestically.”This is an invaluable word of warning &amp; advice, Trump or otherwise.

        It all goes back to counterfeit assignats.The French Revolution was…a real estate scam.In order to break the Catholic heart of the Holy Roman Empire, which was France, the same banking interest that financed England’s first Parliament promoted the confiscation of Church properties in France.The Terror wasn’t to scare the peasants. It was to scare the aristocrats into leaving, and leaving their properties behind as well.An unlimited supply of counterfeit paper assignats then bought up those Church and landry properties at a steep wartime discount; they were resold for hard gold, and that gold ended up in the autonomous City of London and some say the Vatican as well.One can trace this path through the Bank of England created in 1694, the Bank of North America created in 1781, and the FED created in 1913…including even the industrialists’ financing of both Lenin and Small Moustache Man.Ultimately we come to today’s scaffold of “the ‘City of London’ as the enemy’s secular HQ and financial power arm of the enemy…(Masonic) DC and the MIC are the enforcers, and The Vatican is the religious arm.”PR people like Rosseau and Sartre, religious movements, political agents, etc. are part and parcel of the millenia long Culture War against the Aryans that results in empire, the building up of Horses to ride and the beatings or death of them.Is the chicken/egg question of cycles inherent or emergent in the structure; for instance, are the Protestant movements more a cause, or a result, of Gutenberg’s printing press?I say parasites, or empire, are both inherent and emergent in the structure.How then to accomodate this? Stoicism, prediction, and preparation for reaction?Would that I had the moral comfort of rightness to fortify my striving.———————————The assignat scam -blog starts here:https://gamousseau.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/the-assignat-scam/A series of short Zman length vignettes from a defunct work; a relatively quick read, I myself couldn’t put down the sordid history behind our history. It starts with the Revolution to the present.

        “The reason this terrifies official Washington is that all of their projects and therebefore their reason to exist rest on the assertion that overseas concerns are paramount because they serve the interest of the empire. If politics moves to a debate about what is and what is not good for the American people, suddenly these schemes not only stop making sense, but they also sound un-American. Project Ukraine, for example, is exactly what Washington warned about in his farewell address.”

            Election’s don’t matter is akin to Trump derangement syndrome.Of course they matter. When the swamp gets a politico friendly to their agenda. It makes things easier for them. With a guy like Trump they have to work overtime.

        Pardon me for being optimistic, but I notice that America First or MAGA has done a mostly exemplary job these last few years (J6 aside) of refusing(either through discretion or sloth)to take the bait and denying the Borg the casus belli it seeks. As this has gone on, the Borg is slowly becoming infected/corrupted by America First/MAGA to some degree, which wouldn’t have been possible if bait had been taken. Yet as AF/MAGA corrupts the Borg, simultaneously the Borg corrupts it. This has led to more, but certainly not all or close to all, of AF/MAGA’s interests being represented by the Borg, with more to come. Some percentage of a loaf, but it never will be the whole thing, as too much of the “country” is too far gone. Perhaps in this fashion the “republic” can stagger on for a while without any major calamity that threatens us all.

        Despite being a generally one-note accelerationist, I am much more sanguine about Trump’s chances — so long as he has additional security watching his security’s security.
I have also persuaded myself that Trump cannot make worse appointments than he did last time.  Especially if Don Jr has a hand in their vetting.  A second Trump administration may look more like a clan affair than anything we have yet seen.  But to what use would such an organization be put?  They seem to be thinking long-term, but what are they thinking?

        So true about the ‘cosmopolitan’ politicians. That makes me think of the AOC and Nadler press conference to address the huge influx of illegal immigrants coming into the city and they thought they would calm the people’s concerns about it by telling them all the things they were going to do for the immigrants!
They didn’t address their own constituency that they were standing in front of once. It was a sight to behold, and they got shouted down and out of their own press conference, deservedly.

        OT re: Crooks’ motivations, from NYT FWIW.
“But in the aftermath, when the F.B.I. was able to finally access Mr. Crooks’s cellphones and other electronic devices, agents could see that he had searched for images of Mr. Trump as well as President Biden, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and even F.B.I. Director Christopher A. Wray.
Mr. Crooks also typed in “major depressive disorder” and searched for dates and places for appearances for both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump.”

                    Maybe that’s the way the board software runs. Sometimes you can set the filters to slow people down so they don’t hog the board. I’m guilty of that sometimes myself when I’m on a roll. Everyone now and then, I get one that gets bumped into the approval queue. I have no idea what it is I do–haven’t figured the pattern out yet and I’m usually good at that. The other day I typed, “hëad wrāp” and “SSDeeDee”. I wonder if that’s what threw me into the queue.
