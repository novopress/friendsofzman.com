        Two points:1. Those goofy costumes that people in the 19th century imagined for the future actually don‚Äôt seem so crazy if you picture the wearers as avant-garde artists or rock stars. I can easily see David Bowie, Bootsy Collins, or Lady Gaga in one of those get-ups. And you should take a look at some of the weirder things fashion designers come up with for the catwalk. Fashion show pics come across in big batches on the AP wire at my work, and a lot of it is just completely insane. Those imagined costumes would fit right in at Paris Fashion Week. But as far as clothes for the masses, yeah, the point stands.2. ‚ÄúHe was one of the few people in a position to see and exploit the mortgage bubble.‚Äù Key phrase there is ‚Äúand exploit.‚Äù I was living in Florida at the loopy heights of the mortgage bubble, and it was blindingly obvious to me and a lot of other folks here that the whole thing was a classic bubble. When the guy down the street has a house twice the size of yours but no visible job or means of income (and based on his manners and taste, is clearly not some upper-crust dolt living off a trust fund), you notice. When you see whole neighborhoods of people like this, you notice. Unlike most other parts of the country, Florida already bears the very visible physical scars of a long, long string of real estate booms and busts, so it wasn‚Äôt like people who knew a little bit of local history couldn‚Äôt recognize what was going on. I remember thinking about ‚ÄúTulipmania‚Äù a lot during those years. But being able to see it and being able to exploit it are, alas, two different things. It kind of sticks in my craw when I read stories about these finance guys boasting about how they saw the bubble when nobody else did. No, lots of people saw that bubble; they just didn‚Äôt have $200 million in investment capital they could use to bet on the outcome.

        High paying jobs (for some in the following fields) that didn‚Äôt 15 years ago:App DeveloperMarket Research Data MinerEducational or Admissions ConsultantsMillennial Generational ExpertSocial Media ManagerChief Listening OfficerCloud Computing ServicesElder CareSustainability ExpertUser Experience DesignABA TherapistsAnd there are many more new ones &amp; expanding old ones including dog walkers.Humans have infinite desires which will not end. I expect the trend towards more work in the services will continue to increase, and gov handouts seem to grow so there certainly may be more people on the dole, not because there is nothing to do, but because the gov dole is good enough for them.

            What you are listing there is mostly busy work. Most of government is busy work. Much of corporate work is government mandated busy work. That sounds fine, until you realize communism collapsed because it was based on busy work. Modern political-economy in the West is based on efficiency, or the elimination of busy work.
Something is going to have to change.

                While not defending ‚Äúbusy work‚Äù and even agreeing it is an economic drag, robots are assumed to increase productivity allowing more busy work while still growing the economy for all. The fall of communism was, in part, because they could not produce real wealth to offset the busy work. If you have a dad (nation) growing increasingly rich you can support more indolent offspring (‚Äúbusy work‚Äù).From the pre-industrial age when ~90% were working the land, we‚Äôve grown increasingly rich and have increased the % of ‚Äúbusy work workers.‚Äù We‚Äôve not been eliminating busy work, we‚Äôve been adding it. This is not to say government will not continue to excess no matter what productivity gains we muster resulting in our fall ‚Äì it certainly seems so inclined.Except for some the robots are no problem. Robots will likely enable prolonging &amp; expanding the inefficiencies of increasing numbers for some considerable time. As written, I guess more will be satisfied with welfare alone ‚Äì satisfied enough to limit their efforts to voting for free lunches. Yet because of infinite human desires, productive work will likely be available. If I can get a little more productive I‚Äôll hire a housekeeper &amp; that is no more busy work than my barber. I have a wife, but she says she is busy working.

                    @ tex ‚Äì No robot will do busy work because no one will spend the time, money and resources it takes to develop a robot to do that sort of work. People, on the other hand, are very good at it!And I would disagree that welfare will ever be satisfying. Not working, despite all the so called perks associated with it, only demotivates people into a worse condition over time. People are by nature creative. Just watch any child with a piece of paper, a box of crayons and some glue. You don‚Äôt have to teach them how it all works, they know how to be creative. While some are naturally better than others, it‚Äôs creativity, expressed through work, that defines us. Take away our definition, and we are nothing.

                        @Karl:Without getting too involved, it depends upon ‚Äúwhat the definition of is is‚Äù kind of thing. Robots are just computers that move. Computers do busy work. I program them to do busy work, saving humans many hours of busy work so they can do even more of it, or sit around more, I guess. The disk arm moves furiously sometimes, which is little different than a big robot moving stacks of the Federal Register around.The defn thingy: Most are not satisfied enough with welfare to sit back &amp; say how sweet. Many proclaim, life sucks because of all you rich guys &amp; big corps, so gimme more. But they are satisfied enough not to DO anything about it, and as (&amp; if) we become richer pols will take more &amp; dole out more for more people on the dole. There is some police dept where most retire on disability at 45 living on generous pension &amp; healthcare thereafter. When I went to college I met a bunch of hippies who mostly humped, smoked grass &amp; avoided work. A pot head son of an upper class family knocked up his gf &amp; they do well on welfare while living free at home (his dad wants him out, but his mom will not stand for it with her grandchild). Satisfied in my book. In some ghetto the natives were demonstrating against Asian grocers who followed them watching for theft &amp; they were really mad. So mad, they opened their own little grocery ‚Äì but that was temporary, they were not about to really put forth the Asian‚Äôs work themselves. Perhaps the defn of ‚Äúnothing‚Äù but I expect more of ‚Äôem as we grow richer. That is not a good thing, but my prediction, and as written &amp; you describe above, it ain‚Äôt necessary, but will likely be so IMHO.

                            @ Tex ‚Äì I suspect the truth of the welfare state is probably more in line with your explanation. We have the same situation (as do all western industrialized countries) We have the same thing here, people who simply refuse to work. As long as people can get free stuff for nothing, it will continue. The bleeding heart liberals will play the pity card, while forcing the rest of us to pay for them.I am not against taking care of people who can‚Äôt take care of themselves. It‚Äôs a social responsibility we have as wealthy, successful countries to care for the sick and elderly who have no means to care for themselves. And even to some degree for those who are on hard times. But there‚Äôs a big difference between those in need, and those who just want.I still support the idea that if one is on public assistance, there should be work associated with it. There are plenty of streets to clean, road side stops that need to be tidied up. We already pay these people, why not get something back for it. I think you Americans had a program back in the 1930‚Äôs that was quite successful. They should consider bringing it back..

        The concept that artificially intelligent beings would rapidly become bored with humans, ignore us and move on to the rest of the universe is predicated on the assumption that they would be able to find a way to actually travelthrough space.  Even a mechanical being might not last long enough to get far if limited by light speed.  They may see humans as nothing more than competition for resources on a planet they haven‚Äôt found a way to leave and decide to eliminate us.

        [‚Ä¶] The reality is a race (is race the right word?) of super intelligent robots would quickly lose interest in humans. From the perspective of the robots, humans would be as interesting to them as ants are to us. Maybe a few weirdo robots would make a hobby of studying us, but otherwise, the robots would have bigger fish to fry. Assuming an¬†ever accelerating evolution of their intelligence, the robots will depart soon after they become aware. The universe is just too big and interesting to hang around with the talking monkeys. keep reading‚Ä¶. [‚Ä¶]

        I remember watching a tv show in the late 80‚Äôs, totally can‚Äôt recall the name, but it was that type of show like Ancient Aliens. Anyhow, a guy on it, a little goth looking, was billed as a world-renowned Vampirologist. Cue raucous laughter. To this day I chuckle about it if I hear any word that ends in ‚Äúologist‚Äù. With the exception of true professions ending in such.

            There was a famous TV ad in the 90s in the UK where a concerned grandmother is awed by the fact her grandson  (despite failing at anything useful in education) got a pass in sociology, and pleased, she comes out with the line: ‚Äúyou get yourself an ology and you are a scientist!‚Äù

Karel ƒåapek sold this in 1920 with his play RUR. In fact he or his brother invented the term ‚ÄúRobot‚Äù for this play.
