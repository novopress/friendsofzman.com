        The Roman Republic eroded when there were no longer enough Roman citizens left to singly  bear responsibility in defending Rome from the German tribes, much less from increasing Empire. First the proles were included in the new deal, then the barbarians. Bread and circus’s next. At least we can say this for the Romans–the Empire lasted longer than the Republic. Not going to happen that way here.

        “The beginning of the end of the Roman Republic was when the ruling class loss respect for their own rules. Scholars don’t frame it like that because it’s hard and boring.”Actually, I don’t think this assertion is true, since I’ve written abook on the fall of the Republicthat does discuss the impact of the implications for the military recruitment system of the large-scale importation of slaves but at the same highlights the breakdown of the traditional civic order as a major element in the ultimate failure of the system. And I can assure the prose is not “boring”!If you want, send me an email and I’ll mail you a copy of the book. It’s the least I can do, since I frequently copy over amusing quotes from your blog onto my FB page for the enlightenment and/or annoyance of my SWPL friends.

        I recently wrote a piece on Oscar Wilde explaining that he had been imprisoned, not for sodomy, but for vulgarity.  No one cared that Wilde liked to bugger rent boys.  They cared that he brought his rent boys to dinner at the Cadigan Hotel.  They cared that he was making a public spectacle of himself, sniggering and chortling with a superior air, flaunting his vice.  He had to be put down, in the harshest manner possible.  In the movie WILDE, an elderly aristocratic lady states, “if an aristocracy cannot set the example, what’s the point of having one?”  Exactly.Just a few decades later the Bloomsbury crowd was publicly advocating and openly flaunting the types of attitudes and activities that got Wilde two years of hard labor.  Instead of being pilloried, they were hailed as liberators.  This lapse was a harbinger of things to come.  The mighty English ruling class, effete, arrogant, and unmoored, then proceeded to wreck the economy, stumble into the meat grinder horrors of two world wars, and destroy the Empire.  By 1950 they were finished, and rightly so.Look at England today.  You’d never know they once ruled the world.  It doesn’t seem possible.
