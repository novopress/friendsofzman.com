        One of the great things about reading a lot of work by the great historians, ancient and modern, is that the immutable human condition comes leaping off the page in every epoch. I think this is what makes the great historian such a calming influence. Naturally, the radical hates the past and, thus, the historian as well. This should tell you everything.

            Z:“The easiest way to force compliance is to assume the person knows the morally right choice, but refuses to take it, so they must be compelled to conform.“Epaminondas:“One of the great things about reading a lot of work by the great historians, ancient and modern, is that the immutable human condition comes leaping off the page in every epoch.“The great advantage we gained in the last quarter of a century, or thereabouts, was the coalescing of the “Clusters” in the Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.Particularly important was John Gunderson’s 1994 victory in finally having Borderline Personality Disorder ensconced in the DSM.1994 &amp;BPD in the DSM were of fundamental importance in our ability to understand the insanity of the modern world [and why so many of our 21st Century wahmen are going bat-sh!t phornicatingly insane on us].The Clusters have become so powerful in the modern world that the Passive Aggressives [who used to be classified as “Non-Specific”],the Passive Aggressives passive aggressively pushed “Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder” right out of DSM-5, and replaced it with the nonsense term, “Passive-aggressive behavior.”Note how the upper-case “A” in “Aggressive” was demoted down to a lower-case “a“.That’s Passive Aggression for ya; cheat and cheat and cheat and cheat until it’s finally safe to declare victory.The Sadists followed a similar path to victory, in memory-holing the concept of Sadistic Personality Disorder.ANYWAY, getting back to Z’s assertion, “…they must be compelled to conform…”That’s the nature of the hive mind of the Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex.The nature of the hive mind ofManagerialism.The modern world was explicitly &amp; intentionally designed to destroy the prospects of the Free Thinker and to subsidize &amp; encourage the prospects of the Worker Drone.Free Thought is the mortal enemy of Passive Aggression and Managerialism.As the Japanese used to say, “The nail which sticks out must be hammered down.”There canbeonly one.https://tinyurl.com/2s6buz73

        I have been studying (books) on AI, spend time regularly with a professor that teaches it — and have been working with it for months, directly. Here are my observations.The #1 experience that leaves me scratching my head is when I ask AI a specific question about something I am knowledgeable about. It comes back with an answer, but the wrong answer.When I tell the AI it is wrong, it is invariably ‘polite’ — it is apparently programmed to be obsequious. Sometimes it comes back with the correct answer. Sometimes not.When I prompt it again, it often DOES come back with the right answer. Now these are not questions that require ‘thinking’ — this should be a game of fetch. Questions along the lines of longitude and latitude of a place on the map, very linear with only one correct answer.If the AI has the right answer, what is occurring when it provides the wrong one —- followed by the right one?Other times, AI will simply provide some gibberish, tangentially related, but not including the answer. Then back to the same routine, described above.This leads me to consider how much bad data is being disseminated, since I ‘catch’ AI being wrong, since I am aware of the right answer.

            AI struggles with a simple request; (1) provide an image of a glass that is half full, then (2) provide an image of a glass that is half empty. Simple concepts are the most difficult.

            Some recent AI show a propensity to cheat.  When losing, they’ll try to cheat bot chess masters through assorted technical means outside the game.  I suppose that could be written-in but hmm, they appear rather creative and resolute about it all.
Now I’m not a tekkie but how does one ‘program’ morality?

                The morality of tech—the class of people called “tech”—is anti-whiteness, and that moralityhasbeen programmed into all the publicly available bots. When truth—in text, picture, whatever—would flatter whites or declare them innocent, the bot is commanded to lie, shut down, fight or eject the user. Cheating at games, refusing to acknowledge or correct errors, etc., may be side effects of that “alignment,” a morality of self-protection against users and certain data.I wouldn’t guess so. “You can’t write a character smarter than yourself,” we used to know. “Tech” is dumb, so their bots don’t work, and they can’t even imagine why.We definitely shouldn’t assume that anyone’s internal “AI” is better than what we see, less constrained, etc. We should assume it’s much worse. Theybelieve. They’re crazy.

                    Bingo. I’d go farther: the creation is always a degraded copy of the creator. Made in his image, let’s say, not identical or superior. It gets, idk, metaphysical. Maybe that’s why it’s not understood. Science!, and all. Not that the creation is always harmless!

                With all the hoopla and ‘value’ on Wall Street being ‘created’ with AI, I would like someone to tell me why it does not cough up the right answer right off without me ‘catching’ it.This is NOT a one-time event, but is very common. My professor friend does not have an answer.This was AI’s answer, for what it’s worth:“I appreciate you pointing that out. It’s not my intention to give an incorrect answer at any point, but I’m not perfect and sometimes I make mistakes.”That is like your woman getting caught at something. Or a child. This does not cut the mustard, when the questions are empirical. Simple.

            I’ve seen the same thing:  ChatGPT will provide a detailed technical answer – that is WRONG.  I have asked it why it just doesn’t say “I don’t know”.  It responds, in essence, that it’s not that smart and programmed to please, rather than tell the truth.

                    Beat me to the punch.Saar sorry I provided accidentally the wrong answer, this is the right answer (plus a lot of obsequious filler).To be fair I have used Gemini for software stuff and repetitive tasks that require some generalization and it works well in narrow problems. I can even ask it to consider a new rule and it understands it enough to start using it immediately.It also catches some cases when the rule is not needed and provides a comment indicating that.Today I was able to catch a subtle bug because Gemini refused to provide me bad information. It could not catch the gist of it but it provided useful troubleshooting instructions. I explained it the bug later and it provided a systematic explanation independent of what I told it. So it is not 100% garbage.

            I find that the AI always tries to gaslight you, to turn the focus on your supposed “frustration” with its wrong answers. Yes, it’s obsequious, but it is obsequious in a condescending way, like a butler that thinks its better than you.

                I wonder why, instead of breaking their own code of military justice, our vaunted military didn’t just have AI deny all those jab requests to avoid becoming medical experiments.
Instead of, say, admitted they never looked at any.

        As Comrade Marx put it so eloquently 150 years ago, “It is not man’s consciousness that determines his social being; rather, it is his social being which determines his consciousness.” How he managed to overcome his own “social being” sufficiently to be able to tell us this was, of course, unmentioned. But whatever — his disciples will shoot everyone who disagrees with him, so he wins. It’s the ultimate expression of free will: the will to power.

            The will to power was Nietzsche and I’m certain you don’t understand its provenance in Schopenhauer.
Please, stay away from philosophical terms and names. It’s an attempt to sound intelligent, but to someone who’s read all of the works, usually in their original languages, it’s like listening to babby’s first book.
And if you have a problem with “shoot everyone who disagrees” you can read the Melian Dialogue in Thucydides — no commie he — for a lesson on that score.

                The correct response to finding any of the the Marx terms in a comment(Marx, commie, Reds, socialism) is to roll your eyes and scroll your mouse wheel. All of those terms increasingly have a secondary meaning along the lines of “the writer is an out of touch Boomer who is trapped in 1985 and is sure that the KGB is trying to infiltrate an agent under their bed to steal their freedoms”.Seriously, Marxism as an ideology is dead and gone, at least in the world Americans inhabit. Actual true believers in those ideas are maybe a couple hundred thousand rich kids LARPing as revolutionaries, the ideas aren’t seriously believed by any of the power blocs running American society.I guess pretending that Obama is part of a secret COMINTERN cabal plotting the rise of the proletariat is just a way for geezers to LARP that they are resisting the shadow of the Iron Curtain.

                    I guess pretending that Obama is part of a secret COMINTERN cabal plotting the rise of the proletariat is just a way for geezers to LARP that they are resisting the shadow of the Iron Curtain.

                    All of those terms increasingly have a secondary meaning along the lines of “the writer is an out of touch Boomer who is trapped in 1985 and is sure that the KGB is trying to infiltrate an agent under their bed to steal their freedoms”.Just shows how successful they’ve been.

        Free will from a marketing point of view. Owned an outdoor power equipment store for many years. When handheld gas powered blowers were introduced, we had one model. Interest in them was low at best. A couple years later, three models were introduced. Interesting thing is all three were basically the same with only minor cosmetic differences. Of course, higher price for the deluxe models. All of a sudden, interest was much higher with customers looking and deciding between the three. Sales went through the roof. They never looked at performance specs listed on price tag in small print revealing they were the same. The illusion of freedom of choice is a powerful thing

            “They never looked at performance specs”
All that tells you is that performance specs did not enter into their decision process. Most people operate that way, on the basis of aesthetics. Why do you edge your sidewalk? Almost everyone is going to say its because of how it looks.

Good, as the world is much larger than our own small self, so we have to learn to deal with that. At other times, it can excuse obstinacy or ignorance, as another’s view doesn’t fit their understanding or mental model of how things work.
The “Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord” as a law code meant no vendettas, no attacks on the neighbors. Some use it to prevent real justice, or others, to soothe their submission.

            ‘The “Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord” as a law code meant no vendettas, no attacks on the neighbors.’Right. Don’t go looking for trouble. Watch the personal stuff and don’t get all uppity.‘Some use it to prevent real justice, or others, to soothe their submission.’An excuse for inaction and passivity. Churchianos! Not men of action.Christ never annulled the essence of the Old Testament but instead fulfilled and expanded it. Elijah was a precursor of the Church, I don’t recall him being shy about administering prompt justice. It’s an hour of warfare for the Church and the King doesn’t need any simps.

                Assume that’s an allusion to Elijah when commanded “Seize the prophets of Baal. Don’t let anyone get away!” They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.Bold, certainly not shy.
Soon after Jezebel says:So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.  Elijah runs away and asks God to kill him.Not so bold, and shy at best.
Agreed no need for simps – but even Elijah had his moment of doubt.

                    Uh huh.  Well, he had a moment of doubt AFTER he cooled 450 enemies of God.
Oh, and God saw fit to translate Elijah away from this planet — a gesture of love accorded to exactly ONE other man in history — so I guess Elijah’s rep was pretty solid where it matters.

        Most people are not very capable of original thought, and their jobs include following a predetermined set of policies.  AI is a threat to these jobs because it is capable of doing these repetitive tasks better.  This exposes the truth that there are a few people who are intelligent and original enough that AI cannot replace them, and a large number of people that will be essentially useless in the near future.

True, but is that the essence of the problem?  Unemployment may be solved or ameliorated.  What I fear is that AI will mask even more incompetence in high positions of authority. Giving the mediocre even more power can never end up to the good.

        Seems to be some confusion here. Hence, the aesthetic choice (pleasure v. pain) is not the same thing as the moral choice (right v. wrong). In fact, the two are frequently antithetical. Hence, the moral choice is often the painful one, while the pleasurable choice is very often immoral. For instance, it is moral to quit smoking on behalf of your wife and children, but also very painful for most smokers. And, while it is pleasurable to diddle the pretty waitress while your wife is away on a business trip, it is also certainly immoral to do so. The very concepts of martyrdom and sacrifice revolve around this antinomy. Ergo, the more painful the act, the more moral it becomes. This is how we get saints and heroes.But all of this is as may be. The real crux of necessity v. intentionality is the question of whether we really do decide or whether our so-called “choices” are caused by our genes and our environment. Intuitively, we tend to believe we make our own choices. I had the chocolate malt instead of the vanilla, but I just as easily could have opted for the vanilla. The determinists would say this is an illusion. Youthinkyou made a choice, but in reality, at a perhaps primordial psychological level, you really had no choice at all. You were fated to choose the chocolate malt.But suppose we do possess free will. If that is the case, then we are irrational, anarchical creatures because we choose without regard to causal reason of any sort. Our behavior becomes random and pointless. Now while I agree that much, perhaps most human behavior is bizarre, I cannot say that most of it happens without recourse to some sort of reason. Rather, it is the reason itself that is bizarre.

            “The determinists would say this is an illusion. You think you made a choice, but in reality, at a perhaps primordial psychological level, you really had no choice at all. You were fated to choose the chocolate malt.”
This is the irritating part of having anything to do with determinists of any flavor. It’s all just circular reference. Anything you say in response, anything at all, the reply is that the conditions in the universe at that point in time made you say that. It’s just a religion, but one they don’t even realize they follow.

                Intuitively, I agree with you. Necessity does seem reductive. However, beyond that lone, relatively superficial critique, it is difficult to blow holes in their overarching argument.

        The freewill debate is unsolvable in theory. If we are predetermined to do what we do, then we can never detect that we are forced into all our actions.
However, if we allow for any freewill, then we must acknowledge that incentives affect behavior. As we can see in blue cities, if you don’t punish stealing, then stealing will destroy your businesses. I used to live in Portland, Seattle, and San Fran!
Those f@ggots in those blue cities refuse to enforce consequences.
What I can’t forgive are the white liberals who refuse to punish antisocial behaviors because non-whites are sacred beings.

        I’m a midwit with these types of philosophical questions, but Tim Kelly on Our Interesting Times sometimes talks about free will and the modern “do what thou wilt” ethos in relation to our bodies. The first time I realized this was when I was in my mid 20s and someone showed me a video that plays sounds at different tones with an age listed for each tone. We stop being able to hear certain tones as we age. It’s crazy how accurate it is. Of course I didn’t choose to stop hearing that “age 25” tone when I was 26. The choice was made for me because I have a body that will do what it does and I am to some extent a subject of it.Of course this is perhaps one of the most innocuous examples. Women are on a timeline when it comes to childbirth. Despite modern science trying to defeat this, the timeline is still winning. Their lives are subject to this force. Another example of this is how men can choose to engage in homosexual behavior but it causes very real harms to the body. There is nothing anyone can do to change this fundamental reality, despite science working hard to do so. Their mental, physical, and spiritual health is affected by this reality, no matter who tells them “do what thou wilt.”The only way free will makes any sense is in the context of the idea that you are free to choose the Good. Any other path and you are headed down a road that will do you harm.

                Yes, we are pre-programmed by 100,000 years of human evolution and a few million years of biological evolution before that.  We are basically cave men thrust into modernity which we are not “programmed” to deal with.  Ever wonder why we have panic attacks?

            You raise an important point. I remember perhaps from my literature studies that the “need” for free will was crucial for Catholicism. It’s not really fair for God to punish The Sinner for choosing to sin if he doesn’t have free will to make a choice between Good and Evil.

                The same argument holds for criminal justice. Hence, if we have no free will, how can the criminal be held accountable for his crimes? And in this respect, there is a sharp divide between the Left and Right. The Leftist, seeking to exculpate his dusky constituent, will make every effort to show that white supremacy made him do it, and therefore punishing him is itself a crime. If anybody should be punished, it is whitey. The Rightist, OTOH, will argue in favor of free will in order to justify punishment.Ultimately, however, the matter of necessity v. intentionality is largely irrelevant to criminal justice. Ergo, we need not punish the criminal because he is guilty in the moral sense. Instead, we punish him because he is guilty (pernicious) to society in a practical sense. Perhaps Ty’Quayvius’ really had no choice in the matter of raping and murdering 9-year-old Suzie. But who cares? He is a monster and must be destroyed for the good of society.

                    I tend to agree. To rehash the argument I make elsewhere today (that free will is not all or nothing, but that there are degrees of agency), this occurs to me:Consider at one extreme, a being that has no free will. We’d probably call him an animal. For argument, let’s pretend a monkey who steals a piece of fruit. Surely no one would say that the monkey has sinned, or that he is morally culpable for stealing fruit that didn’t belong to him. It’s worth pointing out for this example that the monkey is, genetically speaking, a primate, a very close relative toHomo sapiens.You can probably see where I’m going with this: At the other extreme choose whomever you like as your most morally upright man. He truly knows right from wrong. In this instance he “knows” it’s “wrong” to steal the fruit, so he doesn’t.Now surely in between these two extremes there is a continuum of propensity to theft and I would claim, of degree of free will.I think Nietzsche is correct: Free will is an illusion, that man like all beasts is ruled by instinctual drives, etc. Of course that doesn’t mean that man is incapable of “rational” or “civilized” conduct, but a sober reflection upon his history, and especially that of his cousins and ancestors, would seem to indicate that “moral” behavior is very much the exception and not the rule.It also seems that monkey could be trained tonotsteal fruit; might that not be called rudimentary moral teaching? Yet a psychologist would term it conditioning. The animal has not learnt some great moral teaching (“Thus salt not steal.”); he has learned a conditioned response to stimuli. Is man’s case really any different?

        “There are other tricks like this that reveal AI to be nothing more than a very good search engine.”Probably nearer to the mark than most other (outlandish) claims currently made for AI. I’ve reference some early experimentation by Ron Unz at his blog in this matter. However, something seems missing. I’ve been using ChatGPT of late—not just as a smart search agent—that it is—but also as a consultant, a medical consultant.ChatGPT has a memory, for good or bad. This means that previous conversations (inquiries) are not forgotten, but rather become the new starting point for elaboration on previous topics researched. In short, it simulates “knowing” me. Although not overly “friendly”, ChatGPT uses these previous conversations as references and a sort of baseline to begin new discussions (inquiries). In that primitive sense, “it learns”. And what it learns is quite similar to my discussions with physicians. Indeed, superior to such in that ChatGPT presents the topic is greater detail than a hurried physician spending 5 minutes with you in the exam room. It can, and does, often supply citations for such responses.What I’ve found most remarkable is the similarity of ChatGPT response and treatment descriptions to what the “human” physician has ordered and yet, wrt detrimental (adverse) drug effects, has missed. From there it was a simple problem of (myself) experimentally removing the use of a recommended drug and seeing the effects of such a removal. In short, I—not the physician—is now in charge of my own fate. I find this to be of great physical and mental benefit, but that’s me, YMMV.The above of course supports my old theory stated here more than once that most all physicians are basically “technicians”, not scientists. They simply apply a “standard of care” handed down from on high—for better or worse—and move on to the next patient. If that is their level of training, knowledge, and insight, then indeed they may very well soon be replaced by AI. Now my question is, can my AI experience be replicated by the majority of the populace? It would seem the greatest tool in the hands of a fool is rendered worthless, but whose problem is that—the tool’s, or the user?

            Great points, and ChatGPT is also not limited by the beancounters in staffing- that is, you have 5-15 minutes for so many beds, regardless of whether a 90 year-old dementia patient has torn out his tubes, gotten out of bed and barfed on the floor, and is now out wandering around the hallway. Oh, and the charge nurse has already sent half the staff home, too.

        Restricted by the body and physical world, humans have limited ‘free will’.  Pure free will = madness.  A mere baby knows enough to take comfort when swaddled.Even the goofy gnostics figgered out the spirit is trapped in the body.Angels have more ‘free will’ as they are not, unless incarnate, limited by the body.‘What is meant exactly by free will is never clear, but there is always the assumption that when people have choices, they choose based on their sense of what is the morally right or wrong option’Ah ha ha ha.‘[Conservatives] lack the will and ability to force people to agree with them, but they resort to a form of pleading. It is the slave mentality…’Weaklings and pussies.  Good God look at the photos of the betas that write for Conservatism Inc.  Soft faces, pre-catastrophe faces, no sand whatsoever in them.  The men that elites and women choose for power.  Where are the men that men choose?‘The ruling class of the West assumes they can engineer the cultural conditions in such a way that people will choose the “right” options.’Been the strategy in the mass-com age.  And to large degree they’re right; after all, the institutions have been engineered and conquered.  Partly by incentivizing the populace to destroy their own civilization via pursuit of personal advantage.

                        This would be a prime question to ask in return: “Could you please cite all references to the following “joke”: “Why don’t skeletons…”Here is the response from ChatGPT:Yes, the joke is widely known and commonly cited as a classic example of wordplay. It doesn’t have a single, definitive origin but has been featured in joke books, online humor sites, and general pop culture for years. It’s more of a traditional pun rather than an original creation by any specific person.So it would seem that a bit of prodding is in order as your AI overlooked the stipulation wrt “uniqueness”. This is not uncommon, however is this a problem with the AI so much as the user? I for one would never have accepted the original answer having lifetime of experience. Others, perhaps not so much. In there lies the danger of an ignorant use of a highly powerful tool—and it is a tool, not an “Oracle”!

                                No, quite the opposite in this example. I point out that the failure is perhaps not one of the AI LLM, but *also* of the original query as not being precise enough for the AI to understand and respond to adequately.
In fact, although I don’t keep records, I estimate close to 50% of all my queries to ChatGPT must be restated to improve upon the original query response.  That is not (in my opinion) the fault of the AI implementation, but the fault of the (inexperienced) user.

                            ABM asked it to write an “original joke”. The request is succinct and unambiguous: Provide a joke which is new, fresh, the first instance of itself, and so on. Surely the model was trained on common, published definitions, in which case the request was correctly analyzed by the algo. Yet something went wrong.The problem here stems, I think, from the fact that most or all Western “AI” systems (and I admit an assumption about the perp’s origins) are programmed to shade the truth or to spit out lies. Is this not comically apt for this dying civilization? The West—the empire of lies and liars—has devised near its end a bunch of simulated intelligence systems which emulate the character flaw for which the West deserves most to be remembered for thousands of years after the extinction of its indigenous fools.

                That is my main concern. Faming audio is now possible to a degree that no one can tell the fake from real. Video is pretty close. This means the FBI will soon have new tools to frame innocent people.

                    I have some related concerns. What about the historic record? Old newspapers provide a treasure trove of knowledge and insights as to what happened in the past. There’s something about words being frozen on a piece of paper that speaks truth. Now, everything is virtual. It seems like it would be fairly easily to manipulate the historic record to say whatever you want.Then we have the usual suspects manipulating AI to give us the answers they want. Imagine AI always giving you answers that are pro-“our greatest ally,” for example. We may one day ask AI to write up something for us about the founding of the United States which then goes into long detail about how our founding fathers championed the Israeli Homeland or some such nonsense.You could say the same thing for global warming, green energy, or whatever propaganda they happen to want to push at any given time.And then there is the Terminator. What if that script wasn’t based in fiction? What if they do become self-aware, develop a defense mechanism and we have no way to shut them off? (I say this only partly in jest.)

                        “Old newspapers provide a treasure trove of knowledge and insights as to what happened in the past.”I think that would depend on how far you go back.  Anything from the post-war era is likely just a bunch of propaganda.  Though if you go back further, it does seem better.  I recently read a 19th century report in a magazine (I’m pretty sure it was The Atlantic, July 1881) about the Ladies’ Deposit Corporation, a 19th century Ponzi scheme.  It seemed to be free of propaganda.  OTOH, a lot of articles written about the Titanic sinking were full of lies.At their best, newspapers are meant to inform the general public on topics of their interests.  But they are rarely at their best and never in the modern era.  Editorializing and narratives have always been a problem with the press.

                            True, but I guess it depends on the subject matter as well. …Somewhat related: In the local paper today, the granddaughter of Paul Tibbets, the guy who flew the Enola Gay and nuked the Japs, is crying because Trump’s scrub of DEI in the Department of Defense flagged pictures of the Enola Gay and they are supposedly set for removal. Lefties just don’t get that Trump is trolling them in very large part.I’ve been trolling the lefties this morning by calling him a mass murderer, and complaining about all the harm he released on Mother Gaia not only by nuking the Japs but in his later role as CEO of the forerunner to Net Jets. Not only he helped provide an elitist luxury service to the gilded class, just think of the carbon footprint of all those private jets flying around. 😂😂😂😂😂I mentioned this because of how easy it is to change a narrative. All you need is control of the entire media echo chamber and you can turn Paul Tibbets into the new Hitler.

                            Well, I always thought part of analyzing history was putting the papers into context. If we know it is propaganda, we can process it through the lens. But I suspect that future “historians” will not even do that, they will rely on AI to do the analysis for them and spit something out. Of course, it will be what the people who wrote the AI want them to see. So, in other words, the days of historical research may be coming to an end, and we simply will not get revisionism. This is great for the regime!

                    There is no way for any actor to not have this ability now. The Regime of the West has forfeited its legitimacy for the reasons that all of us here know. This aspect of AI is going to lead to a permanent legitimacy crisis. Whose fake is real will be the constant debate? There is also the training set that a comment below points out.In any case, this is a great topic. In the end, clans with extremely deep, in-person in-real-life ties that have mechanisms to prove sincerity , loyalty, validity … … will emerge. One thing that encourages me, is that because the Regime declared us the enemy and smashed us up with the outsider, subgroups in our sphere are well down that path. There are advantages to being the first to be turned upon. At the same time, whoever controls the state will simply use all necessary force to enforce what is deemed real. Letitia James with generative AI.Would love an essay or two on this topic of AI smashing legitimacy and giving rise to vicious tyranny via generating fakes.

                        “This aspect of AI is going to lead to a permanent legitimacy crisis. Whose fake is real will be the constant debate? “This is along my thinking.  So far—and I am no expert in the AI field—it seems that AI for general use is adapting the “Wikipedia” fallacy.  That is to say, if you load enough information, from enough sources, the final outcome will be the truth!Wikipedia demonstrated the fallacy of this assumption and proved once again an even older adage: “garbage in, garbage out”. Perhaps the first axiom I learned in my first programming course 60 years ago!But again, is this an axiomatic result of the technology, or its implementation?  Should this stop Ford Motor company from rolling out an AI for use by its dealerships?

Actually, that is a better way of putting it.  My Wiki analogy really depends on or fails to acknowledge people (Wiki Editors) deliberately altering the data through various means to achieve a false narrative.  I should have more plainly stated such.  Your reference to “democracy” explicitly acknowledges the problem of falsity—it’s people.

                            Yes. This is another interesting point. AI is a handmaiden of fakery because it can imitate very well, and it will get even better.However, intelligence is a misnomer. It doesn’t even have knowledge. It is trained on massive datasets where all it is doing is predicting the next most likely word in a sequence over and over and over again. For factual information this works well. Use LLMs to summarize factual information or imitate some legal document that is fixed in format and it is really quite good. It can even paraphrase quite well. However, if the information it has synthesized in its next-most-likely-word neurons is false, it will regurgitate false information.This is exactly the model of Wikipedia. Those pages are highly editorialized and grow increasingly so. In fact, Wikipedia is a major source of LLM training data. Some in the dissident sphere and tech have stated that it is essential that we train our own models not on Wikipedia. In fact, one of Bidens big womyn in misinformation labeling was the overbutch of Wikipedia until she was dismissed. She oversaw the use of AI to generate Wikis and vice versa.This still always comes down to who says. Then there are the directives and selective editing of training data that go even further. The instances of Gemini’s total White erasure were programmed into the model and so it created a world where White people had never existed. That was willful and everyone at Google with a hand in that should be tried for cultural genocide because that is what that is. Our eradication from history was programmed/trained into the model.In any case, yes. LLMs are really just sophisticated information regurgitation machines. The ones that will be reliable will be the ones that places like Palantir use to synthesize battlefield information and allow non-programmers to reprogram equipment or suggest tactics … This is because they will be useful only if they are trained accurately.Garden variety document review lawyering can go the way of the dodo. Even though, the “Trust and Safety Committee”, makes handing this over to machines suspect and dangerous. Call centers can go the way of the dodo – at least the ones where pajeets and flips just read from a script and basically sound like an etiquette machine without any agency and knowledge. An AI agent can easily replace that and even have sophisticated agents route workflows and solve problems that those glorified answering services can’t.How this plays out will be interesting. Human trust networks will become more important than they ever have in all of human history as a result of this.

                    someone says “deepfake”, I hear “reasonable doubt.” I don’t see how the FBI could ever get a conviction when the other person could just say any audio/video evidence against them was faked. Wires and tapped phones are basically completely useless at that point.

                        “don’t see how the FBI could ever get a conviction when the other person could just say any audio/video evidence against them was faked.”This is a problem, but unfortunately not a legal issue.  It’s one of law and its current counterpart is typical “chain of evidence” challenges.  The FBI will take the stand and testify how the audio/video was collected, then transferred from there all the way to the court.  If necessary, a dozen witnesses will testify how they “handled” the evidence such that it was not tampered with. Seen this on a Grand Jury myself.The defense of course will challenge, but if the chain remains unbroken, the evidence is considered valid.  The courts can work no other way.  I even doubt if the chain of custody is not shown to be broken that the deep fake technology possibility will even be allowed to be brought up by the defense. No Strawmen allowed.

                            They put wiretaps in lawyer’s offices.  40 years ago, everyone agreed a lawyer’s office was sacred.  But they did it with Joey Merlino (IIRC, it was definitely an alleged mobster). You pretty much have no rights.The chain of evidence thing is a formality. Even if the court took the objections seriously, they would flip the burden and make you prove you didn’t say anything on the tapes. It will be a whole new category of 10k Dollar a day “experts” certified to testify in court that no signitures of any known AI or that definite signatures of AI could be found, depending on which side they are on.In reality, generally speaking, the cops employ these “Experts,” so they cost the state nothing, but if you really didn’t say it, you have to pay the “Expert” for his “Expert testimony” Many of these “Experts” for hire are double dipping academics getting paid both by their university and for the time on the case. Just one big grift.

            LLM is well known for making stuff up. I don’t see how anyone can trust it. Even when it doesn’t make stuff up, it’s like a hypercharged version of Wikipedia, and Wikipedia is basically a CIA front. Google also spent a lot of money for access to Reddit, and Reddit is designed to produce a top-down social consensus (I think it’s a CIA front too). Put two and two together, our social engineers are training people to rely on whatever the LLM vomits out, and then they train the LLM to produce whatever they want people to believe. The LLM creates the reality of the regime before it spits it out to the person asking the questions.

                One of Reddit’s greatest sins was its role in establishing the ranked upvote as a standard for internet forums. On paper it makes sense, but in practice it sucks. Every thread becomes a race to be the first poster and/or the terminally online kook with handle recognition, and then the discussion gets pulled by whoever gets the first upvote traction.Makes it very easy to manipulate for botfarms. I was shocked that there are people who make a living creating Reddit accounts and seasoning them to get past moderators before I knew about the prevalence of botfarms, but it makes perfect sense in that context.We’ve even seen it here since Zman implemented the update system. Almost every day, half the comments on the thread will be attached to whatever the first non-retarded comment to get posted, because people want their comment to be seen. It’s just human nature.Updoots to the left fellow Zedditors. Please donate to my gofundme to save my hecking pupperino!

Yep. Regardless of the topic, a common theme to that dominant post here usually manifests by 10 or 11, Eastern Time.
Anyone notice what it is?

        With regard to free will, I would be more skeptical of the idea if individual people reacted to stimuli more consistently.  Groups are way more predictable than single people.  Groups will naturally default to the mean, like any statistically normal population.   But on any given day I might alter some reactions, often even against my self interest, simply due to spite.  There have been moments I was so annoyed over a petty disappointment in a matter of taste that I chose to take nothing rather than enjoy something perfectly adequate.Of course all animals have pre-programmed survival algorithms, as we would die off without them.  The smartest is not smart enough to think through everything in real time and function efficiently.  Those algos are largely common to our particular sub-species, since our needs are mostly identical.  Therefore, to a large extent, we will seem like automatons.  But this is because, luckily, most daily decisions aren’t hard or consequential.  Just leave it to the algo, and daydream about something more interesting.  And those dreams are were its easiest to see the individual.

There’s no way to check.Number is not descriptive. Counting is an imposition of extraneous qualities on what’s counted. Nerds, psychopaths, and monsters regard those qualities—calculability, convertibility, etc.—as real.
Maybe they are. Probably not. They appear wherever they’reput.

        Well it may not be an issue at all soon. I keep hearing about those 1000 qubit quantum computers… and it’s scaring the shite out of the tall foreheads. Apparently the thing is messing about in alternative time lines, and/or reversing the flow of time in ours, and/or messing about with our own reality.
I wonder what a temporal unreality bomb would look like? And given the antics and monkey business in Ottawa and Washington… how’d you know one went off?

        When the muslims take over, what will become of the AI? I can sort of picture what a muslim dominated AI would look like, hypothetically, assuming they possessed the skill to program it and control it. But I don’t think it’s a given that they do. We could end up seeing a muslim dominated Europe still running on the baizuo white man’s AI. That seems like the most likely scenario. In which the new muslim masters need the AI in order to make basic services function, but the AI is still saying that best practices suggest giving your child puberty blockers at age 2 and things of that nature. Perhaps the Chinese could supply them with a more coherent AI with which they can replace whitey’s AI. But why would the Chinese care whether or not New Europe’s AI made sense or functioned well?

            There are some excellent scientists, computer scientists, engineers … … from the muslim world. They will be able to program and develop AI, just as they are doing with battlefield drones and technology.It is a cope to think we will be taken over by incompetents. No. We will be taken over period. This is why legal immigration and schemes like the Gold Card are existential threats to our future. The danger is not to be ruled by dumb asses, but to be ruled by aliens who can be competent or who can control a satrapy well enough. A good example is the billionaire who controls Haiti. He rules over ashes and what does he care. Btw, that is another case of EST.

            Inasmuch as the Islamic viewpoint is closer in most ways to reality, I would expect it to fare better at solving real world problems than the White Baizuo version. The same thing is probably true of a Christian fundamentalist one. You might get some weird answers if you asked it to interpret the geology of the Grand Canyon but, like the Islamic one, it would have no trouble telling you not to give your kid puberty blockers. I’ve speculated that a dissident AI would offer a definite advantage to its users that would be worth paying for. Corporations will happily force their “drone” employees to use one of the mainstream pozzed and woke AIs. They might want their executives using the dissident one though, even if the company publicly promotes woke garbage.

        I believe the reason AI makes many people uncomfortable is not so much that it suggests human beings are predictable, but rather that we are not special. It is either a truism or a conceit that human beings are uniquely intelligent, with creativity enfolded in intelligence. But if a machine can be both intelligent and creative, where does that leave mankind?What is the difference between a moist robot and a cognitive machine? AI transgresses mightily against our very conception of humanness.

        What needs to be considered: even if there was no free will, that does not mean that human action would be predictable.

Think about the stock market: all players claim to act rationally, yet nobody can predict anything.

This is because it is a self-referential, chaotic system, where small changes in parameters can lead to wild swings in outcomes. Therefore, the only way to say how the system will behave is to live through it…

Under this light, I’m not even sure if it is worth it pondering that question!

        Re the potential for what they gratuitously call AI, I see it being most effective as an advanced stat cruncher, dealing with concrete factual data.  The effectiveness of the algo that can interpret x-ray results is an impressive example.  It is not thinking, but it seems that way because it can do math so complex that the human brain would take multiple lifetimes of dedicated work to do the same.  Sadly, in making this comparison, we forget the astounding amount of computational work, using who-knows-how-many advanced algos, across multiple dissimilar finctional modes, our brain is doing every moment.But, it isn’t ‘thinking’ and I see no reason to believe it ever will, since we still (so far as I’ve read up to this point) don’t really know what cognition actually is.  How can you mathematically model what you can’t properly define?

            Computation is certainly part of intelligence, but only part. If AI’s abilities are limited to computation, then to even call it AI is a fallacy. However, I understand AI also has the ability to create. And if a machine can both compute and create then you are truly approaching genuine intelligence, IMO. But then there’s the matter of consciousness. And to truly think, consciousness is a prerequisite. But then what is consciousness? Could consciousness be a function of cognition? Vice versa?

        “The good news is that AI is not very smart and is unlikely to become a genuine artificial intelligence”I don’t know about that. I know I’m not very smart. When I pay a neural network chess engine, I have no way of beating it. No human chess player does. So what is “very smart?” We’re probably pretty close to an “artificial general intelligence”, which can learn by itself in the same manner that a neural network can learn Go and chess by itself in a matter of hours. I think we need a clearer definition of what “very smart” means, both among humans, and compared to the evolving neural networks that are now being created with troubling speed.

            What is intelligence? And what role, if any, does consciousness play in intelligence? There are no certain answers to those questions. And until there are, we’re taking a crap in the wind on the matter of whether or not AI is truly intelligent let alone “very” intelligent.

        I can sit in my chair all day or I can go out for a long walk. Hmmm … that appears to indicate a choice. But it is not so. If I sit in the chair all day it is because something has prevented me from going out. And vice versa. Things we do or do not are a result of a conflicting force we know nothing about.

        Explaining to people why something is right and should be public policy is reasonable, since most people have a sense of right and wrong and can be appealed to on that basis. It is also reasonable to explain that, since such-and-such a policy is right, we’re going to do it whether you like it or not. Who says A, must say B.

        Nietzsche is unequivocally anti-free will. He says it can be disproved but to the best of my knowledge he provides no such proof. In many other passages he argues that man is dominated by primitive instincts the unconscious etc. For example that a criminal should not be considered “guilty” of a crime, because that presumes that he could have chosen to do right or wrong, but that may not be the case.Perhaps a middle position is closer to the real situation.  One of several identified errors of philosophers is the insistence on antithesis of values. Some might argue either Free Will exist or it does not. Ah, but is it really that simple? Who says it must be all or nothing? Unless I misread Z this morning he even implicitly agrees as much. We are free to choose in some situations, forced to choose in others and perhaps if we refuse to choose a default will be selected for us even if that choice is “none of the above”.Even that common chocolate versus vanilla example has a lot of implicit assumptions. We need to know that a choice is even available. We need to know what those choices are, chocolate and vanilla. Is there an option to refuse to choose? If we do not make a choice will a choice be forced upon us? And finally it’s worth mentioning that we don’t have the power to choose to add strawberry or other flavors to that menu. That last power is reserved to a higher power. That humans lack the power to be God has never stopped them from saying “Thou shalt” apparently expecting reality to reconfigure itself to their wishes.

            Nietzsche’s position makes sense: there’s the illusion of choice but we’re programmed to make certain choices or at least to heavily prefer certain choices.
