        It would come as quite a surprise to the media and London based elite if they could hear how most of us average Brits view islam, there is no tolerance at all and eventually the govt will not be able to keep a lid on it.

        I think that most of the timescales for a potential Muslim takeover are too conservative.  The tipping point isn’t when the Muslims reach population parity or are large enough a bloc to form an “Islamic Democrat” party.  It’s when the the number of Muslim 18 year olds is greater than or equal to the number of native 18 year olds.  45 year olds don’t have very long half life in street battles.  One could make the case that the 50% point is too conservative as well given how we and the rest of the West have pansified our young men.  The high school band and debate club aren’t going to do too well in urban warfare either.

        As I am an unhappy observer (though hopefully one who is wise enough to avoid the baleful glare of the Queen’s Loyal Authorities who think me not liking the incoming hordes is a mark of my disrespect for their allegedly superior ways) of Islam I am not sure your evaluation here is right.Of course Islam is ‘on the rise.’ Many of them breed furiously (helpfully paid for by the state they hate) and once in it you can never leave. You have doubts, oh bearded one? Tough, you are born to the faith and must stay ‘faithful’ come what may. Anyway, your cousins will be arriving soon to swell the numbers.Of course Christinity is on the decline; if you have freedom of choice you probably can think of better ways to spend a Sunday.I went to a local (Christian) church service the other week. It was okay in its own way but the hymns were dire and the ‘message’ a little at odds with what I believe. I will go back one day — probably — but not any time soon. I suspect that puts me more in the ‘don’t know, don’t care’ category. In fact the appearance of my wife and I at the church may have helped lift the attendance figures but us not going on more Sundays will have brought the average down.But figures have always been fabulous things to play around with and whether you get to the truth depends on how you add them up.

        The Church of England, like the British monarchy, is a ceremonial institution, reflecting some lost past. And even in it’s distant past it was never inspirational. It represented and reflected the state, and still does even more so, which is why nobody goes.

            Religion in England has always been a little weird compared to the Continent. Into the 8th century, monasteries were lascivious places. It was where the nobility stored their extra kids. Long before Henry the Head Chopper, there was great tension between the English Bishops and the English nobility. Then English have always been a bit indifferent to religion relative to other populations of Europe.The issue facing England is the growing power of Islam in the coming decades. Once the Muslims reach a critical mass, they will organize politically into their own party. If you are not even allowed to mention any of this in public, how in the world are the English going to fend off their demands. Either England goes Muslim by the 2050’s or they evict their Muslims.

        It’s more than strong- vs weak-horse. The character of the people has changed. They are overly deferential to their rulers, eager to learn how to behave and what to think from movie stars and to be guided by politicians. They no longer wish to make their own decisions, and desire only that others supply peace of mind.
Islam means submission. In their hearts they have submitted. Christianity means salvation. They know longer know “from what.”

        London is already mockingly called Londonistan across Europe, it’s pretty bad.
Although technically Islam could be banned for the same reason the Nazi Party is banned in Germany, as it also endangers the basic free order of society, and currently even more so!
I was just in a museum recently and they had walls, no, whole halls full of weapons taken from Ottoman invaders. We threw them back once, we can do it again! Or we can give those weapons from the museum directly back as a party-gift and bend over…
