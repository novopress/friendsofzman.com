        There is truth to that. When you see pubic mugshots with the a-symmetrical, glazed faces, you know you’re not dealing with the brightest lot

        I totally agree with your assessment. And yes, people that write this sort of nonsense do not socialize with poor people.I was supposed to go to college and move into the the middle class. Didn’t seem very interesting, so I went the poor route. I did a lot of factory jobs, which I still prefer to office work. (You have a lot more time to think doing farm work!) There’s a related article by Sarah Hoyt this week, on how the poor used to reinforce “decent” behaviour, like getting married when the girl gets pregnant and taking care of your family. It’s too bad that these pretentious liberals convinced people to do away with all of that.
