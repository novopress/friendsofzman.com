        When a man like John Derbyshire becomes too controversial for The Bastion of Conservatism Yclept National Review, you know it‚Äôs an empty publication with nothing left worth saying.

                    Yes, the purging of Mark Steyn from NR was genuinely astonishing. Firing one of the few decent writers that they had left for, not even really opposing gay marriage, but for speaking less than reverently about it, at an allegedly ‚ÄúChristian, Conservative‚Äù magazine was when Conservatism, Inc. Jumped the Shark.

        Found a cache of old Life magazines from the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs last weekend.  No wonder the magazine went away.  Pages upon pages of breathless blather about the minutiae of the Democrat election strategies and people in the ‚Äò68 (Humphrey) and ‚Äò72 (McGovern) campaigns.  Nixon may as well have been a ghost or nonexistent, as far as Life was concerned.  Carefully calibrated slightly laudatory comments on the likes of Angela Davis.  Midwesterners consistently treated like alien beings living on another planet.  Pollution about to destroy the Earth in a matter of months or a few years‚Äîthat is what had the young‚Äôns shook up in ‚Äò72, according to the mag.  Overall, American life was described as a malaise, the American Experiment was an awful thing, the Republicans were the devil, and the world was about to end.All of the stuff we see today is old, old, old.  Just the players have changed.  Near as I can tell, the political players back then were  just as bad as they are today, but with a tighter press cocoon  to protect them.  The faster we burn down the (really) old media, the better.

            ‚ÄúLife‚Äù and ‚ÄúLook‚Äù magazines were some of the first media to tank because they got too out of touch with their base demographic. My parents were they type of people who subscribed to those magazines; FDR-Truman Democrats, deeply opposed to both Communism and Nazism, moderate liberals but also somewhat race-realist in practice. In the late sixties, the media went full New Left, and lost people like them. My mom ended up a full-on Reagan supporter, while my father may have even voted for Nixon in ‚Äô72. It was a sign of the times, as we said back then.

                I picked up a copy of ‚ÄúThe Week‚Äù in my opticians office on Wednesday:(11 AM on the day before thanksgiving is a great no-wait time.)
The Week looks like National Review for none-geriatrics- All ultimately funded by the Kochs and their ilk.
The Angel of Death will get them at some point.

        Slightly tangential, but germane enough: For those who aren‚Äôt aware, in the UK, Piers Morgan has long been commonly referred to as Piers Moron. üòÄ
Private Eye magazine invented the sobriquet, I believe, but that‚Äôs how most people now refer to that puffy-faced chancer.
I‚Äôm just sorry that he was ever foisted on the American public.

            I remember watching his show a couple of time, his way of thinking was so foreign to me I wondered if I was watching inter-dimensional cable or something.
The only positive  thing I will say about Piers Morgan  is his willingness to treat President Trump with respect and a bit of loyalty even at a social cost.

        The was a time when leadership in any venue was earned via deeds, and followers could not easily be hoodwinked because the value was obvious to the eye. We now live in a world in which words largely substitute for deeds and we are forever being duped by charlatans. I do not know this Shapiro poser, but I ask . . . what has he done?

            Vox Day had his number way back in 2001-2003.  Shapiro (via nepotism) got an opinion column World Net Daily when he was in high school.  He banged the drums to invade Iraq.  VD and others asked, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you enlist?‚Äù  Shapiro demurred and let the goyim bear that burden while he went to college and law school.
And thus was born ‚ÄúThe Littlest Chickenhawk.‚Äù

        I‚Äôve always hated Shapiro. A shill for the Iraq war but somehow could not be bothered to sign up for a tour of duty. Vox Day has challenged him a time or two to a debate but somehow ((Ben)) can‚Äôt be bothered. Shapiro is an armchair warrior who makes bank writing worthless drivel.

        George Will had to finally leave the Republican party to keep his seat.Remember way way back when Joe Sobran had a nationally syndicated column? He touched that rail with the JQ on it and was gulaged. That was the lesson for the rest of the kept conservatives. They all know how to navigate and sound controversial or bold when they are neither.
God, I‚Äôm old enough to remember Agronsky and company. They had James Kilpatrick as the token then. It is better now by a long shot.

        Shapiro is nothing, he‚Äôs just a professional speaker and writer. He‚Äôll say whatever you pay him to say. He could just as easily go lite-lib as he goes lite-con, if you wave enough shekels in front of him. He‚Äôs the pol pundit equivalent of easy listening music or lite rock 107.5

        The problem the lefties and proggies have is that they are inherently self defeating. When they take over an organization they typically run it into the ground, and they take their house negroes with them when they go.The mainstream media‚Äôs a dead man walking. If you moderate your platform to suit the homosexuals, Marxists, feminists and other degenerates ‚Äì they are the only ones that will use it or patronize it. Consider the last election when all you deplorable racists, gun nuts, religious zealots and miscellaneous cretins ‚Äì refused to vote the way the Cloud People told you to. Many of you unwashed swine even made political mileage on giving your intellectual and moral superiors in the media ‚Äì an upraised middle finger. Did you know that ‚Äòinappropriate laughter‚Äô is a hate crime too? All your hateful laughter is deafening when Trump goes on Twitter to troll the the Clod‚Ä¶errrr‚Ä¶‚ÄôCloud‚Äô People. Newspapers can‚Äôt sell a paper or a subscription to save their lives, and rollbacks and cutbacks are getting deeper all the time industry wide. Looks good on ‚Äôem if you ask me.You are absolutely right about this being a generational divide too. My elderly boomer parents are furious and horrified when I laugh at their day time TV heroes like Dr. Phil and Orca Winfrey, and the clucky harridans of The View. It‚Äôs tough for me because I have to accept one of two distasteful scenarios: either my parents are idiots ‚Äì or they‚Äôve gone off the deep end and are old and stupid the way seniors can get to be. Three weeks ago my own mother called me a fascist ‚Äì which are fighting words for me. I told her I wasn‚Äôt impressed with her either, or her (and I quote myself verbatim) ‚Äòfemcnut/chitlib politics‚Äô. The old bird melted down and I haven‚Äôt heard from her since ‚Äì and I am not going to apologize to her either. Mine is not the only family where this stuff is becoming personal.Ben Shipero does not speak for me as a conservative, nor does Jonah Goldberg or Dave Fwench or any of the other leftist house negroes. If the media wants to be taken seriously they need to confront the real political right in honest and forthright debate.

            Glen, that sucks.  I no longer argue with liberals I otherwise like, because it‚Äôs so frustrating to have them acknowledge the logic of my position, but adamantly not allow it to alter their view.  Two of my favorite quotes:  1) ‚ÄúNever try to teach a pig to sing.  It‚Äôs a waste of time and it annoys the pig.‚Äù  2) ‚ÄúIt is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into.‚Äù

            Old people sit in front of the TV too much. It rots what‚Äôs left of  their brains and destroys any ability they ever had to distinguish reality from the fiction being pumped into their heads.My elderly former civil rights activist mother watches Rachel Maddow avidly, and is troubled by the fact that I possess more than one firearm. I quit trying to talk to her about politics years ago.But it‚Äôs not just her. All my friends from college and my youth are the same way. I joined Facebook just to hook up with some of them a while back, only to find that they‚Äôre still saccharine lefties and now reinvigorated enthusiatic Trump bashers. I‚Äôm on the verge of just nuking the account at this point, since the entire feed is nothing but shitlib agitation and apology.It is a generational divide, but it‚Äôs also a cognitive divide.Most people do not think. Maybe more people did in the past, but one thing that‚Äôs struck me in the last few decades is how many people now preface their obserations about politics, or anything really, with ‚ÄúI feel that..‚Äù.  You even see this with politicians and pundits on the idiot box.I think this is an intentional result brought about by the lefties in the schools. I‚Äôm convinced that they indoctrinate kids to refer first, and primarily, to their feeeeeelings, as Michael Savage would say, rather than come up with some chain of plausible evidence to infer what they would then state as their thoughts.I may be recalling a rosy past that never existed, but it seems like  it wasn‚Äôt that long ago when ‚ÄúI think‚Äù would have been the favored way of introducing one‚Äôs opinion.That said, some boomers are realistic and empirical enough to see reality well into late middle age. Most can‚Äôt. I find I have much more in common politically speaking with ‚Äúthe kids‚Äù than with anyone of my own generation. Of course, it helps that I reeducated myself by moving deep into red state territory.As for Shapiro, I‚Äôve never been able to listen to more than 10 words out of his mouth without closing the tab on my browser.He always looks and sounds to me like the completely insincere president of a college fraternity doing a little PR to drum up support for the chapter‚Äôs annual muscular dystrophy fundraiser

                Ever watch the movie ‚ÄúThey Live‚Äù?TV has always been a very poor information medium and more of a entertainment medium.  Smart people avoid watching lots of TV, only poor people on the dole watch a lot of it. See Neil Postman‚Äôs ‚ÄúEntertaining ourselves to death‚ÄùThough addiction to Social Media is replacing TV viewing among younger peeps. it‚Äôs far more addictive that TV ever could be due to it‚Äôs interactive nature.In general most people don‚Äôt think because they were never taught to be active learners and thinkers. Our schools are fine for churning out obedient drones for Herman-Miller cube farms and ‚Äúdo you want fries with that‚Äù type of jobs.  Jobs which don‚Äôt require thinking and just being there for the most part.You don‚Äôt see public schools teaching the basics of Socratic logic or S.I. Hayakawa‚Äôs ‚ÄúLanguage in thought and Action‚Äù how language is used as a propaganda tool to manipulate people.  Or a lot of other topics that get neglected. because they were not intended to be included  to begin with.You see our system was never meant to produce citizens in the Athenian sense. Just consumers and worker bees.

        Think what you will of Ben Shapiro or Milo Yiannopoulos or Ann Coulter and the very, very few others like them, but the fact remains that these three are just about the only conservatives that ever get onto a TV screen outside of a Fox TV channel AND can actually make plain and clear their version of a conservative agenda.For whatever reasons, liberal progs have no problems elucidating their policies (and excoriating those of their opposition) that even poorly educated college kids and inner city blacks will give them their vote. Of course, the liberal progs are always welcome and/or promoted all over TV and other mass media.Contrast this to the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù of your typical dumb-publican (e.g.,Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, any Bush, Romney, Boehner, etc. ) that you hear.Don‚Äôt know about anyone else, but I still have not figured out what the F*ck their message is. These guys literally must have a speech impediment of sorts or are just total morons; they are incapable or explaining anything at all; they are simply inept, and incompetent.Even the Alzheimer‚Äôs suffering, besotted Nancy Pelosi can get her point across with greater ease than any republican.Progs know how to reach the masses on an emotional level and are effective in assigning the neo-Nazi, fascist label onto anyone they oppose.The dumb-publicans can‚Äôt even pull off their knickers before they defecate.So, kudos to Shapiro and the very few like him; if not for them, there would be nobody at all on (ex-Fox) TV attempting to counter the liberal progressive, hate America first agenda.

                Yep. I read Shapiro when he was on BB. He was very careful on not talking about certain issues like trade, globalization and open borders, importing foreign workers, etc. Basically all the stuff that people care about.
He finally got the boot after he openly sided with Cruz and that female extortionist. It showed people a unethical POS he is.

But he sure gets the ANTIFA, BLM. LGBT and other assorted libs/media/academic/commie groups all lathered up just by showing up.If he was a phony, why would they get all out of sorts when he speaks ?

                    I find Shapiro as annoying as 115 decibels of fingernails on a chalkboard.  But Tyler is right, he‚Äôs willing to get behind enemy lines and stir things up.  And he is good on his feet. Spoke at one of my kids‚Äô schools last spring.  SJWs were so lathered up you couldn‚Äôt even ‚Äúlike‚Äù the event page on FB to get ticket updates since they would hunt you down for harassment.  Got the blow by blow of the lead up from my son, the SJWs were like a sack of rabid cats over the fact that the university president grew a pair and was going to let him speak.  He managed to get a ticket (and I watched about half of the livestream) To Shapiro‚Äôs credit he gave ample time to the SJWs to ask questions.  For the most part he just let them walk into a ‚ÄúL‚Äù ambush and annihilated them.  It was hilarious.  House negro or not, that‚Äôs a positive in my book.

        ‚ÄúThe first time I had any reason to know about Ben Shapiro was when he appeared on the Piers Morgan show to talk guns. ‚ÄùI never heard of him before 2016 election Twitter and even then it was mostly because he was being raked over the coals by the accounts I was following for being NeverTrump.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where a guy like Ben Shapiro is seen as the millennial Bill Safire.‚ÄùI barely paid attention to Safire back in the day and Shapiro is pretty much off the radar for me completely but I‚Äôm not the audience. He‚Äôs being geared to be right of center left background noise for the general public and a respectable outlet for those trying to work their way into the elite but aren‚Äôt comfortable with the current progressive agenda of tranny kindergartens and mosques on every corner. Even with more choices than three networks these days, he‚Äôll probably make a good living from it.‚ÄúThe bigger issue though is the rise of alternative media.‚ÄùThe young are definitely more online but I think that a lot of people overestimate social media (basically Twitter) and underestimate TV. The online sources have replaced newspapers mostly but most people will still tune into the local news on TV if they want to watch it. TV is still everywhere. When something big happens, most people will still turn on the TV to take a look.And on top of that political junkies who do go to get news are split ‚Äì a lot of those youth going online for news aren‚Äôt going to right wing sites. Plus I‚Äôd guess that the whole of the political world online is dwarfed by stuff normal people prefer. I don‚Äôt have numbers but I‚Äôd guess that the whole of the online political sphere, both left and right, are probably dwarfed by celebrity news.

            In the 80‚Äôs, I had coevals who were really into the music of the 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs. They embraced the radical politics of the New Left. It was a form of apple polishing. Our Boomer teachers loved it. It was validating. The rest of us just though the suck-ups were pussies, because they were pussies.
I suspect some of that with guys like Shapiro. The Boomer Cons want to believe their ideas are timeless and nothing validates that like seeing their kid‚Äôs ape their styles. That‚Äôs why he can go on campus and get treated like a star.

                I‚Äôd like to know on just what fucking campus Ben Shapiro is treated like a rock star.  I‚Äôve done tours of duty at State U and Directional Tech, and trust me, the College Republicans don‚Äôt have a deep enough roster to have a pickup basketball game.  Throw in the College Libertarians and you‚Äôve got maybe three more Cheeto-stained asthmatics.  He‚Äôs paid to book a gig at Berkeley, which then gets shut down for security concerns, at which point his bosses say ‚Äúsee? Told ya!‚Äù and get to pretend they‚Äôve still got it.

                I agree with what you‚Äôre saying, Z Man, but to be fair, the rock music that came out of 1970‚Äôs America is something the world has never had anything like before and never will again. Unique and ass-kicking wonderful. Before music was taken over by bean-counters packaging boy bands.

        Key tactical question: Even if BenShapiro is an idiot, is he useful_?
I‚Äôd have to say that he‚Äôs taken some hits for the team, even if he‚Äôs dislikable personally.  On the latter I‚Äôm agnostic.  Not a few of us here have their moments.  Maybe even me üòâ

            Some people make the argument that Shapiro opens the door to the Right. Maybe. My sense is he is more of a life boat for those who just can‚Äôt cross the river to our side. I have a buddy who is my age and loves Shapiro. He knows I‚Äôm right about the world, but he really, really wants Shapiro to be right, so he clings to the ‚Äúideology uber alles‚Äù dingy, hoping it reaches shore.

                At least Shapiro‚Äôs tides are slightly to the Right .
maybe your friend will get it together enough to get off that leaky raft and get onto a real ship. The crew of the .Alt Right is a bit cantankerous but she‚Äôs a fine ship who‚Äôll get you where you need to be.

                Shapiro‚Äôs standard college-talk spiel included a bit about the Putnam study and how racial diversity destroys social capital, from which the Dissident Right is a mere stone‚Äôs throw away. It‚Äôs part of why I‚Äôm here now, for example. Having made the shift I only go to Shapiro for legal analysis.
It could be an age thing. People who (want to) think they know how things work probably will let slide Shapiro‚Äôs refusal to address obvious questions in order to protect their opinions, whereas younger guys like myself see that evasion as an enticement.

        As usual, Occamberg‚Äôs Razor explains why Ben Shapiro is being pushed onto us as the Next Big Conservative Thing. He is Jewish, and so is the media pushing him. Why do Jews do something? Because it benefits the Jews.How? Easy. Ben Shapiro, like George Will before him, is just the right slice of bread of the Kosher Sandwich.That slice is provided for the goyim who won‚Äôt swallow the Left Liberal Jewish cultural &amp; moral programming coming out of the universities &amp; media.These Right Wing Jews give the goyim a way to oppose leftism while:1) Never EVER thinking of white people as a group who deserves to advance their own interests.2) Never EVER questioning supporting Israel.3) Never EVER noticing the extraordinary influence of Jews in our nation‚Äôs hateful &amp; parasitic elite.

                You are right. George Will is an Israel supporting atheist married to a neocon Jew, but not technically Jewish himself.Sub in William Safire then. The point remains.The Jewish run media pushes forward these ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù conservatives to channel anger away from noticing inconvenient patterns about Jewish influence.

        The best comparison I can think of is boxing. Don King rarely outright rigged fights. Usually, he would spend months hyping just the right opponent for his champ to beat. Sometimes the challenger had the self-awareness to get it. Other times they bought into their own false hype. I see the NY Times doing that now. Ben Shapiro buys the false hype.
