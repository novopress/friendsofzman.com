        The originalStar Trekseries was what good science fiction offers: an optimistic view of the future. And men get there by using their minds and their bodies, their intelligence and their emotions.  It was a band of swashbuckling brothers seeking out new adventures. It emphasized science, technology, engineering and the power of the logical mind.Good point aboutStar Trek the next generation. Some episodes are good but it is the corporate division, and Picard is a dull, efficient bureaucrat.The rebooted series had a chance to recapture that spirit but blew it. At the end of the 2009 movie they showed Spock and Kirk walking together as a team. It was a powerful moment. By the next movie, Spock was being a tattletale against Kirk over some silly rule infraction. Hollywood either cannot understand the bond between heterosexual men or they are actively hostile to it.

            Trek –“Hollywood either cannot understand the bond between heterosexual men or they are actively hostile to it.”They don’t now but they did; that very bond you speak of was the basis for several films of late, great Director Sam Peckinpah. In “The Wild Bunch”(1969) the West is changing, the bunch is getting older, &amp; running out of banks to rob &amp; places to run. In the end, they sacrifice it all to bring back one of their own. In “Cross of Iron” (1977) a highly decorated non-com butts heads with an elitist superior while trying to hold his platoon together on the Russian Front. When the non-com refuses to bear false witness for a battlefield decoration unearned, he &amp; his platoon are left to the mercy of the Russians during a retreat. In “Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid” (1973) one friend is forced to turn on the other &amp; hunt him down. It’s a story about two men who really love &amp; respect one another (not in a queer way) forced by circumstance apart.Hollywood used to get it. They don’t anymore.

                The 2005 version of Billy the Kid is certainly one of the greatest westerns ever made. I think Peckinpah would approve of the reconstruction job.
As an aside, Braveheart catches a lot of flack for its historical innacuracies, but as amannerbundfilm that revolves around thevolkgeistand the masculine virtues–now maligned as toxic masculinity, alas–its a tour de force.

                I would also put Master and Commander in there.  A group of men banded together against the weather, enemy, circumstances, grows together and accomplishes missions.   Probably the last of the “men” stories.

                Of course.  Who populates Hollywood now?  Not men for certain.  Just “boys” pretending to be men—if that.  Go back to the golden days.  WWII occurs, and the Hollywood “elite” spring into action.  One after another standing in line to enlist.  None needed to see combat, but most all insisted, or no enlistment.  Clark Gabel for example, was a door gunner.  He would brook no bond selling tours.That year’s academy award winner, Jimmy Steward, stood in line, was rejected as “underweight, went home and worked out for months to return and pass the physical.  He flew missions over Germany and was so damn good he was promoted to squadron commander—a desk job.  However, he was noted for flying missions on the side—frowned on, but not uncommon.  He was finally promoted to Brigadier General in the reserves.I can go on, but you get the picture.  We are not once we once were.

                        The biggest I would say out of hand was John Wayne—the so called man’s man.
I leave the door open for other contributions.
I never said there were not exceptions, only point to general differences in the populous then and now.
Two modern *stars* worth mentioning were Roger Starbuck and Pat Tillman.  Roger volunteering for Vietnam, Tillman for 9/11 Sandbox wars.  Of course these stars were Alpha men to begin with. Tillman for his troubles was killed by friendly fire, while Roger only lost productive athletic years.

                                I never heard that, but upon investigation you are correct.  It was rumored.  The later version of Tillman’s death (3 shots to the head) is suspicious in the extreme.  Nonetheless, that Tillman left a multimillion dollar career to serve a nation attacked remains the main point.
In truth, at that time I was prepared to serve as did a number of us old (just under 40) farts.  Did some range training with a number of the call-ups from the Reserves.
That was then, this is now.

            Was it? Hey – liked it as much as anyone and it was a cornerstone of my youthful TV viewing too… but really… it was just space opera. It has been done since the 40s in the days of Asimov.

            “Good point aboutStar Trek the next generation. Some episodes are good but it is the corporate division, and Picard is a dull, efficient bureaucrat.”
The original Star Trek was a Western set in outer space (“Wagon Train to the stars” is how Gene Roddenberry pitched it to NBC executives).  There are several ST:TNG episodes in which Picard or RIker envy the freedom of action that Starfleet captains of Kirk’s era had or they lament the obstacles they have to face from bureaucratic meddling by the Federation or Starfleet Command.

                “The measure of a man” was my favorite TNG episode, where Picard is forced to advocate for Data after a scientist claims the right to deconstruct and study Data as he is not “sentient”. The scene with Whoopie Goldberg about slavery was well done.

            These are the same freaks who can’t understand the friendship between Sam and Frodo in LOTR…a novel and film largely devoid of women with a couple notable exceptions.
I’ve always believed that the people responsible for trying to gay-up normal male bonds never had a genuine friend.

        I often see this “bond between men” thing in many shows of the old days. Whilst I’m just under forty, I do remember watching the originalStar Trekas a youngster, and finding it great fun. Everything about it, to me, was epic. Of course, at the time, the idea that this was a story about male kinship and what bunches of blokes close together can achieve, was lost on me. Perhaps that’s why I watch so many older shows now – this group behaviour is unapologetically represented.This is absolutely an aspect of manhood that women don’t really seem to get. It’s one reason that the idea of letting women into the Armed Forces, for example, holds no sway with me. Womensimply don’t form the same sort of bonds that men form. Of course, it is this very reason that entities that become dominated by females have an entirely different dynamic.Many years ago, when I was starting out as a desk jockey, I worked shuffling files for an old time building contractor. The banter and joking was legendary, the office personnel and their attitudes coming right out of the 70s. Had one guy, a black guy, whose nickname was “Bones”. He used to come into work, always smiling, yet getting berated by his project manager who often belittled him. But he took it well, he was a nice fellow to be fair.One day, old Bones comes in wearing a belt buckle saying “England” on it. Project manager: “Oi Bones, what t’fuck ya wearin’ that for? You ain’t English, are ya?”. Everyone laughed. Despite what outsiders (especially Leftists and women) would think, Bones was well liked and good company. People just had a laugh and nothing was off limits.Men form strong, deep bonds. And we can go years without speaking, and then, just like that, we speak again as no time has passed.Hope you and all readers are well, Z. God bless you all.

            “Womensimply don’t form the same sort of bonds that men form.”   What’s more, the presence of women in male roles will divide, weaken, and on some level embitter and humiliate men.

                Tell me about it.Just got back from yesterday’s Thanksgiving with family out of town.  Can’t help thinking about it.  At the dinner table—getting smaller each year as us oldsters pass on—were the women and we are blessed with small grandchildren from the two youngest.  Women who raise children have my greatest respect.  You must be “bred” for it.  Pun intended.As I sat quietly at the table with the other grown men, I thought about what was occurring this Thanksgiving as compared to others I’ve experienced, especially as I experienced such in the last couple of decades and compared it to my youth.Thanksgiving prayers are no longer said.  Nor is seating according to any standard—a 5 yo can be seated at the head of the table!  The women sat the grandchildren at the large table and this completely distracted from any meaningful, in depth conversation.  The discussion was completely taken over by the women and was totally meaningless drivel primarily centered on the children who required constant attention—and they got it.  But the real depressing aspect was the other men also seemed to join in on such nonsense.  Children and their needs are important, but is last week’s fever or runny nose a meaningful subject? Or whose book on child rearing is currently being read?  Obviously not for me and my (former) role in the family.When the main meal was over, the women cleared the table and in 10 seconds or so, the men moved seats such that we were all across from each other and a real—or at least male—conversation began that discussed work, financial futures, and other such “masculine” concerns.  No, not political arguments per se.  We do have our limits.This had me thinking during the trip home just how different things are now than before.  The answer I’ve come up with is the feminization of society which seems to affect the men in our family as well.  Another one is how the (American) culture has changed from my European roots.When I was small, children *never* sat at the “adult” table. It was a great coming of age event when your father/mother let you sit at the adult table—with of course the proviso you kept your mouth shut and listened. The conversation topics seemed different as well, or at least were not so centric on the children, their upbringing, and (cute) foibles.Well, perhaps I’ve just lived too long and am growing old…. It’s not my house, so I accept what is offered thankfully.  It just doesn’t feel the same however and I can’t help feeling it doesn’t bode well for the future.

                    This had me thinking during the trip home just how different things are now than before. The answer I’ve come up with is the feminization of society which seems to affect the men in our family as well.I was thinking about this before I responded and I think it’s not just Feminism, it’s Liberalism in general that’s at the root of all this.Thanksgiving prayers are no longer saidHey, no need to bring God into this. (Sidebar: I was honored the first time I was allowed to say Grace before a big family dinner.)Nor is seating according to any standard—a 5 yo can be seated at the head of the table!Everyone’s position is equal and we all can equally contribute to the conversation. And it’s sexist to have the Man of the House at the head of the table.The women sat the grandchildren at the large table and this completely distracted from any meaningful, in depth conversation. The discussion was completely taken over by the women and was totally meaningless drivel primarily centered on the children who required constant attention—and they got it.Again, we can all equally contribute to the conversation and parents are supposed to take every waking moment to fuss and obsess over their children don’t you know. I mean however will they get into a “Good” college if you don’t?But the real depressing aspect was the other men also seemed to join in on such nonsense. Children and their needs are important, but is last week’s fever or runny nose a meaningful subject?Men have to “Take Up The Burden” of raising their children or they’re a Deadbeat Dad and Thank God we have all these Strong Women to remind them when they screw up the child rearing.When the main meal was over, the women cleared the table and in 10 seconds or so, the men moved seats such that we were all across from each other and a real—or at least male—conversation began that discussed work, financial futures, and other such “masculine” concerns. No, not political arguments per se. We do have our limits.“More important, the concepts of brotherhood and the noble male life had pretty much disappeared from the culture.” – ZFunny thing, they keep pushing their way back in.When I was small, children *never* sat at the “adult” table.Same here, and same when we hosted a Thanksgiving or Christmas meal for the family as adults.It was a great coming of age event when your father/mother let you sit at the adult table—with of course the proviso you kept your mouth shut and listened. The conversation topics seemed different as well, or at least were not so centric on the children, their upbringing, and (cute) foibles.Something’s changed, and one thing I think is the loss of the idea that there are “adult” spaces (And I don’t mean the Pink Pony ‘Adult’ Lounge) that children should be kept separate from. Alternatively the idea it’s allowable for adults to have a life and interests separate from children seems to be verboten. As an example, breweries and distilleries. What is the primary focus of a brewery? To brew and sell beer, often to be drunk on site. What is the primary focus of a distillery? To distill, age, and sell spirits for consumption, often on site. Being in the US, one must be 21 to purchase and consume alcohol.Yet many breweries and distilleries are “Family Friendly” and I see people bringing in children in baby car seats and strollers into each and have to wonder “you couldn’t find a baby sitter?”Not to mention the older children that run around unsupervised like little hellions.The idea that there are adult spaces (Where Adult does not equal Sex) where adults can be free of children and free to talk far away from “prying little ears”. seems dead and buried.It just doesn’t feel the same however and I can’t help feeling it doesn’t bode well for the future.I dunno, I think a lot of guys are tired of the Girlboss shtick and being told that being male makes them deficient.

                        Very well put.  Thanks for the addition to the original post.  I just had to get it out there—I feel better now.  😉
It is a bit better when folks come to my house.  I manage the seating and keep the women and children to at least one side of the table, the men on the other.  Pre and post dinner, I’m usually successful in dragging most men from the Family Room and Kitchen to the (blessed) isolation of the Living Room.

            One day, old Bones comes in wearing a belt buckle saying “England” on it. Project manager: “Oi Bones, what t’fuck ya wearin’ that for? You ain’t English, are ya?”. Everyone laughed. Despite what outsiders (especially Leftists and women) would think, Bones was well liked and good company. People just had a laugh and nothing was off limits.Many decades ago I worked in a garage during my summers off in college that had an all  male staff. Shop managers came and went and one summer we had an older black man named Johnny as a manager.Normally we all wore mechanic’s overalls, including the managers, but one day Johnny came in in a shirt, tie, dress shoes and pants. One technician looked at him and said to him “Hey Johnny, why are you dressed up so fancy?”Without missing a beat another technician said aloud “Ain’t you heard? Johnny went to the Doctor and the Doctor told him “Johnny, you’re impotent.” Johnny figured if he’s impo-tant he better dress impo-tant.”The entire shop and Johnny burst out into laughter, although Johnny teased “I’ll get you for that!”, through his laughter. Today we’d all be hauled into a “Sensitivity Session” by Corporate HR.Women simply don’t form the same sort of bonds that men form. Of course, it is this very reason that entities that become dominated by females have an entirely different dynamic.Women always “claim” they can be “One of the Boys” but they really can’t because their emotions override their attitude and they go “crying off to teacher” over what for guys is a little “busting of balls”.Soon everybody walks around on eggshells because goodness knows what you’ll say that will set them off.Men form strong, deep bonds. And we can go years without speaking, and then, just like that, we speak again as no time has passed.Men can communicate effectively, and often with fewer words, than gals. Indeed, we are suspect of men that talk like women and gab on without saying anything. In the old days, a “What are you, a chick?” would be the response to someone whining or prattling on.

                mmack,So true. All of it.It’s all so evident now that I’m a parent of three young boys. We take them to these play areas, and you can immediately see a difference between the girls and boys.Boys are simply more rambunctious and get on with things. The girls cry and tattletale no end! Of course, there are exceptions, but those seem to be rare.My favourite retort to my wife (or female relations) when they start emoting about something, or asking why I don’t seem to care about something is: “I’m not a woman”.One thing that all women do seem to do is obsess, in a way men do not, over what other women and men think of them. Seems to dominate their thoughts.Hope you and yours are well.

        Star Trek TOS reruns were an after-school TV staple for many a boy growing up. What we didn’t notice at the time was how Jewish that show was. The pilot episode, “The Cage” (aired as the two-part “The Menagerie”), abounds with Jewishness. An alien race of Talosians are living underground on a planet whose surface was devastated by war with specimens collected from all over the galaxy whom they manipulate with illusions drawn telepathically from their respective memories—happy experiences as a reward, terrifying ones as punishment. TheTalosianshave become so caught up in living through others’ lives, we are told, that they have lost the ability to live life on their own, even forgetting how to maintain the civilization they inherited. How interesting!As in Star Trek, our rulers mesmerize us with visions of a utopian future ranging from mass migration to the Ukraine conflict. It’s not so much that they are lying to us as it is that the illusion has become more important to them than the reality. So-called misinformation must by all means be suppressed, since, quoting from “The Cage”, “they can’t actually make you do anything you don’t want to do”. TheirAchilles’ heel, according to the teleplay, is an inability to break through anger and primitive thoughts. That may explain why they have yet failed to convince Putin he’s losing, or to put Haitians off their dietary habits. In “The Cage”, the problem was resolved through a quarantine of Talos IV. Of course, that is the exact opposite we can expect from our elites with Jewishness.

        Yup Star Trek to Captain America, Hollywood must snuff all our iconic (and positive) male exemplars because Hollywood — like elite America — is anti-masculine.  Not enough groceries in the bags.  They damn sure don’t hide their loathing of us, either.They’re afraid of brotherhood taking root in America, to which the OP alludes.  That’s what keeps them up at night; it’s really the only threat they have to fear.  So they belittle males while dissing and separating dad from the family unit, then celebrate single women, single motherhood, and the associated Welfare State.  Nice going LBJ!The Prog agenda has been ruinous for the nation’s sons, ejected from its bounty, and that’s why the place is failing.  The U.S. is a Longhouse.  Its hub is a world-devouring, corrupt District named for their idiotic goddess, Columbia.  P.S. that’s also where they keep their political prisoners.  Constitution what?The Capitol Rotunda features the Apotheosis of Washington . . . Gen’rul George enthroned upon clouds, surrounded by a gaggle of female deities.  Who needs Jesus, we’re our own gods now!

            I never did a deep dive on this because I bailed out of Marvel long ago, but it’s crazy how, after the last Avengers, how many of their products were “old stale pale male hero is stepping aside, passing the torch to this stunning and brave woman/black guy.” And of course, they made sure to humiliate all the heroes on their way out. Of course, this entire franchise collapsed immediately after and in a fit of desperation, Disney backed up the Brinks truck to bring Robert Downey Jr. back. RDJR’s character in these movies was so popular because he essentially was just a handsome rich chad, basically playing 80’s Trump, especially in the first movie. It’s crazy how few people in Hollywood get this and they are just totally incapable of getting it.It’s telling that even after decades of rot, people instinctively seek this sort of character out, even without understanding it, and reject any attempts to establish another archetype as the lead.

                I don’t play computer games but doods that do reported a similar New Woman Order ‘diversification’ of gaming scripts and products.
Nobody bought the stuff.  Word travels fast in that sub-community and only the ideologues and fembots wanted Mary Sue Kickass at the center of their gaming episodes, along with p.c.-sensitized scripts.
I dunno what they did to get around it… maybe used older product versions that are pre-woke.  Culture war is omnipresent.

        “There are groups like the Old Glory Club forming up for young guys to join. They may not have had these concepts fed to them as children, but the seeds are still there.”I hate to see that the Boy Scouts have almost disappeared and that military service  is greatly diminished as a place for men to bond in service to a greater purpose.  I am glad that team sports and even fraternities haven’t been extinguished, but they are not for every man.  The local volunteer fire department is a group I contribute to, but was never able to actually serve in.   I am heartened that groups like Old Glory Club and other identitarian groups are springing up and I’d love to see Catholic or other Christian men’s groups for young men gain traction.   (I have girls)   Time for me to get out there and be of service to the younger folks.

                        Total nonsense with a grain of truth to make it sound plausible. As an old scout leader let me tell you the truth, not the Wiki bullshit.Any organization such as the Boy Scouts or Priesthood attracts scum such as pedo homo’s. However, unlike the Catholic hierarchy, the Scout hierarchy did not advocate nor hide homosexuality (Note: At that time) and instituted many precautions against sexual abuse.For one, Scout masters had training wrt interactions with boys. Long and short, you were never allowed to interact alone with boys under your guidance. I never was on an outing where there were not several adults in attendance with the boys. Same with local meeting for merit badge work and such.Second, whether public knowledge or not, the Scouts did not want, nor admit homo’s—suspected or otherwise. Scout masters in my years of experience were *never* single men. If there was a rumor even of any such untoward interactions, the Scout master “disappeared” (left the role of active volunteer).Third, a good portion—perhaps 30% of the scouts—were there because they were in need of good masculine role models. Single mothers often dragged their “fatherless spawn” to us for “guidance”. We did what we could, but being a father is full-time and some of these kids were, to say the least “quite confused.” I can imagine lawsuits from these as a version of the “ghetto lottery” we often speak of.But yeah, homosexuality *did* kill the Boy Scouts, because the homo lobby wished to destroy the Scouts as they do all such organizations. First they wanted a “don’t tell, don’t ask” policy for scouts—and got it through boycotts and lobbying against the use of public facilities for Scouting use. Then, likewise for Scout masters. The homo lobby forced these people in with full knowledge of the result.Of course, “gay rights” is the kiss of death for any organization and enrollment declined. Then the National BSA organization came up with the idea to admit females to advanced scouting in hopes of rescue and increased membership, and that was the final straw. The Mormons pulled out and the Catholics balked.Scouting is dead, but it was a victim—not a perpetrator of the homo agenda.  The only amazement I have of this outcome is how short a time period the process took—less than 20 years.

                    Do you think that it is unlikely that fathers would want to gather with other fathers to instill good values in their sons without there being lascivious intent?
I guess it’s part of my faith that such organizations are possible, but I guess I could be wrong.  Hope not.

                This is why my sons former scout troop disbanded. One of the boys there brought his younger sister along and initially the other boys were a bit wary, but that wariness turned into disgust when the sister began bringing her friends to the meetings.My son and the other boys told the scoutmaster they were leaving and the guy knew it was coming, so he wasn’t surprised. Dealing with his friend who brought his sister along wasn’t as easy. When my son explained the decision to his him, the kid got his nose bent out of joint because he felt that my son was betraying their friendship. My son toldme that his friend simply couldn’t understand his decision and then finally in a fit of pique, my son told me that laid into the other kid and told him, “Things were fun until you brought Carrie here. Then she started bringing her friends here and now instead of us working as a team, we have Carrie and her friends constantly interrupting us, making comments instead of helping and your sister constantly yelling “Stop, you’re doing it wrong!” At everyone and you wonder why me and the others are leaving?”This eventually led to a heated argument between the wife and I when this same girl came looking for money to raise for her Eagle Scout project and I told her no. The wife of course took issue with my decision, citing the fact that we had been friends with the parents ever since we moved into the neighborhood and I told her I didn’t care, Carrie had no business being in the Boy Scouts, let alone being an Eagle Scout.

                    yep, i remember as a child building forts.  “don’t tell the girls” and “no girls allowed”.  someone would always falter.  i cannot imagine the horror if girls were part of my boy scout troop.  funny, i cannot remember exactly why the aversion to girls.  something to do with the adventure for the day and not having any stragglers.  girls were ok at foursquare and skip rope, but always the prime target in dodgeball.  very few girls would attempt dodgeball and i never saw a girl play kill the man with the ball.  puzzling, the girls were bigger too.  now i do remember the biggest kid in grade school was a girl.  she had taken a shine to me and easily knocked out the front teeth of my daily rival.  wow, the power.

                    A little of both. Membership and financial support were both on the skids, so they assumed that allowing girls in would help. They were wrong, of course, because, as Steve highlighted, girls have a way of ruining anything they come within a fifty-foot radius of.

                        A large part of that argument was the wife saying, “You can’t blame this on the girls. The mothers that run Carries troop won’t do things like camping, hikes and canoe trips. Their idea of a big day for the girls is going to the spa. The girls like Carrie who want more, what are they supposed to do?”It was at this point that I regretted marrying this woman and I became incredulous as I said to her, “You replace the mothers who won’t take the girls on the trips with mothers who will, you don’t demand that the girls be let into The Boy Scouts and then tell the scoutmaster “They’re your responsibility now, you find a way to make it work.” that isn’t fair to our son, or the other boys there.”She just reiterated her previous statement, to which I responded, “This is why we have so many problems in this country, you and people like you are never going to get it, even when it’s spelled out for you.”

As to girls going camping and such, what happened to “Campfire Girls”.  In my youth females went there for such activities.

                    Post Vatican II Pope JP II the Grooviest EVAR did the same thing with altar boys, otherwise known as acolytes, considered a minor order and for many a first step towards the Roman Catholic sacred orders – the priesthood. He gave the OK for girls to perform these duties and now they were all called ‘altar servers’. Predictably, the boys beat feet and the vocation pipeline, already in jeopardy, dried up. Wasn’t enough for the babes, now they’re hooting and hollering for female deacons and, of course, the priesthood.Of course, they made the guy a saint…ugh

                The Boy Scouts were targeted and destroyed by the Left.  Overrun by homos and a feminist, libertine culture.
When I grew up (mid-Pliocene) the Scouts were v popular with boys.  My brother joined for a few years and liked it.  Lotsa outdoors stuff.

            The K of C would be a possibility if the old boomer men would step aside and leave room for the young men to lead.  But they hang on until death.  My local council is basically a septuagenarian and octogenarian social club.It was particularly embarrassing during the COVID crap in my council when “men” who call themselves “knights” wouldn’t meet in person for 1.5 years, and then required so-called “vaccines” for members to meet in person.  I let the Grand Knight know what I thought of that and resigned.These “men” don’t seem to realize that the founder, Fr. McGivney, during a flu epidemic, still ministered to sick people and ended up dying of the flu.  He didn’t hide out in his basement.Fags.

                My tale isn’t quite as heroic. In 2020 my  AA group did not meet for over a year. When it resumed they required wearing a mask. In fairness it was landlord imposing that requirement.  I said approximately “I’m tired of this bullshit. Call me when they drop the mask requirement.” (For me that is pretty strong language in that group.) And a month or two later they called me.

                    Replying to Ben and Lucius Sulla.   I left ministry in the Episcopal Church a half decade before Covid and I cannot say for certain that I would have been heroic in standing up to the state and the bishop’s office going full bs online mass, etc.  I am sure that I would not have left the sick or shut-ins alone without sacraments or human contact.  Where I relocated to I noted that among those that did resist were the Orthodox and SSPX and FSSP Catholic traditionalists.    When the next “emergency” arises I trust resistance will be much stronger

                To be fair, it probably depends a lot on the local KofC chapter.  As for the old boomer men, at least in my chapter, it is more a matter of no one else having the time for leadership positions – most of the leaders are retired, and the younger members (we have a few) simply can’t make the time commitment.
I don’t recall our chapter suspending in person meetings during the scamdemic, but I may have just missed them.

        Not rain on the parade of old Trekkies, but as the original series was a bit before my time I found it brainlessly egalitarian and “civil right-sy.”
It doesn’t have a clue, nor wishes to explore, how an advanced and moral civilization would be formed.

        I think that the original seriesStar Trekwas based loosely on James Cook’s voyages of discovery aboardEndeavor.  IIRC, the original starship was namedEndeavor, later changed toEnterprise.  I don’t think I would watch the original series with as much as enthusiasm as Z-man, since my recollection is that many of the episodes were basically 60’s era morality plays, resolved according to the most avant garde 60s attitudes.

                    i know the episode you mean, but i think you have misunderstood what it was really about.  in the episode there are two groups on the planet, with one half their face white, and the other black; except the two groups have have mirror images of each other (one group is right side white, the other group is white side left).  in the end the two groups destroy their own civilization.  i would compare this to the relatively recent genocide in Rwanda, between two rival groups who were the same race.the one episode that *was* an explicit racial message was when Kirk and Uhura kissed.once you introduce aliens from different planets, the racial angle really does get minimized significantly.

A quibble.  The Hutus and Tutsi may be the same “negroid” race but are quite different in appearance (to me anyway) and I’m told were quite different in socioeconomic achievement due primarily to past colonizationof Belgium—who found/considered the Tutsi’s more intelligent and hard working.  The Belgian used them during their occupation and they prospered accordingly.
Of course, being a successful minority in a Black country is fraught with danger as we see here with Whites anywhere in proximity to Blacks.  😉

                                Yes, what I’m trying to get across is that Africa is a nation of different tribes or “ethnics”.

                        I remember that episode with Frank Gorshin, but the episode I was thinking of involved two groups of people living on a planet.  The first group (high IQ) lived in a cloud world named Stratos, while the other group lived on the ground and were basically low-IQ miners.  It turned out that the difference between the two was the presence of a gas on the ground.  Move a person from Stratos to the ground and he quickly became a violent, low-IQ ground dweller.  Sort of Steve Sailer’s magic dirt in reverse.In fairness to Star Trek The Original Series, I”m not sure how I would react to the vast majority of 60s era shows that I enjoyed at the time.  One just sees things differently now.

            “…many of the episodes were basically 60’s era morality plays, resolved according to the most avant garde 60s attitudes.”Definitely.  Actually worse, they were Roddenberry’s force feeding of nascent Leftism to the audience as was the bent of Hollywood in the late 60’s and 70’s.  Example, Kirk kissing Uhura. Miscegenation writ live for all to see.What I enjoy of the original Star Trek is the hit and miss of the (predicted) technical innovation of the future. The communicator “flip phone” now is the ubiquitous cell phone we all possess.  Their voice activated “computer” is now our Siri talking to AI software.  Computers and technical controls however always required lots of blinky lights and buttons and levels, but no touch screen and icons.  Flat screens however were on the mark.  Perhaps the biggest irony was the “prime directive”—almost always disobeyed in every episode yet repeatedly held up as a sacred guideline.  Reminds me of or GAE today.

        Shatner took every role that paid in part because after Star Trek was canceled he found himself broke and unemployed. He scraped up roles as bad guys or con men on Mission Impossible, Mannix and Hawaii 5-0 and seeing him play the villain is a real TV trivia treat.

        not sure if this is news or not, but the ST:TOS episodes were remastered in 4k with many of the matte effects redone superbly.  they really look fantastic, especially if you only ever saw the original eps on pre-HD tv.
a little OT, but if you have transporter technology (as ST universe did) then no one would really need to die.  just recreate them from a stored transporter image :). of course this would drain a lot of the drama and tension out of the stories.

            Just like the move command using file manager in Windows. It’s just copy and delete.
there was an episode in the newer version of Outer Limits where there was a glitch in teleportation. Basically copied man and sent him on the way butscrewed up and left the original instead of destroying him. Gave away the dirty little secret. Anywho, all bs for sure, never happen.

            Star Trek’s inability to fully explore the implications of the technology in its universe is a big part of why I have never been able to get into the series.Replicator tech is just as badly handled as the transporters, sub-atomic level control of matter and energy and the best thing they usually think to do with it is making themselves food or trinkets.The whole nature of the society seems off too, as hinted upon in Z’s post. Post-scarcity society would almost certainly be extremely conservative in its approach to the unknown, rather than pointlessly sending out small forces for things that go bump in the night to agitate. Witness our current society, which is post-scarcity in regards to basic needs at least, and how little risk anyone will take. Instead they can have lame catfights on Twitter about whether memes about having a family are gay or not.

            There’s a fan theory that each time someone uses a transporter in the Star Trek universe, the original person is killed and a perfect duplicate is reconstructed.  That would basically mean the final Kirk seen in “Unification” is James T. Kirk, Version # 128,748.

                There was an unexpectedy good episode in the Outer Limits reboot where teleportation creates a backup version of the person just in case the transport fails.
Due to a glitch two versions of the same woman are both alive, and the duplicate must be put to death, by the man who loves her. Or the cold-blooded aliens who gave us this technology will take it back

        The ‘Unification’ short was really beautiful and Critical Drinker’s review was elegantly done.The entire cast from the original Star Trek series were in a class on their own. As you said, they knew their audience and they also knew these fans put bread on their table. For the most part they kept their personal sexuality and politics out of their work. It wasn’t until the latest fiasco we learned that Sulu was gay. Not like anyone cared, but what did it matter anyway?I never warmed up to Next Generation, although most of the characters were okay after a few seasons. Voyager and Deep Space 9 were also a bit meh. The latest is an absolute tragedy now that the Star Trek franchise has been woke to death. I already know what garbage it is so I’ve never wasted my time watching Picard.It will be interesting to see how they farewell Patrick Stewart. At 84, he’s not far behind Shatner.

        Star Trek: Enterprise is very much a return to the tone and spirit of the original series; I consider it the best of the bunch, in fact, even though the Original is still as compellingly enjoyable as ever. It was supposed to lead to the Earth-Romulan War (that’s where the Neutral Zone comes from), so of course the addled ninnies canceled the series just when that was about to kick off.Who remembers Gary Seven, with the black cat and pretty Terri Garr? The episode, “Assignment Earth”, was a tentative pilot to a spin-off series produced at a much lower cost. Also of course, since the addled ninnies had another potential hit on their hands, they put the kibosh to that one too. (The series would’ve had Gary and Terri solving sci-fi mysteries as a 1960s ‘X Files’.)There are several alternate Star Treks, with different actors portraying the Original crew, on youtube. All quite decent. I think it would be a blast to pursue a kickstarter campaign to get an alternate Gary Seven series up and running. Just imagine the easter eggs, tropes, and nods in all directions science fiction that would be possible. Talk about the ultimate nerd fan base!p.s.- here’s just how addled the ninnies are:  They canceled Star Trek but kept the excreble Lost In Space on air.

        There was some idiot sitcom I watched back in the Before Times, when a lot of the film people were just normal guys like Eastwood and Shatner. They just happened to work in the film business.I cant remember the name of it but these aliens posing as humans on earth are crapping their pants in fear. The big galactic CEO was coming to earth to check up on them and they cleverly hyped it for an episode or two.When The Galactic Great Big Head finally arrive – it was Shatner playing the role and the studio audience came to its feet for a standing ovation.It’s sad, what they have stolen from the kids. But there are still good guys around to lead them back into good times – especially here at this site.Hope you Yanks had a great Thanksgiving…

I hate to dump on an otherwise beautifully poetic meditation, but Critical Drinker is under 50. Sam Witwer who helped bring Young Kirk to life again inUnificationis under 50. Hell,I’munder 50. I think you get a little too lost in the generational pessimism sometimes (albeit not without provocation).

            Yep.  I for one was just a child during the 50’s and really not very aware of event’s until the 60’s.  Yet, I can discuss much of the culture and times of the *40’s through the 50’s*.  This is called cultural literacy—of a sort.   Maybe I’d the exception, but I doubt it.

        Apparently, Shatner was digitally de-aged enabling him to appear. There are interesting ethical debates going on as to whether actors should be allowed to grow old and die. Nobody will actually be prevented from doing this. But discuss it we all will.Unification fixes the disaster that was the ST:Generations movie. That is the one where they kill Kirk. And they make zero bones about the fact that Picard is a wuss and Kirk is a man. And they kill off the man. Twice. In fact, earlier in the movie Kirk saves the day for an even wussier captain of the Enterprise – Cameron from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.Unification is the sendoff Kirk deserved. Not buried under a pile of rocks while Picard “mourns” patiently waiting for his Uber.Shatner was notoriously difficult to work with. Other cast members didn’t like him much. He directed ST:V which was awful. The entire movie Galaxy Quest – a classic in and of itself – asks the question “What if Shatner had a redemption arc?”I think Shatner going into space was a bigger deal than people realize. Because it was a reminder of how much of our spirit of adventure we’ve lost…an 80-something actor from a TV show has more dating than your average Picard soy boy.

        I certainly didn’t expect this take.As a long time Trekker, I found the short just this side of tawdry. It’d be one thing if it had stuck to Shatner having some sort of strange &amp; unexplained afterlife experience, but then they had to put Nimoy’s face in there, Nimoy who is long dead and who had a falling out with Shatner late in life and they were no longer on speaking terms. I understand that Nimoy’s estate supposedly signed off on it, but it still felt almost ghoulish.The whole thing is CG enhanced cartoon imagery intended to tug on nostalgic hearstrings. Aww, Kirk &amp; Spock finally get some kind of good bye, isn’t that sweet.It would have been more honest if it had just been pure animation. As it stands, it feels like a case of, “Just because youcando something, doesn’t mean youshould.”

Quite true. For me star trek as always been pure trash and the generation raised on the religious tales of the next generation just made me hate the all thing.
