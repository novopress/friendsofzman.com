        Among with most visitors to this site, I find it unlikely that blacks are more severely punished per se- they are punished more because they commit more offenses. The other issue is that, because of the sheer volume of black crime, blacks might be punished LESS severely on average, as the threshold for what constituted crime is defined upward for blacks.

        What is Marshall saying- that blacks are punished more severely, or that whites are?

            I think that’s the claim. Race hustlers in the sporting press have been making this charge for years now, so it is safe assume Marshall is repeating it.

        Of course this was payback on Brady for not attending the invite by HNIC to the White House after the Pats won the SuperBowl.
Obergruppenfuhrer Jarrett probably ordered it herself.

        When a man is to stupid to even understand when he is embarrassing himself perhaps it’s for the best that he can’t grasp that.

        A few quarterbacks have commented that they cannot tell the difference between two footballs when one is inflated 1 1/2 lbs less than the other.  They felt it made no difference in their performance.I guess it made no difference because the Patriots performance was better in the 2nd half when allthe footballs were inflated properly.
This was a calculated hit on the Patriots which most of the league players and owners don’t like.  This was “payback”.   Get even time.

        Maybe if Brady had punched his woman in the face and knocked her out he might get punished but he brings big bucks into the league so ……that just lets the air out of this story.
