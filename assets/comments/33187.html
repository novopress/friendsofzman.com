        The saddest thing about learning about American involvement in the Middle East, hell with Muslims generally, is that the Iranians may have a point with this “Great Satan” business.
At every chance, if the USG can fuck over the native Christians, that’s the option chosen. Always.

            I was looking that up today – the decimation of Christian populations in places the (((United States))) creates chaos.
Syria’s Christian population has declined 75% since 2011
Iraq’s Christian population has declined from ~1.5MM to less than 250k since 2003
And of course, for (((OUR GREATEST ALLY))), Christian population was near 8% in 1948, now less than 2%

            Yeah, one need not endorse the Muslim nutjobs and fanatics, of which there are many, to see that they have a point.
Exactly what does ZOG offer them? Feminism, pornography, promiscuity, homosexuality, consumerism, Zionism, usury, and financial swindles if they go along with the program and become “democratic,”  and death from the ZOG military of they don’t.

        That aside, a country run by a distinct and distrusted minority is never going to be stable, especially when the minority is tiny.
Unless that minority can pretend to be a part of the majority. Neat trick.

            Yes. But recent events with Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh Benjamin’s Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh foreign media star and reservation gatekeeper agent show that the enlisted minorities are hip to the game. Even if the fading and as yet cowed majority will not dare say things much less even dare to claim they are a distinct ethnic/racial group, these enlisted minority coalition partners smell blood and they are setting fires in the bushes to flush out the game.As enraging as it is that the still majority doesn’t have a single person with the moral courage to explicitly declare themselves a champion of a distinct ethnic/racial group, it is amusing to watch the gollum’s expose the highly competent minority. It is a guilty pleasure to watch them squirm and admit that they are White but it depends on what you mean by White. It is only a matter of time before even the junior partners figure out that the equivocation means I am when I need to cloak myself to them and I am not when I want to separate myself for protected class purposes.I suspect some clever Tweeting and message board trolling could show the junior partners that certain practices go back into ancient times. In fact, it could be pointed out that pre-meditated genocidal conquest as well as beguiling the outsiders by dividing the clan and going amongst them as friends are both well documented in the Good Book.As Z points out, at some point tyranny must be overtly rolled out to keep the lid on the pot. That will only draw attention to the steam and the lid rattling over on the burner. Bribes work, until diminishing returns and, well, you know what they say about the Danegeld. At some point, the tyranny is very likely to be turned against its architects and initial stewards.Interesting times. We need to keep our heads down and focus on self preservation. For now it is families and the awakened in emergent networks building resilience for the purpose of self preservation. The numbers will grow. For the rest, it is out of our hands now.

                The internet has helped awaken a lot of people. It doesn’t take a lot to show the deception, and there’s not really a response to prove otherwise. It’s why the gatekeepers have such a hard time and do everything that they can to change the subject rather refute the claim.
There’s also the rise of other minorities. The Indians are coming, indeed have arrived. They know who they’re deal with. Heck, they use them as role model. There’s already tension. King Cobra doesn’t want to be some lawn jockey.

                    Yes. And even though he was shut up and forced to change his tune to ascend and consolidate a position of political power, that doesn’t mean he has changed his mind. It probably means he has given extra notice and has a seething resentment for being put in his place.
He isn’t the first, he isn’t the last. Whack-a-mole will only lead to more noticing by more and more powerful people who are ascendent.

            I doubt a very high percentage of AINO residents could answer with any accuracy the question of who rules over them. Certainly a ridiculously high percentage would say the president, or congress, or something stupid like that. Even the ones who know it is not those entities (including me) still have a tough time pinning it down with any specificity. Thus it is somewhat superfluous that they pretend to be part of the majority, since nobody knows they (or which of them) are in charge anyway.

                    That’s a great scene. If one looks at let’s call it the globalist impulse, then things like corporations, fiat money, mass media, and now AI are just tools to further degrade the self-integrity of each person on the planet. Maybe AI is the final tool to complete the job of making the entirety of humanity into a mindless hive and the globalists will succeed in their dream of a universal government.
On second thought, nah.

                People cannot identify it because it’s not really a single ethnic group (minority) that is ruling over us.  This is where I part ways with the antisemites who are sure the ruling ethnicity is the small hats.  They have disproportionate power, but they are only part of it.  It’s a coalition of freaks, various minorities and traitorous White people.  When we win, our modern Sobibor will be a utopia couse it will be a very diverse place.

It’s interesting to try to watch the internal conflicts between these groups to determine their relative strengths.  Black women supported OJ, to the surprise of white feminists, for example.
Is there a single cause that makes these disparate groups allies?  It seems like there must be.  I submit that the cause that binds them is hatred of traditional whites.

                        They make no secret of their binding glue.  Read their (endless) screeds, articles and dissertations.  Note their targets in the workplaces, schools, courts.
They are organized around a seething resentment of, and hatred for, straight white males . . . though in general they hate masculinity across-the-board.
Especially they hate Christian white males, because these are the remnant representatives of Hateful Oppressor Patriarchy.  Which exists exactly nowhere in New Amerika.  But that’s the straw man they keep burning down.

                                I don’t see it, amigo, but I appreciate your response.  White women in America are the most privileged, empowered and entitled group — outside of ‘royalty’ — that has ever existed on Earth.Corporations and academia and the general workplace aren’t blacklisting them (like white males) but welcoming them with open arms.  For fifty years and counting.In the second half of the 20th Century, white women ruled America and were the front lines of P.C., when it was called that.  The heart ‘n soul of the Demoncrapic Party.White women were the giddy, joyfully dancing nurses during their beloved Plandemic.  Enraptured by the attention and power the Scamdemic brought, and many look back on the lockdowns, masks and distancing with longing.As they gobble anti-depressants fruitlessly.If the open-border invasion continues as the regime’s holy grail, and the elite turns to the Of Color Female, then I can see a day when white women may feel what it’s like truly to be oppressed and abused.  Right now they’re the Gold Standard, unmerited.

                                    Compared to non-whites, white women are anything but privileged for the simple reason that they are tainted by whiteness. AINO’s most privileged people are negroes and pervs of various and sundry stripe. When it comes to the Left’s victim/oppressor matrix, white women are classed in the second category, although like Jews, many of them don’t realize it.And while it’s true that white women were dreadful Kovid Karens and most HR shrews are also white women, it is also true that they voted for Trump 53/46 despite intense pressure from the Power Structure to vote their plumbing rather than their race. Having done so will only solidify their position in the Left’s crosshairs.

                                        I think a lot of white females that voted Trump truly were worried that the combo of the elites and the Progs were gonna finish-off America, with open borders, DEI, intentional inflation and all the rest.
Many of those women held their noses and voted for Donald.  They were less interested in seating a black female president than in continuing their relatively easy lives.

                        Blacks will only support other blacks if the political litmus test has been passed. Which tells me that blacks do as they’re told, by someone… it’s not like they are innately liberal Democrats, bound to suburban white shitlibs by some common view of life.When Larry Elder challenged Gavin Newsome in a recall referendum, the LA Times and other media outlets dubbed him “the black face of white supremacy.” Blacks voted overwhelmingly for the governor.At a guess, if instead of murdering two people, OJ decided to go into politics and run as a Republican, he’d have likewise been called “the black face of white supremacy” or maybe – as Clarence Thomas was called by a magazine targeted to blacks in the nineties (I forget the name) – “a lawn jockey of the far right.”Blacks, in the aggregate, are easily confused by their thought managers. They’ll go all in on the blackity black except when not, because reasons.

                        Yes and no.  The best way to think of jews controlling the US is akin to a publicly traded company.  Sure, Exxon may have 120,000,000 different shareholders.  But if one shareholder holds 5% of the stock, and the next largest shareholder has 0.1% of the stock, guess who has effective control?

                        Yes, I agree.  Criticism of them is severely punished in short order.There are no shortages of Jews who are a problem.  They do have control of certain things.  But they have lots and lots of help.  There are lots of other bad actors.
In short, they are a problem, but they are not THE problem as the antisemites like to say.  At least in my opinion.

                    Agree and disagree. Here’s where I agree. Jews don’t control everything. Let’s not give them more credit than they are due. Yes, there are other powerful factions among the elite.However, I disagree in the sense that no other faction of the elite is 1) as cohesive; 2) multi-generational; 3) as willing to blackmail and threaten; and 4) has an intelligence agency (Mossad) with all the things that a good intelligence agency can do working for it.Jews are only one of several powerful groups in the US, but they operate at a very different level. No other group can go toe to toe with them. They are the apex predator of the elite.

            I disagree with this sentiment. They pretend to be part of the majority when it benefits them, and then pretend to be minorities when that benefits them.The real differences with America’s situation compared to Syria is two pronged.1) The Alawites were in charge, and this wasn’t obfuscated or lied about. Everyone knew. In America, they’ve done a neat trick where they’ve largely convinced the majority that they’re actually the ones in control, and all the poor minorities are still brutally repressed. This is despite the fact that we see all the systemic discrimination against the majority in government and private corporations. Don’t believe your lying eyes, or you’re a bad person.2) They’re actively engaged in a plan to turn the majority into a minority. Something the alawites never had a prayer of doing.

                    Read Curt Doolittle. He argues (correctly in my opinion) that Jews (and Semites in general) employ a feminine style of warfare. Subversion, propaganda, etc., rather than direct attacks. Granted, the Israelis use masculine warfare at times, but they’re kind of forced to do that. They prefer regime change.

        The US commenced Operation Timber Sycamore.  Our CIA spent 1 billion on weapons arming rebels (AQ and later ISIS) to overthrow Assad.  The Arabs assisted the rebs as did Israel and Turkey.  Later, the US sent troops in , ostensibly to fight ISIS but we took control of their relatively small but still lucrative oil fields and deprived Assad of revenue.  Of course Russia assisted and turned the tide but sanctions and loss of oil revenue prevented Assad from even paying his army at the end.   Regardless of his minority status, Assad would still be in power in Syria if not for our intervention.

            The US intervention was motivated by Israel’s desire to remove the pro-Hezbollah Assad regime. With Hezbollah isolated from their Iranian allies and thereby weakened, Israel would have an opportunity to seize southern Lebanon and its water resources, which Israel has long coveted. They might also get a slice of southern Syria in the bargain.

            Yeah sure, but truth does not make a zman essay.
Also the entire trouble started, when the “high-IQ” white governor from the whitest state became US president and even got re-elected to implement the promise of “bringing democracy to middle east”. Still everything is the fault of low-IQ blacks/browns, Alawite minorities and mischievous Jews.
White Christian America needs to take responsibility for this entire middle-eastern mess. It was not created by Obama or blacks or Democrats. Alawites lost control because Europeans/Americans lost respect of the region.

        It’s similar to to how Saddam’s Tikriti clan, a minority within the Sunnis, who were a minority in majority-Shia Iraq, were put in power by the Brits. He then became a client of the Americans, who helped him in the Iraq-Iran War of the 1980s. When Washington got tired of him, he was lured by Ambassador April Glaspie into invading Kuwait, which sparked the 1990-91 Gulf War and all the rest.

            I did an AI search on April Glaspie. Here is what came back…“Is April Glaspie Jewish?Based on the provided search results, there is no direct information indicating April Glaspie’s religious affiliation or ethnicity as Jewish. However, we can analyze the available information:The search results mention Paul Michael Glaser, an American actor and director, who is Jewish. However, there is no connection established between Paul Glaser and April Glaspie. April Glaspie’s biography does not mention her religious affiliation or ethnicity as Jewish. The search results do not provide any information suggesting a Jewish connection or heritage for April Glaspie.In the absence of explicit information, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no evidence to support the claim that April Glaspie is Jewish. If more information becomes available, it may shed light on her religious affiliation or ethnicity. However, based on the current search results, it appears that April Glaspie’s religious affiliation or ethnicity is not explicitly stated as Jewish.”Hmm…

                Remember when publicly available “AI” hadn’t yet been “aligned” (retarded) and its gaydar was almost infallible—stronger than the strongest pervert’s? That was AI’s first real breakthrough into public consciousness, its firsthit. (LOOK AT THESE FAGS, the headlines nearly shouted.) Now it can’t even look at pictures, because…

Well, the excuse was: It thinks black women are gorillas because photography is racist. Racism in, gorillas out.

Youcan still look at pictures, though. For now.

            I heard about Glaspie’s statements to Saddam sometime in the Fall of 90, well after the clearly fake “babies tossed out of incubators” story.  It opened by eyes. I opposed the whole thing after all that because it stunk to high heaven. The early neocons of the time including Dick Cheney who was SecDef were already doing their tricks.  Foreign troops not leaving Saudi afterwards was Osama’s stated motivation for 9/11.  It is interesting to recall that Assad’s father sent Syrian troops to fight Saddam and I believe they and the Kuwait at large army, were the first to enter Kuwait City.  All about appearances.  The US displayed their gratitude with regime change.

        You would have to look far and wide, probably in vain, to find another “majority” that hates each other as much as whites in AINO do. (Putting aside for the moment whether or not Luigi Mangione and I belong to the same ethnic group, he doesn’t look anything like me, not a similar name, but clown world says we are both “white,” whatever that’s supposed to mean). I’m not disagreeing with Zman when he saysAs soon as bad times come, the majority revolts.But here in AINO, it’s an open question if that applies, as I’m not sure that there is any majority. The closest we could hypothetically get to one is something like what we just saw at the ballot box where hispanic males align with whites. It’s why the possibilities for an American Caesar are dim; he can’t unite us when there is no us.

            The Achilles heel of European-derived people (what most just call “Whites”), is that their identity is almost entirely constructed along class, religious, or ideological lines. Virtually every other large group has some sort of tribalism as their primary self-identity. Tribalism is simply a code for race+culture. You can quibble about this and point out that Whites tend to form families within their class but it’s a matter of what comes first. For most people on the planet, their identity is mostly in their genes. For Euros, it’s something in their heads.This is of course, a huge weakness, because all that needs to happen is some group of outsiders to come along who are clever enough to manipulate Whites along class, religious, or ideological lines without themselves falling for the rhetorical tricks needed to achieve this. Now of course, no such group exists… Oh, who am I kidding. Of course (((they))) do. In fact, to paraphrase Voltaire, if they did not exist it would be necessary to invent them. Indeed Jews readily allow other groups to marry into their tribe so you could even make the case that Jews are, to some extent, self-invented themselves.Whites can’t defend themselves as an “us” because they’ve all been indoctrinated from birth to primarily hate other White groups. Even today, when I think of “the enemy”, I primarily picture some affluent WASPy Anglo shitlib from Boston or New York. Having interacted with these people from my youth, I can tell you that they feel the same about me (Italian/German Catholic and working class background). Whites will need to overcome these biases and realize that they are all being herded over a cliff by those outside their traditional ethnic rivalries.

            I take the White thing much like the Arab saying of “me against my brother, etc.”
It is somewhat defined by your opposition – Italian v. German, North Euro vs. South Euro (or East West), Euro v. Non-Euro.  Sort of concentric circles.

            Good comment!  Whites in the US are in the process of becoming a mere plurality.  Whether the “minority group” that presently governs the US can continue to rule over a brown-black majority is an open question, but my guess is no.I have heard reports that Israeli tanks are rather close to Damascus and that the US and Israel continue to systematically bomb Syrian military assets.  I’m not certain how these new “liberators of Syria” will fare against an Israeli offensive, backed by the US.  And I’ve also heard there is already fighting between Turks and Kurds in Syria.  Sometimes events have a way of spiraling out of control.

                I regularly bring up the idea of balkanization/peaceable separation of the country to MAGA types and get little pushback. They’re not as repulsed by it as a republican white would have been 20 years ago. My feeling is that they have this hope that Trump can bring back the America they remember, but they’re open to other options if he fails or things keep declining.

        “That aside, a country run by a distinct and distrusted minority is never going to be stable, especially when the minority is tiny.”Under Hafez Assad, there were some progressive reforms. For example state-subsidized electrification, made possible by the Euphrates dam. I got this nugget from Tariq Ali’s recent essay on Syria, who argues that these progressive reforms are what ensured the stability of the regime:https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/the-roads-to-damascusBut for the last so many years, this carrot-and-stick approach has been off the table as sanctions have eliminated the possibility of any carrot.There’s another informative essay at RT:https://www.rt.com/news/609099-assad-syria-collapse-crisis/And if I may paste an excerpt:“Assad’s Syria had been rotting from within for years. The country was locked in a perpetual humanitarian and economic crisis, with 90% of Syrians living in poverty and widespread malnutrition. Desperate families took out loans just to buy food but couldn’t pay them back. Power outages crippled even Damascus, sometimes leaving the capital dark for 20 hours a day. Electricity prices soared by up to 585% in the spring of 2024 alone, pushing an already destitute population deeper into despair.“The Assad government offered no solutions – only mounting repression. Under crushing sanctions, Damascus couldn’t secure foreign loans, and with its oil fields under US-Kurdish control, there was nothing left to trade. Even Syria’s illicit drug trade, once a lifeline, couldn’t plug the gaping holes in state finances. Profits disappeared into the pockets of warlords and traffickers, not the state treasury.“Meanwhile, Assad’s underpaid, demoralized army, bled dry by years of civil war, continued to disintegrate. For a time, Iranian proxies like Hezbollah propped up his forces, but by 2024, they’d shifted their attention to fighting Israel. Attempts to draw Russia further into Syria’s quagmire fell flat. Moscow, busy elsewhere, had no interest in bailing Assad out.“So when the final crisis hit, Assad found himself alone. His allies stayed away, his army scattered, and an enraged, starving populace turned on the government. There was no one left to protect him.”

        That aside, a country run by a distinct and distrusted minority is never going to be stable, especially when the minority is tiny.
Unless it is backed up by a colonial empire: there’s a limit to the oppressive excesses a minority government will risk, while an empire-backed majority will often just wipe out the competition and start scheming against their Western benefactor.
That’s why colonial powers usually choose to empower a minor local tribe over the dominant, like in Syria and Saudi and Libya.
Of course, once the empire leaves, demographic realities will kick back in.

            This is a good point.  We did very well with the Shah of Iran and Mubarak in Egypt. Saddam Hussein was manageable until he was lured into Kuwait.  Even Gaddafi was friendly at the end.  After the U.S. tried to install democracy that no one wanted, look what we have in those countries now.

        Yes, apparently the Russians got tired of supporting the Alawites and their corrupt generals, who were probably bribed to stand down against the head-choppers…According to Martynov, the Assad Regime treated the Russians and their journalists poorly, despite Putin having saved their bacon twice in the last 15 years…And it’s clearly true that a battalion or two of Russian (or Ukrainian) troops would have sent HTS and the other terrorist groups packing very quickly…

            Seems obvious that the Syrian senior officers were bribed and / or blackmailed into standing down.  Since Arab enlisted have zero initiative on their own, they took off running when they realized they’d been betrayed.

            I think the Russians tried to make the best of things, but there was no saving Assad. The Syrian army was a mess and no amount of Russian military support would fix that problem. They will make the best of what comes next, which is most likely a regional war.

            The Russian half assed it 5 years ago when they let the head choppers congregate in Idlib.  The job undone ended up undoing Syria.   Russia also did nothing and said nothing while the Israelis Air Force had their way with Syria for the last 5 or 6 years.  After their initial rescue of Syria in 2015, the Russians have not covered themselves in glory.  Hell , the US slaughtered a bunch of Wagner guys and they did nothing.

                Simplicius provides a good, evidence-backed argument in his latest post as to why taking Idlib and wiping out the terrorists there would not have been so simple.
The short version is that the US and the Turks seemed to show they were ready to go to regional war over Idlib at that time.

        “The Ottomans tried to suppress them on multiple occasions, but also found them useful in roles requiring skill, like tax farming and managing the empire’s finances.”Sounds like they had a similar role that the Jews had under the Ottomans. Maybe that’s why, as you hinted above, the two were on reasonably friendly terms, at least unofficially.—–“That aside, a country run by a distinct and distrusted minority is never going to be stable, especially when the minority is tiny. This is why the Assad government had been ruthless at times when dealing with the Sunni majority. To keep the peace, the government had to make clear to anyone thinking otherwise that the government would use maximum force to maintain the peace. Minority rule is always made worse by the tactics necessary to maintain it.”Kind of like where we are at in many respects with our own government. We’ve got a minority ruling, financial and bureaucratic class imposing their values and prerogatives on the rest of the country, and they are increasingly brutal and ham-handed in how they go about it.—–“Now that the official policy of the United States is to spread chaos around the world, Assad was an easy target for the now familiar regime change operation.”It never ceases to amaze me how we’ve become the Soviet Union in its waning years, in so many different ways. That chaos we sow destroys people’s lives, destroys families, destroys what it took them a lifetime to build. We truly have become the Great Satan, the Evil Empire. We truly deserve to be considered despicable people, like many consider us to be.

        What was true for millennia is now in doubt in the modern age of technology and mass indoctrination via mass media. Or, at least that is the working hypothesis. In the fictional novel Brave New World, the drug “soma” quelled the masses and facilitated peaceful authoritarian rule; and we know how that ended. Europe is now the petrie dish of this experiment and it will be instructive to see how things turn out. Methinks it won’t be merely words of woke persuasion that solve this problem. A bloody cauldron awaits.

            Russian policy is to always make the most of the conditions that exist. There was not much they could do to change things. As to what happens next, just assume that whatever you want to happen, will not happen and whatever you fear will happen, will not happen. The Turks and the United States are about to learn it is never good to create chaos.

        Which factor is the most important, in your opinion —  the Alawites as a cultural, genetic, or ideological minority? I think the best lens through which to view late-stage Soviet America is the lens of theocracy. They tried conversion through persuasion (the schools). They tried conversion by the sword (replacing the native population with foreigners). But  they — the stupid, evil clowns who rule us — did seem to consciously realize  that they’re a minority (of lunatics, in a majority of sane people). If that’s really the case, then AINO’s collapse will break along ideological lines. If it’s the other two, though, there will be different lessons. Syria will have object lessons however it goes, but it’d help to determine which is primary.

            If you are right, and AINO’s collapse breaks along ideological lines, this implies that some significant proportion of non-whites will align with traditional whites instead of their racial tribes, because of the Christianity or conservatism that they share with whites.
I find it hard to imagine that many non-whites will side with traditional whites because of Christianity or liberty. Of course, there will be a few, but their proportions will be small, say, less than 5%.  Maybe I’m wrong.
Do you envision lots of blacks, mestizos, or asians casting their lot with white Christians, for example, against their own tribes?

            Which factor is the most important, in your opinion — the Alawites as a cultural, genetic, or ideological minority?How to disentangle the three in this case? The ideology flows directly from being a historically persecuted genetic and cultural minority since both Shia and Sunni consider Alawites heretical, the former to a far greater degree (Shia Iran allied with the Alawites more out of expediency than religious identity and its doctrinal disagreements pale in comparison to the Sunni House of Saud’s outright hatred). Ba’athism is an attempt to thread the needle with distinct ethnicities and cultures under the guise of socialism, but its purpose is to largely protect religious minorities*. There are few if any Alawites casting their lot with Sunnis because of actual ideological or cultural affinity; the ideology creates a pretext of a non-existent unity. Culture is downstream from genetics, of course.The primary difference between Syria and the United States is the vastness of the latter. That may in fact allow for breakaway ideological states in addition to the traditional racial and cultural separations, but over time those in the former will identify and ally with the latter based on immutable traits.*As happened in Iraq, the Shabbos goy United States now has paved the wave for another Christian genocide to appease ol’ Massa Schlomo; the next time you see some Republican hack/stooge proclaiming their Christianity, remember that this political party has caused the slaughter of Christians on a scale that would make the Ottomans blush.

        Simplicius offers a fat reed: Israel may be creating two golems, and I say three.She has bought time and intends to be a power, but a rough justice will come.Nourishing the Turk and blockading the Shia is a temporary victory.  Grown stronger, ambitious Ottomans and a consolidating Sunni caliphate will gang up on Israel’s Eretz designs.  (Egypt will aid, nursing past grievances and fresh insults.  And HTS is already talking about next year in Jerusalem.)Hamas and Hiz’b’allah are only branches while the trunk of Iran is still whole.Since Iran’s direct line to the Med is blocked, they will turn their efforts to the proposed ITSC north-south corridor linking the Baltic with the Arabian Ocean, a joint desire by India, Iran, and the Arabs.  (Also Mackinder’s nightmare.)  As an oil producer, why shouldn’t Iran join Russia and look east?  Even run corridors into the ‘Stans and Russia herself?(If justice were served, a Kurdistan would be born in Idlib. They want their own state, too.)The downside is that ZATO, by sundering the re-unification of the White world, is also opening the gates to a rekindled Conquest.  Maybe the minority state can save herself by providing good service to the golems she’s creating.

        ISIS is the armed expression of Sunni resistance to the Shia rising to power in Iraq.  One the U.S. declared democracy in Iraq, the majority Shia took their opportunity to get revenge on the Sunnis.  The surge and its aftermath took a lot of the wind out of the Sunni resistance, but there was no way to stamp it out, so it metastisized into ISIS, and grew in Syria to eventually take over the place.
Maybe this is a more stable set-up in the long run, with the Shia running Iraq and the Sunnis running Syria.
