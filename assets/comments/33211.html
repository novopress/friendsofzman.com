            Derbs head cold made him sound like Alister Cooke giving a “Letter from America” talk. For some reason it made him sound more British and less mid Atlantic.  I found a certain nostalgic comfort in it.  Get well soon sir and Happy Christmas as they say over there.

        But of course, Mssr. Derb, I must roll out an oft-repeated tidbit:
I was sitting next to a Brit at the diner counter.  As we chatted, he mentioned ‘a Cartesian education.’  Being quite the uneducated Yank, it took me a moment to realize he was referring to desCartes.
I told him they say Americans are ignorant and apathetic.Well, I say’d, in my starchiest Redneck accent, I don’t know and I don’t care.

Beat iton a Chinese zither!  I now consider myself quite the cosmopolitan, instead!

            More of these childhood quips are coming back to me.
American tourist &amp; wife accost a local Brit at Runnymede. “Say, what’ this place famous for?”  Brit: “It’s where Magna Carta was signed defining the fundantal liberties of the Enlish.”  Yank: “Oh wow! When was that?”  Brit: “1215.”  Yank looks at watch, turns to wife: “Shucks, honey, we just got here a half-hour too late.”

                Ha!  I do prefer mine dry, sir; I am stirred, not shaken.
