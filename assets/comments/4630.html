        “Coordinating across platforms” is how the Left has managed to change the character of many (too many) of the People. From every level of government, to the entire Educational establishment, from the Churches to the media and entertainment, and finally to the military. There is not one institution that remains untouched by the poisonous ideology of Progressivism. Is it any wonder that the values that made Western Civilization superior to any other are fading away? At this point only a galvanizing nation-wide crisis can save us. Or be the final nail in the coffin.

        You misunderestimate the sudden  decline in character. Welfare and the entitlement mentality grease the skids down to the bottom in one generation. The German character has held up best under the welfare state, but Anglo character does not do so well.  Even the German character was destroyed in two generations under the Soviet thumb. It’s still a dead zone in the east.I’ve a friend who is an elderly Cuban. He visits the old country once a year for the last twenty five years. He told me after his last visit that the last trace of those things that made Cubans Cuban had died. Many amazing stories about what that meant, but now they are just Spanish speaking zombies. I don’t think you come back from that.Other races and ethnic groups have no resistance whatsoever, and that fuels the Progressive train down.

        The same mass-media tools that are now in the hands of the powers-that-be, will be used to identify and crush the dissidents in the room. Why? Because, as the Hindenberg that is the current state crashes and burns, that’s all they will have to perpetuate themselves. Persuasion has failed, deception has failed, cheating has been exposed, so it will come down to the iron fist.

        I could counter and say that without Ross Perot, Bush the Elder would have sailed to an easy victory.  That would be to the discredit of team Clinton though, who seized the opportunity that Perot represented, put together the slick, focused campaign, and won the election.I think that there are two ways to read the Obama victories.  One is that they had 96% of the vote of 15% of the population locked and still had to spend untold billions to win the remaining 37% of the vote (14% + 37% = 51%).  The other is the that they took the Clinton tactics to the next level and are the wave of the future.Of course I am biased towards believing that the eras of hierarchical and Gramscian control are coming to an end.  Almost every thing that the Obama campaign resorted to smacked of desperation — from the amount of money spent (and how much of it was procured) to the duplicity of much of the messaging (the AIPAC speech in particular stands out).  But I believe (hope?) that it was brilliant desperation: the last act of a political class doomed to the ash heap of history.  By way of analogy, consider all of the trouble the Brezhnev-era USSR brewed up across the Third World.  It seemed like we were on the ropes, only to find ourselves victorious.But if there had been no Reagan, Pope John Paul II, or Thatcher, would we have won?  I’m not seeing a lot of leaders of that caliber running things right now.  Maybe in some state house or board room there is a Lincoln or even a Joan of Arc waiting for the right moment.  I can’t help but believe that even if there was one, there is some opposition research team waiting in the wings to find some stupid thing they said in college, a romantic indiscretion, or bad business deal.Then I guess it it ends with the barbarian in his rough furs, sitting on the throne, being poured drink by your women, and offered the laurels of victory by your youth.  If we win, it will not be easy.

            I don’t know. Perot certainly changed the dynamics of the race. There’s a good argument for assigning his vote to Bush, if the option was unavailable. That is, the Perot vote was a protest vote. There’s also the data showing that many Perot voters were anti-Bush voters and would have gone to Clinton. My own sense is that the wort of people who voted for Perot were the sort of usually vote Republican or stay home.That said, it would have been a vastly different race and much closer. Team Bush would have been able to rely on a number of states without much effort, thus being able to campaign harder in other places where they lost. That said, Perot never would have run against a strong president. His existence was due entirely to Bush being a loser.
