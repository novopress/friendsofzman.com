        I’m not sure why people still believe voting 1. matters (provably doesn’t) or 2. is even remotely honest.Has it occurred to anyone that if they “wanted” fair elections they could very easily do it?   Yet that’s not even close to the case in our insane state systems.    It’s beyond a joke.   So ask why?  Why the heck would any state set up a system that’s so bizarre, confusing, and so easy to manipulate.  Why wouldn’t the feds pass a law stating basic voting protocols that are tamper and fraud proof?I think if you reason it out, it’s clear.Besides all that the people with power always get what they want, be it corporations or lobby groups etc.    Even WITH voting, they always get what they want, so ask yourself why even bother with voting?   It’s a fraud and was set up to be one.   Our founders knew it even with property owners.    It was always a scam and is just now so ridiculous that people are seeing through it.I only wish that the democrats had gotten 95% of the vote and that the news media would have run story after story about their great blue wave and the repudiation of Trumpians and how Biden et al are the saviors of the Universe.

        Trump 2016 : “day ONE, I will sign the order to deport 11 millions of illegals”He didn’t, prefering focusing on obamacare (as a French, I never understood what was this complicated thing, I prefer our simple and more thrifty national system with which Walter White wouldn’t have to pay for his cancer treatment) and taxes and “lowest black unemployment ratio”, and “trump vaccine”.He didn’t reform electoral laws.He didn’t instaure free speech on corporate medias.He didn’t repeal key administrators (but maybe he haven’t)He didn’t cancel alphabet administrationsHe never purged the party (heard of Stalin, anyone ?)He never reform the censusHe never ended soil nationalityAnd now, 11 more millions arrived, the late 11 millions had became new democrat electors, the propaganda machine still mindbreak those awful WHITE leftists, and America is gone.That say, situation is worse in Europe, because we don’t have gas or oil. I wonder if there is still a red state where a free man can live. Florida ?

        I take a broader perspective. The effete (the left) who are too weak to defend their civilisation, and all those who want to take over that civilisation for themselves (immigrants and racial minorities, including the Jews) are joining together to bring down the current incumbents of that hitherto white Anglo-Saxon civilisation and replace it with something closer to their comfort zone. At the moment, the two sides are in close balance, but the Meek, with the media on their side, are in the ascendant, and to my mind the increasing proportion of non-heterosexuals is swinging it.The latter is the essence of my theory (cough – which is my theory, which is what it is, and which is mine – cough). This theory is the theory that the number of non-heterosexuals in society is increasing over the generations. There have always been homosexuals, of course, and I acknowledge that they have a beneficial role—not just in the entertainment and grooming industries (essential functions of society) but intellectually, as mere observation indicates that homosexuals are at the vanguard of many creative and intellectual fields—this is perfectly sufficient explanation why they exist in nature. I submit though that their number is increasing, not simply because they are becoming more visible in today’s society, but in actual proportion. Most people probably still presume the proportion is 5%, the Kinsey-era figure. I am saying actual proportion in western countries today, by observation and extrapolation, is at least 30%.My theory is that nature produces a greater proportion of non-breeding people in proportion with the affluence of a population. I propose that the ‘genetic switch’ for non-breedingness is triggered by a subtle mechanism currently beyond our ken, as a result of: unnatural conditions such as chemicals in the body, including all of modern medicine (I predict a rise in the proportion of non-heterosexuals as a result of Covid vaccinations and all other unnatural medical interventions), air-borne pollutants, genetically modified food, and even cosmetics, unnatural levels of both stress and ease, over-population (what more natural method of population control could there be than by increasing the proportion of non-reproductive individuals?), and perhaps even quantum effects of changes in the weather (I am serious).  Perhaps this same effect was felt towards the end of the Roman Empire and contributed directly to its decline. Certainly, effeteness is an obvious correlative of affluence though I doubt the long-term effects of effeteness has ever been studied.Overpopulation and degeneracy call for a reset, or at least an adjustment on an anthropological level. I believe we are seeing both the conditions for that and the first steps of that readjustment in recent decades. The result of effeteness, history shows, is an invasion of barbarians (cf. the flood of lesser-world immigration) and a general upheaval due to the mix of cultures that will soon be in lethal conflict with each other, given human nature.Many regions are now on the brink of, or actively engaged in such upheaval and conflict as a result of the disparity between those desperate to give up out of ‘civilisation fatigue’, and those desperate to achieve their own civilisation. Civil war is the first big step on the road to readjustment, and the obvious corollary of a rash of civil wars is world war.I predict all this from the perceived rise in the proportion of non-heterosexuals in society. Put my Nobel in the post.

        If we can buy CNN exit polling, 18 to 29 year-olds voted D by a +28% margin.

            Young people do not vote in those numbers. Never have, never will.
What you have is a perfect fraud where you target sections that don’t bother (young, minorities etc) and print up the ballots for a percentage of them as you know they will never show and never check.
As the adult vote swings against you, you have to keep upping these percentages.
So it looks like massive vote preferences. But its just massive fraud and you can play the game for ever pretty much.

        I noticed that you got a new Governor of Maryland ZMan. A quick look at his policy stance and it looks like a typical radical progressive. He is intelligent enough to go light on the anti-white. He did get riled by Freddy Gray and took a minute away from giving lectures on poverty to support the Baltimore riots/protests and say systemic problems must be addressed.
His slogan is, “Now is Our Time”. I wonder how inclusive his Our is. I suspect we know how wide that circle is likely to be.

        When JFK got shot, people should have woke up and realized they are trapped in a hebrew theatre, run by madmen.The moon landing, really?  911, really? Covid, really? The jew wants you dead, your children  disabled and sterile, wake up Whitey.  You can’t vote your way out of slavery.

        It was dark and late on voting day in the Granite State. Eight hours earlier, I made my initial get-out-and-vote attempt. And this second time, and again, parking remained nonexistent, and voting lines still snaked far out onto the govt.-skewl sidewalks. I was hungry. I just couldn’t imagine trying to park and standing in that line.Perhaps this voting is a charade, maybe I am on a fool’s path. Circling the parking lot for the second time, it crossed my mind to just stop at the bar down the street and have a drink to vote. A nod to the nobleness it might once have exemplified. In contrast, my significant other-who had voted earlier-is a truer believer than I. She would have been disappointed in me for not voting. It crossed my mind to go the “Politicians’ Way.” I could tell her I went to vote. I could tell her how busy and how long the lines were. Doesn’t mean I’d have to vote, or even tell her I voted. She would just assume it. I imagined skipping all that voting shit.I just I couldn’t do that-lie to her by omission.  I left, and I went to a local fast-food joint and ordered what was a tasteless but filling shrimp scampi I was resolved to return to vote, hoping that in the final hour of polling, it would be less crowded and I would not be famished. I wasn’t famished, but it was as crowded as my last 2 attempts.The volunteer parking guy at the skewl entrance said it was the most people he had ever seen for any election. The same guy that directed me during my two earlier voting attempts. This time he told me it had been busy like that all day. Even now, the last hour of the poll being open.Lotta voters. The next volunteer, the jokey guy with the captive audience he corrals into the snakey outside line, repeated the parking volunteer guy’s claim. Murmurs of the voters around me revealed the same claim. In this minor exurban town, the low turnout did not seem to be an issue. The results are the issue.after 30 to 40 minutes, I made it inside to vote. It has appeared an incredibly efficient and on-the-level fair election process. In fact, several of the volunteers clearly represented themselves right and hard right. An ID checker at my table had an NRA camo hat and military green shirt displaying his “Scout” Navy service. He seemed no-nonsense. He would take your ID and command you to cite your address to him; all the checkers did this. I passed this test with flying colors. I don’t think Fetterman could pass this test.This morning on election result day, I was disappointed and surprised for a couple of reasons. One, the Granite State has what are seemingly principled and dignified republican candidates running for the US senate and house (Bolduc so dignified and honest Mcconnel withdrew campaign funding). Both Bolduc and Leavitt lost. Secondly, if what I saw at my polling location was representative of the state, we had a well-attended and fair election (I have no idea what the machine tabulators do, though), and finally, this AM, and with hard Granite State pride, it was reported that the existing US House member, Chris Pappas was re-elected and that he was gay. You know, first gay blah, blah, blah. Go figure, I never knew, I thought I was informed preelection. Yeah, he had that “look”-think a young Linda Grahams roly-poly face, but the Granite State press was not proud of his Pride until the day after. Then they were ecstatic. I wouldn’t have voted for him anyway, I just thought that gay candidates are celebrated, and the candidate’s gayness was to be front and center and not reported after the election.Nationally at least two main issues impact elections. The fraud is one. I don’t think voter fraud had much of an effect on the Granite state, but I think the mentally ill, zombified zoomer generation, summed with the crazies of all age groups, has reached the electoral tipping point. Zoomers are the critical mass of this perpetual crazy motion machine that finally tipped the scales.For the last 30 or so years, lower-ed govt skewls have fostered and generated more and more drugged, indoctrinated, mentally ill, and now sexually groomed fodder. This semi-finished government product gets handed off to the Higher Ed industry for finishing indoctrination. Higher ed “treats”, assuages, further drugs, and sexualizes the final product. Finally it hands the self-ID’d unit a soft credential and sends many back to the lower ed skewlz to “teach” the new generation, thus continuing the cycle. The other higher ed products become govt employees, skewl counselors, journalists, NGO units, etc. Endless fake money can pay for anything until it can’t anymore. Govts cannot produce heating oil or food.Yeah, we’re doomed. It’s going to get a lot worse before it gets any better, and I don’t have the time to wait it out. I’ll enjoy the decline best as I can. Give me another shrimp scampi dish and the remote control.

            I’ve never had to walk for more than 5 minutes to reach a polling station. And never once had to queue to vote. I live in the UK.
Serious question – Why can’t the US have polling stations within easy reach of voters? Also – Couldn’t you have taken a bus? I suspect I already know the answer to the second question.

        For years, the GOP has been telling us that we have to “hold our noses” and vote for whatever sellout cuck they throw at us. For years, we did it. And what did it get us? Worse than nothing.And now, thanks to the Trumpening, we know exactly how they treat candidates WE like. They don’t hold their noses. They don’t support them. They sabotoge them at every turn.I, for one, am done holding my nose. I’d vote for a zombie (aka Fetterman) before I’d vote for the slop the GOP is offering us these days.Screw ’em.I do believe there was widespread fraud. But I also believe that plenty of us stayed home because why should we support a party who doesn’t support us?

        A lot of copium. And refusal to face facts: it was massive, massive fraud just like 2020. And Z-Man was just wrong about the lack of national fraud scaling in the midterms, of course the model is now national and coordinated. Its not the 1980s any more, fraud is cheap and easy to coordinate with electronic voting and no possible audit. Why not? Its what the Furries who run things want.That is by design. Lets review: everyone’s standard of living is crashing. Inflation means less money every week, with massive job cuts and layoffs and shortages of everything and nuclear war looming with Russia. And there won’t be a massive repudiation of the ruling party? With 75% White voters? Look at Florida. That is diverse. It just did not have Federal Cheating and and DeSantis set up honest elections. This election is as honest as Wirecard. [Notorious fraud in Germany that was tolerated because intel/law enforcement got a look at every transaction.] It just is — no other explanation is possible.People were angry. They turned out. I saw many “F— Biden” flags on cars with honking approval. Voted for the other guy to send a message. And the election was stolen. Massively. There is no reason to think anything will ever change. The reason you have a freak like Festerman is because the party and nation is run by freaks. That’s who they are.So expect: food rationing and bugs only very soon. Mandatory gender reassignment for all White kids. A draft of White males 18-60 to go die in Ukraine in a Somme/Ypres that never ends. [A plus for the regime of freaks]. Elimination of all fossil fuels. There is no electoral consequence so there will be no check. That’s the cost of cheating. That is the problem of modern technology — every nation but Russia and China and Japan have freaks and weirdos in control. [Even Japan has a major weirdo problem.] There is something about modern technology that creates a power elite of Furries. Normal people need not apply.[Coming from a relative’s hospital room — not my normal IP Z-Man just fyi]

            Florida was Red because it’s full of old White people who have a high turnout. It’s also full of Cuban, Venezuelan, and Brazillian immigrants.Georgia was 50.1% White as of 2020 and rapidly declining. Whites are the only group that votes Republican as a whole. Therefore, Georgia will move towards Democrats.It’s just basic math. The former silent majority is now the “loud Trumper minority” driving around honking with “FUCK BIDEN” flags. For every loud “FUCK BIDEN” guy driving past there are 10 paper Americans pulling the lever for D that you don’t notice.It is what it is – loud minorities can hold outsized influence. Blaming everything on fraud is the cope. I don’t doubt fraud happens but demographics are the main thing permanently changing the voting patterns.

                Not grinding an axe, B125, but how does that explain PA? 81% white, 19% over 65. Compared to Florida, 77% and 21% respectively.

                    Non-Hispanic White is only 73% of PA. They also don’t have a huge Cuban population. Whites in Pennsylvania have also never split as strong for R as southern Whites have.
Obviously not every White person is a Republican. But as a group, White people are the ONLY group that favours Republicans more than 50%. Even in PA, Republicans still had a weak 54-46 advantage with White voters.

                        Yeah I’m trying to figure it out. Pretty sure we’ve got a lot of independents, and they’re a fickle bunch.  I used to be one, probably will be again soon. At any rate, something doesn’t sit right with me. Not just with the election, but a lot of things. Lots of conventional wisdom being broken. Am I trying to cope or do I smell a rat?

                At this point, trying to flip deep blue states is a fool’s errand. I live in SoCal and the vast majority of democrat voters are simply a lost cause. They see everything happening around them, they feel the pain at the pump and the grocery checkout, they see the squalid conditions and open criminality, but it’s like there is a shunt in their mind that prevents them from coming to logical conclusions about the folly of their voting habits and political philosophy (I use that word “philosophy” very charitably).

                    They actually think it’s due to conservatives.  There could be one conservative white guy left on earth and left wing democrats would blame him before ever looking in the mirror.
Let’s face reality, we live in an economic trading zone where large swaths of people do not want the same society.

            I will not dispute that there was fraud – I am sure there was. But you are reasoning from the white middle class – now a minority. For the average flunkie whitey, not much has changed. Gas, sure. But the crap they eat (fast food) is still same price, the lives they lead (empty and meaningless) remain the same, and Hitler is still out there. People who have no ownership have nothing to lose. We are the ones who feel it, but we are the minority. Now, some libs may be feeling the pain, but just like the parents of mollie tibbets, they will sacrifice their own kids to adhere to the woke religion. Again, I think most people on our side have normalcy bias, and they are thinking of their network of friends and family. But I think you have blinders on just how much of the country is fucking retarded

        I was just able to look at some of the individual races.   The graphs are very telling.  The dems appear to have conducted fraud in exactly the same way they did in 2020.In many areas the voting machines “went down” and in many areas they “ran out of paper for the ballots.”   In other areas the “tabulation soft wear” did not work properly.    After the outages were “resolved’ :  Presto!!!   The dems in those races had the lead.    The spike is clearly visible in the graphs just like 2020.If elections seemed a waste of time before 2020, then in my mind this should remove all doubt as to their utility, at least in national elections.

            Large swathes of voters vote race and/or ethnicity. Illinois had to enact a law that if a candidate changed his/her name to appeal to a certain demographic, the ballot would also display the candidate’s previous name (search how Philip Spiwak became Shannon P. O’Malley.) Maxine Waters doesn’t even live in the district she “represents” Yet they keep voting for her. We let stupid/ignorant people in every demographic vote.

        In regards to Fetterman what the Democrats in Pennsylvania want is nothing more than a warm body to occupy a seat in the senate who will vote exactly the way way the party tells him to vote.Nothing more. After witnessing his his various attempts at public speaking surely the party would rather he never says a word in public. Just shut up and vote.

            They can find a normal person who does that. They can find someone who can comprehend the spoken word and respond in comprehensible English. They’ve done it countless times in the past 70 years. Bringing in Fetterman, to me, is simply forcing the peasants to go through a humiliation rite. Imagine watching him slur his way through a speech in a hoodie and gym shorts and say, “yep, that’s the one I want to rule over me.” Imagine actually putting up a sign in front of your house to publicly announce you support the brain damaged hobo. Imagine taking precious time out of your day to go and vote for him. No, this is just the elites demanding we debase ourselves while submitting to our rule. It’s not just humiliating but evil.

                The thing is its all about demoralization.The same mechanism is used in horror films where the protagonists appear to be out of danger by finally getting the car to start, or making it to the local town. The relief kicks in on the audience, then the guy in the skin mask pops up in the back seat, or it turns out the town is full of his relatives.Total demoralization works the same way. Give some hope then pull the rug to close off the exits in your face. Eventually people have little hope left and are helpless.And on that point and some of my earlier posts on the theater pretending to be a war, does no one find it odd that Russia has effectively surrendered the Kherson region on the same day as the US mid term rug pull and appears to be on the verge of agreeing to Ukraine’ terms for a peace deal.Its all about crushing the hope of any resistance to the globohomo.

                        The latter is 99.9% I would say.It has been clear to me for a while that its not real, and the deal was the splitting of the west from energy and creating a new western soviet to imprison their citizens away from the rest of the world,  and Russia got a couple of areas of Ukraine full of Russians and got to kick out the cultural poison locally.However, they had to be humiliated in part as well as a condition of the deal by giving up some territory that is now Russian.Its depressing but Putin also appears to be part of the reset scheme.

        Sad but true. I had no illusions, given where I live, but I just feel disappointed that there was no greater impact nationwide. South of the Mason-Dixon Line, the allegedly ignorant Scots-Irish and their Cajun and Coonarse allies know the score. They form square and coalesce against the “activists” and their bien-pensant white allies. OTOH, too many of us in the Midwest–including my fellow Dobrawolskis and O’Haras–lack that consciousness, and the results speak for themselves. Time to consider a voortrek. Capital gains taxes, I gather, will be the least of my worries.

        ” We are now required to pretend that a brain damaged hobo won the Pennsylvania Senate race.”Sure why not?  We are required to believe that a brain damaged geriatric who campaigned from his basement got he most votes in presidential history.  And some black/indian/whore/idiot is vice-president.“The reason this particularly race is key to the legitimacy question is that there is no answer that supports the democratic system.”That is true.  A new people have been elected both physically from across the border and mentally through the power of decades of degenerate brainwashing.“What kind of political system produces a brain damaged hobo and a Turkish carny as the two options?”A system where the politicians are pure actors/shills for the REAL power and now it’s completely obvious.The writing has been on the wall for a LONG TIME.The Left has long ago captured the institutions (seats of PERMANENT power) and showed they could unilaterally remove a sitting president who won 49 States back in the 70s.But the masses were still overwhelmingly white and had the ability rebound and put Reagan in with 49 state landslide wins.  That was when the Left decided “never again” and flung open the border.  They’ve reached critical mass on electing a new people, and can now do all the rigging they want.Give it a few more years, and Senator Frankenstein stroke Monster will look downright statesman-like to what is offered up!

        The key takeaway staring us in the face is that Soros has figured out Secretaries of State are the key post to control if you want to rig a state election.
Michigan is a good example. At one point Dixon was up on Whitmer by 5%. And then, as if by magic Whitmer pulls it out.
Now, go look at the WEF plant installed as Michigan’s SoS.
I rest my case.

            But all the Republican commentary unanimously agrees that the problems were Trump (who endorsed ~200 candidates and only ~180 of them won? I’ve read) and abortion (which barely scraped the top 10 in any issues poll). So the populists and Christians have to shut up and go away forever (again), and when Trump gets shot during his coming arrest—he’s going to try to grab the wheel again!—really it’s a relief.

        In 2020, the elites rolled out their new ruling motto, which is something like “we are in charge, screw you, you’re never getting a say again.” This year showed what they meant. I am supposed to believe after 2 years of total control with an economy in collapse and widespread dissatisfaction, people want more of the same? Same with Joe Biden being the most popular man to ever exist two years ago. It defies all reasoning. There seems to be only one rule for elections going forward – throw out the polling, the 538-style “models”, the rules of thumb about gas prices, even the coincidences about the Washington team. The new rule is “Democrats always win.” The polls are used to determine how many votes they need and they have them ready to go. The process seems significantly refined and much more widespread compared to 2020. The people who were central in the story in 2020, like Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, were rewarded for their loyalty. In 2024 their process is going to be even better. Republicans don’t have a chance going forward, even if we have hyperinflation, nuclear winter, and mandated drag queen class for 5 year olds.Yet, the message to the votecucks will be today “ahh, you just can’t win them all, the people spoke and choose to be ruled by this lumbering gargoyle and his gang of crooks and, by your participation in this process, so do you.” I am sure some grillers will just aw shucks and go back to the game on TV, but I wouldn’t be surprised if more and more people come to this side. After all, it’s just humiliating. I saw people congratulating the hobo on twitter and that they are all pretending that this vegetable is a legit statesman is just embarrassing. The entire thing is a complete farce, the elites know it and seem to want us to know it too. It’s completely over for this country.

        Pretty pleased with this result. Republicans are terrible and didn’t get rewarded just for being the junior partner of the seesaw arrangement.  The GOP is the bane of any American identitarian current. You can’t reform a party where you can count the amount of people sympathetic to you on one hand.
Hopefully Trump can wreak enough havoc in the GOP to prevent them from consolidating with the next Dubya like figure.

            The issue is surely no one really knows what the real voting numbers actually are. Talking about reward is meaningless unless one can trust the actual tallies.
There is no way to audit them and for all anyone knows 50% or more of the votes could be fake in many areas.
Who knows if the results even have a passing relationship with those actually cast by real people.

                Their method of cheating is perhaps more distressing than the mere cheating itself.
As far as I can tell, their methods taint the vote in a way that makes it nearly impossible to back the fraudulent ballots out of the vote total after the fact.

                    Geese, that’s what I hate about the argument regarding “proof” of cheating. You’ve basically institutionalized cheating at this point and have made it extremely difficult to surveil or audit. If someone on the right or left demands “proof” ask them to prove it didn’t happen.Its like asking a teacher to “prove” that her students were cheating when she is banned from the room during test taking, is not allowed video surveillance, cannot interview the students afterwards and cannot even compare tests by name. And the test is open book anyway! “Well, everyone got A+’s, but the Teacher has no proof of cheating. Until I see proof, I can’t say anyone cheated…”

                Of course that has always been the case with democracy. Only now, however, do we see endemic suspicion that the returns are not gibing with electoral reality. And that’s because the universal BS-detector is shrieking like a Dresden air raid siren.

        Fetterman had the “every man” quality that is what real ‘Muricahns want. What is an every man in 2022?  An obese brain damaged degenerate with a blackout tat in a Carhartt hoodie.  Especially one that lives in a converted gas station with communist Latina wife.  I’m sure a lot of people my age thought of the movie Dodgeball, with Fetterman representing the Vince Vaughn character and Oz representing the Ben Stiller character.In reality, they both work for Globo-Gym.  It was not a “true underdog story” but rather a contest to see which candidate will read scripts for the war machine that will eventually take us out in a bright flash.  Oz would have been as  detestable as Romney or any of the others.  F  him.For once the media will be right in saying that orange blob really was the big loser last night.  I respect Trump for the damage his did to the body politic in 2016-17.  No one else could have done it.  But watching him over the past year is like watching a bee that lost its stinger slowly die on the ground.   He had lightening in a bottle at one time, but now the electricity is gone, and he’s just left with a vapid mantra set to a bad action movie score.The biggest disappointment of the evening was how many pro-vax psychos were reelected (see Michigan c word) after destroying countless lives and careers.  It goes to show just how anti-freedom the country really is, as it continues to worship a system that is disintegrating around them.   The next Congress will have to deal with a bond market crisis and I can’t wait.

            It seems that we got carried away with Fetterman’s physical and physiological shortcomings, without emphasizing his Soros-ist ideology and his undistinguished tenure of mayor of Braddock, PA, the South Bronx-on-the-Monongahela. I understand that Oz wasn’t a compelling candidate, but had I lived in the land of my birth, I would have voted out of my hatred for Schumer, Durbin–and their bosses. Well, I’m glad I don’t live in the Keystone State, after all, I live in————oh, wait………

This. Covidianism is popular with possibly more than half the country and that half is largely White. The only short-term solution is to physically relocate to an area where that is not the case, although it may become the case.
Whites are the problem and their pets are a symptom. We need to accept this. Most never will change.

                Oregon, where I’m trapped, one of the whitest states, and one that suffered perhaps the worst Covidian tyranny (it’s a toss up between OR and CA) just voted to give the Governorship back to the Democrats (the current Democunt can’t run again because of term limits). They’ve also voted away their 2nd Amendment rights more or less completely now given that Measure 114 passed. The measure requires some vaguely specified State issued licence for all gun purchases and that you take some sort of “training course”. Of course, there’s no money to actually fund this stuff. Oh, it’s unconstitutional as hell and hopefully won’t even take effect once the injunctions are granted but that won’t keep the gun stores in business when they can’t sell any new guns.I hate these fuckers as much as they hate freedom, masculinity, logic, fossil fuels, and everything else that made them rich and free over the last 150 years. Oregon and the revolting, smug, tattooed, infantile, lazy, cowardly cunts who live here is the face of what’s left of the White race in the US and it makes me ashamed to call myself White these days. We absolutely MUST gather better White people together somehow.

        This gold, Z-man. Worthy of Cicero.“The main question out of this election is about the legitimacy. Should we believe that the brain damaged hobo was the people’s choice in Pennsylvania? This is a good bellwether for this election, because John Fetterman is as close as we have come to putting a horse in a Senate. His opponent is ridiculous by normal standards, but in comparison to Fetterman he is Cicero. We are now required to pretend that a brain damaged hobo won the Pennsylvania Senate race.“The reason this particularly race is key to the legitimacy question is that there is no answer that supports the democratic system. If everything was above board and the people did vote for a brain damaged hobo, then this is proof that the public should never be trusted with such decisions. The openness to voting for a brain damaged hobo should be a disqualification to voting. On the other hand, if the vote is rigged again, then there is no reason for people to bother voting.”

        In this day and age, all issues reduce to the economic. The economic question is the only true political question, and it is all the more effective for never being explicitly formulated by anybody. And when I say “economic,” I do not mean technocratic squabbling over interest rates and taxes, as people are wont to think. I mean that the crucial political issue involves competing visions about what economics is. On this there are two possible views.1. Economics is fiat and feelings.The role of government is wealth redistribution through social-democratic scrip. The fruits of production are to be used to control and mollify mobs and to hammer the populace, the demos, into objects of political expediency. This is the Bread and Circuses view, the paradigmatic view of modernity. We may also call it the view of The Management. It is coextensive with everything we often refer to as the Deep State.2. Economics is force and facts.The role of the government is to defend the lands, resources, and prerogatives that belong to the nation, and to enforce discipline and fairness in the cultivation of wealth. The fruits of production are to be reinvested in the people and the state. This is the perennial and aristocratic view, the paradigmatic view of traditional societies. Due to its intrinsic connection with the productive properties of land and soil, we may also call it the view of The Blood.The Democrats today are very emphatically the party of The Management. The Republicans, on the other hand, very ill at ease with representing The Blood, have acquiesced to being the other party of The Management. The Blood has nobody to speak for it, at least not in the West, but something of that attitude is represented on the world stage today by Russia, which accounts for the Uniparty’s hatred of it.The Blood is never really amenable to party politics, anyway. Democracy and republicanism were designed to serve the needs of The Management and to exclude The Blood as a forlorn relic. Any pivot away from The Management would mean, first and foremost, putting our own economic house in order, ceasing to run deficits and consume more than we produce. The very painful episode of sobering up from the age of fiat, is why nobody wants to undertake that task.

            Great post. I do quibble with the point about Republics. They, at least the American Republic, are about ownership of property, and thus The Blood. Because of the age of fiat, ownership is subservient if it exists at all. In the age of fiat lendership is what is key, and thus The Managers caretake on behalf of the lenders. It seems the lenders are in the catbird’s seat, but they are wholly dependent on The Management of the Fiat Regime.“The very painful episode of sobering up from the age of fiat, is why nobody wants to undertake that task.”Very well said. All of the other problems have been created to avoid that sobering pain. All of our complaints merely cover the oncoming roar of the inevitable reckoning.

            ID writes, “In this day and age, all issues reduce to the economic.”
Your statement may have some truth for people who aren’t wealthy but for wealthy people, controlling the culture for the benefit of your racial group becomes very important.  As the movie industry shows, wealthy people are willing to lose money to pump their degeneracy into the culture.
The “everything is about the money!” and “go woke, go broke!’ people cling to their economic explanations because they are too scared to really look at the world.

        Today, I reflect on the blessings of freedom. Specifically, the freedom to not vote in these ridiculous sham “elections,” because this one is the last one where you’ll have that sweet luxury. Oh, we’ll still have “elections” — lots and lots of “elections” — but they’ll be North Korea-style plebiscites: “Isn’t The Regime just great? Don’t you love Dear Leader with all your heart? Check yes or no.” I see people worrying that Biden is going to cancel the 2024 elections. Have no fear; voting is about to become mandatory, Australia-style. How else would The Regime know how much we love them, unless they force us to tell them every few years?

Exactly. Voting will become about as voluntary as paying federal income taxes. Australia fines a fairly insubstantial amount. Our Democracy will be much worse

        I think Fetterman probably legitimately won (not dismissing possibility of rigging). I bet half voters did not even know his speech, much less his brain, is addled. The media is the real victor in this race. The average American is so dumb, they will move whatever way the media tells them – just look at covid. Talk to an 18 year old outside of your network. Talk to twenty of them. I do not think most people realize how ignorant young folk are. They only know what social media tells them. They are the eloi, and their time has come. The morlocks are busy behind the scenes.

            I have had that luxury. Some of them are going to the most elite schools, and others are in solid top 100 schools. Not a single one of them knows how to think. I mean, even things we don’t think of as problem solving are issues. The ones going to top tier know how to posture and spout the cliches of Regime Cult Vernacular, but they are arrogant with zero intellectual curiosity. Why should they be curious? They know it all already. The past is bad, those who created it are evil. They are here to bury the past and create a morally perfect world.Then there is going around town and seeing all of these young boys who should be men by now who are Hunger Games style eunuchs. Degeneracy and demoralization.Lambs to slaughter. Unfortunately, they will lead more than themselves to slaughter. Get out of the big cities and their exurbs.

                Sad truth. My cohort of genZ overachievers are now sending their precious below-replacement spawn off to colleges. Not even “top” colleges. Just the bread n circus state variety.Many aren’t even worried about the education as much as maintaining the fiat status trajectory and being able to “experience college with their friends”.The other side of that coin being their own ability to talk about their kids’ college trajectories around the grill.And these are the right-wing ones who are super worked up about the steal and the “covid”. So much that they even talked to me a little about moving rural. You know, at some point soon. When the kids finish school, sell the business, save more money, vote harder again etc.Which leads me to my own exodus. Leaving the cities asap is prudent. But by no means does it solve much other than concentration risk and the vibrancy problems. Moving rural is like diversifying ones portfolio. Concentration risk is mitigated but your money is still in the same market.Those young boys in rags and ruin are everywhere here in the hills. Wiggers. Slouchy, frumpy, literally dirty soy males and borderline retarded freaks that would fit right in with their urban LGBTQWERTY clanswomyn.Speaking of. The girls aren’t much better. Mudsharking is rampant. Busted families are the norm. Beat looking strung out 40 y/o grandmothers shuffling through Dollar Gen. Chainsmoking and driving like crackheads on jugwine.Drugs are rampant. Crime is commonplace. The few achievers, meanwhile, are busy making hay in the sunny chaos.Ambitious white men are busy arbitraging illegal mexican or e. European ethnic non-English labor and milking Yankees and the desperate in every trade or dealing from drywall to firewood. Flipping houses, trucks, tractors, lawnmowers and anything not bolted to the carport. The seed corn is popping hot and being gobbled up all over red dirt.Local BSW developers and realtors are carving up family farms quicker than the hay can be hauled in. All while precisely none of all this Economy is going into our People. As evidenced by all these kids being indentured right into the shitshow like our silient and boomer parents did to us. But worse. Because at least we could see a future.We have no magic dirt either. We only have the communities we build up from scratch in the wasteland. It is no easy task and so far, very slow going. But that is the only mission that makes any sense. So, yes, get out of the city. But be prepared for what is out there. Globohomo, is after all, globo.

                As we discussed before, 98, 92, even 85 is a number that folk do not understand the basic ramifications of.  But we are seeing them unfold.
There is no reason that people of that ilk can not have meaningful and contributing lives, but forming decisions on public policy in a 1st world, technological society is not one of them.

                Once I realized this unpleasant but fundamental truth, I stopped being angry. I think it has always been this way. It’s why democracy always fails and the reason our founding fathers gave us a republic instead. The best way to ensure the survival of your people is to ensure that there are no foreign wolves inside your polity who will attempt to wrest possession of the control nodes of civilization away from your homegrown shepherds. Even homegrown wolves are preferable, because eventually they can be replaced homegrown shepherds.
open society = rule by foreign predators

                Frankly, just being people who read for entertainment puts us in a tiny minority.  Looking at Tik Tok and the youtube “shorts” clone really hammers in the sheer stupidity of the bulk of the country.  Not only do they have to rely on videos for information, but they can’t pay attention to anything that’s longer than 15 seconds.These people outnumber you and they vote.  The very concept of democratic elections is laughable in this regard.  No amount of trying to make an educated decision on your part is going to drown out the noise (technically bias in terms of information theory) of the giant horde of retards being herded by the media.  Or even worse, they’re likely being herded by those sub-verbal commercials where it’s just footage of a bunch of mixed-race young people having fun in the big city, so vote democrat and get your clot injections.  Brought to you by Pfizer.

        The turnout in PA puzzles me. Like I said last night, traffic was crazy. I had to wait in line to vote, and I saw new faces. Also, anecdotally, big numbers from a couple of districts. Turnout in my county was down big from ‘20, not terribly surprising since it’s a midterm. Up a few thousand from ‘18, up over 40% from ‘10, comparing senate races. IF my mental math is right, also quick scan of election results from the state site:https://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/Checked the headlines this morning, wondered how many more will now flee to FL, wondered if they’re being herded to a peninsula in the SE corner of the country for their Dunkirk moment 😆At least more people will realize there’s no political solution. Have a feeling, though, many will then conclude fleeing the country is the answer. Whatever. Losers lose, beatings continue until morale improves. Let the winnowing continue.

        “John Fetterman is as close as we have come to putting a horse in a Senate”.Horse or Fetterman?  If he’d had been around in Caligula’s day, it would’ve been a tough decision.
“The openness to voting for a brain damaged hobo should be a disqualification to voting. On the other hand, if the vote is rigged again, then there is no reason for people to bother voting”.
That is sound logic, for which the next logical step is:“Turn off, tune out and drop out of a system that has nothing to offer”.

            If I had voted yesterday and I had not been able to leave the field blank, I think I would have gone for Fetterman. As bad as Fetterman is, he’s not a Turkish Muslim living in New Jersey.  I already didn’t like him before I watched the debate. He’s a total centrist run of the mill cuck.At least Fetterman will be good for the entertainment value. God knows we all need a good laugh.  It will be difficult to outdo the Congressman (Hank Johnson) who though Guam was in danger of tipping over, but I think he can do it.

        The whole “don’t vote so you won’t validate the system” idea doesn’t work with open borders.  Not voting in 2020 allowed Biden to open the borders and bring in 5 million more POCs.  That number will increase dramatically in the next few years.  The muds from the south are the wild card, the game changer if you will.  They will make your invalidation of the system of the system invalid.  I realize Trump didn’t follow through with his promises, didnt build the wall, etc. but he at least , did not order his Border Patrol to ignore the laws they are supposed to enforce.

                All I know is that 5 million more illegal aliens crossed the border in the last 18 months.  10 million more will cross before the next election.  Maybe more.    More and more sub Saharan Africans are arriving now and that number  will continue to trend upwards.    If a wave of POCs from Africa is not apocalyptic ,I dont know what is.    Trump, despite his flaws and his tendency to not fulfill promises,  would have at least required ICE and the BP to stop the flood.

                    Illegals do provide cover for the fake, pre-printed ballots.
Those, we call “virtual” voters.
Nixon represented a surge of white voters voting for their interests; 49 states, and he was hatchet-jobbed out.
Reagan represented the last resurgence of white interests.  49 states,  we got the ’85 Amnesty with anchor babies and chain families.
A generation later, it’s too late to walk back the demographic tide.

            I haven’t heard any serious squawking or resistance from the stupid party through all the gate crashing the last few years. What makes you think giving them majority power will change anything.
Remember when Trump took office. Think real hard and try to remember how much the republicans helped him. None. Really can’t believe people like you can still believe the nonsense you adhere to.

            There’s that old saw again—“Trump didn’t build the wall”.  You’ve invalidated anything you’ve said with that whopper.  The wall under Trump was doubled in size.  He added 450 miles of new wall (give or take), but further he rebuilt the old wall of about 500 miles which had fallen into disrepair and was porous to IA’s.
Trump was deficient in many matters, but as to wall and IA prevention, he was the best we’ve had in decades.

                OK, so there was a point to vote? Vote for Trump because he built part of the wall and most importantly he didn’t have an official policy of enforcement stand down at the border.

                In late 2019 (calendar not fiscal year – three years in) the admin was forced to admit that the 78 miles of wall that had been built was replacement.https://tinyurl.com/ymesvjvxTBF, the Courts, the Uniparty and members of his own admin opposed him at every opportunity, but some of it’s on him. He signed no fewer than 12 spending bills w/o wall funding. Each time declaring he’d never do that again. He settled for DHS to change the definition of “new barrier” to include improvements (lighting or building roads accessing old barrier.) “Remain in Mexico” was more effective.https://tinyurl.com/y39sj925Even that only applied to  healthy adults from the Northern Triangle. Everybody else was waved through.

        “…either Oz lost because people thought he was just as ridiculous as Fetterman or partisanship has made elections in the state meaningless.”
Yep, we are seeing the same in AZ.  One votes for the party, the candidates and their “peculiarities” (read competency) are meaningless.  Problem is, unlike say the UK, we only permit two parties to have power.   Therefore, whether the Dem’s or Rep’s lose, the *Uniparty* wins and *Democracy* loses.  It’s every man for himself from here on.

        The results are an inevitable effect of demographic change. This is the huge elephant in the room, partly because it’s such a horrible and hopeless thing to confront. It’s not “White Liberals” fault (perhaps it is indirectly).The “fault” is the millions and millions of non-whites who vote Democrat at a 70-30 split, all the time, who have poured into the country over the decades. Their priorities are not the same as your priorities, and definitely are not what’s best for “America”. They have 2 goals: 1) open borders – bring in as many of their cousins / friends / group as possible and 2) welfare – hook into the welfare system and begin extracting money for themselves. That’s it. Dems are the better option all day long.So yes, it was a red wave – among Americans. The problem is that Americans are barely the majority, and nobody seems to be aware of this. Maybe there was some fraud, maybe not. But there is simply a huge chunk of the country that is completely alien to America, that most people don’t see or interact with beyond a superficial level. If you actually got to know that normal, quiet Indian family down the street with 12 people in their house you’d realize that there’s 12 Dem voters, no matter what.The results just don’t make sense for somebody living in 1980, which is why people resort to the fraud argument. For somebody living in 2022, and who actually goes out and about and OBSERVES the people surrounding us, the results make perfect sense.

            You perfectly articulate my sentiment. Despite the no doubt omnipresent “creative accounting,” the real lesson is the demographics of the country have so shifted that there is no hope of a true conservative movement that represents white interests. Too many whites are compromised, and the demographic shift mitigates any pro white movement (as if the gop really represented that anyway). I have said before that I do not think Biden will be replaced, and I stand by that now. Why would they? We are witnessing the ushering in of the new unitary system. 2016 was the last real election, either because of variety of choice or freedom from rigging, but that is now over. And please do not mark this as despair at losing – this is just confirmation of what I have long believed.To wit- your kids will be able to abort their babies in the 4th trimester [sic] and able to chop of their own dick at three years old. You will be forced to take your vaccines. And you better comply. Sigh….

            “ The results are an inevitable effect of demographic change. ”Yep, but let’s extend that observation a bit further.  The demographic change has produced a type of population *unsuited* for democracy.  A democracy can only work within a moral and educated population. Moral in that they share a Christian ethos and educated in that they have the intellect for sufficient knowledge to understand and apply democratic principles.  This was even a minority of the population of the Founders’ generation.Our Founders knew this at the time of the Revolution, but it was less of a concern because “universal” suffrage was not contemplated at the time.  Times have changed with the “ parties’ ” incessant need for more votes/power and the inevitable lessening of the Franchise requirements the Founders contemplated.We were warned of the evil of “parties” forming this new Republic and their inexorable destruction of democracy and polarization—and here we are.

                I completely agree, which is why I mention both the compromised (morally, ethically, and politically) whites and the dick chopping. My loss of faith in the people of this country leads me to my conclusions, and the election is simply confirmation. Again, I think people have no idea how dumb and immoral most (whites) are. I work in one of the whitest, most conservative, educated sections of the country. I work with hundreds of the nest and brightest young folk. And it is a scary world – they know nothing except climate change and racism are worse THAN HITLER!!!!! Not one even knew who fetterman is, much less his ailment. It is sad, but this country is sick.

I said nobody yet, they’re still *printing* votes.  🙂   She didn’t pick up on this.She replied and commented all morning on her *busy* day.  Shopping, getting nails done, etc.  See you later was her reply, I’ll be back before dinner.  Meanwhile I’m listening to the radio and commenting here.So I ask, “Who has the better grip on the situation?”  I am not so sure it’s me—for all my braggadocio.

            Counterpoint: lots of white people have moved to PA to retire. Fortune Magazine acknowledges as much:https://fortune.com/2022/11/01/top-ten-best-places-to-retire-in-the-united-states-florida-pennsylvania/
Thing is, it’s gotten more diverse at the same time. I think it’s because these people like cheap servants, just like they enjoyed cheap labor and stuff in their career years.
I wonder what will happen when they’re gone.

You saved me the trouble of having to type this all out.  Demographics are destiny.  There are simply not enough Americans who want to live in a free society anymore.  Sure the politicians are all scum, but their mindless sycophants with blue hair and pussy hats are to blame.

            Embrace the power of and. It was both massive demographic shift and fraud. For being a Canadian, you have a massive understanding of American politics and I enjoy your great comments on this site. But I think you should go back and look into the numerous ways several states have changed their voting laws on top of the perilously close races in many districts- this allows a few thousand votes here and there to very much swing entire states. Sadly, as has been pointed out, fraud will probably not even be necessary with the control of the population the regime enjoys coupled with millions of “new voters” and single women.

        In this post and on RamZPaul’s stream, Z Man expressed amazement that anyone could vote for the “brain damaged hobo,” Fetterman.  Z Man said that this outcome is “proof that the public should never be trusted with such decisions.”
I guess I see the Fetterman vote the way that I see my friends who voted for Biden:  they aren’t so much voting for the candidate but the team guiding the candidate.  And to prevent a GOP victory, which would move us one step closer to fascism.  (If only!)

            I think that is true, but it is an argument against democracy. If all these people are is a robot that beeps blue or red, then why bother having people in these races? Just have colored squares. It is another example of how the arguments in favor of democracy contradict the logic of democracy.

                Isn’t that what they are currently doing with Fetterman and Biden and the others.
It almost seems a shit test to see how bad a possible candidate can be before it even registers as being insane.
They do not appear to have hit anywhere near that point yet.

Agreed. If I lived in Pennsylvania, I would’ve stayed home, voted third party, or voted Fetterman for the lolz. If the GOP can’t put up a better candidate than an alien carpetbagging Romney, they deserve to lose.
Sure, liberal tears are sweet, but lately, I’ve found myself thirstier for GOP establishment tears. Screw those traitorous sh*tbags.

        Not to worry, Zman.  Trump will save everyone.  We’ll show them in 2024!  There will be a true red wave so enormous it will overwhelm their cheating.  Because the system is sound; it’s just a few bad actors who have subverted it.  We the people!  If we just got back to following the constitution, everything would work as intended.  And we need to turn back to God and normality.  Of course, my neighbor has a gay son and he and his boyfriend are just wonderful, creative people.  And my other neighbors are immigrants from India – very smart and hardworking people.

                That’s a great illustration of both the problem and the solution.  We have tools at our disposal; tools that even today’s infantilized populace can understand.  Stories like The Great Pumpkin are great examples.  Most American adults could recap the plot of that simple, children’s cartoon, but how many of them understand the moral of the story as you just explained it?   It should be a simple step to illustrate that their “vote harder” stance is akin to believing in the Great Pumpkin.  It’s the lines of communication that we lack.

            Perfect. The vexx cull is too slow. When I feel hateful for thinking that I just remember that all those described above, including most of my heritage brothers, would eat my lunch, take my business, abuse my children, and banish me from the NAKBGEZ for my racisms – either out of satanic inverted morality or cowardice to save their own steak dinner. “Don’t let them divide us!” they cry out as they watch their moral betters punish my wrongthink. That is, between SEC football games and televised bass fishing.

        “For the people hoping democracy lost the election, this is a good result. The exit polls show that over 75% of the vote was white”The key takeaway for me is the last full sentence there. Most Whites nationally are perfectly content with how things are. They are brainwashed to the point that diminished lifestyles and prospects do not bother them. Most “see no color.” Propaganda works and idiocy helps. I think there was very little cheating this time unlike 2020. There is no need for it.Those of us who think as we do are White Alabamans in 1961. Separate as much as possible and wait things out. Most Whites are permanently lost at this point.

        We in Canada are a few swirls ahead of you Yanks as we go down the political pooper.I don’t doubt the presence of shenannigans in the vote… but what stunned me as a younger man were the numbers of otherwise intelligent people that lose their minds in politics. My former hive mates would look you in the eye, and patiently explain why the mentally damaged hobo is a better choice than the semi-functional clown. They’d defend the trannies in you kids’ classrooms and the perverts in their bathrooms.I think most dissidents would be shocked at the sheer numbers of moronic stupid people that will see this election as an unexplainable statistical blip, and that the better people won in their respective areas.

            I’m not even sure that Canada is ahead in the toilet bowl contest anymore.
The birth rate of our people is probably higher in Canada now. Our country’s “low birth rate” is due to the low birth rate of the Asian immigrants and millions of Indian male students. We also have a much lower mixed-ethnicity marriage rate than the USA.
I guess at this point it is a question of if you prefer Pakistan or Brazil as your future.

        The shenanigans are not over, and God-willing the Ds will find a way to retain the House too. If so, even the most addled normie will come to see that the system is irrevocably broken and voting harder is a fools errand. This is the only possible “win” to be had in this election. Things have to get much worse before they can get better.And as they get worse, everyday people will get more stressed and pushed to the limit. Expect there to be more anger outbursts in public settings, including physical altercations, and a significant increase in homicide. If you live in a big city, keep your head on a swivel and CC if you can.Don’t allow anger to become whining, turn it into resolve and tangible action. Expect that like-minded persons will now start forming into mutual support groups (of wide-ranging motivation) and the Stasi to actively infiltrate them. A simmering war will now begin and hasten the collapse. Your main goal is the survive the collapse, assuming Brandon doesn’t start WW3 and the nukes fly.

            TomA:  There is NOTHING that will ever show Joe and Jane Normal that the design of the system itself is the problem.  Or that the universal franchise (and Joe and Jane Normal themselves) are not fit to vote on issues of importance.  Everything rests on those two basic assumptions – magic constitution and absolute civic equality.As far as things getting worse – of course they will.  And anyone organizing will be infiltrated.  The answer is separation from the system – educational, political, financial, social.  Most people aren’t willing to make such dramatic changes – or they cannot afford to – or their wives wouldn’t like it.  And besides, their daughter is in her senior year and she’s got a chance at multiple scholarships to great universities.  Sure, the country’s a mess, but it’s always been this way and somehow things always work out.We’re the exception to history and human nature, and don’t you forget it!

I expect adults to think and behave as adults – I adore reading fantasy and various sorts of fiction, but I never confuse it with reality.  And, as I have noted before, I expect no more from others than I do from myself.  “Live not by lies.”

Might I add simply, separation…*mentally*!  Practically all I’m hearing and now reading are thoughts from people who are “disappointed” in their expectations wrt the election.  Why?  Because you put faith in a miracle.  You still have vestiges of belief in a system that functionally disappeared years ago.
I must plead to this myself.  One day at a time.  One day at a time….  We are all recovering addicts here, some more along the road to recovery than others.

            The plan, as they’ve said out loud repeatedly, is for the House to refuse to seat members who are MAGA guys—”insurrectionists.” That’s why the Democrats funded some decent Republican candidates. The GOP wasn’t doing it.
The ratings failure of the Jan 6 tv show may have put the plan on hold, but I doubt it. Our rulers don’t do contingencies. Expect nonsense involving Trump-endorsed House winners in red states where the uniparty wants to test Republican loyalty/weakness.
I’d point out some specific races, but I literally can’t find non-paywalled election results anywhere. Nice internet.

        Maybe the political parties could actually run on issues the public likes – for example medicare for all, ending stupid wars, anti-corruption enforcement etc..
And if one of you thinks medicare for all is not popular, you need to get out of this corner of the internet and actually go talk to people.  And this includes you, Mr. Z-man.

            It is popular in your corner of the internet for sure, but it is highly unpopular with people in the Medicare system. Seniors will tolerate no threats to their healthcare system. It is one reason both parties have no interest in the issue. The other issue is that the people who promote Medicare for all give normal people the creeps. A bad salesman can kill even the bets product.

                    3g4me, according to the darwinists, you are descended from approximately 4.5 billion years’ of ancestors, who only in the last 500 million years came to resemble creatures with organic structures noticeably more complex than those of single-celled bacteria &amp; yeasts &amp; the like.Do you study genealogy at all?Ever spend any time walking around in the local church cemeteries?Ever wonder who those people were who are now buried in those cemeteries?Ever cross paths with any of their descendants who are still living?None of those folk had Medicare.Few of them even had doctors or midwives or blacksmith/barbers masquerading as surgeons or dentists.They just lived the lives they were given to live, and then they died.Life is for the living.Death is for the dead.Your only hope for immortality on this earth is to make &amp; give succor to &amp; comfort &amp; feed &amp; clothe &amp; edumakate as many babies as possible [or, in your case, grand-babies and great-grandbabies], and to try to encourage in them personalities &amp; outlooks which are as optimistic &amp; industrious as possible.Anything &amp; everything else is just a complete waste of your time.Concentrate all of your energy on the living, which is to say, on the YOUNG, and ignore Death.Death will come when it wants to, and there’s nothing you can do about it; furthermore, at that point, it’s your children’s turn to take control of matters, and your turn to exist Stage Left with whatever decorum and dignity you can summon in your final moments on this Earth.

                        Bourbon:  Agree completely.  And regret if any of my comments have ever given you reason to think otherwise.  There is a difference between ‘honoring’ one’s own parents (and even there ‘honor’ is not synonymous with ‘love’)  and insisting that all who age increase in wisdom.A society that prioritizes the old, ill, and infirm over its children has no future.  A people who are too selfish to bare and raise their own children will be replaced by others.  I care as little for the old farts who insist they drive until they’re 87 as I do for the alien children of AINO.  And all the purported Christians who proclaim their faith while breaking all ethical boundaries to extend physical life because they’re terrified of death.To everything there is a season . . .

                    I don’t wish to add to thread jacking and turning election disappointment to “Medicare for all” discussion.  But I will.  😉
Those who want such must understand that nothing is free and complete control of medical treatment always results in rationing of care (for dirt people).
If you are not old, you some day will be.  Nothing to me is more abhorrent than being put on a waiting list for, or worse denied, care—especially at my age where such comes into play.

                It used to be ‘VA system for all’ until they pretty much killed off the VA system with incompetence, etc.
“Medicare for all” is similar cherry picking as the system kinda sorta works as it’s filled with old White people who, while expensive to maintain, don’t waste people’s time and play by the rules.  Flooding the system with foreigners and other lay-abouts would kill it off as instead of medical professionals barely breaking even on the patients they would be sunk.  (The tell of course is that they don’t pitch “Medicaid for all”).

                The really big problem w/ Medicare is the fraud. A lot of it is foreign/ docs over-billing for services that were never provided on behalf of people in no position to advocate for themselves. Where I live the hospitals will send you to “rehab” once you’re not critical, regardless of your age. Those places should be investigated.

            Is it possible that “diversity” and mass immigration play a role in Medicaire for all as a no-touch issue.It is one thing if a people has a common culture and a common set of values. It is another if they think that . You throw on top of that a political party that is enacting race based preferences in medical care, welfare programs, pilot welfare programs, disaster recovery relief, lockdown loans, and the fact that those racial preferences put the people who have the money to fund them last. Why would anybody be enthusiastic about programs like that? Those programs require trust and unity to gain acceptance, yet we have division, strife and hostility. We have open and militant advocacy for racial preferences in every avenue of American life. We won’t be adopting programs that require high trust in this climate.Perhaps, this also explains the low turnout in a crisis year for the nation which one would think should prompt and motivate a lot of voting.

                    Calling it “medicare for all” instead of “medicaid for all” is such an obvious rhetorical mistake, they must have made it on purpose.
Medicare’s reputation is terrible. Medicaid’s is neutral. There are no “medicaid horror stories.” It didn’t let anyone’s grandma die or force her to go to Mexico to buy pills.

        “After all, elections pivot on the ability of people to change their minds from election to election.”
This is the key point. People don’t change religions, ffs. The Democrats in my neck of the woods, and I think also nationally, are not a party but a religion. So now the election here is like an election in Iraq: screeching Shiites out-voting ululating Sunnis. And we will get similar results as Iraq……

            As much as I hate to say it, overturning Roe really galvanized the religious fanatics on the left to vote.  Doesn’t mean it was the wrong thing to do, but it made the left go nuts and your squishy right-wingers say, “well, I hate abortion, but it seems a little EXTREME to overturn a 70’s SC decision.”
Like Z said though, it’s pretty much immaterial.  The problem is the system, and the system is democracy.

                I think widespread mail in voting has been an unmentioned factor in some of these races as well.  As much as demographic changes matter, the Democrats have done better with low info voters for decades.  They are more likely to vote if they can just send it in and not wait in line.  Of course, a society would have to be suicidal insane to think these people should be voting, but that’s the one we live in today.

                    The place to start with mail voting is the assumption that it is mostly fake. In cities, party workers go around and have people on the rolls sign ballots months in advance of the election. Those ballots are then filled out and mailed in over time. It is called ballot harvesting and it increasingly common. Florida was an outlier last night and they actively prohibit ballot harvesting. Go figure.

                        Right, you look at areas like the Somali section of Minneapolis and the voting rates should be close to zero.  The people don’t speak English and know nothing about our system of government and aren’t interested in it.  They are obviously handing over ballots to Democratic operatives to be cast for them or they are getting picked up out of the trash.

                        The DOJ tried to send people into Florida poling stations but DeSantis told them to GTFO. There was no reason for the feds to try this other than some mischief.
I sat out the election myself. There were some local elections but nothing I cared enough about to bother. Plus I just don’t give a damn about democracy or republican government anymore.

                        AZ prohibits ballot harvesting as well—and where did that get us in 2020, nowhere.  They allow ballots to be placed in unguarded collection boxes and those were stuffed.  The evidence abounds.  Folks have been indicted and plead guilty.  Yet, these boxes still remain.

                    Call me a nutter or a sore loser if you want, but I hate mail in ballots. Vote by mail is simply a scam pure and simple. Let me quote from a post of mine currently stuck in moderation at Steve Sailer’s blog:“ Not to sound too cheesy but remember when you were a kid and schoolteachers were trying to hammer in the importance of voting? They’d tell you how men fought and died for our right to vote etc etcIn a similar vein my local newspaper ran a cartoon on the op-ed page years ago.

Men have died believing their lives were a worthwhile sacrifice for voting but we “need vote by mail”? Tough sh-t.If you can’t beg, borrow or steal a ride to the polling station, and then stand or sit in your fat person scooter in line, then you shouldn’t vote in my opinion. Let the Democrats scream “Suppression!!”Show up in person, show ID, and vote on a paper ballot that will be hand counted. That’s a proper election IMO”

                        It has become a circular problem.  We can’t ban ballot harvesting until we win big in a state, like Florida.  But we can’t win a state that already has ballot harvesting, like PA.  PA might as well be CA as far as future prospects go.

                        My husband wanted to watch the returns last night, so we clicked around on YouTube to find some live coverage.  I think we were watching NBC when they did a sob story about a paralytic who breathed through a tube, who legally challenged the absence of mail-in voting because it violated his right to vote (supposedly he couldn’t do it any other way).I said that no one would face the hard fact that if mail-in (or online) voting enabled massive fraud, then shouldn’t a good citizen accept the sacrifice of his own vote for the common good?  It was the old Roman thing, about giving up something valuable for the greater good; I think democracy worked when that was an accepted thing. Who would dare ask this guy to forego his vote? The very idea is sacrilege today. He’d snarl that it was his RIGHT, and damn it, he was going to get it because he was entitled to it! (He even finished the segment by saying he would join in on any other lawsuits to disrupt bans on remote voting, because ‘He was going to keep fighting.’  An activist first and last.)

        I reluctantly voted. There’s enough people where I work that are earnest YT folk who believed in civic virtue. I fell for it. I should have seen it coming from a million miles away. We originally had the police chief from Detroit throwing his hat in the ring as a Republican. Then the firm that was hired by many politicians including him, was found to be corrupt and the candidates were declared ineligible. Funny that afterwards, he disappeared like a fart in the wind and did not stump for any candidate. Then during the primaries, we had a used car salesman who although seemed goofy, had a plan and some name recognition was blown out by someone named Tudor Dixon. I had voted yesterday straight R (knowing nothing about DiPerno, and Karamo as well as Dixon) and no on all proposals in MI. All the Rs lost and all proposals passed. So am I living a Seymor Skinner moment. Am I out of touch? Is the system rigged? Or are people dumb enough to vote for Gretch? At any rate, I am done with voting…

            The Ann Arbor and Detroit political machines are unstoppable.  After the flub in 2016 they put mechanisms in place to make sure it never happens again.
There are pockets of based people all over the state, far more than when I was younger, but we will never even convince a majority of people. Luckily, the little hat people have shown how effective you can be even as an extreme minority if you know how to play your cards.

                My impression is that the Detroit machine is so dominant they barely need to lift a finger in Grand Rapids, Flint, or Saginaw.
It looks like controlling the judiciary is the key to getting the best opposition disqualified.
Too bad about Tudor though. Despite her somewhat silly background she seemed like a halfway pleasant person.

        I figured this would happen. The scale of it is the only thing that shocks me.I think this “election” would disabuse normie of any notion that our elections are free and fair. In too many of these states, people can vote for days (early voting), register the same day, mail in their “ballot” and other shenanigans that ensure the usual suspects win every time. It’s rigged.And even if the usual BS wasn’t happening, demographics and the movement of people from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to places like Georgia and North Carolina and from California to Arizona and Nevada are putting these states under the control of alien rulers who care not a tinker’s cuss about the majority of the population who finds their depravity and issue positions abhorrent.But here’s something to consider: Any system that would give you the choice in Georgia (brain-damaged football player vs. whitey-hating Communist “preacher”) or Pennsylvania (Sling Blade stroke victim Frankenstein’s monster vs. carny trash Turk TV doctor) is not workable. Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding on supper and 50-plus one is not a rational basis for a system of governance.Things are about to get a LOT worse before they get better. But that’s fine. Hungry bellies drive revolution, but I think our system will collapse of its own rotting bloat before that’s even required.

            Collapse, probably.  But then the two wolves and a sheep come to play.  You and I are the “sheep”.  Sheep get sheared.  Desperate times require even more “sharing” of resources.  That’s you and me and any number of others commenting here—and it doesn’t help that you are White in a sea of Brown.  When the Dane Gelt to the Brown/Black masses dries up, we can expect them to help themselves.

            Before the election, I thought Kari Lake vs. Katie Hobbs would be a bellwether of cheating.  Lake is clearly a much more impressive candidate compared to Hobbs, plus recently held a double digit lead in the polls.  No doubt a stolen election.

                No enough info on theft yet, but regardless the process is broken.  I believe this observation to be “self-evident”—how could such a statement be made if the process was observably “bullet-proof”.
That’s what I keep driving at.  Of course, as widely commented upon here, there seems no way for the system to fix itself wrt voting process.  The only way to obtain the support to fix the process is for the process to fail the Dem’s.  In order for that to occur, the Rep’s would have to cheat better than the Dem’s.  🙁

        If you are a Pennsylvania resident (such as myself), what do you do? In my opinion, you just work on making your small town or suburb better in your own way. The local politics path has been trashed on routinely, but I don’t see why. Its an important component that you actually matter in.National politics is effectively over. State politics matters depending on which state you live in. Pennsylvania is mired by Philly’s sheer volume in vote representation, but its not hopeless. Even in New York, I was surprised at how close Zeldin got to winning.California is the only state in the union that is post-political. There is very little that can be done to fix it.

            What must be done? Work to organize locally and publicly boycott elections. If 20% of people publicly reject the system the system will collapse if it does not go through a massive overhaul. Ruling classes only respond when they feel threatened. The current system is designed to prevent them from being threatened. That means the only option is to boycott the system.

                I don’t know exactly when, but there will be a point where parts of the US are going to have to go through a “reform”, not a massive overhaul or revival of our country, but a reform just to keep the lights on. The path we are on is not sustainable.

                That does not happen plenty of places in Europe where the voting turnout is less than 50%.
I think Romania is down to 30% and it makes no difference.
What is the ratio where you expect this to manifest?

                Sorry, but not voting won’t do squat.  It wont change anyone’s mind.  It will simply lock in the the other side even more.  More people not voting means we will get D.C.  and Puerto Rico statehood.
For example, abortion. I am ambivalent on it but many here are opposed to it. Not voting for DJT means no Gorsuch, BK or ACB and no overturn of Roe v Wade.

        Capital pike just beeped seven times, I think he needs his diaper changed. I keep saying if Karen bass wins I’m leaving LA, I’m getting old and will be preyed upon soon, if Gavin Newsom wins the big one,I’m leaving the country, I’m getting old and will be preyed upon soon. My wife smiling from the kitchen says we can  always go to live with her people in Taiwan. I wash down a few relief factors with a good German beer, get under my Geezer sheets, lay my head on My Pillow and make plans to hit the range in the morning. We all know I’m not going anywhere. I wouldn’t miss this for the world. The ramzy Paul thing was entertaining last night.

            As a native Californian (fourth generation at that), I was packed up and moved out to The Great and Sovereign State of Tennessee thirty years ago. Hell, the whole extended family made the move. My mother is from Tennessee.The old man has begged some of his based friends to bail on California, but to no avail. They could sell their home for enough money to buy a nice safe piece of land and live happily ever after, but nooooooooo, they can’t wrap their heads around leaving. The red states are getting redder, and the blue states are getting bluer. Without the Northeast and the metro hellholes on the West Coast this would be a very different country, and it may very well become a very different country. Come on in, the waters fine.

Economics drives elections is old-think, true in the past but largely irrelevant now. Today, people vote their tribes. And that means most voters are not persuadable.

                I’m not sure anyone likes things as they are. I simply think whites have been funneled into three camps. One for each wing of the uniparty and one group that is dropping out. The big drop off in voting this election is what should inspire us. Lots of people are waking up this morning wondering what was the point of voting. That is what we want to see.

                    Seventy-five percent of the electorate was White and that speaks for itself. Yesterday likely is the whitest the electorate ever will be, too. Will there be more people like us who do not vote?Some, sure. But nothing, and I mean nothing, will dramatically increase who drops out of the system. I hope I am wrong there but sincerely doubt it.Things are about to get far, far worse. It probably will not matter as to how people respond. Some states and regions are not lost, and will resist, but we may be at the highwater mark of internal separation. We’ll see.

                    With all due respect, I still don’t see how an overall drop in participation from 30% to 25% will change anything.  TPTB would be perfectly happy not needing to spend all those millions on ballot harvesting.  I don’t see a new dissident party rising up from the ashes of the RINO party.  I agree voting is mostly useless, but don’t have an alternative path either.  Maybe dropping out of voting while also undermining the system every way we can could be useful, like a dissident Atlas Shrugged.  But I still don’t see any hope on the horizon.

            So a certain amount of what I labeled as demographics is what I’d call unpersuadables. Fetterman in PA illustrates that there is a large portion of the voting public that will vote D regardless who the candidate is. I suspect this not as much the case on the R side, though I know a *lot* of people in Georgia who held their nose and voted for Hershall Walker simply because he was R. (and to be fair, if I still lived in Georgia I would have too) So I suppose it goes both ways in concept, but in execution … there appear to be a lot more “always D” types by the day.

        given what all the polls were reporting as the top issues of the election, not even cnn agreed that holding the line was remotely possible. Was hopelessness the reason? The result in PA is reason enough now, Brazil was a fairly good bellwether as was the instalment of Sunak. The financial troll in canada quietly borrowed $500B (probably at ridiculous terms) to try to prop up the failing national bank AND secure her nomination to a seat in NATO.I’d like to attribute it all to the mental deficiency of the average voter but I’m not ready to, given the other major issues currently happening on the world stage. This result was essential to keep the other (collapsing?) narratives alive.The first hour of reporting was slightly optimistic, so, there’s that.HONK.

        I read Philadelphia went something line +65% Fetterman over Oz.  Some of the big city machines in these states are comical in how corrupt they are.In my home state, we have the stronghold of Detroit, but also Ann Arbor, whose residents worship black people while ensuring all of them stay out of their city and get packed into neighboring Ypsilanti.  A huge percentage of whites are insulated from their own bad ideas or are so cucked they think voting against their interests is virtuous.In the immortal words of Kent Brockman “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, democracy doesn’t work”  This was a funny tongue in cheek joke when it first aired 20 years ago, now many people will nod along.

I’d rather spend the time trying to figure out another income stream.
Though, speaking of fraud, there are some really good fake $20s circulating here based on what the fraught young clerk at the convenience store showed me last night.
These fake $20s were so good you have to putvthem down next to one from a Chase ATM and mark both with a special pen.

            Another nail in the coffin for cash.  They’ll use such to get us onto digital currency, like it or not.
Reminds me of a news blurb during the last redo of the Euro.  The rollout of the new bills was held in great secrecy and to be released to public at midnight on some day I forget.  These bills were said to be forgery bullet proof with all the latest technology included.  The report was that on that very day of first release—at I believe 2:00 a.m.—a phony 100 Euro bill was found on the seat of a train.  🙂

        Hell, the leftard demoncraps might as well just declare “democratic” dictatorship and be done with it.  If a s*** economy at the center of an otherwise circus tent freakshow can’t turn the tables, nothing evidently will.  Third world status is officially cemented into place.

        Polling is used to gauge the number of votes required.  States and locales that are controlled by the demons use a computer to count votes. At some point in the process they go in to ‘correct’ the vote total for their guy.  Thus the now common vote spike.  ‘Our democracy’ wins again.

            I noticed that as well.  In prior elections, the Rs would always go up big, and they could see how many “mail-in ballots” they needed to pump in at the 2:00 a.m.  Now they see a Kari Lake up 5% in the polls and they pump in X thousands of fake ballots right up front.  Same with Sling Blade in PA.

                This is the thing Dinesh D’Souza autists are too dense to realize about vote fraud— it’s  not coordinated centrally out of Supervillain HQ by Biden’s flunkies and bed nurses. Actual ballot chicanery is loose, off the cuff, improvisational, like jazz. They know which unopened not-yet-misplaced boxes came from which the ZIP codes and they riff on it like a John Coltrane solo.
