        Those in charge of US foreign policy are very feminine compared to past generations.  The group is mostly composed of women, low-T males, and fags.
Think of US foreign policy as a harpie shrew woman who keeps insulting and provoking her husband/boyfriend until he snaps and hits her.  Then she can run off telling everyone how the mean, bad guy hit her and go scorched earth on him.

            Yep. This is what happens when you have Jews, queers, and women in charge of your foreign policy.The White Men who controlled the U.S. in the 20th century — George Kennan (from whom I stole my pseudonym) Eisenhower, MacArthur, Marshall, etc. — may have been imperialists but they were intelligent, educated, and understood that their actions had consequences and their power had limits.Say what you will about a guy like George H.W. Bush but at least he was sober, rational, intelligent, patrician, and patriotic.I realize it is cliché to compare the decline of the U.S. to the decline of Rome over and over, but one really does feel like Cicero lamenting the slide from stoic republicanism into degenerate, perverted imperialism.If the U.S. is now an empire of fags, Zionists, cross-dressers and abortionists, it’s difficult to not root for the “enemy.” We already have a dementia patient in the White House, when he dies we are going to get a mulatto horse’s ass… we may as well have Incitatus as consul. We could do worse.

                I don’t know if I compare it to the decline of Rome as much as I would compare it to the breakup of the Soviet Union. The parallels are extremely eerie.

                    The difference is that the end-stage USSR was run by old guard party hacks and bureaucratic grifters, but not by degenerates, queers, trannies, women and Jews like the U.S.
I don’t recall any Soviet fags making videos of anal sex in the Politburo, like they did in the U.S. Senate just a few months ago. In terms of degeneracy we’re more like Rome:

That’s because Saint Joseph Djugashvili built a wall around the East, which wall, for more than four decades, protected the people of the East from (((the Mind Virus))).
Never misunderestimate the genius ofSaint Joseph Djugashvili.

                Blaming all of this on the neocons is just a paleocuck dodge that fools no one except the elderly and the stupid.Blaming all of this on the Jews is to forcethemto defendtheirown.  That goes for Ukraine and it goes for Gaza.Someone here used to have this neat line about not chasing the stick.But not throwing it either?I’m reminded of the Stonetoss cartoon with the guy waiting to be shot in the back of the head while wearing his Don’t Tread On Me shirt and worrying aloud about being as bad as the enemy.

                        Here’s my taxonomy of our most powerful enemies within our nation:•	J3ws whose loyalty is making our country most comfortable for j3ws. These people ensure that kids learn about the holocaust in kindergarten and that j3ws are exempt for anti-white practices. They see traditional whites as an existential threat. They incite non-whites to hate whites.•	J3ws whose loyalty is to protecting Israel. This group differs from the previous in that they want to crush the Palestinians with little concern for the political problems that this causes in our country. They see traditional whites as gullible cannon fodder.•	Whites and others who are incentivized or manipulated into supporting one of the two j3wish groups above. This includes almost all white Republicans.•	Utopian whites who are at war with reality. These are the ones whose loyalty is to world-transforming causes like feminism, transgenderism, or rolling back the industrial revolution.Did I leave anyone out?

            Curt Doolittle has written about the feminine nature of how the Abrahamic religions – and, in particular, the Jews – attack an enemy. It’s a very different method than NW Europeans, who use masculine lines of attack.
It’s all about subversion and exclusion and responsibility avoidance. Neocons act like teenage girls because that’s how they think. And the feminine attack strategy can be very successful – just look at the West – but it crashes against the rocks when the other side refuses to allow them into their society and builds their own groups.

                    Disagree with you in part, nobody. Citizen is talking about how the nonwhite breeder hindbrain works.
As Ostei said, “they’ve absorbed the moral system of their tormenters.”The danger of Abrahamic literature is that itcouldmake one a carrier of that emosocial hindbrain mindset.
Please remember, the religions are throwing darts in the dark, hoping to observe if this or that works, without knowing why. Without an engine diagram.
(This relates also to your brilliant comment on “nobody in Saudi Arabia wanting to do things a Muslim doesn’t want to do”, re societal morality. Kudos on that one.)

                I suppose the Muslims fall under the feminine attack rubric because of their love of suicide bombing?? I’m think that, in that case, it’s a matter of not having aircraft carriers and 2000 lb bombs to do their deeds. For the Jews (and those goyim who imitate them), yes I can see it. They very much prefer mindfuckery to overt violence.

            Lucius Sulla: “low-T males, and fags”Xman: “queers”Back in the day, when Steve Sailer was still readable, he used to posit that perhaps the s0d0mites were being driven by some sort of an hyper-testosterone; that perhaps thes0d0mitesbecame so h0rny mere missionary PIV intercourse no longer interested them.Kinda similar to the old meme about “Type-A” personalititties &amp; drinking too much caffeine.It’s certainly true that all the strapping youngs0d0mites are receiving anabolic steroid injections on a regular basis, in order to look like body builders.PRO-TIP: Anabolic steroids shrivel up your nads and send your sperm count directly to ZERO.

        The people in charge seem like lunatics or fanatics only if one assumes that their loyalty lies with the United States and Americans, rather than a smallish country in the Levant and a certain tribe that favor small hats. Once you understand where their loyalties lie, all their actions are entirely sensible. These people care not one whit for America or Americans, full stop.America is now nominally ruled by a illegitimate President with the mental capacity of a potato who was installed in a rigged, fraudulent election. In point of fact, a better way to think about the Biden regime is that it operates like a Regency, with Biden as the nominal ruler, but all the shots are called by members of the cabinet. A quick perusal of the Early Life section of the key cabinet members makes clear who is really in charge.There is a picture that went viral a couple years ago of Biden mumbling aimlessly to the press. Anthony Blinken and (I believe) Jake Sullivan are standing in the background giving each other the side-eye look of terror that Potato Joe will go off script. That picture tells a thousand words about who is really in charge.

        You just wonder how much more s*** the Russians will take – civilians and soldiers being killed, infrastructure being damaged or destroyed, and mostly by the good old USA, the most moral and benevolent country in the history of humanity – all while suffering zero consequences itself. The decades of no direct attack on the “homeland” are going to come to an end in a catastrophic fashion if these neocon tards aren’t dealt with.  It doesn’t look promising.

            One idea is for them to play kingmaker among the Mexican cartels to generate some chaos on both sides of the border.  With an effective civil war on both sides of it’s border, GAE’s ability to project power would be effectively neutered.

                    That’s just it, if they can find an unaligned cartel (or make one) and then give them extra spicey gear and intelligence to give them an edge it would be of benefit to them, at least in the short run.  The fact that they haven’t done it yet maybe means they don’t want their own ‘bin Laden’ issue in the future, or, quite possibly, I’m making it sound easier than it is.

            I don’t know much about Russia, but they have to be getting to the point where they realize it is time for Zelenskyyyyyyyyyyy and the Kiev regime to go. It’s interesting how, whenever these sort of people get some measure of power in some sort of conflict, terrorist attacks immediately follow. This has been true since the 19th century in Tsarist Russia, it was true in the Levant in the 20th century, it was true in Afghanistan, it was true in Iraq after Saddam was executed, it is true of ISIS, it is true of the Mexican cartels, so on and so on. So, these thugs are not going to stop killing civilians intentionally. This is just what they do and Russia has to know this.

            The future may well look like murky tit-for-tat “terrorist” events like spectacular one-off failures. A bridge here, a building collapse there, an airliner downing, a massive appearance of drugs into a medium sized city.  (By the time our press gets done “reporting” there is no telling what the truth is, but in general, one can pretty much bank on the US gov lying 100%)At this point, the empire is so dysfunctional that it isn’t clear how much damage might be the product of natural decline/decay and how much might be helped along by the Empire’s enemies getting funded to operate here.And that would be if we are lucky, as it would be a modality of conducting war that circumvents nuclear triggering.As Zman pointed out Nixon (in particular) fully recognized the crucial importance of equivalent institutions of Soviets and Americans being in close contact. It’s all been downhill since. Recall how several legacy system databases were easily hacked and government employee sensitive data released to the dark web while Obama was busy cornering Randy Weaver. The point is that even if Russia deliberately side-steps American nuclear trip wires, it still doesn’t guarantee that the Empire’s aging legacy systems won’t dysfunction.

        You gotta hand it to the Clown World propaganda apparatus, Putin = Hitler and there is nothing that can change the mind of anybody in the west about that. “Unprovoked” through repetition early and often, is the gospel.

            It’s easy to hate Putler when you don’t have skin in the game. I hope very much that if this stupid war gets NATO directly involved, and Western officials start talking conscription, then public support for Ukraine evaporates. After all, the biggest cheerleaders of the regime are Boomers and leftists, both of whom can’t fight well. People on the Right will be highly skeptical and many could refuse to fight, especially with the Dems in charge.

                I find it impossible to hate Putin because I don’t know anything about him.  The only things I know about Putin are Western talking points.  Talking points is the only way the Western press talks about him.  He supposedly jails and kills journalists. Good.  He was a KGB man.  OK.  George Bush ran the CIA. That didn’t make him Hitler. He kills/jails his political enemies. OK, if you say so.  He is a dictator with fake elections.
99.9% of the people exclaiming their hatred of Putin know about as much about him as I do.  It’s all fake and gay.

                    Israel jails and kills journalists and the American government helps cover it up for them in the media and the UN. America kills and jails its political enemies. America has fake elections. If Putin is a dictator, at least the Russians know who is in charge. We have no idea here. Really what this comes down is this entire frame of the morality of liberal democracy is totally fake and gay – everything that America accuses others of doing, it has done and is doing tenfold, and the only difference is that the guys with the most guns say that they are good and the other guys are bad.

                        Israel is rising in my esteem. Seriously, one thing about clownworld I hate so much is the pedestal “journalists” are put on (mostly by themselves) and how the law never applies to them. I especially despise the way they talk about themselves. There is no group of people who deserve to be in camps than “Journalists” and celebrities.
It’s one thing to be the mouthpiece of globohomo/AINO, but it’s another thing to heap praise on yourself for your alleged protecting the little people and defending freedom and democracy while doing so.

                            I hate the globohomo/AINO mouthpieces as much as anyone. Before you tip your cap to Israel’s behavior, though, remember that they are killing journalists who are actually on the ground, in a war zone, documenting its atrocities with the intent on reporting on them. This is why Israel kills them. They are not sitting in an air-conditioned office in Washington rewriting emails they got from the Pentagon before they go back to their $1.2 million home. It’s also not like the globohomo/AINO mouthpieces have any consideration or respect for the actual journalists – as we have seen in the Assange affair, for example, they loathe them just as much as any State Department or Pentagon stooge.

            The most recent polling data I could find, which is over a year old, showed that 21 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of Putin. This is twice the number of people who hold a favorable view of the US Congress. This is astounding, given the full court press of anti-Putin propaganda being dished up by the West.
Don’t give up on all your fellow citizens. At least twenty percent are free thinkers.

            The idea that “Putin is Hitler” is risibly absurd to anyone with even the most cursory knowledge of World War II.
Hillary Clinton actually said “Putin is like Hitler” when she was Secretary of State, for f–k’s sake:
Hillary Clinton says Putin’s actions are like ‘what Hitler did back in the ’30s’ – The Washington Post (archive.is)
What an utterly ignorant, stupid twat.

            Releasing Assange shows that they still care about the veneer of “democracy,” which this allows them to maintain. In spite of the fact that the mission was already accomplished – they have destroyed the man, and set the example.

                In the fullness of time, Assange will be a hero in the world of the press.  Perhaps a prestigious award will be named after him.
Whatever the press was in the past, it is now just the propaganda arm of the state staffed with the worst sorts of worms pretending to be people.

                At first, I figured Assange must be at death’s door and that wasn’t a great look. (Silly me).  But after hearing Greenwald’s explanation of Assange’s served time is exactly matched to the proposed sentence it might be a case of “Two birds, one stone”.Yes, the veneer of democracy bullshit must be maintained for the cheap seats in the back, and also Assange’s release is 99% risk management. They shuttled him straight back to Australia, avoiding any and all US legal processes on US soil (and all risk of opening his mouth during US election).Sickenly, as you say, all his peers (except a handful like Glenn Greenwald, Mate, etc) have fully absorbed the object lesson and faithfully bark the progressive police state’s scripts like the braindead believers they are, 24/7.Assange deserves “reparations” and Obama’s Nobel prize.

            From my brief reading, I’m wondering if the regime did release Assange.  Didn’t the current plea deal come after Britain finally refused to extradite Assange—citing their believe he would not get his rights in the *USA*?  Seems the current plea deal is a sop to save face for the GAE.  Assange took it of course as he has been wrongly imprisoned for seemingly forever now.  Sort of like Gitmo.

                Correct. They are supposed to give him jail time and then say that he already sat in prison long enough and release him. A “win-win”, sort of, and Assange will end up in the prison colony called Australia.

                The fact is, there is a lot of overlap between the anti-genocide Democrats and the release-Assange Democrats. This is a sop to them, but I don’t think it will work.I don’t blame Assange for taking the deal, I can’t imagine what he has been through at the hands of the evil GAE regime, but in the end, it’s disappointing that he was forced to plead guilty and has a little “I always loved Big Brother” feel to it. He was a journalist and not a citizen of the USA and had no obligation to keep evidence of American war crimes secret. But, as we have discussed many times, the law and civil rights exist at the discretion of the GAE these days.

We printed a lot of money and remember Trump’s tariffs? Assange and Snowden maybe some more unpopular things they want to stick Joe Biden with. Likewise, getting out of Afghanistan. I wouldn’t be surprised if we made a deal with the Taliban to leave everything there and Joe had to take the heat for it.
Who knows what’s going on anymore? It’s all very weird and seems orchestrated at the same time.

        It also doesn’t help that our military leaders are all true believers in the latest managerial fads such as sodomy and don’t really give a damn about fighting wars or making sure we can procure useful armaments. The Obama administration purged most of the actually competent officers O-5 and above that would be our generals and admirals now and kept the politically reliable lickspittles who’ll be more useless than tits on a boar hog if the balloon goes up.

            What Obama did was inevitable for a decadent, decaying empire in thrall to a ridiculous ideology. If it leads to a military collapse and loss of legitimacy for the empire, so be it. I would say, far from not helping, it puts us back on a path towards the Good, the Beautiful, and the True.

                Cluster munition, not FASCAM. CM not very useful against structures and they are designed to explode on impact.  FASCAM are atry-delivered minefields.  The munitions in this case looked like CM on video.

        Looking down from 10,000 feet isnt this kinda Trostsky’s revenge on Russia? The background of many in the neocon faction in the United States seems to be Trotsky.So Trotsky now 80 years later has his  fanatics in control of the foreign policy of the United States.

                Britain has never had a hatred  for Russia. Britain has beeen allied with Russia more times than it’s been an enemy.Russia was a useful power to draw off French or Prussian power and keep the Austrians and Ottomans honest.If Russia didn’t exist Britain would have to invent it. By the logic of 500 years of British/English foreign policy the UK should have sat out the Ukrainian war and watched an assertive Russia demostrate on the eastern marches of the European empire; an empire which openly calls for the eradication of the UK.It’s very Third World to blame your country’s faults on Britain-the Indians and Pakistanis do this all the time. The Indians even tried to blame their caste system on Blighty. “Our strengths are our own but  our weaknesses are the enemy’s.”Sad that the US is now heading down this path.

                    The Muscovy Company was Incorporated in 1555 to “explore” – read exploit, Russia.Unlike  India (that’s dot Indians to you) the looting of Russia never really worked  Why couldn’t the Russias just lie down, the Patels could?. Catherine the Great’s 1783 final removal of the Ottomans from Crimea and the settlement of the  wasteland’s that later became Ukraine established Russia as a Major Black sea power and was seen by Britain as a threat to their God given right to Eastern Mediterranean  dominance and thus to their Colonies in the East. (Including Cyprus, btw where the UK still has Sovereign territory airbases it’s using against the Yemeni.)France and Britain were contemplating a strike against Russia from Iraq (You do remember the Milotov-Ribbentrop pact, don’t you?) when Germany shocked them by launching its stab in the back.As an Englishman I know full well that Russia-phobia runs deep.

                The neocons background goes back to the Pale of Settlement, long predating Trotsky. Galicia has been the home of trouble-making assholes for  several hundred years.

            Theodore Beale (aka Vox Day) has written extensively about the ties the US neocons have to Trotsky. Yes, they are Trotskyites.
Looking back at the Reagan years, the amnesty for Russian Jews was far, far more damaging to the country than the amnesty for Cuban refugees. Who knew?

        A good example of managing a crisis was the Soviets shooting down Korean Airlines Flight 007, a passenger airliner, on Sept. 1, 1983. At first it seemed a provocation. U.S. right-wingers, led by the neocons as they just were moving up the power ladder, said Moscow was provoking us. Fortunately, the president was Reagan, not Biden. It soon turned out the plane had veered off course and the Russian pilot shot too fast. It was an accident. Armageddon averted.

        I think the form of retaliation that Putin would like to perform is through proxies, just as the US is using its Ukrainian proxy to attack Russia.  So, for example, Russian advisors with advanced anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles may already be assisting Hezbollah in Lebanon in preparation for the probable US attacks in conncection with the Israeli offensive.  The presence of such weapons will, at best, force the US Navy to operate from great distances and use stand-off weapons, or at worse, destroy aircraft and damage ships.  The US also has a number of bases in the Middle East or even Asia that are vulnerable to local militias.  This form of “escalation” is slow-acting but it does impose a cost on the neo-con crazies.  I think that Putin’s view is that time is on his side and avoiding a nuclear exchange is more important than the emotional satisfaction of immediate and direct retaliation.Another way that the Russians might escalate is to arrange for drug cartels in the US to have light anti-aircraft or anti-tank weapons.  Imagine the surprise for a US police agency to have its helicopter shot down or one of its light armored vehicles destroyed.Putin could, of course, unleash the ultimate weapon and bring down the EBT system for 72 hours!

            If a U.S. ship was damaged but not sunk, would the world ever know it?  Particularly with stand-off weapons and no enemy witnesses.When the Navy loses a ship to gross negligence from fire in the docks at San Diego (Bonhomme Richard), ships heavily damaged and sailors dead when the crash into each other or civilian ships, or subs run into sea mountains…it’s “oopsie daisy”.But the “invulnerability” of the US Navy, especially the carrier, must never, ever be questioned.The Russians aren’t going to shoot at, or allow their proxies to shoot at Navy ships. Because the Americans would go bat stuff insane.

                You’d think that eventually it would get out. Somebody from the crew would talk, sooner or later. This is the main reason I discount the hypothesis that TWA 800 was shot down by a naval missile. Not that I believe the official story either.

                The Houthis in Yemen have been shooting at US Navy ships for some time now.  They may have even hit one, or possibly a Royal Navy vessel.  I see no reason why Hezbollah would refrain from attacking US Navy vessels that are acting in support of Israeli ground and air attacks.

                The Black Exchange- the exchange for criminal hackers, worldwide- was located, oddly enough, in the Ukraine.
But…what if it were located ineasternUkraine, in the Russian-speaking areas?Surely they might have some opinions in regards to the US EBT system.

        “The system is now controlled by fanatics who lack second order thinking.”I also think civilians were deliberately targeted. I also think a moderate like Putin is the wrong man for the job now. If the US lunatics want to escalate, Russia should be willing to. But Russia under Putin is not. He is a most reluctant and diffident warrior. Words and threats only go so far and then it becomes like the boy who cried “Wolf!” — people stop taking the words and threats seriously.I think the nihilistic lunatics who are actually making the decisions in the Deep State have a death wish and will be fine with a nuclear armageddon.

            My read is the Russians still do not understand the problem. They think at some point the Europeans will tire of being American pawns. That is why they hesitate it escalate. They are thinking about after the war. They also have the relationships with China, Saudi Arabia, India and others to maintain. It benefits Russia to look like the reluctant warrior. That said, I see no evidence that the Russians understand who is running the empire. I find that astounding, given their love of history.

                Well, Putin bought into the whole Covid thing. So he’s probably the Russian version of a Boomer…in his mind, it’s always 1986, and he can’t grasp the changes in the American Empire since then. Neither can his lieutenants, obviously.
Trump is similar in that he seems wise to the overall situation at times, but then says something ridiculously out of touch. I guess this is what happens when you have 70-year-old alpha-male leaders.

They’re too old to change their minds, impervious to events, etc. They both regard America—not the actual state or people, always disappointing, but the great dream Other to real-world badness—as axiomatically good.

                What Putin understands is that the Kagans and AINO expect and want him to channel the spirit of Mustache Guy and respond to provocation by widening the war like OG MG in 1941, because MG had the emotional continence and strategic acumen of a toddler (like the entire contemporary State Department in AINO). Putin is the exact man for the moment.I have maintained that Putin is not playing the game like that. He wants to contain this round of war to a regional war against Ukraine, and not widen it to Western Europe. He wants to finish this war, and then prepare for the inevitable next war, not plunge into a world war with a declining AINO. Time is on his side, not the Kagans.

                Before this war can end, Russia will need to collapse NATO and expel American forces from everywhere east of the Rhein. This is straightforwardly obvious and should not even be controversial. The significant questions only begin to be askedafteryou’ve already accepted this as a datum.Now, either Russia understands this, or it doesn’t. If Russia does understand this, then the slow pace it has been taking with Ukraine is incredibly hard to justify. Yes, there was a case to be made in the early days of the war that Russia should not provoke NATO too much too soon, and that Russia should attempt to demonstrate to the world that it was not a bellicose blob attempting to absorb its neighbors and build an empire; but that ship has already sailed, and that particular case has grown quite stale. The West will continue to use Ukraine to launch terror-attacks into Russia for as long as there is a Ukraine, meaning that Russia is going to have to take the whole thing, whether they want it or not.It is long past time to bring the fight to Kiev, to destroy the Ukrainian government and to interdict weapons supplies into the country. This means also closing the Black Sea to all Western military. This will be a massive escalatory step, but failing to do so will simply allow the West to hang around Russia’s borders until they eventually get lucky, meaning all the past efforts would have been for nothing.The Russian populace is way ahead of the Kremlin on this and they are starting to get genuinely restive, wondering when Putin plans on finishing the job. If Putin does not want to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, he needs to make a move very soon.It is tempting to conclude that Russia simply doesn’t understand the situation, but that conclusion is not without its problems, either. If, after all this time, Russia still does not understand, then it is starting to look weak and buffoonish. That is not a look that’s going todiscouragethe West from further provocation. The writing is on the wall here: Russia must be more aggressive or the path ahead will be worse for it, not better. It’s time to “start something.”

                From that Putin interview with Tucker my guess is that Putin thinks the security agencies are in charge because that’s how he took power in Russia.  So the Russians don’t really understand the influence of Israel and the Neocohens, although they have enough knowledge to make sure their war propaganda is about “defeating Nazism” in order to try and disarm the (((Ukrainians))) crying out in pain as they strike.
It’s also likely that Russians in general have the same problem as the evangelicals here where they just can’t seem to figure out how much the Jews actually hate them.

                I think Putin does know. He’s on record as publicly stating in a value-free just the facts ma’am way that the Usual Suspects were more than just over-represented before, during, and after the Revolution. He’s on YouTube somewhere at a commemorative event for either the Moscow State Jewish Theatre (1919-48) or the Igor Moiseyev (yup) Ballet (1937-present) and in his remarks states directly that as soon as they got into power they set up their own state cultural institutions, as one does.He can’t come out and point the finger at the Eumenides for a few reasons: (a) justifiable worry about how this will be painted in the West where they control the media, and (b) he’s a bit hemmed in by the Russian Civic Religion aspects of the Great Patriotic War. ( c) You have to be a bit careful what you say about people with nukes.All that being said, it would be fun while it lasted if (say) Medvedev unleashed.

            My quick musing on this situation is to wonder if Russia might not take this incident to the UN. Address the technical situation and explain the requirement of heavy US involvement, then make a case for condemnation and future prevention through force of arms—like no fly zone over Black Sea.My thinking goes back to our invasion of Iraq in Gulf War II and our Sec of State harping over Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction which did not exist at the time. If nothing else, it makes for a good show. It might also tempt some of the big players to push back against the GAE.  Agreement by China and India for example.

                I agree. I would hope that he’s a Michael Corleone, who was looking for the strategically right moment to strike back at the Barzini-Tattaglia axis but I think he’s more of a Tom Hagen, who simply wanted to avoid fighting no matter what the provocation and escalation.

                I have to disagree with the impatient ones, because remember where Russia is at economically and militarily.
They are still in the building phase.  This is like urging India or Brazil to attack someone.
That’s precisely why Russia is being provoked at this moment, before they get stronger.

        It’s the same M.O. they use against Trump and his supporters; attack, provoke, riot, act crazy and unpredictable to put ‘the scare in you’ (witness the recent AOC and Bowman Bronx rally), break every rule, law, tradition, and just be as outrageous as possible, but if you dare to even criticize anything they do they want you absolutely ruined and of course, now you are Hitler, too.I think it stems from the ‘zero tolerance’ policies the last probably 35 years or more that kids have grown up under and we know who those adults were who made those rules: liberal teachers and administrators. These policies made it to where a kid, especially if a liberal pet, attacks or bullies another kid, especially if the bullied kid is not in the liberal pet category and they fight back both kids get the same punishment. Imagine what this policy does to kids growing up, especially kids who are responsible and don’t want to get in trouble, or what it does to those who don’t mind getting in trouble just to see you get in trouble too for fighting back. It rewards evil, imo.Anyway, the point is that now those who have grown-up under these policies and the oldster libs who promoted these policies see Russia and Trump as the ones who should take all their bullying and bullshit and just deal with it and manage it because they wouldn’t dare fight back or else they will ‘get in trouble’. It’s childish and there is no teacher around anymore and we are talking WW3 with nukes.

                Controlled opposition. All of the pro-Palestine protests funded by Soros are a ruse to unify the fractuous Tribals against a common threat.
The Negros have been used in this double-tongued way since Civil Rights.A late-night broadcaster in Chicago, ‘Clay’ somebody, used to take his listeners on annual cruises to Palestine. The FBI rat who flooded the hood with heroin and guns and created the fake, gay ‘movement’ called Nation of Islam, “Elijah Muhummid”, was actually Eli Wallace, a finkel from Brooklyn before his surgeries. (The ‘movement’ was a call to turn Mississippi into a breakaway African Islamic state.)

        “Thirty years of selecting for people good at enjoying the fruits of victory has left the managerial class in the West stocked with obsequious, narrow-minded dullards.”Well, we had a money-printing press and military dominance, so the Regime could operate without any feedback or fear, whether in foreign policy or in domestic spending/policy. But we’re getting to the point of consequences. The inflation is just round 1. The failure in Ukraine is round 2. You’d think it would sober them up. But it’s obviously going to take a major debacle to clean house.

        The system is now controlled by fanatics who lack second order thinking.This is the bottom line and why I have thought all along this will end in a nuclear catastrophe. These types exist always in every system but successful polities keep them at bay. The GAE did so for a very long time, but now is dominated by the psycopaths.The Russians will retaliate now. They have no other choice. Innocent Americans and Russians will die unless the revenge is extracted in such a way it terrifies the Ruling Class enough not to escalate but to excise the human cancers in their midst. It is doubtful that can be done as the American Ruling Class also is in the grip of madness. We have arrived at a point where a rational Hail Mary from Russia is the only way out without massive casualties and the destruction of civilization. I know what I expect and have made peace with it.

        “…so Russia is left to guess as to what is the real motivation behind these escalations.”I think this is easy and the Russians have figured it out, already.  They know with certainty two things:The US regime wants – actually, needs – a major war with Russia.The US public wants nothing to do with this.So the regime escalates using weird third party actors (Moscow massacre, Nordstream pipeline) or unfortunate “accidents” like at the beach.  They can’t be seen DOING these things as that would provoke the US public and the whole “we’re the good guys” narrative collapses if the public finds out.Knowing all of this, the Russians absorb it.  Their economy is now the world’s 4th largest.  They’ve decoupled wide swaths of their economy from Western monetary systems like credit cards.  They’ve seen some deaths, but nothing they can’t absorb.  This is a country that lost 25,000,000 people in WW2 in a world 1/4 as populous.Washington can only afford these little shows.  The whole “defending democracy” thing only works with the public if the public doesn’t see us masking large offensive attacks on Russia.It’s important to notice the regime’s code words: contractors, not boots on the ground.  F16’s, not pilots. Defending democracy, not canceled elections or arresting Ukrainian political dissidents.  Virtually no casualty numbers in a media that ran death counters throughout covid.Russia believes Washington is constrained by a pre-revolutionary public.  Washington ALSO knows this, which is why they’re working so hard to define “domestic terrorists” as guys like me (white, religious, educated, veterans who held or hold security clearances).And so Russia will continue to absorb these increasingly feckless and desperate acts of terrorism committed by Washington.  They’ll absorb it as they grind down Ukraine’s military until it collapses and Zelensky can no longer return to the country from his latest gabardine photo op.It’s 36-3 with 6 minutes to play in “garbage time” using a football analogy.Why is Russia showing restraint?Because they’re winning.They also likely believe the US elections are not Trump-proof.  So they have a good chance of waiting out President Poopypants and the neocon zealots controlling foreign policy.

        Russians think we are already in multipolar world, while the US led West is still guided by unipolar arrogance. In reality, we are somewhere in-between and most likely going towards full multipolarity.Unfortunately, both big players on the multipolar side, Russia and China, expressed their interest in multipolar world order under the leadership of the UN.

        Last week Putin open up North Korea.  Maybe the most amazing diplomatic coup in decades.  Then he visited Vietnam to get the whole gang back together.  I’ll bet Russian diplomacy settles the territorial disputes between China, India, and Vietnam where American escalation couldn’t.
He’s winning and will keep winning unless he takes the bait and gets pulled into WWIII.  They would still “win” for what it’s worth.

            The Biden administration rushed people to Vietnam after Putin went. Embarrassing. They do this kind of thing all the time. They do it with Trump too. If Trump visits somewhere they have to do a counter visit and it always falls flat.

        “Logically, there is no benefit to the West in escalation, but they keep escalating.”
They believe Putin’s gonna cuck.
Their logic says Putin = american cuckservative, and that he’ll cuck if you put pressure on him.
Reality is Russia’s gonna bomb the shit out of scandinavian and baltic countries till US leaves. That’s the future, that’s when Europe can start kicking migrants out.
Russians won’t start bombing Europe over Crimea, but they will when Nato launches missiles intoMoscow orSankt Petersburg.

        Serious question. At what point does the imminence of a nuclear war justify a real armed rebellion against DC (not the phony Stasi led Jan 6th variety)? If the rational component of the citizenry comes to believe that the corrupt idiots pulling Biden’s strings are Hellbent on killing us all via a nuke exchange with Russia, how does a civil interdiction happen, especially when time is of the essence? Shouldn’t there be a contingency plan for this eventuality? Is there a peaceful mechanism available that can stop them short of a hot confrontation? Perhaps a spontaneous flash mob of several million on mall could do it, but to be taken seriously, my guess is that they would have to be armed to the teeth also in case protesting alone proves inadequate. There aren’t enough LEOs and NGs to matter if millions show up. The spring is wound tight.

            The Covid Captivity, the stolen election, governmental sanction of BLM terrorism–all of these conjunctures justified overthrowing the government. If it becomes clear (perhaps it already is) the power structure is herding us into a thermonuclear abyss, that too would justify a revolution.
How to go about executing it, however, is idle talk. The vast majority of AINO’s subjects are so utterly oblivious and satiated by material largesse that they wouldn’t even think about lamppost solutions. These people will sit still for being cooked in a nuclear exchange rather than actually use all that ammo they’ve been stockpiling.

                Agreed. People only will respond to economic deprivation. It is why we cannot rule out a nuclear cull might be a feature rather than a bug for the Regime. I think the cavalier attitude is the result of insanity, hubris and stupidity, but a few million deaths might be more than a statistic for the lunatics.

                The Viet Cong prevailed, as did the Taliban, and now the Houti. Why can’t based Americans do likewise? The Stasi, HLS, and military are now substantially woke. And all the remaining good ones in those outfits are probably non-woke and will likely crossover if things really do go hot. I think all we’re missing is a spark.

                The American Right Wing is totally disorganized and temperamentally allergic and vaccinated against organizing. You can’t have an effective revolt or even meaningful political movement without organization, which starting from zero would take at least two decades to build.
This is why the most likely outcome in the next 10 years is left wing dictatorship, as the system will massively overreact to developing right wing organization and refuse internally driven reform.

            Just something I snipped off another page because to me this is another one of those existential topics where a lot of people want to go in the wrong direction:It utterly **depends** what you’re planning to do.Want to be a plumber or electrician or welder? Absolutely go to a trade school, you’ll make a fortune and you better get by your 50s before your body starts to bail.Want to be a doctor, nurse, lawyer, accountant, civil engineer? You damn well *better* to go to college, states require it for licensure.Want to work in corporate America? You *should* go to college. I can offer you $12,000 more in our initial offer, *regardless of what degree you got*. For our leadership positions, a degree is required… they’ll accommodate equivalent experience, but that usually means “he was a kickass software engineer who dropped out to ship a Top 100 iPhone app.”I write HR software. Employers can and do filter out applications where highest edu completed is HS. Some 78% of recruiters have minimum education set to 4 year degree and we have 1/2 million positions listed.﻿Don’t put yourself at a disadvantage for a company to pay you less, because they’ll use lack of a degree as an excuse. Or someone else who isn’t as good will have gone to school and gotten the damn piece of parchment and become your boss.

            Rowe was a professional ballet performer. Physically, he’s probably as fit and tight as a guitar string.
Both lads lookin’ pretty robust to this 65 year-old.  Neither is fat or loose, the core strength is still there.  (Mike Rowe of “Dirty Jobs” fame is the unshaven one.)And I double-damm guarantee you, they’ve both had a hella lot of adventures; no day is the same.

            Nick. Keeping your kids out of college is not a fad. Really. Yeah a lot of folk here talk big—and they are *not* entirely incorrect—but I think it’s really a matter of whether your kid and college are a good fit.A lot of kids and their parents think that a college education is an important step into adulthood, a golden ticket so to speak. It is not necessarily. There are already twice as many young folk in college/university as there is any reason to think belong there. I read awhile back somewhere that we are seeing students with IQ’s at 105 range (basically average) entering college. College was never meant to be remedial HS! Not to mention that we have, last I read, at least a 40% failure rate to complete a degree—thankfully most dropping out after their first year.What happens with lowered admissions standards is that young folk incur debt and obtain (faux) degrees in areas where there is no demand, e.g., Women’s Studies—when they could have spent their time and energy learning something that could provide a good future for obtaining the important things in life: home, spouse, family, self-subsistency, etc.Most everyone I met in college was working toward a strong degree to produce a good living. Yep, engineers, pre-med’s, pre-law, elementary Ed teaching, and the like. What’s the difference between them and a person learning a “trade”?Nothing. They were learning, or preparing for, a trade really—just a White collar one. So what?Come to think of it, I was perhaps the oddball in my crowd. I just loved the whole damn thing and never thought twice about what to do when I got too damn old to be a “professional student”.I had an old friend who employed me in his gas station as a young undergrad. We were having coffee one time years later as we regularly kept in touch. Out of the blue, he asked me how old I was. When I told him, he literally raised his voice and said, “What the hell’s the matter with you. You need to grow up and do something with your education!”This guy embarrassed me—and rightfully so! He had no education further than HS and worked all his life to get where he was. To him, I was way ahead of “the game” and was blessed with opportunity he never had—and there I was not doing shit with my life.I got serious and finished my “formal” education in a couple more years or so. My “informal” education has never stopped.

                I have no doubt whatsoever that, thanks in no small measure to the project to crowd out whites and flood the academy with wogs, over half of college students have IQs below 105.
Cultural diversity means diversity of intellect. As if it’s somehow beneficial to have a cohort of students with an IQ of 80 who can barely spell cat if you spot them the c and the t.

                    That’s just it.  Mediocrities bring the whole system down.Here’s how it happens, you know the process better than most.  A weak student is enrolled.  He may be a minority.  If a minority can’t make it in your college/department/class, you are scrutinized for bias.  Pressure is brought to bear as to why your college/department/class can’t pass/graduate these folk—are you a racist?You begin to change grading and standards to bring these people up to “expected” graduation/pass rates.  However, your teaching and testing is available to *all* enrolled students.  The good students are no longer challenged to do their best, as the standards have been lowered to accommodate those who should not be in the class in the first place.  Slowly, but surely, the discipline rigor declines and society suffers.Giving out degrees in faux disciplines is not particularly the problem.  Giving out “MD’s” to weak students however will prove fatal to their patients.

                        Right. Lowering standards to obtain a diverse student body is the tip of the iceberg. The pathology that drives staggered admissions suffuses the entirety of the college experience. If lowering standards in admissions is justified, so is lowering standards in grading and discipline. And this pernicious phenomenon permeates most of AINO’s society, by the by, not just academia.

                I don’t disagree with anything you said, but what I worry about is the naive people who might actually believe this crap and skip college for the wrong reasons. Friend of mine said this to me recently.
I think the whole idea comes from people who abhor physical work but run businesses that need laborers. Their kids will go to college but they want your kids to think about the trades so they can afford to send their kids to college.
Far out? Maybe, maybe not.

                    Perhaps, but given the laxness of admission standards and the tremendous rise in college attendance, I’d attribute most encouragement to the “golden ticket” myth.  Half the folk who go to college will never have as good a life as they would have had, had they explored alternative education for employment post HS—and that’s just those who graduate.  40% never do.
