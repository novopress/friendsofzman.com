        “The utter lack of regard for the people, the blind fidelity to a way of viewing the world, is always at the core of large scale human suffering”Very true, and of course, this was at the heart of Communism’s massive body count of between 60 – 100 million dead. Human beings were always just fodder for The Plan, and any setbacks were ascribed to “Wreckers”, “Traitors”, and “Capitalist Roaders”; to ascribe any blame to the ideology itself was totally out of bounds, which is why Communism could never really be reformed, only collapse. Since our own ruling class is essentially Marxist as well, we know what to expect.Reform is impossible, collapse inevitable. Prepare yourself, wait for the crash, pick up the pieces. And oh yeah, vote Trump. He can’t prevent the inevitable, but the landing will probably be softer for our people…

        There is nothing more frustrating than trying to rewire or do an end around on heuristics that evolved for a completely different set of circumstances.  In business, it is why companies fail.  Everyone just tries to do the same thing…only harder, but never see that the problem is new and “harder” is just a faster path to demise.

        In case you missed it, this is classic Brussels nonsense: “In a written statement to the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI): “The Government is committed to a free and open press and does not interfere with what the press does and does not publish, as long as the press abides by the law.” – The ECRI is a human rights body of the Council of Europe, composed of independent experts, which monitors problems of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, intolerance and racial discrimination.I feel so much better we have a group of ‘experts’ in this sort of thing. We certainly don’t want the average person on the street making decisions about what is or isn’t offensive.Meanwhile, back in Germany, Frau Petry is getting grief for her latest statement of comparing immigrants to a compost heap: “What should someone take from the whole ‘Germany is colorful’ campaign? A compost heap is also colorful,” The interior minister of Baden-Württemberg, Thomas Strobl, told FAZ [newspaper] that Petry’s statements were “repulsive” and “despicable”. He said “The strategy of these people [AfD] is to make people scared. Therefore we should not even get involved with them.” Strobl is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party.I would say if anyone’s going a good job of making people scared, it’s the exploding Mohamed’s.Okay. Enough stupidity for one evening. Everyone – back in the trenches!

        I cannot guess the motivations of those leaders from a century ago, but I am certain that the EU leadership of today is in it for themselves. They have found themselves in a position where they reap huge personal wealth simply by getting up in the morning (tax free, I might add), and little accountability or expectations, other than to move the EU project along. In this case, an entire culture and civilization is being sacrificed so a powerful and privileged few can afford vacation villas and wine cellars.

        Two notes on this.First, I am reading Barbara Tuchman’s excellent recounting of the buildup to, and the opening events, of the Great War, called appropriately ‘The Guns Of August.’ The book recounts splendidly the to-ing and fro-ing, the anxieties, the uncertainties and the blind ignorances as nation after nation readied for a war they all saw as inevitable. It is such a fascinating story that it would make a splendid TV series. My favourite part so far is the bit about the somewhat indifferent Belgian army of 1914 which would bear the brunt of the initial German assault and, according to the author, couldn’t march in step, didn’t like saluting and was run by people who had ordered heavy guns from Krupp in Germany but failed to ensure they would arrive in time. One may wonder why the Germans held those guns back…Second, as for the EU and Britain, it really is frustrating that despite voting clearly to leave we are still going to be subject to all the laws, fines, fees and any other crap that Brussels fling our way. It is costing us billions to ‘obey’ when we have voted not to obey at all, plus we now have to sacrifice yet more of our diminishing freedoms until our rather useless government starts the process of doing what the majority of people want in the UK.Fortunately, despite the best efforts of the Left, many of us are still informed which well-known Religion of Peace is behind so many atrocities, so we don’t need the media as such. Interesting to add by the way that Al-Beeb are determined to get more RoP people on our televisions and have started sacking white males to help bring ‘balance’ to our daily propaganda station. Ending well was never an option.

            Tuchman is entertaining, and generally accurate, but be careful – she was a moderate lefty, and sometimes she got a little…creative.

            I just finished Tuchman’s “The Proud Tower,” about the state of Europe immediately prior to World War II. It’s very illuminating. (And you’re right, Tuchman’s lefty bias shows through. But it’s still worth reading.) What struck me most about the book was her discussion of anarchist terrorism, a phenomenon which has been largely memory-holed, at least in popular history. I had heard of it in passing, of course, but was unaware of the sheer scale of the problem until reading Tuchman’s account. The anarchist terror threat actually had a lot of parallels to present-day Islamic terrorism, and had security officials pondering many of the same questions.Anarchist terrorism eventually just burned itself out; since it offered no hope of an afterlife, it eventually ran out of warm bodies willing to be martyrs. We’re unlikely to be so luck with the Muzzies. Still, learning about this factor, which current historians tend to downplay, allowed me to see things from a new perspective.

            Tuchman was pretty inaccurate on the lead up and causes of WW1. The best account I’ve seen is Stephen Kotkin’s biography of Stalin. Tim

                Edited: Short take is that no one sleepwalked into war, nor was it inexorable. It was chosen by leaders who believed it would be a short affair and offer them solutions to domestic or international problems. Fools, then as now, rule. Tim The first volume of Kotkins Stalin bio is a great read btw.

            Considering that Molenbeek, the most radicalized Islamist slum in Europe, is nestled right in the heart of Brussels, it would seem that that hope is a rather extreme example of wishful thinking.

        The EU has always been an illusion, premised as it is on the US and NATO providing for its security.  If Trump should win and NATO reconfigured or abolished, the Europeans will need to concoct their own security arrangements, which of necessity would require German rearmament (under the EU banner, of course, but rearmament just the same) on a scale commensurate with the defense of the European “homeland.”  This is a prospect that few Europeans have even considered, much less acquiesced to.

            I think it is more likely that EU without the british will come to some kind of agreement with Russia. Business community never warmed up to the idea of sanctions against Russia . The EU army (like the most of EU) is just a giant racket for defence companies. Sometimes the French get the upper hand and other times the germans. The benefits of having an EU army are the same ones US is having with NATO – one who controls it is going to be making the standards and the list of preferred companies for purchasing military kit.

                Yes, a German-Russian rapprochement is certainly a possibility, but whether the EU as it currently stands could accommodate such an arrangement is highly uncertain.  The former Soviet bloc states might have a qualm or two.

                    Chech republic and Slovakia are already on board . There is an article in today’s Financial Times explaining the recent changes in their posture. It’s behind a paywall so I cannot provide a link. Hungarians also have strong business ties with Russia . The Baltic states have no say in the matter . That leaves Poland.  True they are still having nightmares that the Russians are coming to get them. Are they going to defy the rest or will they be a good team players? Much will depend on the EU – Britain negotiations given that there are a lot of poles living and working there.

                        German industry is actively engaged with the old bloc countries; Poland, Czech, Croatia and Hungary are very active business partners. In fact many of the American companies that have started coming here to avoid paying US corporate taxes, are well established with these same countries. So it makes perfect sense from the globalist perspective, these countries will want to participate to ensure the economic benefits for their citizens.

        In an interesting twist, WWI was the violent end of the non-consensual multi-ethnic empire as a political structure in the West.  Today the cloud People are determined to re-create this very political structure in opposition to their own nations by importing what they evidently think (if they do think) will be other subject nations.  I guess they also think that it will work better this time since they are in charge.Then the claim to rule was based on heredity plus limited franchise parliamentary democracy (Even Russia had the State Duma, for a while.).  Today it is based on credentials + right-thinking (If you don’t at least pretend to think right you will not get the credentials) plus universal suffrage steered by fraud.  How long before we will see them try to limit the franchise to the credentialed (particularly if their long march is checked)_?Easy enough to construct their arguments in advance: Modern life is so complex that only the educated can be trusted to evaluate the issues properly.  That’s already the de facto attitude in Brussels.  Soon enough they’ll demand it be de jure.

        In 1918, the Germans tried to do what they should have done in 1914 / 15.   I have a feeling that by the end of this war, some Europeans will try doing what they should have been doing for the past few decades – keep the Muslims out / expel the ones already there.  After all,  they did just that from 732 until about a century ago.

        “history is the story of selfishness and stupidity”. I think the best meaning of the word “stupid” is: willful ignorance.  Our elites have become willfully ignorant in their pursuit of their selfish agendas. They HAVE TO  ignore reality because reality is overdue to correct their thievery.
I hope it will be like the french revolution, with  the selfish and stupid elites beheaded, unfortunately the young are so indoctrinated they will probably destroy factories, capitalists and farmers – then put (D)irtbag lawyers in charge. .

        Like all solutions to past mistakes . . .All government solutions are to past mistakes; that is, an attempt to make whatever it was work like it was supposed to work in the beginning. ( The danged unicorns and fairies never cooperate, and won’t come to work on Friday.) If clearheadedness, foresight, and a connection to reality was involved, it wouldn’t be government, would it?

        Regarding my comment about Putin and Brussels, I was referring to the worthless bureaucrats who continue with the stupid thinking that is addressed in this article.  The “esteemed” Council Against Racism and Intolerance has issued a diktat to Britain in an effort to censor the press regarding reporting of crimes perpetrated by Muslim terrorists, or Muslims in general.I had to search quite a bit to find the particulars of the so-called “recommendation”.  If you care to see what glorious work these pieces of excrement spend their days producing, check out their site at:https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/default_en.aspThe “Report” can be found athttp://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/european-anti-racist-org-calls-britain-censor-press

        There’s an article at Front Page Mag today that likens the EuroWeenie elite’s attitude and role with the moslum problem with the mayor and city council in the movie “Jaws” and their greed for tourist dollars powering their denial of the Great White shark in their waters.It’s an apt analogy.I still think Germany will lead the way in yet another European war, either by scaremongering with NATO about Russia (remember, Merkel is also fully behind the EU army plans now being formalized) or civil war(s) fostered by her suicidal open-door immigration policies.Damn right this will not end well.

            @ Fuel Filter – It’s funny you mention “Jaws”. I heard several colleagues at work today discussing a tragedy about another refugee boat that capsized in the Mediterranean. Someone made some comment that it was unfortunate the waters were not shark infested, as it would have been nature’s way of solving the problem. Cruel, but true.But to your point, we simply don’t have the military to start a war. Our military is no longer well trained, it’s too small and badly funded. We spend only 1.2% of GDP on defense and most of the military hardware we build is for export. From various German articles on the subject, it seems less than half our aircraft are operational and I question the readiness our pilots and aircrews given reduced flight hours. Our Bundeswehr has about 225 Leopard II tanks and again, funding for training is limited. Regular troop strength is around 166,000 and we ended mandatory conscription about 2-years ago.Since Germany still has the strongest economy, there’s talk that we should bear the brunt of funding and growing our military as a regional security measure. But as you can imagine, our neighbors are not thrilled by the idea. One must also realize that serving in the German military is generally looked down upon. With declining youth demographics and relatively good job opportunities, recruiting will be a significant challenge.However if things continue to polarize with European nationalism, and our economies take a turn for the worse, that could be a very different story. Our strongest partner would most likely be Russia given the economic advantage we could realize with them which would be mutually beneficial for both our countries. But from the military perspective, one must also consider the language problem between Germans and Russians in any type of joint operations.

                I remember when George Bush was invading Iraq a decade ago and liberals were ragging him for not bringing in more foreign allies. The impression I got is that there just weren’t many European countries capable of getting involved in a foreign campaign. The armies weren’t there for us to have as allies.

What you don’t think staffing the military with young energetic immigrant males who would love access to weapons and training and who have a history of solidarity would be a nice safe civilizing influence.  I mean it worked ok for the Romans didn’t it?

                In the UK a recent story was that finding school cadets for the army now involves trying to attract muslim kids. Indeed there was a picture of a schoolgirl in a hijab and camo gear at some kids’ military parade.So it is not just that the establishment here that looks down on our military, our military itself is trying to get everyone to look down on them by recruiting from among people who sometimes are determined to bring the west down.I mean, what could go possibly go wrong training some of these people to use weapons, explosives and fight?

        Z, you have truly nailed this one spot on!I really like your statement “They were wrong about most everything and they murdered 17 million people learning this lesson, not including what came next as a result of their errors.”The only edit I would offer is that because of their arrogance and stupidity, these people did not learn a damn thing.  They were responsible for the murder of so many by being so wrong.  Stupidity in the extreme.  And now their ancestors are repeating the same as if it was part of their DNA.  It needs to be excised, eradicated, burned, destroyed.When I hear someone like Putin threaten to take revenge on Muslims for any attack on Russia, I think his first target should be … Brussels.  Maybe we will get some new and more useful sprouts in the process. /sarc

            We seem to be running an imbalance between the kinds of new media required to disseminate information and the kinds of new media required to undo the cowardice and malaise of nigh a hundred years of programming. The young men who were convinced of the inevitability of fighting in the Great War may have had less information than we do, but I’m not convinced they had less agency. I hope I’m wrong.

        The monarchy of that time were the equivalent of the Cloud People of today, and the Russian Czar family in particular. They thought that the existing order is the only one possible, natural and perpetual, like gravity, and would go on forever and always.Instead, the tender-aged princesses ended up getting their introduction to sexuality from a rough version of Kama Sutra drawn on the walls of the outhouse they shared with their Red Guards in the period leading to their execution, and featuring their mother and Rasputin in the main roles. So much for the “gravity”.But the real tragedy was the annihilation of the society they were the formal and cultural caretakers of, and the end of something that took centuries and uncounted lives of the citizens to create.

                All these monarchies were united in their complete disregard for the lives of their subjects. The British Royals didn’t seem to have any problem with sending millions into the WWI grinder, even watching their mid-nobility sacrifice themselves there needlessly. They were all playing the same game of expansionism.Also, consider them wasting tens of thousands of troops to snuff out the Boers, only to abandon that project later on with what seemed like little remorse.Even today, how can they look upon what’s happening to their nation and think “Yep, everything is splendid, the country is on the right course!”. They are not saying anything to the contrary, do they?
