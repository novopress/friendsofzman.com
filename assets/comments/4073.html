        It’s hard to stay right of John F. Kennedy and still remain inside today’s Overton Window.

        And here I thought opposability was the the ability the touch the tip of one’s thumb to the tip of one’s pinky.You hit the nail on the head, Z-man.  There’s a reason why Neo-Platonism was the cool, hip philosophy throughout late antiquity, eclipsing Stoicism, Cynicism, and Epicureanism.  It gave the Roman ruling class the ability to babble to one another in a psuedo-intellectual manner without really saying anything and without really learning anything.  It created barriers to entry to outsiders.  Looking good absolutely and decisively trumped being good.Don’t believe me?  Go read one of the Neo-Platonist influenced gnostic gospels on the web.  If you can figure out what any of that crap means, then you are probably at home in the world of TED Talks, Malcolm Gladwell and David Brooks.

        The Bosslady ended her career as a grade school principal at an inner-city Cleveland elementary school.  She was adamant on the need to “see and be seen – and engaged”.Never felt the desire to be management after being a sgt in the USA – I made less money but stressed less also being the “technical expert” and managed to keep the “eltees” from self-destructing…

        UKer,  funny, my wife and I were just recently talking about the poorly run institution she is currently working for and she indicated the Principal, never visits the classrooms under her command.  Teachers exhibit all kinds of improper teaching or non-teaching methods / discipline / classroom management.  By not “managing by walking around”  the principal is unaware of the deficiencies and the faculty, students, taxpayers and society suffer from the neglect.  How rarely  one encounters a real manager of human resource.  Seems most managerial positions are filled via quota, agenda, nepotism or other non-qualifiers.

        A word about ‘managing by walking around’ as done by teachers. When I did my bit of teaching I would not profess in the slightest to be good at it, but surprisingly if you are in a room with thirty students (of varying but mostly limited intellectual capacity) you start to make all sorts of allowances and on-the-spot evaluations. I used to keep an eye out for the slackers but more so for those who were struggling to try and do something. They were worthy of help; the slackers could piss off as far as I was concerned because they had already made their choice to do nothing.I used to be manager once and managing by walking around was pretty valuable: not only did it show you were interested and concerned, etc, but also that you were still among the living. The same extended to teaching. Interestingly, adopting a position of power and authority was vital. I used to stand about four feet to one side of the whiteboard/screen if I could depending on the size of the room and about five feet out from the wall behind me. That became my ‘position of authority,’ from which I could see the class and they could see me. They also could see if I folded my arms that was my gesture of irritation at someone wasting time. Yes, I folded my arms a lot with some of them.
