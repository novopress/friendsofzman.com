        Offtopic, but the protesting near me is fucking hillarious.  It’s 100% (I’m not exaggerating) wealthy old boomers with expensive cars protesting “the elites”, while their Mexican slaves are busy mowing their lawns on a Saturday.

        I have learned one simple truth in my long life: the more we give thanks, the happier we are. We can never fully repay all those we are indebted to, but we can acknowledge what we owe them

        “The woke ideology has captured American atheism. . .” No surprise–atheism has been dominated by the Left for as long as I can remember. I used to frequent PZ Myers’ blog Pharyngula; it was billed as an atheist blog, but Myers and his regulars cared much more about people’s political orientation than about their religious beliefs. Leftist religious leaders drew praise, but Myers considered conservative and libertarian atheists to be an affront to atheism.

        Good for John Marshall (president of Colorado Mesa University) for allowing Jared Taylor to speak on campus. Marshall should have attended the lecture himself. He might have learned something.
It would be amusing to hear him try to rebut or “deconstruct” the self-evident truth of Taylor’s observations.

        Thanks for the longish quote from Ms. Shirver. Her comments meld well with those of Prof. Betz last week.I tend to the pessimistic so I side with Betz in his general observation that events are too far gone. Even if the UK abrogated all asylum and such treaties tomorrow, what great difference would it make? The barbarians have been let into the country by the millions; they aren’t going back to their awful cesspool nations out of the goodness of their hearts.An even thornier issue is the millions of native-born or naturalized citizens from those nations. They’re certainly not going to “repatriated” to a nation most of them probably have never even seen. What sane 2nd or 3rd generation ethnic Pakistani would return to his ancestors’ impoverished land?Related to Betz, I was surprised to see an opinion piece in Telegraph (Apr. 3) precisely on the topic of civil war and it mentions Betz’s interviews.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/04/03/civil-war-is-coming-to-britain/I fear the UK, the US and a whole lot of other nations have a very dismal, violent bloody future. It’s inevitable, and in large part it all can be laid to those mean nations (there were several) that prior to WW II refused entry to some poor lice-ridden people who eventually sailed back to Germany  They probably weren’t turned into soap or lampshades as hysterical propaganda would have one beleve, but surely they had dire fates.Well, it was mean to turn them away 85 years ago, so since then we’ve let in nearly all comers. Nobody thought it would eventually lead to societal breakdown. But it’s mean to talk about that too, it might hurt their feelings. So we’ll fine you or put you in prison if you write unkind words about those people.

            Assuredly, the future of America is bloody.  A war and a conflagration that dwarfs all others prior.
God is not pleased with Ms. America, to say the very least.

        When commentators first started going back and inventing the chains of causality that brought us Brexit &amp; Trump™, they’d often stop adding links when they arrived at “Atheism+.”That was the phenomenon/period of about fifteen years ago during which official atheism was taken over by women. Atheism isnerds, so it’s very weak to female attention, especially predatory BPD attention. Female attention is female control, in such a case, so atheism immediately “went woke,” as people would later say, and expelled or became repulsive to “gamer bros,” as some people call nerds, as if the problem with them is that they’re men.“Atheism+” prepared the ground for “Gamergate,” which grew into the broader “anti-SJW” fad, which becameloser class consciousness—and that’s what makes white men vote wrong, and makes civil war! now necessary, etc.—all the “white” stuff, white rage, white fragility, white everything. Thinking ofBrexit &amp; Trump™ asan internet meme that came to life, a failure of total information/disease control, is why the whole establishment’s reaction to it was (and still is; see theAdolescencething) censorship.The problem with nerds is that it might take them fifteen years to realize they’ve been kicked out of a party.

            Looks like the Regime is using ‘Adolescence’ to deepen its war against ‘incels’ . . . by which they mean any male not firmly under the control of women.
America is a feminist nation, and shoves it down the throats of the other nations of the world.

        No such thing as human rights. No authority exists that could grant them. If the globalists get their way, some day there might be such an authority, but, as of today, there isn’t one.

            First, not my downvote. But if a “right” needs to be granted by an authority, it’s not a right. It’s more a privilege, or maybe even a patent.
Rights are really nothing more or less than a society’s general acceptance that there is a hierarchy that should be used to resolve competing claims in a dispute. It’s not a guarantee that no one will ever violate that hierarchy, or try to impose his own (which is typical of earthly authorities, BTW) but rather that a moral society recognizes that doing so is wrong.

        Just a heads up, Derb.  You don’t pronounce mesa as mee-sa.  It’s may-sa.  I do realize American pronunciation can be tough on you (former) limeys at times…

            Derb also says LATIN-oh, instead of La-TEEN-oh. That is unforgiveable.

        04-07 More on Prof. Betz and the civil war that may or may not happen. Today’s link is fromThe Daily Skeptic, one of many UK outfits I peruse daily. The daily “News Roundup” is worth a glance, though it’ll quickly become evident that DS seems to source most but not all its material from theTelegraph. A refreshing exception today is this piece apparently written in-house:https://dailysceptic.org/2025/04/06/is-britain-really-lurching-towards-civil-war/It draws heavily on the Tim Stanley editorial of a few days past I shared earlier.Overall I get the gist that this is putting a happy face on Betz’s arguments, which you will note are all but absent in the Sallust article.I find it amusing that Sallust opens his article with a well-deserved swipe at the Climate Change lobby. Conservatives (which would be DS readership) take it as a given that “Climate Change” is a huge grift. UK are (literally) paying a high price for this foolishness, such as absurd electric rates. Beyond all doubt, “Green” cronies are profiting to the tune of trillions of dollars. But I call “false compare” comparing the Green Scheme to Prof. Betz’s warnings. Yes, Betz may be a bearer of bad tidings. But conspicuously absent is any apparentprofit motive. Betz likely isn’t getting paid to be interviewed by obscure outlets. Nor are his handful of dry, academic books liable to become bestsellers. This doesn’t mean his ideas are valid of course, but in my book the lack of obvious profit motive greatly improves his credibility, at least with me. This is not some lunatic on a street corner warning us of the aliens from another world, nor a shallow anti-Semite on some discredited dark alley of the web reputing the age-old fictions about Jewish plots, or what have. No, what we have in Dr. Betz is a professor in a sedate academic specialty that coolly explains some downright frightening implications for societal breakdown.
