        Iran has a history of Western-style culture, back in the days before the Ayatollahs, so it’s not entirely valid to toss the Persians in with the Arabs. And the Arabs have their own Borg, Islam, which they are only oh-so-willing to impose on everyone else. Not share, but impose, oftentimes by the sword.

        Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom. Soren KierkegaardThe poor Iranians can’t stand the thought of freedom so they’ll chose death. Very rational. We could get them on board if only we could find a way to get antidepressants into their drinking water. Big Pharma always wins.

        Yes, they know they can not assimilate into the Borg..  The power elite in the muslim arab world would lose control.  The theocracy/dictatorship maintains control by dictating terms of life for the collective. That control becomes absolute as march for ever increasing fatwas continues.  How are you gonna keep ’em  down on the farm,  as the saying goes, once they have  washed a barbecue sandwich down with a Budweiser, while watching scantily clad girls at the beach.

        I’m happy for any success for the Ramones, sadly unheralded during their long career.
