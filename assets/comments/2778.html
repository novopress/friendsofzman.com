        It’s shocking that some black athletes are recently being called to task for their actions. It has generally been more of a Rotherham situation, where the media/pols pretend all White men evil — everybody else poor innocent victims that couldn’t possibly do anyone wrong.

        “He appears to be contrite after the fact so he must know what he is doing is wrong”Or he is afraid it will push him farther down the rankings in the NFL draft and cost him a bundle of money.  The big money is in the first two rounds.  Don’t want to drop too far down.OMG, he shouted obscenities! As if no other FSU student has a foul mouth.  He and every other FSU student probably listens to hip hop music every day.  Hip hop is full of obscenities.  It’s full of rants against women. Is FSU going to ban hip hop from campus? Don’t think so.When are these scandals going to hit some white guys instead of all these black guys?  C’mon, sports fans, you’re not trying hard enough.  The War on Men has to be color blind.

        “Fisher said. “You can’t make certain statements that are derogatory or inflammatory to any person, race or gender.”Really?I beg to differ.Maybe the “coach” might confer with less of his “humanities” peers, and more with his “Constitutional” peers.Ideally, asking the incoming freshman class for their “interpretation” of what they’ve learned so far about the Constitution BEFORE they are handed the “official” campus handbook, and BEFORE their first tuition check is remitted?
