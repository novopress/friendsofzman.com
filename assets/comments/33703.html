        Gilbert Doctorow, re criticism of Donald Trump’s first month in office:“That type of criticism and kind of ad hominem argument is not acceptable. It is a polite form of slander. Donald Trump is often seen by many, many people in the States, and abroad, as a buffoon, a superficial person, someone who really isn’t capable of serious politics. He’s a businessman. He’s looking for his personal interest in this or that deal.This is nonsense. In the last three weeks, we have seen Trump perform as one of the most skilled geopolitical actors on the face of the earth. He has been choreographing, or his people have choreographed for him the appearances of his most important and most capable assistants, like Rubio, like Witkoff, Hegseth.”A New World Order is being born, and Trump is the midwife.

            It looks like the media is already making up the poll numbers to try to claim he is “underwater” and “slipping.” None of the articles that talk about this explain how his approval ratings are tanking even though Americans support DOGE, support the way he treated the surly dwarf, loved his SOTU speech, support his border and immigration actions, etc. The media is trying to tell us that Americans support what he is doing and rate his presidency negatively. How stupid do you have to be to believe this?

                I think it’s psychosis much more than stupidity, genes that could result in that level of stupidity would almost certainly be lethal in gestation.
On that Memeorandum site, they have an article from the NYT “Trump’s Policies Have Shaken a Once-Solid Economic Outlook”.The kooks still think they can sell the idea that Bidenomics was working great, 6 months after Trump gets put in largely as the result of Bidenomics. True detachment from reality

                    True but Trump’s ultimate success will depend on economics more than any foreign policy triumphs. By success I mean a shifting of the GOP to Trump’s outlook and a successor who will continue his approach. It is always the economy that voters pay most attention to. What is going on with the economy now will not count much. What is going on three years from now will.

                    “They just can’t help themselves.”
It’s like the old cautionary tale of the frog and the scorpion. The media talking heads are liars by their very nature. So you are absolutely right: They can’t help it.

                When the truth does not serve your purpose, lie.  MSM 101.  There are plenty of people who no longer know the difference, but do prefer a sweet lie to a harsh truth.And that’s not even a slight solely against the hard Left.  It is a human insight.  Many in the “Right” column are also guilty.  The truth is overwhelmingly that— whereas Trump shows “great” promise in his first days in office—his ultimate accomplishments will/must be judged in a longer timeframe than a couple of months.  Hard days lie ahead.  Human nature dictates that those who are now his die hard supporters may shortly be his die hard detractors.I remember the last “great” president to don the mantle in hard times, Reagan.  The country’s economy was in great peril vis a vis a decade of profligate spending and the ensuing inflation (stagflation to boot).  Indeed, in his first 6 months, Reagan tanked the economy and inflation had declined only to 10% a year after he took office.  (My first home loan had a 13% interest rate during that time.)  It was not until 1983 when the inflation rate returned to 3+%—and of course, we all remember Reagan’s stunning re-election victory on a campaign simply themed, “It’s morning in America again”.  He needed to say nothing other.Time will tell, but we are no longer a people who in general have a “high time preference”, but rather demographic change has produced a population with generally a “short time preference”.  A condition of human behavior antithetical to Western economic growth and success.Demographics, all is demographics…

                    Many white people, certainly not all, are a disadvantage because we instinctively dislike lying and it’s hard for us to imagine that others would lie so easily without shame.  We’re forever being surprised.
Our love of truth is probably the reason that we developed science but it puts us at a serious disadvantage in a world of shameless liars.

                        Yes, definitely so.  Which is the reason that I continue to support Trump.  He is so contradictory to my internal values set—which have gotten me nowhere—that I’m second guessing them everyday.  I voted the old fashioned, White way, all my life.  Let’s see what a “valueless” White authoritarian can do.  Can it be worse?  Doubtful, only quicker—and my days are numbered.

Anti-Semitism – like racism – is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to history’s most deadly plagues,” said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. “In recent years, the censorship and false narratives of woke cancel culture have transformed our great universities into greenhouses for this deadly and virulent pestilence.

                    The enemy of your enemy is not always your friend—yeah, a Jew said that recently. I rarely comment in this area, but when I see protests in the streets where the main contingent of the protestors are “Islamic”, I say a pox on both their houses.

                For now, we have to accept that MIGA isn’t going away. The question is whether we can move forward on other fronts. We can circle back to Israel later.

                    But look how far we’ve come. The voices are getting louder and more frequent. We’re tired of that little postage stamp country.
All I ask for is not to have to hear about that stupid little country numerous times a day every single day of my life.
Let’s have a week of Israel free media. Then, like alcoholics, we can do the one day at a time thing. Maybe 2 weeks without hearing about them, then, a month, 6 months … And maybe one day we can forget about them completely.

                        The ability to talk about the Israeli lobby is remarkable and, I hope, be the first step in a long fight to get some balance. Jews won’t ever quit, but we can contain them. This is a start.

                        I’m not optimistic. I’m assuming Jews will hold a grip over Congress for a long time to come. I don’t like it. In fact, I hate it. But we’re moving forward on other fronts, so I’ll enjoy those victories.That said, the country at least now talks about the Israeli lobby and its power. That’s a huge change. Acknowledging the problem is the first step in solving it.There’s also the issue that Jews seem to have figured – finally – that importing a ton of brown people who hate them isn’t exactly “good for the Jews” so Jews aren’t standing in our way as much as the past. They still think we’re the real enemy, but they don’t trust their mercenaries anymore.

                    Col. Macgregor is reporting that Egypt has positioned tanks as near as they can get to Israel. Doesn’t disclose the number of tanks but says point blank that the rulers of the Arab world (and Turkey) are facing a real problem b/c they know that they are likely to be removed–unpleasantly–by their own populations, who are furious at their non-response to the genocide in Gaza unless they get off their fannies and take decisive action SOON. And now Netanyahu has cut off ALL humanitarian supplies AND all electricity in Gaza, so a potentially disastrous situation for Israel is developing rapidly. Col. Mac also says that the Arab states are to hold a summit meeting later this month on the subject of Israel and Gaza, and he says that he doesn’t see how a general war–including Iran as a combatant–can be avoided.If he is right, will Trump and Rubio and the treacherous liar Hegseth drag us into it? And if they do, will Americans obey and go off to another mid-east war–this time a *real* one with potentially catastrophic consequences? Did the people vote for another war? Did Trump promise no more war?

                            The animosity of the Arab States toward the Palestinians cannot be overestimated.  No place the Palestinians have resettled (in Arab lands) have they not made themselves unwelcome and proved subversive.  Such is their history.  The build up of forces on the border with Israel is more likely a trip wire should Palestinians be driven out across the Egyptian border.  That indeed would be worth a fight.  Palestinians are a cancer to the Arab States.

                    I made the call a few months after Oct. 7 and the reaction of the Dems and their brown horde that Trump’s odds of winning just went way up. As much as Jews feel as though they belong on Team Victim, they realized that they couldn’t trust the brown horde on Israel and Gaza, so they had to get the Republicans – who are disgustingly pro-Israel – back into power.

                Keep in mind how that came out. When Trump floated the plan for turning Gaza into Atlantic City, Bibi had no choice but to say he was in support of it. And was summarily dressed down with essentially, “I don’t give a damn what you think. You are part of the problem. No go back to the kid’s table, sit down and shut up!”The Arab League said they would fund the rebuilding, but Gaza must not become an American Territory. Compare to the gambit he tried is first term, saying he would get Mexico to pay for the wall.I swear, anti-Zionists can be even more tone-deaf than Democrats during the SotU.

Well let’s take at glance at “Catholic” Marco Rubio’s relationship with not-so-catholic (((Norman Braman)))…
“Braman’s parents wereJewishimmigrants from Europe.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Braman#Early_life_and_education
Now let’s take a glance at“Catholic” Marco Rubio’s financial backers…

That’s a picture of a Crypto-Sephardic Jew shaking hands with a Khazarian Jew, laughing uproariously as they pull the wool over the eyes of the idiot goyim.

                        The stars on the dress was dumb. However, through Spain there are lines of people who show up to Catholic sacraments and keep their Jewish identity. Not all the Jews left Spain after she was reconquered. They showed up at Mass and kept remembering they were Jews in private.  They are called “marranos” by the Spanish. The first statement about being descended from marrano lines is possible. The picture proves that the sort of discussion devolves quickly into idiocy.

I think this is a key point. As good as Trump is, I doubt all of this genius is coming from him. He’s got the right instincts and the pushy personality to make sure things get done, but other people are doing all the grunt work.

                Precisely. I’ve been saying since the USAID thing that it had Steve Bannon’s fingerprints all over it b/c neither Trump nor Musk were Washington insiders and therefore could not have known that “if you pull on that string right there (USAID), the whole thing will unravel.” But Bannon *was* enough of a Washington insider to know that.

            As I understand Gilbert, he himself is a businessman and speaks mainly for the economic interests within Russia.  I’ve detected a segment of the pro-Russian commentariat that is more than willing to forgive the US in hopes getting back some Western markets.  They’re the ones that speak most glowingly about Trump and his team.  They also try to shift as much blame as possible for the Ukraine fiasco onto the shoulders of the Europeans.

                I’m torn on the issue.  Absolutely value beautiful cathedral; at the same time I can understand that to Estonian nationalists, it’s a symbol of hated cultural conquest.  Of course then one can ask how long a small nation can remain economically viable and independent in any era.  I marveled at many of the mosques I saw in Turkey, but would loathe the sight of them in the US.

                    I know it’s easy for me to say, but the Estonians should let bygones by bygones. Now I’m not expecting the them to send Moscow any love letters, but they should make peace with the past and come together with the rest of the white peoples for our common defense and flourishing. Unfortunately, the BFE’s ongoing crusade against Russia, which includes fanning resentments, makes that a pipe dream for the time being.

            Interesting! I may be in that part of the world at that time as well. Post here again towards June, may be able to connect. I’m actuallyalreadyin that part of the world, but not that far north. If you are a single man you are a kid in a candy store basically, throw a rock hit a thin blue eyed blonde. Sort of like America maybe use to look in the 20th century before it turned into the land of mud genetics.I was originally going to throw a dart at Estonia and I’d be lying if I said that wasn’t one of the reasons but the weather is –brutal– there which put me off a bit for being there anytime past say September.

        “Up until now, policy was centered around moral claims about how the world ought to be ordered.”
Those moral claims were fig leaf, prolefeed. It was material interest all along, but thinly camouflaged by sanctimonious pap. To the great credit of Trump, he has neither time nor patience for this empty posturing. He is more honest. Let the Europeans engage in this — they have a long history of doing so.

            It’s not the Europeans who lecture the rest of the world about the rules-based order, or democracy or being the last great hope of mankind.Shining city on a hill.LOL
Even as you Americans run away from another conflict you are trying to claim the moral high ground with Zelensky. You are doing it personally by trying to imply the Americans are just too honest to make false claims unlike those evil Europeans.
Really is an obnoxious part of your national character; although of fading importance as the white part of your country becomes a smaller and smaller minority.

I’m not sold that this is going to be the end result. Once you’ve got Latin American assimilation, they become White, or at least white enough. Like Italians and all the rest of the Euro kNyghhers like me.

                    I see all the downvotes here. I don’t know where you’re all coming from. If you’re trying to go back to a WASP country, that ship has sailed. That’s a lot of people to throw out. If you’re going to go back to lynching us Southern Europeans, I don’t think that’s going to have a lot of popular support either.The Mexicans and a lot of Latin Americans who come here aren’t that much different. Similar cultures (based in southern Europe), not to mention that Latin America is full of real Europeans too. If Southern Europeans can assimilate, so can they.Final point is that we have a lot of indigenous hispanic people in this country. We’ve got Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexicans that came along with the western states we annexed, then we’ve got that Spanish Asian mix that populate our colonies in the Pacific. You gonna lynch all of them too?😂European-ish is the best you can do at this point. Work on keeping the Asians, Indians (dot) and the the other third worlders out.

Italians, Irish, Greeks though once snubbed at the end of the day areEuropeanto the core of their being.Those little goblinas and mestizos are genetic aliens who ape the culture and try to claim it as their own. Latino? Really! It’s in the NAME.Latinfrom whence did this language or any associated culture originate? Pro tip- it’s not even close to Guatemala.I just recently visited the Ferrari museum and a Lamborghini museumin Italy. We going to see any El Salvadordean super car factories opening? Or maybe the Venezuelan version of Maserati? Such potential! Just stop…This is so absurd on it’s face it doesn’t even warrant discussion.

                                “…tell me this woman looks much different from your average Mexican.”You must not live around Mexicans.  I see them everyday.  There are “high castes” and “low castes”, basically based upon the percentage of “Indio” blood.  Mexicans will admit this.  I don’t particularly care for most purposes.  But the woman you point to is definitely not MX looking.  The tell is the cheekbones.  She has no Indio blood.  She is White with a darker shade of skin typical of the Mediterranean populace.  She would stand out from MX women anywhere—and they’d know the difference themselves.BTW: The good looking MX women are known by their cheekbones and well as other attributes.

                                    I’m speaking strictly skin color. She’s not that much different from the average hispanic. Of course, you are correct that there are also differences among hispanics, but I don’t really want to go into that much detail right now.
The point is, if a bunch of Mediterraneans with odd habits were descending on the United States again, the same people screaming about Mexicans would be screaming about Greeks again. The only difference I see is the Greeks have been here long enough to have assimilated, so their habits don’t annoy those inclined to be annoyed, like Hispanics do.

                                        Skin color is meaningless.  Always has been.  Racial differences encompass much more subtle physical differences.  Sometimes skin color is all you need, but is often deceptive.  Then there is Candice Owens who has had plastic surgery.  Yeah, she’s Black, but all other obvious characteristics have been removed:

                        It’ll come down to religion, i.e., Protestant/Catholic— PROVIDED, Protestants find religion again, which I’m guessing they will, in some way.
White used to equal Protestant, when you think about it, but this was happening as Protestants were secularizing. How did Italians, even Irish, become white? They did like the Protestants, and secularized. America was WASP, probably still is, seeing how it’s falling apart without that identity.
I’m guessing the old lines make a comeback in some form, and things get interesting. Or America continues going away. White ain’t going to save the place.

                                WASP culture, founding stock. Germans fit right in for the most part.
I should admit my definition of WASP is broad. Probably something more like WGP (White Germanic Protestant). Irish and Scots, you got some Viking in you. Been getting down for centuries. Ethnogenesis, especially here in America. Hence the broad definition, for lack of a more specific term.
Which is why I think the religious aspect is important. Kind of the missing ingredient of ethnicity that’s opened the floodgates.

                    Our immigration demographics is better than Europe’s, and more assimilable. TempoNick, despite apparently being Italian, is correct. At least we get a large share of Hispanics that could pass for Greco-Italian. The women are better looking, too. I’ll take this over Muslims and Africans any day…If there are only two choices, which there are.

                        There are many good Latins, honest, hard-working, and functionally Christian.The best of them can form a buffer state to the south of whatever European polity arises in North America after the last twitching death throe of the GAE.However, their higher quality than baseline mesoamerican peasantry does not make them European. Modest admixture simply make them a new kind of people, not a European kind of people. They still have mores, extending from their genome, which are incompatible, different preferences for how organize themselves socially, politically, and economically.There are 200 million unbroken Europeans in North America. We need our own homeland, and we ARE going to have it. I have no problem with us having amicable and cordial relations with Latins to our mutual benefit, but there can be no sharing of power within the same polity.

Frankly, we’ve got no quarrel with Europe. We just want to get free of the Occidental tar baby and let you guys take care of yourselves for a change. Time for y’all to stop wearing diapers and put on a pair of pants.

                As expected, downvotes.  But I read and reread your comment.  It is fair in nature, whether agreed to or not.  The conflict we “run away from”, however is one that was embraced by an old form of “interventionist” policy that has been disputed in this country for generations starting at least to the aftermath of the Vietnam war (my era).As with any democratic elected society, changes in administrations portend changes in policy.  Ukrainian intervention, or even membership in NATO is under consideration every term of years.  You are naive to imagine otherwise.As to the quip, “…of fading importance as the white part of your country becomes a smaller and smaller minority.”  Careful what you wish for.  Not sure of your European origin, but within the primary countries of importance I see no difference between you and us *except* timeline!  We do, have one great advantage over Europe, a centuries long experience in dealing with non-White minorities.  Seems European countries are “babes in the woods” in that respect.﻿

            I cannot agree. The BFE didn’t fly perv pennants outside every one of its embassies because it was trying to free up capital for Black Rock. Ideology is a huge part of the BFE’s machinations, probably coequal with capitalistic greed. The BFE, up until the Trumpening anyway, was the greatest crusader state the world has ever known. And ideology (or religion) is the crusader state’s fuel.

            Managerial class = feminism.  Women love process, men prefer results.  Wilson was a moralizer – but his wife was acting president for half his term.

            As our esteemed host has so brilliantly stated, “Progressivism was created to give moral agency to managerialism”.
Wilsonian Democracy was the export of  progressive managerialism to the entire world.

            Yes. Wilson’s chief advisor, Col. E.M. House, wrote a “fictional” book entitled“Philip Dru, Administrator”which basically outlined his plans for progressive managerial control of society. Wilson went to Versailles with a bunch of academics called “The Inquiry” who were “experts” on how to re-draw the map of Europe. They were the ones who created countries like “Czecho-slovakia,” Poland, and “Jugo-slavia.”We all know how well that worked out in the long run, LOL.The the progressive-managerial revolution has been so successful and so total that people tend to forget that the country existed without it before 1912. In 1912 the first and second place candidates were both “progressives” who believed in expert and centralized managerialism. Roosevelt was trust-buster and a corruption reformer and his party was indeed named the “Progressive Party” and pitched his centralized “New Nationalism” against federalism and decentralization. The hapless “establishment Republican,” Taft, the incumbent, finished a distant third.Almost everyone within the elite class of the era believed in industrial/Fordist managerialism and planning, centralized government, military imperialism, eugenics and white racial superiority. People like Bryan — a Christian Bible thumper and teetotaler who represented small farmers in small-town America — were derided as rubes, hicks and morons. He left Wilson’s administration over its policy toward the war in Europe.

        Does war cause more sober-minded thinking among the people in charge? It can, if those old men running it have some memory of war in their own lives. It’s when they don’t (and when a lot of those “men” making decisions are actually women) that we seem to get in trouble.There’s the story (apocryphal, probably) that when the War Between States was declared, guys were running around shouting: “This is it! We’ve got our war!” A similar phenomenon happened in Germany in the runup to the Great War. There’s that scene in “All Quiet” in which the starched-collared teacher is pouring all his patriotic fervor into the heads of the boys, happy that the enervation and weakness caused by a long stretch of peacetime is finally at an end.With the neocons, it’s even worse than with the clueless reb or yank ululating about how he’s got his war now, or the prim teacher with his pince-nez blathering about one’s duty to the Fatherland. These men and women (if Jennifer Rubin is one) are using war as a LARP, with the people actually doing it as surrogate onscreen avatars. They feel for the Ukrainians what the kids playing their multiplayer online games feel when one of their grunts gets squashed by an alien. Bolton, especially, has the look of a man who masks his lack of bravery with this vicarious larping. It’s all Risk to him; he very much has that vibe of Himmelstoss, the martinet corporal who berates Paul and the boys in “All Quiet” during basic training only to end up cowering in a trench when he gets sent to the frontlines himself.These people all claim to be historians but it’s a pity their historical memory only stretches back to World War Two. The entrenched stalemate in Ukraine has a lot of parallels with the Great War. A lot of death and a lot of losses of land, with no significant retaking of any lost lands. And they lack the excuse of those who got the world involved in the mass slaughter of the Great War. They weren’t sure at that time what exact effect industrialization would have on warfare (they still had horses and generally believed airplanes to be “amusing toys but of no great military significance”) for instance.We all know what nuclear bombs can do, and while we’ve only seen tests of the hydrogen bomb, we might get a chance to see it in the battlespace soon. A “limited nuclear war” strikes me as being similar to being, “a little bit pregnant.”

            The pro war attitude of the western “intelligentsia” towards Ukraine is a direct result of the GAE’s learned adaptation of fighting wars with other country’s soldiers. This is precisely why that adaptation was made. If it was 1,000 American/British/French casualties daily, none of these blithely pro war attitudes could exist. Except perhaps for Bolton’s. I doubt there is any amount of dead, from any country, that could deter his bluster.

            it used to, back when the generals did have that memory or would go to the front line themselves (and send their sons out of a sense of duty). It hasn’t been like that for a while though. The W misadventures were plagued by magical thinking, thinking we could turn Afghanistan into a feminist paradise and Iraq into a free market wonderland, Houston-on-the-Tigris.

            Not sure how true it is, but it’s definitely a theme in the literature: The European nations’ entries into WWI werecelebrations—expressions of ecstaticrelief. Waiting for the war is over! Of course rallies can be arranged for the press to exaggerate, and men to whom death isn’t real can become grandiose about it, etc., but there seems to have been some real mass hysteria.(The fashion when I was in school, during an earlier iteration of “wokeness” (the “postmodern” one), was to blame that hysteria onmodern art. Yes, the same old stuff conservatives hate: cubism, dada,Pierrot Lunaire, etc.—all of it condemned as white male perversion. Trench warfare was an excuse for them finally to drop the artistic pretense and literallyplay in shit, you see.)We might be in that kind of hysteria now, beginning (on command) over Ukraine—and now “Europe” going mad, Canada talking about nuking America, etc. The regime is of course insane, but now the average news consumer is really getting into it, reveling in visions of total death, making wild social media threats, booing for television, etc.And the proximate inspiration for it is Trump’snot being like that—being a “realist” (partly via comically imperialist Teddy Roosevelt rhetoric, which might not work out).Fun times.

                I don’t know if it correlates to WW1, but we see the search for meaning, the need to be part of something larger and more meaningful than one’s self, over and over (in people who lack any other source of spiritual meaning). Just 5 years ago (how the time flies), I saw media characterizations of the plandemic as “our generation’s WW2.” Remember that? By wearing that mask and taking that jab, you were doing your part to win WW2! Same thing now with putting a Ukraine flag in one’s social media profile. These people don’t have anywhere else to find meaning.

                    Back in 2020/21 in my burg, it was not uncommon to see “We’re all in this together!” signs in front yards. Was this a function of the search for meaning? Sure. Let us all link arms in solidarity to confront the Great Existential Threat. But it was also a function of the feminization of America. In times past, when pestilence,realpestilence such as influenza (1919) struck, Americans stiffened their upper lip and soldiered through as best they could. That is what a manly country does. But a century later we mewed, caterwauled, scolded, placed palliative signs in our yards and wore ridiculous masks. Perhaps the feminizationwasthe meaning.

            “The entrenched stalemate in Ukraine has a lot of parallels with the Great War. A lot of death and a lot of losses of land, with no significant retaking of any lost lands.”if this is your understanding of the current situation, then you have no hope of understanding events further.There is no stalemate on the ground.There has not been for about two years. The front everywhere crumbles for the Uke’s. You live in a past reality, perhaps that of WWII and “big arrow” offensives. Russia—ala Putin—has a different goal/strategy. Putin is grinding the forces of Ukraine down while rounding out the annexed (Russian ethnic) territories, which will become part—are now part—of the Russian Federation.To conquer Ukraine with a big arrow offensive requires sustaining losses for both Russians and Ukrainians—at least an order of magnitude higher. Yes, perhaps “ripping the bandage off” was the best strategy in hindsight, but that was then. Putin has little to no interest in “Ukraine” per se. Only that the Russian population’s rights are protected—this is mostly accomplished—and Ukraine is no longer a viable threat on the border. Until that time, he’s willing to grind down the cream of Ukraine’s young men which will assure a weakened Ukraine perhaps never to re-emerge for several generations.There is no solution to the Uke crisis except surrender of the Uke’s and a banishment of their current regime. Putin holds the cards. Now we are certain to see a “peace treaty” signing with the West claiming a victory of sorts. We saw similar BS in all our direct and proxy wars since Vietnam. In reality however, it will be a capitulation to all Putin’s demands.And even a final “peace” treaty will play into Putin’s hands as possession of the entire country, and its subsequent rebuilding, would place a heavy burden on the Russian economy for years to come. Let the West put together “Humpty Dumpty”.

                Whenever I hear someone say the word ‘stalemate’ wrt the Russo-Ukraine war, I know I can safely disregard whatever comes after.  Usually it comes from people that still mock Russia for not taking Kiev in 3 days.

        I don’t know if Trump is the one to try this. But the USA has to become accustomed to have international relationships with any country independent of the international media cartel and globohomo clown world politicians.Like normalize relationships with Russia where the Ukraine is just a point in the agenda. But we can also sanction Ukraine if it insists on a cruel war to the last soldier.The Ursulas Van der Clownish will reeee but that’s the point of going back to reality.The real issue is we cannot be the perpetual payers of clown world wars and as Vance pointed out our diplomacy has a cost to us when we cannot act in our own interest because some fake moral reason forces us to be enemies with a country we should not have any problem with.It is psychopathic of Zelenski to pretend we owe money for a war because the God demoncrazy demands it. Same for many other conflicts we apparently owe our money and lives to be sacrificed because the girl boss godesses demand it.

        If you want a good study of Washington, you can’t go wrong with Douglas Southall Freeman’s multivolume biography of the man. His style from the 1930s is a bit dated, and he, of course, didn’t have access to many primary sources we can access today, but that is counterbalanced by Freeman not actively hating his subject.

            But he’s still flummoxed by the extent to which the Israel Lobby controls American foreign policy.
It’s a huge problem for the theory of “Realism,” which holds that nations pursue power politics and follow their own interests. Mearsheimer says that the U.S. Israel relationship is actually counterproductive to U.S. interests, yet no one in the foreign policy establishment or the Congress even questions it.

        Foreign Policy is the handmaiden of national economic interest. Zman tends to focus on moral and political vectors, but we have to consider the strong influence on policy of economic interests. We fought WWI largely because NY banks lent a ton of money to UK and France and we aspired to export more. The US did not have a meaningful manufacturing surplus until 1900, by which point our raw material trade surplus had shrunk to parity. Progressive politics predates our emergence as an industrial exporter and certainly predates modern scientific management (Taylor, Ford, Sloan, Emerson, Drucker). The Progressive movement was grafted on to US foreign policy as a tool for  and justification of our economic expansion, not merely as vehicle for moral preening.

        And I’m going to lay this out which won’t be popular. I despise Wilson’s sanctimonious moralizing as much as the next man, but you do have to take into account the historical context of the revulsion the Great War caused in the West among people with a 19th century concept of acceptable conduct of war, which the very brief (1914-1918) era of total industrial war, with millions of dead, was a shock that simply had no historical precedent, and the crowned heads of Europe, especially Victoria’s idiot grandchildren, mostly Wilhelm and Nicholas, were primary drivers of. The Germans did implement the first use of poison gas warfare, aerial bombing of civilians, and unrestricted submarine warfare, and did so in such a flagrant manner that it genuinely did violate civilized standards which, in conjunction with the very real self interest of the United States in curbing Imperial Germany’s global ambitions makes Wilson’s determination to end that horror somewhat understandable. We have all grown up in a world where Germany is a gelded eunuch for so long that we forget that they were rightfully regarded from 1885 on as a dangerous nation with a mentally unstable emperor, a ruthless army and a navy larger than the United States Navy.

                    The french did gas warfare first, they just weren’t good at it and it backfired on them. The germans were only the first ones to do it *successfully*. Every involved party was ready to throw down everything they had over the pointless squabble, the germans were just more competent at it than the other involved parties (for the most part). Assigning blame to germany over WW1 is just stupid. Most of the european powers didn’t like having a new kid on the empire block. The “Wilhelm was a crazy lunatic” meme was mostly propaganda. Funny how the people you mentioned, such as Bismarck, didn’t like him already before they started saying he was crazy. Also funny how every boogeyman is a crazy monster. Always has been. The germans had it coming because they bayonetted belgian babies too, right?

            I find the Ukraine business an echo of the First World War in that at least one side doesn’t understand the sunken cost fallacy.  In WW1 it could be said all the players kept throwing blood and treasure into the fray because so much had been sacrificed, giving up was unthinkable.
In Ukraine, the West, [with the exception of Trump and his minions] cannot conceive that the last three years were a waste and calling it quits is the best option.  Or maybe they just don’t want a profitable scam to end.

                There’s that and probably something to the fact that the only acceptable ethnic hatred white Western Europeans are allowed to have now is the centuries old hatred of Russians (beyond the hatred that the Kagans and Kristols etc, have had for generations), which has never gone away. Russians are still seen by the West as savage peasant barbarians, who are both mocked and feared.

                    It’s also about preserving the Cold War institutions that would have no reason to exist absent an enemy. Russia fits the bill.

                They need a cover in the form of an outside enemy to blame the impending sovereign debt crisis on. They want war so they can blame Putin for their destruction of their countries.

Absolutely fantastic BBC series from the 70s, when the BBC was still the BBC. I cannot recommend this series too highly. “The Fall of Eagles” title referring to the coats of arms of the houses of Habspburg, Romanov, and Hohenzollern. Really first rate series that no history buff should miss.

                One should always remember that mental illness and straight upinsanityran through most of Europe’s royal families, not least through most of them being to one degree or another descended from the Hanoverian Queen Victoria, where madness and degeneracy (including some serious sexual perversions) runs in the family all the way to the “Windsors” today, and the cousin marriage that produced physical and mental deficiencies in all of them in varying degrees. The Habsburgs are in their own special category as a byword for inbreeding separate from the tainted blood of Victoria, and Vittorio Emanuelle of Italy was a midget mentally and physically- and none of this was much of a secret. Yet these crowned idiots and deviants presumed to immolate all of Europe in blood and then wonder why Wilson and Americans wanted to sweep them all away in the aftermath with some justified moral superiority. Of course the monsters that replaced them in Hitler and Stalin were even worse, but Wilson didn’t have a magic 8 ball in 1917.There was something seriously wrong with Wilhelm II and his own royal relatives thought so, as well as Otto von Bismarck, and others who saw him up close.

                    His royal relatives that just happened to be his grand chessboard rivals and Bismarck, himself an utterly sociopathic lunatic that wasn’t exactly a picture of stability himself and was bitter about his firing, said that about him, huh? I believe it.
