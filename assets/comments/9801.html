        Of course, most of the people who work at the Department of Nice weren’t actually “on campus” when you visited.  Bob and Susie in Accounting left early to attend their 8 year old’s poetry recital at school, and will be “working remotely” the rest of the day so they don’t have to use up their paid vacation days which would shorten their 2-week vacation trip to the Bahamas this spring.  Hajib from IT has class tonight, so he, too, is working remotely.  There’s a big test tonight as he wraps up his CISSP and GIAC.  It’s free for him, since the Department of Nice pays for it, but he will get a nice raise thanks to the additional certifications for his GS-13 step 10 level.  Many more people who work at the Department of Nice have business at the Department of Nothing In Particular in Greenbelt, and either decided to get breakfast on their way to the meeting, or drove to the Department of Nice first, then drive to the other side of the city for a 90 minute meeting and then notice that it’s such a long drive back that they might as well go straight home and finish up the day by working remotely.As you sit down for your meeting, you’re struck by the sheer number of LCD and plasma televisions around campus.  Mostly, they play CNN, which is a great reminder for everyone on campus who is dangerous in the world, or they play information loops about the history of the Department of Nice and the summer picnic, or reminders about free flu shots in the cafeteria.  You notice the chair you are sitting in has more lumbar adjustments than the 27 Acura MDX’s you saw parked in the employee parking lot, and would set you back at least $800 at Office Depot.  The 30′ long mahogany conference table has 20 more chairs around it, and is wired for teleconference, VTC, and resembles a small home theater.Time for some golf…

            “Working remotely” is the biggest boondoggle in the country. I can always tell when my government/education friends are working from home. I get e-mails all day about sports and politics from them.

                It’s how I came up my “Snow Day Furlough Policy”: wait for an inch of snow, and then count heads at the office.  Anybody who doesn’t show up is nonessential.

                    They stopped doing, but they would announce on snow days that “non-essential employees should stay home.” It became a bit of joke as that meant everyone stayed home.
Normies have no idea how life is in government land. Most Fed workers get 6 hours leave time every pay period. The long timers get 8. That’s between 24 and 26 days off a year, plus the 13 holidays. Normies get 10 days and maybe three sick/personal days. Of course, salaried people in the dreaded private sector can expect some long days and weekends at the minimum.

                I work remotely. It’s an hour and a half commute each way. When I get there, I am logged into the phones and seldom get to talk to anyone any way. And the state of Oregon taxes me for the privilege of working there, even though I am not a resident. Maybe the government workers don’t do any work remotely, but the rest of us do.

                    I have a home office as well, because the business I own gives me ability to do the things in the office that require my office, and the things in my house that I can do from the house.  Heading there shortly because I have some work to do that I cannot do from my remote application.  But at the end of the day, I have direct customers and very specific products and services that I have to deliver at a very high level of quality and craftsmanship.Your average government employee is “working from home” by keeping their Outlook window open in case anybody emails them, and listening in silently on teleconferences for things they don’t know a lot about, while surfing the web, but will spend the next 8 hours writing a 2 page meeting summary (if they don’t have a contractor who they can make write it for them).One of my favorite things to do when I worked in that world was ask for a physical product for their day “working remotely”.  Maybe an engineering analysis, a operational plan, couple of sets of meeting minutes, a lab design, a marketing presentation/deck, some drafts of their sections of the proposal they were assigned to help write.Crickets baby.

            By their certificates and their ostentatious display of them you will know them. Attempting to read them from a distance is one way to look serious in a meeting with them in their office.

                Government certifications are a racket that is as close to a self licking ice cream cone as you can get.  OPM allows agencies to pay for certifications.  Therefore, certifications are invented to give the agency something to pay for.  The employees sign up because it is free, AND they can escape the office to attend the classes, plus the certification affects their step and pay.  The agency gets to talk about the expertise of its employees, and how it is “taking care of people”.  The certification organization collects the money, and uses it to develop additional certification levels (which everybody knows a Level 1 isn’t nearly as expert as a Level 3.  God, why do they even let Level 1’s attend the meetings?!!).  The employee gets the raise, and new business cards, and their email signature block swells by another acronym.  Sweet!And all the bills get sent to the “taxpayers”, which the people at the Dept of Nice all consider themselves to be…but they’re not taxpayers.

                    I once had a debate of sorts with a school teacher about this. He claimed that the education requirements of his field made him underpaid compared to people in the private sector with similar credentials. I probably should not have laughed in his face, but it was so absurd I could not help myself. I explained to him that his masters in education was worthless outside of public schools. Even private and parochial schools had no use for it. He kept insisting that he was required to get the credential, as well as other credentials.The hilarious part was that he taught elementary school.

                        The get BA, MA’s, and PhD’s in Education because they don’t have to do any math.Had a similar argument recently with a govvie who was apoplectic when I pointed out that she actually pays no income taxes.  Money came out of the Treasury that she didn’t put there.  Every April, she files a 1040 form to return to the Treasury what she was overpaid, or, if her income is low enough, to withdraw ADDITIONAL money she didn’t earn in the form of various tax credits.You can’t fill a pool by returning 17% of the water you took out of it.By the time she was done, she was down to I just hate Government people and teachers. Lol, people who are bad at math.

                            Ed majors are legendarily dumb — and legendarily easy, at least back in the Jurassic when I was an undergrad — but nothing compares to the tertiary-degreed dumb of an ed administrator.  Most of the people who run the schools, make the standardized tests, etc. have never seen a classroom.  The fastest way to get them sweating is to suggest actual contact with the students.  In terms of uselessness per minute of coursework, Education gives Gender Studies a run for its money.

        The certainty of government revenue is the root of all “niceness.”
We need a regular review of every government department that would require management to justify every single employee’s retention.
Regular pruning of deadwood would introduce an element of uncertainty into what is now life-long employment.
Give them a taste of what the rest of us live with … uncertainty.

            “We need a regular review of every government department that would require management to justify every single employee’s retention.”
It’s called Zero-Based Budgeting. It’s a well-defined business idea that has been around for many decades. It’s not a popular idea inside the beltway.

                Then there is the corporate idea of simply asking “What business are we in?”  That might lead to divesting divisions, closing others, reducing investments in some, etc., focusing limited resources on the strategic areas for optimum results.  Of course, we would need to have an honest appraisal for each department/agency which would be problematic.  You need zero based budgeting plus an executive team who can make the tough decisions on what gets funding and what gets cut.  It just doesn’t make sense to slowly starve a dying business.  Fish or cut bait.

            Sadly, they are still safe.  It’s called the Potomac two step, where former senior and middle management government officers find work with a “Beltway bandit” consulting firm/government contractor that is retained by the federal government for a myriad of tasks for their supposed expertise.  Often times, that is actually a better gig overall than working directly for Uncle Sam.  Such firms live and die by government contracts and there is never a shortage of such lucrative contracts.  I’ve seen government employees work for the USG for 30 years, “retire” and then come back to work in the same building as a contractor hired from some such firm.  The degree of uncertainty in such arrangements in nothing like what those in the private sector face daily.

        Nice.  I work at a company headquarters located on an old farm so it has kind of a campus feel to it in nice weather.  Except, people walk to hallways with purpose.  They’ll stop to chat for a minute, but check their watches or phones after a minute to make sure they aren’t missing a meeting.Those Goths who first burst into Rome must have thought they had entered whatever version of heaven they believed in.  So much wealth – and people so fat and soft they couldn’t put up a fight.  Someday out campuses and imperial capital will be cracked open the same way because history has not ended.

Your campuses and imperial capital have been cracked wide open, you just aren’t yet aware of the true scope of the disaster.
Anyway, they weren’t “cracked”. As is usual in these circumstances they were opened voluntarily by crazies and traitors. But you knew that.

        Ahhh, campus.  I’m a deep-cover shitlord at the local U, and it’s every bit as nice as you describe… and every bit as clueless.  Since Trump’s ascent I’ve been all smiles, as they’ve never experienced anything like a challenge to their worldview before and it’s just so easy to tweak them.  I’ll hear some colleague or student go off about how much she fears the coming TrumperiKKKa Gestapo, and I reply “why yes, I’m terrified too, that’s why I bought a nice new Mossberg 12 gauge.  They’ll never take me alive!”  Totally fries their circuits.  Their brains are tapioca, but the diversity — by which I mean the ethic restaurants — is nice.

        There’s reason right there what Z is saying, to be deeply concerned what the so called deep state will do to pull off their coupe against the duly and legitimate elected President Trump and his administration.I keep trying to figure out what limits there are if any to how far the city of nice will go to survive it’s illegitimacy. They certainly appear to be a separate class of people who rule by the rule there are no rules but their continued survival.Are they capable of destroying everything in their desperation to retain their corporate slave world? The big question is, if they are faced with loosing their rice bowls, an existential thing for them for sure, what are they capable of? Being a dirt person, I can’t see how even without a coupe, they can survive, the money is running out. But then I think, Trump is in one way their savor, because if he can stimulate the economy, maybe the money don’t run out, and their rice bowls are safe.These are instinctual people, they smell a dirt person from a mile away, they are surrounded by dirt people. They despise dirt people. They can not survive without dirt people to rob of their wealth to pay for their city of nice. The dirt people are becoming quite restless and fed up being indentured slaves to the city of nice.What gets me, Trump wasn’t possible without that great fuck you of the dirt people to the occupants of the city of nice. The dirt people are armed on the scale of 1st world nations. Not a few are fed up. Cold anger is something to be taken frivolously or with contempt. Is there a natural balance here in the dynamics of the nice people coupe? Is their coupe just flexing their class muscles, a soft coupe to show who really has the power in the city of nice?Will their grip on the levers of power be at first difficult to remove, and like all illegitimate forms of tyranny, once their grasp is loosened they quickly crumble, a trait all forms of tyranny share in common when faced with the wrath of those they so long abused, the dirt people?

        For a short period of time, much of the economy was based on such “nice” work;  Life-long careers with the same employers.  Things have changed for the rest of the world outside the Emerald City but the denizens therein will do everything they can to maintain their little, well, not so little, slice of heaven on earth.  Of course, they are completely ignorant of just what or who it is that foots the fill … the taxes paid by Deplorables.

                You are right, to a degree.  Of course with the jobs in the real world, results mattered.  But my point was more about how things change except for the Elites.  But it must have been nice to spend your entire career with the same company, a relatively safe, secure place to earn a living while the world recovered from WW2.
Once credit cards, two worker families (feminism), and consumerism rose, then chaos had to reign and stability had to go.

        Well, I work in government too, albeit not in your country. The security is nice, although we’ve seen major cuts in the past 20 years a couple of times it’s still not the private sector.OTOH, my department is not on a campus, it’s in a once-nice building just off downtown. I often pass by our major downtown mall of an evening or weekend, and it’s in a neighbourhood with several rescue missions and shelters yet also adjacent to our main restaurant and club district. The main street is about as urban as our nice country gets. The 24hr Mcdonald’s is a treat to sit in some nights. Not dangerous, but interesting to observe the full range of types. Or most of the range. Not quite full.I like my nice country, even if I share none of its values any more. It’s nice. I even think what I do has value, though it’s a support function for a department whose larger mission is encumbered with tons of moral-vanity projects and self-indulgent preening. As we just had International Women’s Day, just imagine.On the whole, I agreed with Mattis when he implied cuts to such things as State could be ill-advised. But it depends on what you cut, always.I guess what I’m saying is I can never be a true Dirt Man by social status, profession, or indeed geography. But I don’t share Cloud Values. I’m actually worried since last year that the values of the Cloud have moved so far left without my noticing it fully that I might have a serious mental breakdown from cognitive dissonance one day. We’ll see.I’m also waiting for the Visigoths. I honestly no longer know whether I will fear or welcome them. Or who they’ll be. It’s not the Dirt People. They are still my kin and nation.

            Sounds like Ottawa. My sister-in-law is a federal employee there. She basically does jack shit and routinely takes four- to six-week leaves of absence to do … well, who knows. Plot her retirement, I guess. My wife worked for the CA federal government for all of a week then quit because of the fake work everybody spent their time pretending to do. My mom worked for a short time in D.C. at an agency under contract to the DOE. She did lots and lots of crosswords, and every Friday was (unofficially) a half day because all their counterparts at the DOE left work at noon.

        We had sort of an amazing thing happen, here in blue state.  We are looking at a house in another county. We found out they replaced the septic tank in 1994 without any permits. In this county, this would be an excuse for the bureaucrats to make your life hell. My husband called and talked to the bureaucrats in that county. They said no big deal. They aren’t interested in what happened back  then. Said we’d just need to have it inspected before we buy it. And they didn’t think we’d have any problems putting in a new well, if we want to. That’s the way that bureaucrats are supposed to work. Making your life a living hell should not be part of the job description.

            I know that you are NOT talking about Massachusetts.
After the fire the cost to connect to town sewage (we were forbidden to reconnect to our working septic field) was 45 thousand dollars.  And our water/sewer bill the decimal point moved one point to the right.
The big reason, cleanup of Boston Harbor.  Until we were forced into connection none of our sh*t went into Boston Harbor.
Nice.  See? I’m smiling Sir.

                No, but it’s in WA state! We have a piece of property that has a mobile home on it. We’d like to replace it with a newer one It’s considered in the city, as they drew the lines to take in the park net to us. (They also zoned our place park even though it’s been privately owned since pre-statehood). We can only put in the exact same sized double wide, but it has to be newer than 2006. The problem is that they didn’t make double wides our size in 2006. They were bigger. So we can go through Labor and Industries and rebuild the current one, one wall at a time.And don’t get me started on DNR.

        I believe we live in a sort of faux society of nice. The last 50 years in the USA have been one of those unusual bubbles in time where virtually no one starved, animals wouldn’t eat you, and the tribe over the next hill wouldn’t try to kill you and take your stuff. This has convinced most Americans that this is normal, when it is anything but. A big part of the job for those in the assorted Departments of Nice, is to convince the sheeple that this “nice” is normal and it exists because of the Nice workers. For many it’s true, because it’s built on the labor and intelligence of others. Nice!

        Comparing the state of things now to Rome I’d have to say that we are still in the Principate phase. The Dominate is yet to come where everything is set up along military lines in order to facilitate efficiency and order. It will give the impression that things are running more smoothly and that they are more manageable, but they won’t be. It will SAP the strength out of the people even more so. Then the barbarians will be able to walk in. Only we will be the barbarians.

        I remember my campus experience decades age populated by a significant number of single or married students working their way through school, and were well acquitted with the real world and its stresses. There was no safety net for them or me from the slings and arrows of fortune.
But with the advent of easily accessible school loans, it appears that most college students are living in lotus land, and look at the real world as a anomaly that puzzles them as to why everyone can’t be serene and ordered as they are in their secured playpen.

        Apropos of nothing, a contrast that illustrates our world for me, today at least.This morning I am listening to Brahms’ Variations on a Theme By Haydn, Elgar’s Enigma Variations, and selections from Wagner’s Parsifal, in recordings ranging from 1958-1975, on a disc produced by Deutsche Grammophon in 2005, in a Japanese edition that just arrived from Japan via an Amazon order. I’d miss this version of our world.OTOH, last night for entirely unrelated reasons [I was doing a search on the surname] I learned about feminist philosopher Astrida Neimanis. Near as I can tell without studying phenomenology, she focuses on the relationship among gender, sex, the body, whether the human body is separate from its environment, the fact that we consist mainly of water, and how this means we should relate to the water supply of the world. And queer theory. Gotta include queer theory.So I did have a brief WTF moment. But it’s more weariness now than shock. Even if I had the philosopher’s vocabulary to use, I still wouldn’t know what these people are talking about.Every civilization has its shamans, its priests, mages, and sorcerers, and the share out the duties of persuading the masses by rituals at one end and probing arcane mysteries with fictional codes at the other. Just imagine- I bet these people think systematic theology was a fictitious waste of time.By the end, I suspect our civilization will either be Muslim or we will worship the Goddess Mother in the form of a golden idol in the shape of female genitalia. And Trevor Noah will still be there to tell us how ‘powerful’ the latter is.Mercifully, the Visigoths of the day will be outside the gate by then and the muezzin’s call will be heard in the hills.

        Nice Essay 🙂  I recall that where actual stuff gets made or done there was not much time or money for ‘nice’.  For example, In the operational units of the Armed Forces during the Cold War, desks were steel (GSA gray #2) and office partitions were only other than gray in ‘flag country’.  Don’t know about the pentagonal puzzle palace because as a field officer you avoided it like the plague. Not many good things were likely to happen to a JO caught out of cover by the many, many WWII holdovers looking to regain their long lost sense of purpose at your expense.Likewise in businesses that made or did things, offices tended to be spartan so long as the business was in a fast growth mode where promotions for white males were plentiful.  Only later in the technology cycle, when things slowed down, and the power skirts showed up, did ‘nice’ make its appearance.Of course, banks and law offices were always nice looking.  But it was a facade: The guy in the next cubicle or closet would cut your throat for a chance at a ticket up to a real office with nice amenities.  IOW, it was nice digs or nice associates and with nice prospects, pick one.It appears that the Imperial Bureaucracy has magically escaped this past reality.  But magic spells can only be cast by ‘visionaries’ and it sounds like the one you saw feels no need to even repeat the incantation (actually good news for the pink-slip hatchet person we all hope is coming).

            Facade for sure. At a prominent progressive liberal university that shall remain unnamed to protect the innocent,lower tier employees are overworked, underpaid, and lack sufficient resources to do their jobs because of ongoing budget restraints,yet upper tier management always seem to enjoy their pay raises, extra admin support, and perks. Seems even among liberal academics some are more equal than others.

                Can confirm.  We recently cut some scholarships and are cutting back adjunct hiring due to budget cuts; the Diversity Outreach office still has a Dean, an Assistant Dean, a Provost, an Assistant Provost, a Coordinator, an Assistant Coordinator… and the football coach still gets paid approximately $500,000 per victory.

Undoubtedly true, but at least Football coaches can financially justify their existence. You can’t say that about most of those employed in academia.

        If it isn’t worth doing at all, it isn’t worth doing well.That became one of my favorite sayings from the moment I read it, and I think it applies here. All the governments bureaucrats in their nice sinecures- like the nice diversity consultants and nice sociologists and nice human resource managers- are too often rather indifferent to their jobs.After all, it doesn’t really matter. If you make a mess someone else always has to clean it up- or else.That isn’t nice- but so what? If you’re a government bureaucrat, you make the rules and set the penalty for breaking them. Many of these jobs exist only because of government decrees, which are of course law.It reminds of the US steel industry, circa 1970. I use to work at a steel mill, and I did some reading about the history of the industry. For a long time there was so much money sloshing around that nobody ever suspected the gravy train could ever end. Hence, these companies retained swarms of employees for long after they needed them, just to keep the unions quiet. At one point, long before I got there, my future employer had a contract in which employees were offered 26 weeks of vacation, on a rotating schedule intended to avoid layoffs.Then reality caught up, which definitely was not nice. Mass layoffs happened and- much later- I had occasion to come across dust-covered personal items that had been left in lockers that employees had expected to recover. But they didn’t, because they never came back.Reality is that which doesn’t go away when you stop believing in it. Another of my favorite sayings, and I fully expect reality will visit the swarms of the useless eaters who comprise so much of the government today.And- to continue a theme- not in a nice way, at all.

        Epic, and I don’t mean “nice!”  Earlier today, I was pondering the fact that, like the Department of Nice, a couple of my friends live in a complete fantasy world of infinite expenditure for no actual purpose, which is not a problem because more money can always be printed or borrowed. I’m starting to wonder if Trump is living in such a world….

        This is dead-on accurate and why it’s more important to impose job term limits on ALL Gov’t employees as opposed to closing a Dept. here or there or reducing it’s size. ABSOLUTELY NO Federal employee should be permitted to work for the FED in any capacity for longer than 10 years (about a quarter of one’s productive working years), after which time they MUST exit Fed service and seek employment in the private sector. No connection with the FED IN ANY WAY allowed in the civilian sector job. Do this for all FED employees…NO EXCEPTION. It would then become unpopular to work the FED knowing that inevitably you’d have to return to the private sector for a real living. If caught working for any civilian job that any way ties to Gov’t whatsoever suffer the penalty….complete loss of retirement benefits. That’s how you drain a swamp!!!!

        Can someone please explain to me why government employees were ever allowed to be given loans of any kind?  Is a mortgage or a car loan not a direct tax on working people?
