        “The civil rights revolution created a legal framework to impose what cannot happen naturally.”
And it’s one of the reasons why the USA is such a crud place to start and build a business. What’s left are the established monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels that can shrug this off as another cost to doing business and can pass the increased costs along to the hapless customer in a rigged and controlled market.

            During the big affirmative action cases around 2000 in the Supreme Court, a bunch of big corporations wrote amicus briefs arguing that the count not only should allow affirmative action but that it should be applied to all companies – big and small. They argued that the big companies were at a disadvantage because they had to have AA programs while small companies didn’t. They wanted to level the playing field by forcing every company to have worthless blacks.

                Of course the opposite is true.  For example, the largest, brick and mortar retailer—Walmart—has always supported minimum wage laws, whereas the smaller employers (competition) opposed them.  Why?  Walmart could withstand such cost of business increases, while their local competition could not.
Small business carve outs to these type of destructive laws were enacted precisely because of this phenomenon.

                    Also, enforcing these laws against Mom and Pop businesses is simply impractical…Here in Arizona, the minimum wage is largely irrelevant, because you can’t get competent workers who show up every day without paying them significantly more than the minimum wage….

                        Yep, and here in my part of AZ, the minimum wages increase has been pretty much wiped out by Biden in one term.  In short, those on the lowest SES rung are no better off than when the minimum wage was half the current amount.  What I see in the fast food places are the same as always—kids with after school jobs, oldsters having to work to make ends meet.

        Many degenerate third-world deep blue cities have MBE/WBE bid requirements. If you want this contract White owned company, you have to have 20% Minority Business Enterprise participation. What happens? 20% of the subcontracts go to minority firms that then sub the work out to White firms and rake a percentage off the top. If you want to see a fun fight watch a deep blue city council argue with their citizenry whether or not brown people are considered minorities for purposes of minority participation. I haven’t seen a tranny try and claim WBE status yet, but I’m sure it’s coming. It’s all a grift.

            Sounds like when corporations wanted to manufacture in China and they had to have a minority chinese owner.  One wonders, China didn’t do a Manchurian candidate, they got an entire party.

            Ah, back in the Old Days in Chicago a “Woman Run Business” was a front for say a construction firm that was the owner’s Old Lady set up as a Potemkin Owner. She signed the contract and passed the work to the Old Man’s company as a subcontractor.Because we all know how many women want to run an excavating firm and learn to work a backhoe. 😉I suspect it’s the same thing with Minority Run Businesses: Some dude with some beat up trucks and Bobcats and a few fresh across the border workers who shares the work and the sweet, sweet dineros with a bigger firm.

                The situation is aptly demonstrated in my burg without necessity of law.  We are majority Hispanic, but rarely for any service contracted will you see a Hispanic do the initial sales pitch, or represent the company in negotiations.  But once contract signed, the workers are all Hispanic—and most not conversant in the English language.  It’s a racket.  Sigh.

                My large, local, state university naturally prefers to contract with wog- and broad-owned businesses, which cuts white firms out of many lucrative contracts.  In response, a local white-owned office supply business changed its name to Navajo Office Supply (one of the owners was a quarter Injun or some such) to game the DIE scam.

            This is basically what I do all day, dealing with this type of entity. I’m long past the point of caring because I’m on the take just like everyone else milking Leviathan for all it is worth.I am on Zoom calls with sassy black wahmen who get to the front of the line because they are BOTH MBE (Minority Biz Enterprise) and WBE (Women Biz Enterprise). This twofer gets them to the front of the line for federal and state contracting. They get the 20% cut and then either one of 2 things happen.1) Like the mafia, the actual business just sends them the grift checks and tells them quietly to “stay out of the way”. Grifters cash the checks and do almost no actual work.OR2) As described above the sassy black wahmen in “Information Technology” hires not Whites as listed here, but in many cases some very cheap pajeets to do the actual “work”. There have also been some recent cases where I see beta white males on the sassy black wahmen payroll too. This they accept gladly because in liberal bughives being an “ally” (read: servant / dhimmi) is the most noble thing a white male can do. There are probably a few that are /ourguys/ but just realize they have to take the ticket if they want to eat/work in this DEI hellhole especially with Fed and State carveouts.

        As long as the diversity is in our country, it will be attacking us. The solution to the problem of discrimination against Europeans inside European countries is not to pass laws against it which will never be enforced, but to remove the non-Europeans. This means collapse is still the cure.

        The rearguard action of being colorblind won’t stop the lawfare because it leaves unaddressed the elephant in the living room: Genetic differences in capabilities among the races and gender.Disparate impact still reigns legally supreme. Our society – our legal system – assumes all groups are equally capable; therefore, any differences in outcomes is proof of discrimination.The best that the colorblind CivNats could hope for is that the courts move the burden of proof onto the accuser that there is intent, but the differing outcomes will remain. How will those be explained? It’s why the race hustlers were so big on unconscious bias. That was the way to square the circle of no evidence of racial discrimination with differing outcomes.Until you accept racial and gender differences, the lawfare will continue.

            Technically (legally) you can hire, fire, promote according to merit—which would leave most minorities out of contention.  Practically it is impossible due to case law challenging such “measurements” upon the very concept of their creation—discrimination!  Businesses have long given up trying to implement such standards.  Even in my old institution, the HR department took me over the coals when I did such and used that to hire one candidate over another.  All such “tests” had to be authorized and meet standards which were pretty much impossible to design to meet such qualifications.

            In academia, the study of racial differences is increasingly suppressed, so it’s getting harder to appeal to science to refute universal egalitarianism.
On the street however, the widespread social media sharing of things like violent chimpouts caught on cell phone video are becoming ubiquitous.

                There is a new force in play, the “independent researcher”.  Much new discovery and review of research is being done through such people.  In some cases they do have university connections , but are not in their employ.  They are also published in journals as well, although this is not considered evidence of quality and the time from submission to publication is waay too slow for such a fast moving field.  Most of my information these days comes through such people.

                    This is good to hear, Compsci, and hearty that people are still interested to ask such questions.But, per my reply above, we likely haven’t needed researched to tell us about black dysfunction for ages. To be fair, it doesn’t matter, diehard leftists (and even liberals on their leftward transition) will never admit these things, science or not.The simple facts in our favour are often one-word answers: Africa or Baltimore. And of course, the very fact that:A leftist (or liberal on her leftward transition)neverlives next door to the diversity she praises.God bless you and yours. Hope you’re keeping well.

                Yeah, was going to say, we don’t need studies from people telling us about this race difference thing or, more accurately, black dysfunction… it’s obvious to anybody who opens their eyes.And if they don’t open their eyes, feel free to point out pain points like: Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Haiti, The Dominican Republic, The Congo, Somalia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and so on, and on.On the home front, an easy win is to simply point out the incredible violence and decline in black dominated neighbourhoods.Whenever some person comes at us with the science, we should simply remember the numerous country and city wide examples that are on display, daily, for all to see.

                            I can’t recall when I had the “epiphany”.  It must have been when I was a graduate majoring in Research and Measurement.  The situations under study were almost always concerning human subjects.  People are different—even the proverbial “college sophomore experimental volunteers”.  From there it’s an easy thing to see “groupings” or clusters.

                                With me, it was clear as mother’s milk. A Hutu pack moved into the rental house across the street and I was thunderstruck by just how disturbingly different they were from everybody else. Not merely different but inferior in an extremely unpleasant way.When I was a teen whose greatest concern was being hip, such unpleasantness was inconsequential. As an adult homeowner with a wife to care for, I saw things in a wholly different light. Wasn’t long after that that we began house hunting and the Mexicans living next door to the Hutus put their house up for sale, too. Hardly coincidental, methinks.

                                    I remember moving to a blue city and within a month or two, I was a different man. It is like that meme of a regular white guy reading a newspaper and morphing into mustache man as he reads it. It was just impossible to live in that city without seeing the differences on a daily basis. Thing is, I am reasonably intelligent but not the smartest person ever. I was surrounded by other white and fellow-white people, of similar if not higher intelligence than me. There is no way they didn’t see it too. I started thinking about the insanity of the modern city where you have these vibrants and then a class of people who just kowtow to them while secretly fuming. I started wondering if liberals seem insane because of the cognitive dissonance in their head, something that seemed to be borne out in 2020.Colorblind meritocracy/I dont see color/in this house we believe/etc. is a luxury belief you get when you grow up and live in a world surrounded by your own people.

                I increasingly see comments indicating that more people are ‘noticing’ non-Whites’ propensity for violence and theft etc.However, I also see – often in the very same comments – people lamenting that the poor non-White chirren ‘don’t deserve’ to have such lousy people as parents.  Despite decades of documented studies showing that non-Whites adopted andraised by White families have academic and personality outcomes more closely matching their genetic background than their economic or cultural environment, people still desperately want to believe that a child is born a blank slate with infinite potential.  They cannot accept that an ‘innocent’ black baby WILL be a serial criminal and net drain on society – not to mention a personal danger to them.

        The biden admin completely seized control of commercial drivers licenses, you can’t just go &amp; take a test anymore you MUST go to school &amp; private schools are outlawed- the government controls it now. It’s close to ten grand to take those classes to get your license now so what was once a low barrier blue collar industry has a significant price barrier.Oh but it gets better! They have affirmative action for diversity who also don’t have to pay for the school, if you’re black you get a commercial license for free &amp; it doesn’t matter if you have a horrific driving record, pass the melanin test you’re in.That coincides with state level diversity quotas being enforced on bids for public infrastructure contracts- in other words most construction work. This isn’t limited to blue states or cities either &amp; even when its not most of the places that need infrastructure work are in decaying blue cities so there’s really no escaping it if you want to stay in business.Used to be around one fifth of theyl work force had to be diverse so companies would just place these people into unimportant positions so they wouldn’t interfere with the job. No more, the quotas are higher &amp; are now very specific, so you have to hire trucks owned by diversity who will have ridiculous turnover rates because they either don’t show up or if they do they’re late. Even when they do it takes them significantly longer to accomplish the same thing a non affirmative action hire would do so companies are paying a ridiculously high diversity tax bleeding money.The insurance rates have sky rocketed across the board to account for hiring these people because they have such terrible driving records. It doesn’t matter if your driving squeaky clean somebody’s gotta cover the cost &amp; it sure as hell isn’t going to be these deadbeat fly by night diversity companies who got government grants &amp; almost always go bankrupt from never paying their taxes.Worst of all is the danger of these people, it was bad enough that you had to let these people hang around dangerous equipment &amp; watch them like a hawk because they’re so stupid. Now they’re in 50 ton dump trucks that they can’t drive competently when they’re empty let alone loaded up &amp; I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen power lines &amp; highway signs ripped down from them leaving their beds up. The amount of people who have been killed by these drivers has increased in proportion to the diversity quotas the cities &amp; states have put on them.It goes on &amp; on, things you’d never even imagine going wrong are now commonplace, idiots making measurement errors. Stuff like digging down cutting internet lines where there was clear markings which then needs to be fixed are now extremely common.You don’t really realize how smoothly things were running until you have a bunch of bantu being put in charge of maintaining infrastructure. Its almost an art form of incompetence, you can even think of the almost ingenious &amp; creative ways they fuck things up,  its beyond comprehension that someone could be so dumb but thats the norm.No one will reverse these things, at best it’ll slow down for four years but its only going to get ratcheted up as the country becomes less &amp; less White as it has been.

        At least civil rights legitimacy (among others) can still be criticized and mocked here.  In places like Germany, you’d probably be arrested.  The legal system, along with most other governmental institutions needs to be burned to the ground.  Of course the public needs gave some protections from charlatans, liars and defective products etc., but it’s so overboard these days, it’s a complete joke.

            I expect that W Europe-Canada-ANZ will be a few years behind the US in terms of openly mocking the DEI globohomo. As always, the United States is leading the charge, be it the adoption of DEI globohomo or the reducing of it. There’s one good thing about running dogs, is that they will run wherever you go.

            Yes. As Z noted, this was the primary reason behind the often successful censorship attempts. Those will not stop, at least yet, and in some ways Western Europe may be a harbinger of things to come here. The United States already is far worse demographically than Europe and that will make it difficult to end censorship since “free speech” very much is a white thing.

        ‘Again, anyone familiar with corporate life knows that “diversity” has been a part of the system for decades, long before Mr. Rufo noticed them.’When I separated from the military in 1974, I immediately enrolled in the local community college.  A group of women (feminists) were busy commandeering the English department for Women ™ and were very proud of their ‘righteous activism on behalf of the oppressed’.  The oppressed in this case meant middle class and UMC white women who went to colleges like Berkeley and lived privileged lives.It was called Affirmative Action back then, and these people have been anchored for 50 years throughout U.S. society — government, law and the courts, corporations, schools and colleges, media, and the ‘churches’.DEI is not going anywhere.  If the heat gets too high, they’ll just shift stuff around a bit and drop the name.  The programs and persons, however, will remain.  Last year it came out that the corporations would not even consider hiring white males.  Did anything change?  Neh.Donald Trump doesn’t have nearly the nads it’d take to get rid of their ubiquitous programs and their tens-of-millions of activists, long since embedded in the fabric of the nation.

            ray-You are absolutely correct that all the diversity baggage has been incubated in the university system for several decades.It was obvious to me when I was on campus in the mid to late 90s. They had even begun the effort to infiltrate it into the STEM via all the different, “student resource groups,” that were based on some arbitrary trait like gender or color.Trump has said some good things, but I share your skepticism about his ability to effect meaningful change. He really would be confronting something that is both totally embedded in our society and titanic in scale.Even if Trump does manage some wins in this space, the diversity gang will simply retreat back to the universities and HR departments until he passes from the scene. I don’t see Vance making a strong push on this front, largely because he will be penned in by his wife and kids.

                    Clearly Vance was groomed to be where he is. The question would be whether he married Usha “organically,” independently of this grooming, or if it was somehow arranged/nudged. I can’t help but suspect the latter. Remember, he went straight to work for John Cornyn out of Yale, then practiced law for a year or two, then became a venture capitalist in San Francisco, as one does, which is where he met Usha.

Bingo!  Why is this so hard for people to understand?  I saw this at my old institution outside of DIE.  Every so often a subpar support department would get new “managment”.  The new Director would make a big deal out of moving the “chairs about” in the organization—new organizational name, several shifts of staff, etc.—but in the end it was “same old, same old”!

The other piece that people consistently miss is that DIE isn’t about money, it’s about sending a message and implementing the ideology.
The pop culture commentators like Critical Drink, Nerdrotic, and their circles are constantly failing to realize this is the true purpose of DIE.
Those folks are always going, “Oh man, Disney/Marvel/Sony lost hundreds of millions on this films! This is great, so much winning!!! They’ll have to fire everyone and go bankrupt any day now!!!”
The funny thing is, “any day,” never seems to arrive.

        Unless and until Bloomberg writes an article saying that Fortune 500 companies are hiring White people again, I am unconvinced.Only White people are stupid enough to believe in the colorblind meritocracy. I assure you that the Asians and Indians who get hired under its tenets do not believe in it. They hire their own and look after them. Indians re-instate the caste system they left behind and take payoffs from H1Bs to stay on the job. There are a million stories about this on Reddit of all places, with the requisite “I’m not racist but…” disclaimers. This is without getting into the rampant cheating by them before they even step foot in an American office. I read an article about the scourge of fake doctors in India who run through a program in the motherland that is little more than a survey on Google Sheets. In the past, doctors and heart surgeons from the third world became taxi drivers here because we couldn’t trust their education. Now, we tell them to come over. This is what Rufo wants to bring to this country. Does he want his mixed race children to be treated by a fake Indian doctor who got hired through the colorblind meritocracy?

        “The reason for that is these are a necessary defense against lawsuits. Diversity programs are a defense against lawfare, which is as permanent as a government program.”
Oh, Lord;  You mean I have to keep looking at colored people in the LL Bean Catalogue forever?
I fear Z is right;  If the catalogue doesn’t show enough blacks camping and hiking, then Bean’s own DEI employees will make a fuss, sue and claim it’s evidence of the systemic racism of the business.  We will NEVER be rid of these folks.

            We used to shop at Cabelas when we lived in Texas (and when it was still Cabelas, not Bass Pro Shops).  Got their catalogue in the mail recently and it’s filled with blacks.  Didn’t buy a single thing from them for Christmas this year (I did buy a few jackets for my grandson on clearance a few months ago, but only after checking and confirming the prices were lower than Amazon had ever had them).

        Conservatives can demand colorblindness but when the browns fail then cons must explain why but they can’t because they can’t acknowledge racial differences.
How did the equality of the races become an article of faith? Most of our grandfathers accepted racial differences as obvious.
My guess is that we were unprepared for the ability of mass media to dictate morality. When almost all the owners of almost all the media push the same moral commandment, it creates an enforced consensus that was never possible before. Everyone, especially politicians, fear the wrath of the media.

        The corporate DEI programs are a protection racket intended to ward off the various shakedown operations run by the racial grievance industry.  Once they sensed they were no longer at risk of the Feds targeting them, they started dropping the programs.  There’s zero chance that companies like Netflix don’t know that their mandatory-gay-character rule in every Netflix show – and the whitewashing remake trend – is a sure money loser.  They want to push their agenda, but people are either switching off, or openly mocking the product.  “Wait for it…waaaait for it…BOOM!  There’s the gay character…episode 3.”Both outcomes are bad news.Where Trump can do the most good is through DOGE.  That’s where you can gut all this stuff from the government, particularly the military where DEI is a malignant cancer.

            I doubt they can do much of anything.  Reagan won big in 1980 (489-49) and a total landslide in 84(losing only Minnesota and DC). He had promised to get rid of the then brand new Dept of Education. He was unable to do so even with a gigantic mandate.  Reagan was not the loathed outsider Trump is.  They have lawsuits ready to go and file in leftist friendly courts. If nothning else, they can tie everything up in court for the next 4 years.  The Senate is already saying they will block his picks.

                I’ve rarely been disappointed by assuming the most cynical outcome possible when it comes to government.  I’d rather be pleasantly surprised than miserable.Reagan was 40 years ago.  I miss those times.  But Reagan hired “company men” and that never works out for change agents.  I am less cynical this time mainly because of all the outsiders Trump is nominating.  The GOP Senate is already caving on most nominees.  Because if the GOP can be counted on for anything, it’s folding like a cheap lawn chair.You can hear Trump’s growth as a leader in that Welker/retribution question last week.    He never said there wouldn’t be consequences.  He just said he wouldn’t order it.  If the AG sets up five grand juries and the FBI starts doing no-knock raids on Lawfare operatives, and Trump shrugs, then we’ll be making progress.i have three basic metrics that’ll tell me whether I can be cautiously optimistic:DeportationsDeclassificationsDismissalsDeescalationIf we see people getting kicked out in large numbers, declassification of various hoaxes, mass firings, and withdrawal from the various wars, I’ll start believing change is possible.

That being said, I think that guy in NYC should counter-sue the family and transit agency for allowing a deranged lunatic to wander the subways of NYC threatening passengers with death.
How hard would it be to convince a NY jury that we have a right to ride transit unmolested by lunatics?  I bet you couldn’t find a juror in NYC who hasn’t been terrified for their life at least half a dozen times due to the negligence of families and government.

            Trump can do the most good by persuading MAGA to accept surrender to the Russian empire when the time comes. Suppose that the Russians have transcended the wonder weapon curse and that NATO-Israel lack adequate defenses against the Russian wonder weapons. The Russians are completing the build up of their stockpile. Suppose next that they knock out the nuclear triad of Israel-NATO and neutralize the USS Gerald R. Ford and other carriers without damaging their reactors. Soon follows a demand for surrender.The cretins of the DC, Wall Street, and the City of London become virtually helpless. Their central banks, too, are destroyed. Their telecoms networks are being knocked out, which isolates them into manageable cauldons. Millions of brown saints in Western cities are on the verge of a great famine, which would result in some of the cretins dying like the French did in Haiti a few centuries ago. Supply chains fail throughout the West, esp. in the USA and Canada. The game is over in all but formal declaration, but there has still not been a nuclear war.The alternative to surrender, of course, is vast devastation, invasion, and a brutal massacre of the USA’s “Heritage” population of chauvinists, retards, and chumps. The Russians will still have their nukes, so they’ll have leverage which belligerent American flag wavers will not. It will be possible to establish beachheads in Nort America for landing men and equipment. They have a manpower issue, however, so anticipate recruitment of hundreds of thousands of Chinese, subsaharans, Latin Americans, and others. This gives the threatened invasion the appearance of a genocidal race war, as I think Dugin called for. Is this the right way to make “Heritage” America to sober up and to become humble? No. Trump can command American forces to surrender. (Whether or not they obey will be another matter.)Should Putin be replaced by a less tolerant man, Donald J. Trump can become the ultimate president of Philadelphia’s evil “Union” (Soyuz). The blob will howl in rage, but historians will hold DJT in high esteem for doing the right thing. There’s no need to die in bunker like Hitler while your people are exterminated like rodents in a barn.Surrender could come as soon as 2026, but probably is later. By 2033 a new Treaty of Paris can formalize the abolition of Publius’ USA, which is necessary in any case. The USS Constitution, by then war booty, will be flagged with the Russian tricolor and commence a victory tour with ports of call all over Asia, including at Edo Bay. Humiliating, yes, but remember the alternative. So you better visit her soon if you have any interest in doing so but have not set foot aboard her. World’s oldest commissioned naval warship, say the Wikipedians. Watch your head while below decks.The command module of Apollo 8, in Chicago for the time being, will also be booty. Trump, by giving in to a demand for surrender, can save the CM of Apollo 11, and other artifacts of accomplishment, for admiration by his posterity. Obstinate resistance, on the other hand, leads to the Ukrainian outcome for the Heritage. MAGA will be only Make Americans Go Away. In this scenario, the imperial government is destroyed, but the “States”, too, are eliminated.

                You’re massively overstating Russian capabilities. It’s been almost 3 years, and they’ve moved the front lines a couple hundred miles despite a shared border and completely unmolested logistics tails.  It’s probably the main evidence that Russia is not 1939 Germany.What Trump ought to do is flip the script on Russia. Pull out all our money and weapons and troops. Then, form a task force with Russia to investigate the cause of the war as well as who bombed the pipeline and financed the Moscow terror attack.This would include a full audit to identify publicly the Americans in government who benefitted financially from the Ukraine boondoggle.That would cause a freak out and purge like we’ve never seen…but desperately need.

                    You misunderstand the Russian offensive in Ukraine  You cannot overlay a WWII mindset there.  Russia has always had limited objectives rather than complete elimination of the Ukraine.  Also Putin is very casualty adverse.  Rather, he’s methodically grinding down Ukrainian military while sustaining minimal Russian casualties.  It also does not help when you need to replace your own material forces while the Uke’s get sent supplies and mission critical info from NATO on demand.  If Russia was balls to the wall here, you’d see much more direct attacks upon NATO.

                    they’ve moved the front lines a couple hundred miles despite a shared borderThat part of the conflict isn’t about wonder weapons but field guns, drones, tanks, and grunts in ditches and fox holes. The Russians and a few helpers are grinding down the male pop. of Ukraine to nothing. Ukrainian men who don’t flee or surrender are sent home cripples or as corpses or are blown to little bits in place for wildlife to consume. How would this picture be any worse for the Russian empire if NATO-Israel had its nuke triad destroyed? and if the Russians opened a front in NA to do here what they’re doing to the NATO proxy force in Ukraine?The slow pace of the Russian advance is partly a function of Russian leadership timidity, which is informed by the existence of Western nukes (and probably chemical and biological weapons). Russians are rightly afaid of attacking supply lines and sources west of Ukraine. What happens to this timidity should the First Use civilization have its nuclear fangs broken?If my resding of Russian intent is correct, they have proceded slowly partly because the wonder weapon solution hasn’t been ready, but they also know they can’t yet win a traditional land war against the West, which outnumbers Russians by more than 3 to 1. If the wonder weapon scenario plays out as I speculate, the West’s artillery production and grunt training facilities can be attacked with impunity, or nearly so. This begins to tip the grunt war decidedly in favor of the Rossiyans.What Trump ought to do is flip the script on Russia. Pull out all our money and weapons and troops.Some problems with that idea: Congress determines funding priorities, and Trump can’t rely upon the officer corps to obey his commands if they aren’t directly relevant to security of Judeo-Levitical supremacists or the American MIC. Breaking the USA’s triad will put its officer corps in grave peril of outright annihilation. This will reduce their propensity to disobey an order to surrender.Then, form a task force with Russia“bipartisan” or not? If so, then it’s compromised by the presence of two subversive factions, R and D, both perps motivated to cover their tracks. If not “bipartisan” then (i) only R or only D or (ii) neither R nor D. Whether R or D in (i), the excluded faction of the party will shriek and howl about bias, treason, and so on. If (ii), neither R nor D, then who? There is no second party. Trump has no such base of support, and even if he did, R and D would be attacking it harshly. So your “task force” will be impotent at birth, except to write a new fable of Russian perfidy.Probably I ought to have mentioned another development after the Russians develop the nerve and full capacity to carry out the plan to eliminate the NATO-Israel triad. First, the USA’s domestic nat gas pipelines will be destroyed. Then the gasoline pipelines, and oil pipelines. Result is uncomfortable winters for urban tenderfoots, and soaring energy costs for domestic industry. Ag production is then in grave danger, being dependent upon oil for fuel and fertlizers.As mentioned, the arsenals will be destroyed. The shipyards, too, are toast, assuming that the Russians can maintain a high rate of production of their wonder weapons and Israel-NATO develops no effective countermeasures stat. The merchant marine will be sunk. Important coastal bridges and wrecked. Elon Musk’s control center for Starlink will be eliminated, and orbital launch facilities in Florida, California, and the Pokomoke Peninsula are destroyed. Imports won’t make up the shortfall of oil and manufactured goods. Who will risk running the inevitable blockade? And why wouldn’t the Russians attack the docks?If the Russians have developed the ability to destroy the NATO-Israel triad, and if they do break the triad,thenthere will be a freak out. It will be too late to make any difference though. The USA will be finished, as will Israel and the vassal regimes of Europe.

                        Well said. This dovetails with my own thinking. I would just add that the destruction, either kinetically or through cyberattack, of EBT infrastructure will ensure that within 24 hours every ‘American’ city infested with African will have less law and order than Haiti. The chimping-out we have seen so far is just warmup because it has been done on full bellies.

        “Inclusion” in this case ultimately meant “exclusion.” Once a certain powerful group realized it would not be included despite past alleged unpleasantries and it would indeed be excluded due to its close resemblance to the Evil Ones, it was time to drop the curtain on DEI. Additionally, the military that primarily serves it has become hot garbage, and since we have to “fight them over there,” its white backbone needs to be lured back (it still won’t work). I knew it was drawing to a close when Jonathan Greenblatt suggested including Jews in DEI and Abe Foxman said it was all garbage and needed to end; Foxman at least has political skills and knows what is and what is not possible.The legal framework all hinges on GRIGGS, which judicially imposed “disparate impact.” Once the cucky justices realize it is safe to overturn GRIGGS and people will not call their wives racist, things change. In the meantime, as you point out, the changes will be mostly cosmetic, but to reiterate this will not stop the ridicule. Note that Trump did not offer Platinum Plans to The Holy this time, even if it remains early in the day. The Platinum Plan was a lightning rod for ridicule. Also, corporations have enjoyed unprecedented profit in recent decades and DEI is a luxury belief no matter how deeply embedded it is in an organization. At a minimum rocky economic times are lurking in the shadows and when those emerge costly items like LGBTQ sensitivity training sessions are discovered to have been successful enough to end.Finally, a shout out to Robin DeAngelo, Ibrahim Kendri, and the rest of a crew for a good run, which has a little more fuel in the tank. All things have to come to an end, but such a remarkable grift needs to be acknowledged.

        I think the mental hurdle is breaking the frame of our enemies. Thus, the way it plays out with these guys is

The key change in thinking is that normal White Americans finally understand that merit is, indeed, a racist concept.

        “…the DEI people say it is not enough to be not racist. You must be anti-racist, by which they mean creating an inclusive racial environment everywhere.”
In other words, one must promote “inclusion” (mediocrity), above “discrimination” (meritocracy).  This is the death knell for any advancing society.  The only questions remaining are how long will this take and what are the first signs of the inevitable decline?

        Another good piece.Two observations:First, how can DIE be bad publicity for corporations when their TV commercials, which are what the masses actually see of corporate AINO, are DIE in spades, so to speak? Logically, if the former proved to be a disability, then the latter are, too. And yet, so far as I know, ad campaigns are every bit as pro-negro/anti-white in 2024 as they were in 2014. When we begin seeing myriad ads for TGI Friday featuring tables and whole restaurants filled with whites enjoying one another’s company, I’ll believe the bad publicity argment. And I don’t think that’ll ever happen.Second, banning discrimination (against everybody but whites) is old hat for the Power Structure because it was accomplished roughly 40 years ago. Instead, the contemporary argument is that diversity is its own good, and that is the justification for the imposition of negro and sundry lesser pests upon the sites of hated whiteness. Inclusivity is good for you, whitey, so you’d better just sit down, shut up and get used to it.

Never say never. I don’t know if you or I will live to see such a thing, but I tend to believe at some point the wind shifts. We have a whole generation of Europeans who truly want to give away the store to anyone but their children. It seems doubtful that the children will feel the same way, once the resources run low or out.

        DEI and lawfare are societal entropy. It is productivity lost to parasitic friction. It can only exist in an environment of national affluence in which the losses are proportionally small. Just as the business cycle culls underperforming companies, a 4th turning is necessary to cull deadweight in a population. Some people believe that this cycle can be avoided forever. I don’t. The decline of the GAE means we can no longer keep the plates spinning by robbing resources and labor from the rest of the planet. Now is not a good time by be unfit or unproductive.

It’s apparent to me that we’re living out the philosophy of a particular generation that  they don’t need to worry about [x] bad thing, because they won’t live to see the consequences.  Unfortunately, there’s a whole bunch of other people that will be alive when the chickens finally come home to roost.

Courts can follow elections.  Elections can follow the populace. And the populace can be moved by half-measures and symbolism.

        The goal of, “a return to a colorblind meritocracy”, is impossible. This is because the, “colorblind”, part was always a figleaf to get the camel’s nose under the tent and up the dark orifice.Thus, the Civil Rights Regime is not about being colorblind. In fact, it is explicitly not colorblind. It is for all colors to the exclusion of White. The thing is now, that the racial polyglot is not just black and White, but all manner of shades of non-White. There is now open chatter, even amongst cowards and cucks that South Indians have created vast networks of nepotism within companies preferring their own in hiring and promotion. It is clear that East Asians do the same. I have witnessed East Asians teaming up against Whites to take over projects or sabotage them or an individual on it.Heck, CMU STEM is now run by South Asians. They wholly embrace DIE. Why? Not only is there no cost to them, there is benefit. They openly brag that they will recruit more “diversity”, and coddle it with special tutoring and hand holding … … Heck, they can use this to bring in more of their underperfomers at the expense of other ethnic groups. Definitely, Whitey will be last in line. I am sure other major institutions are similarly captured by anti-White incentivized ethnic enclaves.The path forward is what I have been saying for a while. You must have a tactic and a strategy. Both must account for the reality of greed, aversion to pain and aversion to inconvenience that the striver class has in heaps. The tactic is for Whites to exploit the letter and intent of the law. a) you shall not discriminate based on race, and b) fewer of X-Color means certain discrimination aka disparate impact.This means endless lawfare of Whites suing any and all institution that openly discriminates against them based on race. That has not gone away and it will not go away until Whites heed my advice/plan. This lawfare costs money and hits at greed and it is very inconvenient and creates pain for the practitioners of anti-White discrimination who are ubiquitous in the regime.Impose constant financial cost and inconvenience and pain. Then the strategic blow comes in. This will bring them to the table. The negotiation is simple: ‘We will not stop until the Civil Rights Regime is burned to the ground and the earth salted with its remains. You are very good at paying lawyers and bribery emissaries, (aka lobbyists), to write legislation and get it passed by the actors of Our Democracy – politicians in legislatures. We have written the repeal of the Civil Rights Regime for you. Use your machine to get it passed without exception and we will go away.’The Path of The Rufo is the path of weakness and DIE consolidating gains at the expense of more White people being dispossessed of optimal outcomes and opportunity.If White people are willing and show the resolve to do this, then the problem will get solved. Civil Rights Regime delende est!!!!Mars Exulti!

            I am reminded of the old mini series called “Storm of the Century” in which the demon, after piling Ossa upon Pelion on the citizenry of a small New England island, then demands that the citizens themselves select a child to be given to the demon. When they rightly refuse as loving parents, he says “give me what I want, and I’ll go away”, and in the end, a child is chosen by the whiteball/blackball method, and the demon leaves. There is no good outcome, only a series of more and more brutalities to be accepted and lived with.

        The civil rights framing perpetuates the myth that “diversity” is a political imposition on corporate-managerial life, that corporate politics forms as a more rational defense against a bigger, dumber, general politics. It’s more true—not exactly true—that “wokeness”/DEI/etc. is imposed on the government by business.No government anywhere, even Zimbabwe’s, is as anti-white as any Fortune 500 C suite. The anti-whiteness of the bureaucracy, like all its other characteristics, waslobbied into itby corporate America. It’s exemplary regulatory capture—that literally zero conservatives/libertarians identify as such.“Diversity” iscorporate discipline. If you seek its origin in academia you’ll find it not in scholarship—in “critical” whatever—but incampus administration.Hierarchy first, ideology to fit. Re-segregating the dormsprecededthe idea that minority students need a “space” that’s “safe” from whiteness. (If you were there you remember.) Etc.Point: “Normie” rightist identification with business, withbosses, renders them not only powerless to resist anti-whiteness, but obliges them to run cover for it. And without exception they do. Rufo is the worst of them, but even Jared Taylor blames the law (and ambient zaniness), not the people whobought it.

            Critical Legal Theory was the progenitor of Critical Race Theory and all other Critical Studies, and it most certainly spread from alleged scholarship to campus administration rather than the other way round, which is in fact usually the case. CLT preceded affirmative action and even aspects of desegregation, and the academicians who focused on it tended to be Leninists and were widely regarded as cranks as late as the early Nineties. While performative, Clinton refused to appoint the First Woman of Color legal academic Lani Guinier as assistant attorney general over her embrace of CLT and her suggestion that voting be weighted to disadvantage whites. Such would now be an enhancer.As for “(p)oint: “Normie” rightist identification with business, withbosses, renders them not only powerless to resist anti-whiteness, but obliges them to run cover for it,” yes, absolutely, amen, hallelujah. Con, Inc., is dying a well-deserved death because of this very reason. In this case, law follows culture rather than shapes it.

                Voting to be weighted to disadvantage whites, that’s been an obvious goal for a long time of where all this is headed. I’ve been wondering what its chances are, how many whites will go for it. I still think not all that many, just the usual 20%, and that’s decreasing because they are dying off. Certainly it won’t fly with Gen Z and younger, who do not live under the illusion of being in a white dominated society, question is will there be enough of them on a relative basis to stave it off.

            The normie Right’s identification with the bosses has always been a reason it fails to do much for the ordinary person (of any race). I think the reaction to the killing of that United Healthcare executive though, shows that ordinary Rightists are starting to get it – The Man is not your friend and never has been. He’s been right there holding hands with the Marxists and other Lefty trash undermining the country and the common man all along.

        One of the fundamental drivers of the system is the capitalist lust for cheap labor. Import a large, non-white laboring class and you inevitably get a demand to accommodate their interests, which in this case, means preferences in hiring vs. white Americans. The original rationale for the civil rights movement was to remove official discrimination against American blacks, who were themselves the product of a previous importation of cheap labor. This soon morphed into an assault on free association (even private association). At the same time, the same people who gave us the civil rights revolution also gave us the beginning of a Third World inundation, with all those non-whites now getting the benefit of the laws created to accommodate American blacks. There is no easy way out of this situation, as the capitalist have no intention of abandoning their cheap labor policies and the non-white population is now so enormous that there is no prospect for a legislative solution. Even if Trump had the will to do something about this (he doesn’t –  he won’t even expel the Dreamers), the practical problem is intractable.

                The capitalists don’t seem to realize that cheap labor will be the death of capitalism. The logical end to cheap labor is a society that exists only at a subsistence level that can’t afford the things they are producing. Then what? Everyone gradually slips back into serfdom?

        I don’t see it in retreat at all. A black schoolteacher is suing Beverly Hills School District for White teenage boys in her high school yelling “F Kamala” and waving Trump signs the day after the election.Disney is doubling down on Girl Bossing, Race Swapping, and gender bending on all its stuff, tv, movies, you name it. So is Amazon, Warners, Paramount, Sony, and Netflix.Jaguar is now a shirt company catering to a different sorty of “tranny enthusiast” if you take my meaning.Indeed the move is to neutralize any opposition to DEI by having Britain and France bring criminal charges for speech / opinions and extradite them. See Musk, world’s richest man and confidant of Trump. Sooner or later the UK will arrest him and jail him.Then there is Trump — Merchan may very well jail him for 30 years before he is inaugurated, and Tish James is promising more prosecutions.The Woke Dream is alive and well. Assad’s fall “proves” that Regime Change always works, we just need bribes and Special Forces Olympics, the days of industrial warfare are gone forever, etc. Biden just pardoned 39 people including Chinese spies and a Chinese man found with child icko. [You know what I mean].

            Then there is Trump — Merchan may very well jail him for 30 years before he is inaugurated, and Tish James is promising more prosecutions.Remember the people who smothered campus activists for defying them. They won’t tolerate Merchan throwing the USA into chaos by jailing Trump before inauguration. That other little country and its nation come first, certainly before the factional and racial enmity of the D’s. So Leticia James, too, is blowing smoke. Trump is safe for the time being. The situation after midterms however could be vastly different, depending upon what the Russians are planning to do with their growing collection of wonder weapons.

My fear is that Trump will be more or less another Reagan and just keep them at bay for another few years until they regroup. But obviously things are different demographically now, before we even get into foreign policy and finance.

        I love your articles.  You present analyses that never would cross my mind and allow me to look at the world more comprehensively.  Thank you for your blog. It is usually in the top 2-3 things I read first in the morning. However, today’s article , imho, is a bit far-fetched.  I am reluctant to state that  conservatives had any confidence prior to the election.  There was nothing that would lead me to believe that a positive result was coming on November 5.  But as the saying goes, Hope is a virtue and through God’s grace, the results worked out in the good guys’ favor.

        Maybe related, maybe not: I think they are getting a rude awakening from each and every direction. Many normies on the right are beside themselves about how so many of us are laughing about Luigi Mangione taking out the UHC CEO and some of us as gleeful about it as people on the left.They really shouldn’t be surprised since this country was founded by spilling blood. Gouging people on healthcare without giving them a choice in the matter is not really that much different from “taxation without representation.” (And let’s not forget that all their cronies got waivers. The ones without lobbyists get stuck with the tab.)

                I think it’s a lot like foreign policy. If we don’t like something, they automatically like it even when they really don’t. Like the all the vitriol against Russia these days. The left loved Russia when they were commies. Now that many of us like them because they are Christian and traditionalists, not to mention that we’re not exactly living up to our ideals we purport to have, they mimic the anti-russia propaganda.I had one lefty complaining about how he’s healthy and how ridiculous it is that it costs him $1,100 a month for insurance. Unlike my insurance, which is high deductible crap insurance at $800 a month, he actually gets something out of his policy. But even he thinks what he pays for his ridiculous … $13,200 a year.
