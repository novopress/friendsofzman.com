        Freedom of speech, yeah, that was from, like, a hundred years ago.
You have the freedom to say non-triggering, non-discriminatory things.  I would say “have a nice day”, but that would be triggering and discriminatory to the nocturnal depressives out there.

        The word ‘Harmful’ tells you all you need to know, and allied with ‘Digital’ somehow doubles the impact.
Meanwhile, there are people doing real harm wandering around and the nearest they get to digital is sticking a fistful of bunched digits in another’s face. Happily the weeping snowflakes demand they are ‘protected’ by the law. But as for you…
