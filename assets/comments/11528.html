                Doubtful. How many of our kind will tune out,I am betting too few.
This piece today doesn’t inspire me, me just being some sort of low level, non descript chronicler. As the Derb says, we are doomed.

                    The ratings year over year say you’re just dead wrong.  There are surveys (reported as late as last week) which say that upwards of 30-35% of viewers who have tuned out of the NFL in the last 2 years (viewership is down double-digits) have done so specifically because of this “kneeling” crap.Expect those ratings to decline further.  I have friends on social media calling DirecTV to cancel their Sunday Ticket today, giving out the phone number and encouraging others to do the same.The problem the NFL has is that the people who either a) agree or b) don’t care, cannot buy more tickets, buy enough merchandise, or “watch TV more”.As Michael Jordan reportedly said, “Republicans buy sneakers too.”

                    I was wondering how the NFL would respond if a Jewish player took the Koran out onto the field and stomped it to raise awareness of how Israel is the constant target of Arabs and Muslims.
Oh who am I kidding,  I know what would happen.  The player would be heavily fined, suspended and probably blackballed from the league.

                        When asked about his player who went out and honored the country, Steelers’ coach Mike Tomlin said, “I was looking for 100 percent participation. We were gonna be respectful of our football team.”
In other words, Football Team &gt;&gt; Country.
Notice also that it was the coach expecting 100% participation.

                There’s only a 15 yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for taunting other players.  Do it twice, and you get ejected.
However, you can taunt the fans, the police who protect you on the field, and the military and veterans around the world all you like.

            I’ve heard from friends today canceling their NFL Sunday Ticket, and refusing to watch the games at all.  Only ONE Steeler (Villanueva, former Army Ranger) came out of the locker room for the National Anthem.  Idiot coach said he wasn’t going to be a part of “divisiveness”.  How about that for cowardice?I’m not the only person to notice that “divisive” always and everywhere means you’re a regular American who loves their country, expects the laws to be obeyed, and demands a little damned respect for the people who defend the country from despotism.  And that includes our brave police officers, who are daily slandered by these overpaid ass hats.

                Haven’t watched a game this season.  And am the demographic the NFL craves.  Usually drop a few k on good tix to specific games, won’t this year.  Have turned down offers of tickets for business–and specifically mention why–that eventually gets to the folks making the decision to spend the money on boxes.  Just done with these fools.  They are free to protest, and also free to crap in their own nest.  I just don’t have to finance it.

        Is certainly a downer post.  I think we’ll get our revolution before our totalitarianism but it’s chilling how one fate or the other seems inevitable in my life…perhaps quite soon.
One thing that’s particulary scary is how the normal rational binds don’t apply.  Blind Freddie can see how politically suicidal the poz is.  Self interest doesn’t stop antifa torpedoing the political legitimacy of the left.  Profit motive doesn’t stop Google and Twitter self immolating.
Nothing proves the religious basis of progs better than that.

        Keeping a record is all that can be done.Sounds like our esteemed host has taken a dose of the black pill today. Understandably so given the current circumstances.I’ll just make one comment in connection with the references to Cicero and the fall of the Roman Republic. While from the point of view of our reading his speeches and letters from the final months after the assassination of Caesar, it may look like all he was doing was leaving a record for posterity of the demise of the Republic, what he was doing at the time was very actively attempting to rally the forces of freedom against the threat of impending tyranny and oppression. He wasn’t a military type himself, but he was doing his utmost to rally support for decisive action from both the available military leaders and the general public.And that’s what you can do with this blog. As someone else is reported to have said, “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.” And that is to fight the good fight (whether by sword or pen)!And if they wind up nailing your head and keyboard to the rostra, I’ll be chief among your mourners.

            and he (Cicero) failed utterly, because he was fighting the tidal pull of history.   the great men of history are surfers, not wave makers.  and the key to being a good surfer, is knowing where to be when the big wave arrives.
Zman is just bummed because he lives in Baltimore, and who wouldn’t be.

            This piece did invoke the “Black Pill Blues.” Not that I disagree, I’m a black-pilled kind of gal. This ship is heading for the ocean floor, one way or another. keeping record of that decline seems imminently respectable.The only hope I hold is for the rebuild from the ashes, which is the only hope that seems sane to me, frankly.

            Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears –I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them;The good is oft interred with their bones;So let it be with Caesar.The noble Brutus hath told you that Caesar was ambitious:  If it were so, it was a grievous fault,And grievously hath Caesar paid for it.Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest–For Brutus is an honorable man;So are they all, all honorable men–Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:But Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honorable man.He [Caesar] hath brought many captives home to Rome, whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honorable man.You all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented Caesar a kingly crown,Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And, sure, he is an honorable man.I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,But here I am to speak what I do know.You all did love him once, not without cause:What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,And I must pause till it come back to me.~~~And so it goes.  Tyrants will *always* tell you that those they just murdered were the “”Real Tyrants”” , the real threat to your safety and happiness.  And of course they will claim it as a selfless act, that they killed the alleged tyrant “for the people” and not for their own ambition.  That’s exactly why we were all required to read and recite this particular speech in high-school english class.My understanding is that ‘Julius Caesar’ and in fact all of Shakespeare has been deprecated out of the FUSA public indoctrination program.  It’s no wonder, given that the Brutus’es and Mark Antony’s are gathering – like a murder of crows – to commit the greatest act of patricide ever committed: the murder of an entire civilization.  The murder of that civilization which has sired and nurtured all of the worlds science, technology, art, and philanthropy.  The murder of the *only* civilization ever to teach that men have both the right and obligation to choose their own way in the world, and to make that way upon their own merits, for better or for worse.Hillary and 0bama accuse white Westerners of being disastrously ambitious; yet the bloody knives are in their hands.But all things turn, and soon enough shall come the cries of “out! Damn spot”.  Hell is murkey, indeed.

        Can you remember that smarmy kid who was so keen on being class president of the student government back in high school? Those are the people who became the political class you see today. Their behavior does not surprise me in the least.
I find it telling that they can’t compete with the popular kid though when he decided to run.
Of course most other kids realized the principal ran everything anyway and it was a sham bullshit suckup job and there were more important things to do.

        A good post and perhaps a good indicator of where we stand in the generational cycles and the rhyme of history. Yes, it was depressing but honest examination is far more valuable than deluding oneself into believing everything is OK.I’m of the opinion that all politicians are self-serving at best and a significant portion are sociopaths. How many politicians say one thing on the campaign trail and do the exact opposite once in office? The US Congress is exempted from insider trading laws and the critters are unashamed in profiting from their information. The sad part is that Congress has an approval rating in the teens but 90-some percent get re-elected. IMO the next election will determine whether the ballot box will be able to fix anything; I’m not optimistic about the results. Local party organizations are designed to keep outsiders/populists out never mind third parties or independents who are often required to go through a ridiculous petition process to even get on the ballot.Slightly OT, but it has been mentioned in other comments: I’m done with the NFL. Millionaires, who would otherwise be dope-slingers or dependants of the state, want to protest and get their “message” out is fine; they do have their “right” to do so just like I have the right to move on. I will also do my best to buy absolutely nothing from anyone that sponsors the NFL. Maybe some day, they and the Hollywierd types will realize that they’re there to entertain and we don’t give a flying f*** about their opinions. As the cliche goes, “opinions are like a**holes; everyone has one.”

        I don’t think things are a bleak as they appear currently. Our politics is locked into kick-the-can-down-the-road and leave the problems for the next guy. This is suicide in slow motion and makes the eventual bottom ever deeper. Far better is to crash quickly and then begin rebuilding right away while there are still enough able-bodied producers to make a difference. If we go through another decade of degeneracy, the rebuild option may no longer be viable. Keep cool, turn off the TV, and buy another case of ammo. The goal should be to win the rebound, not try to slow the inevitable decline.

            In about twenty-five years the whites will be in the minority in the U.S.A.  Their non-white replacements are largely undesirables from third-world dumps.  That is very unlikely to end well, regardless of what RINO Ryan may say from his fortress in Wisconsin.

                    Starving people don’t fight revolutions, pissed off people do.Right now we are still working the electoral system, primary elections and the like in hopes of a repair and are starting the slow process of divesting ourselves of the old rotten cultural institutions like the NFLAfterwards we can consider what to do, what to build (we need our own institutions)  and than start working to that end.if the system fails to accommodate  weapons, ammo and the like are plentiful, if the Left pushes too hard in retaliation the sameAnd note too the level of civil disobedience re; gun registration is extreme . Connecticut has draconian laws on semi auto rifle registration (felony level) and for a brief period in 2013  threatened to search door to doorThe response from gun owners was to dox the people passed the bill and still not comply (its about 10% or so compliance)Other states are even rowdier which suggests a significant population that is far from cucked or weak.That’s Connecticut, I can’t

        Too soon for defeatism, Z. The game is not over – and Trump was just the opening salvo in this culture war. The left responded with the usual accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.And Antifa. PBBFBFBFFFFFT!And – Whitey isn’t sitting on the couch anymore. He’s not shutting up when he’s told to either. Free speech is alive and well and always will be. Their narrative is collapsing, and don’t be surprised if you see some fuggin vibrant getting shot as he tries to pull down a statue in the near future. Barack Obama sold more AR15’s than the NRA did. Nor did he sell them to sportsmen and enthusiasts – they were bought by grim faced men who would have dearly loved to spend the money on something else – but they don’t trust their govt to protect them. The mood in some areas is murderous. I’ve grown up in a liberal environment, working for inferior people, being scolded, admonished and abused by them. I’ve had enough. As you note the narrative has descended into lunacy.The ball is still in play boys, and it’s in OUR court. We need to keep it that way. Those prog morons are scared shitless and we need to keep it that way.

        “The broad appeal of populist polices on trade, taxes and social issues should have resulted in a wave of populist politicians. …. Imagine a polished professional running on the same issues as Trump. Yet, we don’t see anyone picking up on these issues”You’re working on the assumption such people are welcome in the political process. They are most assuredly not, hence their the absence of populists on the political scene.Perot and Trump showed that outsiders/populists are not only not wanted but despised by the political class.As Carlin pointed out.”the game is rigged”. The response to Trump shows that in spades.  Even as he moderates himself, he is still totally detested by his own party that is willing destroy itself to prevent any of his agenda from being implemented.The only way to fix it, is to bring entire rotting facade down. Either by a war that goes bad or having stock market bubble collapse.That said, I do wonder if Trump’s goading of North Korea into a fight is his way of blowing up the existing global order and bringing down the house so to speak.  I wouldn’t blame Trump given the way cloud people have attacked his family and associates.

            “The fraudulent uniparty has earned the hatred of both sides. Their platform will in time collapse in proportion to the corruption exposed.”I wish this were true.Their corruption has been exposed, but exposed by deplorables and other disrespected individuals. Even if more people now get their news from the internet, there are still “sources of record” that will always deny the corruption and try to substitute a narrative that fits their needs. And who will prosecute the corruption? Comey, Rice, and Wasserman-Schultz are still free. Mueller is doing his damage. While the gay mulatto’s dindu’s are no longer in the top Executive Branch posts, the next level down, the level that actually takes care of business, has been packed with those that will never prosecute. Oh, they may occasionally sacrifice one of their own so they can be wrapped in the cloak of righteousness, but it will a low-level functionary that will serve as a warning to their friends. And even then, they will get a suspended sentence and a sinecure in academia.My concern is that even if a record is made, I don’t think mankind will learn from it. Whites have created civilizations that reached the heights of contemporary civilization before and have lost them. The records are there. Dark Ages have come and gone and been replaced by even more glory. The only thing that will stop this from happening will be if White genes become extinct. I believe this will never happen, but I have no delusion that Whites will achieve the necessary wisdom to admit how precious those genes are and the ruthlessness to protect them. Whites could colonize Mars or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, but unless they enforce racial segregation they will continue to cycle back and forth between greatness and slavery. Whites’ desire to help and dominate others and be thanked for it will always be the chink in the armor that leads to opening Pandora’s box.

                Personally, I’m glad the criminals aren’t getting prosecuted. There is  nothing better to show the American people as proof of the rot in this country than just pointing to them as Exhibit A. We all know they should be thrown to the lions, and their continued freedom from justice only serves to wake up more and more sleeping Americans who may not follow politics closely, but understand “fairness,” and “justice.”I think it may be our only hope, at this point.

                When people fail to see “what’s in it for me” from the Uniparty, the Uniparty will quickly fall.  Interesting how the Donks’ fund raising is collapsing.  Potential donors don’t see anything in it for them.  Maybe they only donated in the past to buy themselves some political favors, but even that seems to be disappearing quickly now.

        Keeping the record will do two things in the event we have a second civil war.   Since the regressives will ultimately end up losing such a war,   history will have a good record of what led to it.  Show liberalism and the regressives that ran it obviously suffer from mental disease and to help future generations snuff that crap out before it takes root again.    Secondly it will be needed as evidence after the civil war is over to try, convict and execute the leaders of that cult that dragged the US down into that war.

        Perhaps the ruling class is anything but suicidal. Sure, there are the true believers, but the political class may be no better than well-starched preppers: they know the walls are crumbling and they just need to hold on long enough to get the shelter stocked.

        I think Cicero liked the republic, but knew it was coming to an end. I also think he knew that some sort of dictatorship would be necessary, at least for a while. Rome had had them in the past and had returned to republican government after a while. It wasn’t quite the either or type of situation many seem to think it was.That said, Cicero miscalculated a couple of times. First time he backed Pompey over Julius. After Julius was killed his error was in assuming that Anthony and Octavian would fight it out and he backed Octavian. Unfortunately for him Octavian and Anthony participated in a triumvirate and Octavian didn’t object when Anthony wanted Cicero on the list of those proscribed.Cicero was right about the future dictatorship of Octavian (Augustus), but wrong in how it would come about, and wrong in thinking it would be temporary. My guess is that if Pompey had won out over Julius his dictatorship would not have been temporary, either.As it ended up, the rule of Augustus was pretty darned good. And if he had engaged in the kind of succession that the good emperors did later on in adopting heirs and naming successors, his system would have done better, too.Now take all of the above into account and put that next to the statement about our current senators and congresscritters being insane. And take a look at our career civil servants.A dictatorship and ten thousand or so proscriptions might just be what the teapartydoc ordered.

        you wrote:“Politicians are cautious by nature, which means they live in fear of being on the wrong side of voters. Yet on this and other issues, they boast about giving their voters the bird. It’s tempting to say they are bought by moneyed interests, but this looks more like insanity than corruption. Our political class is suicidal…..The broad appeal of populist polices on trade, taxes and social issues should have resulted in a wave of populist politicians. ….. Yet, we don’t see anyone picking up on these issues. It’s as if the entire political class has been infected with a virus that makes them act against their own interests, by alienating their own voters.”===========my response:very good observation…but your conclusion is wrong…human beings operate according to the rules of the subculture in which they like…these politicians live in the upper class subculture…and in the upper class subculture nonwhites are revered and the white working class is scum…this is nothing new….for hundreds of years the american upper class has loved nonwhites/immigrants and hated the white working class…why? MONEY….money, honey….the white working class democratically and physically (with the power of the fist and the rope) dominated america up until about 50-60 years ago….for most of american history the white working class had a great deal of solidarity and so therefore they were able to control their own government to a great degree and thus prevent nonwhites from lowering wages too much….however, the upper class, bought labor..they are Capital….the white working class sold labor…they were Labor…Labor vs Capital…that has been the struggle, and that will always be the struggle….that struggle is still ongoing…trump vs the establishment is simply another manifestation of Labor vs Capital…the media/establishment is trying to keep the white populist dissidents from understanding this…and so far they are succeeding in this goal…now, the upper class has always seen nonwhites as a profit center because nonwhites represent cheap labor…the white working class, with their democratic control of the government, especially local governments, had to some degree been able to suppress the wage-lowering effects of nonwhite labor….also, the white working class, in the past, was able to put physical fear into nonwhites and thus keep them out of white neighborhoods and workplaces….nonwhites knew that they would be beaten or killed if they tried to infiltrate white neighborhoods and workplaces..this was the power of the fist and of the rope….whites would beat or lynch nonwhite intruders…and the white working class controlled the local governments….for most of american history the federal government was not strong enough, not well funded enough, to stop the white working class and their local governments from enforcing the will of the white working class at the local level…so nonwhites stayed out of white areas…they were forced to by the power of the fist and the rope…this de facto segregation, combined with legal segregation in many places, allowed whites to keep nonwhites away from many vocations and locations, thus propping up wages…But this regime came to a stop starting in the 1950s and 1960s…after that the upper class subculture came to dominate america, and that domination is why the politicians are not adopting populism a la trump…the upper class subculture sees whites as demons and nonwhites as angels…if these politicians are voted out of office by the white working class for lack of populist appeal, these politicians will then be well taken care of by the upper class if they conform to the rules of that upper class subculture…but only if while in office the politicians adhere to the mores and rules of that upper class subculture…if they follow trump they will NOT be well taken when out of office….why? Because the media will demonize them…but if they adhere to these rules, they will be given seats on corporate boards of directors, cush jobs in think tanks etc…this is the payoff for doing what the upper class wants….and if white political dissident realized this, that this struggle is just Labor vs Capital all over again, we could win over enough white liberals to our side….but white political dissidents cannot see the forest for the trees…unfortunately…

        It’s actually pretty simple. A (((tribe))) has slowly lied, cheated and stole the rights to print all the world’s money. They use their infinite financial resources to “fix the world” into an image that is most beneficial to them. Now they are entering the final stages and trying to fold all the nations of the world into one giant communist superstate. Western politicians are promised a place in the coming superstate if they help destroy their current nation.

        Ah, the “Dark Ages” myth again!!For a guy who is clearly anti-Establishment, you certainly admire “Establishment” Rome (which was not even the capital of the Empire when Alaric took it down).  Why do you think (along with such ‘greats’ as Rousseau) that the only smart guys on Earth lived in Rome?  Hell, there was a town near Stockholm which, in AD250 was turning out tools and machinery traded all over the world.Alaric was a Legion Commander and most of his troops were Roman Army veterans.  The Benedictines, who were spread all over Europe, created centers of scientific and cultural learning which rivaled or exceeded those of Rome before the Fall.Nothing like patented Establishment myths–but they should be told by the Bush/Schumer/NBCCBSCNNABC fools, not someone like you!

        The usual date given for the fall of Rome is 475 AD.The death of Cicero occurred in 43 BC.You say: “They understood that when Rome fell, the West was plunged into an intellectual, economic and cultural darkness.”It may be true that some of the founders were interested in the fall of Rome.  It’s not at all obvious that the event occurring during the life of Cicero,  500 years earlier ,had anything to do with the fall.The reign of Augustus and the events leading to the end of the Republic sit almost exactly in the 100 year middle point of Roman history.  It’s tendentious to claim the transition brought about the fall.It would be like looking to the writings of Francis Bacon (22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626) to explain America’s situation in 2017.

            Read a little Cicero and you won’t be making these comments. The Roman Republic existed in form only by Cicero’s time. That was exactly his lament. They crossed the form line with the proclamation of Julius Caesar to be dictator in perpetuity. We are at the republic  in form only stage. The Deep State rules.

        “Trump is a terrible politician and his many quirks make him ill-suited for politics. ”
He confirms that by his asinine remarks about the NFL “kneelers”.
Another gratuitous gift to the other side.
(Yes, the first kneeler should have been suspended, at least, but it’s extremely unPresidential and pisspoor politics to say what he said this week.)

            So, you prefer the pronouncements of career politicians over anything authentic? Face it, Trump, was not a politician during the election. He is becoming one, unfortunately. But, I prefer someone speaking the truth rather than someone speaking in abstract platitudes with “dignity” and “restraint”. I wouldn’t have hated B. J. Clinton as much if he had said “Hell, yeah, I inhaled. Then I drank the bong water. What about it?” Instead, I knew he was a liar of Machiavellian proportions.  Pompous pseudo “dignity” and “respect” helped propel us into ever deeper circles of hell. I say, let’s get more absurdities in office, like Kid Rock so we can tell the DemonicRats and the cucks to go fuck themselves. When your opponents are incapable of “dignity”, “restraint”, or politeness, just laugh at them, trigger them, and bitch slap them.

                It’s simple. Trump’s comments show some simple respect for the opinions of the average American.  Those of his opponents tell the average American to F*** off.
Villanueva of the Steelers is going to be a rock star, whether he wants it or not.  He will never buy his own drinks or dinner again.

                The brilliant thing about it is it forced basically every human being running the NFL to publicly take a side.  Predictably all did with the players.
Watch the ratings tumble now that sides have officially been chosen.

            Why should some spectator sport run by a bunch of oligarchs be off limits to criticism when you have black players who are on the clock giving the finger to the flag and country?And what did Goodell do? He doubled down and supported disrespecting the flag and country.  The guy is a moron.  The NFL attendance and viewership are already down and he’s telling the players they can do as they please. Not good.Besides to Trump’s base, it’s red meat.I think Trump wanted to rattle some cages and did it with this. Look Trump is pretty much locked up in the White House. Congress won’t do squat for him, the GOP is willing to commit suicide to make sure none of his agenda is implemented. The DOJ and the AG are flat out refusing to prosecute anyone except pot growers.

                    He’s the commander in chief.  Good for Trump for standing up and giving voice to the tens of millions of Americans who are told to sit down and STFU over this stuff.  I grew up in a family that has had nearly a dozen of us serving in uniform from uncles to cousins to my immediate family, myself, my wife, my dad, and so on.This stuff the NFL is pulling is a big old “F**K  YOU” to people like me.This is like Trump’s rallies last year.  The media literally have NO IDEA how popular his comments are, and if they discover it in polling, they will just publish some fake polls.  Worked out great for President Hillary, after all.

                That the fans hate Goddell for a host of other reasons isn’t going to help the league recover any time soon.

            Guess again.  The NFL has decided to self-immolate over these overpaid entertainers.  Or, “slaves”, as I believe they call themselves. lolIt’s not just the NFL that’s gonna take it on the chin.  Last weekend I watched the Broncos game with my family.  We spend about $50bucks on pizza, wings, and drinks.Today, as I walk away from the NFL perhaps for good, I made a sandwich with leftovers from the fridge and spent an hour throwing the football in the back yard with my son (as we do every Sunday).This is far from over.  Fans who woke up this morning to see a bunch of traitors kneeling in a foreign country in protest of whatever the f**k it is they are even protesting…that pissed  people off like you have no idea.  Then the Steelers wouldn’t even take the field……except for their US Army Ranger Veteran (Villanueva).They want a war, they got one.

            One other thing about the Trump sports day the other day.  Check this out:
U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain’t going! So therefore ain’t no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!
That is from a dude who puts a ball in a hoop to the president of the United States of America.
And the man in the television has the unmitigated gall to tell me Donald Trump has destroyed America’s institutions.
There’s nothing left to destroy; it’s already anarchy out there.
