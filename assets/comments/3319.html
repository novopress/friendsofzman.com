        You are right about the N-S  divide being not as strong, but my sense of things (and I have spent my whole life in the North, mostly in elite outposts). However, and I ask the questions- is it possible that the elites- the rich billionaires, journalists and academics are not as strong there? My sense of things is there are more what I like to call normal people there? Anyone with more experience than mine have an opinion?

        Looking at the video, the cop has his right arm under the guy’s right arm. That ain’t the way they taught me to do the “choke hold” in boot camp. It’s not really a choke hold, anyhow. The idea is to cut off blood flow to the brain. Hold it just long enough for them to go limp, they wake up soon. Hold it a bit too long, they don’t wake up at all.We practiced it on each other several times, trading positions. The cops need to do that too. They could use Gitmo prisoners to practice on. That way, if they lost a few, who would care?

        Tobacco is government’s biggest cash crop. Has there ever been anything like it?
================
Well, back in the 19th century, the British government in India made lots of money off sales of Indian opium in China. Even went to war with the Chinese government when it tried to stop it.

        This is primarily about the challenge to authority. There is nothing more infuriating to a cop or a government than to be told that they have no business poking around and touching everything.

        it must be galling for the Left that — after such concerted effort, all the trouble created with the unquestioning support of a compliant main-stream media — to see that their determined efforts to claw more money and power for the elite is grinding to a halt.Following the collapse of communism in most of the world, and numerous trembles in the few remaining outposts of Marxist dogma since, the Left resolutely soldiered on, believing in the face of all evidence that their ‘message’ would still make them stronger and richer. But that window of opportunity was broken a long time ago and now even the dogmatic among them are finally grasping the game is up. The Left still tries, as it will, to keep on keeping on in the hope of a few more thousand impressionable young and a few million disaffected welfare recipients will do enough stirring and destruction to make sure the elite can stay where they dream of being.But their time is up. The internet — which the Left has never fully understood as it has no ‘ elected leader’ and answers to no ‘approved agenda’ — has become the voice of ordinary people who are tired of all this crap. Once people realised that there is more to society than the Left pumping itself up and grabbing all that they can while directing ‘revolutionaries’ to burn down businesses and destroy cities, the Left were done for.They will return in time, if only because the enemies of progress and security will still beaver away in the dark places, but for now they are facing the harsh reality of discovering their lies and games are running on empty.

        I think you are correct.  The “silent majority” is starting to make its voice heard through elections, not looting in the streets. The right will win the presidency in the next election and then the big task will be to make those elected pols do what they said they would do.  The “tea party” types will rise to leadership positions and the pendulum swing will be complete.  Seen it before, will see it again.
