        I dropped my subscription in 2005 after more than 20 years. Their drift leftward with Lowry was remarkably quick.

        You speak the truth.  I quit when Derbyshire got axed.  VDH is not worth it and I don’t know Williamson and won’t get to.  Lowry is a girlyman.  I used to hear him on Laura Ingrham who I’ve also quit.  The only radio show worth my time now is the quintessentially irreverent Walton and Johnson and, like Grace, I came here from AD.

        Lowry’s problem, and his attraction to TV, is the fact that online print is losing its economics and Lowry, et al., are looking for new fields on TV where the money is. They are all whores so forget principle and will suck up to whoever is running the network.

I stopped my National Review subscription of many years in 2009.  I still view online, but I agree with you.  I find I read Williamson, VDH, McCarthy, but not many others.
