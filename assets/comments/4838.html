        ‘Christianity’ is simply man’s attempt to live out the Bible.  We often err in this endeavor for myriad reasons and much of Christendom is flawed (including but not limited to most Evangelical denominations), but I wouldn’t throw the baby out with the bath water.  Humanity is inherently flawed and therefore our pursuits are prone to failure.  However I would posit it is inadvisable to dismiss Christianity because its proclaimed followers/believers err.The Bible is self-contained and self-explanatory (at least for those major doctrines which concern our mortal life).  It is the road map provided by the Creator who wishes to interact with his creation.  Many flavors of Christianity have corrupted this with their interpretations, agendas, etc.  However if we examine the core of what is contained in that text, we find the only rational and logical moral code which fills the spiritual void all humanity must satisfy. To deny the existence of Christ as God ultimately leads humanity to worship itself.  To fill that spiritual void with any other deity leaves us unfulfilled.  To know God exists requires interaction; ‘proof’ if you will.  That is what the Bible explains to us; how to interact with our Creator.So I encourage you to not be disenfranchised in your faith by the failures of humanity to represent God.  He needs no representatives.  Ditch the intermediaries and find God directly through you’re own experience. There’s more to this life than what we see and can explain.Enjoy your posts and thought provoking essays.

        In my wife’s (not) denomination, almost all hymns sung were written between 1750 and 1930. Jesus was nobody’s boyfriend in those centuries. Yes, God is love, but not on our terms.

            There’s something to be said for hymns with real theology. Otherwise, why bother singing?

        Old fashioned Christianity is hard. Who wants to suffer for his sins and be redeemed? It’s more fun to go to a Madonna concert or get high, or both. There is a correlation between this easiness and the loss of valor. Who wants to stand and fight? Those bad guys will go away or be killed by Arnold S., just like on television. I don’t like where this leads logically, so I’ll stop here.

        Joel Osteen will not  be “pointing out passages in the Bible…” He never uses Scripture and is entirely prosperity Gospel.  Also, notice the lack of a cross and any concept of suffering for your  faith

        “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” is one of my favorite books, and Philip K. Dick is one of my favorite authors. He was very hit and miss but when he hit, he communicated profound insight into the human condition.Mercer promised that with him, you would never be alone. And that’s it. You would suffer with Mercer, experience death again and again, but you would never be defeated. Mercer never won, but death never won either, and that was Mercer’s victory.Jesus is truth and love. Truth without love is bitterly harsh, and love without truth is a lie. Modern Christianity tends to be just love. But the truth, however harsh, is a kind of love all its own, and people will come to regret the lies they have chosen to believe.
