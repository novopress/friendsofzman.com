        Most commercial satellites of the world are launched from French Guiana on Ariane 5 rockets, the US launch market is dominated by the Military Industrial Complex.

        The Declaration is sex, not marriage.  The Constitution was written, argued, opposed, and ratified by men sobered by the true nature of the circumstances which they themselves had created.
The Constitution could not withstand the grasp of Visionary and Utopian thinkers over time because those opposed, who were granted their 10 amendments, did not think to make the 10th Amendment the 1st, and specifically grant States the right to secede.
It did last 72 years, which is not nothing. Now the Constitution is just sex, with the taxpayer over the barrel.

        ….”That’s the central issue with libertarianism in general and techno-libertarianism in particular. The only way it can work is if a benevolent dictator makes sure the people don’t do something stupid like vote for state provision of public goods….”But people will ALWAYS do dumb things and the more “ambitious” amongst us, will use this human foible to amass power and authority.  And these “more ambitious” individuals will almost never be benevolent.Folks who “think” like a  George Washington or a James Madison no longer bother to seek office; they realize that our present system is IRREVOCABLY BROKEN – IT CANNOT BE FIXED. It simply must be dismantled.The solution is to have competing states within a very weak Federal system as ORIGINALLY intended in the US Constitution.Yes, some states WILL become autocratic, but others will not. This will allow people to physically get up and relocate to those states they find most appealing.When states realize that the citizenry can “escape” their clutches, it will force most of them – but not all – to establish a system of government exists to serve the people.Presently, regardless of which state one chooses to reside in, the Federal TYRANNY,  the Federal DICTATORSHIP, will follow you like your shadow. You cannot escape its clutches.If a state’s Constitutional Convention is not convened to amend the Constitution, then the states must begin the process of secession.Secession to pursue individual liberty and freedom is noble and virtuous, and conforms with the spirit of our own Declaration of Independence.

        I thought I was clear that I have no animus for Musk, despite his silly name. From what I can tell, he came about his money legally and, for the most part, honestly. Calling him a great inventor or entrepreneur seems like an abuse of language to me. Like Steve Jobs, Musk’s primary skill was in getting just ahead of a fad and cashing in on it.SpaceX could prove to be an exception, but it could also prove to be a huge flop. Satellite launching services have been around a while now. SpaceX is hardly breaking new ground here.Again, it is clever marketing more than anything. International Launch Services has been putting satellites in space for a fee for two decades. No one outside the business knows anything about them. Everyone knows about SpaceX.The real point of my most is the anti-human vibe that I get from these guys. They suffer from the same problem Randians have in that their materialism leads inevitably to a blood bath. It’s the trouble with “economic man” and “transactional man” in that moist robots can never have empathy.

        Elon Musk’s greatest skill is identifying a cash flow to farm. Not creating a concept, but figuring out how money moves and inserting a toll road, so to speak.The signal annoyance with the takeover by automation of personal life is what I call the ‘accommodation effect’, as in what aspect of your life will you be forced to alter because whoever setup the machine never even thought about you doing something a particular way. Ask anybody with a Roomba about dropping a receipt or piece of newspaper on the floor. The driverless cars will end up as government property, because “why would you need your own?”.

        He certainly gives off a huckster vibe. But I’m cynical about self interest or self aggrandizers. Why in the world is Mark Cuban on TV selling AT&amp;T smart phones?

        How hard is it to imagine Elon Musk saying that it would be more “efficient” to recycle the old for their phosphorous? Turn deformed babies into animal feed?
Same as it is for every man—and less. I’ve yet to see Musk implement a bureaucracy of Death Panels and Groningen Protocols. Or applaud one. Or call for one.
No matter what Musk’s philosophy, it’s a long leap from rockets, batteries, and AI to the “destruction of life not worth living.”

        Blame Elon Musk’s parents.  Give a kid a name like that and he’s going to grow up thinking he’s Buckminster Fuller.  Elon Musk is his own refutation – in a well-ordered world his would be the name of a particularly offensive brand of cologne.

        I don’t know about SpaceX being a parasite; I thought most of their business plan involved revenues from other businesses.  The SpaceX launch that just happened carried two private satellites, didn’t it?
The U.S. Government is just another customer to them, although one with very deep pockets.
I think Musk is just a smart guy who sees which way the wind is currently blowing.  He doesn’t want to end up like Gibson Guitar if he can just mumble the right things and get a free pass.

        Techno libertarisans wouldn’t want to render people into ‘feed’ because that would be bad for business, fewer potential customers. Terrible PR, too.

        I always liked Thiel, the other PayPal Co-founder, better, he says stuff like:
“The future of technology is not pre-determined, and we must resist the temptation of technological utopianism – the notion that technology has a momentum or will of its own, that it will guarantee a more free future, and therefore that we can ignore the terrible arc of the political in our world.”
&amp;
“I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”

            Theil is right. Majoritarianism/democracy means people voting to enlarge the welfare state by taking wealth from the most  productive and spreading it to the least, a form of slavery in which the productive are exploited by the parasitic..
