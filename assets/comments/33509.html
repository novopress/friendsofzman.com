        The revolution will just have to happen one funeral at a time. I‚Äôve tried to make friendly bridges to This Side of the Great Divide and I get blank stares from old Republicans and that ‚Äúis he Old Scratch?‚Äù face from left-leaning people of all ages.

            Well at least you get blank stares from old Rep‚Äôs. I get them from Dem‚Äôs as well. Met our neighborhood retired Governor just yesterday while walking the dog. He was without wife and had a hankering to talk politics‚Äîdon‚Äôt they all? Such talks are fairly short since I‚Äôm a hard case. I believe he confuses me with a fellow traveler since I‚Äôm retired from University.He started reminiscing about government days and his discussion with University Presidents wrt holding tuition stable. He said he offered a 10% increase in funding if they promise no tuition hikes for 5 years. They came to no agreement. I dismissed educational administrators as ‚Äúwhores‚Äù that do anything for money, and then turned to the greater aspect of the discussion‚Äîjust what he thought a 10% increase in spending would accomplish education-wise?He was taken back at this. I believe that he assumed more money=better education axiomatically. I do not. I then gave him my grand theory of social work from a measurement and research perspective, ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt measure it, it doesn‚Äôt exist.‚ÄùThat was my blank stares of the day‚Ä¶. üòâ

                Compsci, if I were you, I‚Äôd be very careful around these personalities; they are badly malformed [vis-a-vis classical notions of stable personalities].
Our ancestors used to say, ‚ÄúScratch a Liberal, get a Fascist‚Äù.
But nowadays, it‚Äôs more like, ‚ÄúScratch a retired University Professor, get a serial killer.‚Äù
SRSLY, BRO.
Be very very careful around these badly malformed personalities.

                    I will consider your perspective.  I hope my dog is not a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù if I get punched in the face.  üòâTo my defense (I guess) I am old and few people now a days gives a hoot in hell what I think and I have few people of the classical liberal mind set to converse with anyway.  Wife is worthless in that respect as she simply wants to go along to get along (don‚Äôt they all?).As much as I like this forum, you guys‚Äîand girls‚Äîjust can‚Äôt be expected to challenge me from a Leftist/Liberal perspective.  It takes the edge off of one‚Äôs argumentation when directly confronting the opposition so to speak.  I need practice in this area, certainly with my own self control as well as argumentation.Does this make sense?

                        What is the point of verbal dialectic with an adversary anyway? There is no common foundation of accepted objective reality, no first principles to build upon in the pursuit of discovering some shared truth.

                            For practicing one‚Äôs own argument, tash. We are people who talk to the mirror all the time‚Ä¶have an internal dialogue and a moral quandry, that is. Weconsider.
The disadvantage points to the difference.  Street hustlers, union negotiators, criminal lawyers‚Äìthey too have an internal dialogue, but it‚Äôs how to seek advantage, not to be fair, or objective, or walk in another‚Äôs moccasins.
Apparently, they can completely distance themselves, as if there were one self inside watching the other self outside dispassionately.  The one outside might be ranting or threatening, while the one inside cooly watches for cues.

                                I do think dialog with allies can serve the purpose of honing arguments based on reason to sharper service in support of the more important moral frame. It is the moral frame that is primary though and that rests on a foundation independent of reason. The enemy is not just wrong, they are evil. This is both true and necessary to reinforce the moral frame required to embolden and motivate. I think a great service to our side is to come up with characterizations of the enemy that are both fitting and have a succinctness suitable for screaming in their faces with righteous rage. Baby Killer is certain one. The goal is to frame the enemy, both who they are and what they stand for, in moral terms that are unacceptable to the majority.

                                I think it‚Äôs just that what Gen. Lee used to call ‚Äúthose people‚Äù are supremely self-unaware. On those numerous occasions when you‚Äìmeaning ‚Äúyou,‚Äù not ‚Äúone‚Äù‚Äìthink, ‚ÄúCan you even *hear* yourself?!‚Äù the answer is no. But YOU have to supply that answer, for those people are too self-unaware to do it.

                            And this is one way matters have changed. With old school, mainline liberals‚Äìthey no longer exist‚Äìdialogue and reasoned debate was possible and therefore worthwhile. That is no longer the case. The postmodern Leftist is a twisted zealot with whom we share absolutely no common ground. They cannot be reached. These people are not opponents, they are enemies. We‚Äôre to the point that there are only three possible outcomes: separation, subjugation or war.

                            And yet, most everyone on this side of the Great Divide feels the impulse to do it.  There‚Äôs got to be an evolutionary reason normal white men (and some women) want to do this.  I understand the oftentimes futility of these conversations, but it‚Äôs a mostly harmless activity.

                                Normal white men expect that people respond to fact and reason. Back when normal white men ran things, facts and reason quite often won the day.

                        Krustykurmudgeon: ‚ÄúThe democratic party had way more power in the 50s-90s and I don‚Äôt recall the party being full of malformed personalities‚Äù
And yet, here we are, in the 2020s, and the democrat party is now 110% badly malformed personalities.
That poor fellow, from Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, with the horrible brain injury, is about the closest thing the DEMs have to a reasonably normal personality in their midst.

                    Among ‚Äúleftists,‚Äù throwing (other people‚Äôs) money at education is sacred. Throwing money at favored causes in general is sacred. And I use that word advisedly. It‚Äôs their demonstration that they care about the ‚Äúright‚Äù things. How it is spent, whether it does any good, entirely beside the point. The point is that they care. About the right things.

                        Probably because its not true. Look at the fiasco of RFKJr hearings. More than one demanded RFK renounce ever getting funding from big med or big pharma, and yet the most vicious harpies (yes, Bernie is also a harpie) accept at least 6 figures of funding from them.
I‚Äôm not convinced money is the cause. I think it‚Äôs probably pure irrationalism and hysteria.

                Well, provided Trump completes his work to remake the Republican Party in his image, and kick old old idiot geezers who hate him, the party will be more attractive to young people, especially young men. What 25 year old is going to sign up for a party that only cares about corporate tax cuts, cheap labor, and Ronald Reagan? A party that not once, not ever, has shown any desire to helping him out or tried to make his life easier? It‚Äôs stupid. Now, that guy might not sign up for the party that only cares about the deep state and to turn the country into South Africa, but he also isn‚Äôt signing up for Republicans.

This is the demographic that not only is unserved, it is the cultural target.  There is vast potential there and they‚Äôd rally to most anyone that, finally, expressed and defended their interests.

                        Elon certainly has many faults, but at least he was canny enough to go on Rogan and issue a call to young men.
I‚Äôm paraphrasing, but the call was something like, ‚ÄúGo out and vote like your life depended on it, because it does. If Kamala wins it‚Äôs all over.‚Äù
Based on the election results, that call was heard and answered.

                Steve. I was an absolute idiot in my early years. To know me was to be certain I was going nowhere in life. Even attending university was an after thought. Undergraduate years were less than serious. Until my twenties, little real independent effort put into studies. I‚Äôd say I was possibly one of those in your graph.What happened? I grew up. So will many of those polled in the table you posted. You grow up when faced with reality and the need to be an adult. The Dem‚Äôs and their Leftist philosophy are enticing, but give them long enough and their policies will screw you every time.

                    Oh, absolutely! It‚Äôs easy to be young and stupid. When I was that age, I seriously considered being a lawyer so I could become a politician. I forget who said it, but people tend to be conservative about those things they know best. And as they age into their 30s and 40s, they will probably be pretty close to the current 30s and 40s.
It‚Äôs just in the mean time, we are adding people who have not yet grown up. Plus people who now have skin in the game to continue the migrant lunacy.

                    Your developmental curve sounds identical to mine. I was such a lazy, immature bum that I didn‚Äôt even graduate high school on time. I appeared headed toward a vocational degree in making gravel rather than a doctorate in Russian intellectual history. (Not that the latter is much less disreputable than the former, by the by.) But, at the age of 20 the IRS audited and punished me severely for failure to report tips, and this event knocked me out of college‚Äìwhere I was just scraping by‚Äìfor three years. During those three years, I grew up 20, and that maturation saved me from God know what sort of life.

            Over the years, on my way here, I gave people a lot of blank stares. That‚Äôs often just an outward manifestation of the inability to react to some truth you can‚Äôt refute. It‚Äôs part of the journey. You‚Äôre aware enough, of true and false, to know what‚Äôs true, but you aren‚Äôt yet able to address it in the mental frame to which you‚Äôve been conditioned. Slowly, as more ‚Äúnew‚Äù truths are encountered, that conditioning is thrown off, the mental frame adjusts. Until a threshold is reached which seems sudden at the time, but really isn‚Äôt.But I was at least partway ‚Äúhere‚Äù from youth, it must be admitted, insofar as I distrusted the media from my teens, and never gave whites grief about being ‚Äúracist,‚Äù even though I thought of myself as the colorblind non-racist person I‚Äôd been raised to be. For instance, it was safe to say the word nigger in my presence, and I wouldn‚Äôt say anything to you about it. So maybe I didn‚Äôt have as far to travel to the DR as some. Some have so far to travel that they can probably never get here. But probably some percentage of the blank stares you receive are works in progress who may get ‚Äúhere.‚Äù

            I had one of those mindless video spirals yesterday after a long productive day of work. It was a bunch of well produced clips made by Marines. Some were very slick MIC videos, but most were done on the spot during some field training. You get a glimpse of some of the people serving in the military alongside some absolute chads and it is shocking. Of course in the MIC slick clip it was some exercise in the Middle East and they put front and center 3 blacks a fat dumpy latinx and the rest of the phalanx were chad 101sters. Two of the blacks in the very front were being filmed for a high production clip and they were talking to each other out of the sides of their mouths and smiling.No posture, no gravitas, no discipline. In contrast was some behind the scenes footage, (iPhone shot), of the Army Honor Guard doing the 21 gun salute for the inauguration. These guys were put together with perfect uniforms, in freezing cold with no shivering, full decorum in firing the canons and then did the heavy lifting to get the gear ready to be taken away. It is very striking when you see these things. Hegseth was on a short clip to the men reporting on the crash. He looks put together. He had his sleeves rolled up showing his We The People tattoos. I am not a fan of tattoos, but this guy looks like he is a leader.May he do a very healthy amount of orangemailing and culling the grossly unfit from the forces. Just looking at it is demoralizing. I can only imagine being in and around it.May VIth Revolution continue to steamroll.

                Aside from this recent airport crash incident, which I have little knowledge of, things (DIE) are still bad in AZ.  Our Dem governor, Hobbs, just appointed a new AZ Supreme Court judge.  The announcement from her at a press conference was shown on local TV.  Hobbs was literally giddy as she proudly announced our ‚Äò‚Ä¶first Latina, Black, Woman‚Ä¶‚Äô Supreme Court justice.  WOW, just wow, 3 check boxes marked for diversity!  Got to be a record, although I suppose our new SC Justice could also have been a lesbian in a wheel chair for even more ‚Äúqualifications‚Äù‚Ä¶.But wait, it gets better.  The appointee was at the press conference and spoke to the press.  I did not hear if her comments were directed at questions from the press, but did hear her say, ‚Äò‚Ä¶I‚Äôm proud to be a diversity candidate and what we need is even more diversity and inclusion on the Court‚Ä¶‚Äô. Not a word was mentioned of her accomplishments during her past days as an appeals court judge in the system.  Sigh‚Ä¶.

                    This is worth noting. Strangely enough, good things are happening at the FedGov level, but matters are still appalling at the state and local levels. Typically, anything consequential percolates up rather than trickles down. Let us hope that the Trumpening rapidly permeates the lower levels of society rather than running into insuperable walls of recalcitrance.

                        I was perhaps too pessimistic.  Trump already had an effect.  The AZ legislature picked up seats in the House and Senate.  We were down to one seat margins last term.  This was a surprise to me.  We also have a long term conservative Rep Congress critter, who is standing down and taking a run for Governor in 2026.  That‚Äôs a powerful opponent for the highest State office.

                    No doubt Compsci. The rot is very deep. Very very deep. There are a lot of things to be wary about in regards to the techno-optimists. In some sense they are hyper-managerialists. Everything is to be optimized for hyper efficiency and this is a technological economic zone. We are going to have to find a way to get them to understand that We are A People. We in particular are The People. The DIE stuff and the open statement by Trump that someone decided there were too many white people at FAA is huge.I digress. The shutoff of the money is the death of the Clinton/Soros shadow government system. On another positive note, the techno optimists are ready to play for keeps. In regards to the state and local rot Peter Thiel told carpet munching infiltrator Bari that during Covid they took massive sums of debt off of the books of municipalities. He said they were all blue. Then he pulled the dagger out. He said that they are bankrupt again and that one option is to just let them go insolvent this time.They realized that the other side was playing for keeps. Now they are too. Perhaps the federal NGO de-funding will cascade and force a blue metro reckoning. Another positive sign is the location of the initial ICE raids. Military ICE units went into blue redoubts with a show of force.At some point, well, we know the old rules and the old system is dead and the rot deep and broad. So, who has the resolve to accept that reality and the reality of the generations coming of age, and act accordingly will win.‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù V was killed in ‚Äô20, and those revolutionaries had both hands on our throat. So far, Trump is acting like a guy who pulled a counter move and is ready to reciprocate. May the Gods be with him and be with Us and may we all prove worthy of their backing.

            I suspect when all is said and done, there will be evidence of incompetence in the accident likely to be the result of hiring/promotion pref‚Äôs.  However, jumping to conclusions and using this incident as evidence prematurely is risky.  Yeah, it works for the Left and is an old ploy, but will it work for the Right?  OK, color me ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù.

                The current MSM take is that the air traffic control center was understaffed (19 instead of 30). Of course, Trump has not been in office long enough to cause such understaffing, which I understand has been a problem for years (thousands  were canned for refusing the Covid shot).

            According to Urban Dictionary, it‚Äôs a portmanteau of ‚Äòtrans‚Äô and ‚Äògoon.‚Äô
Not related to ‚Äúpoltroon‚Äù.
When I saw its face, I immediately thought he [she?] had the physiognomy of an highly unstable Cluster-B which would want to go out in a blaze-of-glory suicide.
He/she drove the helicopter straight into the airplane.
Has to have been either a Cluster-B Suicide, or else the activation of an MK Ultra asset.

                Sorry, that was the crew chief, the pilot was Joe Ellis. Still, possibly 3 on board, so 2 or even all 3 might have been ‚Äòspecial‚Äô.Joe Ellis, as a troon, gave a outraged rant on a radio show just before about how banning trans from the military would affect a troon‚Äôs military career.*Now, all trans industry stems from the transition drugs sold by one Israeli company, Teva Pharm; the clinics and drugs have ridden their wave of profitability and are about to tank, so the companies involved have almost certainly been short-sold up the wazoo. I wonder what the put options on Teva are selling for.Notably, the flight took off from right near Langley and started violating air rules in short order.I say it‚Äôs a message within a message: the inside message is to Trump, with plausible deniability applied to blaming Big Trans, past its expiration date and about to be thrown under the bus, to Big Diversity, also under the bus, while the Intel community (run by the State Dept., not Defense) and the neocons tell Trump and his renegade jewish cohorts to back off from international affairs, and stick to domestic turf.*Joe Ellis, the troon pilot they‚Äôre pinning the blame on, also conveniently discovered his Jewish Faith just recently.  One message for the insiders, a different picture for the outsiders here.

        Another massive punch is in process of being throw. K. Leavitt is holding a press conference. They are setting the stage to replace the mainstream media. She announced that 10K applications of independent bloggers and podcasters have been received and that they may have to expand the room. She then let a podcaster lead with the first question.Caesar brought in a bunch of Gauls to the Senate. We can hope that Trump is going to bring in a bunch of American independent gumshoes and podcasters to replace the Gauls in the press room.This is fantastic. Wow! I love it.

In other words, culture is downstream from politics rather than the reverse, pace what many on the right say.
For example, the US government has championed homosexuality and various other paraphilic movements over the past few decades, and now most, if not yet all, mainline protestant churches have followed suit.

        My stash of the specific banned lightbulb I depended on ran out a few weeks ago. The unbanned (so I assume something is very wrong with them) incandescents and trashy LEDs that are supposed to be equivalent aren‚Äôt similar at all. I‚Äôve been trying all kinds of goofy color combinations to get back to seeing everything clearly without getting tired. Where I sit and work looks like a psychedelic whorehouse now. (Theory: Hideous pink-purple YouTube video lighting has caught on because ‚Äúnaturalistic‚Äù LED light looks even worse than that.)Trump‚Äôs threatened un-ban is weirdly unpopular among the MAGAs. The nerd doing the Redditackshuallyabout LED spectra (etc.) always wins the thread. Everyone enjoys when the government ruins someone else‚Äôs day‚Äîespecially if they can say your day isn‚Äôtreallyruined, you‚Äôre just insane. ‚ÄúAnemoia‚Äù was the word of the day in some calendar app, so everyone wants to use it as an insult. And of course conservatives love nothing more than to say, ‚ÄúThe liberals are right about this.‚Äù (Or maybe they love ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get for not installing the world‚Äôs most expensive computer-controlled lighting array over your toilet‚Äù more.)The classic American lightbulb, unjustly exiled, was a dear symbol to the normalfag right. That‚Äôs why Trump is into it. But the movement has passed him by. Trumpism without Trump:If you value anything you‚Äôve lost, you‚Äôre a loser.

            The American incandescent light bulb is an excellent example of why the government should stay out of the free market.  The Fed‚Äôs demanded through their incandescence ban that everyone convert to fluorescent (CFL) lighting.  CFL‚Äôs had mercury in them, which was politely ignored by regulators and most environmentalists.  At that time, there were *no* LED light fixtures as we now know them.  The mandated changeover therefore went to those gawd awful CFL‚Äôs.However, by the time of the imminent ban of incandescent bulbs, the market (now mostly CFL) began to fill up with the LED alternative.  LED‚Äôs were more energy efficient and had better lighting color and smaller size for such applications which needed such.  By the time of the ban, CFL sales had fallen off a cliff in favor of LED lighting.  Since then, there has been great improvement in LED technology and they are as cheap as the incandescents ever were.  (Yes, there were initial problems as described with different brands of LED lights as to brightness and color matching, but such is not as problematic today.)Long and the short, if government had not promoted a second rate technology, we‚Äôd have been better off (without the CFL‚Äôs) and no worse for energy efficiency today.  LED was the correct ‚Äúbet‚Äù, but government failed to guess correctly in choosing the technology.

                LEDs are inferior to most home applications, though very good for street lighting and commercial lighting.  To the extent they saved energy, all and more of the savings have gone into data centers and bitcoin mining and the like.  It‚Äôs the paradox of thrift.One thing that never happened with real light bulbs is them catching fire.  I just had this happen to me (like a month ago) on a light that is always on in my house, even when I‚Äôm out.  It literally caught fire and starting dumping smoke into my living room.  These damned chinabulbs are loaded with cheap electronics and encased in plastic. Luckily I was home and unplugged the lamp and took it outside.

                    I must disagree Tars.  As to fires, so did incandescent if they touched flammable material and such.  There is little reason to have fires, except perhaps in faulty LED electronics.  I‚Äôve never experienced such and find no reports outlining such concerns‚Äîindeed the opposite‚Äîciting the low temp‚Äôs of LED bulbs.  However, the life expectancy of the bulb‚Äôs are pure BS.  The electronics burn out just like incandescent filaments it seems, but they always cite the life span for the LED, which has a very long life span.My entire house is now pretty much LED, inside and out.  Never a fire or smoke problem.  Two observations wrt the low cost and variety of the lights:One, the expanded lighting made economical by the technology‚Äîinside and outside‚Äîis a thousand times more useful and appealing and helpful in enjoyment of the home.  Two, given the cost of the electricity vs the energy consumption I simply use more lighting and therefore it is doubtful I save any electricity.  This is a phenomenon often comment upon by economists. Seems to hold true for me.

                        Real lightbulbs have a glass envelope and a steel base with a small high temp isolator and then the tungsten filament.  Granted, they get pretty hot, but we were using them 100 years and so lamps and light fixtures are designed to deal with the heat.  Cheap Chinese capacitors OTOH are flammable and all will eventually fail. Though, luckily, they have been nowhere near as long lasting as when first promised so the bulb dulls usually before the capacitor shorts (most bulbs are overdriving the LEDs).  I just happened to be unlucky in that mine lasted long enough.  If the plastic base had caught fire, it would have dripped flaming plastic onto anything below it. Great for spreading the fire.Many of the decorative bulbs are either not being made or difficult to find.  Their color is terrible.  I keep hearing how much better the newer ones are.  After the incident with the flaming bulb, I ordered a few off Amazon and it was the harshest super bright white light I have ever seen in a light bulb.Frankly I wish I had the choice.  I would likely use a mix of old incandescent bulbs and LED bulbs. LED lights are good for some things.‚ÄúNever a fire or smoke problem.‚ÄùI never had one either, till a month or 2 ago.

                            ‚ÄúI ordered a few off Amazon and it was the harshest super bright white light I have ever seen in a light bulb.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a zoo out there. You need to pay careful attention to the color spec‚Äôs and even then, the Chinese lie their head off on these. As to bright white, or 5k+ Kelvin, these seem good for security and photography printing since they are close to daylight. For home use, or other decorative lighting, not so much.Perhaps Trump will role back the incandescent ban on typical home use (100w, 60w, etc) bulbs. Incandescent ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù bulbs are still available. I had to find one because the LED dimmable I purchased created waay too much electrical interference.Finally, I note we may be talking past each other a bit.  Old eyes like/need brighter and whiter bulbs.

                I remember those CFL bulbs. I once dropped one in the house and shattered it. I had to clean it up, put it in a secure container, open the windows, and evacuate my apartment for a while to let it air out. It is crazy that the nanny state we have today foisted that tech upon people because I *know* that maybe 1 out of 100 people who broke one of these bulbs took these precautions.As to the energy savings of these bulbs vs. incandescent, wake me up when the Gaia crowd starts talking about how much energy adult websites use.

                    In my old dept, we had the same problem.  However, I was smart enough to clean up and ‚Äúshut up‚Äù. The policy of the university was to notify ‚ÄúRisk Management‚Äù.  Never notify Risk Management if you know what‚Äôs good for you.  They‚Äôll tie you up and shut you down for any reason their regulatory minds can think (?) of.  Once had a toilet overflow in an annex office area with carpet.  They would not allow a carpet cleaning, but required a tear out and replace to the tune of a couple grand, vs perhaps a hundred bucks for the carpet cleaner.

                Don‚Äôt forget that halogen and zenon were also acceptable ‚Äúenergy efficient‚Äù options, despite being maybe 20% better when they were new. Halogens lose light output as they age. Before the life expectancy had dropped 10%, they were worse than incandescents.

            Yes. See my post above. It is a hyper-managerialism that is in opposition to nationalism. The key is if we can make them understand the value in keeping us a people with an overwhelming majority. That also hinges on if some powerful subset of them can have their megalomania and desire for adoration be swayed such that fulfilling duties to a people and a country is a supreme act of honor and nobility for their legacy. Right now, their egos are bent on building bots and building companies and thus wealth.Perhaps, the H1B fiasco and future fights we are going to have over who We are, will cause some to come over and be true nationalists. We have to all be ready for the many battles in this war ahead. I suspect what will really sway them is what already happened since Revolution IV in the 60s. That was not civic nationalism that was ethnic rivalry. Now that the majority is a minority, these people and their overlord internationalists went for the throat and tried to cement a permanent racial caste system. This will hinge on whether Musk, Andreesen ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ understand the inevitability and instability of multi-racial societies. It will be hard, because they see non-American strivers behaving and doing the right things. They can think down the road decades and centuries in terms of technology, but can they do it for civilization? That is the problem with merchants and technocrats. They do not value human nature or civilization. They are not its backbone, they are heavily dependent upon it.That is the key. Can they come to understand and accept human nature and drop their belief that history is linear and only improvements in economic and technological factors are necessary and inevitable. They are utopians, so something will have to give.

        At the risk of a severe beating from the dissidents, I will double down on that hated trope.ALL YA GOTTA DO to save our broken country is clean house. Get rid of the clowns. Fire the incompetent. Replace them with serious men. Sure ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to stand up to blue haired purple faced raging women‚Ä¶ but you can‚Äôt let them run the show. Ditto for the legions of perverts and grifters.I‚Äôm old enough to remember when there were still serious people you could actually talk with from the other side of the great divide.Look ‚Äì I get the heebeejeebies too. Trump is bulldozing away trash and garbage that has been lying around for so long‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve just gotten used to it and accepted it as part of the political landscape. A lot of us are so mired in it that we have deep doom pilled.It is time for cautious optimism. Trump is kicking the trash to the curb. Maybe it‚Äôs time we all did the same in our lives too?
