        If seems you have an obsession with science and empiricism. If a scientist claiming to have empirical data said liberals were smarter would your head explode from having to decide between being smarter or being conservative? Or would you say this scientist was full of BS? Science don’t have all the answers and scientists are on occasion wrong .

            Biology says my head will never explode on it own. Therefore the answer is my head will not explode if confronted with data about liberalism and IQ. Further, liberals probably do, on average, have higher IQ’s than non-liberals. I have no data to suggest it, but that is my seat of the pants guess based on half a century of living. Blaise Pascal was a brilliant mathematician and a raving religious fanatic. Belief is separate from IQ just as IQ and sanity are unrelated. Ted Kaczynski has an extremely high IQ, but he is insane.Science does not have all the answers or even most of them. That’s not the issue. The question is whether Intelligent Design is science, which it surely is not. As I mentioned in my post, ID’ers cannot defend their theory so they instead pick nits with Darwin and evolution. That’s something they have in common with liberals.
