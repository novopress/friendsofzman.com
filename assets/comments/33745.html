        What people don’t understand about immigration statistics is that the immigrants aren’t spread out across the population in terms of age. They’re generally 20-40 years old. So, those 87k non-white immigrants to Ireland need to be compared to the 20-40-year-old Irish population, which is ~1.25 million.
Thus, that 87k is actually 7% of that age group’s population. That’s stunning. Ireland is toast in less than a decade if this continues.

        Lefties will tell you that Trump wants to make Canada a state but not Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is “full of brown people who vote Democrat.” I would suggest to Trump that he reconsider Canada; their people might not be as brown, but most of them would vote Democrat if given the chance.

            I suspect that Trump wants badly to be chronicled in history books.  If he takes Canada or Greenland, historians will be forced to write about him, whatever else he may do.
That’s the only real motivation for these foolish ideas.  His ego does not care about the consequences so long as he is memorialized.

            Exactly. The Jews control Ukraine. In general, all Jews hate Russia and seek its destruction. The Bolshevik regime in 1917-1935 was mostly Jewish. It committed genocide against the Russian people.
Now they want to do it again. That is the basis of their current war against Russia. Therefore, a victory for Russia would be a defeat for the Jews. It would also be a victory for the American people against our globalist Deep State.

                Last I checked, the Bolsheviks killed millions of *Ukrainians* before 1935. So much for that theory.
Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll find a way to blame the Jews for that too.

        cool quote. It really is the true great divide. Is there a natural man like your dad thinks?“It is not that Augustine failed to recognise, still less that he denied, the intellect’s power of attaining truth without revelation; it is rather that he regarded the Christian wisdom as one whole, that he tried to penetrate by his understanding the Christian faith and to see the world and human life in the light of the Christian wisdom. He knew quite well that rational arguments can be adduced for God’s existence, for example, but it was not so much the mere intellectual assent to God’s existence that interested him as the real assent, the positive adhesion of the will to God, and he knew that in the concrete such an adhesion to God requires divine grace. In short, Augustine did not play two parts, the part of the theologian and the part of the philosopher who considers the natural man; he thought rather of man as he is in the concrete, fallen and redeemed mankind, man who is able indeed to attain truth but who is constantly solicited by God’s grace and who requires grace in order to appropriate the truth that saves.…This attitude was characteristic of the Augustinian tradition.St. Anselm’s aim is expressed in his words Credo, ut intelligam, while St. Bonaventure, in the thirteenth century, explicitly rejected the sharp delimitation of the spheres of theology and philosophy. The Thomist distinction between the sciences of dogmatic theology and philosophy, with the accompanying distinction of the modes of procedure to be employed in the two sciences, no doubt evolved inevitably out of the earlier attitude,though, quite apart from that consideration, it obviously enjoys this very great advantage that it corresponds to an actual and real distinction between revelation and the data of the ‘unaided’ reason, between the supernatural and natural spheres. It is at once a safeguard of the doctrine of the supernatural and also of the powers of man in the natural order. Yet the Augustinian attitude on the other hand enjoys this advantage, that it contemplates always man as he is, man in the concrete, for de facto man has only one final end, a supernatural end, and, as far as actual existence is concerned, there is but man fallen and redeemed: there never has been, is not, and never will be a purely ‘natural man’ without a supernatural vocation and end.”Frederick Copleston, Medieval Philosophy

        There is no need for Canada to join the US. It is already our 51st State, in effect, but without the vote. It is totally subservient to US foreign policy, and provides cheap raw materials. Its population is now 41.6 million, thanks to mass immigration. Jewish money controls its politics and Jews agitate for open borders, just as in the US.California now has 52 congressmen (43 D + 9 R) based on its current population of 39.6 million. So Canada would be bigger than CA in terms of electoral clout, if it were to officially join the US, The Democrats would beat Republicans by the same ratio as in CA. However, it’s worse than that, because Canada would be divided into five States, each with two Democrat Senators. That would be a terrible deal for the Republican Party. But Trump doesn’t care. He’s much too stupid and crooked to care. He is a willing tool of the Jews.

        I am about your age, Derbs, and grew up in Britain.  I never heard of Empire Day: my parents, and their circle, and my school, presumably didn’t give a fig for it.  If it was mentioned in the papers I must have auto-censored the articles.
Only a few years ago did I first hear of Commonwealth Day. I give no figs for that either.

            What I would like to hear are reminisces of the Post-War years in Britain. Women on bicycles in the freezing slush, bringing home a bit of coal to keep from frostbite! Children gathering watercress from ponds for something to fill a sandwich!Meanwhile, triumphant Americans enrolled in the GI Bill to build an economic boom based on building hospitals and schools and making clothing for all the babies being born. Driving roaring 1950s Chevys, while the Ukrainian told me his mother and her friends washed their hair in buckets of captured rainwater!Yet here we have the British, as cheerful and courtly as any Canadian, while they trundled through the bounced rubble. Truly I am proud to be from such a globe-spanning people, truly I am shamed for not celebrating their resolute grace!

                Our coal was delivered by lorry.  Whenever the coal man drove past our dining room window we children would chorus “Aye, aye, Hector Mackay”.We gathered from the hedgerows – raspberries, brambles, rosehips.  All good fun. From ponds we gathered only frog spawn – endlessly interesting as the wee beasties matured.I can remember being refused sweets from a sweet-shop though I had enough money.  That must have been rationing – which continued long after the war mainly at the behest of the socialist government.We didn’t have rubble though the poor souls in a village about eight miles away had had some: nearly thirty killed by a few bombs dropped by a German bomber on its return from bombing Clydeside.  Proportional to population that was far worse than 9/11.A friend did have a bomb shelter in his back garden though. Rather dank!

        Not only was today’s a joy to read, but, as always, a joy to listen to as well. A century of Island history in short order! And an alternate history to boot! I can hear Derb’s father in his voice. A salute to you both, sir; God save the King, and most urgently the Irish.I did want to thank you, Mr. Derb, you have saved me from dire consequence. A granddaughter insisted on naming one of her sons “Micheal”. I was aghast at such abuse, a controversy ensued. She stood her ground, and Micheal it is. Now I can make amends and tell her proudly that she was right after all, she has named her boy in the rich Irish tradition!(I have an Irish last name myself; my English grandfather on the boat over traded identity papers with an Irish criminal who wanted to go back to his family in London. Grandads swore he would never again return to the East End, after his long sojourn in New Zealand.)Apropos of nothing, I would be remiss were I not to note that the shrews responsible for the flood of “international protection applicants” in Eire happen to be of the HIAS small hat ethnicity; their names I have somewhere in my notes, but they are not as infamous as Barbara Spectre.As to Ms. Zegler, wasn’t Snow White supposed to be prettier than her stepmother, the non-European Gal Gadot? She certainly qualifies as a “mid”; I’m not seeing a rosy blush in her dusky Colombian cheeks, nor a hint of blue eyes in either.One great consolation to this Disney disaster is a genre called Chatmusic on youtube; somewhat raucous tweet replies are set to music, absolutely roasting that poor girl.Heaven forbid that we should find them hilarious; I must find a link for your delectation.
