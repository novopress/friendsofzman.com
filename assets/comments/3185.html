        Which brings us to Title IX, “Dear Colleague…”, and “This job requires (any) BA to apply”.Gosh, all that Pell grant cash ends up …WHERE?With a contractual “promise” to produce WHAT?Some folks might call it gambling.A BA is the “new” K-12 “certificate of attendance”.

        “It’s a dirty, dark secret in the black community.” Charles should know that it ain’t a secret. Just because few, most especially any whites, will state something out loud doesn’t make the something a secret.

        The elite have noble ideas, but always have had. Many years ago when the UK scrapped its (logical) secondary education system which separated the capable from the not so capable and replaced it with an illogical scheme of throwing all the capabilities into one pot, the ‘educationists’ said that those doing well would encourage the ones doing less well to improve and try harder in class.Good elite chattering point, but not at all real. By and large all that happened was the dumbing down spread far and wide and the less capable made sure the capable didn’t do anything but cower in the corner and stay quiet.When a person can beat the crap out of someone doing well because they can’t do it themselves then both the beater feels good (as they have finally achieved something) and the person who once did well now makes sure they don’t do anything to upset the ones with big fists.Oddly, the elite never noticed that bit.

        I’ve heard Barkley lose his mind and his argument when he didn’t understand a point or a question. Then he falls back on the tribe. But we are so starved for a little simple honesty and frankness that we’ll hold a parade for the guy  who does.

        “Whether or not you agree with Sowell, putting people into a position for which they are unqualified is a terrible idea, regardless of the justification.”
I see what you did there.  You obviously had Barack Hussein Obama in  mind when you wrote that.  You’re one helluva sly dude.

        Last time I commented on a Coates post, he banned me from the Atlantic for calling him out as a bullshit artist. Thin-skinned little jerk. Comments are closed on this one. Of course.
I think Coates knows what he is.
