        That revolver article is funny.
The guy breezily dismisses the idea that the dollar‚Äôs status is driven by US military supremacy.  And then sites as his first point supporting that assertion that the US is still the world‚Äôs hyper power ‚Äì unmatched militarily.
The res of the article is just hand waving to obscure the reality he refutes ‚Äì then embraces in the first paragraph.

        The petro-dollar gave the GAE a few exorbitant privileges
They could print money out of nothing and exhange it with other countries against real assets (industrial products or oil). In the future, America will have to trade something valuable against what it purchases,
Hence a sharp future decline in leaving standards, extremely easy to observe every time you do your groceries

        Good post.Z. The only problem with this post is the very problem now at the center of dissident politics. Demographics.Everyone is on here posting about currency reforms and re-shoring industry, et cetera.The problem is we are now/becoming a minority white country. This includes pleasures like a 1 party state, lack of talent/skilled workforce, et cetera.Managerialism will continue to grow because the population wanting it is growing and the population not interested is declining.The GAE is not reformable because it committed ethnic suicide already. Manufacturing industry is not coming back to the United States, the currency will be in decline for the foreseeable future, our currently livable cities will become Third World cr*p holes that are unlivable. And no one is going to want to buy real estate in the middle of American cities as the crime and insanity continues to destroy everything. Until white people start acting in our own favor any and building our own communities separate from everyone else, it is only going to get worse and worse for white people and the nation. The Empire will last for a while longer until it grinds down the last of the blood/talent and money out of the remaining white people. Only white cultural reform will allow for reform in the Empire. And not enough white people have woken up yet.

        Z- we‚Äôre not in the 1970s either.Inflation and currency wars are not our worst problems, we‚Äôre in the 2020s and both the American people and the American Empire are fighting for survival, with each other as mortal flow.   America can no longer go on half Nation and Half Empire, one or the other must win.   We üá∫üá∏ Are going to War, actually Wars.  Certainly abroad, probably at home.We üá∫üá∏ The United States of America are rapidly reshoring industry as WE are going to War.  This could not be clearer, it‚Äôs when and Who.My Dears on this the Elites agree, which is why it‚Äôs happening.The Empire wishes to live, DC wishes to live, DC doesn‚Äôt think they live if the Empire collapses and they may well be correct- but above all this is an Emergency and War government since FDR.  They don‚Äôt know how to do anything else.   Well beyond war profiteering or the grossly overexposed Neocons sticking their noses out too far.   The elites have begun to defect back to America, their ally against the Globalists is DOD, DOD has only one real card and it‚Äôs war.  They may tell themselves we‚Äôll reshore industry then pursue peace through strength, as the Globalists control Foreign Policy that‚Äôs not within Nationalist Elites control (I mean they love the nation, not White Nationalist).Or they at least want a better America, even just to show off or make money in a more stable nation.The most serious faction of pro- American elites wants Space and will pay any price to get space, hello my dearest ally DOD.  So war‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the question is where and how bad.Something strange will happen in these wars- we‚Äôll üá∫üá∏ win.  The nation will win, because both the Empire and the nation need to win as they haven‚Äôt since the 1860s.   The Globalists won‚Äôt be able to sabotage DOD and the nation, along the way we of essential necessity get manufacturing back in America.  This will both placate and empower the working class and pro-American elites.The outcome of all this is unknown, that it‚Äôs all settled at home and abroad by war is decided.

            I‚Äôm reliably informed that the US has some super secret wonder weapons that are going to shock the world (PRO, I guess?).
Also told that they‚Äôre one-time-use, irreplaceable once spicy times commence.  Think ‚Äúrod-of-god‚Äù type stuff.  (CON, once the US adversaries figure it out.  They‚Äôre going to be uber pissed off.).
All this to stop things like the belt and road initiatives, which would make the US Navy superfluous for most of the world‚Äôs population.
Are we the baddies?

            Ok, boomer.
None of this is possible because the people that made the empire possible are/have committed ethnic suicide. America is not coming back to 1985 because the ethnic make up of our population will not allow it. White people are headed for a very small fractional minority status in America. The Empire will straggle on until it uses the last talent/money/blood of white people up. How do you go bankrupt? Slowly at first and then all at once. The same will happen to nation as the white people die off/continue to ethnically cleanse themselves.

        This was a very interesting post, and there were a lot of interesting responses.It seems very clear that the reform means greater budgetary and fiscal discipline. It means that we will need to pay our debts out of production and not money printing, borrowing and offshore money flows. That will mean a radical curtailment in government spending, or a default on the debt. Even a curtailment may mean a partial default. Of course, there will be no way around the pension and stock market pain this will cause as well. This may be just as well. Better to bring Mom and Dad home for care in their final days than to be abused in a nursing center.We all know who gets a significant portion of welfare state largesse. In a time of declining living standards, the number one issue is addressing the Anti White regime. We once had the financial ability to throw money and our once great cities on a never ending bonfire of largesse to fund and shelter a dysfunctional  albatross population. We once had the ability to tolerate Anti White hiring, lending and contracting practices. We were greater in number, wealthier and backed by an ability to borrow and spend into oblivion. That ability was backed by the blood and martial prowess of our men who overwhelmingly contributed to our military ‚Äì whether the mission was well or ill conceived. They provided the credible threat, and gave their lives over to it. We have sacrificed enough. And for what? To be cast aside and scorned to feed the delusions and excuses of the failed.After making those sacrifices, we are being thrown under the bus and put last in line by an explicitly Anti White Regime. In an environment where we need all of our resources to ensure our well being, the old appropriation is still a ball and shackle. Now one hand is being tied behind our back if not our legs are being cut off.As we enter this period of reform, whether tackled head on with bold and brilliant leadership or by a tsunami brought on by deep incompetence if not malevolence, the number one issue for us is addressing the handicaps and injustices of the Anti White Regime. No more welfare state appropriations. No more discriminatory hiring practices. No more discriminatory training and job development programs. No more discriminatory lending and contracting programs.Of course, we need to do our part and build ourselves and our people up. We must have all of our own resources at our disposal to do so. Whatever politician stands up and champions this cause is going to have a tsunami of support. It will only grow over time as the multi-polar world forces fiscal restraint and the difficult choices upon our nation. It will only grow as the doors that once welcomed us to come and prove our worth are closed. The Anti White Regime must go.

        Z said: ‚ÄúThe Fed chair is obviously in over his head, but there is no one in Washington noticing this.‚ÄùI would be really curious about Z or other‚Äôs take on Tom Luongo‚Äôs thesis that Powell is now temporarily on our side. This whole shitstorm of international finance is mind-numbingly complicated and, I think, deliberately so.  To greatly simplify, if the Fed raises rates (which it is doing) it screws over certain GAE factions (Davos, Blackrock etc.) but controls inflation for the middle class. If the Fed cuts rates and goes back to QE, the assholes (GAE) are relieved of pressure and inflation kills the middle class.

            That theory seems, at best, like wishful thinking to me.  At worst, it‚Äôs deliberately misleading.No, the chairman of the federal reserve is not going to save us.  It should be common knowledge to everyone here at this point that the central bank is the belly of the beast.  Powell is not and never will be your friend.The reality of the situation is the fed‚Äôs policies have enable all of the evil things that the DoD, federal government, Wall Street, etc. have been up to for over a century now.  This includes the ridiculous things the fed did during Covid under Powell‚Äôs watch.The act of raising rates is not about helping the middle class fight inflation.  It they wanted to do that they wouldn‚Äôt have left rates at zero for over 10 years.  No, it‚Äôs about destabilization; it was a trap.The ensuing crisis will be used to accomplish various things include but not limited to:  ushering in ‚Äústakeholder capitalism‚Äù (destroying property rights), introducing CDBCs (destroying what‚Äôs left of financial autonomy and privacy), and possibly yet another war.  Sorry to disappoint.

        Instead, it means Washington must enter a period of reform similar to what followed the Second World War and the collapse of the gold-backed dollar in the 1970‚Äôs.

You had me to right there and then I had to chuckle. Washington is incapable of economic or monetary reform. The current chuckle heads can‚Äôt do it, and so we‚Äôll need new chuckle heads and that means an event must happen that will cause them to lose their position.

            ‚Äúthis may sound like a stupid question (and maybe it is) but what‚Äôs to stop a country from ‚Äòcreating‚Äô $1T out of thin air?‚ÄùNot a stupid question. Any country can do it. Zimbabwe does it with far bigger sums. They have 100 trillion dollar banknotes. The problem is to get someone to accept that money created ex nihilo in exchange for real goods. The USA has used military coercion to achieve this and also the fact that in the past the USD actually used to be backed by a manufacturing base and/or the USD was 25% backed by gold until 1971 and some of that past luster of the dollar lingers on. But this game can only continue for so long. Eventually no amount of coercion will persuade another country to accept fiat money created by a deadbeat country on its way down,.

            In a technical sense, absolutely nothing. In a practical sense, there are a couple things that keep that impulse in check. First, devaluing a currency reduces it‚Äôs value to voluntary users. Not everyone who currently uses a given currency, like the dollar, have to use it (US citizens living in territory have to, of course, but foreigners in foreign countries aren‚Äôt necessarily forced to, so it‚Äôs important to provide stability in order to keep them using the dollar).Second, rapid inflation destabilizes prices, which encourages spending and discourages lending. In America‚Äôs particular situation, making dollars worth less in real terms in order to write down debt is practically the same as raising interest rates because both scenarios, from a lender‚Äôs perspective, are a practically negative rate of return.What the fed is trying to do is wean financial institutions (basically every Fortune 1000 company) off cheap credit, preferably slowly so as not to trigger massive bankruptcy. If companies had shown any sort of fiscal responsibility and not leveraged themselves to the max with debt, this would be feasible. However, very few companies have enough cash reserves to afford an increase in rates, so massive bankruptcy is inevitable. Incidentally, monetizing debt is the same as bankruptcy, and locks in inflation, and consequently locks in a real loss in ROI, which is why the fed is unlikely to mint a couple trillion-dollar coins.

            Money, as opposed to currency, has three functions; A means of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. Wanton printing makes a mockery of the first- everybody wants a one way exchange- to exchange dollars as soon as they get them, hopelessly complicates the second and destroys the third. It is the last act of a desperate regime.

        I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true or fair to say that Jerome Powell is in over his head. He may be one of the only important persons in the Western world who isn‚Äôt. He is a very different animal from Bernanke and Yellen. They were academics; he is an old private equity guy with wizened experience of skin in the game. I consider him one of the very few beacons of sanity in this world, and I pray for him.

            Agree. The Fed chairman, that is, even an honest and sound man, has as much chance to steer a sound monetary policy now as, as Z has written, elections do in changing the ways of imbedded government in this era. And no one has sat over a shitstorm of this magnitude, inclunding 1929.

            Face rags enable enormous amounts of criminal activity.
They were illegal in the south for decades, because no one wanted to be outed as a KKK sympathizer.
Cameras are everywhere.  Storage is cheap.  Computerized facial recognition gets every better. Those in power on the left know that their shock troops won‚Äôt engage unless they can wear their masks to do their dirty work.

        JMHO.  The only thing in the long term that can save the dollar is for America to reindustrialize.    Real GDP, not phony GDP as counted by Washington, is what makes a  currency strong.   That would prove very difficult to impossible now due to our social capital.
America at this point just does not produce enough valuable and useful things.

            Reindustrialize would kill the dollar as the GFC ‚Äì and that would be a good thing.
You can‚Äôt have the GFC without trade deficits. Reindustrialize and those trade deficits go away, starving the global trading and banking system of dollars, forcing them to use other currencies.
The GFC and trade deficits go hand in hand.

                    Before the early 1970s, the dollar will implicitly linked to gold. You could argue that gold was the GFC. Most currencies were pegged to the dollar, but the dollar was pegged to gold.People used the dollar, but the real currency was gold.After we closed the gold window and the dollar became the end of the line, that‚Äôs when the deficits started to show up.If we reduced our trade deficits to zero, how would China, Europe and Japan get enough dollars to buy energy and food?The value of the dollar would skyrocket. That‚Äôs the irony of all this ‚Äúdeath of the dollar‚Äù talk. The dollar might die, but its death likely would be preceded by the dollar increasing in value ‚Äì dramatically.

                        ‚ÄúIf we reduced our trade deficits to zero, how would China, Europe and Japan get enough dollars to buy energy and food?‚ÄúThe value of the dollar would skyrocket.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs not correct. Why should these countries use dollars at all? No need. If China wants to buy oil and gas from Russia, or from Saudi, for that matter, it doesn‚Äôt need to use dollars.The real US economy is a small an declining percentage of the real world economy. That‚Äôs the crux of the problem. It‚Äôs not like the halcyon days of the immediate post-WW2 period, when the USA accounted for half the world‚Äôs GDP.Put another way, a country that has a small real economy cannot continue to have its currency as a reserve. And being a reserve currency the way the dollar has been is something with a limited lifespan. Eventually no-one wants to hold dollars because there is nothing to buy with them and even countries that had hitherto accepted them (like Saudi) now prefer to be paid in another currencies.

                        Arshad,You‚Äôre wrong on every point.‚ÄúWhy should these countries use dollars at all?‚ÄùThese countries may not need the dollar to buy some energy and food, but I‚Äôm talking about the entire world‚Äôs need for dollars. Most other countries will still need dollars to buy oil, nat gas and food.And what about other trade. Around 80% of trade globally is done in dollars. In North and South America, it‚Äôs 96%. In Asia, it‚Äôs 74%. Hell, even in Europe, it‚Äôs 20%.The world needs dollars to trade and that‚Äôs not just for oil. It‚Äôs everything.Just as importantly, there‚Äôs debt service. There‚Äôs $15 trillion in dollar-denominated debt outside the the US. Dollar debt makes up 60% of all world debt. Those debts need to be serviced and for that, you need dollars.So, no, a few trade deals using yuan and rubles isn‚Äôt going to change that anytime soon. It will someday, but it‚Äôs a long process.‚ÄúPut another way, a country that has a small real economy cannot continue to have its currency as a reserve.‚ÄùThe British pound was 55% of global reserves into the 1950s by which time, Britain‚Äôs economy was a joke. Britain‚Äôs economy and empire had been falling fast since the end of WWI, but it took another 30 years to finally see the end of the pound as the GFC.I‚Äôm not trying to defend the dollar or the neocons, but people need to understand that unseating the dollar will be a long process.But that process has begun.

That‚Äôs not correct. The point is they‚Äôre not going to be buying oil and nat gas from the USA. Why then to use dollars? If USD, why not Zimbabwean dollars, for that matter, with the same argument? Suppose Saudi, Kuwait, and UAE say, ‚ÄúYou can pay us in rubles or yuan.‚Äù Why then a need to hold dollars?

Not true.

        One thing to take into consideration is that Paul Volcker gave us a 30 year lifeline on the dollar because he concentrated on its internal value.  Part of the deal in having vast amounts of foreign wealth held in dollars is that it generally holds its internal value.  It‚Äôs not the Brazilian Real.  Given what‚Äôs been happening, the future inflation level will tell us how long the dollar has.  Even the current 6% level is not acceptable for them in the long term.  However, we get back to the sordid topic of national debt finance.  Interest rates are sort of at a ceiling right now, so if inflation goes to 7%, 8% or more from here, there‚Äôs no brakes on the car.

                    Agreed.  Just anecdotally based on my own basket of goods, it feels like about 15%.  As a double check, having lived through the 70s, I can attest it feels pretty similar.  The BLS calculations were changed in the late 90s to drive down the official inflation measure, implementing circular calculations like changing product weightings for high/low inflation items (substitution effect), trying to filter out product improvements, and swapping out home prices for esoteric comparable rent calculations.

        Don‚Äôt mean to be fanciful but Say‚Äôs Law notes that goods and services are exchanged for goods and services. Money in the form of currency makes it more efficient. But money could be anything used to set prices for exchange. Units of energy measured on some reliable scale. Credits discounted for the time value of savings/consumption measured in minutes, hours, days etc. accompanied by enforceable payment schedules while gambling unto derivates into the quadrillions could render money markets meaningless.

                Correct.  But now we are seeing a revelation of a ‚Äúmentally ill‚Äù person as illustrated by her ‚Äútransition‚Äù and her social media support environment.  This is why I never mince words describing these *delusional, mentally ill* individuals.  They are sick people, not just folk marching to a different drummer.Of course, the other side is fighting‚Äîwith MSM full support‚Äîto control/regain the narrative.  The alternative narrative being that societal repression of trans people made this person into a killer.  Lot‚Äôs of mention of the current bills in many legislatures to rein in Drag Queen story hours and irreversible medical ‚Äútransition‚Äù procedures before the age of 18 yo.And the ‚ÄúClown Show‚Äù marches on‚Ä¶.

        Btw, the irony of the Eurodollar system that so dominates the world and that Russia is trying to defeat is that it was create by the Soviet Union.In the 1950s, the Soviets had accumulated a lot of dollars held in US banks. Fearful, that the US might seize those dollars, it moved them to European banks. However, the Soviets didn‚Äôt want to convert the dollars to the local currencies because it needed dollars for trade settlements (sound familiar) so it keep the money denominated in dollar but held at European banks.The banks then started to make dollar-denominated loans using those Soviet dollar deposits and discovered that it was far better than making loans in all kinds of currencies, which was costly, cumbersome and less stable that dollars.Thus, the Eurodollar system was born. And it continues to dominate to this day.

            In the late last century, the Argentina banks had dollar denominated accounts.  Lots of people opened them and used them as an alternative store of wealth to the Argentina peso.  Not a problem.One day, without warning, the government seized all these accounts and converted them to pesos at the current rate.  The Courts held this action as legal as the account holders suffered no ‚Äúloses‚Äù.  Then, within weeks, the government let the valise of the peso ‚Äúfloat‚Äù against the dollar.  The depositors who formally had dollars, took a 50% haircut on their pesos.Argentina soon fell into bankruptcy and hyperinflation, and remain their till this day.

One little old lady I was acquainted with had USD 200,000. That became $67,000 in the blink of an eye. After that Argentinians started keeping their dollars in their mattresses.As for hyperinflation, Argentina has been through that several times since WW2. But it used to be a prosperous country before 1914.

        I‚Äôm not an economist, but I can spot the strong horse, the not as strong horse, and the weak horse, so I can recognize that the Euro will fail before the US dollar does. That‚Äôs the canary in the coal mine lens through which I look at this.Corollated: I‚Äôve posted before that the ultimate power move to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the dollar would be to wreck the Euro and force Europe into using the USD. I don‚Äôt know if the brain trust is smart enough to do that, but it is ruthless enough.The petrodollar, while important, is not as important as some folks make it out to be. It is roughly 10% of the reserve currency edifice, in terms of number of dollars involved. It could represent a different percentage in terms of confidence, hard to say what.One doesn‚Äôt normally think of sodomy as an important factor in currency wars but in clown world it‚Äôs a critical point. Power A wants me to use its currency and demands I promote sodomy. Will sanction me if I don‚Äôt promote sodomy, sanctions I open myself up to by using its currency. Power B wants me to use its currency and doesn‚Äôt care about my country‚Äôs internal buggering norms. Hmmm. Hard choice.

                    The better choice is to go back to using local currencies.  The Euro was only introduced like 24 years ago.  The Euro has been the root of monetary troubles for over 2 decades. Greece and Germany should not be using the same currency.
The whole EU project is one big exercise in expert management failure.

The Southern European countries have been deindustrialized and impoverished because of the Euro but the system has not collapsed, thank you to the creative finance and constant propaganda our elites are so fond of.
Of course, the Euro is doomed to fail but, as the Keynes saying goes, ‚ÄúMarkets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.‚Äù. After decades of waiting my time to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù, I am still waiting.

        It‚Äôs telling that Russia and China were very prepared for the currency war and the sanctions against Russia. Putin knew that invading Ukraine was (potentially) going to be wider war than just military actions.Putin and Xi have been working on this problem for a very long time. Both stopped adding to their treasury reserves around ten years ago.But this war goes beyond governments and their holding of treasuries. A big part of this war will come down to whether the banks will want to continue using the dollar as their main currency for settlements and making loans. The Eurodollar system predates the petrodollar. Non-US Banks were making loans in dollars to non-US borrowers, not because someone forced them to do it, but because it made sense.And that‚Äôs still the case today. That need for dollars also means that banks need to hold a lot of treasuries on their books.The problem with unseating the dollar is that there‚Äôs really no good alternatives. When the British pound finally died, it was because the dollar was a better alternative. As bad as the Americans are, the yuan and the ruble don‚Äôt look much safer.Then, there‚Äôs the issue that the neither China nor Russia run trade deficits, so how are companies, banks and governments supposed to get their currency. They also don‚Äôt have liquid and secure treasury markets. Finally, China doesn‚Äôt want to be the GRC. They‚Äôve seen what it did to the US economy.A GRC is extremely convenient. It‚Äôll be hard to replace it with a multi-currency system. That said, the belligerence of the neocons is forcing the world to move toward that system. There really is no other choice. No one is willing to live under neocon rule anymore.The BRICs face a very tall task. They

            Great post and explanation. You (Citizen) know this, but for others‚Äô benefit here I would just point out that there are trillions ‚Äì yes trillions ‚Äì of Eurodollar debts around the world that must be serviced or refinanced into something other than dollars to dislodge the dollar as GRC. This will take many many years.
You also importantly point out the Triffin Paradox. Perhaps Bitcoin could have solved this, maybe it still could, but The US is at war against Bitcoin too.

                You‚Äôre correct. And you bring up a subtle but important issue. The dollar is the GRC, but the US treasury is the global reserve asset (GRA). There‚Äôs a difference.The dollar could remain the GRC (or, at least, the main trading currency) while the treasury is unseated as the GRA. Central banks and banks hold treasuries to quickly access dollars in an emergency, but what if another asset ‚Äì gold, bitcoin, some commodity-back asset ‚Äì takes over the roll of treasuries?I see that as more of a possibility that the dollar being unseated as the GRC.That would be just as devastating to the US as losing the dollar as the GRC. It would mean that the world wouldn‚Äôt need to buy treasuries, which would mean that we would have to finance our own government debt, which would mean either higher interest rates (causing less spending) or monetizing the debt (inflation).I‚Äôve always seen this as about treasuries more than the dollar, though, obviously, they‚Äôre related.

                        Interest rates are higher, but those rates haven‚Äôt hit the vast, vast majority of the federal debt. Not all the debt comes due each year. It‚Äôll take around five years for the vast majority of the federal debt to rollover and need to be refinanced.Only a small portion of the federal debt is currently being hit by the new, higher interest rates. But every month, that percentage grows. As it does, the govt will either need to cut spending, increase taxes or increase the deficit.As to the Fed buying gov debt, that stopped last year. The Fed has been letting its balance sheet shrink since the summer. The private bond market is absorbing US debt issuance. We‚Äôll see how long that lasts.Regardless, as of the moment, the higher rates are only just beginning to impact the US govt budget and the Fed is not buying US bonds anymore.

                The West didn‚Äôt seize $300 billion. That was the story early last year, but since then it has come to light that the West, in a search for Russian assets, could only find just under $40 billion. So the GAE can‚Äôt even be a competent thief.

                    It‚Äôs because the WH and the treasury dept kept the seizure secret from the Fed and the banks. When the WH announced it, the Fed and the banks were caught off guard. This gave the Russians time to grab their money.
But the reason that the WH kept it secret is because it knew that the Fed and the banks would oppose the move.

                I suspect that much if whatever was seized (including shit like superyachts) was monies of the oligarchs, removed by these criminals and traitors from their own nation, so why the hell would Russia be sad about that? Obviously, they can get some PR mileage from grumping about these seizures, but their is that maskirovka again.

                To be the GRC, you have to run trade deficits. Otherwise, how  will foreign businesses and central banks get the dollars that they need to buy, in this case, energy and food, which are sold in dollars.(The world also needs dollars to service its dollar-denominated debts, though most of that comes from the Eurodollar system.)So, the US has to run trade deficits. But which countries would it run trade deficits? Well, countries that use a lot of energy and need to import food. That would be manufacturing countries (energy) that also have a large population, so Germany and Japan originally and, later, China.Basically, the petrodollar system meant that the US would run trade deficits in manufacturing. Naturally, this would devastate the US manufacturing sector, which is exactly what happened from the 1970s to today.But the petrodollar system was great for Wall Street (it made the dollar the center of the financial world) and Washington (the dollar was a powerful weapon). Given that DC and NYC hate the Rust Belt, they were fine with that trade-off.China, OTOH, doesn‚Äôt seem to hate its people, so it has no desire to lose it manufacturing sector to become the GFC. That‚Äôs why it wants a multi-currency world. There are economic costs to being the GFC which eventually cause the dominate power to decline and lose GFC status.Triffin‚Äôs Dilemma.

                    I‚Äôm wondering what the Chicoms‚Äô bargain with the Chinese is. Not knowledgeable about their politics.If it‚Äôs increasing prosperity for power, isn‚Äôt that the same trap the US fell into? Americans have been bought off.I guess the Chinese have a much larger internal market to develop, but I‚Äôm doubtful that they‚Äôre so virtuous to remain a nation of humble farmers and laborers, when it‚Äôs literally easier to get educated, get a desk job, and start investing. That right there would eventually demand trade deficits, right? And of course, I wonder if their ambitious could resist temptation if opportunity presents itself. Kind of like how when the Cold War ended, it was like somebody flipped a switch here.I‚Äôm dumb on the financial and economic aspects, but I‚Äôm wondering how much human nature and internal politics play into these things.And as far as Breton Woods, I don‚Äôt know much about it, but I do know the end of WWII was a revolutionary moment in the US. Different elite factions with different priorities grabbed the wheel.I think the present is one of those globally revolutionary moments, and the players involved will be changed by it, I‚Äôm not certain how. Probably good to look at who‚Äôs on the come-up, what cultural trends are brewing, etc.

The industrial heartland, not so much.
The queer Keynes tried to create a better system, but Washington crushed that idea because it knew that there was power in being the GFC.

                Well, the Bretton Woods conference would seem to indicate that GRC was completely intentional. The Marshall Plan was entirely about making the US the reserve, for it placed cash in the hands of countries, creating US debt, in order for those countries to do buisness in US dollars.

                    True. But it was the Eurodollar system that emerged that really cemented the dollar as the GFC ‚Äì along with the petrodollar deal. And the Eurodollar system grew organically. It wasn‚Äôt mandated by the US.
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôll harder to unseat the dollar than people think. It‚Äôs not just about the US government. It‚Äôs about the Eurodollar system used by banks and companies around the world.

                        The questions was about the GRC. I do, however, completely agree with you about the lack of a sudden swap. Again, this reason is why I do not agree with those that expect an End-of-the-world event. I believe this is the end of the world as we know it ‚Äì a gradual slide into decreasing quality of life. This is why I am also completely pessimistic about an event that awakens the masses. We will just get used to crappier and crappier lives.

I think you are correct about the slow decline. The controllers of the West are transitioning their societies to the Algerian model.
The biggest tell is how they‚Äôve normalized people dropping like flies from coincidences, almost like that was the plan all along.

            Thanks, that is a very helpful comment. From what I gather, the takeaway so far is not that the dollar will be replaced in the immediate future, but that it no longer can necessarily deliver a fatal blow. Exhibit A for the former is Russia survived and thrived to the apparent surprise of D.C. As you wrote in a responsive comment, Russia seems to have better prepared to deal with the economic sanctions than Washington anticipated.Perceptions can be reality. The dollar still is king, but its power is diminished and it is no longer as vigorous even if the successor remains unknown. As Z wrote, extending its rule would require talent not apparent in the apparat. The takeaway from the Ukraine madness thus far is whether or not the end to American supremacy is near, its once-unchallenged dominance already is wounded. The contraction soon will begin if it has not already done so.

                Yeah, you don‚Äôt need to completely unseat the dollar. You just need to be able to do enough trade ‚Äì especially for energy ‚Äì in other currencies to survive the sanctions.My analogy is a highway system. Let‚Äôs say that there‚Äôs this big, well-designed highway system that lets you travel the country. It‚Äôs great, super convenient.But over time, the cops that patrol the highway start to arrest people for no good reason and sometimes impound your car. Well, despite the ease and convenience of the highway system, you‚Äôre going to start looking for alternatives, but there are none.So, some wealthy drivers get together and carve out some dirt roads. Sure, those roads aren‚Äôt as reliable or convenient as the highway, but there‚Äôs no cops on them either. You don‚Äôt even have to use the dirt road all the time, just when the cops start getting pushy.You don‚Äôt need to completely replace the highway system to cause the cops to lose a lot of their power. You just need some alternative. And, btw, maybe over time, some people start to put down some gravel on those dirt roads, and then they pave a few of them. Next thing you know, there‚Äôs alternative highway system.Also, don‚Äôt focus only on the dollar. Treasury bonds are the other part of this. If the dollar remains the GFC but companies, banks and central banks find an alternative to treasuries to store their wealth, that would cause the US the same amount of pain as losing the dollar as the GFC.

                Jack, the question is even broader and probably scarier: how will the neoncons react when the dollar starts to fade, and consequently American global power? I see no evidence that they will be content with even being a big player in the major league. These nutters want total power. It‚Äôs a zero sum game for them.

They know that the dollar is the key to US power. Let‚Äôs just say that neocons understand banking and trade. Allowing trade and banking in other currencies is the end of the US as world‚Äôs single great power.
We‚Äôll still be extremely powerful, but we won‚Äôt have the ability to tell China and Russia what to do and we‚Äôll have a much harder time bullying other countries by economic means.
I can‚Äôt see the neocons allowing that without some form of serious fight.

            Russia and China are working on a new global currency, likely a few years out, Looks to be commodity/Energy/Gold backed. In the meantime the BRICS economies are now larger than the G7 ones (plus the rest of the EU).Africa‚Äôs done with the old colonial powers, both Macron and Sholtz were openly mocked during their recent visits.As the Arabs say, the dogs bark and the caravan moves on.

        YES, give Z another Pulitzer for coining eternal terminology. ‚ÄúDong into dollars‚Äù will now live in infamy as a double, triple, even quadruple entendre. But on to the topic at hand.All fiat currencies are founded upon confidence in the issuer by the public-at-large. When that confidence evaporates, you get things like bank runs (see Silicon Valley Bank as an example). What the rest of the world sees in the USA right now is a dementia patient in the White House selling trannyism and endless sovereign debt as if it were a valuable commodity. And the coterie of politicians and string-pullers that surround him are equally insane. Finally, average citizen Joe Normie appears content to let ‚Äúthe good times roll‚Äù so no fix is in the offing. All of this is locked in with Fortified for Democracy vote manufacturing.Why would any sane person anywhere on the planet have confidence in the USA? Or its currency?

            I‚Äôll play devil‚Äôs advocate here.The Eurodollar system has been around since the late 1950s. It will not be unseated easily. How are banks and companies supposed to do business in yuan or rubles. Both countries have capital controls. Both countries have tiny and controlled treasuries markets.The only other currency even in the universe of the dollar is the Euro and who wants to use that. Look, I hate the neocons, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that as of the moment, there‚Äôs no alternative to the dollar.That said, the BRICs are working on building an alternative multi-currency system. But that will take time, and it will be hard to convince banks and businesses to adopt it. A GRC is incredibly convenient for trade and banking.However, the insanity of the neocons is everyone‚Äôs best ally in pushing the world to move away from the dollar.

                It is a bit of straw man here. My post clearly stated that the dollar is not going away. Instead, it will face competition with rival currencies. The Russians demanding and getting payment in rubles was a huge turning point. China is now demanding payment in yuan. Yeah, flim-flam companies selling useless apps are not issuing debt in yuan or rubles. No one is rushing to trade their euro bonds or treasuries for bonds in rubles or yuan or dong. Not yet, anyway.The transition will take time, but the transition has started. There will be no rolling back to the 1980‚Äôs where the world was happy to let Washington control the global currency.

                    Totally agree. Both sides seem to be getting these developments wrong.The dollar haters seem to think that this spells the immediate end to the dollar as the GFC. The other side acts like the trade deals are a joke because countries will likely take those rubles or yuan and convert them back to dollars.That‚Äôs not the point. The point is that they‚Äôre breaking down the current system ‚Äì both mentally and physically. They‚Äôre taking the first baby steps to creating alternative methods trade settlement and banking mechanisms.It‚Äôll take time. They‚Äôll be mistakes. Etc. But the process has begun. The next big step is figuring out alternative reserve assets. Treasuries have as big a lock on the system as dollars.Gold is the obvious choice. Yeah, it‚Äôs cumbersome, but you can also keep it in your own vault. A commodity-based asset could work but it might be too volatile.Regardless, these issues can all be sorted out over time. The key is that the process moves forward.

                If Brandon and the Fed succeed in pushing inflation into the hypersphere, then people everywhere will flee from the dollar just like a bank run. Black markets and barter will grow in the dark as a homegrown alternative, but right now Russia is doing everything right, showing great patience, and their currency is backed by ginormous O&amp;G reserves, ditto for coal &amp; key minerals, a substantial manufacturing base, and a dominant Slavic demographic. If (or when) US inflation exceeds 20%, the ruble is going to look pretty God Damn good as an alternative to the dollar. Where is the light at the end of the tunnel for the US economy? I don‚Äôt see it.

        Recent arbitrary asset seizure and other abuses of what is supposed to be a transparent, fair, unbiased trade settlement currency is the greatest mistake the US has ever made. But don‚Äôt worry, Putin is a real jerk, so it is worth it.

        Given that the Chinese Yuan has an exchange rate (more or less) pegged to the Dollar by the Chinese central bank, it is a long way from becoming an alternative to the Dollar. The functional reality of this Dollar-Yuan peg is that the Chinese reserve currency is the Dollar until such time as the Yuan floats freely versus the Dollar. Meanwhile, there are capital controls in China too.That said, Zman is completely correct that economics always happens at the margin. The US has given the world plenty of reasons to find an alternative. So foreigners will chip away at the Dollar‚Äôs status gradually for the rest of our lives.It will be a race between our total societal collapse and our currency‚Äôs reserve-status collapse.

            This is correct. When Chinese get rich, they buy a lot of U.S. real estate. But with the U.S. regime unstable, the yuan and ruble still will be preferred for an increasing number of transactions. That will destabilize the dollar system. You see that in the recent rise in the gold price toward $2,000 from $1,800 (meaning a decline in the dollar‚Äôs value). For once, Peter Schiff is right, but still probably too alarmist. If the Fed pushes that back to $1,800, it will mean they are aware of the need for stabilization in the currency war, which will continue.

        I sometimes wonder if a part of the reason why the US won‚Äôt negotiate a Russia/Ukraine settlement is that they can‚Äôt even agree on which faction would go to the negotiating table.The US is in the middle of orchestrating a revolution against itself. It wants a new flag, a new history (more like a Year Zero), a new people, a new social organization (public/private racial caste and spoils system replacing a public of the latter but a private mostly meritocratic system), a new justice system. The revolution means waging war on its warrior caste.That seems like a lot of tigers by the tail at the same time that your empire requires significant economic structural reforms that will already introduce political instability.It is quite a remarkable and breathtaking ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know what to call it. As we go through the reforms you would think you would need to honor the people to get them to make the sacrifices and row in one direction. Instead they are waging war against the nation. How can you salvage the nation and theThere is something here that doesn‚Äôt meet the eye. It makes you wonder, is DC itself some bazaar that long ago gave up sovereignty and is run by the whims of whichever foreign sovereign can bribe some ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù satrap who holds political office or a powerful bureaucratic office?It just feels like maybe there really is no America. It is a printing press and some nukes and whoever mans those buttons or pays whoever mans those buttons is really what America is. It is hard to make any sense of this dumpster fire.

        Republicans being stuck in the 80s is one of their biggest turn-offs‚Äô to me.  Every politician and media personality from that era never shuts up about Reagan this and Reagan that.  Democrats are focused on the future, while Republicans are focused on the past.  Furthermore, there is no reason to believe things will get better because the people in power are a bunch of dingbats.  Seriously, I cringe so hard when I listen to the authority figures in this country open their dumb mouths.

        It has been posited by others who are better informed than I that Fed Chair Powell is actually engaged in a war against the European globalists, on behalf of American banking interests.  If so, then I am compelled to root for him.  Not that I favor American banks or those who run them, but the alternative is a globohomo totalitarian state, run by the good folks at WEF who are slavering over the prospect of installing their brand of leadership over us.  I do not think Powell is either stupid or uninformed, and am therefore inclined to accept this analysis.  OTOH, the Biden cabal is composed entirely of stupid and ideologically driven lunatics whose goal is to deconstruct traditional America and replace it with a constituency that is either fully ‚Äúwoke‚Äù (i.e., intent upon stealing whitey‚Äôs stuff and redistributing it to all the queers, non-whites and other societal detritus whose votes they wish to garner) or represents the underclass which desires only the time and opportunity to prey upon the corpse of traditional America while getting high and buggering each other while awaiting the opportunity to do likewise to our children.  Biden, of course is simply following the orders of his masters, whether here or in Beijing, Kiev or Brussels, in order to keep this corruption under wraps and keep the grift going.  Thus, his priority is to keep the money machine cranking and handing out worthless dollars until the bust-out is complete.

                WEF is just an organization of elites, not the other way around.  It‚Äôs the equivalent of saying that McDonald‚Äôs runs the world if they met at a McDonald‚Äôs in Chicago instead of a hotel in Davos.

            I largely agree. I do think Powell (and other big financial dogs) are way smarter than the political/media class, and despite working in the Swamp, they are not necessarily swamp creatures nor managerial goons.They do have a lot to lose if they f**k things up. Sure, they can escape to New Zealand if SHTF, but they‚Äôd much rather live in Georgetown or Manhattan and be talked about on TV. At worst, in a collapse scenario, they‚Äôd be strung up. Down here among the dirt people, we tend to think that the elite are worry-less, but they are not.Personally I think Jaime Dimon and his ilk just dismiss the crackpots in Washington. Biden can say whatever J*wish pansexual immigrant staffer tells him. He‚Äôs supposed to. But the real power is in the financial sector. I‚Äôll bet the higher-ups in the financial sector are not into DEI, and I‚Äôll bet many are more racist than we are.

            You‚Äôre referring to the Tom Luongo ‚ÄúTheory of Everything.‚Äù He tried to explain it on the Duran podcast, but he‚Äôs a bit scatter-brained when he tries to explain his theory, and he uses a lot of jargon that‚Äôs hard to follow. Here‚Äôs the video:https://rumble.com/v2efdjg-the-fed-and-the-ecb-w-tom-luongo-live.htmlThis blogger has broken down the theory into a coherent presentation:https://harrisonburge.substack.com/p/jerome-powell-this-fourth-turningsIgnore the opening stuff about the fourth turning and skip down to the ‚ÄúTeam America‚Äù section. Briefly, the West is in a financial war between globalists like Klaus Schwab and George Soros (The Davos Crowd) and the FED backed NY banks. The Davos Crowd wants to collapse the US in a financial crisis in order to implement the great reset, which will set up a digital currency under control of the globalists. The FED and the NY banks like the commercial banking system because it makes them rich, and Powell has gone to war to destroy the Davos Crowd.The Davos Crowd depends on dollars, and Powell has moved to destroy the offshore dollar market.  The FED has stopped the flow of dollars into offshore banks and is raising interest rates to break the Europeans.  The European central banks cannot print money, and they no longer can get money from the FED at 0% interest. The cost to their activist banks just went up, and so did their ESG, climate change, and transgender programs.Interest rates will affect US banks too, but its collateral damage in the major war against the Davos Crowd. As Tom Luongo says, it‚Äôs a big poop sandwich and everyone has to take a bite, but the Davos Crowd has to take a bigger bite.

                I don‚Äôt know what to make of Luongo‚Äôs theory. It is certainly plausible, but as you say, he has trouble explaining it. He‚Äôs also very defensive about it and won‚Äôt accept any criticism. That‚Äôs off-putting, but doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs wrong. I guess we‚Äôll find out.

            Notionally backed by gold. It was not *really* backed by gold. The world understood that America would create the necessary dollars to build out the empire and rebuild the provinces in Europe. No one would actually try to swap their dollar reserves for gold, as that would give the game away. Then France made a run on the gold reserves and Nixon closed the gold window, settling off a period of currency reform ending in the Louvre Accords.

        I don‚Äôt believe there is a solution for these currency wars except to let them play out on the trajectory the war is currently on. That trajectory in the West is raging inflation. There is no way off this train without a massive cut in spending to allow fed policies to work. Who believes our elites have the willpower to trim spending? The fed is in an inflation trap which cannot be exited without either demolishing Wall Street or unleashing a middle-class-destroying inflation. I think we know which choice our betters will make.

            Epaminondas:  To cut spending means to cut entitlement programs, particularly those beloved of White silents/boomers like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as well as those expected by blaq and mestizo baby mommas and daddies and their spawn, such as SNAP (food stamps).  All together that‚Äôs 65% of the present budget.That‚Äôs what so many who preach about cutting foreign aid miss (of course such a thing should not exist, but that‚Äôs beside the point).  Or the MIC.  We waste most of what we spend, regardless of budget category.People are addicted to both cheap Chinese manufacturing and federal redistributive gibs.  Both have been financed via exporting both manufacturing ability/jobs and exporting inflation caused by massive printing of fiat dollars backed by nothing substantive.While it may not be strictly true that individual, hard-working White heritage Americans ‚Äòdeserve‚Äô the hard economic times coming, the GAE most definitely does.

                Social Security is a relatively easy fix.  Raise the retirement age for young people to 70 and remove the income caps.  The fact they can‚Äôt even do that tells you how impossible reform is.  Medicare is the tough nut.  Everyone needs healthcare, and it is expensive regardless of how it is paid for.

        ‚ÄúFor starters, the petrodollar is not a real thing. It is simply a term to express the fact that in the 1970‚Äôs the large oil producing countries agreed to use the dollar. ‚Ä¶ Now, why did the Saudis agree to price everything in dollars. The main reason is they got something for it in return. What they got is a guarantee that the United States would protect the kingdom from threats in the region‚ÄùThere‚Äôs more to it than that. The US (Kissinger specifically) threatened military action if they didn‚Äôt price oil in dollars. Secondly, they couldn‚Äôt just do anything with the dollars. Specifically they couldn‚Äôt buy up US companies. They had to recycle their money through New York banks. These banks then accumulated so many ‚Äúpetrodollars‚Äù they didn‚Äôt know what to do with them and started lending them to any third world country that would take them. The various debt crises in the third world during the ‚Äô80s originated in these ill-conceived loans. Or if not recycle their money through US banks, the OPEC countries had to buy US treasuries. That‚Äôs why the Saudi king was complaining to Carter about high US inflation in the late ‚Äô70s ‚Äî it meant the real rate on Saudi-held treasuries had become negative.‚ÄúThat last part is important. Joe Biden, as Vice President,  sided with the faction opposing Mohammed bin Salman, the current Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. ‚Ä¶This is why the Saudis are now open to pricing their energy products in Chinese yuan and maybe other currencies.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs some truth in this. MBS doesn‚Äôt like this worthless and contemptible creature. But it goes deeper. The structural realities have changed. Firstly, the dollar is no longer undergirded by a strong manufacturing economy. The only thing undergirding it is perhaps sales of wheat and other agribusiness products. Maybe add some weapon sales. The yuan is undergirded by a manufacturing economy. The ruble is undergirded by oil and gas. That is one key reality. Secondly, the US military is no longer able to function credibly as the muscle arm of the extortion gangster regime that is the USA. Other powers can provide not only security guarantees but also guarantees against a rapacious power like the USA. We should not underestimate the power of the US military in propping up the international acceptance of the dollar. Arguably it was unhappiness with the dollar standard that led to Saddam and Gaddafi beng ousted.Behind all of this is the unhappy realisation that the USA is not acting as a stable hegemon. It is breaking any of the rules, or all of the rules, any time it feels like it. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äúrules‚Äôbased international order‚Äù). If Russian assets can be sequestered and confiscated by the USA at whim, what security does any country have whose reserves are kept in dollars? If the USA can does do regime change at whim, who is next on the list?

        Lost on the normal news watcher in the US is that America gets at least as much of its power not from shiny sexy military toys, but from the ability to punish enemies with economic sanctions.  This has been mightily enhanced with the global reserve status of the dollar.  China and Russia are tired of this, and the whole world is getting wise to the long con that is exporting American debt via mass inflation.Been interesting to see Russia resist not just the US military power, but the economic sanctions as well.  It seems that a country can survive, even thrive, without a Starbucks OR a McDonalds.‚Äî-Middle East is a bit of a puzzle though.  Hard to imagine China stepping up with military security guarantees with boots on the ground in the Saud Kingdom. China could bankroll it, Russia could Wager group contract it out.  The Saudis don‚Äôt much care who their mercenaries are, as long at they do what they‚Äôre supposed to do.

In the last year, India ‚Äì Chinese commerce has increased 30%, in large part due to the mediation of Russia, but also the confluence of interests with regards to the American empire.

            Sanctions have never really worked. Both Cuba and Iran have both survived them to differing degrees. As for the Chinese in the ME, geopolitics, like nature, hates a vaccuum. The Saudis know that the US has reneged on its part of the petrodollar deal and is now seeking protection and security elsewhere. It‚Äôs quite staggering to see not just how quickly the neocons have destroyed 70 years of US diplomacy by bringing China and Russia together, but how in even less time, they have completely destroyed their long term strategy for the ME. Amazing times!

        Short answer to ‚Äúare the elites up to this?‚Äù  No.  Washington is the equivalent of the dissipated third generation being handed the family business.  Literally.  They‚Äôve got all the ‚Äúright‚Äù educational cattle brands and pedigrees, but most seem dumber than stumps.  Apologies to stumps. I‚Äôm just a nobody with history degree (albeit a good one) who feels like I‚Äôve been watching this come over the horizon for more than a couple decades.  Timing was the only open question.  Further to that theory is the elite is just smart enough to pick as much as they can off the carcass for themselves and their families and hunker down.  Hoping the mob won‚Äôt come for them.

            The elite are treating America (and by extension, the entire Western world) the same way Paul Cicero and his crew treated the poor indebted restaurant owner who came to Paulie for help in an early scene of ‚ÄúGoodFellas.‚Äù‚ÄúNow the guy‚Äôs got Paulie as a partner. Any problems, he goes to Paulie. Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie. Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy‚Ä¶he can call Paulie. But now the guy‚Äôs got to come up with Paulie‚Äôs money every week. No matter what. Business bad?! F*** you, pay me. Oh, you had a fire?! F*** you, pay me. The place got hit by lightning, huh?! F*** you, pay me. Also, Paulie could do anything. Especially run up bills on the joint‚Äôs credit. And why not? Nobody‚Äôs gonna pay for it anyway. And as soon as the deliveries are made in the front door, you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount. You take a two hundred dollar case of booze and you sell it for a hundred. It doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs all profit. And then finally, when there‚Äôs nothing left, when you can‚Äôt borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of booze, you bust the joint out. You light a match‚Ä¶‚ÄùWe are now entering the bust out phase of the Global American Empire.

            Sami, as someone with a good history degree, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll recognise all the hallmarks of a dying Empire. The latter days of the Western Roman Empire saw an occassional diamond-in-the-rough decent emperor pop up, but the majority where the same feckless grifters and Beta-boy maroons we have to suffer in the West today
