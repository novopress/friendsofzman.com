        Tubbie has a nice ring to it, although it reminds me of Teletubbies. You are right, this is another knife to the heart of the South. While there are pockets of Liberty-loving patriots all over the country, the South seems to have the highest concentration, therefore must be humiliated and/or repressed whenever possible by the Hive Left.

        Three thoughts on this:a) When Trump destroys the Lizard Queen in the general he will reverse this idiocy. It would take all of three minutes to sign an executive order.b) If, God forbid, he isn’t elected and this goes forward we should all buy some red and black Sharpies (waterproof, remember) and deface the bills. This would force Treasury to take them out of circulation.c) If you are offered any at a bank or in change at a store, refuse them and insist on 1s, 5s or 10s instead.Widespread use of tactics b &amp; c would insure they would go the way of the Susan B. Anthony $1 coin into oblivion.Zman is right. This is a cultural assault on white, male, Southern history and identity.Just one more huge middle-finger from our mulatto Occupier-in-Chief.

            That’s pretty naive.Besides the fact that it’s probably illegal to deface bills, banks and shops will refuse to take them from you. That’s an expensive attempt to get them out of circulation. Worse, the media will treat any defaced bill as a hate-crime on par with a terrorist attack. They’d feast on each case. They’ll have items on the news about how some people refuse to accept these notes, leading to even more money spent on grievance mongering.Say thank you that they haven’t replaced “In God We Trust” with “We Believe in Global Warming”. Only when/if people are so fed up of all of this and the government refuses to give a penny to professional grievance-mongering groups will the situation improve.

        I think it’s more about destroying any link to the past, good or bad.  Not necessarily southern white men.  I was born in the north and I’m disgusting by all of it.  As if our history began with our current leader, forward.  It’s more evident if on the same day a department store (Target) comes out in favor of trans restrooms, the end goal becomes clear.  If a countryman doesn’t have a link to his past, what will he and his offspring become or how will they be identified as?  To a point when you speak of your history you are seen as some anomaly or racist believer in old white guys.  No tradition or foundation.  Nothing pass on.  I don’t recognize the country of my youth anymore.  My memories are of another time.  Eventually that time will not have existed.  But to your point,  John Grisham was interviewed by Der Spiegel and he too blamed poor southern white men for supporting Trump.  But he’d vote for our current leader a third time if he could as well as Hillary.  He’s from Arkansas apparently.  I just don’t get the hate on for other members of our society/country.

        Is it so hard to believe that the Orwellian Left is trying to rewrite history to disassociate themselves with their history of racism?I doubt that it’s a coincidence that, in a time when being called “racist” is worse than being accused of child molestation, the Left is suddenly trying to make all of their racist ancestors unpersons. Wilson, Calhoun, your southern generals…all are in the process of being erased from history. Not (just) because of hatred for the South, but because those people associate the Left with the racism of their past. And if any of their uninformed, useful idiot followers hear of these associations, there’s a possibility that they may actually realize that Leftism is a scam built on lies.

        There is no reason why, given the degree of sophistication in printed money such as watermarks and the quality of the paper among other things, why there can’t be portraits of lots of people both male and female. In the UK we have the queen on the front of our five pound note and on the other side, Elizabeth Fry (she of the reformed prisons and soup kitchen business, and Quaker to boot). In the States you could have Mrs Obumble on one side of your twenty dollar bill and the sainted Nancy Pelosi on the other side. Or you could have half a dozen portraits of offended college students (of mixed gender variations) on one side of some twenty bills and selected Ferguson activists on the other side. Mix and match, I say.Over on this side of the water I eagerly awaiting the first muslim portrait on our currency, as you would expect.

            That is an excellent idea. Obama should be on a million dollar bill. Or hundred million. Perfect. That will be the price of a gallon of gas just before the Moslem takeover.  I am the proud owner of a few 100 trillion $ bills from Zimbabwe. Considering the incredible number, all they thought to put on the front of the bill was a stack of three big rocks. But enough about Obama.

        Well, within five years, it’s entirely possible that $20 will be worth about the same as a quarter today. Trump will be President, and he’ll just direct the Fed to stop printing any denomination less than a hundred dollar bill, and the coinage will be revalued from cents to dollars, where one “old cent” equals one new dollar. That way the old coinage will be able to circulate side-by-side with the new coinage. And we’ll be rid of this retarded social experiment.
Sadly, this is about the best possible outcome that I can imagine.

        I care nothing for Andrew Jackson except that he’s a useful tool for the Zman to make an acerbic case for a broader culture, of which Jackson is the least and poorest example. Tubman’s mythology on the face of a $20 unsecured loan from the National Treasury is rather apt.

Jackson is vilified because of his Americanism. The ruling cult has loads of narrow fetishes, but underneath it all is a deep self-loathing. That old Puritan revulsion is the engine of American liberalism. As I’m fond of saying, the world would be a much better place if the Mayflower had sunk in the North Atlantic.

                According to Old dude, the Mayflower did sink (was sunk) and replaced by a fake replacement ship, crewed by Masons.

                Yes, but… The Vikings got there earlier, so you could all be named Sven Obumble, or Kjell Allthewhites now if the Mayflower hadn’t turned up. Plus, with the Vikes you could all the benefits of socialist Sweden and none of the drawbacks, such as… um, well, having to let lots of equatorial-tanned people in to boost the population… oh, wait…

                Judging from his farewell address, Jackson was exponentially more sophisticated than any President of the 20th or 21st century. He had the measure of everybody and everything. Tocqueville agreed. The fact that he shot men in duels, danced on tables, and held a low opinion of Indians, Negros, and Whigs of course disqualifies him to the citizen of today, who are born noble and enlightened. He was early America’s Trump, the difference being both the politician and the voter were far more well versed in government in Jackson’s day, so there was a higher bar. And, a huge plus, women, Negros, debtors, and people hostile to the US didn’t vote. Tocqueville, 1831–“On scrutinizing the Constitution of the United States….it is frightening to note how many differences of knowledge and discernment it assumes in those governed. I have scarcely ever encountered a single man of the common people in America who did not perceive with surprising ease the obligations entailed in the laws of Congress and the beginnings to the laws of his own state, nor who could not separate the matters belonging to the general prerogatives of the Union from those regulated by his local legislature and who could not point to where the competence of the federal courts begins and the limitations of the state tribunals ends.”

                Acerbic is a compliment! 😉
There is no self-loathing here.  I may not like Jackson among all the American men of the past, but I like that you defend the Southern White Male culture. That’s all.  I should not comment before 2nd cup of coffee!

                    I understand. I was not clear. I think the Left vilifies Jackson out of self-loathing. I’m a Jackson fan only to the extent that he is an American original. He would not be on my list of great presidents, but like Nixon, I probably find him more interesting than most of the great presidents.
