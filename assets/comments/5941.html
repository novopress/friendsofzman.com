        Here is what George Washington said about political parties;“However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.”GEORGE WASHINGTON, Farewell Address, Sep. 17, 1796And regarding the remark of Zman re: political parties;“Both parties have often pulled their punches for the sake “bipartisan” cooperation.”Well, this has not happened at all since Obama has been president. The republicans whether in the minority OR MAJORITY , simple bend over for Ocommie and the democrats and take it right up their ass and THEN they ask Obama and the democrats, “please do it again.”

        “Eric Cantor lost his House seat and landed in a $3.4 million per year gig at a bank. Losing is not so bad in modern politics.”
This is the problem.
