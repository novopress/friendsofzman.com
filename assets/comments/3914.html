        minor point, last sentence about .308 being used in AR-15’s is a little silly.  .308 would be used in an AR-10 perhaps, not an AR-15.

        Well, Dan Kurt, maybe you can invent your own principle based on the 4%. You could call it the Liberty Principle.

        re: ” It will only take 20% of the population (Pareto Principle) to change things. Are we there yet?” Kathleen4% is more like it not 20%. 50% are women and don’t count. Of the 50% left 40% are younger than 16 and older than 50 so that they don’t count. That leaves 30% of the original population in play. Half of that 30% are too dumb to count on or are on welfare or work for the government so that leaves 15% in play. About one third of that are Liberals, metrosexual, college programed peaceniks or other nuanced feminized drones so that leaves 10% of the original population in play. Of that group 2% will lead and another 2% will follow them. That leaves a disorganized 6% to oppose the revolution. The 4% who believe in Liberty will win the field should they seize the opportunity.Dan Kurt

        Every day it seems, there is a fresh abuse of governmental power. How much more can we take? I’m guessing a great deal more. So many people are outraged, yet everyone seems paralyzed by that outrage, knowing that the usual means of redress are ignored by the politicians. What is the solution? We can build the gallows, and there would be quite a row of them, but who is going to collect the gallows “participants”? In case anyone has been sleeping, we live in a quasi-police state. I’m not sure what will push the country over the edge so that people are willing to risk their freedom/livelihood/lives, etc. to change the status quo. It will only take 20% of the population (Pareto Principle) to change things. Are we there yet?

        Not a defense of the Repubs, but this crap is coming out of the alphabet agencies so fast, the system wasn’t set up to deal with it.
