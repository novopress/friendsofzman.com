        There’s one particular public act of piety and virtue signaling that’s the strangest of all, and that involves White people and hating themselves as a race.

            Indeed. And strangely enough, most race traitors aren’t even aware of their treason. For instance, I write for a college sports website whose subscribers are almost all Grillers. They’re just ordinary white men aged 30 to 75. One thing I’ve noticed about them is that when they single out a player from an opposing basketball team for online abuse, it is almost always one of the few white guys on that team. There are plenty of nuggras whose appearance and behavior are far more obnoxious than the white guy’s, but the Grillers nevertheless home in on whitey.If I called the subscribers out on their behavior, aside from losing my job, I’m sure I would see them deny their treason perfervidly. Indeed, I’m sure it never even occurs to them that they even hate white players, let alone that it is a manifestation of an underlying hatred of their own race. These fools have so internalized the demonization of the white race that it is as much a part of their core being as their Christianity and their patriotism.

                As a longtime follower of college basketball (not as much recently, because…you know…) I can’t agree with you more about the weird hatred of white players coming from grillers.  On message boards when they talk about a player having a “punchable face,” every single time it’s a white player.

                    Yep. The “punchable face” of the white guy is the primary trope of this anti-white sports phenomenon.

                    There could be several things at play.  I think subconscious jealousy has something to do with it–these grillers are, at some level, jealous of the white athletes they say they hate, while they aren’t jealous of black athletes, no matter how rich or lauded they are, because they’re black.
It could also speak to some ingrained assumption that they might get away with punching a white guy, while the mere thought of punching a black guy inspires fear, either from the guy himself, the law, or society at large.

                        Well, there is quite possibly a fear of being called a racist for daring to even look crosseyed at any nuggra.

                            You are belittling them unjustly. The majority who were “forced” to take the jab did so not because they were afraid of being called “anti-science”, but rather that their jobs were the only way of putting food on the table.
It’s easy for us old farts to deride those who thought they had few options, when in truth, many of them did not. But it’s wrong to end the story there. It should be the goal to make sure the next generation doesn’t have to choose between providing for their families or standing for “principle”.

                    But it’s always the white Duke players who receive the abuse going back to Christian Laettner, and then JJ Redick, Jon Scheyer, Grayson Allen, etc.  The black Duke players get a pass like Grant Hill, Jabari Parker, Zion Williamson etc.  It’s more that Duke tends to have more white players than most other programs.  Iowa is the same way.  Big 10 white boomer fans hate those Iowa white guys.

                Yes. These whites are like all people status seekers. We on this site are unusual. For some reason, we put higher principles above status. We must at some level understand that this evil system’s status is not a real status. It is a denigration. For whites, power makes very clear what is the lowest and most repulsive and undesirable thing in the society. It is white men.Thus, it follows that for a white man to signal his desire to maintain his status and his standing in the system, his only option is to defame white men. This way he can be seen as being on the side of power.This is why we will always be nothing more than small band of dissidents. Once we get power, these people will immediately switch sides once they understand where power flows. Moreover, for White men, this will be a massive release of energy since in their being they will for the first time feel virile instead of servile. This is why The Regime must not let its boot off of the neck of our race.This is why we have to obtain power. We must move from the forums to positions of authority. These sniveling cowards you speak of will be the first to jump sides. Keep that in mind as a white pill and bend your mind and your will on finding a path to some position of power in your life. Not president unless that is realistic. But, the boss, the civic committee chairman, the local party chairman, the rifle club president … …Find and fill those positions and try and get some followers. Of course, grillers don’t know those positions exist. It doesn’t matter. It is the youth that matter now.

I don’t think it’s all that dark out there. We can’t afford the deadweight, so they will be cut loose. Stein’s Law: “If something cannot go on forever, it will end.”
I’m not so much sure that it’s authority you need, but control. Not control over others — followers will submit anyway. Start small with power over yourself, then your household, and keep expanding so far as you are able. You are right. If we own the company, we don’t have to worry about being outsourced or offshored.

            I brought this up yesterday I think it was re: white people being utterly submerged in negrophilia. Was at youth baseball tournaments all weekend and have noticed how common miscegenation has become among white suburban women. But it’s also everywhere, this complete lack of cultural awareness. Again, at baseball games, I notice every kid’s walk up song is some ghetto rap, it’s just as some wise man called it, “the dismal tide.” I wanted to slap the white men coaches because for heaven’s sake, have a little self-respect and respect for your people. But like Ostei says below, these people have so internalized this blackity black worship that to even broach the topic would be to get you hurled into the void.

        What can you say about the cuckery of Canadians? So the Liberal Party that has swamped the country with endless Indian immigration and raised taxes on everything got reelected because it was a “nationalistic” reaction to Trump’s ridiculous notion that we’ll annex the Great White North.What an insane narrative from the legacy media, but what a stupid move by the Canucks.Net zero is insanity. With everything “environmental,” it’s always a way to impoverish the middle classes and limit what our betters consider luxury items such as reliable electricity, meat, V-8 or V-6 powered cars and trucks to the ruling class only.Just look at EVs. If it was about “saving the planet,” we wouldn’t have a Hummer EV that weighs 9,000 pounds (the heaviest vehicle sold in the U.S.) and costs a mint. That could be said for all of these idiotic electric vehicles.All in the name of “saving the planet.” Spain and France are having blackouts because of this “renewable” energy grift. Sorry folks, the sun isn’t shining 24/7 (even with explosion-prone lithium-ion battery “storage”) and the wind isn’t always blowing, unless you’re in west Texas. You need reliable, baseload power provided by natural gas, coal or nuclear.The rest of us will eat our soy-based gruel, pay exorbitant taxes on everything, ride bikes or unreliable, crime-ridden “public” transportation, endure being packed on top of foreigners in “five-minute” cities and rent everything from the company store. And on top of that, we’ll have a surveillance state that will make sure to record our social credit score.You can’t hate these people and their smugness enough. They’re cancer and must be removed from power or else we really will have a civilizational collapse.

            If you cannot make renewable energy work in Iberia, where it’s both sunny and windy, it’s not going to work anywhere outside the tropics. Old, disused windmills dot the Portuguese countryside. They’re a quaint reminder of the benefits of internal combustion.

            There was an excellent piece at ZeroHedge yesterday (I know) about what happened in Spain, and I was surprised to see quite a few comments from Spanish and Portuguese at a few comment threads I skimmed on YT videos.  Essentially, what happened in Spain was quite similar to what happend in Texas – renewable sources of power malfunctioned (in Spain supposedly due to resonance) and they didn’t have sufficient sources to restart the grid from the ‘black.’  All coal/oil/nuclear sources have been shut down.  Three of the five hydro power stations were down for maintenance simultaneously.And this is not an isolated case.  Solar can be great for an outdoor emergency lantern or electric livestock fence, or an off-grid homestead.  Industry or society-wide – not so much.The Iberian YT commenters almost universally noted that since everyone uses digital means of payment, no one had cash on hand.  And almost everyone has electric stoves so only a few had butane camping stoves to cook on.  Just like every run-of-the-mill prepper novel.  They all said they planned to buy short-waveradios because there was no way to get information with the phones down.Important part is halfway down, from a DeepChat translated from Spanish:https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/power-restored-spain-portugal-net-zero-becomes-headache-brussels

            The mask regime during Covid was possibly the most invidious perversion of common sense that I’ve experienced in my 54 years.  In the spring of 2020, they gave all 500 of us at my place of work a t-shirt inscribed “I wear my mask to protect you, please wear yours to protect me!” I immediately draped mine onto the garbage can nearest our HR Karens.  To this day I still loudly mutter “faggot” to myself when I see someone donning a face diaper.

                        There was an early requirement here in Az from Walmart requiring mask wearing.  The problem was there was no description of the mask to be used (assumed I guess).  This actually was common among early adopters of mandatory mask wearing.  The response was a number of “malcontents” who wore goalie masks or paint ball masks into the stores.  (For those not familiar, these masks are really little more than large holed grills to keep hokey pucks or paint balls from breaking your teeth.).   😉

                            Here in Southern Utah, ze masks were everywhere. Figured this was bullshite. The worse mask Nazis was Costco in St. George with Kroger in Cedar City right behind. Within a few months I learned to put on a cheap very thin face gaiter, easy to breathe through and holes damn near big enough to allow a rampaging badger to rip through. Don’t ever mess with badgers.I’d hook my gaiter onto my chin and 3 times in a few minutes had Costco Nazis descend on me waving and roaring to pull my mask up. I did, then pulled it down 10 feet later. We played cat and mouse for half hour until they got serious and I got bored with the game. Agitated Asshole Karens! But it was fun! Enjoyed their rage and red faces. Bad Range.

                                    What a time to work at a bank, as my wife did. They quickly made all ordinary transactions drive-through only; otherwise you needed an appointment. But at the start of the psychosis, and in its dying last weeks, you could (indeed were required to) enter the bank masked. The irony of it was just too much. Bank tellers are trained to look at the faces of anyone who walks in, to learn names of regular customers quickly, and in general to have situational awareness.
After all these years, the colossal stupidity of it all still beggars the imagination.

                                        It was a truly awesome time! I usually only use ATMs, but I availed myself of every opportunity to open carry into a bank while wearing a mask. They even provided them at the door (masks, not guns, I mean), or I probably wouldn’t have bothered. Would have raised an eyebrow somewhere other than my small town, though…

Mask mania has been a real boon for the criminal element wanting to elude the surveillance state.

                    I played handball with a bunch of guys outdoors, leader of the group said, “bs” when no one would play OUTDOORS. Sent a note to group, one guy went berserk, “global pandemic” and all.We occasionally, on a sunny day, would have some nut slow down and scream at us… men, by the way. We would wave the one fingered salute, get the fuck out of here.Another buddy played outdoors in (Big City). Cops padlocked courts. Guys cut the lock. Cops come by, ‘get outta here’ … re-padlock. Process repeated, cops finally leave them alone.Too bad most’men’ pussied out. The women? Forget about it.

                    If only.  I’m still inundated by “Masks Encouraged” signs flashing on all public transportation, fresh “we’re all in this together” posters plastered all over town, and tons of masked up people driving alone with the windows rolled up.  That’s why I’m surprised at how many in my building actually stopped wearing them when given the choice.

                Sadistic herd animal is it exactly.  They must be brutally checked or they’ll strip every shred of freedom from you and call it ‘helping’.This potential always lurks in certain segments of society, like ticks on grass blades, waiting opportunity to latch on to the latest hysteria so as to unleash their Inner Commandante.The Scamdemic brought them so much authoritarian joy they actually danced in the corridors of the hospitals.  I felt equal parts rage and disgust.The Christian Society largely was un-herded, having the firm extended-family structure that Government hates.  When mass com took over, the herding of large demographic portions was fait accompli.

                The COVID tyranny offered a huge opportunity for awakening. It exposed the elite’s mechanisms of control and conformity, teaching us lessons we are obligated to act on and share with others. It was a GIFT.
Similarly, I often tell my Russian wife that the Ukraine conflict has been a gift for Russia. It woke Russians up to the  globalist agenda aiming to erode their national identity, uniting Russians against a shared enemy and strengthening their resolve to protect their sovereignty and culture.  They actually stand a chance now to preserve their people and Orthodoxy.

                    The war has pushed the Russians I know, who are more leftist than average,into the arms of Putin, so to speak.
What that means is they’ve taken on his attitude that the real enemy isn’t the West that attacks Russia but the Westerners who oppose globohomo: us “nazis” in America, and the European “far right.”
These people I know were normal smug atheist commies ten years ago. Putin has Americanized them, given them religion—his American religion: antifascism, anti-“white nationalism,” anti-whiteness.
While rootin’, don’t forget that he would have every one of us imprisoned for blasphemy (racism).

                            This is correct. OP please get fact straight before posting.
Too many Americans don’t make effort to grok Russian attitudes toward the Soviets.
The point is that the airport is named for the Siege of and victory at Stalingrad, not Stalin as a man.
Similarly the Victory Banner they march with on May 9 is there because it’s the banner under which they defeated an enemy which would have enslaved and eventually erased them as a people.

My favorite “pet peeve”.  No benefit in this world is devoid of cost.  Life is little more than a continuous cost/benefit analysis.  The people saying this are on the “left side of the curve”.  Analysis—intellectual contemplation—is beyond them.

                Why peanuts are banned in so many places.  Hey, my own grandson supposedly has a peanut allergy (I’m not convinced; his mother had him tested when very young).  Hey – your health and allergies are your problem, not society’s.  Only the insane organize all institutions based on the outliers – and all of the ‘West’ is insane.

                    I used to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch in elementary school all the time in the 1970s and in middle school and high school in the 80s.  Peanut allergies were nearly unheard of. Bringing any kind of peanut butter to school was perfectly normal.  My high school had peanut products in vending machines.  Now it is almost entirely banned.
WHY are peanut allergies so common in children now?  Or is it really? Is it lack of exposure?

Because the j00z have existentially sh!tty immune systems [owing to 5000 years of inbreeding] and are deathly afraid of peanuts.
Peanuts are to j00z as Garlic is to Vampires.
And are suhciety is now awash in j00z &amp; various mischling products of miscegenation.

                    “Only the insane organize all institutions based on the outliers – and all of the ‘West’ is insane.”Following right behind these institutions are people who demand others bend to their “needs”.  As I once mentioned, we had a child in a school that sent home a letter requesting that all lunches brought by their children be examined for foods containing “peanut” additives or cooked in such oils and that these no longer be provided!The rationale was that a new student had enrolled that had such an allergy and that the mere *breath* of another student who had imbibed the “forbidden” food could set off a deadly reaction.At least the parents at the school were not as insane as the school’s admin.  We protested and finally the child in question was given a private table to sit and eat lunch, which no other student could use and was washed down everyday before lunch.  Life went on as before for the rest of us.

Talk about Cluster-B.
Sheesh.
Every time you back down like that, Cluster-B becomes more &amp; more powerful.
You can’t defeat Cluster-B by receding back into the roll of Mr Nice Guy Who Always Finishes Last.
Cluster-B simply rolls its eyes and laughs at you.
Simp.
Simp-Ly.
That’s a strange linguistic homophone.

                    Of course you are entirely correct when you say they will behave the same in the next crisis.But I was speaking more of the masks.  Absolutely nobody was using N91 masks.  Every person I ever saw in public wearing a mask was wearing a paper or fabric mask.  This is like trying to keep bees off of your property with a chain link fence.  No virus of any kind will be stopped with such a mask. It’s like it’s not even there.  Everywhere was sold out of N95 masks by the time covid went mainstream.  Even the paper masks were hard to get in the early days.  But it was about as effective as antisocial distancing.  Some black guy got mad at me in Acme because my toes were past the footprints on the floor (remember those)! 5’11” is death. 6′ is safe.

                Tars Tarkas:“Being forced to utter obvious lies brings them great joy.“
Both Jesus Christ and George Orwell were highly cognizant of that phenomenon.
The Power of Lies.
The thrill of forcing a man to accept the Lie, to kowtow before the Lie, to prostate himself before the Lie, to be infatuated with the Lie, to believe the Lie, to worship the Lie, to become the Lie.

            Believe it or not New York just found a sacred cause of moral purity that superseded the mask piety. They just banned wearing masks if you’re committing the crime of offending the Jews.
I shit you not.
They actually passed an anti-mask law because of all the pro-Gaza students at NYU and Columbia wrapping keffiyahs around their faces while protesting the Jewish war crimes in Gaza:

            During the Covid regime I carried around a ski mask. Whenever someone told me I had to wear a mask, I took out the ski mask and pulled it over my head so that only my eyes were showing. The irony was always hilarious. My bank required a mask, so I always went in with the ski mask on and carrying a backpack. In normal times they would have suspected a robber, but during the Covid regime the robber look was the new normal.My favorite experience was the day I went in to a men’s barber shop that happened to be run mostly by women. As soon as I went in they demanded that I put on a mask, so on went the ski mask. When my turn to sit in the chair came up, the woman barber told me I had to wear one of their masks. I said I have a mask on. Obviously she couldn’t cut my hair with a ski mask on so she got outraged. I kept repeating that I have a mask on and I preferred my mask. Eventually, she told me to get out and threatened to call the police. Exposing her absurdity was a deliciously satisfying experience.

                    Sort of. My in-laws realize that when CNN says “anonymous sources” , they mean, “random bullshit” but not when Fox News cites their “anonymous sources”.
Now to be fair, Fox doesn’t do that nearly as often. Their sources generally want name recognition, even if it’s only after the fact.

Unless you’re a truly self-dealing rat bastard like Mark Carnage in Canada.  He’s getting rich on foreign energy contracts, so he’s suppressing Canadian energy production to boost his offshore contracts.
I notice that about all the oligarchs; whether manufacturing, energy, food, or pharma, selling out whatever country they’re operating in is to benefit their profits made somewhere else.

        “the boutique beliefs of our self-declared priests are pointless. The sanctification of George Floyd appealed to our betters because of its absurdity”The absurdity is a great loyalty test because it is guaranteed to get a WTF? from normal people.However, boutique beliefs aren’t pointless. They have been shown to be very effective at:1. Making money for the wealthy and other powerful people. Climate change has particularly been a bonanza for climate researchers and both the tech elites and Wall Street2. Amassing more power for the already powerful. Every moral panic features a solution to take away more freedom from the mob and give more power to our betters3. Fulfilling the emotional needs of women. The boutique beliefs provide women with the drama they desire, the ability to be boss girls and tell normal people what to do, and a way to show they are good without having to treat people well or be honest.Win!

        There’s a cycle to this. In prehistory, we had the simple Right of Conquest. As we evolved, religion and agriculture progressed, so we got the Divine Right of Kings. Complexity grew, so we evolved rights and consent – Magna Carta etc. Of course, Ghengis Khan et al. still stuck to the old-fashioned Right of Conquest. I would argue that today’s Ruling Elites just recycled Ghengis’ philosophy. They ride private jets, yachts instead of horses, scattering their enemies. We bleat about Jesus or “muh rights”; they don’t GAF and trample whomever impedes them. The veneer of Gaia worship or “the open society” is far less credible to me than the Lady of the Lake and Excalibur. That’s the point – it adds to the humiliation. I could grudgingly respect a King or a Khan.

            Absolutely. At a certain level the power flex is at least as strong of a motivation as deranged religiosity. As hackneyed a phrase at it is, power truly is the ultimate aphrodisiac, and sociopathy is its highest form. Once upon a time First Night permitted the lords to rape the female peasantry, but like so much else that has been outsourced to Third World monsters, and the current vicarious nature probably intensifies the sexual release. Starving and freezing people is of a piece.
Evil is quite real.

            Yes. It is interesting. They also have a self affirming wing of their religion. It is the ingenious Canon of Self-Help and the Law of Manifesting. They take a truism, that your outlook and belief can shape your life, and turn it into a clever two-way power play. They have made it by selling garden variety truisms with a lot of charisma and a dispossessed people desperate to believe they have control. You see they became rich because their minds are special and powerful and manifested this abundance. For the next 10 seminars at only $12000 you too can unlock the secrets and get the coaching you need to attain success.At once, they are your psychological better. Simultaneously you can pay to unlock the secrets but if you still aren’t getting what you want, you can try harder the path of impotence which is paying for help and chasing the psychological disposition which is the skeleton key of success.Justify your position.Offer those who might be way better than you a cope and a distraction at a price.Tony Robbins and his entourage make vast sums peddling this stuff. His wife is insane and her guru is some Indian guy who smirked and got a sinister gleam in his eye back in ’20 when he said, ‘Yes. There are too many people. We need far fewer people.’You see they have what they have because they thought it into existence. You don’t have it because you just have believed hard enough.

        A good essay but I don’t think the Covidiocy fits in with the priestly schema. The Covid craze was not about a social sect isolating itself from society by ritualistic performativity. On the contrary, it was a classic case of mass hysteria that was capitalized upon by the secular priests. The masses–a good 80 percent of them, anyway–went stark raving bonkers and then the clerics fashioned rituals–triple masks, social distancing, bathing in sanitizer, etc.–to channel the hysteria into a mainstream religion whose object of veneration was the state and its medical apparatus. In consequence, the state became more powerful, although it also ultimately burned up much of its credibility in the process.

            Right, but I think the High Priests certainly amplified and encouraged the hysteria, even if they didn’t foment it, which they may have anyway. We still don’t know exactly what happened and the precise sequence of events. I think your analysis fits better with the St George F. events than with Covid. That said, I agree completely that the objective of all these episodes is furthering the deification of the State.

            Very succinct summary of the Vid. In the early months of 2020 I told friends and family the same thing- this has all the hall marks of mass hysteria. Of course I wasn’t taken seriously, but I knew it didn’t add up when the park down the street had the playground yellow taped off because this new dEaDly virus could live on surfaces outdoors, for daaaaaays. I knew then it was fake and gay so while walking the dog at night I tore down the tape, a crime against the state that probably would have earned jail time. The tape was replaced within a day anyhow.

We don’t need to go full bore sacrilegious here; we can simply honor the insights of Saint Vilfredo Pareto, and confess that 80% of the population needs to be led around be their nose rings…

Unfortunately, that also means that we 20%-ers are responsible for protecting the well-being of the 80%.

It’s the duty of the 20% to pull the 80% away from the edge of the cliff, and back into the safety of the meadow.
The 20% must be the shepherds of the 80%, else the 80% will perish.

                        Blaming human stupidity on God is almost as dumb as blaming it on advanced civilization.God provided living creatures with evolutionary mechanisms to avoid everything going extinct the moment He gave humanity dominion over the earth which would allow us to drastically change environments.To speak to our current situation, America has gone to great lengths to make her population stupid, complacent and compliant. The public education system goes without saying, but Hollywood culture, offshoring industry, and the social costs of mass migration are significant factors too.Then there is direct poison by often malicious actors. Scientists believed America’s IQ would recover after it dropped by multiple points from leaded gasoline, but that trend ceased. Most likely due to introduction of other neurotoxin vectors. Leaded gasoline was joined by lead paint which routinely finds its way into cheap, Chinese toys. Fluoride is a neurotoxin, and the levels they add into the water supply are not healthy according to at least one study on child IQ development. Mercury in fluorescent bulbs and vaccine stabilizers. Metabolic syndrome from a carb-based diet is becoming hard linked to cognitive decline due to the brain becoming insulin resistant. I am sure there are others I am not well aware of.IQ Shredders, as in cities that convince smart people not to breed, are devoted to greed, hedonism and narcissism over family. Women seeking power careers in law firms is the same dynamic. Those gods will not give you many children, smart or otherwise.If the American ruling class was not so bent on a stupid, complacent population, so feckless to keep poisoning us, and so greedy to prevent family formation in the rising middle class, then we might have had one of the highest IQs in the world. Smart children use to play with Legos and electric circuits. These days, they put together and program robots. Nevermind the general financial complexities of modern society. The conditions were almost there for a very intelligent and enterprising population.The limits of evolution are a different discussion, but the generational speed of it merely requires that you educate yourself on the latest inSovietscience, comrade.

                    The entire event was one of the most evil things to have ever occurred, and I am not being hyperbolic. From a purely anthropological stand point, it is fascinating and should be studied in great detail. But it won’t be because that would cause some inconvenient truths to surface, and we can’t have the proles getting restless. I was actually surprised for awhile that someone who’s life and family was destroyed hasn’t put Fauci on a lamp post, but then I see things like that Metcalf kid’s dad genuflecting before his son’s murderer and then I realize yeah, we’re all out of steam as a people.

                        What’s amazing is that, apart from the occasional hand-wringing article about “long covid”, the whole thing has disappeared down the memory hole. Is this because people realise they were conned and feel too embarrassed to talk about it, or because they still believe the official narrative and see it as a battle that they fought and won and that is now a part of history?

Goodness only knows what transpires in the minds of the Normies.
I certainly can’t decode the Normie mindset [unless maybe I were to immerse myself in 24×7 Talmudvision psy-ops for several decades].

            “The masses–a good 80 percent of them, anyway–went stark raving bonkers”
Was it, though? Where I live, it was top-down fanaticism. The local churches through pastor or sometimes council decreed that the church was closed, or assigned seating, every other pew. (Catholics blindly obeyed the Pope.) Most ignored it until the county commissioners (all 3) decided that we must mask, and even then, most ignored them. Except big boxes and schools (including colleges), where it initially was enforced with mailed fist, but before long, sheep begged to be allowed to don the Codpiece of St. Fauci.

The rules werefor you—a gift.Mask and vaccine mandates, SWAT-gear cops putting their rifle sights on girls sleeping on beaches, etc., were exemplaryright-populism. Proof: Tucker Carlson wrote a letter to Trump, worried about the virus.You like Tucker, right?Media man of the people?

            It was certainly mass hysteria and the “madness of crowds” but I believe it was also a desperate attempt to fill the vacuum at the heart of modern people. Many seemed to feel it was the Great Cause they’d been missing for so long. “Climate change” didn’t fit the bill because even the sheep don’t want to tighten their belts and pretend to like Greta von Thunberg. No, Covid was very much a “We’re all this together!” kind of moment. I even heard people in England talking about the return of the Blitz spirit.

                That explanation has also been used to explain why the Boomers supported the so-called “civil rights movement” so fanatically. Ostensibly, they were jealous that their parents had a great cause–mashing Mustache Man and his minions–and so latched onto deifying negroes and condemning their own people as theirs. There’s probably something to it.

If only we could refashion the passion into extolling the rise of the White Man.
As Creation’s design made us to be, I add.This fire-in-the-belly is what motivates the Semites: both halves see themselves as bringing their God to the world. (Jews and Muslims.)
That is, to manifest in the world as the dominance of their peoples.
Wait, what?  Isn’t He already here?  Then we Whites must be the Nephilim, the Fallen, the angels who brought death to mankind.

        is this a boomer thing, or can anybody play?  🙂  has new age nonsense spread past gen-x into the younger cohorts?
my sense is that there is a fear of aging and death driving a lot of these managerial types, and that somehow they can live longer if they make other people live shorter.

                One gal, a mega hottie taken as a trophy wife by a California Democrat politician, revealed that after the first year, there was no more physical sex, not even the mild domination roleplay she craved.

            Definitely mass fear of aging and death.  There’s an obnoxious lib who makes YT videos on the ‘best 10/50 ‘x’ towns/cities/states.’  He had one recently forretirees and every last comment asked about availability and convenience of ‘health care.’ Old farts arrange their entire lives about the closest doctor and hospital.  I haven’t seen a doctor in about eight years.  We bought emergency helicopter service when we moved to the middle of the woods, because of the long drive to the nearest hospital if there was an accident/crisis, but that’s about it.

            “new age nonsense spread past gen-x into the younger cohorts?“
Just look around colleges and high school hangouts. Just a decade ago, people that age were bulletproof. Immortal. Now every third one has a silly mask on, even though it’s no longer “required”, and, worse, his friends don’t mock him mercilessly.
Seriously damaged goods.

It’s only going to get worse, as we move towards 2030 and 2035 and 2040; the V@xxies will start dropping dead like flies; miscarriage &amp; stillbirth will become the new normal; yuge numbers of ancient ancestries will come to a screeching halt.
We’re gonna run out of cemeteries in which to bury the V@xxies.
Most all of them will have to be cremated.

        Everyone is familiar with the smirking western politician. All our lives, we have heard the expression, “bet you can’t say that with a straight face.” And you wonder why they are constantly smirking. It is frequently mistaken for smugness. It is a tell of the state of western decline that our professional liars are not even very good liars. Although I will give credit to this Canadian Carney for doing it more convincingly. I’ll bet $10,000 he has received instruction from an acting coach. Everything about him is manufactured.Another tell of the fake lying scum, besides the smirk, is the compressed lip grimace. You know the one I mean. I have probably never made this facial expression in my life. I bet you haven’t either, or not very often. But it’s a regular specialty of the lizard people. See it from them all the time. Whenever you see a public figure make that face, you know. The one person I used to know (now deceased) who regularly made that face was a pathological liar.

            Yes. The desire to find a sinner to torment is why the common copes of the right (move out of cities, abandon universities and corporations, home school) won’t actually work in the long run. There is no way our betters will allow us to go unpunished and to slip out of their control

            Blocking out the sun has been ongoing in America for decades, through the use of chemtrails.  In the mountains of the PNW I’d see these operations almost daily in summer.
It’s partly a loco-eco move to Save Mama Gaia, and partly a psyop because the sight of crystalline blue sky blotted-out by filmy crud is depressing.

                Millions and millions of tons of toxic particulates sprayed into the air, with daily multiple reports and photos from dozens of states and countries.  It just can’t be ignored any longer, but the sheer scale of these operations is astounding.
What madness is it to spread a layer of poisons and heavy metals on everything- ground, water, crops, wind.  The aluminium alone does so much long term brain damage in the old and young.  I get wanting the masses dead, but at the cost of everything else?

        “… people like himself who show themselves as our superior by believing in boutique ideas like climate change …”I have forgotten more about climate than these cretinous subcognitives could learn if they lived to be 10,000 years old. I know that few reading Zman need the reminder, but for anyone who does:we are not in a climate crisis. There have been such events before, such as the multi-centurial megadrought which played a crucial role in the late Bronze Age collapse.While it is prudence to explore the possibility (it has happened before and WILL happen again, eventually), there is zero evidence that such an event is pending. Moreover, consider that when that civilization-shattering megadrought event happened, it was LONG before the industrial revolution. It is a manifestation of leftist desire to be God that they think that everything we do has profound impact on the reality that obtains, and that everything is our fault and hence a sin that we must atone for by obeying the newsbimbo on the Talmudvision.The climate ‘crisis’ is a manufactured event with objective to stampede the white human cattle towards their own destruction, and monetize the process for maximum profit. The people behind this are Satan’s own children on this Earth, and need to be removed from it.

And even if we were in the worst crisis of the IPCC models, all you would have to do die of old age in the climate of your birth is move about 60 miles further from the equator.

        The Bishop of WEF EcoZone 3 didn’t give a speech. He gave a masterclass in psychological control. He is just another crazed cult leader, who tells you that you really want it, as he puts a hot iron on your neck while he violates you. This abuse is what you asked for he tells you as his heart’s desire is fulfilled by having you so whipped and powerless that he knowingly violates your body as confirmation that he has violated and completely deconstructed your mind.The Bishop of WEF EcoZon 3 does have a higher purpose. He and the other Bishops and Cardinals have been bent on it for decades. Embedding net zero into every financial transaction to save the planet is the pretext. The goal is merely to embed themselves into every financial transaction, taking a cut.We knew this about this guy by virtue of where he has spent his life working. He is a financier and a financial engineer. He can’t make money investing and lending. But, he can deconstruct and violate your minds in order to render you a cow that he and his buddies can keep alive but slowly bleed, getting fatter and stronger on making us weak.Their hatred of us is obvious. They are sinister.

        It is why the modern priests are more lethal than those of the past. They inherited the Christian distain for this world and the joys within it. Then they bolted onto it a class consciousness based in contempt for the people over whom they rule. Add in the minority’s natural paranoia and the result is a ruling class that seems to be hellbent on pulling the roof down on Western society.Modern priests are sociopathic and get off on sadism. This has nothing to do with helping humanity and everything to do with hurting it. These types are not disdainful of the joys of this world at all. They just take great delight is depriving others of any joy. John Kerry flies a private jet not because he is a hypocrite,per se, but because he likes to rub salt into the wound of those queuing to be groped. Your child being raped and murdered by a Third World savage brings them almost as much joy and manipulating their drones into mouthing “diversity is our strength” if the aftermath of the crime. The crimes have to be turned up to 11 lest boredom sets in. Evil is quite real and is the coin of the realm now.

        Woke is a secular religion.  Feminism is a secular religion.  That they are secular doesn’t diminish the zeal of Adherents.
They are not Believers, because their (often very) public obeisances indicate that group pressure — Herd affirmation — drives the Adherent.  Not faith in God, nor in any god except that of expediency and self-serving moralism.
You are correct, what we witness are ritual acts smacking loudly of the ancient world.  Tech is upgraded, that’s all.  America, Britain, Canada, Australia, carefully managed consensus and consent societies.  We are the new Aztecs, but with more genders.

        Given Zman’s essay today and the remarks of his commentariat, the following quote is apropos:“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be ‘cured’ against one’s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”-C.S. Lewis

                Also always apropos:“Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small. In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better.When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.”―  Theodore Dalrymple

Probably a good start. I’d prefer to see the state, the entity which supposedly keeps them from harming us, but is instead their creator and enabler, get pulled down in tandem. The state is, by far, the bigger threat. Just think about the lobbying group that usually gets top billing on this comment section. Incorporated, maybe, but not a corporation in the sense most think of it. And, ultimately, tied to another nation-state.

They will.  The corporations would already be dead if not forcontinuousbailouts.  We are coming to the end game, the world has been bailing out .gov for quite some time.  TBTF describes goldman sachs and uncle sam.  They’ll hang together 😉

                    “The corporations would already be dead if not for continuous bailouts.”
I was going to leave this alone, but, no. My corporation would be plugging along just fine. It never got a penny of bailouts, and is largely only a corporation because to be filed as a sole proprietorship would have added almost 50% to their tax.
Recognizing the reality of taxation seems no different to me than recognizing the reality of gravity. Being a recipient of taxpayer bailouts, OTOH…

        A food taboos serves a useful function for a priestly caste. It stops their followers from enjoying feasts or festivals with members of other religions. I mean, you can’t go to a Philistine feast if they serve pork, can you?
The idea that it has anything much to do with health is probably just an inaccurate invention.  The people of Spain live in a climate very similar to Palestine’s: they guzzle pork with abandon. Indeed, they produce what is probably the best ham in the world.

        When I was younger I remember being annoyed, frustrated, and also amazed at the speed at which these signals disseminated in the media. I assumed that these people did it because it was their job to take these signals from the real players and say them. Obviously this is true on some level – talking points are a real thing – but as Z points out it isn’t the full explanation. These people believe in it. Look at how they started talking about our beloved American institutions (like the CIA and Congress LOL) at the same exact time. Witness the speed with which Elon went from beloved to their enemy, it happened about 3.4 seconds after he bought Twitter and dismantled the Yoel Roth censorship regime. Witness the speed with which they embraced free trade. Or just look at the Great Awokening, where they all became open border and transgender advocates about five seconds after opposing those things.I don’t think you can explain this is fully materialist or political terms. It is more like a mass hysteria or demonic possession fully engulfed this population circa 2012 or so.

That’s one way to describe such.  My way has been, “They hate themselves”!  This is why the concept of “Spiteful Mutants” postulated by Woodley resonates so loud with me.

                Maybe, idk. I grew up with a handful of these types, and that’s where I got the Revenge of the Nerds idea from. The men, that is. I find women to be almost universally self-loathing to greater or lesser degrees.

I’ve found from exp. that they’re full of anxiety and just can’t relax for the most part.  I’ve knew women in college who would got to the hospital because of panic attacks, dated one.  That was an eye opener.

        Religion evolved as the primary mechanism for preserving and passing along ancient wisdom borne of hard lessons learned in the local environment. And religious leaders were the guardians of this process of social education and propagation. They were selected based upon stubborn adherence to these ancient principles and given high status as their reward. In the age of the internet influencer, temporary ephemeral fads replace ancient wisdom. It is the death of resilience and robustness. Fragility is doom.

            I see an opening wherein I can make a plug for a book I recently discovered.Timothy Alberino, Christian, archeologist, world traveller has written a very interesting book explaining his interpretation of the Bible. Fascinating. Anyone else read Albernino’s “Birthright”?
He confirms Catherine Fitts’ (see Tucker Carlson’s interview) story about cataclysmic underground cities the deep state has built for their own personal security.

        I’ve often wondered why supposedly pious folks wear these outward symbols, I assume it’s to show other folks how special they are, but it’s hilarious to me, because God already knows what is in your heart, you ain’t foolin’ anyone. It’s also interesting to note that church and gang both have many practices and symbols required for inclusion. Both gangs and churches send out recruiters with quotas to fill, both require “initiations” involving swearing fealty, both require tithing or tribute, both select and groom the young, and both hotly defend their territory. (Atheist denies absolutely the existence of God, agnostic says well maybe, prove it”)

            Yeah, about that. A Pharisee, half jewish, declares himself “reformed” and becomes a central figure in the new church? The self-described most humble of the bunch? And he’s the primary source for the re-phrasing of Jesus’ words? Despite the originals, like James, who disagree?
No wonder He says so few will find the gate…

                I say Paul was a police spy, an infiltrator whose mission was to ferret out the Apostles for public execution. His sermons were written by his Roman clerks, Simon and Lucius (likely the same “Luke”).
The gig happened to be a good one, serving both the Praetorians and the Sanhedrin. He ended up in political battles with Peter, and with Jesus’ brother James and the Magdalene, Jesus’ common law wife, over leadership of the movement.
During the reign of the Four Emperors, Paul’s faction fell from favor, and he was publicly purged to further discredit his faction(s).

        “It is not that they hate you. They hate everyone, but they really hate you.”Yes, but so what? You’re a moral relativist. You don’t get to affirm that it’s wrong to hate you or anyone else.Setting that matter aside, I think its helpful to notice how ironic is the religion of the new clerisy. The people who hoot and holler most about separating Church and state are fanatically devoted to building up a virtually unlimited ecclesia in which their church and state are one.Why are they so despotic? A few centuries ago some rebellious fools preached a doctrine about “We the People” ordaining and establishing whatever system and laws they see fit. This alternate god, “We the People”, is one in being with its own flock, and it didn’t take long for it to come under management by a new clerisy of menand girbosses. Because equality. The irony of this monstrous affair emerging from Christian heretics and former Christians is on stilts.As it turns out, the new religion is a suicide pact, which is another irony. Jesus the wannabe high priest committed suicide and was never heard from again. Likewise it seems to be the plan that Caucasians, Slavs, and so on will disappear from the world after a brief time of pretending to be their own god. Funny that leading helpers of Jesus’ suicide were the Pharisees, who later morphed into the rabbinate, who are leading instigators of our destruction now.Have I mentioned that the clerisy is like a wannabe high priest who pretended to be part of his own god? As it turns out, the old religion from Israel forshadowed another strange development. The clerisy of “our democracy” complains that the People are abandoning it. Eli, eli, cry members of the clerisy, why are ye not voting correctly!

Like @Jeffrey Zoar, I have reserves that I keep topped up, though I have substantially more. The last jar of white rice rotated out of storage had been set aside in 2004, but I’m not reducing the set-aside, either. Lots of food I’ll never live to eat, but hopefully it gives my kin a buffer,.

            The golfer is waging a war, in his own way, on landfill economy without even realizing it. Let’s welcome it while it lasts, that is, until domestic production can provide cheap substitutes to be trucked off to the landfills after a brief period of usage. Meanwhile, no hoarding is necessary. Less imported junk in the home is better imported junk in the home.

            The ridiculous articles that came out yesterday about Amazon’s tariff listings tell the tale. They were discussing Amazon Haul which is designed to compete with Shein, AliExpress, Temu, etc. All these are companies that are built around making cheap crap of the lowest quality possible and then shipping it to us on a massive tanker and then shipping it across our vast land on trucks and planes. This junk just ends up in a landfill or on the bottom of a closet after a couple weeks and then the buyer starts the process anew. We don’t need ANY of this, and the pattern ends up being compulsive and people get addicted to it. It’s just totally horrible for the environment as well, but I never hear a Democrat talking about it.

            The econ folks I’ve been reading say expect a supply shock like we had in Covid to arrive about 2-3 months.
It may last for years, similar to a Depression, especially as TPTB will respond in as hamfisted a way as the Great Depression types did.

            Topping off a few things – don’t need extra food but bought more plastics (detergent, dish soap, shampoo, deodorant, trash bags).  A local lady surprised me by mentioning she had made a run to Sam’s club (about 2 hours away) and stocked up on all those same things.  I support Trump on tariffs, but I also place zero trust in the average person’s common sense.  If shelves do actually get bare over the next 2-6 weeks, I expect people to panic buy even things made domestically, like toilet paper.

        It took about 3500 years to start understanding a prohibition Jews received on eating pork.Turns out that humans and pigs are surprisingly genetically similar, and pigs’ organs could be used for transplants.If a pig has genetic deviation, their meat could irrevocably change our body.

            Points to you, perhaps that’s why they’re “vaccinating” the pork with mRNA, not solely because the powers believe pork is an aversion, but also as a vehicle to affect the goyim- cull the weak, mutate the strong, to make them suitable for hosting. Pork in Chinese dishes, ham and bacon in Caucasian dishes…

        Purity apparently doesn’t apply to chicks. Each passing decade they get sluttier and raunchier. Now, *raised hands* I am not entirely against this trend. When bare breasts become the norm, it’ll improve the sight-lines of the city. What I question is what beta males get out of this. It’s all fine and dandy for the alpha males who get to freely sample the forbidden fruit, but what is the poor, sexually frustrated chump to do?

            The breasts that ate bared are unkikely to be the ones that will “improve the sightlines”.  Regardless, slutty women means no lasting marriages which means a hell society.  Controlling the women and their self destructive stupidity is among the most vital tasks of human society.

            This has got to be an AI generated spam.  Note that Greg’s commentary rarely adds to the discussion—or even makes sense within the current theme of discussion, but uses appropriately gleaned “buzz words”.  Second, no matter what the response to “his” comment, Greg (AI) never responds for further “back and forth” discussion, i.e., what we call argument.  Third, the comment submitted by Greg-AI is always made early in the morning as if set by a timer to hit after a typical posting by Z-man can be scanned.Z-man, any thinking upon my analysis here?  Are you curious as to who/what Greg-AI is?

                Agreed,@Compsci. I, too, have noticed that Greg’s comment usually has at least something to do with the topic. At least, as much as any of the other comments usually do. I’ve been wondering how many iterations separated it is. I doubt it’s just feed in Zman’s essay and out pops bare breasts.

                You beat me to it, Compsci, but this comment was too obvious.
I once thought that Greg had the mind of a college freshman: entirely derivative, not actually thinking, thoroughly normie knowledge base. The vexing aspect was that he never seemed to learn from the content here. In retrospect, I may need to apologize to college freshmen.
The wonder is that Greg-AI seems to be becoming worse over time.
What if the singularity is Ouroboros disintegrating into noise?

Or, and I’m just spitballing here, maybe create the circumstances such that they freely choose the right path? Like the meme with the woman in an apron, getting smooched by her man, a couple kids nearby, something like, “Imagine the propaganda it would take to make them think this is oppressive.”

                    “…create the circumstances such that they freely choose the right path?”  Strongly agree, it is the essence of free will, free to choose correctly.
We have to get the power to control the Narrative for that; I notice the Temperance shrews, who were far more vile and violent to other women than we were told, didn’t really get going until after the Emma Goldman types- whose primary cultural contribution is to radicalize any splinter group they can- arrived and began organizing the immigrants, the working classes, the politicians, the preachers, and the women.

I often agree with you, but this is just an excuse.
What moderns neglect is that managing the household was not some trivial matter. It was the difference between making it through the winter until there were dandelion and lamb’s quarters and plantain greens to gather come spring.
Maybe it’s hard to come up wit something to keep her busy and feel needed in an era of supermarkets, but you are up to it, yea?

                    I wish that were feasible, but I’ve seen that approach fail, in real life, enough times that I put no stock in it.  I’m sure some percentage of women can satisfy themselves with that scenario, but its far from a majority.  There’s just too much data showing that they, in aggregate, never stay happy with what they’ve got no matter how good.
