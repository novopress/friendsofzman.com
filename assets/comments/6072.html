        T’was the night before KwanzaaAnd all through the ‘hood,Maulana Karenga was up to no good.He’d tortured a woman and spent time in jail.He needed a new scam that just wouldn’t fail.(“So what if I stuck some chick’s toe in a vice?Nobody said revolution was nice!”)The Sixties were over. Now what would he do?Why, he went back to school — so that’s “Dr.” to you!He once ordered shootouts at UCLANow he teaches Black Studies just miles away.So to top it all off, the good Doctor’s new planWas to get rid of Christmas and piss off The Man.Karenga invented a fake holiday.He called the thing Kwanza. “Hey, what’s that you say?“You don’t get what’s ‘black’ about Maoist baloney?You say that my festival’s totally phony?“Who cares if corn isn’t an African crop?Who cares if our harvest’s a month or two off?Who cares if Swahili’s not our mother tongue?A lie for The Cause never hurt anyone!“Umoja! Ujima! Kujichagulia, too!Collectivist crap never sounded so cool!Those guilty white liberals — easy to fool.Your kids will now celebrate Kwanzaa in school!”And we heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight:“Happy Kwanzaa to all, except if you’re white!”

        Yeah, Kwanzaa is pretty much a crock. However this line —
” No culture on earth celebrates a harvesting ritual in December, …”
A culture south of the equator might actually have a harvest festival in that period. It would be the height of the summer then. Many cultures do not, eg NZ and AU, because they carry forward the traditions of their home country.

            To quote Mr. Z, just under the cartoon, “Here is the late great Tony Snow’s legendary column on Kwanzaa:” Internet sources indicate he wrote the column in 1999.

        The silly -aa at the end of “kwanzaa” pretty much suffices to show the vapidity of it all: In Kiswahili the term simply is kwanza (= beginning), as the article correctly has it in a quote. It’s an imagined African la-la-land which “Maulana” (an Arabic Islamic term meaning “our master”) Karenga and his ilk conjured up and mentally inhabited.

        Read somewhere that Karenga’s REAL motivation for “Kwanzaa” was to create an excuse for several more days of heavy partying after Christmas!
A much more logical explanation.

        I know of no blacks who are remotely concerned with Kwanzaa.   It seems even the sturdy left ignores it.  But the US Postal Service sells Kwanzaa  stamps!   I meant to ask the guy at the counter how many they’ve sold but it would probably get him into trouble.    Shows how easy it is to get the media to pick something up and how long it   persists in officialdom.

        Ur-Africa.
I’ve been trying to make this point for years, and am met mostly with dull stares.  I try to explain:   “You have no idea how big Africa is…….all these tribes evolved in relative isolation from one another over millennia…….and your Barack Obama has as much in common with you culturally…….and genetically even……..as Leonid Brezhnev has with me…….
The mountain of irrefutable evidence is met with………dull stares.
