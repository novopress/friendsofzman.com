        i can tell you that many young people today do not buy into the prog moral superiority bullshit.   and they do not like the coloreds one bit nor think they deserve any special treatment.   there is (i believe) a huge pool of antagonism to the blacks now, that wasn’t there before obama.

            All the iterations of what we’re calling the alt-right are strikingly young and male. It is not old white guys lamenting the passing of their time on the stage. The insistence by the orthodoxy that the rebellion is the old white working class has always struck me as a whistling past the graveyard. The election numbers make clear that it is much more widespread and much younger than the population as a whole.

                I agree, although… I know a LOT of young people, and the  social aspects of the Prog religion- diversity is our strength, gay is good, trannies in the bathroom , race doesn’t exist, is believed by a large number of young people, even those , like my boys, who have been raised as heretics.

                ” whistling past the graveyard”I like that phrase, and have been using it to describe WHY so many Republicans (maybe even the front-line Dems) stick with “Open Borders,” or at least can even bring themselves to say America deserves to have enforced borders. They just want to make it out of D.C. alive, and with enough of a golden-parachute to die-in=peace, behind their neighborhood’s strong, high walls.

                Married women with children are a key target demographic.  Minnesota of all places was almost in play because they saw Somalis in the shopping mall.
So in terms of young men, getting them to marry and have children is the top priority, whether or not that involves any ideological conversion.  But of course 110% of prog propaganda is about preventing that.

            It’s all relative.  My dad was in town a few weeks ago (Houston) and we went to a Walmart in the Galleria area.  The place was a multicultural dream/nightmare.  The striking thing was that the black people were the normal people.

            More than that. it also showed that Trump supporters didn’t care about all the progtard labels thrown at him. In fact they reveled in it, because it drove the progtards insane with rage..The Left(and political class) threw everything at him including the dreaded “Nazi” and “Hitler” bombs at him and it didn’t matter.People were and are fed up with the Left and their nightmarish bullshit.However the progs have now resorted to street violence to intimidate us. They know the authorities won’t stop them and the GOP won’t say squat because its a bunch of cucks and wall street meat puppets.  So it’s going to get very,. very bad for us in the public arena  from now on.If it gets sufficiently out of hand, it will destroy the ruling elite’s hold on the country for good. They stripped whites of a voice in literally everything while they eradicated towns, communities, family trees with toxic agendas. As a result there is a lot of pent up anger that is waiting for the right thing to set it off. And a bunch of goons coming at them with guns and knives will probably do it.

        A key way to not let them define the boundaries of debate is to respond to the charge of racism (the WMD of the progressive arsenal) not as mainstream conservatives do, by blathering about the democratic party plantation or how MLK was a conservative, etc., but to behave like the alt right types and give a big shrug capped by a Breibart “So?” Once you respond outside of the framework of options they’re familiar with, you’ve changed the framework.Liberals claim to believe in science, especially evolution, Well, since human beings have been racist/parochial/tribal/clannish throughout most of our species’ history, that means racism is one of two things: it is either advantageous in an evolutionary sense, or at least no kind of hindrance to the survival of an organism. Excessive love for the other-xenophilia- has no precedent in history, and as Steve Sailer always points out (much to the chagrin of the leftists) the “other” is either working as a maid or gardener in a progressive neighborhood, or is mostly absent.

            The appropriate response isn’t a Breitbart “So?”. It is punching the accuser in the face and telling them to go die in a fire. The moment you accuse me of racism is the moment you stop being people to me.

                The social context is everything, but I like to use the “Breitbart ‘so?&#x27;” in most situations I find myself in.  Gets the job done nicely without any assault charges being filed. It has a side benefit of completely scrambling their internal logic trees.

            Fish are not aware of the water.  That is the advantage vs. the Progs that we must exploit.  The Prog puppeteers are certainly aware, but the rest of them are oblivious to all of what Zman is talking about.  Heck, many of us mostly are, too, which is why these Zman posts are so valuable.  Having our intuitive hunches and vibes put into black and white clarity.  Back to the subject at hand–Hit ’em where they ain’t lookin’.

        “That’s why the medieval House of Saud still stands and why the Mullahs in Iran are still with us. They define right and wrong.”They may do that but that’s not why they’re still with us.They still exist because they hold the monopoly on violence to enforce their rule. It has nada to do with “moral authority”.Look at Europe and Briton and the muzlime invasions. Who thinks this would be taking place without the populace willingly disarming themselves due to years of Leftist brainwashing?If half of this shit was happening here there would be mosques burned to the ground and imams suddenly disappearing without a trace.(Side note: I see Karl has discovered the true heart of America. Hope he understands it’s because of our 2nd Amendment protecting our 1st and how that actually operates in the real world. Perhaps he would be so kind as to patronize some diners and bars in “Flyover Country” and converse with a few gun owners and allow them to enlighten him.)Never, ever give up your guns. Always buy more ammo.

        The key article of their Po-mo progressive faith — the Immaculate Conception and Resurrection rolled into one — is that he (xe?) who controls the narrative has the power to oppress and control.  Prove to them that isn’t true and they are just another flying saucer cult with the flying saucer two weeks overdue.There is a certain desperation in recent prog pronouncements.  Colbert’s rant and the Amanpour interview of She-Who-Must-be-Obeyed are standouts, but the whole “Trump is Putin’s shill” and “he’s gonna put all the illegals in concentration camps and gas them” narratives are other examples.  Colbert and Amanpour are appealing to their absent god to reveal ximself and to smite the unbelievers.  The old ceremonies and rituals are no longer working (i.e. the narrative is getting little traction outside the NPR-listening managerial class).  So the faithful must perform the ceremonies with the upmost devotion and zeal lest the god Narrative fail them.This is getting fun.  It’s like I’m living through a chapter inExtraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.You rock, Zman.  You are truly a catalyst.

        “Western Christianity may have run out of time and we need a replacement.”Secular-Humanism will never cut it as a Great Unifier. I re-read Francis Schaeffer’s heartfelt, “A Christian Manifesto,” and it actually fit in with how I’ve been seeing the philosophical-divide here and around the world. It even helped propel me to an Easter service after spending the last 6 years at a distance from all things Christian.https://www.amazon.com/Francis-A.-Schaeffer/e/B000APF76M/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1493835325&amp;sr=8-1While “Progressives” are certainly the overarching problem, Islam, IMO, will become the cutting-edge of that problem, sooner rather than later. (Not that mexican drug-gangs, and plain old Mexican and inner-city crime isn’t bad + growing.)I see waking-up Americans to the true political-nature of Islam to be of paramount importance. Educators like Bill Warner ofhttps://www.politicalislam.com/and Robert Spencer ofhttps://www.jihadwatch.org/are among the best resources.By looking at history, and the holding-back of Islam in the past, I sincerely see that ONLY something “greater than Self” (or posterity, IF we have any!) can “Hope” to unify us against the so-called religion of Islam.It is critical to choose RIGHT NOW:one stands with Islam and the domination of its “Sharia law” (or meekly not opposing it) or one stands with (or better yet, as) a Christian (with all Christianity’s flaws and in-fighting over the past 2000 years). As for me, I’ve chosen to stand as the sorriest of Christians.

        Not for nothing – but the “gun guys” have been addressing this morals problem for quite a long time.  Since the lefties have been trying to use the morals argument against the right to bear arms for like – forever.  There are at least some within the gun owner community that *finally* figured out what the game was.  Not a lot – but some.  There are still far too many “gun guys” who will reflexively start quoting facts and figures when attacked by lefties for their ownership of firearms.I fell into this trap for a long time – then it started to dawn on me that making emotion laden attacks and attacking the very morality of the lefties who argue that gun ownership should be restricted to government – is a far more effective technique.When I try to explain this tactic to people (on the right) – they usually simply just don’t get it.  They think they’re going to somehow “win” by quoting facts and figures.  It’s like talking to a brick wall. Quoting facts and figures just simply doesn’t work against lefties IMHO.  Moral and emotional attacks probably doesn’t “work” either  – at least as far as changing their minds.  But it sets them back on their feet – and it’s also somewhat satisfying to see a lefties spin out of control when you attack the center of their universe.

            Exactly. My stock response to any gun control talk is something like “Why do want to take guns from blacks? Don’t they have a right to self-defense?” It’s one way to flip the script and put Lefty on defense. I’m not interested in changing his mind. I’m just declaring the issue out of bounds.
There’s no reasoning with these people. the goal is to de-legitimizing them. Kill the man, kill his cause.

            The absolute first act of the French Revolution was not any political statement by anyone anywhere, but when commoners began searching about for ways to arm themselves.I don’t know if they still teach this to tourists at Williamsburg, but one of the lessons they used to teach was the taking of the town magazine by the people in, iirc, 1775. Having a hunting rifle wasn’t enough because after just a few shots with black powder a rifled barrel becomes so fouled it can’t be reloaded. Muskets are not rifled and are less accurate, but can be reloaded many times without having them so fouled with soot they become clogged and unfirable.We’ll know when it’s here when people you never thought would do so are asking how to get as many guns and as much ammo as they can get their hands on.

        This post about just about nails it. Unfortunately, the Alt-Right/dissident right thinks an onslaught of facts and figures will win hearts and minds in Middle America. That won’t cut it, although you would think it would since we have a mountain of statistical data on our side, so to speak.What we lack is the moral authority, or a deep seated belief in the moral righteousness of our cause.

            It’s not just that facts and figures can’t alter the geography of the fight. Even when progs are victims of minority violence, they obfuscate or flat-out lie (like the German girl who falsified the identity of the refugee who raped her, or the one moonbat who was raped in darkest Haiti and blamed it on the white man).

            The  Alt Right has s  a strong Christian component too it and a very strong rhetorical competent as well . Vox Day is especially good helping people understand rhetoric moves more than dialecticAlso go check out the Donald subreddit, its .Alt Light not .Alt Right but the amount of delegitimization of the Cathedral going on there is breathtaking.The problem is though that too much of the  .Alt Right is focused on Christianity and doesn’t have a clear answer for “what if it doesn’t come back .” This is especially the case in Europe where religion just ins’t nearly as much a thing as in the US.” Western Christianity may have run out of time and we need a replacement.What makes the lack of energy you are feeling is that the urge to rule isn’t there, A lot of the right is afraid to rule and that’s unwise, If it takes over its boots on necks all the way down and instead of running off to Monticello , odds are many people will be signing death warrants 12 hours a day or making policy and making people follow orders at gunpoint for decadesAt least the popular new You Can’t Run rhyme is going the right way, rule or be ruledAlso given how new the movement is, maybe ten years old max, its yet to have a foundational  ideology. What does the .Alt  Right want in concrete terms and how does it plan to do better than the establishment ?Its getting there though, the 16 points might work or just make America White again or whatever else comes up that makes the  heart beat faster, It can happen faster than you think as the sudden shift from passive to active streetfighting has shownI’d have assumed the the Right was  way behind the curve but nope. they are ready to rumble and to escalateIt makes  sense if you  remember the rule of revolutions, they require hope and guess what Trump gives?

                Christianity’s coming back is not not entirely or even mainly up to us.  Throughout history it’s been a movement of the Holy Spirit, particularly as seen in the three major revivals early in the history of the US that so shaped the founding.  But paradoxically these revivals also required the efforts of thousands of believers, new and old.So, it wouldn’t hurt anyone anywhere to pray for revival and to equip oneself for rhetorical combat with the Prog heretics that have taken over the mainline churches by studying The Word.  The Prog heresies have prevailed through the confusion wrought via their sustained attack on the authority of Holy Scripture and through their rhetoric of ‘niceness’: As in, ‘It’s not nice to make [_____, and particularly elite females] feel bad about their [sin they wish to embrace], thy just can’t help it’.Combatting this requires the assurance of knowing The Word and being willing to say to the Progs, “There’s nothing ‘nice’ about leading people spiritually astray.”  IOW, being ready, willing and able to say ‘So_?’ about the vertical dimension as well as the horizontal dimension.

                    This implies that said person is Christian or the society is  Ignoring .Prog heresy , you still can’t take that for granted,A lot of Europeans and increasing numbers of White and other actual Americans  are non religious or like myself very weakly religious  even in places where you’d expect religion to have sway.Places that are fairly traditional, conservative, nationalist and religious all at once aren’t doing much  better than Prog areas either. Hungary and Poland meet the criteria and they are about as well off as Germany though at least not diverse,This isn’t the doing of the other side, its a natural trend for choices made long before convergence and the 21st centuries abundant amount  of  informationPeople can choose not to have faith . So long as they pass the society on, its fine. Europe existed long before Christianity and will long after.Problem is that the religious impulse is very strong in some people and they take up a less desirable Abrahamic religion (Islam)  start believing Prog nonsense or go eco-freakI don’t know how to counter that and redirect the impulses in a healthy direction that is also natural  to the conditions in the worldNationalism as faith is just not wise and the West has been Christian for so long that’s its collapse leaves us ass out.

        How does a fish get out of the water? The culture totally envelopes you and channels your thinking, your reactions. To change, you really have to abandon the old media you’re used to. About twenty years ago I gave up on The NY Times, about three years ago quit reading NRO every day….I grew tired of their interminable posts complaining about conservatives being treated unfairly by the press…about two years ago quit watching Fox….now I read a select group of blogs, news aggregators, and read books. Much more satisfactory. Doesn’t change the world, not a single bit. But I’m happier. Tim

                What you’ve described is an evolution I went through but only earlier. Yeah. I agree with your reaction to the Sailer in the media thing, but one thing to remember is that when you are in an argument war the most important factor likely to contribute to your success is having your argument clearly understood.  The Sailer article comes closer to this than many prior ones. The bad guys are beginning to realize that simple denunciation isn’t working. Sure, they continue to insist on framing the discourse in their favor, but in setting up their straw man they are letting a few of his ideas seep through. The window is shifting.

        It’s not about controlling the debate that matters, it’s about controlling minds. Most of us will never be converted by their rhetoric nor cowed by their admonitions. Their game is to remake the mindset of society by indoctrinating our youth in their political religion. It used to be that they accomplished this via seduction into government dependency (free welfare anyone?). Now they use the mass communication media to rewire minds with repetitive messaging.
Debate is irrelevant once the zombies arise. And we will not be able to talk our way back to being a strong nation again.

        A daunting task going up against the left when they have the media and spineless politicians in their back pockets.The Trump election was a start however at the end of the day he’s just a businessman and so far just looking out for the interests of big business. Go figure.The narrative must change if any true conservative candidate is to survive the election process.A good place to start is deprogramming the children when they come home from the public school indoctrination camps.The silent majority has stayed silent too long. It won’t be easy winning the country back.

            trump’s sole purpose is/was to act as the “North star” for a large but unconnected group of people; this cannot be undone.  he was never going to do much himself, from inside the system.   secondarily (but also important) he caused all of the traitors “inside the wire” to self identify.  things are in motion on a historical scale, and none of the worms occupying center stage (for now) have a chance in hell of stopping it from sweeping them all away.

                Trump is the Alpha male and Obama is the Beta.  People unconsciously follow the Alphas and avoid the Betas.
Long way of saying that Trump is leading the new, outlawed, kids with the street cred and seductive inappropriate attitudes.  Things are changing.  They have no answer for it, so things could get interesting.

            You’re pointing out something that I have come to believe is the height of the retardation that infests the right wing.
” a good place to start is deprogramming the children”
Actually – a good place to start is to not infest the children’s heads with progressive mind virus IN THE FIRST PLACE.
The fact that so many conservatives cannot comprehend this simple truth – goes a hell of a long way towards explaining why the left constantly wins.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste – so don’t do it in the first place.

        fighting progressive theocracy must include the language. good place to start would be that hate word – immigration . it should be associated with the left exclusively and given a bad rep (should not be too difficult).as a substitute i am thinking of the old term ‘settler’ and it’s derivatives. so no more immigration reform or immigration ban – first is toxic and second implies taking something away and hitler and stuff – but let’s say settlers act or something of a kind. the term has a history and all kinds of emotional connections, it is sufficiently different from the progressive immigration and even if in the end results in reducing the number of people moving to US it is hard to make a moral argument against it because the term itself is positive.

In answer to your question about reparation talks- well, Johnny Cochrane and 4 other prominent lawyers were selling tickets to weekend workshops in D.C.The tickets were $1500.The workshops were seminars, “How to Collect Your Forthcoming Reparations Benefits”.

Please, please, PLEASE, stop using Progressive as a synonym for leftist thought. They take it as a compliment. And who in their right mind could be against “progress”? Just remember that someone that walks off a cliff is making great progress…..until they hit the ground.

        The fundamental, revolutionary idea behind Darwin’s mechanism of natural selection was of incremental change across glacial periods of time.It informed all of the natural sciences that followed- many of which had not yet been developed.

                    The quickie definition is destructive, violent leftist. It is actually more complicated than that. The Jacobins were a political club in revolutionary France that took the name of the Jacobin monastery that they met in. Their initial policy was in favor of a constitutional monarchy dominated by a single legislative body, but that turned into demands for a republic absent a king when Louis tried to escape in order to lead a counter revolution. They were initially against war with Austria and Prussia, but when the war came they were able to take advantage of the circumstances to take over the government and kill off their political opposition while doing a better job of prosecuting the war than those who had pushed for it (now all dead by guillotine).Now for the contradictions. They began by being in favor of lassez faire economics, but ended up with wage and price controls. Their opposition to government distribution of privilege led them to eliminate workmen’s guilds, making it so that collective bargaining of any kind was illegal. This last has been a mark of when leftism becomes communism. Support of unions is left wing up until the point the left has total control. Then when policy is to be directed totally by the central government, you can’t abide any blowback from those affected by the policy, so the unions are either castrated or eliminated.So the Jacobins ended up with what we today would associate with left wing policies, but the ideas they started out with were what we today would call more right wing. They were driven by circumstances coupled with lack of experience in executive functions and economics to certain actions in order to maintain power once they got it, and ended up being consumed by cognizant dissonance.I’ve ended up believing that “Jacobin” means someone who wants a change in the existing order. The history of the term can be otherwise construed to mean almost anything. A such, I have no problem with being called a Jacobin and have called myself one, but I realize that this is easily misunderstood.

        A minor quibble of little consequence to the validity of the Z’s argument: the Al Saud carry little moral authority within Saudi Arabia, other than from the most self-interested adherents of Islam’s tenets of “rendering unto Caesar.” It is the hard power of their leash on the most “excitable” elements of their society, together with the soft power of the fear that most Saudis have of the alternative (a truly medieval theocracy that would spell the end of their material pleasures) that maintains the status quo. Conversely, the mullahs enjoy greater theocratic legitimacy (as much or more an artifice of Shia religious doctrine as the piety of the religious leadership itself.) This does not diminish the reality of the mullahs’ hard power through its control of the tools of violence within the country, or the self-interest of their supporters who populate the tentacles that reach into every economic sphere of the country. Quibbles for quibbles’ sake.

        So true.
Our problem is not that people haven’t heard the truth.
Our problem is that they’ve heard it presented as something only evil low status dumb people believe.

        Great analysis. These guys are a theocracy but the right is disarmed because they share the same moral beliefs.
The Libertarians don’t . The Progressives are being taken over by the Libertarians and their fans, so it’s going to be interesting. The Libertarians are calling them pseudo-progressives. Remember the totalitarian progs were against LGBT  rights until recently then try and appropriate the Libertarian advances…
The problems in the Mid-east come from the Libertarians there and their fans working to overthrow the theocracies. They got rid of the Commies while the right rolled over to die, so let’s see.

            Yes, Left and Right share the same lust for illusory power, and demand the false authority to strike without retaliation.
