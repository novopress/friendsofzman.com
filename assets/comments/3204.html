        Well Ed, the only problem with that theory is his former teammates backed him over his alleged victim, the guy who got the boohoos when Incognito said mean things to him.
But, you are somewhat proving my point. A big pale penis person acting hyper- masculine makes everyone around him a victim according to the one true faith.

        The NFL is a criminal enterprise, run by, don’t be shocked, criminals. White face criminals own it and black face criminals work for it.“They use us up.” Tony Dorsett accurately describes the relationship between players and owners while complaining about the concussion scandal. What he implied, but didn’t say was; players, when used-up are thrown away like a used Kleenex, and given the same consideration.The NFL is the modern day version of the plantation system. Players(workers) are bought and sold in a closed market that is tilted heavily in favor of the owners. Yes, players like Dorsett that become stars are extremely well paid, most are not and have a very short shelf life.Without the collusion of government endorsed monopoly power and tax supported playing venues the NFL, as it is today, would cease to exist.

        You do realize that the relevant difference here between Incognito and the guys who abused children, beat women, and killed animals is that Incognito’s victims were his teammates, not that he is white?
Incognito’s skills are countered by the risk of his messing with other players on the team, making their play worse, and for most if not all teams its just not worth it.  If a NFL team had players who were children, women, or dogs they would probably take a pass on some of these other cases.

        See, the problem with a “cultural appropriation” of McCarthyism is that Joe McCarthy was proved to be correct.“Victims” aside, an astonishing number of folks in the entertainment and “education” industries were found to actually be communist dupes, but, that was by design.
