        Applebaum is representative of not only the US’ Deep State but that of Western Europe as well. Like her, the US/EU leadership is historically and culturally illiterate. They do not understand history nor do they know much about it. They also believe that their power is so transcendently overwhelming that Russia and other opponents must grovel and beg for scraps.The Ukraine has been part of the Russian heartland since 1667. That predates the United Kingdom and the establishment of modern France, Germany and Italy. Kiev is where the Rus began. The Ukraine (and Belarus) is also the main highway for invasions of Russia.Then there is the deep east/west split among the Ukrainian people. Yanukovych got majorities of over 60% to over 90% in the east and lost by similar majorities in the west. Many members of the current Ukrainian government have called for ethnic cleansing of the eastern ethnic Russians. And a lot of anti-Russian legislation has been passed that strips the Russian of their civil rights.Putin’s proxy war in the east is succeeding because it has the support of the eastern Ukrainian population, both ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians. Peace will come to Ukraine only if it is partitioned.

        Reading Snyder’s “Bloodlands” again.  Seems germane.

        The West seems as clueless about the Middle East and about Japan-China as it appears to be about Russia.  This does not bode well for anyone.  There is a point where even the best of a bad set of choices is hemmed in by the decisions and happenings of the recent past.  I fear we have passed that Rubicon already.

        It’s my usual bitch about how history is taught. It’s taught as though it’s static. Whatever happened was destined to happen. That is why we have such a clueless bunch in our country. They are historically illiterate. They do not understand that the choices made today will directly impact their future.
Vera Brittain’s actual diary of events leading to WWI shows how quickly public opinion can swing from being against war to being for it. (And the public swing against the Vietnam war happened over a short period of months.) My feeling is that this will not end well.

        “The thing about American politicians and strategists is they always assume the other guys think like they think.”Most of our politicians and high level bureaucrats are out of their depth when they are dealing with other countries and international relations.  While we have many talented specialist on specific countries or ethnicities typically they are never in a decision making position and their advice is generally either nought sought out or ignored by the elected and appointed leaders.  Generally speaking this is not true for leaders of most other countries.  Most European leaders have an extensive knowledge of other European countries as well as Russia and all foriegn leaders have studied the United States.  In international relations we are more like checker players playing chess with master chess players.  We often/usually get the short end of economic and military agreements/treaties and then we go back home and ignore the rest of the world until something serious catches our attention.  Our long range planning typically consists of preparing for the next election cycle while the rest of the world looks and plans ahead years and even decades.  What is truely amazing in my opinion is that we still exist considering how badly we play the game.  I am not sure our lucky streak will continue.

        My sense of the situation is that the average Joe in Ukraine hasn’t come out ahead since the collapse of the USSR. The country has been run by kleptocrats and suffers from rampant corruption and an unstable economy. People want order and good government. That they see the possibility of those things in an opportunistic Putin is telling of their disenchantment.The West is not obligated to do anything for Ukraine but there is the feeling that Russia is up to it’s old Soviet tricks and should be countered. Obama needs to know if this is a hand he’s willing to go all in on. If not, it might be better to fold and be patient.We live in interesting times.

        I do not think Putin has any intention of provoking war with the West. He is not nearly so bold as was Adolf in his day, and Adolf had a precise understanding of the character of his enemies. So does Vlad. Hell, so do we. Vlad loves, loves, loves calling bs on the affectations of the West, which is payback for the extreme humiliation of Russia and rebuilds the general confidence and identity of what is Russia, apparently including the birthrate.Putin will press harder in lands where Russians live in Eastern Europe it is true, but he will only take what the West is unwilling to defend, which so far is everything. So be it.It should be no surprise that no one in government understands Russia when clearly no one in government ever understood the middle-east. Methinks a person joins USG in order to press on for the nirvana of one world government, which precludes a curiosity for imagining how anyone could feel differently.

        If innocent, non-combatants start dying that’s when shit will hit the fan. I predict Putin will never let that happen, or in other words, he’s no Hitler, even if there are some comparisons between the invasion of Poland
