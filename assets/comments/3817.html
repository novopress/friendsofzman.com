        PK and moi: two minds with but a single thought.
At Penthouse I always looked to hire the younger writers when I didn’t need a byline for the cover. They were easy to get on the cheap and you could swing them on a cord.

            Oh, I’m fine with hiring kids to do reporting. TV news, for example, is just a TV show based on the news. No one wants to some hairy troll reading the weather forecast. I like my weather delivered by a bimbo. In the print world, having young people report on your topics makes sense as they are cheap and eager. I get annoyed when they dress of mall cops and pretend they are a former member of MI6.But, they play that game with old guys too. Mike Baker has been turned into Derek Flint by Fox News. Some of the nutty things he says on TV make me think hiring children would be better.

        “As an adult, I have no reason to care what this young fellow has to say about anything so why in the world is he offered up as an expert?”
It is simplicity itself, Z-Man.

        NRO is pretty bad, so I’m not sure how author’s age alone would be sufficient in exculpating the unfortunate from the boredom  induced by visiting that site.

        I’d rather be tyrannized by baffled people, if that is even possible, than people who knew what they were doing, which has certainly been the case for some time. I will assume the baffled young marionettes are having their strings pulled by the usual crowd to present a hipper image for an old act. Bill Ayers probably doesn’t like people walking on his lawn either.

        Psaki and Harf.  As kidz say these days:  “……Really???!!”
Here’s another piece from the National Review, reiterating what I’ve been saying for as long as these two first appeared.
I’ll only add that you could get away with these two representing the EPA, or HUD.  But STATE?  Diplomacy has been the province of wizened old folks for centuries  (and still is, in saner parts of the globe.)
In the days of “The Ugly American” we were hated. Now we are just laughed at.
