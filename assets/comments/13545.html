        The greater explicitness of anti-white rhetoric from the mainstream media forces more white people, who would rather believe in multiethnic pleasantries, to face the tribal nature of (most) non-whites.  For example, a very liberal acquaintance of mine was visibly shaken when I recounted what happened at Evergreen State College.  Specifically, prior to 2017, the non-whites had a ‚ÄúDay without Minorities‚Äù day during which they did not go to campus.  In 2017, they decided that the ‚ÄúDay without Minorities‚Äù should entail the whites not coming to campus.  My acquaintance was forced to recognize that she won‚Äôt be granted an exemption from the coming conflicts because she is a ‚Äúwhite ally.‚Äù

        The difficulty and opportunities are going to be the overall lack of knowledge of the masses. Most working people get up, go to work, come home, take care of kids, eat dinner, go to bed. Or some variation of those things. They spend little time researching things and will require everything thing presented on a silver platter.The parasitic class will go along with what ever the ruling class comes up with as long as the checks keep coming and more importantly clearing.Whatever the opposition comes up with needs to recognize the public at large has the attention span of a gnat.

            Someone with a decent IQ and stock movie-making software can put together a five to ten minute video that summarizes an issue and also provides motivation to the troops. Look up ‚ÄúTurn it off‚Äù by ‚ÄúThe Alternative Hypothesis‚Äù on YouTube as an example.

            This is one reason why guerrilla theater can be more effective than lecturing. Even overwhelmed working stiffs can usually find a couple of minutes for entertainment on the long drive home.

            A problem with using words like ‚Äùmasses‚Äù or ‚Äùproles‚Äù is that they deny people a human face.  Nobody is a hero or philosopher-king these days.  People who get on with life may be the smart ones.

            What about when the checks stop coming?They can‚Äôt keep the current ways of spending forever. They can do it for a long time ‚Äì and already have.  But they can‚Äôt do it forever.  Sooner or later somebody is going to want to cash in their chips.  And I‚Äôve already seen quite a bit of evidence over the last 10 years or so that there‚Äôs a significant part of the white working class ‚Äì who have said : ‚Äúfuck this ‚Äì I‚Äôm out ‚Äì I‚Äôm not going to play this game any more‚Äù.As an example:  the net effect of Black Lives Matter‚Äôs constant whining  among a lot of white guys I know ‚Äì has been a change of attitude from ‚Äù poor discriminated against black people ‚Äù ‚Ä¶. to:  ‚Äù screw them ‚Äì get a freaking job and stop your bitching ‚Äú.People who know their money is being stolen and given to their enemies ‚Äì tend to at least *attempt* to change that.   That alone is a significant difference from the willing bend-overs most US taxpayers have been doing for about a century.

        Jonathan Haidt got a lot wrong in his book on social intuitionism, but he‚Äôs right that one of the main ingredients necessary to attract people to a position or a movement is to be attractive. This can mean literally good-looking or well put-together in a bespoke suit (a lot of the hand-wringing over Jared Taylor or Richard Spencer‚Äôs existence is that they are the ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù or ‚Äúgenteel‚Äù face of white supremacy, with degrees and clean-cut appearances, etc.), but a position of power is also attractive. Trump‚Äôs ace in the hole was pretty simple: Money. He was too rich to care about losing a gig over doxxing, and he told the people who hold the Sword of Damocles over wage slaves to go fuck themselves. The slaves who liked the rebellious warlord voted for him because he could say things they couldn‚Äôt, on their behalf, and he could go unpunished (which furthered the sedition against the ruling class). You see this with Mel Gibson, too. He says one thing while drunk about Jews and the powers that be (especially Ari Emanuel, Rahm‚Äôs brother in L.A.) try to isolate him and target him for destruction, but there‚Äôs one problem: He self-finances and recoups because he‚Äôs supported by people who either don‚Äôt care about his personal opinion of Jews or share his opinion. Also he‚Äôs very talented and he‚Äôs not a degenerate. If your mansion has thick walls, the antifa fags can‚Äôt catapult their fat transgender carcasses over the walls to poison your kingdom. I know my solution isn‚Äôt brilliant or easily attainable, but it is simple: We need some people with money on our side.

Fuckerberg. Cankles. Bernie Sanders. Rachel Maddow. Morning Joe. Fat, fish mouthed lesbians with green streaks in their hair. Noodle armed soy boys with gaping mouth selfies begging to give a blowjob. There might be some correlation between looks and social dominance. This would explain why the left has lost so much of their media power. No one wants to look at them.There have been exceptions. The gay mulatto is an example of how a dog turd may be polished. Gays and liberal females found something attractive about a Dumbo eared mixed breed. That was just an example of the ‚Äúsoft bigotry‚Äù of low expectations the left has for minorities. Make sure they can speak well. Make sure they can read a teleprompter. Dress them up in tailored suits. As Baba Wawa said, his admirers thought he was the next messiah. The media adulation of this incompetent low IQ placeholder is one of the many things that made people realize that they are completely compromised. The left still have the courts and the educational establishment. But the fake news media is dying. And if something that has been weaponized to the tune of trillions of dollars can be crippled, so can the courts. The educational system will take longer. It is too useful as a baby sitting service for working mothers. Until we strangle feminism and repair the economy enough to support single paycheck families with stay at home moms, that won‚Äôt change. That may have to wait until after the apocalypse.

            Respectability has both a visual and presentation dimension. Taylor pulls both off quite well. Spencer has much better visual than presentation, where he has made blunders. The majority of dissident right figures excel at neither. Those who delight in being visually and presentationally edgy should be presumed as bad actors.

                Respectability is about looks and presentation.  People who look and act edgy shouldn‚Äôt be trusted.
Those are your first and last sentences as written by a normal person.  Pretentious writers shouldn‚Äôt be trusted.  And there‚Äôs a whole bunch of them here.

                There are two groups of persuadables, old and young, and they are engaged by different messengers.  Respectability helps persuade the few older people who are sufficiently dissatisfied to listen.  Edginess helps persuade the young, who see affluence receding.  The problem with the respectability argument is that there are very few persuadable older people.Mike Enoch has persuaded more people in 3 years than Jared Taylor has in 3 decades, and Mike has persuaded the young.  And I greatly admire Jared Taylor.  I wish we lived in a world where his intellect and character were more resonant.Do you want to win or do you want to be dignified?Finally, we don‚Äôt have to choose one of these two approaches.  We just need to ensure that they don‚Äôt fight each other.

                Neither project strength. Trump does and as a result, men want to be him and women want to be with him. For some reason, virility and raw masculinity are shunned in dissident circles. I believe the line of reasoning is ‚Äúyou‚Äôll scare the normies.‚Äù
We don‚Äôt need boring, crusty boomers or metrosexuals. We need warrior-philosophers, Spartans, Crusaders. We need to project strength and wisdom at the same time, yet too many of us fear our own strength.

        You‚Äôre not seeing the forest for the trees, Z. The left is on the run.They had the social war sewn up: The schools are pozzed, the courts are a joke, and with the media singing the official tune, all was well.Today public schools are less than bad day cares; America‚Äôs best and brightest  are being home or private-schooled. Because the courts don‚Äôt work, Americans dispense justice right at the crime scene via the Second Amendment. The mass media now only caters to the loons or geriatric hippies and can‚Äôt sell a newspaper. Even Sloppy Williamson can‚Äôt find a job because he has to compete with guys like you that can think, write, and chew bubble gum, and provide a superior product for free.Nor can Lefty operate in the shadows anymore. We are taking names and making records same as they are. Hillary Clinton, the Jewish Hollywood Perverts, etc‚Ä¶ They are getting burned at the stake regularly too. And now‚Ä¶ On his own social media platforms, they are losing there too. If Zuckerface politicizes that platform to favour pedos, homos, and hairy chested feminists, they‚Äôll be the only ones that will use it, and the social media will go the same way the mass media did.That‚Äôs why I think we‚Äôll see a first, second or third gen war soon ‚Äì these skirmishes and sparring sessions aren‚Äôt teaching our Cloud people anything. It‚Äôs time to kill them and replace them.Or watch our civilization collapse.

                Stopped by to see Amy Wax collect her NAS ‚ÄúCourage in Academia‚Äù award last Thursday.  Her talk afterward was chilling in describing the thoroughness with which leftists have run the table in academia.  This will get worse before getting better.  On a positive note, finally got to meet Derbyshire.

        While a five to ten-minute video may offer a summary, it will still be too long for the masses. Unfortunately, most people seem to get most of their information from headlines and sound bites.As an example. A former coworker has never fired a rifle or a shotgun, in fact would be hard pressed to tell them apart. He has two handguns that he hasn‚Äôt fired in over twenty years, in fact he doesn‚Äôt even know how to clean them. Yet, when there was all this recent discussion about banning modern sporting rifles this expert was all for it. When presented with facts he didn‚Äôt want to hear them. He and the wife live in a bubble and don‚Äôt want to know what goes on outside.

        ZMan, a few additional points about fourth-generation warfare ‚Äì or 4GW as it is known to those conversant with Lind‚Äôs generations-of-war model. William Lind was one of the acolytes of the late Colonel John Boyd, perhaps the finest military theorist this nation (USA) has ever produced.Boyd was famous in the Pentagon for his briefings and lengthy talks on the history and nature of war. Boyd himself had undertaken a lengthy and in-depth study of war across the ages ‚Äì after retiring from the military and taking a post in the Pentagon.Boyd is perhaps most famous for his OODA loop ‚Äì ‚ÄúObserve, orient, decide, act‚Äù ‚Äì and his observation that successful warrior often get inside of the decision-making (OODA) loop of their enemies.Boyd‚Äôs quest was ignited by his service in Vietnam, where he sought an answer to the question of how a small, relatively-backward nation like North Vietnam was winning the war against a super-power ‚Äì the United States.Colonel Boyd‚Äôs work was never committed to a formal publication such as a magazine or book. Instead, his marathon lecture, ‚ÄúPatterns of Conflict,‚Äù sometimes 6-8 hours in length, was the forum in which he expressed his ideas. Only later did his associates and former colleagues collect and formalize his work.Boyd was famous as a maverick and unconventional thinker, one utterly unimpressed with the perquisites of rank or protocols of the military. He was known to tear into generals, face-to-face, if he felt the situation called for it. ‚ÄúGhengis John‚Äù was his nickname for his scorched-earth, take-no-prisoners attitude and behavior. Boyd didn‚Äôt suffer fools too well, but he could also be a remarkably kind and gentle man, according to those who knew him ‚Äì as well as a person of considerable moral rectitude.Boyd was famous for thundering at his audience ‚ÄúPeople, ideas and technology ‚Äì in that order!‚Äù and also for stressing that the mental and moral aspects of war-fighting trump the physical. Tactical and operational superiority does not necessarily lead to strategic victory, if one‚Äôs grand strategy was fatally flawed. A lesson Germany learned in WWII and that the USA learned in SE Asia.Those interested in learning more about one of the most-fascinating military men this country has ever produced may wish to pick up a copy of Robert Coram‚Äôs biography, entitled ‚ÄúBoyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War.‚Äù

Puts up a bit of a front but can be relied upon to acquiesce, and even turn on right wingers.You put out some heavy right wing shit in his name, maybe even using his own accounts. It doesn‚Äôt even need to be that hard core. Just enough to get him harassed or fired. Brought before some lib tribunal.It‚Äôs  a way of cleaning up the movement and getting rid of people who punch to the right and at the same time keep normies wondering about whether or not they might end up jobless for wrongthink and how it might be better if freedom of conscience were valued once again.

            Imagine some white male engineer working at twitter. He‚Äôs just a guy who likes money and does not care for all the PC lunacy. Most white males at these companies have no interest in this stuff. Now, imagine some of his female co-workers get notes claiming that the guy is secretly in the alt-right. Maybe one of those gals is in HR. Before long, our white male engineer is being hauled into HR to answer questions about his life.Alternatively, imagine the female HR shrew who spends her time nosing around in the lives of her co-workers. She lives with her bet male husband in a nice suburb. Her neighbors start getting blind mailers making claims about her that are not flattering. All of a sudden. our nosy shrew is wondering who is targeting her. Everyone becomes a suspect.

We also see fake news fed to MSM for subsequent clarification which will further steepen their decline.
All the Internet needs is an example or two and it will become a wave. It is the power of non-hierarchical, complex systems, and virtually impossible to target.
BTW, I chose the two examples above because when the left abandoned the rule of law and due process, they rely on authority. The internet makes that a very easy target.

        There‚Äôs always a reluctance on the right to use the ‚Äúfight fire with fire‚Äù method.  It‚Äôs commendable conservative America has always taking the high road, but we‚Äôre fighting some truly despicable people.
Would like to see an alt right version of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Create a organization with a humanitarian mission ( making it unchallengeable like the NRA  ) but use it to go after and discredit the lefty loonies.

                Yeah that‚Äôs because today‚Äôs   conservatives leaders  are looter-cucks who conserve nothing other than their posh gigsThey don‚Äôt care about anything other than money and being liked and are basically Democrats from the Clinton era at bestThe real conservative people are out there of course but the Fake Right especially hates them on class grounds  much the same way the elite hates President Trump.In the end the Fake Right  are going to have to removed from power and someone far more akin to European Ultra Nationalists will have to run the show if the nation is to surviveThe only upside is maybe thy can be redeemed  along with their cousins the Liberals. Those sides are just stupid and greedy but neither are evil in the way the Left is.Of course getting the Right off its ass can be troublesome but its starting,  Its civilization or Leftism and you can‚Äôt have both.

            Wish that were so, but I fear that it may be our confidence in firearms that has become obsolete against the quality of state arms, against the surveillance state, drones, social control, a weakened native stock, and an indifferent or  hostile immigrant stock. Like High Noon, Marshal Kane wrote out his will and stayed to fight because that is who he was, but his search for volunteers demonstrated that the town was not worth saving. I question that we have a nation or a people left to reclaim. Z‚Äôs idea improves the quality and attractiveness of the resistance stock.

        I have read a couple of Lind‚Äôs books.*  The Wiki article is the usual, shallow ‚Äòsome say X, others say not X.‚Äô**  They entirely missed that the best potentially trenchant criticism of Lind‚Äôs ideas is historical.That is, throughout history, an insurgency using guerrilla warfare methods ordinarily needed to gain the support of an external power that its target either cannot get at or fears to strike in order to succeed.  Otherwise the targeted established power can usually summon the wherewithal to eventually crush it.  Even with external support, the insurgents still need to fight well to succeed.***  Lind address the latter, necessary-but-not-sufficient, aspect only, but well. IMHO.Examples from American History:‚Äì The Native American insurgency during the French &amp; Indian War collapsed once the French base of support in Canada was eliminated by the English Army.‚Äì The American Revolution was on shaky grounds until it gained extensive French army and naval support following our victory at Saratoga.‚Äì The Ohio Valley was impossible to settle due to Native American insurgency until our victory in the war of 1812 removed their British support.‚Äì Vietnam was lost in no small part because our ‚Äòbest and brightest‚Äô feared a re-run of McArthur‚Äôs Korean Yalu River debacle from China and so refused to deal with the massive aid China and Russia gave to North Vietnam.‚Äì The  Russians lost in Afghanistan because Reagan dared to support the insurgents in the face of much elite subversion and caterwauling.‚Äì We will lose in Afghanistan because our elite will not deal with the duplicitous Paki‚Äôs and ‚Äòour friends, the Gulf Arabs‚Äô.‚Äì We are fighting other losing rearguard actions in Syria and Iraq because our elite refuses to deal with Iran.Note: I do not say that any of these wars are either just or unjust.  But, as Clausewitz says, wars have their own logic that you ignore at your peril.  That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre better not started, particularly for non-existential reasons.______________________________________*He was spot on re Maneuver Warfare ‚Äì but easy to say, hard to do.** ‚ÄòHe never smelled powder‚Äô is only a sometimes relevant criticism concerning proposed tactics that are too elaborate to actually execute.  But Lind is about *tactical doctrine* and not, mostly, about strategy or operations.  The tactical doctrine he proposes has been used since the dawn of time and so ought not be controversial, per se.  When to use it is the main point under discussion.*** The essential point of a guerrilla war strategy is to keep the enemy on the horns of a dilemma: If he concentrates his forces, the guerrillas dominate the the countryside.  If he disperses his forces to go after the guerrillas, you hit and defeat his scattered units with your own (usually foreign supplied) main force units and attack his cities (e.g. battle of Saigon &amp; Hue in 1968).

        The Culture War / Civil War 2.0 / American Social War / whatever is, indeed a 4GW.  And will continue to be a 4GW up to the point that contiguous territory is bitten off from the USA and a functioning gov‚Äôt and political apparatus is implemented in that territory.True, 4GW may be a new term, but it puts a name to the concept in the context with the post-Westphalia Western concepts of warfare.  USMC, AF, Navy, and Big Army all consider guerilla warfare to not really be war and 4GW allows (some of) them to think of it as ‚Äúreal war.‚Äù.  Most will continue to think discount 4GW until the state they serve dissolves around them.  The more effective US Gov‚Äôt/ruling class forces will be LEO and intel.  Both are already conditioned to take the hammer to Americans on American soil.

            That may come sooner than you ever expect. Consider if you will, Illinois or California going belly up due to respective pension crises. They will look for federal assistance.  That always comes with strings usually not of a favorable kind. Several other states that are being asked to belly up the cash might well insist they sit on an approval for all expenditures. (precedent for that in US bankruptcy law. Just not to the States yet.)In an effort to right the ship all boatloads of Liberal pipe dreams might get flushed. Personally I like the territorial governor approach. Plenary veto till all bills are paid.

            I was captivated by this story yesterday, not so much by the arrest of the two men but by the sheer number of white people who openly confessed that they routinely sit in Starbucks for hours without making a purchase. WTH?It‚Äôs inconceivable to me that anyone would presume to take space in a coffee shop/restaurant/bar without making a purchase. It‚Äôs disrespectful to the business owner, who has payments to make. Worse, it‚Äôs disrespectful to the workers who make a substantial portion of their pay in tips. I had no idea this takes place. What type of asshole does this?The two black guys richly deserved their fate by refusing the reasonable requests of the manager and then the police to vacate the premises. With any luck Starbucks will start tossing out the white freeloaders as well.

            Violence is fairly useless in domestic conflict. It only works when the object is a distinct ‚Äúother‚Äù that the public cannot relate to emotionally. So if you fantasize about violence in the streets, you need to get busy ‚Äúotherizing‚Äù the people in charge.

                Its starting.The Right‚Äôs problem though is wisely its terrified of what needs to be done, Leftist carriers made into Non People, Foreigners forced out if they won‚Äôt leave  voluntarily and acting Collectively for Collective ends.The last is probably the biggest problem, way too many Right wingers are openly uncooperative with groups larger than a family or at absolutely most a county. You can‚Äôt run a society like that and to be honest such people are worse than the LeftThe Left is my enemy , will always lie and can never be trusted to keep a treaty. I get this. I can even respect such a point of view after a fashion.  Its utilitarian and somewhat logical oddly enoughI have no use for someone who is on my side and is not all in . They‚Äôll cut and run like an Arab army , lost a few kinsman ? Sorry I‚Äôm outSuch armies always lose to more disciplined forces and usually to shit forces too who at least are whipped into battleIn the end the Right will need to understand that the Left is a collective, hive mind and treat it like they would a hive of bugs , all the bugs are responsible for the hives actionsHopefully we can do this without violence but if we can‚Äôt if minarchists  ‚Äúmuh family‚Äù and ‚Äúmuh rugged individualism .‚Äù are all you care about you are part of the problemLike the old Franklin  flag said ‚ÄúJoin or Die‚ÄùAs a caveat, this is why a separation would be optimum for casualty reduction if it could be done. This way the uncooperative people could be kettled in their own areas well away from the sane people  who want a culture and are willing to use force to get it

        ‚ÄúGiven the disparity in power, resistance to the ruling orthodoxy will have to be irregular, but within the narrow bounds of the law.‚ÄùYou assume that banner hanging and putting up posters is within the narrow bounds of the law. That is not true. It is illegal, at least in Europe. Simply hanging a banner or putting up a poster is a petty offence. Depending on the message of the banner or poster, it can also be a felony.Sure, doing such things is not very risky. If you get caught (unlikely if you are putting up a poster in the middle of the night), you‚Äôll merely be fined.However, I expect things to escalate. In Brittain a guy was sentenced to a few days of prison for placing ham on the door of a mosque. As prison populations in Europe are mostly muslims, that was a death sentence. The other inmates knew what he had done and a group of them beat him to death.

        Great question! The first answer is that you need access to the modeling tools that permit reasonable analysis and forecasting of macro-scale social phenomena. Then you need to understand that hi-tech memetic manipulation of the masses is already occurring and this is fundamentally altering the human species. These changes are being accomplished via intentional manipulation of the social environment and humans naturally respond to these drivers. Do this repetitively and long enough, and you will change habits in the main body of the population. In order words, our descendants will adapt to the new environment, for better or for worse. Spoiler ‚Äì the current macro-drivers are designed to produce subliminal and compliant hive behavior (worker bees).

        To this point, the bad behavior of the elites and provoking or exposing that bad behavior has been the most effective red pill, not making persuasive arguments on the superiority of our side.
