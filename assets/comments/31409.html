        Apparently, the last year the Republicans can win an election is 2028. This is due to demographic changes ongoing in the 50 states, a situation embraced by Democrats today but when the immigration laws were reformed in the 1960s Ted Kennedy himself went so far as to say “there will be no change in ethnic composition” of the immigrants. Right.Like a fish out of water, the Republican Party will be forced to embrace the new, colored voters, who are feted daily by the Democrats and even today displayed in all the ads we see in the various media. The Republicans will do it but they will hate it, because their model remains the 1950s white dad with a feather in his hat, but change is coming, rest assured.The political landscape, slowly but steadily turning blue for Democrats, cannot turn blue fast enough to please the Party of Clinton. The next generation of Democrats is already in place to take advantage of it with pinheads like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drooling on the sidelines.It would be amusing if Z Man were right, and the political system caught fire like a Pittsburgh river with its toxic effluents, but I — Greg — suspect things are stable. Unless a tremendous mutant arrives on the scene, in the year 2124 we’ll still be seeing the same old political parties on the holographic news.[To read more of my writings, click on my name]

            The two states at the vanguard of post-America are Michigan and Florida. Michigan is the electoral laboratory for Our Democracy, the first state to kick an “insurrectionist” off a ballot, and Florida is where the total destruction of the 1st Amendment is being tested: DeSantis’s Jew stuff, prosecutions of /pol/ anons for obviously un-actionable “in Minecraft”-posting, and now this guy who apparently got fedded into *described a hypothetical type of person*, and for that he’ll go to prison for almost ever.
Michigan is a loss. Florida is a trap.

        Who gives a damn anymore? Time for a National Divorce has nearly arrived and we are one financial or political disaster from the events that set the Dissolution of The United States into motion.The Demosheviks will of course start a civil war to prevent this, but this time they will wake up to the fact that many firearms manufacturers are getting the hell out of Communist New England and going to The South, so they will have a real munitions supply problem.At this point in time, get to know who your neighbors are, and arm to the teeth. The Dissolution is coming, whether people like it or not.

        ‘In the end, the normal person is left wondering to wonder if it is time to take the old advice from the hippies and turn off, tune out, drop out of the system.’Somebody pass the patchouli!  I do believe I’m having a Fab Four Flashback.Back then the boys were dropping SandOz, I remember it all so very well, uh ok it’s murky.  Nowadays it’s the Red Pill the chaps are chomping, not to run from reality, but to confront and embrace it.  I downed my own Reddie in the early Nineties and gave the Big Middle One to the Sistem.  For evah.Men have quietly been dropping out of The Beest for a couple decades now . . . those not already forced out by various machinations of the Perennially Oppressed, that is.  Independent-type doods can only be told for so many decades that they are hated, not wanted, and the Source of All Evil.  So be it.As the real talent continues to withdraw, it’ll be felt by the Regime and the Almighty People in more than pussified, woke movies.  Infrastructure, tech, local repairs, your WATER and POWER . . . you best know the right hombres in the future.  You better have a group of men you can count on, when the gynarchy hits the Big Wall.

                        Saw one report having it at 50% over the last five years, so that sounds better so that would make it 10% p.a. for the period.  Wish it was more.

        This is why I’ve had some money down in Vegas for a while now on the prop bet “There shall be Australia-style mandatory voting in the US before 2030.” It’s increasingly obvious that The Regime regards “American” elections the same way Kim Jong-un regards elections in North Korea: As a wonderful opportunity for The Workers to demonstrate how much they love their rulers. Chomo Joe vs. War Karen will be an easy victory for Chomo, even without the Fortification…. but he’ll “win” on about 20% voter turnout. Which is unacceptable. Don’t you love us, Citizen? You will be made to.

            I kinda always somehow pictured I would end up in prison, but I’ve never been real clear on why. Maybe refusing to vote will be the reason. For a minute there I thought it might be for refusing the jab or refusing to wear a mask.
I think we are a lot closer to a War Karen presidency than you do. The left’s base is united against Trump, not united for Biden.

        Really these days I’m more interested in mass meme formation such as two recent really memorable examples: Deobras the Flying Felon (how many joggers will learn to fly?) and the ultra-Orthodox crawling out of sidewalk grates and running off like Yeshiva students. That’s much more fulfilling than wondering about who’s on a ballot form.

        “If voting is not a complete farce and the regime is committed to rigging the results even if the votes are counted honestly, then what is the point?”Your point is well made.  I believe, given what I perceive, that there *are* still enough Joe Normies out there who believe in the system to make the pretense of democratic rule, i.e., election process, still worth the effort.  That number is however shrinking election cycle to election cycle, and one day as they say, “the juice will no longer be worth the squeeze”.No longer a voter, I sit back and take solace in the knowledge that the process (farce of democratic rule) is deteriorating election cycle to election cycle.  Once that’s gone, we may make actual progress toward solutions to our current condition.

                You assume I might be hinting at repairing this current governmental concept.  That’s doubtful and more to the point, I’m not that smart.  🙁      Anyway, whatever happens, we will never be without a ruling clique—however short a duration that may prove.

After announcing he, his wife and kid had ‘Covid’ for the umpteenth time, does not blink an eye when I say, “gah-lee, sure lucky you got those twenty jabs, eh?”To which this highly educated retard replies, without recognition, not even a flicker, “surely sure, it could have been worse.”This particular retard is in the “information” business for what it is worth. Sometime I will have to query him on what information he is forming his opinion on. But really, my approach to Joe Retard(s) is send them on their way.

                    Tired Citizen:  Peruse any comment thread anywhere on the latest DEI outrage.  Lots of people complaining – but the basis of their complaint is that such a policy is “divisive” and we should instead focus on what “unites” us, because we are all “equal.”
Idiots, top to bottom.  False reality built on the unnatural and false premise of egalitarianism.  Whole issue of what constitutes a national identity is based on lies.
Yes, even knowing how destructive it will be for all sides, and how perilous, there is no fixing this short of war and/or dissolution.

            Stay home. Circle the wagons.  Assess your neighbors and friends, and begin to circle the wagons with them. Too late for  “of this world.” Just a matter of degree. Ed Dutton has waved his arms in his Autistic way pondering that we may take it as far down as the great Bronze Age collapse. Whatever. Too late to waste time on this of the world gas lighting. Take stock of your skills. Get prepared. Get your mind prepared. As this shit goes down, it’s going to look more like Franz Kafka unleashed The Metamorphosis, people falling into ditches, desperately clinging to their iPhones, screaming, twitching, crying, and attacking. Hell, the cartels from Ecuador may be breaking down your door soon.Don’t waste your time with this shite. You’re trying to ambulate a dead man walking. I “may” vote locally. In the last local election last November, a bunch of us voted down the multi kazillion dollar New Prison bond, and the money grows on trees bond to build more schools and replace school grass with astro turf. F that. Voted down. Small town voting sometimes works.Circle your wagons. Civil war is coming. Do you really want to cobble and desperately patch together a country with over half full of crazy angry childless karens, blue haired truculent cat women, people who hate themselves, hate their sex and go in for bunny bondage, dress like a cat and poop in a cat box, are covered with tats and fishing tackle and hair that screams crazy, with a majority on mental meds? And gen z afraid of ordering from a menu. First to land in the ditch. What’s up with that kind of crazy! F that.PS Best to you and your new home, Z.

        Speaking of refusing to participate and dropping out:  Monday is Martin Luther King Day, a festival of anti-white hatred.  I intend to celebrate the day like I have the last four or five years;  I pay homage to black culture by calling in sick.
All white folks should boycott working on Hate Whitey Day and see how things go.

        Typically, people who don’t vote just don’t care. They have a deep-rooted understanding that it’s meaningless. Not voting however among the politically conscious is in a different category. To not vote and to care is somewhat trying. I did it once with Mittens/Ryan on the ballot. That is to say, I didn’t vote but I cared that I didn’t have anyone to vote for. To not vote because you understand that it really is meaningless takes a revolution in thought about the “democratic” process. Old habits die hard but I think I’m nearly there.

            Zman:  ” If voting is not a complete farce and the regime is committed to rigging the results even if the votes are counted honestly..”That must describe all presidential elections from 1992 to 2016.  The choices offered were awful because the regime rigged the primaries to give us Bush, Clinton, Dole, Clinton, Bush, Gore, Bush, Horseface, Obama, McCain, Obama, Romney, Clinton…  What a rogues gallery!In 2016 the regime slipped and the voters got their choice on the Republican ballot.  So in 2020 the gloves came off and the votes were just ignored.  Maybe it’s better that way – knowing the system is rigged, rather than just suspecting it.

        In other news, Zillow predicts the South and Great Lakes will be the hot real estate markets in 2024. MAGA country iow.They say mass immigration is invasion, and I agree, but the domestic refugees with city money are the tip of the spear. Don’t ever forget that, even though they seem relatable, are looking for sanity and lower COL, etc.It’s a fully merchant culture, worshipping the Almighty Dollar, Muh Market, and the Invisible Hand. Exalting the weak and/or clever.Maybe that’s the inversion, or at least what makes it hard to see. Just a little reintroduction of warrior culture might fix our problems, inject some honesty and clarity.Idk. PS national politics is a joke.

        The only way to fight this CRAZINESS is to stay home on election day and punish the faux Republican Party with indifference and electoral defeat. Yes, this means another 4 years of open borders and financial suicide, thereby resulting in another 15 million illegals entering the country and being made into “voting citizens by fiat” and adding another $15 trillion in sovereign debt. But this insanity will trigger the collapse much sooner than anyone expects. And then its Katie-bar-the-door time and things get very interesting very quickly. Will you survive the initial chaos? That is the only reality you can influence in the near term.

        Since I’m still registered to vote and my country never cleans up its voter rolls, my only question for this election is 1). Do I throw the ballot in the garbage?  2). Do I return it as a blank ballot?  3). Do I send the form to remove myself from the voter rolls?   Each one of these choices is as meaningless as pissing into the Ocean, so I’m leaning garbage.  Sending the form to remove myself from the rolls would give me a 20 second high. Probably not worth it.

            My instinct is that you attempt to remove yourself from the rolls but make it as time consuming as possible for the people involved.  Sand in the gears.

            JR Wirth: Remove yourself from the rolls.  Eventually it will cut way down on the junk mail you receive.  Another reason I called and had my name removed (was quite a simple process in Texas at least) was to avoid getting called for jury duty.  Not a guarantee, of course, but they primarily use voter rolls for that.  After being forced to waste a month on a jury, I never want anything to do with what passes for the US legal system again.Fwiw, both my husband and I declined to register to vote when we got our new drivers’ licenses after moving.  I also used a friend’s business address when having our mail forwarded (and she then passed it on to me).  I have since updated our correct home address with any creditors, our bank, health insurance, etc., but we have essentially gotten nothing but legitimate business mail since April.Yesterday we got our first piece of junk mail – a mass-mailer flyer for Nimrata.  Not sure what list she found our name on; husband thinks she just mass mailed everyone in the area  (I will have to ask the neighbors if they were similarly afflicted).  I was very unhappy to see this assault upon our short-lived mail anonymity.

In our state, I can say with almost certainty it would be the Department of Motor Vehicles, either DLs or vehicle titles/registrations. Could have been utilities or damn near anyone else for that matter, including the company that handled your closing. Unless in real life you adopted an alias, it would be trivial to link a new address to your old, and all that entails. And even with an alias, unless you also changed all your habits, your patterns betray you.

                When you have to give your name and address to anybody, change the spelling slightly for each recipient of your postal info.
If your name is Smith, give it to organization A as “Smith.” To Org B, spell it “Smits.” To the next, spell it “Smyth.” To the next, spell it “Smythe.” And keep a little record of each spelling and to whom you gave each spelling.
Then you will see who has sold your name and address, and you can take it from there.
It works.

                I’ve gotten two or three texts from War Karen. I’m guessing some sort of mass text program. I opted out of it on the first one and gave rude replies on all of them. I’m sure it’s from a no reply number but it made me feel better.
I’ve not contributed to a candidate and subscribe to nothing that the repubs would buy there mailing list. It bothers me that a street-shitter like her has access to my number.

            If one wishes to maximize benefit, then reducing effort is the name of the game—toss the ballot out.  However, there is some data here that mail in ballots have been duplicated and falsely cast for infrequent voters (voting records for past participation are public record).  Therefore, returning a ballot—even if blank—will produce evidence of dual mail in voting and potential fraud.  Not that it now matters as the courts do nothing, but behalf one day…

            The truth is it doesn’t matter what you do and you’ve already spent too much time thinking about it.  The beauty of having a king or a dictator is that they don’t get the peons all excited over things they shouldn’t be thinking about.  Would you really give a crap if you lived under a king that protected the border?

And unless Kyle Rittenhouse shows up in Milwaukee, there will be no grass-roots riot when the Regime nominates the GOP “candidate” this summer. They may as well bring back the “smoke-filled room” process. At least it had no pretense of democracy.

Interesting thought.  I’d forgotten that once upon a time—not so long ago—you had no ability to choose candidates in primaries.  The parties gave you a (supposed) choice between two (vetted) candidates.
Wonder how that affected elections and outcomes.  Of course, we were a more White ethnic nation then.

        this is a random thought but is it possible that DR3 in an ironic way is actually something that might trigger the leftists racism terrain warning system? Like I would go on dailykos and try to figure out what they were thinking. Typically saying black on black crime was not something you could even talk about because by simply arguing about it, you were outing yourself and it was assumed you were engaging in “pre-crime”.Is it possible, DR3 will eventually have that same effect? Someone should do an etymology deep dive on the origins of DR3 and how maybe it started as a bad faith troll and maybe eventually became sincerely believed.

            Libertarian influence. You can nerdily “notice” any numerable thing, but you can never do anything about it. Only THE MARKET can—but never does—via an accumulation of invisible mysteries of noninterference.By “libertarian” I don’t mean philosophical libertarianism, which in theory might have any opinion about any racial matter because it’s not a racial philosophy (though only one race supports it at all). I mean what actual libertarians actually are: highly partisan establishmentarian Democrats.DR3’s job is to disarm the right/people, not the left/state. It’s self-hypnosis against race-related activity, from massive state action down to private thought.If THE MARKET rejected DEI (or whatever), we’d see it. The people would refuse to buy from the companies that sell it. But *you* wouldn’t. *They’re* the racists.

        I’m sure the regime would like a riot at the R convention. Would go a long way in supporting the narrative they are pushing. The odds of this happening without (many) agent provocateurs are zero. We all know republicans and white people don’t riot. But they’ve pulled it off once already (J6).I’ve been saying that from my perspective it looks like the fix is in for Haley in NH and probably SC too. An attempt to take the wind out of the Orange sails right at the outset (there’s no hope for Iowa, you can’t rig a caucus). Some recent NH polls showing Haley gaining 20 points in under 3 weeks support this view. Not all the pollsters are on board with this, some still show the big Orange lead, but as long as there a couple of polls that show Haley in striking distance, which there now are, then they can pretend it wasn’t so implausible.Not that this is their only plan for cleansing the Orange from the ballot, nor is it foolproof, but they’d rather go with the relatively innocuous measures first in the hopes that they work, before they have to resort to the more drastic ones. Make no mistake, come November there will be no Orange on the ballot.

            And there will be no Republican Party after November. The stay-at-homes and malicious burn it all down votes will probably make for Dem supermajorities.

        “What goes unnoticed in all of this is the collapse of the GOP.”It is the main event this year. The handful of Republican voters who remain convinced they support a legitimate political party is infinitesimal. You probably notice that fewer and fewer people ask why “their” Congress sold them out. It is, as you point out, very reminiscent of the end stage of the Soviet Union–everything is a lie, and all political activity is based on that knowledge (for the record, I don’t think the batshit Regime now in charge will allow for a resolution as peaceful as the death of the USSR).I’m no longer completely convinced Trump will be yanked. Things may be too bad to risk the meltdown. I change opinion on this daily. If the Republican Party does remove Trump from the ballot, it probably will be with the agreement the Democrats sack Biden at the convention. This will allow the parties to do a “both sides” sort of justification. Nikki Haley is a wonderful exemplar of the absolute decrepitude of the United States, so they likely will go with her if the trigger is pulled on Trump literally or figuratively. Either way, this not only will mark the death of the Republican Party regardless of how Trump is handled, but also will make for a good marker as to when the official end of the GAE began.

        Ranking the performance of the candidates:1. Nikki Haley:  Haley owned the stage. Compare Nikki Haley with other contenders, and she comes across like a class-A national politician. The theories on global warming were deeply, deeply depressing. She tried repeatedly to focus the spotlight on Trump and his presidential failures. She had a few good moments criticizing Trump. Haley cane out as the more principled adult in the room. She seems uncomfortable with the G.O.P.2. Ron DeSantis: With just two candidates onstage, DeSantis got a lot more time and space in which to let his grating personality shine. A man this petty and cruel shouldn’t be anywhere near the Oval Office. He has no idea what normal people want. There were several moments late in the debate when DeSantis took on Trump directly.  Iowa must be getting tired of being reminded he visited all 99 counties.

Owning the stage is easier when no decent competitors are allowed. Why wasn’t Vivek there? Was Haley tired of the other Indian slapping her around?
“She seems uncomfortable with the G.O.P.”
Nah. She’s only uncomfortable with the GOP voters. They’re so white and icky, especially in Flyover Country.

            WTF is with you? You only show up after debated to fluff Nimrata never anywhere else. What’s your deal, are you a paid shill and if so, who pays you? And for that matter, how much?
If the money was right I’d make a fool of myself anomymously on the internet. I suppose I would but I’d probably have a major drinking problem to try and forgot how I was debasing myself.

            I’ll say this for Nimrata, she is the most masculine looking person from India I never seen.  The men are typically small, frail, and weak looking from the neck down.  From the neck up, they almost all look like circus freaks.
Nimrata, on the other hand, has a normal size body and a jaw that would put most boxers to shame.

Malnutrition from the day they’re born (probably even earlier in the womb). Plus the little they get to eat is carbs — rice, a bit of wheat, lentils. Just about no animal protein.

        The United States is entering the later Soviet Union phase of  its existence. Nobody believes in anything, the system is irreparably corrupt, the current balkanization makes the blue/gray divide look like a suburban neighbor dispute, and the economic madness of the last 50 years is circling like a vulture.Baring a black swan event (highly likely I think) we could be in for a gradual slow decline similar to the Soviets. Like them we won’t succumb to external threats, but from a rot within. Corruption, degeneracy, and losing our cultural identity. Since Americans like to do everything fast, it may not take 75 years like the USSR.It’s possible all, could be saved, but I wouldn’t bet my life on it.

        Elections may still be meaningful at the city council, school board, county board of supervisors, or state legislator level.  At the national level, participation is largely meaningless.  My personal hope is that Trump is not the Republican Party nominee, that MAGA voters refuse to vote for the nominee and Biden wins re-election in a 45 to 48 state blowout.  The Republican Party implodes and finally goes the way of the Whig Party in the 1850s.  (Unfortunately the end of the Whig Party was part of the events that led to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861.)I found that New Hamphire Attorney General letter almost unbelievable.  The Democratic Party has chosen to rig its nomination process by not letting New Hampshire go first with a presidential primary that actually results in delegate allocation.  Then the New Hampshire state government schedules a primary anyway.  When the national and state Democratic parties point out that they’re using a different mechanism to pick the New Hampshire’s delegates who will vote for Joe Biden, the state government claims that they’re suppressing voters!  Part of me hopes that state files charges, since Democratic prosecutors are filing specious and unjustified charges against Donald Trump.This “election season” is likely to be the most bitterly fought one ever; not even the 1860 election had this level of rancor.  Mail-in ballots will deliver the outcome desired by the ruling elite.  As dissidents this is probably to our advantage.  We have no stake in the outcome at the national level and the more illegitimate the proess becomes, the better.

            Trump’s election was the first case where the citizen’s turned voting into a mockery, electing the most obnoxious guy they could find to give the middle finger to Washington D.C. I say that as a good thing.
Trump being on the ballot again forces the regime to throw the table and admit elections are useless, basically forcing the regime to agree with voters who mocked it, while simultaneously talking about how sacred it is.

                Despite Trump’s obvious flaws, he’s still the best the regime has to offer.  Trump may be crass and obnoxious, but he doesn’t hate us. AFAIK, he is not sacrificing children to a volcano god, which is more than the rest of them can say.  Every other one of them would gladly have your daughter’s breasts removed and your son’s penis removed.

        The Republican Party has been extinct for a long time. I look back on the “presidential” candidates in primaries during my lifetime (McCain? W? Gary Bauer??) and cringe at the thought that we took any of it seriously at the time.Trump gave it the coup de grace in 2016, when he exposed just how deep the phoniness ran, with ALL of 17 primary candidates (advertised as the Best Field Evah!) bought and paid for by the open borders lobby, who were only interested in doing its bidding. Trump did another thing too: he gave the average  R voter the license to express, or perhaps to realize, just how much we had always *hated* the party establishment. The latter have never forgiven us for rejecting them, in favor of the crude man with the golden toilet.Mind you, the D party, as a political party, is dead too: the shambling, remote-controlled Biden truly is its perfect avatar. But as a vessel for resentment, theft, and Satanism it can still inspire loyalty from a lot of people who would otherwise hate and exterminate each other.As America’s political dinosaurs lumber heedlessly to extinction, we’re waiting for the New Thing to emerge—hopefully without a meteor strike interceding (although it’s getting harder to see how else to clear the deck of the current dominating species). Until that happens, the “competition” between Oviraptor and Gorgosaurus, whether in the late Cretaceous or modern Iowa, is pretty meaningless.

            I first started paying attention in 1996 as I was about to reach voting age.  I looked at who was running in the Republican primary and thought “these are the choices we have?”  That reaction has only intensified in the years since then and spreads across all levels of government.

        Here in Branch Covidia (a portion of a state that borders New Hampshire) where masking is still required at numerous events and the latest booster at a few of them, there’s a move to keep Trump off the ballot. The initiative, picking up speed, began in my town.The town ‘s permanent residents are 92% white. 30% of the school personnel are persons of color and the town is concerned about the continuing, systemic underrepresentation of persons of color in town employment though that’s slowly being remedied by a 50% of color selectboard.These are decent people except for one recent incident where three school personnel, one of whom is Black and is suing the town for racial discrimination, were fired for misgendering a few students at the middle school, upwards of 40% of teens in town, according to a recent town poll, now identifying as non-binary or trans.“Palestine Free From Las Vegas To The Sea’ is picking up speed and the Jewish community is alarmed.If this sounds like an exaggeration, be warned that Trump will not be President because we say so. At least be clear on that much.

        Way ahead of you. I can’t seem to muster any interest at all in the election. I had no idea that there was a debate, and I forgot that Iowa was getting close.
Personally, I rooting for Trump to get thrown off the ballot, which will piss off a lot of people, and then Trump continues to run, which will undermine the legitimacy of the system.
I want the whole thing to be a clown show, top to bottom. The more ridiculous, the better.

            To further complicate the Iowa caucuses the upper Midwest is going into a cold snap this weekend.  The forecast high in Des Moines on Monday is -2.  The northwest corner of the state, where I would expect DeSantis to get his highest levels of support will be even colder. The idiotically run Iowa caucuses require voters to show up in person on Election night and sit and listen while people drone on about why they support each candidate.  This could be record low turnout.

            Well said good sir.  I’m in the exact same boat.  I don’t watch or follow any of it.  I try to live life in my bubble.  My only desire for a Trump miracle win is so everything comes crashing down in reaction to it.  The faster these “United States” collapse and dissolve, the better we will be and the better the world will be.  The more likely scenario is things will play out like you describe.  Will it be enough to convince normie that voting is for retards?  I doubt it…My parents are in their late 70s, and my mother just can’t break herself of her belief in the system.  She’s frustrated of course but she can’t shake herself of this belief that by not voting we will just “let them win”.  The stranglehold this false belief has on people is truly remarkable.  I have friends my age who are exactly the same.  They cannot comprehend it, truly amazing.

                Lineman:  It’s really hard to get people who live in pockets of heritage America to understand how rare they now are and just how bad it is elsewhere.  I try to explain to my neighbors, or the helpful pharmacist, or store manager, how different life is where we now live and they listen, and nod, but I can tell they truly cannot conceive of the reality we escaped from – where almost no one was a native English speaker, where the schools were down to 20% White, where getting anything done meant paying a diversity tax in inefficiency, wasted time, hostility, incompetency, anad general stupidity.  How can they imagine that when life here has never been that way?  Not for them or anyone else they know?I said “excuse me, Sir” to the older White man with a large gray beard who was stocking produce at Walmart yesterday.  He started teasing me, responding that I should just tell him to get the heck out of the way.  I laughingly explained that I did that in DFW because I was angry all the time.  Not here – I am friendly, smiling, courteous, and perfectly safe to take out in public.It’s truly a different world, and in some way I wish I could protect these people from what is coming.  At the same time, of course, I want to force them to recognize how rare and precious this type of community is, so that they would be motivated to take active steps to protect it.  But I bite my lip hard and monitor my speech.  It’s a very fine balance.

I understand the desire to deny legitimacy by not voting.  The problem is that we are not in a closed system or a closed society.   The hundreds of millions of worldwide citizens that want to be here will make the  whole thing moot.

                        I think we’ve already seen about what their max capacity for bringing in illegal aliens is. If they could be bringing in more they would. Between now and the end of a second Biden (or Haley) term I don’t think they can do much better than about 20 million.
I figure that the “encounter” numbers are pretty close to the real number, since IAs have every incentive now to turn themselves in to “border patrol” and no incentive to run.

                        Jeffrey, how many IA’s do you need to bring in?
As near as I can tell, we are adding perhaps 1% to the national population numbers *per year*!  That without legal immigrant numbers which I believe is set at 1.5M!
IA’s and RA’s, when inevitably legalized, can sponsor others under the Family Reunification Act, and of course simply produce new citizens (kids).
All in all, it seems we are screwed as the numbers far exceed growth in native population births.  And of course, the Boomers (mostly White) will add negatively until we are gone in the next 20 years.

                        mikew:  Do you honestly think ‘controlling’ the flow, let alone closing the border, will make any difference at this point?  For the love of God, consider the numbers at this point.  Demographically it doesn’t matter if we get another 15-20 million aliens – we’ve already got at least 80 million here.Hell, we let in over 1.5 milion ‘legally’ every year, and 99.9% of them ar brown, black,  or yellow.  Their children and grandchildren – regardless of the ‘status’ of their parents – get magic-dirt birthright citizenship. I was a damned consular officer; I understand how the stupid system works – and it’s exactly as the string pullers intend it to.It’s TOO LATE.  The under 18 population in AINO is less than 50% White, and dropping more every year.  Yes, I understand the concept of ‘first plug the leak,’ but this boat is already swamped.  Face numerical and demographic reality.  It’s going to take war of various types, and lots of killing and death, for your progeny to have any hope of ever living in a White country.

                        Considering the COINTELPRO practiced against our politicians, which was much in evidence way back when I walked the hallowed halls, that is the only sane option for a dissident. Most pols will easily succumb to the regular moral suasion, bribery and blackmail, but those who won’t (or can’t) might as well check themselves into a Soviet psychiatric ward.

                        You’re right. And we must also build communities for mutual support. This can be as informal as groups of homesteaders or cooperative homeschoolers, or as formal as the purchase of one of the many abandoned churches in a small town and creating our own Oranias (existing residents would be more accepting of us than a group of Somalis, and the religious angle may provide some right of association). Grittier dissidents can set up well-fortified businesses in urban areas if necessary (their absence from online BIPOC registries could become a precondition for our custom).

            Acceleration baby. Don’t vote, and the only engagement you should have is with normies or regime puppets on Twitter. My hope is that voter turnout is low on the Right, and that Democrats sweep offices. Then the Dems think that they have a great mandate, and the GOP is left wondering why it exists. The GAE crumbles and more and more normal people start seeing what we dissidents see.

                Maybe counter-intuitive, maybe not.  A demise of the GOP will lead to a quicker demise of the Dems because the only thing holding them together is opposition to the GOP.  Without it, the Dems scatter to the winds like a broken centrifuge.

        “The right answer may be to deny them the thing they desire most, which is your consent.” Ain’t no “may be” about it — it is the absolute right answer, the only option a reasonable man has. I haven’t voted since the Republican presidential primary of 2008. I harbor no illusions that my nonparticipation has any more impact on the machinations of our rulers than my participation would. However, at least I know I’m not a sap. It’s psychologically advantageous, you see. I watch the rest of this species and wonder how they can sustain their exceedingly naive delusions.As this farce of an election draws nearer, I will do my best to drop out. That means I’ll probably have to stop reading Zman, which is unfortunate, because he’s a great writer who consistently produces thought-provoking analysis. I suspect that his talents might be better spent focused elsewhere. But that’s only my own speculation. Don’t pay it too much mind.

        What follows is possibly equal measures of hopium  and copium. Our esteemed blog host is entirely correct when he says it’s all kabuki theatre…it is, for now at least.No one is more shocked than I am about this either…but us Canadians may be ahead of you Yanks on this stalemate with Clown World. Out of nowhere, our conservatives grew a spine and now they are finally actively attacking the liberals and opposing them. Justine Turdo refuses to show up in the House of Commons because gets savaged and mauled by Pierre polliviere who heads the Conservative Party. “Smol PP”, as we like to call him. The heat is so bad, that Turdo is taking multiple extended vacations because if he shows his face in public in Canada – he gets mobbed. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone doesn’t take a shot at him or throws a bomb at him.Here in Alberta our premier (a woman, of all the bloody things) – has told Turdo and Ottawa to shove their gun laws, shove their carbon taxes, and flat out refusing to go along with any aspect of the shitlib agenda. Saskatchewan is in the same boat. None of us can live like this. Even the more sensible libs are getting fed up.I think things are close to where they are so bad, these moronic leftist govts are going to start to fall. The fake conservatives are going to go the way of the buffalo too. It has to…these clowns are bad for business…and as we all know, money talks…

        I’m curious to see what really happens if and when Trump is ACTUALLY removed from the ballot via whatever BS excuse they come up with.  So far it’s been a lot of talk and court filings here and there, but mostly a tempest in a teapot as far as I can see.  If he blows out Iowa and some of the early primaries, will the coalition government simply produce the big middle finger?  I have to believe they’re at least somewhat wary of that strategy, but perhaps like your average stupid jogger, their hubris overwhelms reality and logic.  If no significant pushback is forthcoming in that scenario, into the abyss we go – probably will anyway – keep your heads down…

            Outside of assassination, the window to take Trump out is closed. There needed to be FAR more momentum in the court cases and ballot removal and they haven’t delivered. The zombies have to have their debate simply because that’s what you do and to not have them would basically concede Trump is the nominee.A bold party would just make Trump the candidate and dare D.C. to stop them, but, like Z says, they are completely part of the regime. If they can’t remove Trump, leadership will subtly try to sabotage him and fail, because they’re losers and losing is the oly thing they do well, up to and including losing control of their own party.

Completely agree. We are days away from the first delegates being selected. The time to disqualify Trump was a year or more ago.
As I see it, the regime only has 3 options left to stop Trump:1. They kill him2. SCOTUS rules Trump ineligible3. They fortify the election in November so hard Pedo Peter gets over 100 million “votes”.
Of those 3 options, I think #3 is the most likely one.

        Beautifully written essay and couldn’t agree more. Just wanted to add an aside to this:
“If you drop out of the system, then they cannot manufacture your consent.”
They can manufacture consent for those who’ve dropped out. They can’t for those who actively resist and don’t play by the rules of a rigged game. Gandhi’s non-violent protests had zero impact. What made a difference was firebrands like Subash Chandra Bose. White dissidents can learn from the liberation struggles of other oppressed people.

        I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: The “buzz” around Nikki Haley reminds me of the gal that wants to find a boyfriend. The GOP is her cute friend that wants to fix her up with you who keeps telling you how funny and smart and nice she is. You wonder “So, if she’s all that, why doesn’t she have a boyfriend?”

        Regarding tuning and dropping out I wonder if the decline in male enrollment in college admissions will show at the voting booth also.  A rule by diverse harpies may take hold more often to the point of ludicrous outcomes as it has recently in St. Paul.
Of course the first piece of business for the good people of St. Paul is voting their feelings on the Gaza/Israel conflict.

            Not voting, while it makes sense from a practical perspective, is not going to have as much impact as other forms of dropping out.
No. 1 – dropping out of the economy (that one really hurts them) – cut your spending, in particular those unnecessary items tied to regime psychophants
No.2 – for those eligible, eschew military service (that seems to be working – at least they are noticing).
No. 3 – to the extent you can get away with it, give 50% effort for anything regime related.  Unproductivity is our greatest weapon.

            I had no idea, until reading this essay, that King Cobra was excluded.  He’s definitely getting the Tulsi treatment.
It’s kind of pathetic seeing RFK Jr and King Cobra keeping at it, though. They have literally no chance. I admire their spirit, but no one’s going to take over the system by debating or speechifying or viral video-making. No matter how based they are.

        According to the New Hampshire AG, telling voters that voting is meaningless is now a crime.

You will vote.  You will vote for who we tell you.  And if you somehow evade voting, we will vote in your behalf.

I’m quite sure after having left Silly-nois nearly seven years ago I am now voting Democratic in either Du Page or Will County elections. 😉

Either? I fear you’re not giving them enough credit. More likely, you’re voting Democratic in both…and will continue to do so long after you’re dead.

                    Sadly I’m sure my late father, gone from us these many decades, has been voting Democratic from his Cook County gravesite against his expressed will while alive.
As have the rest of my family in the same cemetery. 😒

                        When my mother died, we heard from social security within 48 hours and from there every agency was notified and yet she still got called for jury duty last month.  And that appears to be the norm you have to go take them off yourself.

                Where I live you can check online if you’re registered, which party’s primary you can vote in, and whether you voted in the last few elections. The government exposed this data to facilitate individually targeted “your neighbors know you don’t vote (or who you vote for—so maybe you better not)” mail and text-message campaigns by the local Democrats.
I’ve never even considered voting, but officially I’m one of the Democrats’ most reliable supporters. Maybe it’ll get me taken off a list.

            The regime has still lost the public faith in the institution.  If the regime wants to spend whatever time it has left playing make believe with elections like some aging starlet in her darkened mansion trying to apply lipstick with shaky geriatric hands and missing her lips…it’s not like it makes a difference ultimately.

                The same people that want to fine you for not voting are the same people who say that it is it much to get an ID or go in person to your local precenct. They say voting is important but they don’t exactly lead by example.

            So, two people wrote a letter to the NH Dem Party chair, telling him that the primary on 1/23 will in effect be meaningless, because the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the entire DNC itself has already determined that this vote will not be binding regarding delegates. Any normal adult would conclude that indeed this primary vote means next to nothing if it doesn’t even determine delegates. In comes the NH DoJ, paying some noxious attorney on staff to write a threatening cease and desist letter to these private citizens, accusing them of felony voter suppression. They really don’t want RFK Jr. to get a scintilla of support, and they especially don’t want the dirt people to know a dog and pony show when they see one. You will vote and you will like it. Even if your vote doesn’t count.

            Completely at odds with the 1sr Amendment, but who’s gonna say that, SCOTUS?  No.  Anyway, this is little more than a SLAPP suit (or threat).  The little guy has no resources to fight it.  The big guy has too much to lose.
