        Remember that episode of Northern Exposure where Shelley accidentally breaks a bottle of wine worth thousands for a big party Maurice is having? And Eve helps her fix the bottle and re-fill it with a concoction of odds and ends and everyone is fooled and enjoys it with all that nonsense about notes of pears and apricots and all that carp.
That, in a nutshell, is modern wine connoisseurship to me.

        P.S. I lie about decent bourbon starting at $25: Wild Turkey 101 is under $20 in some markets, and it’s sound stuff.

        @thezmanAh, a wheat guy. I favor rye, but I’ll enjoy the hell out KC and MM if that’s what there is.In a restaurant, I ask the waiter what the chef recommends with the dish. Never yet regretted it. I guess that proves either that chefs know what they’re doing, or that any random wine is fine with anything. I’m good either way!Anyhow, if the waiter went to the trouble of remembering that stuff, may as well let ’em have somebody appreciate the effort.I’ve heard recently that Sam Adams has gone downhill, and hoped it wasn’t true. I recall drinking a fair amount of Harpoon IPA too, when I lived in Cambridge.

        Nothing-special swill at astonishing fraudulent prices, from a guy who knows all the buzz-sounding words to say?Let’s talk about mutual funds, appliance/automotive replacement parts, and “certain” so called “news” outlets and “comedy” shows, and “official” spokes folks.

        @fodderwing  nails it. Where I live, you’ll occasionally find something good as low as $6. $8-$15 is the sweet spot, give or take.Decent bourbon starts at $25 and diminishing returns start to kick in immediately. For $50 you might get a better whiskey, but nothing like twice as good. For $100, probably as likely worse as better — but I’ll never have that kind of money to waste enriching scam artists, so I’ll never know.There’s a price range that pays for some real craftsmanship, and a lot of the customers have some taste but hate getting ripped off. That’s where the quality is.Same thing with beer now. Bud is crap, but anything that costs more than Sierra Nevada IPA is likely to be grotesque overhopped novelty crap. I’d rather drink watery old Bud.

            I’ve never been much of a wine drinker, so I order the house table wine at dinner. If that’s not available, I’ll get a cheap cab. I’ve never cared for white wine so I stick with a basic red.With beer, I have some odd ball tastes. I like Sam Adams, Sierra Nevada and others in that class. The boutique stuff does nothing for me. That said, I can slug down High Life if it is free and I want to get drunk.Now, Bourbons are a different story. I like Knob Creek and I like Makers Mark. I’ve tried a lot of different bourbons and I keep coming back to those two.

        I sure am no wine connoisseur, but in my modest experience wine tastes only as good as the food it is served with and as delectable as the company one dines with.

        Too bad you weren’t on the jury (if there was one). That would have been interesting.

        I have bought approximately four or five bottles of wine in my adulthood.  Boone’s Farm, 1957, El Paso, TX. Swartz Katz, 1962, Schweinfurt, West Germany, and Rosie O’Grady, 1970, Carthage, NC.  Just recently, I bought a bottle of cheap white wine for some receipt, and sthe left-overs were down the drain.  Rosie was probably the best.

        There’s more difference between a fifteen dollar bottle and a ten dollar bottle than you will find between the fifteen and one hundred.  Any more than fifteen and you’ve paid too much.

        Got introduced to wine in college in 1966. Wiederkehr’s Grape and popcorn in the dorm room of some friends of mine who shared my major. Fifty cents a bottle, I believe it was. Man. That was some good stuff.
All reds taste about the same to me. I have developed a taste for rieslings and such.
