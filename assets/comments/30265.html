        I’ve said this before:The big event of 2022 wasn’t Putin finally having enough of the ziocon shit, it was Xi’s visit to S.A.Recall that just a few weeks before Biden, or what passes as Biden, had arrived in Riyadh to beg for more oil, got an Uber from the airport and was greeted by a fist bump. His two hour meeting was attended by several other characters, none of any note, before he was told to piss off home empty handed.Xi Jinping however, had his plane escorted by Saudi Jets- I thought I counted seven, and upon landing was welcomed by a cannonade and a flypast of planes painting the sky in the colors of the Chinese flag. The Saudi King went to the airport to greet him; The king an old and infirm man who walks with a cane, not MBS. The three day visit mapped out the energy future for the World, the future of the Petro-Yuan and the death of the Dollar.Who knew that demonizing as a murderer the most influential player in the commodity that props up one’s hegemony and sending carny barkers like Blinken to upbraid him for insufficiently celebrating sodomy would have consequences?Xi got the welcome he did because the Saudi’s are going into partnership with the Chinese. The Chinese approach to International Affairs is Win-Win, a contrast with the US’s Because We Said So.Among the projects, one of many to develop the country away from oil production. Saudi Arabia has energy up the wazoo in the form of Solar as well as hydrocarbons so mega-watt guzzling server farms (And BitCoin Miners) are a great fit. The excess heat, of course, will be used in the desalination plants that Saudi needs. So this is a triple win- Saudi, China and the asshole Greens.MBS’s main concern is, I’m sure, avoiding being murdered by the Washington Filth. ( I’ve always thought that’s what the DC Baseball Team should be called).Here’s everything you need about the US economyThe US imports everything it needs on a day to day basis. It exports cardboard. (The Koch industries entry is because they own Georgia Pacific)The petrodollars got a decade at most. The US is fucked.

                Yup.
Plenty of info out there describing the challenges and failures of solar plants in desert environments.
They aren’t nearly the panacea the green lunatics want you to believe they are.

                China laughs, and sequesters even more of the rare earth metals market- because the Saudis can pay those higher prices, by giving them a discount on the oil.

        The European empires of the 19th century — the British, French, Belgian, Dutch, and to a lesser extent German — were pretty good at taking on primitive nonwhites in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific.But when they fought other whites in World Wars I and II, it turned out to be not quite as easy as shooting spear-chucking Zulus with rifles.With that little bit of history in mind, consider the fact that the American GloboHomoZio Empire hasn’t defeated a peer rival since 1945. And unlike the European whites of the 19th century, they haven’t been able to handle the Third World primitives in the intervening eight decades.If the Americans couldn’t decisively defeat the Vietnamese, the Iraqis and the Afghans, you’ve got to assume that they’re guaranteed to get their asses kicked — hard — if they’re ever stupid enough to engage Russia or China.Giving money to the IDF to shoot Palestinians throwing rocks at Jews is one thing, getting your aircraft carriers hit with Russian or Chinese hypersonic missiles is quite another.Most likely GloboHomoZio is too stupid and arrogant to understand this. “Pride goeth before a fall,” and GloboHomo’s been celebrating a lot of pride lately.

        We need to keep reminding ourselves that our rulers might have insane plans (like blocking out the sun to help Mother Gaia), live in an information bubble and not be able to win wars except against small countries like Libya and Serbia but they are great at expanding their power domestically.The ruling class gets setbacks every now and then like the Louisiana judge telling the Biden administration it can’t force censorship on social media but that is always a speed bump not a brick wall.Take a look at the mental wellbeing, demographics and political views of Gen Z, and you can see that the future belongs to the permanent government of the US not the heritage population.

        That video you linked was brutal.
Is there a good collection of war videos somewhere on net?
Youtube censors everything and last decade’s old go-to liveleak is long gone.   Some twitter videos are good, but they are to hard to track down unless one happens to cross my feed every now and again.

        The most important conflict, and one Russia has prepared badly for, is the internal one inevitable within the Regime. Elements within the Party want to replace Biden with Newsom, that has been amply telegraphed. However, Biden will not go, and just as importantly the crazies, weirdos, perverts, lunatics, and neocons given massive power will not go. These include but are not limited to: Buttgig as the head of the Alphabet lobby, Mayorkas as Open Borders enforcer, Garland as the Lavrenti Beria of the Regime, Blinken as Nuland’s errand boy (the way Bob Iger at Disney reports to basically Kathleen Kennedy and her Blackrock backers). They would be replaced by Newsom loyalists related to the Pelosi/Brown/Getty family triumvirate that has run California since the 1890s or so. They won’t go.Thus it is inevitable that they will seek active War with Russia with US forces directly in Ukraine, in Russia itself, and in Belarus fighting Russians to stay. Dreizen, Douglas MacGregor, and a lot of others have noted that what starts in Ukraine (like postponed elections to save democracy) ends up over here very quickly. Hunter Biden is now back in the White House, he is not exiled in some remote place outside the scope of the paps, like North Dakota or San Bernadino. He’s back making deals, and hence the discovery of a mountain of coke in the White House with hilarious memes of Hunter and Joe doing coke like Al Pacino in Scarface.A real hot war is the convenient excuse for a “national emergency” allowing the Biden Regime to rule for as long as it wants. And given the total lunacy and degeneracy of the Regime where Hunter is the sane, normal one, the desire is to rule forever. Just like arrests of opponents will not stop with Trump, so too will Covid rules and the lure of absolute, unchecked, degenerate power not go away by magic. Every two bit bureaucrat now decides in a way who lives or dies, and the entire apparatus of the Regime wants the senile figurehead with the crazies running things. So war it is.Power is the crack cocaine of bureaucrats. They always like Hunter want more.

        American air power IS its artillery system. It’s very precise and quite destructive.
But if Air power can’t be used, American ground artillery is just too small to make a difference in a prolonged engagement.
The million dollar question is if  American gloves came off, would the Russians (and China next) be able to shut down American air power?
Nobody knows.

            US Air power would require destroying Russian air fields, missile bases, radar systems and more deep inside Russia. So any use of US Air Power means lots and lots of US Raids on Russian defense systems indistinguishable from that preceding a nuclear attack.Russia would have to use it or lose it, with respect to launches of nuclear missiles. They don’t have a robust triad of boomer subs with nuclear missiles or much of a Strategic Air Command (which would in any case be destroyed by US Sorties).Neocons respond to this by “Putin would not dare, his generals would restrain him” made more powerful inside Washington by Prighozin’s stunt.

                Know guys who would know who’ll tell you the F22 is unbeatable.
Not said “unbeatable in the air”
One Russian hypersonic missile with a small yield tactical nuke over Ramstein Air Base, Germany pretty much ends that though.
The US never takes nukes off the table. Russia will be the same if they’re cornered.

                    Assuming “unbeatable,” the big question becomes how much damage can the F22 do to ground targets with the limited ordnance it is able to carry. Being primarily an air superiority fighter is not as relevant as it used to be in our new age where the Russians try to control airspace with SAMs instead of with fighters. So the F22 being better than other air superiority fighters is largely moot. Let’s say the F22 is immune to SAMs, but the bombers it would escort, to defend from enemy fighters that aren’t there, are not immune to SAMs.There are 183 F22s in service, none presently stationed in Europe according to what I read, although they can relocate. How much damage to ground targets can some fraction of that 183 do in the Ukrainian theater while avoiding damage to themselves? Of course nobody really knows the answer to that. What I’m getting at is, even if it is “unbeatable,” its limited ordnance payload and small numbers make it highly questionable if it is a decisive war winning weapon. And that’s in a best case scenario where the Russians can’t shoot it down.

        The die was cast when the GAE decided to pick a fight it couldn’t afford to lose… with Russia…. right on Russia’s border. I guess we’ve been over (and over) all the flawed assumptions and the misguided “intellectual” environment that led up to that, the GAE’s sense of invincibility and inevitability (going back to and stemming from the ’91 Gulf War/USSR collapse). The core religious belief in the GAE brain trust that “free” societies always win, and the GAE is “free” so it must win. No, really. Even assuming that is true, one would think that, circa 2021, when the jabs were mandated and objectors debanked, it might have occurred to someone that we weren’t the “free” society anymore. But I digress.That the goals weren’t worth the risks was never a consideration, since the risks were considered to be impossible to manifest. There were no risks. The sanctions were supposed to work. Russia was supposed to topple right then.So here we are, with neither side able to back down, for it would mean their ruin, and the negotiations well hopelessly poisoned. Leaving only one direction that things can go. To end on a positive note, the dangers of radioactive fallout are generally overstated.

            Perhaps the actual dangers of the fallout might be somewhat overhyped, but the dangers from a false flag exploitation of some sort of a “dirty” release are not. The US did send a “sniffer” plane to Europe, you know, just in case a false flag was greenlighted, and the propaganda needs to be vaulted.
Worst case, you might we might wind up getting the maximum test case concerning the dangers of radioactive fallout.

You could die.
You could burn or get very sick.
You could get cancer. Is why you want to wear a lead vest for certain medical / dental procedures.
How intense, how widespread? The poison is in the dose.
Try to tell the citizens, troops that the danger is overstated.

                    Nobody (at least not me) is saying that the stuff is good for you. What I am suggesting is that there may not be as much of it, and not as widespread, as seems to be commonly believed.

        “The American military system is not built for this sort of war.” – True!  The American military system reflects the culture of our country.  It’s about vapid, grotesque political grandstanding by some closeted homosexual Senator, followed by orders for some kind of “Shock-N’-Awe” from the President.  The “Shock-N’-Awe” is a nice display for high resolution TV’s where news-bimbos in pumps have a coffee clutch about it, then nothing……nothing to back it up….followed by a trillion dollars in opaque defense spending over 10 years…followed by a slow-motion withdrawal and on to the next event…

        A note about Kursk; despite the obviousness of the Kursk salient &amp; the very probable coming German offensive &amp; the Red Army’s prepared defenses in depth, the Germans still made very good penetration &amp; progress. Don’t forget the tip of the spear was the II SS Panzerkorps comprising the 1st Waffen SS Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, 2nd SS Division Das Reich, &amp; the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf. The Russians didn’t so much as stop the German advance as AH called it off himself due to the Anglo-American invasion of Sicily.The climatic armor clash took place around the small village of Prokhorovka. Forget where now but in my continuing study (&amp; vast library) of the Russo-German War 1941-45 &amp; the Eastern Front I read somewhere where a Russian tank commander was asked why so few pictures of the Kursk battle. His answer was that for every destroyed German tank there were about a dozen destroyed Russian tanks around it &amp; that was very bad for propaganda purposes.

            The northern part of the German attack was more or less stopped cold.  The southern part, as you noted, made significant progress and achieved at least a draw at the battle of Prokhorovka.  Field Marshall Manstein, commanding the southern part of the attack, was sufficiently encouraged that he wanted to renew the attack the next day.  As you also note, Hitler, who was never enthusiastic about the operation, called it off when the Allies landed in Sicily.  Even if Manstein’s forces had continued the advance, the Russians launched a very large attack aiming at the town of Orel, which collapsed the northern part of the German front.  Manstein’s advance would have made no difference and Hitler was justified in calling it off.  It was never a good plan to begin with.

            The Leibstandarte, Das Reich (formally the SS Verfugungstruppe) and the Totenkopf: the three original formations of the Waffen SS. The entry requirements for the Leibstandarte and Das Reich were very stringent – of course on both physical and racial grounds.By the time of the Kursk, the Waffen SS had undergone a large amount of organizational restructure, with many non-germanic personnel serving in many field formations that used to pride themselves on having the cream of the crop. Not sure how it affected the three original formations by ’43, but they sure were a force to be reckoned with in the early and middle stages of WWII.

Can you recommend a good book on the Eastern Front?
I read L3on D3gr3lle’s Eastern Front and appreciated it. Not sure about the accuracy of a politically motivated writer but enjoyed the narrative, anecdotal form with a soldier’s eye view.

        We have to remember that we are in the dark as much as the Russians are. .”Washington wants this war?” Who, in Washington? It can’t be Biden, he doesn’t know what he wants for lunch, and he can’t remember what he ate for breakfast. His team is a veritable freak show of vibrants and sexually depraved clowns. They all have as much or even less leadership acumen than Biden does. The smart play here, is (and always was) – to sit down and negotiate. Nor can any of this be attributed to an intelligence failure… there are any number of voices within and outside Washington  that must have advised against the Ukrainian adventure before it even began. Even the noted REMF fart catcher, General Milley – has come out against continuing this thing. At least – he did before he was silenced by his bosses.I challenge you, Z – and all the Dissidents: show me a scenario or alternate plane of existence where any of this makes sense? Consider: the Kraine is in ruins, and will not recover within our lifetimes. Germany is now deindustrialized. They are looking at a full blown depression. Fwance has erupted in rebellion, with vibrants and fwenchmen vying for control of the country. Germany, Fwance and Britain are one welfare check away from mass (but diverse and vibrant) revolt . Rat faced jews are bailing out of Europe in droves. Since the donor class is largely made up of jews… they don’t stand to benefit from what is going to happen either.America would be in the same boat but staves much of this off by printing money.  I am honestly wondering if these are the final days of Globohomo Inc. When the West finally topples… our trading partners are going down the crapper with us. Anti-semitism is now a hobby practiced by grillers and normies. True believers are goose stepping and throwing roman salutes and I actually saw some ANTIFAgs get beaten up on Blab.The only guys that might come out of this intact are… the Russians – and it will be a squeaker for them too if this nonsense goes seriously kinetic. Our leadership is now so pozzed and erratic from all the lunatics in our managerial class…that we have NO parallels in history. The Kursk battle was fought by determined white men waging a sensible war to win on both sides. In this battle, our guys are queers, perverts, jews, grifters and gangsters. If we actually WANTED to win this war… we would take part in it, put real warriors on the ground, with meaningful logistics to support them. Air and sea forces would be brought in and harmonized to maximum effect to counter Russia. Meaningful blockades and sanctions would go up… but the fighting is being left to a group of decimated Ukranian hillbillies.I don’t think even the tinfoil hats or the Dissidents are going to make sense of this goat rodeo. I sincerely hope I am wrong about it too.

            The plan makes sense to the neocons even to this day because, as the Z Man points out, they believe their own bad information.   You see the Russians are very close to a total collapse, according to the neocons.IMHO the war is not what will actually be the demise of the empire.   The neocons with their sanctions are what is doing them in.   Most of the world sees the U.S. system as now unreliable and  many countries do not want to be dependent on it.  So the BRICS movement is gaining all the time.   They are moving toward conducting business in other currencies.  In time the BRICS countries, or most of them,   will forge their own security alliance as well.   It will be far more encompassing than the Warsaw Pact.  JMHO.

            Filthie –“If we actually WANTED to win this war… we would take part in it, put real warriors on the ground’I could be totally wrong but just a hunch I don’t think the U.S. would come out well in the type of combined arms engagement that a U.S. vs Russia face off would be. U.S. infantry has never been particularly aggressive, SOP seems to be once encountering resistance fall back &amp; call in arty &amp; air support to minimize casualties. For the last 20yrs+ we’ve been fighting goat herders &amp; can’t even defeat them. Focus – ever since the Soviet implosion- seems to have been on small unit actions that take place in all the neocon brush wars. A peer-to-peer situation think would be a whole different story with potential for tragic results no one is prepared for.

            The money angle (bailing out others) makes sense if you are aware that dollars will soon be useless and one is trying to buy up assets for fiat dollars before ushering in a new global currency. The destruction of Western Civilization makes sense if you are part of a global cabal trying to get rid of national borders, usher in a worldwide crisis, and institute a one world, authoritarian government. And the evilness of this plan, and its inevitable success, makes sense if you believe in Satan. Just my two cents.

                    CBDCs would be programmable, which would allow central planners to endlessly control and manipulate the currency and therefore the population. That is the real goal behind them.Imagine having dollars that expired after a certain time, or decayed in value along a logarithmic curve, or could only be spent on certain types of goods and not others, or shrank in inverse proportion to your carbon footprint. Imagine prices that continuously varied by micro-cents based on instantaneous demand, or were discounted for approved minorities. Imagine the whole task of calculating all this stuff placed in the hands of the new Woke AI.This dystopian nightmare is what the overlords really want. This will be the end of Western money. Obviously, any money that cannot function as a stable andimpersonalstore of value is no longer money any longer, it is “social credit,” the perfect expression of the woke will to power.

                    Several reasons. Electronic means like only authorized, monitored transactions can be made. Just like public transit or self driving: only authorized movements allowed. Two, strengthens a single, global leviathan. Three, helps erode national identity further. To be clear, I do not think the currency will be better for the average prole. I actually think it will be worse.

        The inability to read the enemy seems to be a pretty universal problem.  But Putin’s failure to anticipate the reaction of the US and by extension, NATO, to the invasion is pretty dramatic. The US was telegraphing its intentions for months before the SMO started. Hitler’s failure to anticipate the US’s willingness to turn all of its economic might to the war effort was astonishing given it was happening early on in the war with lend lease.  How WW1 even got started is a convoluted mess of missteps.  Afghanistan could have avoided a 20 year occupation by simply handing over Bin Laden. The US probably thought the Viet Cong were going to be a walkover.

            It’s wishful thinking.  The types of ambitious people that rise to the top of the hierarchy are the sorts of people that act assuming the best scenario will unfold.  They’re at the top because they got lucky so far, but once they’re at the top they tend to assume it was all via superior ability and their shit no longer stinks.  What’s entertaining is when their luck runs out and they flail around, never quite realizing that they weren’t God’s gift to the world after all.  Reading Hitler’s biography it really struck me how lucky he was, right up to the point where he wasn’t.

                Pearl Harbor was the trap to drag Hitler in; Germany declared war four days after Pearl.
Germany was obligated under Axis treaty, they didn’t pull some “secret treaty” out of their ass as an excuse.
That trap was part, only part, of the reason the U.S. got “involved” against Japan.  The neocon criminal network was deeply vested in Asia for a century, but global empire was always on their mind.

                    The only sense it makes was it allowed Hitler to order US ships sunk.  The US was illegally arming both the British and the Soviets. They broke further neutrality laws by putting the stuff on US ships.  The recognized international law for neutral nations was payment in gold “cash and carry” (no credit) on the other country’s ships. So Britain could send ships full of gold to go buy US war materials, pay for the materials with that gold and then ship it back to Britain on that ship.I guess Hitler didn’t want to sink those ships before declaring war.AFAIK, the Axis Powers didn’t closely coordinate anything. Hitler was probably more surprised by Pearl Harbor than FDR who knew it was coming.

                    Quite right, as we’re finding out to our grief.
It’s my thought that Hitler was always the primary target; provoking Japan was a way to provoke Germany, to pull him in using “legal” means.
The obstinate Austrian had refused to kick the tripwire, over and over.
The neocon interests in Asia were related, and the Soviet eastern front, but I’d say Germany was the #1 threat to the internationalists.
Nobody had proposed a Kaufmann or Morgenthau total genocide of the Japanese; they weren’t Amelek, the ancient Aryan enemy.

                        Excellent point.  The Japanese probably would have dealt fairly with the US’s commercial interests in China.  The official line about Japan using Chinese forced conscripts to take over the world is just about as dumb as Hitler’s supposed world domination schemes, without a navy no less.

                I rather like the idea that this Putin is a body double.The conspiracy theory, relying on pictures of younger Putin and current Putin, is that the original was a deranged psychopath, a KGB killer.That was the one who pulled a hit job on his electoral rival and stole 129 million meant for relief supplies in St. Petersburg.Seeing how dangerous and ambitious he was, an offer was made to a lookalike, an accountant with an architectural bent in the KGB bureaucracy.Bad Putin was “retired” in the traditional Mafya manner, and good Putin was able to pursue his dream of building beautiful Orthodox churches…as well as put his accounting skills to good personal use.Well, that, and save Russia, as Martin Armstrong has it.

However deranged our neocons might be, why the mania about regime change in Russia or its desired breakup if the regime, under Putin, is as reasonable as it seems. Few American hearts, unless sufficiently propagandized, will break if the Donbass reverts to its Russian roots and Ukraine becomes a Polish corridor.The question may be relevant if our ruling class is bent as it seems to be on preserving our natural resources for our future Asian overlords. It may not only have been in Xanadu where Kublai Khan struck a 13th century deal with the eastern Slavic migration. A nice Russia would be preferable to a mean one when the Belt and Road begins to strangle the rump of Europe and the belly of North America. The neocons aren’t intentionally suicidal.

            Actually, the North was getting very tired of the war by 1863, as the Draft Riots in NYC confirmed, and if the South had adopted Stonewall’s (and Nathan Bedford Forrest’s) hit and run strategy, there probably would have been a peace…Indeed, it’s clear that General McClellan would have won in 1864 if the Army had not committed massive vote fraud in the border States, basically selecting the electors for Lincoln…And I disagree that Putin ever had a choice of suing for peace with the Ukraine, the tentative Istanbul treaty only occurred after the Russians virtually wiped out the UKR army in the Donbas..Medvedev and the military would have overruled that…But the war and the US sanctions have, in fact, been highly beneficial to Russia, diplomatically as well as militarily, as most of the world is disgusted with NATO’s behavior, and the sanctions have badly damaged both the dollar and the pound….Meanwhile, NATO is running out of munitions, and is much less of a threat…Finally, UKR is a small country, and is running out of cannon fodder, with perhaps half its population having fled…

                If Atlanta hadn’t fallen to Sherman in Sept 1864, then McClellan quite likely would have won in November. It was that union victory which signaled to the voters that they were winning, that the end in was in sight. Prior to that, to the man on the street, 1864 had appeared as just another year of carnage little different from the previous 2 or 3. This gets us to Davis’ fateful decision to replace Johnston with Hood, but that’s getting kinda OT.

        The citizenry of Russia, Ukraine, USA, and Europe are all opposed to this war and the senseless loss of life it has wrought (hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men have now been killed or seriously wounded). Zelensky was elected on a platform of negotiating peace with Russia, and Putin bent over backwards trying to get a diplomatic solution before hostilities were forced upon him. But it was a small cadre of politicians and neocons in the US and UK that drove this debacle inexorably into a hot conflict.Why did they do this? Two reasons. The first is that Ukraine was/is a piggy bank for grift on a monumental scale. Dozens (if not hundreds) of Western politicians were in on the take and sold their souls for a few shekels. It has been reported that many US senators had been bought for a little as $10,000, and many a relative was given a board seat on Burisma to “legitimize” the payoffs.The second reason is that the West has been coasting financially on the rape of Russian resources post collapse of the Soviet Union and more recently Ukrainian resources after Putin came to power. As an example, oil reserves in the Sea of Azoz rival US North Slope in size. Both the US and UK economies are utterly dependent on this rape in order to keep the plates spinning.The war in Ukraine is no longer existential for Russia, but it is for the USA, UK, and most likely EU as well. The bubble will burst after the 2024 election.

            Much like the North Slope, it would make almost no difference.  When the North Slope came online, it only slowed the decline of US production.  The US really won’t benefit much if at all from Ukrainian oil fields.The North Slope only lasted as long as it did because of the pipeline bottleneck.  The pipeline bottle-necked the whole thing at 2 million barrels a day.  If it is even still producing (I haven’t looked in 10 years), it cannot even keep the pipeline full (it couldn’t keep the pipeline full 10 years ago).Despite the uptick from 2010-202, the US has not been oil independent since the 60s or before.  But I would think Canadian oil is the far better option for the US. We used to import 3MB/D from Mexico, but that dried up.  Maybe we can Venezuela to start producing all their tarsands.  But at the rate we’re going, they might just ship it to China instead.

                A lot to unpack. First, only a small fraction of the North Slope oil fields have been drilled. Most of these areas are still off-limits. Second, the volume of oil still coming in from North Slope fields is still very high and its a good crude for refining purposes (versus heavy sour crudes from Venezuela which are costly to refine). Third, production near the Arctic Circle is expense versus domestic fracking derived oil, so economics are keeping a lid on expansion. Fourth, production from the Black Sea and Azoz will be much cheaper than North Sea supply, and would flood Europe in a heartbeat. And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to exploiting Ukrainian resources. Its much more that just crude oil and natural gas. Minerals and agricultural have enormous economic value in their own right; much of which is still untapped or under-performing.The EU is desperate for access and low cost supply across the board. But they prefer to steal it rather than pay fair market prices.

                    North Slope oil production is 500k barrels a day, a 1/4 of what it was in the 80s.The US does produce very light oil in the tight oil plays.  AFAIK, Canadian Syncrude sells at a premium. As of last year (the first headline of a google search), Candian Syncrude was selling at $15 premium over WTI.I agree that producing in the arctic is more expensive than at lower latitudes. But I was talking about the US, not Europe. Selling that oil to Europe is easy and for a higher price.   Oil generally sells for like 10 Dollars more a barrel in Europe (Brent vs WTI or Cushing). Today there is a $5 difference (76 vs 71). Plus shipping.  AFAIK, the North Sea peaked about 20 years ago from 6MBd to about 2 today.

        After watching France for the past few weeks, it seems essential for the survival of our White civilization to have alternate models to “liberal democracy”.Russia might not be as “good” as the West, but they don’t have an elite that hate their own people with every fibre of their being. That goes for a lot of the world and allows many second tier countries to compete with the West.So yes, NATO needs to be stopped. Hopefully this war wraps up soon. They might be piping mad if they fail though, and it does make you wonder what they will take out their anger on when they fail.

        This is off topic for today’s informative post, but it is in keeping with the snake theme. Back into the American Cold Civil War …When Kotkin showed up at the lectern and soon after the AmericanMind rotation, I was puzzled. It appeared as some joint anti-woke alliance. Now we find out that he fully endorses the woke project and is permitted to advocate it on their site:https://americanmind.org/salvo/the-luckiest-country/A post for Independence Day nonetheless. It is an aggregation of Barbara Lerner Spectre’s “multi-culturism is your future to survive”, and Krugman’s, “your power is going to go away”, diktats with a twist on the international food court promotion – Latino Industrial Country Music and 8 different Afro-AmerIndian-Asian ghettos in Nashville.So, I got my answer as to what he was doing there. He was the usual suspect’s ConInc bagman. Every time they show up. Every single time. This time, they are playing for keeps.

            &gt; This does not mean, as some on the Right may hope, a return to the old, whiter, less diverse America. Beyond the chaos of the Biden border policies, the country is made stronger by remaining the most immigrant friendly country in the world.The right are the true “diversity is our strength” vanguard.&gt; These newcomers are helping to make America both broadly both more cosmopolitan but also intrinsically American.This guy’s idea of America is a giant shopping mall.&gt; Joel Kotkin is a Washington Fellow at the Claremont Institute Center for the American Way of Life, the Presidential Fellow in Urban Futures at Chapman University, and Executive Director of the Urban Reform Institute.We’re almost at a point where such self-mas*rbatory titles result in most of society pointing and laughing. I can barely stop my eyes rolling to the back of my head when some guy in the podium spends five minutes going over all the accolades for the primary speaker.

                “This guy’s idea of America is a giant shopping mall.”
Yes. The Claremont’s stated aim is to preserve the American way of life. Little do we know the political double speak involved. To the rubes it means it means sovereignty, balance between commercial, religious, cultural, political pursuits. To the donors, it means America The Shopping Mall and Food Truck Lot.

            Guys like Kotkin and Michael Lind are the ones they send “over the wall” to hedge their bets by having a foot in both camps. Krauthammer was one of these (took me a long time to figure that out, I’m ashamed to say), as were the original neocons, for that matter. They come with money, which eventually leaves only corruption and controlled opposition in their wake.The great tell is that you won’t find many who are opposed to legal immigration. They may prattle on ineffectually about curbing the illegals, but they are almost universally ok with changing the the nation’s demographics, which is ball game.

        Iirc, Lee’s aim was Philadelphia. Confederate troops made it as far as York, near the Susquehanna River. The Wrightsville-Columbia bridge over the Susquehanna was burned to keep them from crossing into Lancaster County. The piles from that bridge are still there, I believe.Farther north are Carlisle (where the Army War College is), and Harrisburg. Harrisburg was a major rail hub and the site of a major Union training camp. That would’ve been the way to go to cripple the Union’s ability to make war. Gettysburg was as big a deal as it’s made out to be.The Confederacy never made it into LanCo, but according to family lore there was a detachment of Union troops stationed on the family farm (sitting on a hilltop as it does) for a time, tasked with watching for Confederate troops invading through Lebanon Valley. I get a kick out of imagining my great-great-great grandfather taking a break from harvesting wheat to shoot the shit with them, or my great-great-great grandmother bringing them a pie.Fwiw.

        Part of the issue is that the West’s foreign policy is lead by the neocons, whose skillset lies more in manipulation and narrative than actual conflict.The neocons seem pretty skilled in implementing color revolutions, where money flows to organizations and politicians, media is used to change public perception and voting shenanigans help to install the neocon’s preferred leadership.In essence, the neocons are really good at meddling in other people’s affairs and manipulating the system to cause trouble or install their man as the leader.But the neocons are truly awful as strategic planning. Once they move past the level of scheming, they are lost. They aren’t built to run the show. They’re built to manipulate the show for their own benefit.That said, I highly suspect that the neocons consider this whole affair a success. In their minds (remember, in their minds, not reality) Russia is weaker; Europe is even more tied to the West; the U.S. military budget will increase; NATO has enlarged and lots of Ukrainians and Russians are dead.

        The West is like the Confederacy, but also like the Germans, in underestimating the ability of the Russians/Soviets to mobilize men and resources.  Facilitating this war may be the worst, and most consequential, of the many mistakes our leaders have made in the past 60 years.

            Yeah, that’s the weird part. Sure, our military is geared for a different kind of war, but our military budget is still ten times the size of the Russian budget.You’d think that sheer size alone would give us an ability to at least keep up, not that I care.I’m assuming that our military would argue that if the U.S. was fighting the Russians, our superior weapons, air power and technology would make Russia’s artillery shell advantage mute. They’d argue that we’d wipe out their guns, transportation and power stations in a few days and that’d be the end of it.Let’s hope that we don’t find out.

            It is the elephant in the room. The Leopard tanks given to Ukraine were supposed to be the best of the West. They were useless in this offensive because they are not really designed for this sort of combat. I suspect the Pentagon is dragging its feet delivering Abrams tanks because they do not want pics of them in burning piles all over the internet.

                No tank is designed for that kind of abuse.  They can only operate in a combined arms environment with protection from the air, lurking infantry, and some suppression of enemy artillery.  The Ukes have none of those things, so their armor is slaughtered before reaching the first (of many) line of Russian defenses.

                The never ending propaganda that the next Wunderwaffe will be the key to victory is another striking parallel between this conflict and the German war effort after Stalingrad.  The piecemeal addition of insignificant numbers of western military hardware to a numerically inferior army with zero control of the sky is literally the complete opposite of a sensible military strategy.  At this point, a handful of F16’s will make as much difference to the outcome as the ME262 did in 1945.

            Imagine having an 800 billion dollar military budget and being unable to produce enough artillery shells for a ground war.Artillery shells aren’t “sexy” in the way that a multi-million dollar guided missile or multi-billion dollar jet fighter is. They aren’t sexy but they are necessary. But it’s a mature technology (I would figure advances in artillery shell design are incremental vs. sudden) so where’s the chance for kickbacks and graft slushing around? Tell some Congresscritter it’ll take 10 years and multi-millions, nay billions of dollars to build a new 155 MM shell and they’ll start wondering what the Hell is going on in the Ordnance Corps.Tell the same Congresscritter the XF-37/YF-37 Vaporware Multi-Role Fighter or XBGM-200 Imaginary Cruise Missile needs 10 years and multi-billions and it will be the Best Weapon Ever No We Mean It and they’ll sign on the old dotted line.As always, stuff that needs to be done isn’t as cool as new shiny stuff.

I suspect it gets attention because it is ultimately more profitable.  Old technology production goes to the lowest bidder, so research and development is the key to more and more profitability for the MIC.

        As an undergrad, I had a fairly brilliant professor who knew his European martial history forwards and backwards. One day I asked him, “Do you think that war profiteers literally get together and plan a war, like men with cigars in a backroom, like the old school Left depicts?” He smiled and said, “You don’t have to call the pigs to the trough. They know when it’s feeding time.”For the longest time I thought it was an oversimplification—a mix of Smedley Butler’s polemic “War is a Racket” and Marxist dialectical materialism—to say that rich men start wars to make money. What about intangibles like the metaphysical spirit, or the Christian argument that it’s a fallen world and war is a part of the human condition, like disease?I still don’t think war, in general, can only or primarily be explained as a racket, but this one, I think, can, at least in part. It’s too serendipitous that just after the spout got turned off in Afghanistan, the people in charge found this semi-permanent crisis. The “brain trust” responsible for this is as crazy and predominantly Jewish as the one that sold us Iraq, but did David Frum really convince anyone who mattered to go into Iraq? I don’t think they needed convincing.It’s this synergy between neurosis and greed that could push this one way past the point of no return. It already seems to have started some chain reaction that can’t be stopped, like u-238 getting bombed with neutrons (this reaction could be literal, as Zelensky has demonstrated an unhealthy fascination with the  Zaporizhzhia power plant.)This fanatical synergy obviously seemed to be driving the Covidians, too. Neuroticism about germs combined with a license to print money with this new schedule of boosters means they won’t stop unless forced. I wonder how much Old Testament laws about filth fed into the whole thing about masks and hand sanitizer and mountains of toilet paper in the first place? As if the ruling class’s fear of the unwashed masses took on a literal excessive hygiene/compulsive washing component. There’s also some overlap between the Abrahamic and New England Yankee fear of contamination and uncleanliness. I mean, “pure” is a buried cognate in Puritan.

            Wars are fought for economic ends — conquest of land and/or control of other resources (water, oil, rare earths). In that sense it is always a racket. But in the modern world, war has become an industrial undertaking. The military-industrial complex is a major chunk of USA’s faltering economy. The oligarchs behind this complex are the driving force in foreign and military policy. Politicians and think-tank intellectuals are merely their hired whores. And the ever-weakening US hold on the rest of the world depends on the mailed fist. So there is a constant will-to-war. The only way out is for the USA to collapse and to fracture into smaller polities. Otherwise this wounded tiger will continue on its path of destruction.

        One thing you’re making clear in your excellent essay is the mismatch in the quality of strategic thinking between the US (which hides behind the skirts of NATO) and Russia. Bluntly put, the neo-cons and their masters in the military-industrial complex simply cannot think strategically. Strategic thinking involves, inter alia,  patience, being geared towards the long-term, and having various contingency plans in place. It’s now becoming blatantly obvious that the USA is just lurching from one tactic to another and all of them are coming a cropper. The economic sanctions backfired and the battlefield tactics have failed. The latter have failed not only in the field but of not reducing the resolve and determination of the Russians to not be defeated. They’ve shown this historically time and again. The USA, on the other hand, has demonstrated that it can only handle quick victories. It is not geared psychologically or socially for protracted conflict, especially not for another half-assed military adventure aimed at fracturing and breaking Russia.In passing, Michael Hudson has an excellent essay at the Unz site on how the USA has just destroyed a great empire — namely itself.

            GAE got the intelligence on Russia so wrong that they probably had some “climate change” analysis being done (firing whoever told them things they didn’t want to hear).  Yes, incompetence was probably involved too, but still, I’d think that only explains part of it.

        “…never recover.”?
Pedantic quibble: after Gettysburg, the Southern United States had to fight for another two years before agreeing to a reconciliation with the North.  The South lost their farm equipment, but maintained their arms and ability to fight.
Reconstruction was but a blip in time.
More importantly, up until their 21st century colonization &amp; replacement, the South retained its distinct cultural and genetic homogeneity.
My children/ grandchildren/ great grandchildren will be fortunate to live as free as Southenors from 1865-2015.

        Re the chatter about a dirty bomb to the Zaporozhye nuclear plant by a desperate Zelensky, what made me perk up was this response on Simplicius’ substack:
“And if Zelensky/CIA/MI-6 did such a thing, how safe would the NATO meeting in Vilnius be?”
(Apparently, Kiev has about a week to show results, to pitch the summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.  We’re supposed to hold our breath waiting for the 3 a.m. sunrise for the next 5 days.)

        The original Russian plan almost worked. In March, 2022, Russian and Ukrainian diplomats in Istanbul initialed a ceasefire that would have implemented the Minsk Agreements and kept the Donbas in Ukraine. Ukraine would have recognized Russian sovereignty over Crimea.Immediately, the US sent Boris Johnson to Kiev to squelch the deal, and he did. The US will not tolerate a negotiated settlement to the war.So now Russia’s plans are different. Now they seek the elimination of the Kiev junta and the installation of a Russo-philic regime, the demilitarization of Ukraine, the elimination of the Nazis, and neutrality for the rump Ukrainian state. How much of Ukraine they will annex is uncertain, probably most of the ethnic Russian areas.This may take a while. A general European/North American war is still possible, and it would be nuclear.

        You didn’t mention the sabotage of the nuclear plant. Zelensky is laying down the lie that the Russians are going to destroy it which means the opposite. Then they can hopefully get Nato fully involved. Thoughts?

            Neocons hate being wrong, and are looking like fools right now. Their hatred for Russia multiplies after each loss or setback in Ukraine. They are irrational and will try anything at this point, so contaminating a large area of Europe with radiation is not out of the question. They hate Ukrainians as much as they hate Russians, so killing off large numbers of them are win/win for the neocons.

            I think what he is up to here is blackmailing the Europeans. They know the Russians are not going to blow up their own facility. He is using the threat of a nuclear disaster to force them to keep funding this war. My guess is the Kagan cult is the masterminds of this strategy.

                    I suspect the game here is to replicate what they did in Syria. They have placed American troops in Syria ostensibly to guard the oil field that Chevron is poaching as well as the farm land, but the real reason is to act as a trip wire. If they can get Poland and the Baltic states to send their troops into western Ukraine, then there is a good chance they get hit by the Russians. That will then trigger NATO to declare war on Russia. It is a crackpot plan, but these people are insane, in addition to be incompetnant.

                        I always figured that NATO would send in Polish troop to western Ukraine for “humanitarian” purposes if Russia ever started to getting the visible upper hand. The troops would ostensibly be to help with refugees or something like that, but would, in fact, be either tripwire or, at least, a force keeping Russia from crossing the river.Regardless, I can’t believe neutered the Germans and other Europeans have become. The Americans are telling the Ukrainians that they can get NATO troops on the ground if they can find a way to cause a nuclear power plant “accident.” The Americans are inviting the Ukrainians to send a cloud of nuclear radiation across Europe and the Europeans aren’t saying a thing.Unbelievable cucks.

                Andrei Martyanov (“smoothieX12” on blogspot and youtube, and most informatively was just a guest on The Duran) generally has the most informed take on all this, coupled with insider knowledge (being former Soviet military).
He points out that the nuclear plant has been shut down for a while now so this is an empty threat.
He also points out that from the Russian perspective this is not yet a war, and they haven’t even begun to really mobilize.

                    Martyanov is smart, but he’s not always correct. His schtick also gets hard to take after a while.The threat is not empty. The Ukes aren’t going to try and penetrate the ZPP containment vessel.They are either going to try and strike the less well protected nuclear waste stored at ZPP or they are going to load up a Tochka-U ballistic missile with waste from a plant under Uke control, then shoot it at ZPP to make it look like the Russians released nuclear contaminants.Both of these plans are still pretty dumb, but they are not empty threats. We are in a period of extreme danger for this false flag to go off between now and the end of the NATO summit.

            The ZNPP is pretty much shut down. So  Ukraine is said to be  planning to drop some nuclear waste in the aftermath of the attack to panic the West into thinking there is more radiation than would be caused by destroying the plant.
Then Lindsey Graham might get is wish for an all out NATO intervention.
