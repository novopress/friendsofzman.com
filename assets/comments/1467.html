        The reason they coupon and change prices is to attract more customers. I won’t buy cereal at 5 bucks a box so I buy the brand on sale for three. Other prople will pay five. They make money at five dollars and at three dollars but they get more volume with the sales. Nothing nefarious.

        Many retailers now tout “savings” off some MSRP but those MSRPs are bogey prices. Who, in their right mind, pays $5.99 for a “half-gallon (oops, now downsized to 1.5 quarts) of Breyer’s.Here’s an a related retailer angle: Ralph’s (Kroger) coupon system publishes only “cents off” coupons which do not mention the net price…ie “cents off” a bogey price. This prevents shoppers from making online price comparisons.Also, grocery retailers have manipulated consumers into joining a “Ralph’s Club” to get a lower price — a lower price than shown on the shelf marker which is, again, a bogey price. Imagine my disappointment upon learning that “Ralph’s Club”, like the Hair Club for Men, is not a real club.

        The next iteration will have to be the introduction of the “Galloon of Milk”, the “Doozen of Eggs” (11 per carton), the “24 oonce Sir Loyn” (what happened to all the mules?), and the “Fillay of flownder”.
