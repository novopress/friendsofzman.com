        “Both [Bermuda and Barbados] suffer from a lot of violent crime.”
I guess things have changed dramatically since I last visited there some 40+ years ago.  That’s disappointing….Paradise Lost, it seems.  Probably why I should savor the pleasant memories but never go back.

        I don’t think you can downplay the effects of decades of race baiting and class envy by the left. Obama and Holder have fostered racial hatred for political gain. That is an extremely dangerous game.I think the modifier is the church which is a cohesive force in the black community. Particularly in the South, it is a real force for good in the community.

        @Gob, Bahamas and Barbados both have populations of over 90% black. Both suffer from a lot of violent crime. Caribbean countries in general have a lot of violent crime.
Bermuda has a total population of ~64,000, around 54% black. In recent times violent crime has been increasing and race relations have become increasingly strained.

        “Nowhere on earth have blacks and non-blacks been able to live side-by-side in peace.”
Bermuda?  British West Indies (Bahamas?  Barbados?). Maybe the difference is the British heritage of respect for the law. Or maybe it’s because the names of these countries all start with the letter B—in other words, dumb luck.

        So, you’re talking a Coventry type of deal (the old SF novel)? Like Escape from LA/New York? Long as I’m not inside, it’s fine with me.

            I think three things would go a long way toward lessoning the problems of places like Ferguson. One is the cops have to live in the neighborhoods they police. It has been demonstrated time and again that this is the best form of policing. In black neighborhoods you get black cops supervising young males they have known since birth.Second, the jails in America need to be segregated. Prison gangs are a direct result of integrated prisons. Our rulers are clueless about the interplay between prison culture and street gang culture. It goes back to the 60’s when prison gangs like the Black Guerrilla Family got going. They quickly spilled over into street gangs and now control those street gangs from prison.That’s where the third piece comes in. The prison population needs to be in exile. You can be sure that loads of brothers in Ferguson have friends and relatives in jail who they see regularly. In many cities, it is hard to tell where the jail stops and the ghetto begins. Send the incarcerated gangsters to Alaska or an island prison system. No phones and no e-mail.In a place like Ferguson, 20-30 percent of the kids have a chance to make it into the middle-class. Another 20-30 percent can at least get out of the ghetto. Give that bunch a chance by removing as many problems as you can, while containing that violent, uncivilized element as best you can.

        Let them police themselves as the Feds let the Native Americans police their reservations.  The percentage of the black population in jail would likely rise as they begin to fully recognize who really does the damage to their own “society”.
