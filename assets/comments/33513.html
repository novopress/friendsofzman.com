        Yes, vaccines are a balance of risks. However few are actually informed about the risks. In fact, what RFK is arguing for is that people be informed of the risks. My wife and I informed ourselves of the risks and rewards of vaccinating our infant children. We were offered the standard battery. The most hilarious one was the hepatitis B vaccine. Our kids were only in danger of that if my wife had contracted hepatitis B. She had not, as she was not an IV drug user nor was she sexually promiscuous. If the risks of your infant contracting HepB are zero and the risks of your infant suffering complications from the vaccine are exceptionally small, the correct answer is to go with the zero risk option.Over a decade ago there was an attempt to conflate the rise of third world diseases in the US with the rise of “crunchy” moms who took issue with the vaccination schedule. The media joyfully blasted these women, most of whom lived in California, by pointing out that various diseases that had been wiped out in the first world and relegated to the third world were thriving in California. I wonder what other things that were relegated to the third world were also thriving in California (and continue to) and whether that’s the more relevant factor in the growth in these diseases.

        Mr Derb I think you are miss-informed concerning RFK, Jr.  He is very well qualified for the position of HHS secretary and has plenty of science related understanding.  Further, I would take the NY Post disapprobation of his nomination as a positive indication of his suitability.

        Derb has jumped the shark regarding modern science. He is sadly out of date and ill informed.3% chronic illness in children 1960 to 60% now. Just what the hell does he think happened? Also, risk in polio vaccine (or one of them) – sure – but now add the risk when adding 50 more vaccines to the mix. Every heard of the immune system, Derb? Next thing you’ll say is the covid fake vax was efficacious.

            One of RFKs critique of the healthcare system is that scientific journals have become corrupt via financial support by large corps.  Which ties into the reproducibility crisis that has accelerated over the last couple of generations.

        I’m so glad one of the head dissident right guys celebrates chinese new year. The DR’s inability to just have white children with white women is amazing. I can count on one hand the number of prominant thinkers in this thing of ours who *have*. We are doomed indeed.

        I think this article was a little too rough on RFK. He can get advisers and deputies that provide the science, but basic policies and mission are important. And much of the fight to make America healthier will be a legal and political one.

        Sad to say that my opinion of Derb just dropped at least 50%.
His attacks on RFK is standard boomercon trust of the system.  Quoting corporate media to support the attacks is beyond idiotic.
RFK has done tons of in depth analysis of his skepticism.  Boomercons midwife, like derb, ignore all of it and fall back to “herr derr vaxes are magic only an idiot denies it”.
Just sad.  Another hero bites the dust.

        “There were eight around the table: Dad, Mom, Son, Daughter, grandson, Son’s girlfriend, and an older couple we’ve known for years: yet another English native married to yet another Chinese lady. The unmarried received gifts of money from the married inhóngbāored envelopes,according to tradition.”
Notice they are following their wives’ traditions, despite living in the US.

        That’s a great 2023 video by Jared Taylor, about the push for DEI in the FAA. I checked it out, using the link provided in the transcript above. In 2014, the FAA ditched its old AT-SAT test (which measures aptitude and ability) when screening applicants to work as air traffic controllers, in favor of a standard-free, subjective test. In other words, they rigged the system.Like with DEI elsewhere, they have been lowering their standards in order to hire more Blacks and fewer Whites. It’s that blatant, as Taylor’s video proves. His conclusion as of November 2023:“There hasn’t been a fatal commercial airline accident in the US since 2009. We’re due for one. We’re due for a lot.”We will soon find out what caused the airliner crash in DC last Wednesday. Expect a lot of hysterical denials from the usual suspects, if it turns out DEI is the root cause.

        Thatcher derangement is still a thing, at least online. Every mention of her brings out some Millennial screaming about how their father or uncle or whatever was a coalminer who lost their job because of her. That’s a lot of coalminers.

                Did the Thatcherites have any suggestions for all of the working class people who lost their jobs?
My guess is that this was the beginning of the libertarian attitude of “let the unfit die.”
When I was younger, I was sympathetic to this outlook until I realized that the only ones who were going to be forced to die were white.
At best, libertarians were unwitting foot soldiers for anti-white forces.

                and how many miners and so forth are there now?  Thatcher just wanted them to stop holding the nation hostage with strikes.  Labour wanted their entire industries dead.  Britain is filled with lemmings in search of a convenient cliff.

                    Right. I have no idea why otherwise bright people forget the background of shutting down the open pit coal minesthat were no longer turning a profit,that is, these were not jobs, these were welfare.
Same as almost no one knows that the Tiananmen folferol was the students protesting that the government was shutting down government hiring. Those alleged freedom protesters could have obtained jobs elsewhere, but they wanted the sweet, sweet gig of living on the backs of others.
