        Thank you for covering this story with the seriousness and the perspective it deserves. I‚Äôve been reading autoadmit for more than 5 years and know the writer well. He was one of the most innocuous posters on the site and all the rhetoric attributed to Neff were threads made by other people that he simply commented in, usually with a benign joke. Tucker is going to get cancel cultured and thrown off the air, or fully neutered , before the election. It‚Äôs time for him to pick a side. He should spend the whole show bashing cancel culture, have his former writer on for an interview, and then dramatically resign and go to OANN.But the odds of him doing this are very low and he‚Äôs almost certainly going to throw him under the bus.this writer was Tucker‚Äôs top guy though and I consider him his brain.  Just like AOC was totally neutered after her chief of staff was fired (who was her brain), tucker is going to lose all the oomph that made him popular.

            posts like these zman reaffirm that my faith in your abilities is well placed.  This is a minor story that most others aren‚Äôt going to cover, but it‚Äôs a super important one.  The only thing I strongly disagree with you about is your support for Jeff sessions, who I consider a bumbling fool at best or a traitor at the level of Benedict Arnold at worst (and I lean toward the latter).

            A similar analogy could be made after DJT‚Äôs brain transplant, swapping  Bannon‚Äôs for Jared‚Äôs.Tucker will fold.  Old money always does.

            Even the stuff they dug up and quoted in the article was innocous if you read it carefully. I kept thinking, this the worst they could come up with several years of anoymous posting?? I really hope that Neff goes gonzo, but we will see. I suspect that carlson will fold like a cheap suit. maybe he will surprise me.

                It‚Äôs like the ‚Äúracist‚Äù nonsense they dug up on Ron Paul. A couple lame jokes in his newsletter about the ability of black teenagers to run holding a stolen TV. The bureaucrats in the so-called Libertarian Party were horrified, of course. Disgusting.

            Yeah also the revolution pretty much started in the 60s in Russia. It was the 1860s but it culminated in 1917 so we‚Äôre right on track

                Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron‚Äôs cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.C.S.

                    Cold blooded ice eyed calculators arrived after Stalin purges. From 1917-until 1938 we had also true believers. That is why we had madness and 50 million dead. Stalin purged idealists and replaced them with technocrats. This is the real reason, why mass murdering ended and why lot of Russians honoring Stalin despite his methods.

                    As someone who has been in almost that exact identical position- i.e. someone coming to seize my weapons because of racist district attorneys pushing racial politics into their search warrants, question for you‚Ä¶What SHOULD they have done? Gone out guns blazing with the army of cops that likely showed up to execute the warrant? It is incredibly easy to run your mouth until you have had the 4 am no-knock or even the day time regular knock with a dozen heavily armed men there to carry out a ‚Äòlawful order‚Äô.This is the part that always makes me laugh about the 2A LARPers. ‚ÄòOut of my cold dead hands!!11!‚Äù and you see them out at these COVID protests recently LARPing in full gear. The cops show up and in the next frame you see them on their knees cuffed and disarmed.The people in control aren‚Äôt stupid and they have all the time in the world. There will not, and was never, going to be mass door-to-door seizures. You do it quietly a few at a time over many years and one day people wake up and nobody has access to arms anymore. And furthermore, you have a population that is so cowed and fearful that if they even know youowna weapon, they will call the authorities and say your mere ownership ‚Äúmakes them feel unsafe‚Äù (this is the magic word now to destroy anyone for any reason). And you will be immediately stripped of that weapon under an ERPO (Red Flag) order.More clear now???

                                Vituperation is indicative of a small mind. At any rate, when one speaks of millions and millions of guns in private hands, and that number increasing constantly and at an ever increasing rate, your ‚Äúa few at a time‚Äù calculus won‚Äôt put a dent in the number. Moreover, how do your neighbors know you have guns? And how many of them would actually turn you in for possession? I‚Äôm afraid your breathless Chicken Little act bears no positive relationship to reality.

                        Thank you.  I‚Äôve been trying to tell people this for decades.  We are losing our 2A state by state, magazine by magazine, round by round.  There are few places left where ‚Äúshall not be infringed‚Äù is even close to being intact.  Soon we will be the UK, and soon enough Venezuela.  I‚Äôm willing to die fighting tyranny (not just regarding guns), but it‚Äôs a futile gesture to do that alone.  The call to arms that our founding fathers answered, will never happen.  But I wish there were at least an equivalent of the French Resistance to join.  War is horrible.  Oppression is worse.

                            European countries including the UK are less tyrannical than the US.
99 % conviction rates, huge prison population, militarized police, perp walks, affirmative action, cities ablaze, explicit calls for replacement: all these phenomena are part of the rich bounty of life in the US.

i like th Z-man and find many of his words wise. But he creates cynicism and a desire to see it all as hopeless.
the left took 50 years to get here. We can get back but not if we are too cynical to take baby steps.

                            The Fudds will never rise up against the ‚Äúheroic First Responders‚Äù they worship so much who get paid to kick in their doors and confiscate their guns. That‚Äôs a given.
My concern is that as gun control progresses, whites will be left defenceless against the black mobs, and the cops will go after the low-hanging fruit of the gun owners rather than going after the mob.

                    But I was told on this website (and everywhere else) that couldn‚Äôt happen. Gun owners were going to rise up if guns were confiscated. Grandma with her .38 was going to overpower the police and the military. How does this make any sense? I don‚Äôt understand how the conventional wisdom could have been so wrong.

                        One case of confiscation in St. Louis hardly proves gun ownership is dead or that attempted confiscation won‚Äôt eventually be met with resistance. The McCloskeys, BTW, are rich as Croesus and had everything to lose. Other whites will be far more desperate.

                                    Sam Francis called them Beautiful Losers.Frankly I think that is generous.Not only does our side lack ideas and motivation they flee from and are terrified of actually having to believe in anything and unwilling to take any sort of responsibility for anything larger than a family.A lot of them love to complain but ask them to put up or shut up an idea, a what would you do  and they scurry like roaches.I am slightly optimistic in that this insane shutdown crushing the economy with no recovery point will jar a few of the f&amp;cknuggets on our side out of the money uber alles trance they are in  , have them realize they need a society and they have to build it.Freedon after all is having nothing left to lose

                        I think you say this as a joke or hyperbole but that is 100% the next target of this and you see it with things like the ‚ÄúCAREN‚Äù act trying to be passed where it becomes a crime to actually call the police on blacks.
Combine that w/ the 24√ó7 full court propaganda assault and you will see da white wimmenz gladly taking the rape and black insemination for a half-black baby as ‚Äòreparations‚Äô for their ancestor‚Äôs crimes. They are building this framework in real time so your ‚Äòjoke‚Äô is actually reality.

Normies didn‚Äôt want to believe it but the writing was on the wall.  The minute I started hearing black women starting to more loudly complain about how white women were taking their black men, I knew it was coming

                                    Haiti is and was overwhelmingly Hutu. In America they make up, at most, 13% of the population. As much power as the Hutus have in this country, white women will never be coerced into conceiving nigglets and calling the cops on Hutus will never be criminalized.

                So true. They were used to poison uswhy I think that not until people are willing to openly attach Jews to our decline will things change.   Because if this really a war, then people will have to fight to win, and that fight includes ‚Äî gasp ‚Äî calling out Schlomoonce that happens.   The whole thing does a 180   And jews will start backtracking.   It might really be that simple.  If 50 million whites start screaming about it, the Jews will backpedal FAST    I have dealt with them quite a bit.  If you let them walk over you their hatred only intensifies until it becomes sadistic and cruel   But if you smack them back, they start kissing your ass.   I guess that defines a bully, huh?

                            I was being ironic. Tucker is controlled opposition, as controlled by himself as by outside compulsion. He is sharp about knowing where the electrified fence is, and going up to it but never past it.
We are better off for his being seen and heard, but at most Tucker is a stimulus for some people trying to graduate from Cucksville U.

There‚Äôs nothing he can do to assure his show‚Äôs continuation. Even as it stands the leftist establishment would like to see him off and may well succeed.

                    That describes a narcissist.  Rule #1 is never apologize for anything, to them it is an admission of guilt and trigger for a reparations demand.  Observe carefully how they behave wrt cluster b personality disorders and educate yourself on how not to fall into their traps.

                    Have to deal with Judeo-Christian nonsense first. Too many revere Jews as God‚Äôs chosen. Never mind they had the Romans crucify the Son and have been under judgement since. One wonders how so many who think America is under judgement today don‚Äôt make the connection. Sure, it‚Äôs our fault for wandering off the path, but they might ask why, or under whose influence.

                    Stuff and nonsense. ‚ÄúJewish Bolshevism‚Äù is dwarfed by Jewish infiltration and penetration of every important aspect of American Civil (and now military) society. In Russia, so tenuous was their hold, that all it took was the threat of Uncle Joe going to town ‚Äì post mortem ‚Äì to throw the damned kvetchers out‚Ä¶and into the open arms of Stupid, Dumbfuck, ‚ÄòMericans.What is it about ‚ÄòMericans that makes them feel so superior about having all these exotic pets pissing the graves of their forefathers?I‚Äôve never subscribed to the damned nonsense about ‚Äúpathological altruism.‚Äù The average middle-class white man and/or woman are some of the most selfish and grasping (not to mention boring) human beings I‚Äôve had the misfortune of having to bear. This has to be a vanity trip: essentially, I don‚Äôt think the bastards at the top consider ‚Äútheir‚Äù fellow whites as human beings. I really think that they‚Äôre repulsed by working class whites and really do want to genocide them to make room for more of my kind (and other similar exotic pets).

                        The fact remains that power in the USSR was concentrated far more intensively in the Bolshevik party than it is in US society, and that the Jews were strongly overrepresented in the highest ranks of the party. Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Sverdlov and Radek are only several of the Jewish heavy hitters. That scenario has never existed in the US and doesn‚Äôt now. Are Jews a very powerful force in ‚ÄúAmerica.‚Äù Of course. But Jews in the USSR were even more so.

                            I agree but I see the absence of prominent Jews in power as more disturbing than the Soviet experiment. Until quite recently, Organized American Jewry had become a virtuoso at pulling strings. Buttgoy ran interference and served as beards but it was virtually impossible to ‚Äúname the Jew.‚ÄùNo more. Alas. Once again, the Trotskies will make the revolution and the Bronsteins will pay the priceTL; DR: The fact the the internal security services and external espionage and counter-espionageorgansin addition tolegitimate institutionsare either enthralled to Official Jewry or directly controlled by them is unprecedented in theHistory of the Tribe.Never before so few controlled and ‚Äúowned‚Äù so much. If you have any doubts, try counting Billionaires or Media Moghuls or Sportsball team owners.No my friend, it‚Äôs better when men own power, when they expose themselves to the dangers of ruling men.Then again, perhaps they have exposed themselves thusly in recent years confident in the knowledge they they rule over husks of what used to be men for no man who voluntarily and without the slightest resistance acceptedhouse arrestand the destruction of theiridentitycan be called a man.This does nothing but evoke a Wodehousian laugh:‚ÄúThen out spake brave Horatius,The Captain of the Gate:To every man upon this earthDeath cometh soon or late.And how can man die betterThan facing fearful odds,For the ashes of his fathers,And the temples of his gods‚Äù

        Civnats like Tucker may not be interested in White identity but non-Whites are.Whites can choose to stand together on racial grounds or take a knee as demanded by non-Whites on racial grounds.As recent cucks and Karens have discovered, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on your side‚Äù and ‚ÄúI have a black husband‚Äù are not enough.Those who kneel choose dhimmitude and the jizya, second-class status and the ‚Äúinfidel tax.‚ÄùThroughout the last 20 years of Zionist wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Americans and Euros declared they would rather die than submit to such humiliation and servitude at the hands of Muslims.But now that Shlomo‚Äôs media calls dhimmitude ‚ÄúWhite Privilege‚Äù and the jizya ‚ÄúReparations,‚Äù Americans &amp; Euros eagerly take the knee and wash the feet ‚Äì because Holocaustianity and Slavery are the Passion and Exodus of their real religion, alleged Christianity or sciency atheism notwithstanding.Depending on who you ask, the worst wars are either civil, religious or racial.We‚Äôre looking at all three. And most Whites still don‚Äôt realize what side everyone else has already assigned for them.

            Exile ‚Äì Your usual excellent prose. I understand those who warn of ‚Äòpurity spiraling,‚Äô but I don‚Äôt thinktheyunderstand that all those subgroups are only in White minds. As simplistic as it sounds, your skin color is your uniform. Trying to claim as allies people who will betray you in a heartbeat (even as their own skin color will tag them for execution) is not a solid strategy. The special people who wield the megaphone know the skin color issue is a double edged sword but are betting they can escape it. I dearly hope they are dead wrong.

        If it turns out Tucker is just another fraud selling to a niche then I think many people will be depressed. It would really mean that we‚Äôre alone.Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing, maybe too many are using the existence of Tucker as some sort of comfort blanket, similar to what people did with Trump before he proved that he was nothing more than a carnival barker.I can‚Äôt be the only person who is in awe of how unanimous our societies leadership is.

                            I think you have got it exactly correct. They‚Äôll implement a mandatory civil service program for non-elite white youngsters (they‚Äôll appropriate the ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù in combination with ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù) as a peace corps but more indoctrinated. You‚Äôll need the honorable discharge marker on your social credit scorecard that follows you around everywhere.

                            They will have to enslave White and Asian men if the military hopes to keep all the fancy vehicles, weapons, and most importantly, nukes functioning.
The reason Trump brought up live nuke testing is that there are many signs and questions about the viability of the US‚Äô nuclear arsenal, which is what truly guarantees the US dollar as the world‚Äôs reserve currency.

                                    We have a known tritium reserve and also obtain tritium from foreign sources. While tritium decays by half every 12.5 years, if you possess enough then although the stockpile halves you still are able to resupply for an easily predicted time remaining. (unless you have an accident and then right now we would need to cannibalize other warheads to buy time and build production)US nuclear weapons are designed not to work unless a very precise distribution of neutrons is present in the first stage core at a set time. This is a safety consideration give the near tragedies we nearly experienced with older designs. A charged dewar stores tritium gas and basically rapidly sprays it into the hollow initiator ‚Äúpit‚Äù once the weapon arms itself. Prior to this step the weapon will not detonate into a chain reaction because there are insufficient neutrons to collide, react and make light and create focused pressure and heat. A chemically-driven neutron gun contributes additional neutrons along with the tritium in a very specific flood. These help form the permissive action links to prevent accidental or unauthorized nuclear reaction.USN has been directed to replace the Ohio class SSBNs. They must assume the NCA and Congress will follow through with tritium production soon enough to avoid being caught with our pants down by the rooskies.

                                        Thanks for this. According to the article, the ability to replace the tritium will probably end by 2035 or so. That is 15 years from now.That of course assumes other problems aren‚Äôt forthcoming or a genocidal civil war doesn‚Äôt break out which is a mid probability event right now.

                                    Tritium is currently being reprocessed from older retired nukes.  This of course is sub-optimal.  In the meantime, they pursue substitutes and possibly a new technique to make tritium.Tritium is an exciter which increases yield.  What we have now are dial a yield nukes.  You have a bomb that for example can be set to yield a few hundred kilotons to a megaton and a half or so.However, the first nukes did not use exciters like tritium.  My suspicion is that if all else fails, we still can produce such weapons.  We have tremendous stock piles of fissionable material that does‚Äôt have a half life of 12 years, but rather thousands.  And as Bush II was rumored to have said, ‚ÄúWhy the hell do we need that many (when told of 15,000 in stock)‚Äù.

If the lowest yield is selected, aside from the new B61, it‚Äôs about 4k yield no typo. The first stage is smaller than a bowling ball with the casing and works like a powerful torch inter alia on the larger secondary sparking a geometrically greater number of particles, pressure and torch emitting in the opposite direction. Then the whole kaboodle cannot contain and it releases like a pressure cooker firing up the atmosphere into a massive series of fast and recuperative waves, burning and smashing everything below or transmitting any local ground or seawater shockwaves through the paths of least resistance and crushing the voids.With increased accuracy, the megaton-class weapons were no longer desirable ‚Äî used too much material, too heavy to throw long distance, too large to fit in nosecones or bomb bays, ‚Äúminiaturization‚Äù ‚Äî just to make the rubble bounce. Consider how Spacex is recovering its first stages by landing them vertically with tremendous accuracy and without GPS (improved mathematical techniques). Similar thing with our smaller warheads.

                    The disease is real, its effects nasty though not as nasty as the powers that be want us to think at least for healthy White people.However our response is kind of logical for a dying society, People accustomed to comfort, in a society with no future, few kids and an old population are prone to react in mortal terror to something  that kills people.Something to consider, sans demographic momentum or immigration, any person who does is population decline forever. They cannot be replaced and this terrifies our leaders who are facing a destabilizing society and probably total economic collapse with no recovery point.

                I think I‚Äôve got an inkling of the ‚Äònext‚Äô crisis ‚Äì they‚Äôve been moving toward eliminating ‚Äògermy‚Äô cash for years now, but today, when I attempted to pay cash for groceries, I was instructed to read a notice.  Supposed federal shortage of coinage means that if you pay cash it‚Äôs rounded up to the next dollar and the balance is put on your store discount card.  And, if you try to get cash on a debit card purchase, there is now a fee.  Even I, an accelerationist, am shocked at just how fast things are moving.

                That depends on how you live.The problem is getting that money comes with heavy strings, if not your literal immortal soul than tons of mandatory expenditures and ways of livng design to keep anyone not in the 1% functionally poor and in their place.Most cannot be like Sam Walton.Ultimately wealth can be a prison. Also the idea that you‚Äôd leave some money for future generations and if things went well and/or they were clever it would last is deprecated.Most of today‚Äôs super rich just use the money to meddle and have no plans to pass much of it onto future generations, Soros unfortunately being an exception.If we find a way to take charge, I‚Äôd suggest an actual wealth cap. Limit income to x multiplier of the minimum wages no exceptions, ban entry of people richer than that , limit property ownership and so on.Combined with limits on who votes , States selection of Senators and heavy limits on campaign contributions (say 1 week at minimum wage per year of term, 2x for President natural persons only) and you could recreate some facet of the older yeomanry while buffering the effects of the wealthy.The rich ca‚Äôt really get rich enough to opt out and so will be in a situation where they are less liable to puruse bad policy or so one hopes.In any case a Soros figure with only say 50 million in total assets (plus a couple of houses) and limited to spending no more than what  middle class family can manage will  be much less of a menace.

                        I doubt Jeff Bezos worries about ever being poor again. He exchanged his ex-wife and tens of billions dollars for a nasty slut recently.
I live in a successful professional class household. We still clip coupons or sniff out the online equivalents and shop at sales whenever possible. With the exception of healthy foods, travel, outdoor gear, electronics and professional attire, we live far, far below our means because we have both been seriously poor and never wish to live like that again.

                            The 1% are not like the rest of the rich. The ultra rich, hundreds of millions low billions  are also pretty immune.Most rich people , the other 95% have a few million mostly in assets and do the much higher social status expenditures end up while not strapped, not flush either.Also the worst thing in their world is decline in status and dropping from say wealthy to upper middle while not bothersome to us would crush the.Most people who wouldn‚Äôt mind won‚Äôt be allowed to get rich or if they do live quietly as grey men.The economy too has been screwed up for a couple of decades.Now days because the government won‚Äôt stop spending and we cannot tax the amount   we spend, interest rates are too low.This puts a lot of wealthy people into a far less stable position as they are dependent on a very fake economy and unstable investments.I suspect most of the lower 10% of the rich will be wiped out by Covid and what remains concentrated in very few hands leading to an economic collapse.This is typically called late stage capitalism  and it is its own endgame. Basically  we ate all the seed corn and its game over.

        I wouldn‚Äôt get blackpilled on Tuck before hearing him out. He‚Äôs been on quite a roll lately. Even heroic. And I hate to think that his only principled option is to resign on-air. If he does throw Neff to the wolves, then it‚Äôll be a major disappointment, perhaps the worst of the past 4 years.

        The so-called journalist who searched through all those years of posts by Neff was himself publishing similar things as recently as 2018 when he was a campus Republican.  He looks like a Paki to me, but I‚Äôm not sure what mystery meat he is. So, of course, all of his postings are swept under the rug.  He is one of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù people because he is not a white American.  It‚Äôs disgusting on many levels.

            In the American context at least, the reality is that the right invented cancel culture, the left merely co-opted it. The American left only started dabbling in purges in the 1990s and it didn‚Äôt really take off exponentially until Obama, but the America right, thanks to the tutorship of Buckley and others before him, has been conducting brutal purges since the 1950s and 60s.

                That is a very good point.  But one major difference was that the cucked right usually only did that to swamp creatures.  They were not targeting randos.Also, the left‚Äôs cancel culture goes back way further than the Obama years.  Leftists showing up and starting violence when right wingers tried getting together somewhere has been going on since at least the 80s.  Much of the 60s stuff was that. Keep in mind that every video you have ever seen and every picture you have ever seen in terms of race relations, for example, is from the mainstream press.In 50 years, there will be people 100% oblivious to what happened in Charlottesville from our point of view with nothing but the official narrative to guide them. They managed to do this at a time when 99% of the public walks around with video cameras at all times. Imagine what existed back then showing the mainstream narrative as being entirely a lie.Just as the truth has been lost to time about the Orwellian named ‚Äúcivil rights era,‚Äù the truth about our time will be entirely forgotten and written out of the history books. The narrative will be used to attack whatever white people are left.

        The real value of anecdotes like this is that it‚Äôs evidence that we‚Äôve entered the fast-change phase of sociopolitical collapse. Tyranny is rapidly on the rise, becoming institutionalized, and the normal mechanisms of self-correction are not only absent, but being proactively eliminated in advance. That is not an accident, it is strategic and tactical intent by the incipient tyrants. The war is already hot, it‚Äôs just that the fire is currently hidden in the smoke. Act accordingly. Don‚Äôt be in a city. Summer heat will bring much more mayhem and destruction.

        IMO Its better for Tucker to stay on the air and keep pushing the alt light position than for him to not be on the air.  Now he‚Äôs helping people move in the right direction, who otherwise would not.
Whats the upside to him getting thrown off, even if he goes down in a blaze of glory?

                Creating independent platforms takes far more money than you realize, and there is no guarantee this tyrannical police state wouldn‚Äôt just shut it down or use its media assets to scare away financiers (or even deplatform it from the internet) even if do make one.

                We need political organizations. Teams of lawyers, teams of lobbyists, teams of propagandists, and probably even teams of people willing to push the enemy around (secretly) that get in their way.Alternate platforms and civil wars are things that require organizational power right now. And we have close to none.

        Tucker is an edgy cuck. His tokenism has always been a dead giveway, that and his crowing about MLK.  As glad as I am to have Tucker (he is the best person on TV), his old bow tie is being worn under his shirt as a choker collar.Tucker should have refused to accept his resignation. Does he think his enemies are just acting like they hate him and calling for his job by calling him a white supremacist as an ongoing joke?  He did this while publicly denouncing cancel culture.Nothing exposes a cuck like the subject of race. These people only know 2 ways of talking about it, apologetics and vulgar racism. They know they don‚Äôt want to be a vulgar racist and so they start doing the apologizing thing.  Whatever you do, never trust a cuck.

        Full disclaimer: I am not American nor I live in the US nor my English is perfect, but I know Carlson well.I don‚Äôt see any advantage of Carlson resigning. He is super-wealthy, he is not as brave as we would like, he doesn‚Äôt go far enough, he has friends in the Left, he may be a hypocrite. However, he  still says things that nobody else says and he reaches much more people that all the blogs of the dissident right together. He reaches the normies. The best is enemy of the good.If we had 10 TV anchors saying things like the things Carlson says, I would say: ‚ÄúRight. Go ahead. Resign‚Äù. And if we had 10 TV anchors talking like the Z man, I would consider that Carlson has to go now, even without scandal.In the dissident right (or similar), I see the same dynamics that has traditionally happened in the extreme left. The divisions because of insufficient purity. An attitude that ‚ÄúI am more authentic that you and you are a traitor and a fraud‚Äù. In short, the holiness spiral. An example is Vox Day, who thinks everybody else is useless and attacks Gab, Parler, Petterson, etc. The Z man is different and a more measured man than Vox Day but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs right this time. Carlson is a useful resource and we don‚Äôt have replacement for him.The left is a majority, has all the means and says ‚Äúno enemies to the left‚Äù We are a small minority but we are fighting with each other because of insufficient purity.

            Points well taken, but what is of utmost importance is this:
if Tucker stays on and continues to articulate the ‚Äúalternative‚Äù position, builds it up, he also can then have the power to tear it down and totally delegitimize it.

                Tucker isn‚Äôt the alternate position. He is the mainstream one from a few decades ago.This is necessary as a gateway to Our Thing which is a lot rougher or at least needs to be.

            I largely agree with imnobody00.I do not have a TV, so therefore I have little exposure to Tucker Carlson and thus these views perhaps should be taken with a grain of salt.People with views outside of the those of the ruling classes need to be realistic and not look for purity in words and actions.¬†So a useful so-called ‚Äúcuck‚Äù (Carlson?) should be supported.¬†We are in such trouble right now that even Noam Chomsky looks better than the Fortune 500 CEOs.From a brief look at the charge sheet of the Carlson‚Äôs writer (Neff), it seems that his offences are no worse than what comes daily from the ruling classes.¬†So yes, there is a double standard.¬†But that is a lesson for us when communicating with those outside our circles.¬†We really need to watch our steps 10x more than those on ‚Äúthe other side of the divide‚Äù.

                If I were Tucker I might be tempted to start my show with a strong reprimand of Neff‚Äôs actions.  But ‚Äì I would read off several of the latest anti-white rants by NYT columnists, etc., replacing the references to White with black as thought they were Neff‚Äôs.After the third quote, i would stop, look confused (as though someone handed me the wrong script) and then -reread them in original form, identifying the original source/speaker.Then ‚ÄúBy comparison, this is what Neff said: . . . ‚Äù  He can then say ‚ÄúI think all those statements are bad (blah blah civnattery) but why is Neff singled out, while these anti-white ones are not?  So and so, after her anti-white rant, got promoted!   Mr. X,  you probably haven‚Äôt heard of him, still enjoys his job, and has not been descended upon by the mob.‚Äù etc.A guy can dream.

            ‚ÄúNo enemies to the Left‚Äù is a ‚Äúgrass is always greener‚Äù myth that can lead to bad decisions on our part.The main reason why the Left gets what it wants and the Right doesn‚Äôt is that the legitimate right does not have its hands on the levers of power.  Its alleged ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù is entirely controlled and co-opted.  We have no institutional influence, as Neff‚Äôs firing demonstrates.Lefties have plenty of internal disagreements but the kosher sandwich crowd has its hands on the levers and the bottlenecks.  Nothing quells internal dissent like power.History teaches time and again that moderates, reactionaries and revolutionaries cannot form effective coalitions.  I‚Äôve cited French Far-Rightist Dominque Venner on this here before.http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/venner.htmlA big tent full of infiltrators, grifters, sellouts and edge-posting triangulators diffuses, smothers and grounds out the energy of an opposition movement.  See the Tea Party and ‚Äúmovement conservatism‚Äù in general.An overly simplistic policy of ‚Äúno infighting/no enemies on the Right‚Äù is just another kind of purity spiral.Sorting the net-negatives from the net-positives has to be done on a case-by-case basis.

            In my other post about Tucker I was going to add a line about how we would need there to be other voices in the mainstream like Tucker‚Äôs before we could advise him to do anything suicidal. Indeed this may be just a trap his bosses are setting for him to see if he takes the bait. Oddly enough, while defending even seemingly innocuous racial humor is probably still outside of what is appropriate at the moment, there are other DR ideas that it might be time to start talking about or hinting at. One obvious such idea would be the notion that maybe the races can‚Äôt really get along after all and that we could all live a lot more peacefully apart. The obvious way to broach this would be to bring on a black nationalist. Not Farrakhan or any other well known clown though.

                He should. He had a guy on Friday bragging about how he refused to apologize and weathered the storm. Tucker was glowing about it.https://youtu.be/YihXp2CCTCY?t=739
Of course, the guy‚Äôs name is Chadwick Moore, is gay and pretty much a standard issue liberal. With a name like Chadwick it is safe to assume he has a nice allowance from the family trust.

                    The crazy thing about this Tucker Carlson/Chadwick Moore clip is that they spent most of their time talking about what regular people should do if the Twitter cancel mob comes for them.Moore is essentially a professional gay Trump supporter. That‚Äôs nice if he said something blasphemous and didn‚Äôt apologize but thats not applicable to a regular guy whose job doesn‚Äôt involve writing a Breitbart column and appearing on Tucker Carlson‚Äôs show.Carlson said something about ‚Äúgoing ballistic‚Äù with HR and not making it easy for them to fire you. How the hell is that supposed to work? After the sales rep. gets fired, does he give a fiery monologue on his very own evening show on Foxnews?

        Not specifically on topic for today, but yes for what we often cover. This from a web site that I am an old fan of. They seem to not have authors I liked long ago (Bill Bonner) but I‚Äôm glad to see they get editorials from paleo-conservatives like Gary North.I wish the ‚Äúgloom and doom‚Äù press well, but they face stiff competition from mainstream media today üòÄ I thought this excerpt unusally well-written and deals with much of what we debate here.https://dailyreckoning.com/depression-and-the-great-american-exodus/‚ÄúDue to a combination of COVID-19 spreading in densely populated areas, business failures, urban riots and failing mayors and police departments, Americans are migrating from the big cities to suburban and country areas by the millions.American families are leaving dysfunctional cities such as New York City, Seattle and San Francisco and heading for Montana, Colorado, Maine and upstate New York in the Catskill Mountains among other safe havens.‚ÄùI‚Äôd add Minneapolis, Atlanta and I‚Äôm sure many more to the list.‚ÄúBig cities have always offered a trade-off between higher taxes and urban stress in exchange for entertainment, great restaurants, museums and intellectual buzz.Today the venues and buzz are gone, the crime rates are soaring and all that is left is the stress and taxes. So people are getting out.‚ÄùDon‚Äôt forget the failing (or failed) municipal government services. Defund the police? Maybe not completely, but we‚Äôll discourage them from arresting Black men. Is there civil unrest? People tresspassing on your property? We won‚Äôt defend you. If they haven‚Äôt actually broken into your home, and are in the process of raping your wife and assaulting you, why are you calling 911? Are you racist or something? If you defend yourself, you risk arrest, or at least the police confiscating your weapon [How the hell can they seize the weapon and the owners face no criminal charges?]‚ÄúChanges like this are not temporary. Once people move out, they don‚Äôt return ever. Their children may return someday but that could be 15 or 20 years away.‚ÄùMaybe not ‚Äúnever,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure yuppies living in tiny $4,000/mo. apartments, or contemplating a $1,500,000 restored home in a once-historic neighborhood that was (and is still surrounded) by simians living in decrepit homes, with violent crime rates to match, is comparable to what was lost when the middle-class moved out decades ago, not long after white people lost control of neighborhoods and the factory jobs started to disappear.Just take a moment to wrap your head around what Rickards is saying: the new exodus isn‚Äôt the middle class who relied on public schools; those people were given a reason to leave half a century ago. No, today‚Äôs flight may be those who had the children in private education, but they can no loger ignore the other deteriorations of their city. While the politically-connected and grift-funded positions will allow some to halg on longer, a lot of jobs in the cited industries (‚Äúthe dreaded private sector‚Äù) are gone, if not forever, then plenty long enough for them to get laid off, the BMW repossessed and the pricey little home foreclosed, along with all the other travail that entails. These people are wise to move to greener (should I say whiter?) pastures while the gettin‚Äô is good. After all, times are looking down. Yale or Harvard for the little one doesn‚Äôt seem so appealing if the courses must be by video. She can do the same at the community college.The St. Louis couple whose AR-15 was arrested üôÇ had to hire private security when the demonstrators returned. Again, what was the purpose of a public police force? To protect people? Apparently not all the time. Most folks can‚Äôt afford private security, though.‚ÄúAnd those who leave tend to have the most capital and the most talent. This leaves the cities as empty shells populated by oligarchs with personal bodyguards and the poor, who have to deal with the street-level violence.This shift can be helpful for individuals who move, but it‚Äôs devastating for the economics of major cities. And that‚Äôs devastating for the U.S. economy as a whole.‚Äù

            ‚ÄúGreat restaurants‚Äù are a big deal to people too lazy or incompetent to cook. People without creativity and internal resources need to buy manufactured entertainment. Cities are full of folks like that.

                Now that the restaurants all use Mexican cooks, how good can any of them be?  It‚Äôs a joke.  All the crap tastes the same. Everything is over salted, over seasoned.   But go to Europe where they actually have artists of the palette, and that‚Äôs different league altogether

                    All the crap tastes the same because 99% of restaurants buy all of it from distributors like Gordon Foods or Sysco.
The very few genuine farm-to-table restaurants are treasures that should be supported, though they can be hard to find.

                    Indeed.  Reminds me on one of our favorite ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù restaurants in my now Hispanic majority city.  Year by year, the back room staff got more and more Hispanic, but the food, decor, and ambiance remained more or less Italian.   What are you going to do?One day the served me my favorite dish and they used some sort of white cheese‚Äînot ricotta or mozzarella.  I asked what this was, and they replied that‚Äôs the cheese they always use.  They had no idea of cheese differences.  For that matter, they had no idea as to how to make the dish, nor any taste for Italian food and especially this dish.I told them to shove it and left, never to return.  The restaurant closed within the year.  Now this was a restaurant that the year prior always had a waiting line to be seated.

                        In Canada it‚Äôs all Indian people. From McDonalds to high end restaurants.
The food is always bland, overcooked, sloppily put together, and made without passion. (This is happening in all our industries and nations btw. Aliens poorly doing some stuff that whites used to do).
The only ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù I have for eating out is that I get lazy. But I‚Äôm working on it. Even simple chicken recipes I make are 100x better than the crap at restaurants.

            What your post deals with is exactly what we are dealing with right now, should we sell our L.A. home and rent it out (i.e. keep our L.A. footprint should we ever want to return) or sell it and bail.
How may millions of whites had to uproot themselves?  Leave friends and family and careers behind because of this mess?  All you hear is how bad it is for poor people from Mexico and how hard it must be for them to separate from their families back homeCry me a river

            I am suspicious of the term ‚Äúmillions‚Äù, here‚Äôs why.  Folks who move are of two ilk basically, those who work and those who are retired.  If you work, you simply can‚Äôt quit your employment easily and take off.  Suburbia, or rural areas simply don‚Äôt supply the employment opportunities these folk require.
I suspect these estimates are from surveys.  Let‚Äôs see how the population figures fall over the next decade.  Not that they are not already treating that way in big Blue States and Cities.

                Suburbia is hell for a young person. If they‚Äôre lucky enough to have friends in the area they sit in the basement smoking weed and playing videogames all day. Alot just have no social life.The vibrancy risk is worth it for young people with no kids. My guess is that we will see a mass of families (30 somethings) move out of the city though.Don‚Äôt know much about rural areas, I‚Äôd imagine that they‚Äôre pretty cozy if you have good social networks and a decent job. But a) there are no jobs in rural areas and b) in Ontario at least the rural areas are at least 60% Boomers.

        This post knocks it out of the park, revealing how conservatism is and always has been nothing but concessions, surrender and retreat. Civic nationalism, of which Carlson is the most prominent avatar, really is a dead end.I have to thank people like Z Man and some of the TRS guys for making me re-evaluate our impulse to surrender to leftism at every turn. Striker, for example, recently questioned our impulse to reject higher education, formal culture (the arts and humanities), urbanity and other bastions of leftism by arguing that by continually rejecting these and ceding them to the left, we remain forever on the retreat, only allowing the left to grow ever more powerful to attack the next arena we retreat to.I think Striker‚Äôs point is that too often we fall into the trap of thinking along the lines of ‚ÄúWell, if X has been hopelessly corrupted by the left, I‚Äôll abandon it and retreat to Y,‚Äù rationalizing the retreat by telling ourselves ‚ÄúY is whererealwhite people will find redemption and purify themselves anyway.‚Äù Every time, in just a few years, the left only grows stronger and finds a way to destroy Y, so we retreat to Z and rationalize that to ourselves.You see this constant retreat in the way the right has surrendered higher education and culture to the left. The right has trained itself to think that if these areas have been hopelessly corrupted, the solution is to cede them entirely to the left by abandoning academia, avoiding sending our kids to college, and defunding things like the art world and the National Endowment for the Arts. Striker asks why our response isn‚Äôt tochallenge and conquerthese fields by sendingmoreof our people into them so that we can develop muscular artists, philosophers, writers, poets and teachers of our own to crush the leftist degeneracy that has settled into our institutions ever since WWI. How will we ever be able to create a new society for normie if we never develop our own academic and higher culture that can put Foucault, Intersectionality, and Hannah-Jones on the run? For decades the right has retreated into the assumption that leftist lunacy will somehow be corrected ‚Äúwhen it has to go to work and face the real world,‚Äù but by failing to confront the left where they are we‚Äôve only allowed them to mold the real world to their perversions and degeneracy. Remember in the Obama era when the right dismissed wokeness as a harmless Tumblr echo chamber that would die instantly when it entered the coporate world? Well now the entire corporate world is Tumblr.Academia, the arts and higher culture don‚Äôt have to be leftist by default, and by assuming these fields are somehow illegitimate for ‚Äúreal‚Äù white people, who would somehow be better off by becoming plumbers, truckers and farmers, we only guarantee our perpetual retreat. I‚Äôm still sympathetic to arguments for avoiding higher education on the grounds of things like not going into debt, but I‚Äôm coming around to Striker‚Äôs argument that we shouldn‚Äôt retreat into dirt people vocations by default expecting any kind of salvation or protection from degeneracy, because we‚Äôll discover in a few years that the left will only find a way to attack us exactly where we‚Äôve retreated to. By maintaining its iron grip over the universities, the left will develop sophisticated ideological frameworks for replacing truckers with self-driving trucks, deliberately seeding the ideology into the allied world of Globohomo corporatism for them to do the dirty work of condemning former truckers to a life of OxyContin.A similar cowardly retreat can be seen in the right‚Äôs longstanding rejection of urbanity by default, laboring under the assumption that the only solution for white people is to somehow retreat into the countryside, only further atomizing ourselves and setting ourselves up for eventual slaughter by the left. I‚Äôve long been sympathetic to the argument that maybe we can protect ourselves by abandoning the cities, but I‚Äôm coming around to Striker‚Äôs argument that this might just be another historic failure of conservatism. So I guess I still have nothing against anyone who relocates to the countryside if they truly love country living, gardening and open spaces, but retreating simply on the grounds that white people will find some kind of salvation and security in the fields and woods might be just another failed conservative cope. South Africa shows us that by retreating to the countryside, we‚Äôre only atomizing ourselves and allowing the left to eventually pick us off one by one as we cower in our farmhouses and cabins (how is one guy with a gun going to fight off an expeditionary mob of BLM raiders?), and make no mistake, the left is already plotting how to use the South African method in the former territories of the US.https://grist.org/justice/white-people-own-98-of-rural-land-young-black-farmers-want-to-reclaim-their-share/https://inequality.org/research/owns-land/Conservatism has assumed since its inception that cities are illegitimate dens of sin, but they have and always will be power centers from which culture will be imposed on all of society, so by failing to engage, colonize and convert the cities the right is once again always on the retreat. Ironically, you can‚Äôt create a neo-Jeffersonian yeoman society until you seize the cities and change the way they exert power over culture. Historically white people have been quite happy raising large families in the cities, and their doing so is exactly why there was a concerted effort to crush urban white ethnocentrism and the former power it exerted over our culture. Creating a new aggressive urban white ethnocentrism is, ironically, the only way to allow those whites whoaretruly at home in the countryside to be left alone in the manner Jefferson wanted.https://devinhelton.com/lost-world-of-west-philadelphiaI would go even further than Striker in arguing that the culture of retreat might not just be the defining characteristic of conservatism per se but perhaps the driving force behind theentireformer US. The culture of retreat is what truly sets white America apart from white Europe, which was always too densely populated to indulge in a culture of retreat and why France, for example, has Yellow Vests who are willing to protest for years on end but Americans are more inclined to retreat to a suburb to ‚Äúgrill in peace.‚Äù The western 2/3 of the US was settled under the implicit program of sending off anyone who couldn‚Äôt hack it in the urbanizing east. Our entire national mythos, reflected in our historic romanticism of settler culture, of cowboys-and-Indians, of ‚Äúwhite flight‚Äù to the suburbs, is one of constant retreat into the countryside and the wilderness in search of redemption that only ever turned out to be a temporary reprieve. Once the frontier closed the US really saw a nervous breakdown and, surprise, now even Provo, Utah has BLM terrorism.https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/historical-archives/the-significance-of-the-frontier-in-american-historyI thank Striker, Z Man and others for forcing me to rethink and question our long habit of concession, retreat and surrender. Whatever ‚Äúour thing‚Äù will grow into, I‚Äôm realizing that we can‚Äôt fall into MAGA nostalgia. There‚Äôs nothing left to ‚Äúbring back‚Äù or retreat to, there are only new worlds to create by seizing them from the left and rebuilding them for our ends.

            Excellent comment. I disagree with a bit of it, but the overall condemnation of retreat as a survival strategy is dead on. Charles Murray‚Äôs recent behavior shows where that always leads, and he initially tried with half-measures such as his full-throated defense of HRC, for God‚Äôs sake. Not good enough, he learned.

                That‚Äôs fair, and I‚Äôm not even sure I have it all figured out yet or necessarily agree with every nuance in the emerging ‚Äústay and fight‚Äù stance. But the ‚Äústay and fight‚Äù intellectual position is a lot more satisfying and fulfilling than the tired old ‚Äúgive up and regroup‚Äù ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù of conservatism.For example, you can made a good argument that young people, especially young women, should avoid college not because it‚Äôs ‚Äúleftist‚Äù but because they should wait untilafterthey get married and have kids. There‚Äôs no reason a couple can‚Äôt get married right out of high school and the wife can raise the kids for afull decadeuntil they begin developing autonomy, then the wife can always return to college at the still very young age of 28.But this is a totally different argument and strategy than the typical conservative argument for fleeing, ceding and shutting down the colleges because they‚Äôre supposedly leftist by nature. They don‚Äôt need to be.

                    Academia is imploding now, and it is an opportune time to infiltrate (usually as an adjunct since that is about the only position available for the foreseeable future; the issue is whether enough income can be generated). I‚Äôm mostly with you on academia and just cited Murray as to illustrate the intensity and barriers to dissent let alone entry. Murray‚Äôs greatest mistake was giving an inch because he was secure, and  he more or less has discredited his own work. While adjuncts rarely move on to tenure, it is possible. Paper trails are required to do so, so a little taqquiya is in order. Abandoning higher education was indeed a huge mistake and entry can be attained only through subterfuge.To illustrate how shaky the Academy is now, look at the wailing and gnashing of teeth over the visa denials for foreign students, who pay cash, if the only classes will be on line. Some of the top schools now just require acceptance and tuition payment to earn a degree as it is. This really started with Yale Law thirty or so years back when it adopted a policy that once accepted, a B average was all but guaranteed. Yale Law doesn‚Äôt really expect attendance and examinations are more or less formalities. That less than rigorous program has spread to other top schools, undergrad and professional. If they could, some of these schools would outright sell diplomas. At some point there will be a demand for more rigor, and actual education will make a comeback. Being an adjunct with lots of classroom experience will command more attention then.Deferred education is a wise idea for young women who want children. The same is true of men, who should consider acquisition of some wealth over taking loans.Where I depart, at least to some degree, is on urban living. For our more vulnerable, which is to say the elderly and parents with children, immediate safety issues are paramount. Those less fragile have opportunities now, though. The orchestrated riots and Covid overreaction were designed to dismantle the last vestiges of the middle class in the major cities, primarily small shop and service industry owners. If someone is willing to fight, those goods and services are still needed. Housing itself will be cheaper soon. So those who don‚Äôt have to flee should be discouraged.

                        Agree strongly with your point on urban living: there are plenty of people for whom deteriorating urban safety is the overarching issue and the only safe place (for now) to raise kids or look after elders is in the suburbs or countryside.I think it was Sailer‚Äôs writings that first clued me in to the power that the white working class formerly held in cities. In college we‚Äôre taught a somewhat false narrative (which only furthers our imperative to reclaim universities lest we lose our real history) that white people inherently hated cities and used ‚Äúgenerational wealth‚Äù to flee to the suburbs, but the Philly link in my first post, which I vaguely recall Sailer discussing years ago, reveals how incomplete that narrative is.The Philly story reveals that while some white people may have fled for more open space so their families could spread out and grow, many other families were driven out quite literally at gunpoint. They had fond memories of their old urban neighborhoods and were not remotely happy at leaving them. Furthermore, since the white working class had no ‚Äúgenerational wealth‚Äù to buy new houses, they were forced to start from scratch in the suburbs. They were hardly coddled by the federal government, contrary to official academic narratives.A dirty secret behind most redlining maps is that it was actually working classwhiteneighborhoods that were redlined, with the era‚Äôs relatively small number of redlined urban black neighborhoods as an insignificant footnote. Redlining of working class white neighborhoods added another incentive to white flight: if you couldn‚Äôt make any renovations to your commodious, sturdy four-square Detroit house with the wraparound porch, you had no choice but to abandon it for a single-story vinyl shoebox in Warren.Apart from dribs and drabs from Sailer over the years, I‚Äôm not sure any dissident rightists have done any ‚Äúdeep dives‚Äù into the reality of white flight to the suburbs in the 50s, 60s and 70s.

                            The Helton link was quite good, but the bottom line is black violence and not governmental policyper seactuallydrove Whites out of southwestern Philly. We could do a Venn Diagram of violence/the fear thereof and redlining working class neighborhoods to determine what caused Whites to flee. There would be some overlap but the former circle would be vastly larger than the latter.The pattern essentially was the White working class, bolstered by unions, were the power center until Black predators were brought into the mix to block bust (the link did mention this). When that ran its course, riots were orchestrated to drive out the White working class remnant. After a point, progressive young Whites were encouraged to move into the fringes of these now-feral neighborhoods and  gentrify them. I suspect the recent orchestrated riots were coordinated to drive out these newest arrivals, who bought while in denial and still try to ignore  the urban predators just notice their skin color.The only real question I have is who the folks in little hats plan to have to snap up these properties. Non-hipster Whites are moving back into Detroit, for example, and notably there were no riots there. Blacks, incidentally, are moving at a faster clip into Detroit‚Äôs suburbs. I usually can discern the strategy in these things but this is hard to disentangle. We will know soon enough.To complete the circle, cities can be reclaimed on a case-by-case basis but we should respect decisions by the fragile not to stick it out. Things are hot now and urban Whites are on the front lines. There need to be more of them and they have to be young, fit  and independent.

            Eric Striker? He‚Äôs a mixed bag when he‚Äôs speaking outside of politics and fringe culture. I remember reading two particular articles on National-Justice, one on so-called ‚ÄúJewish science‚Äù and another on the military. In the former, all that time spent skipping high school science and smoking weed behind the bleachers was obvious. In the latter, he pulled all the same inane conflations lefties commit ‚Äì being anti-war and anti-military.
That said, he talks like he‚Äôs got an actual sack, so whatever. Hey man, we all got to get redpilled somewhere. You could do worse than this crazy dude.

                I was pro-war and pro-military for decades and all it did was make Israel stronger and get White American kids killed and maimed using White American tax dollars.
It also resulted in green cards for  millions of Benedict Akbar Muslims who betrayed their own countries and kin for shekels and whose kids now compete with the children of those White soldiers for jobs and college admissions.
How many Iraqi, Afghani and Syrian refugees and collaborators are flooding Israel right now?

            CR, I caught Striker‚Äôs comments on academia and urbanity.I agree with him that we should not be ‚Äúanti-intellectual‚Äù but let‚Äôs keep in mind that you don‚Äôt need an Ivy PhD to know what you‚Äôre talking about. Ideology and philosophy are very important and its critical that some of Our Guys bring big brains and solid research and thinking to the table on these subjects.As for urbanity, I‚Äôve posted on this on our members site and also brought it up in comments with Striker on TRS.Our take is ‚Äúevery guy needs to make his own decisions based on his own circumstances.‚ÄùStiker‚Äôs an urbanite who wants to preserve the old ethnic neighborhoods in places like New York &amp; Philly. I get that. If you have that kind of base to work from, make that your ground to stand on.But there are some places like Baltimore &amp; St. Louis (and much of LA County) where it makes no sense. You don‚Äôt have the Whites around you to form a ‚Äúband of brothers‚Äù much less a larger White community capable of defending itself like the Philly Italian baseball enthusiasts did recently.I‚Äôm with Borzoi of TRS in supporting ‚ÄúWhite Futurism.‚Äù We can‚Äôt ‚Äúre-found America‚Äù or simply retreat into a Trad lifestyle.Other commenters here as well as I have made a years-long point of emphasizing that we‚Äôre not retreating ala the Benedict Option and that we don‚Äôt want to be anti-tech Luddites.The internet is the most important means of getting our message out to a wide audience. We need to use technology and engage with modernity ‚Äì but without letting it ruin us.We‚Äôre focusing on training our young guys present and future to be more effective cultural and social warriors and to be aware of the very complex and deep issues it‚Äôs going to take to beat Shlomo and take back our sovereignty in town &amp; country alike.Neither UPIC (you pick your neighbors or ‚Äúundeclared physical intentional communities‚Äù) or SYG (‚Äústand your ground‚Äù) are one-size-fits-all strategies. They‚Äôre two compatible ways of achieving the overall goal of physically organizing atomized Whites into communities again. Without that base, we can‚Äôt win and that‚Äôs why our opponents push back so hard against White community.

        Hyperbole, the inflated language and imagery of advertising to which we have been conditioned for decades, is now the only acceptable form of public discourse. No one has to think. The middle school magic words and the non-stop visual examples of beautiful people performing sanctioned acts are expected to fill in all of the moral weight needed to make a point or to buy the product. Carlson will risk very little to save the help. He will say enough to maybe save himself.¬†However he does it he will first accept most of the moral landscape of the anti-whites and he will use their language with a few twists and turns to signal that he is on board plus or minus a few caveats.We all pay a lot of lip service to not using the language of our enemies but it is all around us and impossible to always avoid unless we become linguistic paranoids.¬†To play in the public sphere is to loose before we even begin.  Carlson may survive this but it will cost him something in how he moves forward. He‚Äôll then get a few more repeat performances until he‚Äôs gone.The only way to survive is to regroup and pull yourself out of the mainstream social milieu as much you can.¬†That‚Äôs regroup and not become a lone wolf. What‚Äôs best for you may not be best for someone else but find some way to begin building your own network of dissidents.¬†Dissident is now anyone who thinks or feels that whites have to begin looking out for white local and more than local interests. Chapter and verse can come later.¬†The language we use must become our own and not that of our enemies.If you continue to operate only in the milieu of our enemies you become their plaything and a little bit of your soul will be ripped out of you day by day.

        I get the notion of choosing sides, I just happen to think our conflict has more than two.  I‚Äôm not sure what our purity test looks like but I tend to think Tucker‚Äôs pulpit (mansions notwithstanding) brings more allies to our side than any other, including Trump.  I don‚Äôt begrudge Tucker‚Äôs success and don‚Äôt know if his lead-writer‚Äôs character is worthy of defense.  I‚Äôm not even a Tucker apologist (I‚Äôve only read a few of his monologues) but sense that he‚Äôs closer to our side than the Marxist rabble he mocks..  Maybe this post is setting us up for the reality that good people will sometimes disappoint us ‚Äì absolutely true.  But if I were applying a purity test for choosing sides I‚Äôd put Tucker on the outskirts of the dissident camp; let‚Äôs quibble about the finer points once the Bolsheviks are defeated.

            I don‚Äôt want to come off as aggressively rude, but I will be succinct. How many sides can there be? I mean you either join the negro and Antifa mobs or you don‚Äôt.

                Understandable response. For simplicity then, let‚Äôs go ahead and agree to two sides, Side A and Side B. Side A may be divided into constituent parts, e.g. A1, A2, A3, etc. For simplicity let‚Äôs call everyone on this site a perfect A1. Does that make A3 my enemy? Is A4 on the side of Antifa because he buys Starbucks coffee or watches the NFL? Or to answer your question ‚Ä¶ if Tucker goes along with the firing of his head writer, does that mean he‚Äôs joined the Antifa mob?  Would you agree that nuance is important?  Might we have impure allies that our serve our cause?

                    I get that, but my sense is that there are only two sides. Yes, there may be derivations of a theme, or subsets within a side, but at the end of the day either your gun is pointed at Us or at ThemThere are many reasons people are on this side, or subsets. There are lovers of western civilization and culture, there are tradesman fearing losing their jobs to illegals, there are Christians who don‚Äôt want to see the churches in flames, there are guys who are sick over the loss of basic due process.  And there is always some overlap.But we all share the same basic goal.  That goal is not precise or articulated, it may be inchoate, but we know who is on our side when we run into each other.  Like that old expression, I can‚Äôt define art but I know when I see it.  Well, I can‚Äôt define exactly what it is that makes one want to join this side versus the other side, but I know when I see it.

                        I‚Äôd like to upvote and amplify what you and CAPT S said and also point out that a lot of these seeming contradictions arise from our failure, as people who can live only in one moment at a time, to consider that revolutions happen in spaceand time.In physics you can draw a particle‚Äôs ‚Äúworldline‚Äù and it can sometimes clarify problems in relativity or particle physics.  This is usually drawn with space on the x-axis and time on the Y.  Since we can‚Äôt really draw 4D graphs the convention is to collapse all of 3D space to that one dimension on the x-axis.Revolution can be imagined as a lot of groups as initially separate particles with separate worldlines.  As time goes on, some particles may diverge, representing an increase in the number of factions.  Others may converge.  Once you have essentially 2 (maybe 3) large particles, you have the makings of a revolution.  You might also think in terms of energy gathering into two large ‚Äúpoles‚Äù with a large amount of potential energy between them, similar to charge separation in thunderstorms.So what about Tucker?  I hope he doesn‚Äôt cuck tomorrow but if he does, it might just not be his time to move all the way over to here on the x-axis as it were.  That doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt draw other particles closer to himself and thus eventually, to us.

                        Yeah, that‚Äôs basically true, but that is our nature.  I realize the blacks do not have the problem.  But should we become like them to defeat them?  Maybe we have to as much as it stinks, just for the time being.  That mens we beat them at their own game, and it will totally demoralize them.  Then we can go back to being complicated white people

                    Depends how polarized things get and/or how how hair-splitting we wish to be. For example, in Jim Crow times, there clearly were successful, responsible Blacks, as there are today. But when segregation was mandated, the better blacks acted as a stabilizer to the all-black community. This of course has been mostly absent since 1960s at least. What relevance does this have? Now imagine a scenario where there is an actual movement towards racial separation. Such conservative Blacks (call them ‚ÄúUncle Toms‚Äù ‚Äî their own people sure will calling them that or worse.) would at once be our storngest ‚Äúallies‚Äù, in the sense that they would provide stability to an Apartheid community, yet on the racial/tribal level many would consider them the enemy.

                        This is almost certainly how it has to be.  I‚Äôve said here before that I think this will come down to a triangular configuration of black, white, and hispanic nationalists working together to defeat the parasite/globalist faction.  It will be a bit confusing because some whites, (((whites))), blacks, and hispanics, will be nationalists while others fall in with the parasitic globalist elite.The various nationalist groups also would actually have some common values.  Some of the mythical black and hispanic Republicans are actually not that mythical.  Think ofColion Noir.  Note that I‚Äôm not saying that these guys are more than a tiny fraction of their groups but as we‚Äôve seen well organized (((tiny fraction))) can rule a much larger group.A basic foundation of traditional masculine values, opposition to globo/homo, traditional sex roles ‚Äì these are actually likely to be the foundations of all three racial homelands and the tri-states could even form a loose mutual defense pact somewhat like what the US was actually supposed to be before the federal government basically seized all the power.

            I prefer a different analogy to the two-sides paradigm. We are evolving into two distinct sub-species, one that is inherently productive by nature (old school evolution) and another that devolved into acquired parasitism. The former thrives in an environment emphasizing freedom, and the latter can only survive in an environment of authoritarianism.

                Dutton recently divided/described the current population into two groups; those who 200 years ago would be considered normal and representative of the Darwinian concept of ‚Äúfittest‚Äù and those (only now living) whom Woodley has described as spiteful mutants‚Äîthose of the species that would not have survived without the modern welfare state providing protection and support for them.Dutton further states in essence that this group of people by and large suffer from genetic mutation load that 200 years ago was naturally selected out of the population, but alas has been allowed to populate and expand within the normal society.OK, it‚Äôs a reach and I‚Äôm only thinking it primarily refers to the White race.  But it‚Äôs a thought that rings true in the back of my mind as the only reasonable explanation of the phenomenon we are experiencing.

            I will find Tucker‚Äôs inevitable disavowal of this guy discouraging, but I can‚Äôt think that Tucker saying ‚ÄúF you!‚Äù and resigning will produce a better result for our side of the great divide. The quote about ‚ÄúHypocrisyis a tributevice pays to virtue‚Äù comes to mind here. And we have to be continuously aware that Lefty wields a very powerful weapon ‚Ä¶ virtually no one can withstand the R-word allegation, so until the time that such an allegation isn‚Äôt the reputation equivalent of a nuclear weapon, I don‚Äôt see how our side can afford to be so cavalier in how and where it expresses its opinions. Z-Man‚Äôs point about not playing the villain in someone else‚Äôs psychodrama is exactly right. This guy gained no converts, influenced no one, and hurt the cause by the casual display of his unvarnished opinions. Last week I mentioned to a libertarian friend that the government appears to use big business to get around its own restrictions on freedom of speech. He then took onboard Sam Francis‚Äô concept of Anarcho-Tyranny. He commented positively ‚Ä¶ he ratcheted one notch towards our side of the great divide. If I had then dumped the entire Z-Man world view on him, he would have recoiled, because the conditioning remains too strong. But he‚Äôs moving in our direction, one person, one notch at a time.If I arrived at work wearing a Che Gueverra shirt, no one would dare say anything to me. If someone at work found a picture of me wearing a MAGA hat, I‚Äôd likely face sanction. (I‚Äôm in military, work in DC. Don‚Äôt believe me: last week, the Army labeled the term MAGA as White Supremacy as part of their service-wide struggle session curriculum) That‚Äôs real power ‚Äì we may not like it, but we have to respect it. Facing Lefty head on will produce a 1991 Gulf War result. We have to assume the tactics of an insurgency, which requires among other things, a long view and a focus on the strategic goal, instead of short-term tactical victories. The fundamental lesson of my year at the War College could be boiled down to Strategic and Operational victory are not simply the sum of Tactical success. Tucker saying F You! to Fox might be a tactical success, but it sets back the long term strategic goal. Tucker remaining on tv serves to aid our side. He‚Äôs very effective at slowly deprogramming the CivNats. That‚Äôs incredibly valuable, even if it requires casting one of our own into the void. So I respectfully quibble at Z Man‚Äôs view in this case.OT ‚Ä¶ CAPT S, the movie Greyhound captures the feel of surface ship command at sea like nothing else I‚Äôve ever watched.

if Tucker becomes the standard bearer for our side, he can also completely undermine our side should he choose. Say he wakes up one day and starts crying to the camera about how wrong he‚Äôs been. Or whatever.
at that point, all the white guy fence sitters are back on the other side and are laughing at Tucker and us. ‚ÄúWhy did I ever take you guys seriously lol. Your guy there is crying on tv   What losers   Going to watch a football game now   Bye‚Äù

                Good point. I‚Äôve never been in a position to wield such authority, nor would I want to be, but it‚Äôs a grim fact that in military and other high-risk matters, sometimes you must balance sacrificing one to save ten, or ten to save a hundred, etc. It sucks to have to choose ‚Äúslightly less damned‚Äù but sometimes it is a forced move. Add to this those who sit in your judgment after the fact, looking for the tiniest flaw so they can flay you to signal their own virtue, and you just add to the mental burden certain leaders must bear.Relevant to the current ‚Äúcancel culture,‚Äù I think we are seeing the ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù of the idea of quickly finding the scapegoat whenever possible, as applied to fighting the Evil Racism at least: Carson‚Äôs writer is only the latest example; there are many other writers, announcers and so on that have lost their jobs for a slip of the tongue or something they have said a year or a decade ago.

        While the odds that Tucker cucks are five to one (if even that), I will hear him out tomorrow night. His mansion and family were swarmed by Marxists but he continued to broadcast in the same vein afterwards. So that garners him a little sympathy from me. Given I fully expect Tucker to cuck, tomorrow probably will be the last time I watch Fox, which actually is more insidious than CNN and MSNBC because it lulls people to sleep. If Tucker refused to comply and migrated to OAN it would be a gift to us. Again, I don‚Äôt expect that to happen but there is an outside possibility. The Murdoch cucklings, ironically, probably would prefer him to do so as well.It comes down to whether Tucker‚Äôs continued presence outweighs the self-humiliation he will endure, which will blow onto us. I actually was convinced by earlier comments that if he grovels this very well could signal a future betrayal. His departure or self-abasement, whichever he chooses, still will be a loss and we should acknowledge as much. Revealing the Judeo-Bolshevik Susan Rosenberg as the evil monster she is was a huge positive, for example. Tucker has touched on the ongoing white genocide; no other mainstream voice has. This information will become even more restricted with Carlson gone even if, by some miracle, he departed for OAN.If someone as anodyne as Tucker has to be humiliated or fired, many if not the majority of his viewers will learn a valuable lesson tomorrow night.It is time for choosing. I hope Carlson makes that choice and it is the right one.

            Here are my odds, albeit with qualifiersA.  100%  cuck =  10%B.  0% cuck = 0%C.  75% cuck + 25% stick up for Neff = 70%D.  25% cuck + 75% stick up for Neff = 20%A.  Throws Neff under the bus in the vein of ‚ÄúI knew Neff for years and NEVER knew him to be a person who would say such atrocious, abhorrent things.  I‚Äôm shocked and saddened.  I had considered him a friend.  His personal opinions do not reflect mine or the network‚Äôs. His firing is justified and moral‚Äù.  Then he taps his notecards on the desk and proceeds into a monologue.B.  ‚ÄúWhat Neff had to say is his personal business, and he should have every right to say it.  His firing is wrong and immoral, caving to a mob of lunatics, and I will not stand for it.  I cannot in good conscience stand for it.  For to do so would violate every belief I hold dear and have been trying to communicate in this broadcast.  As of this evening, I resign.‚ÄùC.  ‚ÄúWhat he said was wrong and immoral, I do not agree with it, these are not my views or those of the network.  And in the spirit of America and our traditions of giving people a second chance, I have asked management to give him a second chance, but they refused.  I accept their decision.  They are a private entity and I am their employee and ultimately have to adhere to their standards.  We all wish Neff the best of luck moving forward‚ÄùD. ‚ÄúWhat Neff said was tame by most standards of the internet, or typical banter one hears playing call of duty online or visiting any myriad of websites where such things pale in comparison.  He got caught up in the moment, like many of us do in these heated times.  However we here at this network are contractually obligated to refrain from actions that may shine negatively on the network and all of its employees whose livelihoods cannot be jeopardized or tainted by a single individual, and in that spirit I accept the network‚Äôs decision to terminate his employment.  He will be missed.‚Äù.

                Nicely laid out, Falcone, but you missed the most obvious and desirable choice, as has everyone else here. Tucker can cite and quote any number of murderously vicious‚Äîincluding genocidal‚Äîanti-white hate-statements from well-known spokesmen on the Left who hold MSM positions or similar megaphones. When they make those statements of hatred and murder against whites, who complains? Where is the blowback? Is there ANY blowback? No. ‚ÄúUntil those voices are noted and condemned, there is no reason to punish the mild humor of my friend and writer Mr. Neff, who is exercising his 1st Amendment right to criticize the dangerous and hateful Left.

                    Frip, if Carlson cucks and throws his friend under the bus in order to ‚Äústay on the air,‚Äù it will be a huge win for the Leftist scum and a serious defeat for our side.

        Recall that the issue precipitating this is cancel culture. When Carlson cucks, as is certain, how will he ever opine about cancel culture again? Or does it even matter to normiecons, if in fact a vast majority of them will never cross the river to dissident shores? Is it possible to even discuss overreactions to mere jokes made online? Jokes that one has to actively discover, not ones spoken casually in public? Can Carlson discuss how this illustrates there are protected classes now who may not only say anything they like (casual glance at the sewer called Twitter) about the unprotected class but may even riot with support from authorities? Who are these classes, the protected and the unprotected?These rhetorical questions answer themselves, apparently. We arrive at the familiar impasse, the futility of talking about progressive hypocrisy. (Recall that silly ruckus over crosshairs graphics and Palin.) It‚Äôs almost like DR3. Progressives don‚Äôt care because their opponents are literally Hitler, and normiecons must signal against Hitler too; far too risky to do otherwise.Maybe there is no point discussing cancel culture with normiecons‚Ä¶ at least there is no reason to have normiecon media do so since they are perfectly willing to cancel their own allies to remain relevant in Georgetown.Perhaps what is discouraging is all the normiecons who bang on their armchairs about DR3 will likely approve when Carlson throws his writer to the wolves. Normiecons  could teach progressives whole college courses on hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance.

            that‚Äôs why he is going to thread the needle
My guess is that FNC has hired the best publicists and ‚Äúcrisis advisors‚Äù money can buy to help him thread the needle.  I bet there is focus group testing going on right now.  They don‚Äôt want him totally deflated and laughed out of town ‚Äî not just yet

        The issue for Whites is obvious and simple (one would think): &lt;b&gt;rule or be ruled&lt;/b&gt; ‚Äî so it has always been; so it is now ‚Äî and whatever else one might say, currently Whites are getting a very good look at who their future rulers will be, as well as who will be electing them.

        It is not black and white.
Tucker gets the ratings he does, from the people he does. They will not take kindly to cuckservatism. The other portion of his audience are those that love to hate him. If he cucks to them, their battle is won and they will tune out and search for other witches to burn.I‚Äôve tuned out of the mass media so whatever they do will be of very little consequence to me.

if he does, the jokes write themselves
my bet is he cucks  75% and is ambiguous about it enough that he leaves enough meat on the bone to satisfy his conservative audience

                That‚Äôs a cope.  Tucker is a true believer. Virtually everything he says is in line with true believing cuckservatives.  I have taken flak right here on this comment section for pointing out Tucker‚Äôs tokenism problem.  You don‚Äôt need to trot out a token to talk about something truthfully and without resorting to vulgarity.  If you want to talk about black crime, you don‚Äôt bring out a black to say what you want to say so you can hide behind him and say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the one who said it, not me!  Go get him!‚Äù  Tucker does this with every group. If he wants to talk about wamman, he brings out a wamman, if he wants to talk about blacks, he brings out a black. If wants to talk about whites, he brings out a Jew.Aside from this, Tucker is great. I appreciate having him. But Tucker is a bow-tie wearing true conservative. We cannot expect him to be something he is not.  I will be SHOCKED if he comes out on Monday and says he will NOT take part in cancel culture and either resign or force Fox News to re-hire the guy. If he does resign, I will still be suspicious.

                    That doesn‚Äôt negate my point. What I‚Äôm saying is that Carlson has two choices. He could tell Fox to blow it out their ass and resign, or he could recant his heretical views, apologize tearfully, and continue working at Fox as an emasculated cuck. Either way, Fox gets what it wants and the real Carlson, warts included, is gone.

                They‚Äôd be nuts to get rid of him. He‚Äôs a money maker. The trick will be in retaining him and his audience.Consider: from a marketing perspective Tuck is the only guy in the game. Cuck him out‚Ä¶ and any brand loyalty he has is gone. Worse, Fox becomes just another ‚Äúme too‚Äù network. (‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù does not mean in the marketing world what it does in Hollywood; a ‚Äúme too‚Äù product is one that every other competitor has. If you want to be a politically correct pozzed SJW network‚Ä¶ you instantly fall behind 6 or 8 other networks that have already been doing it for years.) Tuck is a gimmick that no other network has.If Tuck was smart, he‚Äôd give Fox the finger and bail out. He could retire on what he has or go solo and continue to work on his own in social media. Just looking at his history I don‚Äôt think he has the stones for that either‚Ä¶ but you never know.

                    Alas, as I always say, the AWRs, those at Fox included, put ideology before profit. It is one of their greatest strengths. Fox may well accept a hit in the pocketbook if it means obtaining a much greater measure of ideological purity.

        J. F.

The word ‚Äúrace‚Äù _has_ become so loaded with ideological baggage that another word‚Äìpopulation‚Äìis preferable when discussing genetics. Not to mention the substantive problems. You still think ‚ÄúCaucasian‚Äù is a useful category in the genomic era?‚Äùhttps://twitter.com/charlesmurray/status/1281688426761392128In the podcast he calls out Murray for his cuckery and explains in detail why we should not be giving up semantic ground to the Left.Gareipy is a genuine White dissident who was driven out of academia and is now living in hiding, somewhere in Northern Quebec.

                It‚Äôs the message and not the messenger.The ‚Äòweirdo‚Äô would no doubt point out that an Ad hominem does not discount his argument.With regard to giving up the word ‚Äòrace‚Äò to the Left, so that they can all now say that; ‚Äòrace‚Äò is an outdated concept that even the nazi scientist Charles Murray, has replaced with the more innocuous ‚Äòpopulations‚Äò.Please allow me to draw your attention to a personal bugbear of mine regarding the use of the word gender, which is a battle the Anglos may well have lost.In French, only a retard would use use ‚Äòle genre‚Äô as a synonym for ‚Äò le sexe ‚Äú. It‚Äôs the same in my native language Ukrainian; ‚Äò—Ä—ñ–¥‚Äô ( gender ) is not a synonym for ‚Äò—Å–µ–∫—Å ‚Äò( sex ).Sex is a biological term that describes the binary taxonomy of male and female with reference to dimorphism and meiosis.Gender is a grammatical term that refers to the categories into which nouns may be divided i.e. masculine , feminine and neuter.Please note the frequency of the use of the word gender on googles ngram viewer and correlate that to the career of the ghoul Dr. John Money, the advent of ‚Äú cultural stupidity studies ‚Äú in centres of higher indoctrination and it‚Äôs use by the media megaphone, where meat puppets reading the news, work from a script.https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=gender+&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgender%3B%2Cc0Not so long ago job applications and surveys would have a category box titled; ‚ÄúSex‚Äù, where you would check off or write in, male or female. It‚Äôs like everyone got a memo to use gender as a euphemism for sex but I suspect it was to escape the strict definition of sex as a binary and an act i.e. a man and a woman do not reproduce by having ‚Äò gender ‚Äò.The two words are not synonyms. When we use the word gender to refer to sex, it‚Äôs because our minds have been hacked.Words have meaning and power in the world. That is why the left redefines words that they find ‚Äò troublesome ‚Äò.The ‚Äú Gender ‚Äú spectrum should be the range of possible mental illnesses between men and women.After the war started, ‚Äú Words had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them.‚ÄùThucidides 3.82.4

                    Even most on the DR will casually use ‚Äúgender‚Äù instead of sex.  I would suggest that we begin pushing back with this (use ‚Äúsex‚Äù, not ‚Äúgender‚Äù).  I‚Äôve been trying to myself where I can.  We probably can‚Äôt reclaim all the old terms though.  Murray‚Äôs critique of the old racial terms is valid, as we know a lot more about human origins and races from genomic studies than when terms like ‚ÄúCaucasian‚Äù were first used.  This actually offers an opening for us.  All you would really need would be a few race aware geneticists or anthropologists with courage to coin new terms that could become a ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù for us.On the subject of dog whistles more broadly ‚Äì I‚Äôm more and more convinced that what the Marxists callpraxisin politics involves almost nothing else.  It‚Äôs just a contest of dog trainers with a variety of different whistles.  Once a trainer realizes that enough of the dogs are standing at attention with ears turned toward him, he whistles ‚Äúattack!‚Äù.  This initiates the ‚Äúkinetic‚Äù phase of events.

                        In 1994 the Political Scientist Charles Murray served as the gentile frontman for the Psychologist and bacon dodger, Richard J Hernstein, with whom he ‚Äòco-authored‚Äò a book to explain to the stupid goyim that, the reason that god‚Äôs darlings own and control most everything is because they‚Äôre overrepresented in ‚Äúthe cognitive elite‚Äù.On jew intelligence please see Vox Day‚Äôs article ‚Äú The myth of Jewish Intelligence ‚Äú.http://voxday.blogspot.com/2018/04/the-myth-of-jewish-intelligence.htmlTo which I would add, that even if the chinamen and nosebergs are smarter then us ‚Äì and they are not ‚Äì we still have the licence to pursue self-determination in the face of extinction, and don‚Äôt have to justify our existence to anyone !At present the narrative contrived by Murray and Hernstein, has proven to be a liability to the Bolsheviks and to Murray personally, who now wants to replace the word ‚ÄúRace‚Äú with the more innocuous word ‚Äòpopulation‚Äô.J F Gariepy tweeted Murray about the word ‚ÄúRace‚Äú. Murray responded by deflecting to the word ‚Äú Caucasian‚Äú which Gariepy did not mention. This sort of legerdemain or slight of hand is typical of a practiced shill.The reason that the word RACE is a problem for the Bolsheviks is because it carries an entirely different connotation than the word ‚Äòpopulation‚Äô.Being displaced and dispossessed by another ‚Äòpopulation‚Äô is easier to sell then being displaced by other RACES.I understand your use of the word praxis to mean the use of ‚ÄúKey Stimuli‚Äù which are environmental factors that initiate fixed action patterns. For instance a person walking in a forest hearing a rustling in bushes near to them, would make the inference of possible imminent danger and take action.By working to retire the word ‚Äòrace‚Äô, in favour of the word ‚Äòpopulation‚Äô, the cuck Murray, is replacing a biologically potent key stimulus, with a neutral stimulus, that will not alarm the cattle ( goyim) i.e. the neutral stimulus does not elicit the same response as the potent stimulus.‚ÄúHe who controls the language controls the masses.‚ÄùSaul Alinsky

        This is exactly why our sideis a joke. We have faceless entities like Zman expecting guys like Tucker to commit Seppuku to satisfy Z‚Äôs ego and desire for purity
Calrson is far from perfect, anyone with a brain can see that, but he is the only one even to dare to expose the Left/Globo-homo to the masses.And if Tucker did quit there is no place for him to go. Gab is a poorly organized shit pile. Oan is at best meh.

        The United States is a totalitarian dictatorship whether you want to admit it or not. This isn‚Äôt an issue of ‚Äúthe left‚Äù vs. ‚Äúthe right.‚Äù The neoliberal left controls the government, including the media, and it is now just as synonymous with the state as the Communist Party was with the Soviet Union. So, when you say it‚Äôs time to choose sides, those are your sides: Core Americans vs. the regime and its supporters.The neoliberal left can hire racists like Sarah Jeong at the NYT. They can have their reporters issue veiled racist threats on Twitter and get away with their comments while our side is doxxed for anonymous commentary, none of which are as severe as what these racists at the Times have said in recent years. If you work for NBC at the highest levels, they‚Äôll let you run a fake investigation of your connections with Harvey Weinstein and nothing will ever come of it. If you are a member of the inner party, ABC will spike an expose of your connection to Weinstein. The regime will even kill people like Jeffery Epstein to protect their lackeys or make the accusations go away (funny how that Lady G story all but disappeared from the internet, eh?). Or they‚Äôll rewrite Wikipedia to call you an ‚Äúalt-right, white supremacist‚Äù. They‚Äôve done exactly that over the past year to numerous people. Ann Coulter is now listed on that site as ‚Äúfar right‚Äù while that loon Keith ‚ÄúWe are At War with Russia, Russian Scum!‚Äù Olberman is just a sports commentator. But Tucker Carlson‚Äôs writer, he‚Äôll get fired.Tucker Carlson should lie to his employer about apologizing. Then, on live television, he should resign just as that RT reporter did years ago. He could slam the left and this unjust, racist government and advise his viewers to demand their state governments secede. He could ask President Trump to say the same thing as an FU on election night; they‚Äôve already announced they‚Äôll prosecute him for fake crimes when he leaves office.Why should we accept the result of an election stolen through mail-in ballots, immigration, and media censorship? We shouldn‚Äôt.Let‚Äôs be honest, geographical partition is the only way we can protect ourselves from racial violence, discrimination, and loss of freedom at this point. Unless you want to end up like the poor whites of South Africa, that is. Because that is definitely where things are going.‚ÄúHow his blasphemy was discovered is unknown‚ÄùThey either had someone inside the company alert the CNN doxxer or the NSA did it and forwarded it to a third party. If that‚Äôs not the case, then they would have reported their method (they have before), so they have something to hide. Like I said, totalitarian dictatorship.You either support freedom through secession or you support dictatorship through repression. The choice is that simple because there is no other choice ‚Ä¶ unless you want to endure the next 80 years of Marxist dictatorship like the Russians did or live on the margins of society as the South African Whites do now. Personally, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the ‚Äúlive through tyranny but have some kids‚Äù strategy. There isn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúTrumpslide‚Äù coming and Qanon is an obvious hoax. All the other objections are based on ignorance or cowardice.You guys who opposed separate countries were wrong and should come around now while you still have the chance. The window of free speech may very well be closed by this time next year. Or are you loyal to the same repressive system you complain about because you get cheap hamburgers during grilling season? If so, America is nothing but a department store and it deserves its fate.America is beyond reform. It‚Äôs long gone. Tucker Carlson promoted this fantasy on his show, but we now know that he was wrong. You‚Äôre not taking back America because the other side is the majority now. We aren‚Äôt having equality under the law. The other side has made that clear in California and by selectively prosecuting its enemies while letting criminals go free (as long as they are democrats); spin your tires on a racist BLM slogan painted on the street by the state and you are guilty of a hatecrime but deface our monuments with hate in your heart and you get away with it.The republican party won‚Äôt be reformed. They are corrupt imbeciles elected by a voting base of old grannies whose politics come from the early 80s. The democrats won‚Äôt moderate. They are evil and are getting more evil by the day. The state will soon go Marxist and that vaunted military of yours will fall into enemy hands. It will certainly be used against your interests. Check out Rod Dreher‚Äôs coverage of Woke Point. Scary.Why should we be loyal to a country that is not loyal to us? Why should our side be killed in a war the other side starts with Russia and China? No Chinese, no Russian, has ever called me deplorable. Why should we have to tolerate racist insults? Why should we be driven out of media, business, finance, law, and other professional jobs just because we are White? And why should we be forced to pay taxes to a regime that does that? Why do we have to pay their bills but also have to suffer their complaints? Why are we silenced from having opinions ‚Äî our social media and bank accounts shut down? How is this still a free country if they are?There are countless offenses. Honestly, what in theDeclaration of Independenceis worse than the grievances we have suffered in our lifetimes? And what does that tell you about what our next course of action should be?We are the real America. Not the other side. So this is not treason. We are loyal to ourselves and to the original intent of our forefathers. The other side? They are the children of peoples we didn‚Äôt invite to our shores, and they work to undo the freedoms our ancestors gave us. They hate us, they oppress us. The will continue doing so. We, our people, are the true spirit of 1776. Our ancestors are calling for action. Don‚Äôt you hear it? Listen and you might. Freedom is ringing in a land of our taking ‚Äî our own. We just have to reach for it and there it will be.

            On another unrelated note, it looks like BLM has graduated to burning down churches (three in the last couple of days), plus a white mom was shot by BLM after she said ‚Äúall lives matter.‚ÄùBLM and antifa are shock troops for state and corporate-sanctioned diffuse terror, like the diffuse terror Ukrainian peasants faced in the Holodomor.

        AA on D@1ly St0rm3r had a piece that covered how the writer got snagged, and it comes down to being unwise in your shitposting.If you‚Äôre in a position of influence, as this guy was, stop throwing slurs around the internet ‚Äì there is no benefit to it. If you‚Äôre so addicted that you have to do so then don‚Äôt reveal ANYTHING about yourself.Occasionally patrons of this site will storm on about how we should all be saying n***er b/c if we don‚Äôt we‚Äôre cowed and not actually free or something to that effect. It seems like these are usually elderly guys with most of their working life behind them. There is no benefit to using slurs online, especially if you‚Äôre young. We don‚Äôt know what kind of capacity there will be in future to trace online ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù. Be wise, clean up your shitposting. It‚Äôs your duty to make yourself as useful to our cause for as long as you can, and getting busted for an online slur, as this writer did, is an inexcusably stupid waste of potential.

        Most Christians I know worship social media more than God. Matthew 6:21, I believe.We are stuck getting drunk on their stupid gadgets. And through our obsessiveness with them, we invite their influence into our homes and grant them monopoly over our thoughts.The ubiquity of smartphones and social media has drastically curtailed our attention spans; indeed, the very structure of our brains has been alarmingly altered. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the slow withdrawal of testosterone in younger Gen X, Millennial and Zoomer men.It‚Äôs ironic that the left is so caught up in biological denialism. In reality, they‚Äôve been commodifying and weaponizing our neurologies and biologies for decades. Part of what‚Äôs weakening us are the tools they claim will make us stronger.We need to throw out social media. It teaches us to value the wrong things. And we need to throw out our smartphones, too. They corrupt our attention. Back to a rural life, away from the cities, and throw out the devil‚Äôs tools.

            I‚Äôm mostly in the same school of thought, as it were, as you, LankyI definitely see a connection between urban living among whites and their total cuckery, loss of spirit and soul, and ability to form an honest assessment and appreciation of the times and the racesSomething about being among and around nature and seeing the interactions of animals and taking the time to stare at the stars  that brings honesty and wisdom and reflection.  Granted, there are always negative aspects too. But we definitely need to get back to nature if we are to get our strength and sanity back, at least for the time being

            That‚Äôs fine, but do you want to live in a world where a moment of humorous candor means your life is ruined? If the only way to have a life is to be a humorless drone assiduously adhering to the morality of the Left, it is time to break out the dynamite vests.

                                    Not my argument or aimed at me but its a good place to say this.Our job is to understand that we are trying to find a way to prevent an actual civil war.Folks who have seen the proverbial elephant or at least have listened to those that have have some idea how bad this would be.I don‚Äôt blame anyone for not starting something that comes down to collective punishment for three generations and three rings of association , primary targeting of soft targets and every cruelty and atrocity minds wrought with hate can manage.WRSA calls this Bosnia X Rwanda and as much of us want a society that fracking  makes sense and is good for our people , we aren‚Äôt to where the price is worth paying.

The guy was an effective writer because he was hanging around this milieu.  The fact is, all our identities are sitting in a database awaiting a simply query.  I follow this guy southern Dingo.  Hillbilly as hell.  Lost his first job when he commented on FB about a grown sheboon beating up a white teen girl at the local fair.  Lost his second job when he was pictured in charlottesville.  does his podcast on a 200$ walmart notebook special.  Guy is entertaining as hell and getting very very savvy. I rather have 1 of this guy than 15 retired boomers talking shit about their cold dead hands.Your point about grey men is taken, but not well.

                        I‚Äôve known at least one person personally who had reached some level of authority/power in the new government under the Trump administration‚Äîwhich they lost because they simply did not keep their mouths shut and do their work, i.e., to undermine/reverse Obama administration rules and regulations in a cabin level department.Rather they did exactly what this writer did, amused themselves to no effect in a public forum. They were outed, fired, and now no longer have such a position within which to operate.Smart people choose the mountain they want to die on. But I suppose you prefer some sort of nihilist virtue signaling to effective counter revolution.

                            nihilist, not sure where you got that?Comp,you are probaly correct, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I gotta like it. We are still a majority. Whites should be encouraged to speak their minds. If enough did, many of the techniques being used against us would rapidly become ineffective. It‚Äôs a fine line between being crafty and being cowardly. I‚Äôm surround by tenured faculty that are afraid of their own shadows. Zman, to his credit, is highly reluctant to get young guys in trouble. But the fact remains that we need cannon fodder if this war is to be won. Finally, a man‚Äôs dignity is worth something.

        An observation, hopefully too paranoid: this latest example of Badwhite fired for soemthing totally unrelated to his job. How was he even identified, if he was using a pseudonym? That bears investigation. Violating privacy is sometimes a criminal act; yet how often have you ever heard of charges, much less convictions for that? Another thing this shows is the utter expendability of virtually any type of employee. Hardly a new problem, but putting the blame on a subordinate is the oldest trick in the book, probably because it works so well. This is another (paranoid) survival thought to keep in mind, as an employee in nearly any type of organization. It sounds cyncial, but they‚Äôll sacrifice you at first need.We here should always keep in mind the risks we run even debating things here. While we‚Äôre not doing anything criminal (‚Äúso far‚Äù) there is clear risk to careers etc. were our real names to get loose. So use of alias, hard-to-trace emails, etc. is called for. I give Z-man enough faiith that he won‚Äôt doxx us, but anyone can be hacked this days and another outing happens‚Ä¶ Speaking for myself, I too prefer anonymity, but risks to my professional or social standing are pretty much limited to being kicked off the administration of the local AA group üòÄ

            I‚Äôm screwed then b/c my email is tied to my mac.com account and there are only so many of those and they are kind of ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù according to people b/c they are no longer being given out and date to a time when Apple charged people for them
I also noticed that when I use a VPN on this site that it sometimes will not let things refresh or post.
Any solutions or suggests Should I get a gmail account?

            I do have a humble suggestion to this effect for the Z-man, for a method I‚Äôve seen other bloggers, forums and news sites use: automatic wiping and closing of comments on each post after a set period, say 1 or 2 months.When I read a new Z-blog post I usually go to the comments to see how readers are reacting, but if I reread old posts from years ago I rarely continue down into the ancient comments: why should I get buried in old fads, arguments and poorly-aged assumptions?Automatic wiping of comments for each post after a couple months allows old shitposts, dumb infighting, trolling, and other marginal comments to be wiped clean. Any good comments are mostly valuable for their initial, here-and-now insights they provided when Z-man first published the post, and there‚Äôs no particular value in letting those stick around either.I don‚Äôt know how easy this would be to set up technically, but it‚Äôs one potential way to clear out any archive of crimethink.By the way, Z-man, I like your decision to disable the voting on comments. So far this seems to have reduced infighting and petty parochialism.

            If you can be doxxed with your IP you‚Äôre already doing dissidence wrong.  Everyone here should be using a VPN and using burner email addresses like proton.
Here‚Äôs a decent primer on making anonymous payments.
https://www.cogipas.com/anonymous-online-payments-explained-how-to-pay-anonymously/
Note with Bitcoin avoid Coinbase and other front-end cash loaders that leave breadcrumbs back to your meatspace identity.  Load your Bitcoin wallet with gift cards or cash/Bitcoin ATM.  Bespoke security = a hardware wallet as well. The above article mentions this but downplays the front-end risk, IMO.

                        The following summarizes Hannity, and is why I stopped watching him.Hannity actually did an admirable job of allowing onto this show various people who exposed the failed coup attempt against Trump. It is damned well probable Fox and the rest of Conservatism, Inc., wanted him skinned alive for revealing to the public the depths to which the Deep State has plunged.Yet when it comes time for Congress to reauthorize domestic surveillance on citizens, what does Hannity do? Endorses renewing these ‚Äútools to fight terror.‚Äù The cucking idiot had spent years showing how these procedures had been exploited to nearly overturn an election and had destroyed lives.Soon as those words flew out of his ignorant mouth, I stopped watching completely.

        In the end, this revolution will end up where all revolutions end. Everyone will be forced to choose sides and give over their life to the cause they choose.The people living in mansionswill find the choice easy. Every day they are reminded of how well the revolution is treating them.Far too many whites are short sighted and ill informed on how to analyze situations. Real economics teaches how to think and you don‚Äôt need a lot of numbers for that. (that is fiance)Henry Hazlitt:The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.The immediate effect might be that going along with the evil non-whites will save their ass for a while, but like Tucker‚Äôs writer the mob will get around to them at some point.Further, the common blacks themselves will be in deep trouble once the rulers are done with using them and show them what they truly think of them.

        HMMMM.Not bad,all things considered. Tucker came up with a very measured but also combative commentary. This from a quick media report on Monday night:Carlson said of Neff‚Äôs commentary: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt endorse those words. They have no connection to the show. It is wrong to attack people for qualities they cannot control. In this country, we judge people for what they do, not for how they were born. We often say that because we mean it. We‚Äôll continue to defend that principle, often alone among national news programs, because it is essential. Nothing is more important. Blake fell short of that standard and he has paid a very heavy price for it.‚ÄùHe then went after those he perceives as taking delight in Neff‚Äôs downfall.‚ÄúWe should also point out to the ghouls now beating their chests in triumph at the destruction of a young man, that self-righteousness also has its costs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all human. When we pretend we are holy, we are lying. When we pose as blameless in order to hurt other people, we are committing the greatest sin of all and we will be punished for it.‚ÄúGiven the circumstances, Tucker comes off as pretty resolute; there is an implicit ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the MSM and other SJW scum in his words. I give him an 80% on it.

                Brief, but agreed it was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù what Neff posted.  The exact moral high ground that z, correctly, identifies as the key thing you cannot concede.  Tuck concedes, and the belated ‚Äúthe other side is also terrible‚Äù coda won‚Äôt make up for it.Not even close.I don‚Äôt see why he ‚Äúhad‚Äù to anyway. Fox needs tucker more than tucker needs them.  It‚Äôs like Twitter, ‚Äúright wing‚Äù people using it gives it legitimacy.   Tucker gives fox legitimacy.Leave.  Don‚Äôt accept their rules.  This applies to voting too I think these days.  Whatever needs to be done, it won‚Äôt come from engaging with mainstream politics in any way I think.

        If Carlson caves as predicted, life goes on as normal. If he throws Fox under the bus, takes the completely opposite approach, defends his guy and his freedoms to the hilt, he will be president in 2025.The odds are on the former.  But it can‚Äôt be predicted with any certainty, because ifanyonewould do such a thing (and there‚Äôs hardly anyone), it would be Carlson.

        Z raises an interesting point. The wealthy will never ultimately be on our side. Life is too cushy for them and they are too interconnected with people who want to destroy us. The only exception I can come up with is possibly ann Coulter would choose sides even if it meant her career. She was already hated on the left and has been willing to be hated by many on the right for attacking Trump for conning us.That said, Tucker does a lot of good work especially in giving whites permission to be angry both about anti white jihad and about our supposed leaders. He is painting, what for the mainstream, is a clear picture for the mainstream, of what our overlords have planned for us. No one else I know of in the mainstream data to do that.But, yeah, life is sweet for Tucker and he will likely throw his now ex writer under the bus and learn the lesson of never highlighting Jewish terrorists again

        The explosion of hysteria over ‚Äúracism‚Äù is something remarkable, something I never thought would be possible in an industrialized society and more akin to the hysterias and manias you‚Äôd see in the Middle Ages.While I‚Äôm convinced many at the top are deliberately ginning up hysteria over things they know are false, it really does seem like the footsoldiers believe this shit. In recent days we‚Äôve seen Portland rioters try to burn down a building because they thought they saw an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù hand symbol in the window (and so what if it had been?!), HBCU alums freaking out over fake nooses that turned out to be door pulls, tow lines or exercise equipment, and USA Today ‚Äújournalists‚Äù convinced that the eagle on the latest Trump t-shirt is a Nazi eagle.The hysteria is breathtaking, and it‚Äôs probably only a matter of months before we devolve into shit like this:We really are heading into a new Dark Age, aren‚Äôt we?

There does seem to be a demand from some quarters that Tucker give a ZOG speech and then be fired or quit. Somehow this will solve everything.

            Don‚Äôt you, however, sense in all of this the staleness of a reenactment, a ‚Äúbeen there, done that‚Äù quality?  Zman touched on this previously.We are all known quantities, just that we have been rearranged into shared living arrangements, and these arrangements are what‚Äôs new.  Mexicans and their sensibilities and habits, Asians, blacks, whites, Jews, Muslims.  All of us are known.  We have all been studied to death.  If we were chess pieces, we would all be assigned to a certain piece; each piece is only allowed a certain movement on the chessboard.  Perhaps we are knights, the L movements creating something of lack of predictability.I just get the feeling this is an old game still being played but with a new set of pieces.  Or refurbished pieces.  Part of me KNOWS I am being manipulated to perform the role of my piece.  Or do we decide not to play?

        I would say. Let‚Äôs see what Tucker does. I was in a room with Tucker giving a public speech over a year ago and before the current craziness.  Tucker criticized Trump and mentioned Goldman Sachs by name as a problem with Trump.That was going further to address the elite problem we got by any other fellow elite that I have heard speak at a microphone at a public event.We shall see? We need a guy like Tucker to move normies our way in my opinion.But I concede that I could be wrong about that.

            that‚Äôs his personal wealth that he would, for example, report to Uncle SamYou can‚Äôt look at people like him from wealthy families as individuals because there is all kinds of hidden family money he can fall back on, land holdings, etcMy good friend‚Äôs grandfather was a governor in the 1950s early 1960s and they were able to ride that into all sorts of land holdings and so forth that no one knows about but that he can always tap into.  Not to mention connections, their kids still put into powerful positions, banker friends still hanging around, etc.  Once you reach a certain level, you can ride it for a few generations.

        Zman: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to see what Carlson has to say about it, but unless he dramatically resigns on-air, the one thing we can know for sure is that when the choice is between his friends on the Left and the people who watch his show, he will pick his friends.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs like, your syllogism, man. Too either/or for me.  Tucker insightfully redpills the nation about elite intentions from something of a D-Right perspective.  This is important and rare in MSM.  I don‚Äôt want to see him resign over a writer‚Äôs joke.  And I don‚Äôt care how wealthy he is.  That‚Äôs a low jab.  He‚Äôs obviously not the type to be content with fly-fishing.  His is a 24/7 endeavor.  He‚Äôs worked hard to get and stay where he is.  He surely works harder than Zman or any of us.  I can say that because Z does enjoy taking shots at people.

            To me it seems the woke tribe got a jump on him. If he does not stand up for his back stager who was just purged, he is acting cucked. Other than demand the man is rehired or Tucker goes, I dont see what he can do. Except keep his six figure pay check and roll on like nothing happened. But then the ‚Äòmost extreme‚Äô will see him for what he is, a presstitude.

                    What? Naive.  Even Lincoln had to work his way through several generals.  Greg Johnson is many things but not a general.

                    With all due respect to Zman, he of the smooth voice and quick wit; Tucker has a bigger platform/wider reach from his perch at Fox. No man is perfect, so if he fails to defend his writer for selfish reasons that moral lapse would be regrettable. Still, Tucker is a modern Cicero; and I‚Äôd prefer not to see his hands nailed up in the Forum. Martyrdom in an age of unbelief is a false witness of anything but futility.

        Tucker is a freemason, guaranteed, and, therefore, controlled opposition. Why do you think he lamented the Albert Pike statues being taken down on his show, not once but twice? The way they work I wouldnt doubt this being a set up, with Tucker totally in on the game.  They know millions see Tucker as their only voice in the mainstream, so now is the time to demoralize these people.  Tucker will cave, big time.   Again, if you view all of this without even the slightest notion of hardcore Christian eschatology, you are getting only a piece of the puzzle. Z, for all the great work he does, sees a large part of this hellscape, but can‚Äôt see the whole thing. This is it: the erasure of whites, open borders, vaccines (which will be the mark, or getting people ready for the mark) one world government, and the reing of the antichrist ruling from Jerusalem over his judeo-masonic empire. I could go on but why bother? Life is not going back to normal; in fact, it is going to get more insane till the end.  The only political solution is getting right with the Lord, praying fervently to Him and his mother and to the saints, and try not to hate anyone, for as William Saroyan said ‚ÄúAll are evil.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.‚Äù Luke 14: 27.

But the is the nature of the moment
And when it comes down to it, faith in something larger than us is our only true guide.  Because of the Zman and his links to other sites, I have acquainted myself with the guys over at Counter Currents, and they over there are big on a theorist, Julius Evola, and that is his central idea.  It sits well with me because it is something I have always sensed, albeit more inchoately
