        The Roman Elite at least tried to learn from their mistakes. (Machiavelli wrote a great book on this topic). Our elite haven’t wised up yet. The Jewish Elite, as usual too clever for their own good, imported an army of savages who will ultimately ghetto-ize them. The Techbro Elite were astonished to see some cholo with a Mexican flag dancing on the wreckage of their autonomous Waymo taxi yesterday. They forgot that all their whiz-bang technology, and wealth, depend on actual White guys maintaining civilization. If our elite wise up quickly, we have a chance. Otherwise, the Barbarians are at the gates….

        ‘Some qualities are disqualifying, as the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein learned. He was very good at making profitable films, a highly prized quality, but he had habits that were eventually disqualifying’Ole Harv went quid pro quo with the young chickies who coveted movie roles and other goodies. A transaction. Sheeit, Harvey is probably a moderate when it comes to Hollywood morality.  At least he wasn’t a homo.  And what about the ‘habits’ of the females using him? Why are they not disqualifying?Harvey’s habits were absolutely fine until the day that the Sisterhood decided to kick off $MeToo as the latest shakedown to fleece American men. He was not ‘disqualified’ until his use to the young women — and to the gynarchy — had passed.Harvey was selected to kick off the grift precisely because he appeared as a lumbering, ugly ogre . . . exactly the image the Sisterhood wished to inject into the minds of the sheeple to begin their latest pogrom. From there it was all downhill.

            Yep. Good call. Really, Harvey was an honest businessman. His budding “starlets” got what they “paid” for. No different than a whore/john transaction on the street. Not my morality to be sure, but not what Harvey was later pictured as.

                It was more than a financial grift, too. The Left wanted Kickass Girlboss movies, and Harv was old-school, into making good films not ideological lectures.
That had to go. Old, white, male, with power. Had to be taken down to inaugurate the Girlboss Era.  Voila, sex accusations.
The moment that the Almighty Ones decide you are a criminal, guess what? You are.

                    Honestly shocked anyone here still thinks Harvey WEINSTEIN is white.  I mean in the literal sense that his skin resembled a mottled white toad, yeah, but there are albinos in africa with “white” skin who everyone knows arent white.  Why are we still letting them do the “hello fellow whites” thing whenever one of them manages to get in enough trouble to break their usual protective shield.

            The casting couch was around long before HW. One of the big perks for the Jews who ran Hollywood was access to all those beautiful 𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘬𝘴𝘢𝘴 who wanted to be stars. David Niven observed that every beauty contest winner in the USA went to Hollywood. Few became stars but many became casting couch occupants.

            Gavin Newsom’s Jewish wife slept with Harvey. Years later she claimed it was “rape”… but she never called the cops at the time it allegedly happened, LOL.

                    I’m sure Harv was one of many. She’s a former “Republican” married to a Democrat governor… a whore in every way, it sounds like:

        Demographics. Demographics. Demographics.
What is unfolding in California is the future of the West if the present trajectory continues. The elite have noticed. They can be rewarded by the system if bold action is taken, or they can lose everything, which as you rightly note is always a concern for them, and have their wealth distributed to the brown and black and yellow hordes.
Their choice.

            California is officially 34% White (which includes X% of Jews and Arabs).  Texas is officially 39.6% White (with its own overlarge share of Jews and Arabs).  New York state is 54%.  Illinois is 58.8%.  Montana is 85.1%.  Missouri is 77.9%.  No state is where it ought to be, but there are definitely better and worse.

                    Some/most is already gone. White enclaves are possible and I think likely but will have to be policed because those responsible are…white, actually white.

                    Yep, and it is even worse.  Your stat’s are for entire States—not cities.  The large cities in most any of the States is demographically worse.  For example, the city of my birth, NYC, is now less than 30% White.  When I was born there in 1953, Whites were 90%, and at that NYC was then considered very “cosmopolitan “.  Any doubt why NYC is dysfunctional?  Any doubt why the populace of LA are happy to take to the streets and burn the place down?Any future conflict between Whites and “others” will be synonymous with rural vs urban.  This is actually an advantage.  Better to be rural than urban.  The typical large city is so dependent upon the uninterrupted influx of food and energy that disruption of such for even a few days will cause massive casualties not seen since the days of the Black Plague.

                        Yes. Note also that NYC and like cities have enormous gibs as incentives for the savages to migrate there. States that do not participate in Medicaid expansion, to give an example, over time have less influx.

                        Greta is kidnapped by no one.  Look, aside from her being a mental case, she is a Spiteful Mutant.  Her gig in Climate Change got old, so now she’s hooked onto a new one—Palestinians and their cause.  She has no values, only venues she works to her own aggrandizement.  She is best ignored, rather than repeatedly having her latest photo opt reprinted here.  Sigh….

Perhaps the j00z will use her as a secret weapon and send here there to talk the Palis to death about their carbon footprint. Eventually they will beg for mercy – “take that thing back and go back to sending glide-bombs!”

                    I’m not saying this to be a doomer, but sorting is impossible when you have a federal government looking at maps and models and determining the best way to dump tens of thousands of Haitians into White neighborhoods. It’s impossible when you look at the boom cities of these majority-White states and fidn they are loaded with shitlibs who put up “In this house we believe…” signs, donate money to HIAS, and agitate for public transportation and sanctuary city status. The most amount of BLM signs I ever saw was in Vermont, and New Hampshire is full of bureaucrats trying to figure out how to best “diversify” their state.

                        The sorting is happening despite all that, though. States and localities that have limited gibs do not sustain the Colony Ridge occupations over time; the savages tend to migrate into leftwing cities over time.
As for Vermont and New Hampshire, dump a few bus loads of Somalis in them and those attitudes will be less in vogue.

                            Didn’t that happen in Maine? As far as I know, the locals there did not take steps to stop future busloads from coming. When did the busloads stop coming in Minnesota?
The fact is that 30-40% of White people are total shitlibs who hate White people (the heatmap). The diversity is a blessing to them and the opposition to it reinforces their hatred.
The hatred that White people have for White people is something that needs to be taken care of.

                                I don’t know about Maine, but many Minnesotans voted with their feet, often going next door to Wisconsin. I totally agree white self-hatred is the biggest problem of all and hope it is as low as 30-40 percent. Younger Americans have much less self-hatred than the Millennials upwards.

                                        Not always. It appears to have manifested in earnest immediately after WWII. Leftist intellectuals used both world wars and the West’s history of global imperialism as weapons to indict the white race. Beginning as early as the late 60s, those intellectuals began conquering the West’s institutions in order to promulgate their treasonous self-loathing. The project succeeded far beyond their wildest hopes.

                                            Correct. WWII was an enormous turning point for the Left. Prior to World War II, white elites were almost uniformly racist and white supremacist, including the Left. Marx despised nonwhite lumpenproletariat. Margaret Sanger promoted birth control to eliminate the inferior races. Eugenics was promoted by white elites on both sides of the Atlantic.The U.S. fought WWII with a racially segregated Army, and it was common to refer to Japanese in racially derogatory terms like “slant-eyed yellow bastards.”Starting with the Nuremberg trials, though, the U.S. needed to fabricate apost hocjustification for going to war against Germany, and Evil Mustache Man’s racial policies provided the perfect retroactive moral justification for things like massacring children at Dresden.This interview with George Lincoln Rockwell is fascinating, because much of what he says would have been seen as plain common sense to most white Americans prior to 1940. By 1965, you had to be a “Nazi” to say it:George Lincoln Rockwell on Canadian TV 1965In fairness, the World Wars did make it much harder to make the case for white supremacy. It was easy to deride naked brown spear-chuckers in the 19th century. By 1950 those savages looked pretty benign compared to the tens of millions slaughtered by “civilized” white countries in fratricidal white wars using modern, industrial, white technology.

                                                    But having the means is a big part of the Leftist indictment of white society. That’s why they’re “anti-” so many modern technologies: anti-nuclear, anti-fossil fuel, anti-internal combustion engine, anti-gun.
Of course… they’re pro-white technology when it suits them: pro-birth control, pro-abortion, pro-AIDS treatments, pro-covid vaxx, etc.
So they’re entirely inconsistent.

There is nothing remotely intellectually respectable about Leftism. But then again, how could a morally bankrupt people produce an ideology that is anything but beneath contempt?

                                                    It’s a valid point. Certainly Hitler’s biggest mistake and his dumbest decision. Until Pearl Harbor, the American public was overwhelmingly against getting into the war. Roosevelt had badly wanted to get into the war much earlier but public opinion wouldn’t let him do it. But he used every trick he could to assist the British.Pearl was attacked by the Japanese, of course, not the Germans. Hitler played right into Roosevelt’s hands by stupidly declaring war against a country he had no real ability to fight, let alone conquer. Of course Roosevelt used this paper declaration to engage and conquer Germany first, while Japan was a second priority.The point is that Germany was never a real threat to the U.S. in either of the world wars. Wilson famously claimed he was declaring war on Germany (not the other way around, mind you) to “make the world safe for democracy.” But Germany hadneverthreatened “democracy.” There is no official German statement or policy that they were engaged in a war against democracy. Germany was a constitutional monarchy, just like our ally England. So it was total bullshit.

Four days ago (June 6) I was reading all the blather about the heroes who died defending our freedom, and I wanted to say “No disrespect to the military whatsoever, but anyone who died at Normandy was not defending OUR freedom.”

                                            It may be that it’s some odd form of intellectual “peacocking”. There’s an idea among evolutionary biologists that animals like the Peacock actually have traits that areharmfulto them as a way of showing off to potential mates and rivals just how awesome they are. It may be that Whites, collectively, will display an intellectual form of this especially when, ironically, they are collected together in places where they are the overwhelming majority. So this could explain Vermont, Minnesota, and of course places like Portland (both OR and Maine).

                                            But only a handful of of the most radical abolitionists, like Harriet Beecher Stowe, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Helen Pitts Douglass (the white woman from Upstate New York who married the Frederick Douglass) were negro-worshippers.The vast majority of white people who found slavery to be distasteful at best and morally repugnant at worst still believed in the superiority of the white race. Lincoln himself said he believed the Negro was inferior and believed only in the legal, but not social, equality of the races.This is why segregation existed for nearly a century the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, and why making jokes about blacks or doing blackface comedy skits was considered acceptable right up until the 1950s or so.

                                                Slavery was outlawed in England in the 1200’s, I’ve not seen a convincing explanation as to how it surfaced in the US.

                                        Unfortunately, yes. During the early years of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Captain John Smith had a constant problem with an English official (whose name escapes me for the moment) who could have been a stand-in for that scumbag senator from Maryland who demanded that his crush be brought back from prison in El Salvador.This guy was constantly berating Smith for asking for more soldiers because of the constant fighting with the Indians. He blamed everything on Smith, saying that Smith was not doing enough to accomodate the Indians and after arriving in the colony, commandeered Smith’s men and forced them to build a grand house for the chief of the tribe that Smith was at odds with.The official made a big deal out of bringing the chief and many of his warriors to what was essentially a gifting ceremony, only to have the chief grab him and murder him in a very slow and gruesome manner. VDare had an in-depth article about it, if you can find it.

                                Oh yeah, it started in Maine. The Blackhawk Down Somalis were clustered in Atlanta; a few somehow got to Newport, Maine- the whitest of white, with an environment entirely alien to Saharan sensibilites- and found the gibs were better.
They started calling their relatives in hot Georgia, and more somehow made it north. Then temp hiring programs started in Michigan, across to Minnesota and Nebraska, I watched it spread across the top.A floor boss at Electrolux told me his factory used to be all Swedes, but now were people who literally did not know how to use a broom.

                                    Some years ago, my then-boss at work hired a bunch of Somalis as labourers, since the Trudeau government was promising a 50% kickback on wages to any business that would hire these people. I’ll always remember one of my coworkers storming into the break room shortly after and fuming that he could not work with people who couldn’t figure out how to operate a hammer.

                        It’s much more possible–not necessarily likely, mind you–now than it was before since many of the elites seem to have experienced a demographic epiphany. Again, I’m not necessarily expecting this to hold, but I feel slightly less awful about the future now than I did a year ago.

                A lot of that 34% in Cali is old legacy whites such as yours truly. The kids here are overwhelmingly non-white. The local high school, which was once known as the “rich kids on the hill” when I was a kid is now 60% non-white (about 40% Hispanic). It used to be an academic powerhouse but is now a Title II school (receiving extra resources to improve academic outcomes, i.e., the kids are failing).

            Best to look at birth statistics. You’d be surprised by some of the states that are near or below 50% white. Lily white Massachusetts is only 54% white and 24% Hispanic. Washington state is 52% with 11% Hispanic. Hispanic births outnumber white births in Arizona, same for Texas and California.
Even Oregon births are 23% Hispanic.

                Yes. The stats often are shocking. Alabama–with its huge black population–will be majority white long after Massachusetts, to give one example. I expect there to be a lot of intra-state racial friction before anything happens nationwide.

                    Early exposure to blacks inoculates Southern Whites against the whole brown rainbow. If current trends hold (I doubt they actually will because the country is headed for a crack-up) you’ll have those silly Fudds and prairie home companions in the upper Midwest trying to stop Sharia law from taking effect while the deep South stays at 80/20 White/Black.

        I think Musk realized that the DOGE thing was used by the GOP as a publicity stunt and they had no intention of really executing the cuts. Had he had not been a druggie, he would have chalked it up to experience, shut his mouth, and gone back to his businesses a sadder but wiser man. Trump will not be successful unless he decides to ignore the courts who are attempting to hamstring him. Court decisions are in essence advisory, since the courts cannot enforce their decisions. The only recourse for a president who ignores court decisions is impeachment and conviction by Congress, which will not happen. He has been handed a golden opportunity to crush his enemies by the situation in California, with violent mobs attacking federal officers while waving foreign flags. Disperse the mobs with deadly force if necessary, arrest the authorities encouraging them and go after the people financing them. There is an organization in California called CHIRLA (The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights) that is state funded and in turn finances these mobs. Arrest their officers.

                    I will admit the same thought crossed my mind.  My patience is 0 with these traitors, criminals and invaders.  And their paymasters.To cross your bridge, tho, you’d need a president and other allied forces prepared either to initiate martial law, or at minimum prepared to go to war on related domestic targets, in case the Left struck back.And that’s a narrow, dangerous bridge.  OTOH, I agree 100 percent that if Donald really wants to stop this b.s. for the long, hot summer ahead, a severe first-strike is the way to go.  I’d go something less-than-lethal for the first assault, then increasingly severe measures for the insistent.I’d want my backup ducks lined up in CA before I took these types of confrontational steps.

                        Another possibility is to expell California from the nation. I don’t know if that is legally possible, but something tells me California wouldn’t resist too hard. They’ve acted like they’ve wanted to secede for quite some time, and my motto is to support secession everywhere and at all times.

        what is really interesting, is the blob is bringing in 3rd worlders from all over.  none of which have any affinity for the others.  we already see competing groups rioting against each other, here in the US.  it’s easy to lump them all in together, but they are not going to cooperate much.  good example is mexicans vs other latins, or mexicans vs nigs.  we are like a big ole fireworks warehouse, with a night watchman who smokes.

            You’re right, and that’s why the system here puts so much effort into preventing real leaders from gaining prominence.  As Z-man mentioned, our system rewards the bad and punishes the good.

        The sacrifice of Weinstein served the purpose of kicking off the metoo movement which has made heterosexual relationships defacto illegal for straight men. It gave women a victim switch they can flip at any time to use their newfound prosecutorial abilities to enforce that paradigm shift which many have predictably used that created the chilling effect outcome they wanted. He was perfect for that role since he’s not at all sympathetic &amp; wasn’t subtle about his antics in the slightest.A better example is Andrew Cuomo, he did everything right in the eyes of the system &amp; had insanely good optics within that realm but got sacrificed anyway because he represented the old masculine leadership the system despises. Its not a coincidence they put an insufferable harpy &amp; authoritarian boss mommy figure like Kathy Hochul in his place, that’s the system’s ideal archetype.

                It was the final nail in the coffin of birthrates for intelligent, non impulsive &amp; risk averse people. It was bad enough that marriage essentially entailed any potential wife forever held a loaded gun to your head that when the trigger was pulled meant she’d get half of everything you ever worked for, you becoming an indentured servant &amp; free reign to turn your kids into trannies. They already destroyed marriage &amp; with this move they preemptively still-birthed the precursor to it.

            No he was let go because the heat was getting to hot on investigating his murder of countless old people by putting covid infected people in nursing homes. Weinstein was just low hanging fruit. His movie might not have been making money anymore, or perhaps his politics never jived with the rest of his “class” and they just needed an excuse to take him down. No honor among thieves

                Nobody was ever prosecuted for anything related to the covid crimes &amp; all those people involved still deny he did anything wrong. Also, if he really was sacrificed for that reason to appease people there was absolutely nothing stopping them from prosecuting him after he left office. You become less immune to criminal prosecution when you lose political power, not more. He also bitterly resisted his ouster the same way his brother did who was sacked from mainstream media for the same reason.The idea that Cuomo had to be publicly painted as a sexual deviant &amp; removed as governor to save him from prosecution from crimes that were in the same wheelhouse as those being committed in virtually every state in the country while those politicians &amp; medical officials walked away totally unscathed doesn’t hold water for me at all. The threat of prosecution was what that ultimately made him concede &amp; step down after he resisted but wasn’t the underlying motivation for canceling him in the first place.

                    It was used to remove him from the attention.  He didn’t go to prison for his me too stuff like Harvey, which shows you right off the bat that it was two totally different things.  And yes i’m quite aware no one has been held accountable for the FUBAR that was covid.  Also if Meatball was cancelled he wouldn’t be running for mayor of NYC currently, and would be in prison, like Harvey.

He’s currently awaiting trial in Rikers prison. They showed him no mercy unlike Cuomo.

                            Cuomo was part of the Atlantic in-group.  Harvey was not.Mostly, Harvey was used to initiate $MeToo, and as a symbol of the domestic terrorism that would rain down on any male that the gynarchy chose likewise to target.The grrls were especially enraged at Harv because — unlike the prettyboy actors and wannabes they usually boinked — Harvey was butt ugly.Quid pro quo sex with a man looking like Harvey produces rage and vengeance in females.  They thirsted to use him, but the sex was degrading . . . not because of the sex itself, but because of Harvey’s appearance.His ugliness confirmed to the grrls that they were, in fact, prostituting themselves at the lowest level.  This, of course, could neither be faced nor admitted, so a scapegoat male needed to be found and punished.This is why Harvey is being tortured in a cage.  And nowadays they can do it to pretty much any male they wish.  Nice going, folks.

                His “murder of old people” only occurred if you buy into the the false epidemiological narrative that Dr Fauci and others pulled out of their asses to exercise their reign of terror over the peasantry. An airborne virus which remains viable even outside of the human body would not have been affected by quarantine measures one way or the other. And the early test case of theDiamond Princessdemonstrated that its mortality rate was pretty low even among supposedly vulnerable age groups. You can take off your mask!

                I was cruising in along in Passaic or Clifton when WABC announced Cuomo’s lockdown because of the Indian-run nursing homes he had packed Covid patients into, right across the thruway in, where was it, Rochelle, I think. So yes, House, you’re spot on on that one.
And voila, all of a sudden there was a #MeToo sex scandal in the Cuomo mansion with some reporterette or female staff member making “serious allegations.”

                Nah. Nobody cared about a bunch of old people dying of COVID – in fact, it was good for them. These people are a heavy burden on the state financial systems and overwhelmingly White and conservative. Cuomo was taken down because he was getting ready to corral his newfound fame and support into a Presidential run and as a swaggering alpha male he is everything the Dem party hates. He is a guy who prefers big infrastructure projects and decent governance than the progressive stack. At least Newsom is willing to play ball with the spiteful mutants as we saw this weekend.If they wanted to prosecute Cuomo for killing old people they could have done that, instead they ginned up sexual harassment claims and then dropped them immediately after he left. It was so obviously a fake op that it made me realize these people are not as good as they used to be.

                Partially. There were a large number of bills that he refused to sign because they were way too far to the left- if you can believe it. There are “people” in the New York state house that wanted to take the state to the left of California. Something Cuomo wasn’t too interested in doing.

            Great post.  Clearly, you understand New Amerika and her thought processes.You people want to survive the future? you best learn to grok her ways too.  You cannot defeat an enemy you don’t understand, much less defeat one you refuse to recognize as enemy.‘It gave women a victim switch they can flip at any time to use their newfound prosecutorial abilities to enforce that paradigm shift . . . .’What paradigm shift?  The Future is Female build back better shift, of course.  You know, the one they’ve been harping on and strutting about for the past decade.Check out Kathy Hochul, ‘Queen’ Victoria Nuland, and Gretch ‘the Wretch’ Whitmer.  Look what is easily read in their faces.  THAT is the future that New Amerika bends all her might to manifest, that is the feverdream within her sadistic soul.Ms. Amerika is not content with turning her own nation into a relational hellscape, she insists on forcing her ways down the throat of other nations, too.  This is the precious Our Democracy they keep babbling about.

            That’s why Newsom is choosing the riots as his hill to die on. It’s his chance to overcome his straight whiteness and show that he’s just as rad and out there as the craziest members of The Squad. Of course, it won’t work. The 2028 nomination will be snaffled up by the usual suspects..

        The future was always going to be fraught with uncertainty for America due to the substantial black population.  But there was always the hope they’d get up to snuff existing around the White majority.  Not surprisingly, it’s been a failure.  Now we’re importing tens of millions swarthy aliens compounding the problems.  The country as we knew it is pretty much toast – I’m not even sure some sort of “orania” type setup could survive.  A truly sad state of affairs.  Further, people like mark cuban are a huge part of THE problem.

            I disagree about the viability of an Orania-type setup in the US. I believe that US Whites have enormous advantages over our South African brethren. Two that spring to mind are relative numbers and armaments. If they can make it work down there, something similar can be made to work here.

                    Yes, the average westerner has never heard of Orania. The regime can pretend it doesn’t exist. It would be handled differently were it in Missouri. I’m not sure how, but differently.

                There is I believe a mistaken understanding of Orania’s purpose.  From one South African I heard in discussion, Orania is a last stand type of situation and is not realistically thought to be a self sustaining permanent refuge when the SHTF.  Rather it is hoped when the genocide begins, Whites may head there and wait for rescue by the West.
In general, I doubt such rescue, in whatever form, will happen.

                        The Xhosa ANC stay away because Orania’s on a Zulu land trust. Mandela was originally mad at the Zulu for enslaving his people, so he went to the Commies to find out how to win a homeland of his own, instead of one of the eight artificial tribal Homelands the apartheid program created to keep the blacks from killing each other.
Now the Afrikaaner are talking about a Cape Republic on the original coast and a Swaziland republic beside it which includes Orania and Zulu territory inland.

        I think that Musk felt – with reason – that with the amount of money he brought into the election and, more importantly, the way he changed the discourse – he would be able to get in there and dictate terms the way that certain other, let’s say, interest groups, do. Especially since Musk actually gave more money than prominent members of those interest groups. Of course that is not how it works, and Musk, being a sperg, failed to grasp that, was routed, and is now (understandably, honestly) upset.The USA is over. That much should be clear, both big and small. The federal government is a totally unmanageable beast that cannot be stopped and cannot be reformed. Men with drive and vision cannot fix it as there are millions of apparatchiks who will fight and win because the apparatchiks defend each other. On a local level, look at Los Angeles this weekend, we have tens of millions of unassimilated foreigners and their radicalized offspring who have no interest in living in the USA and will fight the USA with the cover of revolutionary government officials. It’s like Odessa in 1910. I just hope it doesn’t end the same way it did over there.

            I agree with much of what you say. But their radicalized offspring DO have an interest in living in the USA. In fact, they refuse to leave even as they wave the flags of their home countries. Let’s face it. Everyone wants to live around White people, especially if the Whites are forced at gunpoint to pay for everything.

                That’s the point. Losercons talk about the “proposition nation”, even if you accept that at face value, these people do not buy into the proposition and never will. They have no interest in even living in the fake Claremont version of the USA. They want to live in a socialist hellhole like the one they came from, just one with more money and where they get the benefits of it.

        for America to survive – as America – the part of the population that wants and supports that will have to condense into selected states/regions appropriate to their numbers.  i.e. substantial land must be forfeited and abandoned.  once new America stabilizes and grows new roots (and more people!) the project to reclaim the abandoned parts can begin.
to a certain extent, this condensing process has already started re: peole moving out of blue states, to go to red states.

                Look (and move and choose where to live) by county.  Yes, consider overall taxes, gun laws, etc., but every state with solid gun laws and/or low taxes has at least one heavily non-White county.  And those demographics are nowreported less honestly than ever.  AI claims my county is 97.52% White.  But hidden at the bottom of the census.gov numbers, it admits those who are White alone (not hispanic or latino) are 92.8%.  Still excellent, but not what it ought to be.  The rot has crept in everywhere.

                        Not much military presence in northeastern or midwestern blue states. Heavy military presence in red southeast and west. Also all the negros on welfare in southeastern states. That’s most of your discrepancy right there, I think.

                        Exactly. A great deal of that federal money is funding what amounts to an army of occupation.  On the one hand, welfare. And on the other, projects which enrich the kind of “successful” people Z is talking about in today’s post.  All of it undermining the culture which made the states “red” and shifting them towards purple or blue.
By the way, am I the only one who remembers when “red” meant commie and “true blue” meant rock-ribbed traditionalism and virtuous nobility?

            NO!  This is how a cuck thinks.  If we could get the political will to do what you are talking about, we could just as easily get the political will to kick the foreigners out.Most of the foreigners in the US are foreign citizens (IOW, not stateless people) who walked here.  They can turn their asses right around and walk back home and take their children with them.  Mexico, for example has a law that says any child born from Mexican citizens anywhere in the world automatically are Mexican citizens.  There is not one person of recemt Mexican heritage in the US that isn’t a Mexican citizen.  All these anchor babies are Mexican citizens.THEY MUST GO BACK!

        As our host here says, the solutions to the problems we face are easy.Stop spending. Now. Stop digging the hole deeper. Cut everything. No sacred rice bowls. Deep cuts.Stop sending money to Israel. They’ll get the message on Gaza and cease their campaign of terror against the Palestinians, who aren’t exactly angels either.Stop letting in Third World, incompatible barbarians here to leech off our welfare largesse. Send the ones here, illegal and legal, home without sympathy or mercy.Stop sending arms and intel to the Ukies. Let the chips fall where they may.But our system won’t allow it. The defense industry owns most of Congress. So aid to the Ukies and the Israelis and spending 10 times what the world combined spends on defense (I think China spends more than they say they do) will never cease. Never will we cut back on benefits to the “marginalized communities” because heaven forbid the blacks and browns have to earn a living to put food on the table or have to stop popping out endless kids paid for my tax dollars.The left-wing kook district judges need to have their power stripped to do nationwide injunctions. But the GOP-led Congress can’t bother and once they fumble away the midterms (likely on purpose) and hand the speaker’s gavel over to Occasional Cortex or some other commie, white-hating lunatic, the moment will pass.They’re all scavengers – our political class, the oligarchs, the Wall Street pirates, the dusky hordes that were once crossing our borders – feeding on the dying husk of this once-great nation. They will get theirs and these parasites don’t care that their host that lays the golden eggs will die.The only thing that stops the whole thing and brings real reform is a complete collapse, which is coming before 2035.

            Everything you propose is an echo of the past 45 years of Con, Inc. Emphasis on con. None of it ever happened, and none of ever will happen. It’s over. Your views are now an extreme minority in the US, whereas 45 years ago they were the majority. As they did not occur when you had actual power, thinking they will happen without it is simply childishness. But the conservative and dissident “movements” have been full of children making wish lists for as long as I’ve been alive.It’s not the “system,” it’s the people who live in this country, which includes our parents and grandparents and maybe even some of your great-grandparents. They permitted this to happen. It doesn’t matterwhyorhowthey did, or whether they were fully aware of the consequences or not. We are dealing with facts here. What on earth leads you to believe that you can undo organic facts of human migration and habitation after the fact, other than massive amounts of violence to remove them?And for the person who’s about to chime in “just cut off their benefits,” you, too, are equally deluded into thinking that it is your generosity with your tax money that is keeping them here. They are not as dependent upon you as you believe (American egos at work), and they are ethnically chauvinist and racially supremacist to a degree that is impossible for modern American sensibilities to even register, as that instinct was removed through education post-1965. Why, these are just future Americans, just like Mom and Pop’s family! Well, if they are, then they’ll be able to survive without SNAP, as they have ethnic solidarity and community that would permit them to pool resources and skills in the event that the debit cards stop arriving.You have an intractable demographic problem that is no longer amenable to a political solution, and — as I describe, above — never was, not even when the possibility to do something about this was ripe.

                I was not making a judgement on whether those things are possible. They are not because of the spendthrift ways of the false god of democracy and our system, which I agree with you is aided and abetted by our demographic displacement.But that isn’t the only reason. Special interests figured out how to either bribe D.C. politicians or get dirt on them or a little of both at a level we can’t even fathom.I’m not a conservative or do I make their arguments. I am an engineer and math is my specialty. And the math on our budgetary trajectory isn’t a good one. RamZPaul said 2035 will be our day of financial reckoning, but I think the financial collapse will be a lot sooner.Immigration is the greatest issue of our time. No distinction between illegal or legal because changing our demographics is unacceptable and anyone who says the great replacement is a conspiracy theory either has fart beans for brains or is in on the scam. If we fix that and deport these foreign invaders, a solution is more possible. With the status quo, it’ll be impossible.

            I remember back during the Bush pere era “family values” were all the rage on what passed for the Right. Lots of talk about that subject. But far more important are “white” values, one of which is probably nobility. Once we begin to dilate upon white values we will see what distinguishes us from most everybody else and why white identitarianism and white flourishing make so much sense.

            Yesterday saw many of our European friends, the ones who speak of nobility—veritable scholars and embodiments thereof, compared to the vulgar white diaspora of Trump and trucks and patriotic song—bragging that their brown hordes are more violent than ours.“You call that a riot? There’s a car on fire outside my window right now. There always is. It’s nothing to us.”If we’re going to start talking about it, we should consider what nobility really means. A true definition, not read from fantasy but from real life, would describe what the nobility actually does, e.g., hire foreigners to rape white children.A conservative would cheer it, I suppose. I mean, they do.Hierarchy!says the temporarily embarrassed rape-gang boss.

        States like Connecticut are now moving into the active phase of resettlement of minorities into majority-white areas, with a bill soon to be passed into law by the governor. The State will simply withhold money from towns that refuse to build “affordable” multi-family apartment complexes, which developers are racing to build for the enormous money involved:One piece of the bill known as “Towns Take the Lead” divides housing need among towns based on regional need and assigns each town a set number of units to plan and zone for. That means every five years, towns will have a certain number of units they need to plan for, and some of those units will have to be for families or set aside for certain income levels.Another change to watch for is Lamont’s proposal to allow towns to establish “priority housing development zones” that set a minimum density of four units per acre for single-family housing, six for duplexes or townhouses and 10 for multi-family housing.The zones allow this type of development “as of right,” or without a hearing before the local planning and zoning board. Towns that adopt these zones have easier pathways to temporary reprieves to a decades-old housing law known as 8-30g.https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-hb-5002-housing-bill/

            And therein lies the rub in today’s essay. There are the problems that need to be fixed that are easy to fix save for the will to execute. Then there are the other plans, like the Kalergi Plan, that people like Lamont have the will and psychopathy to execute. There are at least two competing plans. Well one side has a plan and is faithfully executing it even when execution looks like the chaos of racial conquest in LA. The other side isn’t a side. It doesn’t have a plan, it has fealty to decorum and fidelity to a piece of paper that are not a plan but a recipe for the ongoing decades long rout we have undergone.For that side to emerge, well, what is required is the will to execute.

            About the same thing Obama’s HUD Secretary was pushing before he left office.  Single family only housing zoning was to be abolished, or HUD money would be withdrawn to those areas.  As with CA, the State here has passed laws to allow you to build on your property smaller residential units.  This was passed by calling them “casitas” for grandma—or “granny” residences.  Of course, anyone can live there.Aside from the obvious detraction of SES mixing, Connecticut’s law might be better than CA or AZ.  If you build such from scratch, you then need to provide the proper infrastructure for the development.  The CA and AZ laws allow you to tie into existing infrastructure which was never designed for such population density.

                Even local zoning laws don’t mean much many areas. I recently read an article about some city in California where it’s become common is for unscrupulous landlords to buy rattletrap old RVs and put them on their property or even park them on residential streets and then rent them out for $800 a month.

        “This basic rule of systems can help explain why the United States finds itself in a crisis that, on the surface, seems easy to solve. The finances of the American empire are not so dire that they cannot be remedied. Some sacrifice would be needed, but with sound leadership, the fiscal house could be set right quickly. The same is true of the foreign policy challenges.”Not quickly nor easily. It would mean abandoning the elusive goal of maintaining hegemony, of being top dog, when the wherewithal is no longer there. But it seems the ship of state is like the Titanic, and plowing at full speed into an iceberg.“The recent public feud between Trump and Musk is useful in understanding something else about our elites.”This temporary alliance reminds me of the First Triumvirate — Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus. Pompey and Crassus could never stand each other but they entered into this three-way marriage of convenience. Essentially the Triumvirate bought not a politician here and there but the whole Roman government. I presume Musk and his fellow oligrachs have attempted the same.Without federal subsidies, contracts, and import protections, Musk just goes back to being the ordinary billionaire he was after the success of Paypal. He’s been sucking on the federal tit for decades. This is the Horatio Alger story of today — somehow get to suck on the federal tit. To give just one example, if the government stops slapping a 100% tariff on Chinese BYDs, Tesla will go under.

Whether true or not—since we won’t allow true competition in the marketplace to decide—from the few BYDs available, they seem like a Tesla rival to be sure.  On the other hand, the Chinese are worse than we are in this game.  If we were to allow true competition ala the Chinese way, BVD would have to build here and China could own no controlling interest in their USA production.

                    The Hilux is not here for two basic reasons; It’s creamed by general truck restrictions due to size, and it does not even begin to meet general pollution and safety features long required of all automobiles registered in the States.
Now we can argue about such regulations, but the point being they were not instituted to prevent the Hilux per se.

        Fantastic essay Z man. It has never been a question of having elites, who are always with us and – indeed – shape (whether we like it or not) the world we live in. I live in the suburbs of a city which, though now in several decades of decline, was built and beautified by its great entrepreneurs. Our city produced high-level clothing, shoes, photographic equipment, radios, railway signalling equipment, binoculars and eyeglasses, machine tools, early printers and computers, specialiized automotive parts, pharmaceuticals, and a whole constellation of spin-off businesses in related industries. The Titans who created this diverse and rich economy left their mark through libraries, hospitals, public works…Long story short, the men who built our industries and manufactures also built – effectively created – “our community”. Nowadays of course, we can’t openly acknowledge that these white male capitalists are the only reason we have a city at all. All the downtown banners depict obscure black people who are supposedly at the heart of the city’s history. And of course the regional airport is now re-named Frederick Douglass airport.

        Politically, Newsom is playing a game with Trump to boost his own chances as the Dem nominee by being a Trump Fighter. It is a dangerous game, LA is entering its dry time and arson could send up both skyscrapers in Dowtown in flames as well as neighborhoods. Newsom is daring Trump to arrest him for withholding tax revenue due the Feds, which is tax evasion and Bessent normally mild mannered has threatened him with jail.All the incentives are to fight and defeat Trump over deporting illegal aliens guilty of violent crimes. So there is that. KABC 7’s token vibrant anchor Marc Brown noted that “people were having fun watching cars burn” and that there should be no police deployment. The 101 Freeway through Downtown was shut down on the Southbound side, for most of Sunday, then various arson fires were launched in Downtown, with LAPD taking minimal action. Most of the action seemed to break up around at Midnight, so far this AM not much going on. What happens when the Anti-Fa wake up around 2 pm is anyone’s guess. Lots and lots of Mexican flags, no American ones, and various young non-White men mostly Latino having the time of their lives. No vibrant Basketball-Americans that I could see on the local news.Definitely organized and funded, even the local news bimbos noted it: cordless leaf blowers to push the tear gas away, gas masks, printed signs all the same, lots and lots fo fireworks to start fires, hammers to break off concrete to throw at cops from overpasses, and the like.

        Money Quotes:“Success in economic endeavors is never about higher values or transcendent beliefs. It is about making the mechanics of the economic system work in your favor. At every level, the people involved are nothing more than tools to be used by those above them.”“The American system does not produce noble men because it does not reward the qualities that such men must possess. In fact, having a higher purpose is disqualifying in most areas of life.”This why the Right needs a divorce from Capitalism/Free Markets.  Communism, while incorrect as a govt or economy, is correct on it’s critique of capitalism.  You’d think there’d by a 3rd way, right?  A noble peoplehood first, economy in service of that.

        “What the first months of the new Trump term show is that leaders can simply act, and their actions can change the rules of the system.”What Trump is doing is using the rules of the system against the system. Tariffs exist within the system and the President carries virtually unlimited tariff power. That makes tariffs a nuclear weapon because tariffs can be imposed on China, but the effect is on the real target: the globalist establishment. The system’s rules also say the President can organize USAID anyway he wants. So he effectively organized it out of existence, drying up nearly $25B in slush fund. That is an enormous amount of money taken from the grifters. On a whole range of topics, Trump simply used the bureaucratic rules to attack the bureaucracy. Once he gets his people confirmed in some key places, like the Merit Systems Protection Board, he can rewrite the rules to make it easier to fire bureaucrats. (Which is why that case is at SCOTUS.)Trump is currently using the system to attack itself in LA. His polling on deportations is going to skyrocket. By applying the law, his actions have won in court. That, in turn, has led to violent rioters waiving Mexican flags chanting “This is OUR country, we’re not leaving.” Those people are supported by local politicians and NGO’s who are outing themselves and are now vulnerable to criminal charges of domestic terrorism and insurrection – charges that STICK and for which judges cannot simply practice “catch and release” using NGO and rich Democrat bail money…lest they, too, get arrested for the same charges.And now you have Mexico’s president demanding lower taxes on remittances – money stolen from the US and sent to Mexico. She stupidly announced their biggest weakness, and something that would get a lot of votes in Congress to raise.Trump is waging asymmetric war by using the system’s own rules against it.  The system is trying to fight back, but it’s losing popular support in the process.  And Trump can just change to a new tactic.  There’s more than one tariff power, for example.  And if Alien Enemies Act gets tossed, he can now add insurrection or domestic terrorism to his arsenal thanks to the riots.

            I wish I could agree with you, but I cannot. The public does not matter, the center of gravity are the courts, particularly District Court Judges, who control everything and the Senate.They will order Trump to un-deploy the National Guard and Marines. He will have to obey, making him again a TACO. Trump always chickens out.The point is to show the Senate and House that Trump is weak, when Hakeem Jeffries impeaches Trump and Vance after the midterms they will have to back the strong horse, Dems, and convict in the Senate. Thus Jeffries becomes President and Newsom becomes the Vice President. [The DoJ will NOT prosecute anyone associated with riots, interfering with federal agents, etc. Let us be real here — Trump can put who he wants in charge, neither Bondi nor Patel have any real power and we all know it.]Normie, businesses, etc. they don’t matter. What matters is the people with real power: Judges who are more powerful and routinely over-rule the President, the Media, and the House and Senate. Reps there are begging to lose so they can go back to losing forever and not get called Rossists. Per Midnight’s Edge Norwegian dude.Newsom is a slimy creature, but he’s got an astutely tuned sense of power. He knows Trump is weak, cannot back up his threats, by showing the centers of power his relative strength and Trump’s innate boomer weakness, he wins.

                Just one problem: the Guard is already activated/deployed, the judge has no jurisdiction over Title 10 activation, and Hegseth has already announced active duty troops are next.  Like I wrote, they’re using the rules of the system very effectively.Look at that “Maryland man” they sent to prison in El Salvador.

            Victim blaming is a cornerstone of democracy. “Well you voted for it” is the real trick of democracy. The people blame themselves for the maleficence of the elites who set policy.

                I always being that up in regards to Somalis being imported into Minnesota: it’s not like they were given a choice.  Yeah they’re liberal cucks but it’s not like they were going to vote Republican if the Dems *didn’t* move Somalis in.

            Very few “common men” are getting government gibs. No, the “common man” is working a shitty job to pay all those taxes that fund the food, rent, and medical care given to anyone but him. And yes, this includes paying outrageous insurance premiums that subsidize those who don’t pay into the system.
In Europe, the social safety net worked fairly well when they had a homogonous (aka White) population. The problem now is that Whites pay and others suck the system dry.

                    Yes. And this, along with Social Security, is one of the few benefits that White people ever see after paying into it for decades. However, far too many people receiving it were not born here and didn’t pay into the system. (Even if it’s a dozen people, it’s too many.) They need to be cut off yesterday. And we all know that fraud is rampant.But it’s interesting that this (Medicare and Social Security) is what politicians choose to focus on — the benefits actually received by the common man (aka White people). There’s a long list of “gibs” that need to be cut long before you get to stuff like Medicare. If these programs are cut, White people should scream. We’ve been complacent for far too long, sacrificing for the “common good” or to “balance the budget” while the government shovels money at everyone but us.

This also is why both are targeted. The reason not to support any cuts to either program is because they still to this day benefit primarily whites.

                            Exactly. Cutting these is like the European governments cutting benefits for White pensioners, even as they shower new arrivals with housing and medical benefits that only further displace the native White population. If anything, Whites should be demanding more gibs, not less — at least until the governments stop shoveling money/benefits at people who don’t belong here.

                        There is some truth to what you say. Nevertheless I recall reading that defense spending and Social Security which I assume includes Medicare and Medicaid are something like 2/3 or more of the budget. Now please don’t get me wrong, I’m in full agreement that non-citizens shouldn’t get any government benefits of any kind, save perhaps in very limited exceptions. Interest on the debt is 16% of the total federal spending alone. That number is not going to drop.In brief, while there is doubtlessly some fraud, waste and abuse in those items, The awful truth is that the vast majority of the federal budget is untouchable in any real sense.

                    Eligible at 65, but not required.  You can skip it.  However, to pick it up later, you are penalized by a premium increase—something like 10% per year or so.
I did not wish to take it, but could find *no* insurance policy/company in this State that did *not* require that I be on it before accepting me.  There are any number of folks who for reasons like religious belief will not sign up for Medicare.

                        I do not want it, but am going to be forced to sign up when I file for social security in a few months (to begin when I turn 67 a few months later).  I only have to get the basic, because I’m still covered by my husband’s health insurance – and we got the Health Savings Account, because the PPO plan was unaffordable.  Not to mention I avoid all doctors like the plague.  And evenin our closest SS office (in a town of about 13k) I have to do it all by phone and computer – you cannot make an appointment to see anyone in person.  Whole thing SUCKS.

                    p.s.- even on subsistance SS, you still have to pay monthly for it, mine is 10%, even though I never enrolled. Plus, of course, all the extras not paid by the basic, and taxes (!) as well.
And also yes, it’s the same dizzying slurry of insurance bullshit. Imagine trying to deal with this crap when you’re 85 and in chronic pain or seriously ill.

            Yes, but it’s not about the “gibs”. Or at least that’s not the lion’s share. The core of the problem is we as a people have abandoned our communities. Look in the mirror and answer honestly: What have I done to make my community a better place for someone to raise a family?

                I bet everyone here can answer—with examples—in the affirmative in that regard.  You just disagree what that is.  Basically, I consider any decent person living their lives according to some basic moral/societal precept—as was instilled in me by my parents—to be contributing to making the society “better”.
How about you citing some examples of what we should be doing?

                I pay taxes, clean up after myself, maintain my property, do not destroy public property for sport, do not steal, etc.  That should be enough.

            Well, if the white man doesn’t demand his gibs, they’ll just give the money away to nonwhites and illegals.
Why should poor, elderly white people get bankrupted by the medical rackets while Negroes and beaners get free treatment?

            Right.
The problem is an old man getting “free” replacement spokes on his wheelchair, from his own tax dollars.
Shoot him.
Elon spends more federal tax money on drugs every day than the average worker pays in a lifetime.
Anyone who says so is a communist. Shoot that guy too.

        And in regards to your brilliant comment on men with a sense of nobility (these men would effectively have negative status in today’s America), I fear Atlas has already shrugged and walked away.
My assumption is that these men are quietly building their own societies, granted they have to start on a very small scale and most likely they will keep things on a small scale as to no longer lose control to a larger group of less noble people as has happened in the past centuries through for example democracy.

        “Our elites think of themselves as temporarily successful paupers.”Because it is true. When you replace the word ‘elites’ with its proper synonym, ‘parasites’, everything makes a lot more sense.As for your comments on the rules of systems rewarding certain people, and that reward manifesting as status…right, all status-obsessed societies are doomed to become shitholes like India, the Middle-East, Africa or China, where status reigns supreme.Status is a euphemism for being wrong. It is why engineers tend to be low status, and good engineers in fact have zero status. To be right is anathema to a status granting system. Athletes have high status, but making a career out of playing games is for children: children play games, parents clean up messes. And right now, we have lots of children playing the status, power, and wealth games; and very few people who behave like parents.
