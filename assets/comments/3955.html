        Concierge medical care is where it’s at if you want to be a Doctor in this country, rather than a Medical Establishment Slave. That is, until The Emperor outlaws any such service because it conflicts with his boondoggle socialist medical program AKA Obamacare. Who said all slaves are poor?

        And I was the “invisible person” (admin) at an American University conference with some ‘elite Canadian academics’ and heard them chuckling as they answered the American elites question of the reality of Can HCare “ha ha ha, we pay 17k a year and belong to a secret private network, a bit off-legal, but it works!” [intimating hauntingly that they don’t “do” healthcare with the little people, nor do they “do” waiting in line.]
Pretty much what it will come to here–for those that can afford it.

        In Canada, the Canadian Medical Society has wielded it’s power to keep enrollment into medical schools much lower than the number who would like to attend. Enrollment was kept to 1975 levels until 2004. During this time the population had increased roughly 50%, and there are currently many people without a family physician.
And of course, the solution now, as in many sectors of the economy, is to import doctors rather than train willing youth.

        I used to have a doctor as a near neighbour, years ago. He suddenly left home with his family (the kids toys were scattered on the back porch as if it was just another day at home) and fled because he had apparently overstepped the mark on some medical procedure.On this I am hazy, but his hospital didn’t like something he’d done (or not done) and so he felt it necessary not to stay and sort it out but to get the hell out as quickly as possible and back to a country where things were pretty unstable.IIRC, he fled back to Egypt, and being a Coptic Christian you might think he was jumping from a potential frying pan into a roaring fire.I did hear later he had been exonerated in his absence, but he was long gone and that was another medical expert lost to the NHS. The British medical system, which we are told is the envy of the world even if no one else copies it, has to keep importing doctors because the older ones are giving up and few Brit-borns are coming through. But it is nice to know they might be able to bugger off if someone asks a question they don’t like.

            Years ago I had a cat with a bad heart. As a kitten it was learned he had a heart murmur so they sent me to a cat cardiologist. At the time, I thought it was the nuttiest thing I’d ever heard. The main reason I agreed to go for the consultation was to see for myself what a cat cardiologist did.The facility was five star and the staff was high professional. It was a bit intimidating to be honest. The doctor was very nice, extremely smart and very informative. I was imagining the bill growing larger by the minute until he produced an estimate for the consultation, which was $300. I agreed and we proceeded to the examination room which looked like the flight deck of the Enterprise.My cat ended up with first rate treatment at pennies on a dollar compared to what humans would pay. The doctor was the son of a human heart surgeon. He went into a veterinary work because he did not want to deal with lawyers and government. Plus, he could run a high end practice and focus on his patients, while making a nice living.In America, we treat our pets better than we treat humans.

        One of my business partners has four sons, one is a resident MD now and one has just been accepted into medical school.   I’ve gotten a pretty good feeling for the med school maze from talking to him.  Bottom line lots of sharp US guys applying for med school, but rather than expand the schools to meet demand, lots of foreign MDs are imported for residencies.  the Federal govnt funds all residencies so they control the system.  Under Obama the affirmative action for med schools has gotten obscene.

        Mrs. (doctor) Charming comes home frequently with frightening examples of this problem.
Backdoor deals and ‘who you know’ are already affecting access to competent medical care, it’s downhill from here.
She’s not ready to retire yet, but recently, she’s starting to talk about it. She doesn’t want to leave medicine, but she sees it’s beginning to leave her.
The foreigners situation is worse than you think.

        NP’s aren’t going to solve this problem and they don’t need a dr’s union to block them, nurses are quite capable of fucking up their own practice, by the numbers and without MD input, thank you very much.  See the current push by the nursing powers that be toward phd np’s vs. the blossoming number of diploma mills churning out barely qualified np’s.

        NP’s (and to a much lesser extent, PA’s) can save us from this disaster, but only if the Doctor’s union can be convinced or bludgeoned out of the way.

        I think that most medics in ancient Rome were Greek or Greek educated, the Romans gave Roman citzenship to freed slaves, the Greeks tought that the Romans were crazy for doing this, when the Greeks freed their slaves it remained a residential alien.
