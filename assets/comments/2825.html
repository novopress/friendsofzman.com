        I guess it didn’t occur to them that they’re using dirty money to project power and impose their values on people?  If they really thought fossil fuels were evil, surely they’d just shoot the money into the sun.

        They probably have an investment manager who told them it would not hurt them any to dump those stocks and move the money into something else. My guess is the sellers took their profit, a publicity photo, and never give it another thought.

        When people and businesses sell these ‘toxic’ assets, I presume someone buys them. Someone perhaps with far less interest in the welfare of the world and who may want their newly-acquired income stream to make life hard for others?
Or do the people who sell these assets imagine they are only bought by people with nice thoughts, or perhaps the assets will disappear from the market thanks to the intervention of a kind fairy?
