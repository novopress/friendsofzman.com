        “The first bullet out of their gun is to demand why you are denying gays the same rights as straights.”And the second bullet is to take whatever argument you’ve just made and feed it right back to you.  A worry that making homosexuality chic and acceptable will lead to something bad, like tolerance for pedophilia or improved access of child molesters to victims, or encourage other perversions to lobby for acceptability will spark the immediate retort, “So you’re equating loving, stable homosexual unions with child molesting?!”  “So you’re comparing homosexuality with bestiality?!”  And it’s said in such an outraged, self-righteous tone, as if that in itself is a sufficient rebuttal.  And in the face of such hostility, the conservative typically falls back on stuttering denials.  The best response would be to simply ignore the restatement of one’s position or even just concede the point, then reiterate the question, and this time insist it be addressed.

        It’s sacrilegious to even discuss some issues in public. To utter the possibility of an alternate truth from the talking points will get you convicted of a blasphemy in the court of public opinion.

        You sound as bad as the leftwing extremists. All this talk of drawing lines, polarizing media networks, and having no real opinion other than what you’ve been fed; this is how you structured your own article. We are not at war with each other. Stop this he said-she said nonsense. Just because you are able to formulate sentences (sentences used only to generalize a group of people) does not mean this is a legitimate argument. I do not see any of your own opions here other than the finger-pointing that you yourself criticized. I am just cofused as to how you think yourself any different from the people you have just marginalized in this article? I mean everyone is entitled to their opinion, but don’t fool youtself; you’re no better. Its actually quite comical to see the exact behaviors you condemn present in your article. I hope the people reading will consider my words and ignore their allegiance to their party for a moment before attacking me. God bless America, a nation STILL divided…

            OK, let’s take a test.  A Liberal is fed, say, five policy positions by the cult.  He will rattle them off and blindly defend them, as a card-carrying member of the team.  He will loudly support the team candidate for President, no matter who he or she is or what that person actually represents.  A “Conservative” is also given five conservative policy positions.  He might defend one or two, disagree with a couple, and have no opinion whatsoever on the rest.  He will often disagree with other conservatives over the various talking points and policy prescriptions.  He will be all over the map on which Presidential candidate to support, as he weighs the various policy prescriptions, and reviews the temporal and philosophical consistency of the political platforms of each candidate.So is there really any equivalency here?  I think not.BTW, my personal belief is that most of the red team and all of the blue team are really one big team, fooling us all.  I do not think I am alone on the otherwise mostly conservative side of the fence.  How many Liberals buy into that “one big team” argument?

                McConnell and Boehner are proving every day that there is one party, the billionaires party. They have spent every bit of their political capital pushing through Obama’s deeply flawed trade deal. Normal political parties use these times to stick it to the other team.
America now has the Liberal Party and the Moderately Liberal Party, which has a conservative minority. A third of Republicans would prefer to be Democrats, but circumstances landed them in the GOP. Another third are happy to be led around by the nose.

        Hofferesque. But you are too generous in making them striped donkeys when fish would do. Although, one can’t be run over by stampeding fish.

        You write like you are as old as I am. I’m in my mid 70s. It takes a long time to gain insight into the human condition.I read you every day. You’re very clever. Like you, I write every day. I think I’m pretty clever, too. And there are lots of people out there who think and write every day who are also very clever. But the tide comes in and the tide goes out every day and does not seem to notice our deliberations. Pity. All this cleverness going to waste.Today’s post was insightful but, by tomorrow, I will have forgotten it – except for this sentence: “The worst thing that can happen to a zebra is to be noticed by the lions.”  Almost every one of your posts contains at least one nugget. That is why I come here – to pan for gold.Thanks.

        It really is the only explanation. Otherwise it’s just absolutely sickening how intellectually dishonest they are.  Every time the Religion of Peace blows up a crowd they go out of their way to excuse the perpetrators and insist it was a one off incident.
