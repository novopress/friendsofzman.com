        I likeShiloh Hendrix– a mother defending her child against bullies. She is another White hero. OTOH – Sharmake Omar is an enemy alien, who should be deported immediately, without any interference from leftwing judges or commissars. Deport them all – Omar, his family and the rest of his tribe.The author is right about Somalians. They are a disgusting breed. Bush-41, Clinton and Bush-43 let them in, as demanded by their Jewish advisors, handlers and donors. Somalia is a shit-hole. All of Africa is a shit-hole, because of its lack of human capital. Somalian migrants have turned Minneapolis into a shit-hole too. Jews think that’s funny.As forKarmelo Anthony– he’s another black criminal, caught in the act of stealing from Whites at a school sports event. He brought a knife, which he used to kill a White person. Blacks rejoiced at that, and gave him money as a reward. Later, a mulatto judge let him out on reduced bail. He is another Black hero.

        The choosing of the new Pope is of course recently in the news. He was chosen rapidly. Here is a background photo that may partially explain the reasons why and also the suspiciously large number of pizzas that were ordered during the conclave.

        JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.’maybe He doesn’t but Paul does:St. John ChrysostomDoctor of the Church*And so says Isaiah, the chief of the Prophets, You shall not overlook your kinsmen of your own seed. Isaiah 58:7, Septuagint For if a man deserts those who are united by ties of kindred and affinity, how shall he be affectionate towards others? Will it not have the appearance of vainglory, when benefiting others he slights his own relations, and does not provide for them? And what will be said, if instructing others, he neglects his own, though he has greater facilities; and a higher obligation to benefit them?Will it not be said, These Christians are affectionate indeed, who neglect their own relatives? He is worse than an infidel. Wherefore? Because the latter, if he benefits not aliens, does not neglect his near kindred. What is meant is this: The law of God and of nature is violated by him who provides not for his own family… It was the design of God, in uniting us by the ties of kindred, to afford us many opportunities of doing good to one another…Because it is not the same thing to neglect our kindred, as to neglect a stranger. How should it be? But the fault is greater here, to desert one known than one who is unknown to us, a friend than one who is not a friend.”-Commentary on 1 Timothy 5:8, “But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.”

        I remember Tom Lehrer well; my parents had all his records when I was growing up in the 50s and 60s. I sing karaoke versions of “Poisoning Pigeons”, “Irish Ballad” and “Christmas Carol” at the appropriate times of the year.
I don’t think it makes any practical difference in these days of free YouTube music, but Lehrer released all his songs into public domain two and a half years ago.

            This one is probably my favorite and is more germane to a topic frequently discussed here:

        ‘Whatever this new Pope thinks Jesus taught, we always have, we everywhere do, and I hope we always will “rank our love for others.” It’s our nature to do so: deep, deep in our human nature.’
Yes.
I can carp at Derb for being too comfortable with obvious enemies, but his fundamental impulse is sound.

        If the Roman Catholic Church takes a stong universalist line it may lose a lot of adherentsGod became man and endured the humiliation of taking on a body, then was tortured and executed but didn’t make it clear enough that he wanted a unified faith and worship? And if He did, there is no way to know what that faith is or how he wants to be worshiped?  So, we get competing and fallible human institutions which worry not about the truth, because that’s impossible to know, but about attendance levels. Since these thousands of competing Christian churches are all wrong about something they should worry about contemporary issues and popular opinion to get butts in pews.this type of mindset is why the west can never get out of the enlightenment

            If that’s so, why does the RC Church permit its various rites such as Ruthenian, Byzantine, Syriac, Maronite, etc. to retain their own liturgies? It’s for purely practical reasons. If they pushed the issue of the common mass on them, they’d leave. That sounds to me like a competitive and fallible human institution that’s not worried about the truth but is worried about attendance levels.

        Back in the 60’s I lived in New Jersey and listened to the Larry Josephson morning program (when he showed up) on WBAI in New York. He played a song, “Giovanni Batista Montini The Pope” which had been recorded at the station. It was hilarious and in the Tom Lehrer style but I don’t remember who it was. I haven’t since been able to find any trace of it. This is also the case of a talk by a well known music personality on Public Radio, “What Beethoven Had For Breakfast”. It was full of jokes about everyone from von Karajan to Viola players in symphony orchestras.

            What’s the difference between a violia and a coffin? With a coffin the dead body is INSIDE the wooden box…. I don’t think I got that exactly right.

                Indeed. I enjoy Tom Lehrer, but if you wrote a similar song at the expense of Mr. Lehrer’s religion, you’d never hear the end of it.

                    I don’t think Lehrer’s religion is what you think it is; pretty sure he’s an atheist. That aside, check out Weird Al Yankovic’s “Pretty Fly For a Rabbi”. It treats Judaism with the same cheerful irreverence that “Vatican Rag” does Catholicism, and I don’t recall any fuss being made over it.

                        Jews make jokes about Judaism, too. Mohel humor is an entire genrehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDABzGe94GUA sharp sense of humor is widespread among Jews. That’s why there are so many Jewish comedians. Also why Jews are way better company than the stone-faced legions of antisemitism.
