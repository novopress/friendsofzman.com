        As Pinochet found out, the only way to fight these murderous wackos is to give them free helicopter rides‚Ä¶.They cannot be educated or civilized.

            That only ‚Äúworks‚Äù for a while. Normal, decent people will not tolerate murder as a solution.
What‚Äôs needed is a new paradigm that rules utopianism out of bounds. If the majority of people see the utopians as a dangerous threat to order, in the same way we look at members of a cult of personality, then you have a self-sustaining system to keep the lunatics under control. Think about it. If a popular politician was discovered to be a member of the Scientology cult, they would be forced out of office.

                expulsion complements your prescription.  the first space colonies will most likely be for these social rejects.  this is the policy of Britain, re: Australia, and it worked well.  Edwardian England was probably the absolute safest society in history.

                    Well not really, the convicts sent to Australia accepted 1.

The governors was expected to bring the social order to bear in the penal colony ‚Äì absolutely everyone accepted that without question 3. When a Governor strayed from this course they were recalled, even the father of Australia, the great Lachlan Macquarie.

                The problem is that the utopians presently control most institutions. Sure, Trump won, and the republicans control both houses of congress, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. As an example, recall Sessions debasing himself to the leftists in his confirmation hearing. He spent almost the entire hearing engaging in a futile effort to convince these people he was on ‚Äòtheir side‚Äô and he still got torn up by the liberal media over it. So long as those who are supposed to be in opposition to the utopians feel the need to beg for acceptance, there will be no substantive changes in this regard.

                In agree. Traditional Americans hold a lot of political power right now, but they are not about to murder the Cult lunatics. This would be the case even if they were to obtain complete power. I  hope realism takes hold among the vast majority of us, but I‚Äôm pessimistic. The best we can hope for might be an Augustus and a long Pax Americana followed by a long decline. I would take this any day as opposed to Ta-Nehisi Coates and his ilk running things.

                    If you look at the previous Progressive Awakenings, they seem to be having less and less of an impact on society. The New Deal left polices that are still with us. The JFK/LBJ years left some things, but they are eroding quickly. The Obama years have left exactly one item and that will shortly be gone.
What‚Äôs left to reform is not amenable to the blank slate thinking of the Left.

                Think about it. If a popular politician was discovered to be a member of the Scientology cult, they would be forced out of office.

                Problem with that is that utopianism is firmly embedded in our culture (particularly in influential New England). That‚Äôs where things like government schooling, alcohol and drug prohibition, policing (I think), and other such schemes got their start.

        This Coates character doesn‚Äôt have an answer to how the ‚Äú‚Ä¶the pillaging of life, liberty, labor and land‚Äù came to an end‚Ä¶I imagine.He doesn‚Äôt mention the color of the Admirals and sailors that shut off the West Coast slave trade by destroying the forts and harbors of the slave ships.  Or the overwhelming color of the army that marched south.  Or even the race of which Abraham Lincoln was a member.The White race has definitely been a mixed blessing for his group, but I don‚Äôt believe we were the people that first attached the chains to his ancestors necks, or drove them from the interior to the coast.  Ask Barack about that sometime.   Whites are clearly the only race that thought freeing his ancestors was a good idea, though maybe NOT our best idea.Silly Negro.

            Coates is an interesting character. His back story is largely fictional. He tailored it to titillate the sort of white liberals who write him checks. How much of this was on purpose and how much was instinct is hard to know. He went to a special high school where being black would have got him special praise and lots of help. When he went to Howard, where being black got him nothing, he dropped out.Obama followed a similar path. He was special in prep school, but then found he was not all that special at Occidental College so he got himself into the Ivy League, where he would be put on a pedestal. How much of this was calculated and how much of it was instinct is impossible to know, but I‚Äôve always suspected it is instinct with Obama. Trading on his skin came naturally so he gravitated to where it worked best.The thing with Coates is he avoids writing or saying too much that can be challenged on factual grounds. His big ‚Äúthink piece‚Äù on reparations made no specific proposals that could be examined. It was just a demand that white people feel bad, which makes a lot of sense since he makes his money from white people who feel bad. That article made his bosses feel good about feeling bad so they loved it and loved him for it.Is he so clever as to do this on purpose? It is possible, but his writing suggests a very mediocre mind. His columns read like soemthing you see from high school kids. Maybe that‚Äôs part of the act, but we‚Äôre getting into the area of super-genius arch-criminal. Maybe he is, but my hunch is he is just a dumb guy who is really good at one thing ‚Äì making rich white people feel bad for him.

                Don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever read this quote but Booker T. Washington wrote about such people a century ago, ‚ÄúThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs ‚Äî partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.‚Äù

            A Detroit official whose position I do not now remember, perhaps comptroller or something of that nature, a black lady who was not obviously of the inferior mayoral type, made a frank comment a few years ago which impressed me. She said that most blacks in Detroit, however marginal their lives, preferred living in those conditions among themselves to the stress of living a better economic life in a competition in which they would none the less compare poorly to others.

                What convinced me Herman Cain was nothing but a huckster and a fraud was the day after the Ferguson riots on his radio show proclaimed ‚ÄùWhat they (the rioters) need is job training!‚Äù as has been noted above, ‚Äùjob training‚Äù is of dubious worth at best.Plus, the fact is the majority of Africans IN America are not ‚Äùunemployed‚Äù they‚Äôre unemployable ‚Äì by anyone with any sense whatsoever. In fact, due to criminal history, they often CAN‚ÄôT be hired either because of liability issues or laws barring the hiring of those with a felony record (or certain felonies such as sex or drug offenses).Remember how Judges would give an offender the choice ‚ÄùArmy or prison‚Äù? That can‚Äôt be done anymore because the Armed Forces would, immediately and without question, reject the potential recruit.

            Abraham Lincoln did not send Whites marching South  for the benefit of Blacks.   He sent them marching South to get back the money the North had lost when the South became independent.   75% of all import revenue was earned by Southern products being shipped to Europe,  yet 40% of the revenue ended up in New York and Washington D.C. coffers.
It was prying the Washington DC/New York hands off of the Southern produced money that caused the war,  and nothing else.

                    One of my g-g grandfathers took the trouble to write a short book of memoirs of his experiences in the war.  His writing tended towards a matter of fact style.  But one of the few sections where raw emotion came through was in the descriptions of the freed slaves that joined their column during the swing out of Atlanta towards Savanah.  Mind you, he had been held a prisoner in Libby until exchange, early in the war, seen half his regiment become casualties, in an hour. holding the Union center against Hoods counterattack at Peachtree Creek, but the plight of these folks seemed to effect him in a very particular way.

            Did you read his bio on Wikipedia?  He is a ‚Äúdindu nuffin.‚Äù  He is Ta Nishi Paul Coats, d.d.n.  I have created a new designation in the vein of MD, PhD, MBA, etc. called the ‚Äúd.d.n.‚Äù for ‚Äúdindu nuffin.‚Äù  The most recent example being the 30 year, get that, Thirty Years in Congress, John ‚ÄúCivil Rights Icon‚Äù Lewis.  In all that time he has sponsored some 14 bills, ten of which were to name bridges, building and streets.  And those were only a fraction of the ones submitted and voted down.  Wow!  What an accomplishment for thirty years of service to the Black Causus, much less the American people living in his Georgia district.  PE Trump was right to call him out on his lack of accomplishments and wasting time on grandstanding when there are real problems that go unsolved.But back to Coates.  he is just another chosen ‚Äúblack‚Äù who has somewhat of a gift with the written word if only from a black racist persuasion.  He is popular in some circles but has nothing of real significance to put him standing with other Black authors of real fame.  Granted he is still young, but the amount of PR surrounding this ‚Äúd.d.n.‚Äù is astounding.  It is all smoke and mirrors, and racism.

                        P.S.  I count Jews and Arabs as the same demographic, with the same phenotypic strategies.  For example, ‚ÄúPalestinians‚Äù as victims- camoflauge.
The chauvinist faction of Jews, the globalist bad seeds,  can be called the Jacobeans, or Judahites, referring to their founding story of a stolen birthright.  It may have begun as a warning to the other clans of their proclivities.
The main success of camoflague is lumping all together.  Most Peoples really don‚Äôt care for their bad seeds, even though they will defend them.  That‚Äôs the problem.

        Once upon a time, I was quite patient with those who talked or wrote about the plight of the negro; no more. Nonsense like that column gets an immediate disagreement and if it keeps up, open contempt.

            The cult of saving all the black children in Africa is one reason I quit going to church. Nearly every church has a missions bulletin board pinned with pictures and pleas to obey a Jewish guru and save black children. ‚ÄúRed and yellow, Black and white, They are precious, In his sight.‚ÄùMyself, I‚Äôd rather risk going to Hell‚Äîthe Nordic underworld ruled by Loki‚Äôs half-dead daughter‚Äîthan to accept an eternal reward in a foreign middle-eastern capital city floating in the clouds. And frankly, people looking forward to an eternal reward in a foreign middle-eastern city are no more loyal to the soil on which they live than those praying on rugs facing Mecca.

                    Sad but true! Rather than being a Good Samaritan busybody, I much prefer the ancient Greek proverb attributed to Aesop and popularized by Benjamin Franklin:
‚ÄúGod helps those who help themselves.‚Äù
Which implies a doctrine of ‚Äúbenign neglect.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of ‚Äòbenign neglect‚Äô.‚Äù -Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, memo to President Richard Nixon, January 1970

                    And who is your neighbor? Jesus specifically shot down your narrow definition of a neighbor, and stated that you had to help anybody in need, in the parable of the Good Samaritan.

                        Wrong again, STP. The Good Samaritan parable outlines a specific case of strangers helping strangers when they find themselves alone together in a hostile environment (until quite recently, the roads were the most dangerous environment that an individual could find himself in outside a hot war zone). Again, if Jesus‚Äô intent was to enjoin us to invite random and hostile foreigners into our homes and neighborhoods, He would have specifically said so. But He did not.

                I will keep repeating myself, even though I get tired of it.  Quit blaming the fricking immigrants, legal or illegal.  The traitors to America are mostly ‚ÄúWhite folk‚Äù, that is politicians who have sold you out for a buck.  They are the ones in cahoots with big business, the Bar Association, the AMA, Big Pharma, you name it, to infest the country with ‚Äúvotes‚Äù for liberals/democrat politicians.  Yes, there are RINO‚Äôs included in that but by and large it is the DemonCraps who benefit most.Focus people.  Blacks, Mexicans are easy targets for lazy thinking.  Why don‚Äôt you start blaming the ones holding the purse strings and creating these programs through the largess of the Federal Government?  Why?

        Same question as always, where to start. I‚Äôve read many histories of the French Revolution but have not as yet touched the biographies of Robespierre sitting on my desk. One by JM Thompson, Twelve Who Ruled by RR Palmer, and others. One interesting book by Norman Hampson called Prelude to Terror is a study of the thought process of the revolutionaries leading up to that time and the sort of competition for hearts and minds that went on between the writings of Montesquieu and Rousseau, and the internal contradictions suffered by revolutionary apologists. The thing that really stands out is the fact that the supposed disciples of Rousseau, if subjected to even halfway reasonable interpretation of his writings, were inveterate hypocrites. The general will was never supposed to be subject to representation, and the men of the national assembly weren‚Äôt even sent to Paris by those that chose them for the actual purposes that they put themselves to doing. They usurped power and murdered a standing king, putting themselves in his place, and then abused the power they stole from him in ways that he would never in his most lurid nightmares never dreamt of . All of the moral comparisons Burke makes between Louis XVI  and the revolutionaries is true, and he even wrote RotRiF before the terror.The two books I‚Äôve found most helpful about the development of early Christian doctrine have been The Early Church by Henry Chadwick, and Early Christian Doctrines by JND Kelly. Chadwick is soft on Pelagius as his later writings confirm that he himself is a liberal, but the history is sound. The key as to why Christendom was at the heart of modernity is a paradox of sorts. After agreeing on the canonicity of the writings we call the New Testament, the leaders of the faithful were faced with people who wanted to take one part or one aspect of those writing and place their favorite part ahead of all the others. This is the basis of heresy. The Church Fathers had to then get together and decide if what this person was saying was consistent with the scripture as a whole, or if carried to its logical conclusion it would be the undoing of the consensus within the scriptures. Because the seat of the Roman Empire had moved to the east and was now under the thinking modes and language of the east, and the fact that the canonized writings themselves were in Greek, the philosophical language used for the evaluation and determination of judgement was that of the neoplatonists. Neoplatonic thinking continued to affect major thinkers in the west long after all of the theological controversies died down and the principles of plenitude and continuity found there became the metaphysics behind Galileo, Copernicus and eventually Darwin. The Metaphysics of Modern Science by EA Burtt, and AO Lovejoy‚Äôs The Great Chain of Being describe this.The funny thing is that the seeming intolerance found in those fighting heresy is more tolerant than the supposed tolerance espoused by the heretics themselves. Every. Single. Time.

        When you go back to the Congress of Vienna, which marked the end of the Age of Napoleon and the restoration of the old order, you find that the congregants there decided they would collectively put down, and deal harshly with any more uprisings that could lead to another French Revolution and reign of terror etc.  The subsequent repression of civil rights was unrelenting.  The pendulum, as it often seems to, swung far in the opposite direction.  Reforms in the ancien regime were needed, but the French Revolution and Napoleon so traumatized the old order they were in no mood for any change no matter how gradual.  Right across the channel in England they had a model that since 1688 had been on a course of gradual reforms of the old order and as a result experienced only small uprising here and there which were usually pacified with limited reforms.  The european leaders never picked up on Edmund Burke‚Äôs quote on leadership:  ‚ÄúA disposition to preserve and an ability to improve taken together would be my standard of a statesman.‚Äù

            It‚Äôs sad when Christians falsely purport that the only other religious choice is atheism; it seems they know nothing of American history. For example:‚ÄúI have generally been denominated a Deist, the reality of which I never disputed, being conscious I am no Christian‚Ä¶‚Äù -Ethan Allen, The Only Oracle Of Man: A Compendious System Of Natural Religion, 1784And that natural religion of which Ethan Allen spoke is written into our Declaration of Independence by another Deist, who also equated Nature with God. Such religion has a long history in Western civilization, and was preserved via Lucretius‚Äô ‚ÄúDe rerum natura,‚Äù which long precedes your Jewish salvation cult.‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNature‚Äôs God‚Äù ‚ÄìDeclaration of Independence‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúDeus, sive Natura‚Äù (God, or Nature) ‚ÄìSpinozaAnyway, as you know, Ethan Allen and Thomas Jefferson did not kill themselves, as your theory predicts.

                Jefferson was perhaps a kind of Deist, but he called himself a Unitarian, and quoted the Bible at length. Over fifty percent of Unitarians nowadays refer to themselves as not believing in God at all. Atheists. Some of us don‚Äôt seem to live long enough to see the fruition of our ideas in ourselves. It is for future generations to find out. You shall know them by their fruits.

                    Sorry, no ‚Äúperhaps;‚Äù  Patrick Henry‚Äôs widow referred to ‚Äúthe Grate Jefferson &amp; all the Heroes of the Deistical party‚Äù in 1799.  Furthermore, Jefferson would refer to you as an atheist‚Äîor rather a demonist, if you insist on believing in Old Scratch &amp; Friends as a powerful beings who compete and/or cooperate with God.‚ÄúI concur with you strictly in your opinion of the comparative merits of atheism and demonism, and really see nothing but the latter in the being worshipped by many who think themselves Christians.‚Äù -Thomas Jefferson, letter to Richard Price, January, 8, 1789Dualistic Zoroastrianism tried to split God into two competing entities (which Judeo-Christianity plagiarized,) but only God, the Monistic (i.e., ‚ÄúUnitarian‚Äù in Jefferson‚Äôs words) Laws of Nature and of Nature‚Äôs God, exists.‚ÄúI rejoice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief, which has surrendered its conscience to neither kings or priests, the genuine doctrine of only one God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die a Unitarian.‚Äù -Thomas Jefferson, (letter to Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, June 26, 1822)So Jefferson believed in ‚Äúthe genuine doctrine of only one God,‚Äù and was not an atheist. Anyway, funny seeing a fellow styling himself as a teapartydoc lying about the Founders of our nation by some strained guilt-by-association. Did you pick that technique up from CNN?

                        Largely agreed, but Christianity isn‚Äôt dualist like Zoroastrianism or Manicheism. Every time that idea comes up, or some Gnostic variant, organized Christianity gets very upset.Normative Christianities are quite clear that hell‚Äôs CEO is not coequal with god, nor like god an uncreated and eternal being.Of course, that wasn‚Äôt required for Jefferson to object to the way those concepts DID exist in Christianity, or for him to object to the idea of god coming to earth in the form of his own son, a notion IIRC Jefferson also objected to quite strongly.Of course, time marches on. Looking at nature from the perspective of the 21st century, it‚Äôs hard to imbue physics, chemistry and biology with any moral law or ethical content, and it‚Äôs getting almost as hard now to imagine a great maker as it was for Jefferson to imagine that maker had come to earth, incarnate. The Deist notions of the creator and natural law are as supernatural as any other religion.

                            You do make a good observation that many apologists try to deny the influence of Zoroastrian dualism by defining dualism very narrowly as God and Satan being equally powerful; however, Zoroastrian dualism has been heavily influential on Jewish and Christian belief systems, and the honest theologian acknowledges the influence. See Chapter 4: ‚ÄúThe Devil, the Demons, and the End of the World‚Äù in Gregory Riley‚Äôs text ‚ÄúThe River of God: A New History of Christian Origins.‚Äù (HarperCollins, 2001)

                                ‚ÄúAtheist‚Äù is a pejorative term because the more someone identifies as an Atheist, the more obnoxious and insufferable they are. Atheists, like Muslims, are tolerable only to the extent of their Indifference to their subscribed ideology. The comparison suffers of course because Muslims are allowed to choose between killing infidels or converting them. An atheist will only want to convert you, although given enough of their attention you may want to kill yourself.

Talking about that, do you realize St. Paul was a confirmed cocksucker? That‚Äôs right, he couldn‚Äôt keep his mouth off a young traveling companion‚Äôs genitals, as recorded in Acts 16:3. And yes, Paul, if he followed Jewish tradition, used his mouth just like all the rest of the Jewish babydick suckers.

            The effects of historical Christianity, in particular its morality (or perhaps a travesty of its morality?) linger even after it recedes as a public force and factor. In fact, such subterranean after-Christianity may be particularly pernicious.Look at the Lefties, the Greenies etc. everywhere: While they reject overt Christianity, they practice and want to enforce a travesty of it, with their ostentatious hyper-morality (of which they studiously ignore the costs) and all that. At the same time, forgiveness and an end to guilt have completely been removed from this twisted heresy. The resulting carcass of a secular ‚Äúreligion‚Äù reduces everything to endloess ‚Äúmoral‚Äù demands but has stripped out the supernatural. So you have to atone, and atone again, and atone again more, with no end in sight.

                The Lefties often espouse cherry-picked Christian concepts such as love and tolerance but live as degenerates. Religious tradition can be an antidote that binds and empowers us.

            Socialism murdered many, many times more people in one century, the 20th century (more than 100 million killed, by most counts), than all the inquisitions and ‚Äúwars of religion‚Äù fought by Christians in the last 2,000 years. Statistically, Islam and atheistic socialism are the deadliest ideologies known to man.

        White society was not achieved through ‚Äúwine tastings and ice cream socials, but rather through the pillaging of life, liberty, labor and land.‚Äù In short, through three centuries of kidnapping, torture, murder and rape. Broken teeth, broken bones and broken spirits. Families ripped apart. Children taken from their parents. Men humiliated in front of their wives. Women brutalized within earshot of their husbands. Lash after bloody lash on bare backs. Then, sleep on a bare wooden floor. No doctor, no dentist, no nothing. Just non-stop misery with a few hymns on Sunday.And they think things will be different if they rouse to wrath the folks who did this to them before?Not too smart if they really believe their own propaganda.

        ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt Vietnam, Smoky. This is bowling.  There are rules‚Äù
As pointed below, everyone can‚Äôt be given a free one way helicopter ride so there has to be some combination of a ‚Äúworld of pain‚Äù with a broader societal rejection of the methods of the ‚Äúanti-racists‚Äù.  I‚Äôve found simply laughing at them to be effective.  They expect you to get mad and mimic their behavior in return.  Ridicule works.  Most lack any sense of humor to so their ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù goes into loop.

            This is why I adored Andrew Breitbart. He was a happy warrior who totally messed with their heads!This video is very dated, since Breitbart of course had a big falling out with Glenn Beck, but it‚Äôs a must-watch because of the way Andrew just DESTROYED these herd-mind lefties. He freaked ‚Äôem out so much, they got on their bus and left, to get away from him!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84y-PgaXJ8w

        ‚ÄúThe anti-racists would merrily round up white people and kill them‚Äù
That won‚Äôt last long.
The brakes don‚Äôt have to be some kind of political philosophy, or a religion. A piece of hardware, like a battle rifle in a lot of hands, will do the job just fine. Personally I don‚Äôt think it will really even start. There is a hell of a lot of difference between wailing and gnashing of teeth, and going into battle. Fear is the limiting principle.

        Well, the anit-racists are certainly alive and well today.
Here‚Äôs some info on these terrorists‚Äô plans to disrupt the Trump inauguration:
http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/17/definitive-field-guide-black-bloc-terrorist-want-shut-trump-inauguration/
Breitbart.com has been on this like white on rice (pun intended) ever since the Chicago attacks that shut down Trump‚Äôs rally.
These fuckers mean bidness. They are paying some of these dirtbags $2500 to show up, get trained and cause mayhem. I hope some heads will roll and perhaps bring some RICO and interstate crime charges as well.

        An astute observation ‚ÄúRadicalism always starts as a rejection of something. It never ends at a clearly defined point. There‚Äôs no limiting principle.‚Äù  That is truth.  And there is no limit on the things that can be rejected.  Everything has come under attack as the American Way has been put under siege and declared ‚Äúobsolete‚Äù Constitution, Religion, Civil Rights, God, and going to the bathroom.  Leave it to the Administrative State, ala Ayn Rand to want to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù all aspects of the glorious utopia that can be delivered if only all the Deplorables would just shut up and sit still.But to Zman‚Äôs point that ‚ÄúThere is not point at which one clearly passes from the state of sin to the state of virtue. Instead, virtue is the running from sin,‚Äù I would disagree.  I do not see The Left so much running ‚Äúfrom‚Äù sin as embracing it and wanting to see how far they can take their depravity.  How much can they destroy of what others created.  A different version of the Islamic Horde who do not create anything (ok, maybe they did a millennia ago), but on kill and destroy today.  These people do not go to some unpopulated or under-developed region of the world and start their utopia from scratch but want to undo the creation of a society that has surpassed everything before it.  Sure there are problems with this America but why wouldn‚Äôt there be, it is all man made.  But it is better than anything else devised by man.What we are witnessing now, with the ‚Äúprotests‚Äù of the recent election, are emblematic of the mental illness that pervades our society.  There no longer is a sense of shame, of decorum, of respect for customs, processes or fellow citizens.  I tell you I was sick at the twice elected Barry Soetoro by idiots but I did not protest, block traffic, or do damage to private property.  I had to suck it up and accept the stupidity that was on display by so many of my fellow citizens.  I was so disgusted, I voted with my feet and left.  I have been a expat for more than nine years now.  God willing I will be able to return to the mainland if some semblance of order and propriety is restored now that the Adults are in charge again.

        Anti-racism is a Christian concept, as Nietzsche observed:‚ÄúChristianity, sprung from Jewish roots and comprehensible only as a growth on this soil, represents the counter-movement to any morality of breeding, of race, privilege: it is the anti-Aryan religion par excellence. Christianity‚Äîthe revaluation of all Aryan values, the victory of chandala values, the gospel preached to the poor and base, the general revolt of all the downtrodden, the wretched, the failures, the less favored, against ‚Äòrace:‚Äô the undying chandala hatred is disguised as a religion of love.‚Äù (Friedrich Nietzsche ‚Äì Twilight of the Idols, Chap. 6)You can‚Äôt be racist fulfilling the famous International Jew guru‚Äôs Great Commission to go into ‚Äúall nations.‚Äù You can‚Äôt be racist when you convert Ethiopians. (Acts 8:26-40) You can‚Äôt be racist when you elevate blacks to positions of ‚Äúprophets and teachers‚Äù over your family. (Acts 13:1) You are all one in Christ with hundreds of millions of Black Bruvuhs coming over the border with the rest of the Wetbacks.

                Talking of devout Christian elite, I don‚Äôt know anybody in the world other than Angela Merkel‚Äîthe daughter of a Lutheran minister, member of the Evangelical Church of Berlin, and leader of the Christian Democrats‚Äîwho is more Christlike. She resists not evil, she gives her cloke to those who took away her coat, she loves her enemies, she blesses those that curse her people. All done under the very Christian notion that ‚Äúall souls are equal before God,‚Äù as these two scholars have observed:[1] ‚ÄúIn Western societies, the Judeo-Christian image of humankind‚Äîwhether you are a believer or not‚Äîhas secured a minimal moral consensus in everyday life. It has been a major factor in social cohesion. Now that the neurosciences have irrevocably dissolved the Judeo-Christian image of a human being as containing an immortal spark of the divine, we are beginning to realize that they have not substituted anything that could hold society together and provide a common ground for shared moral intuitions and values.‚Äù p. 297 ‚ÄìThomas Metzinger, The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self. (Basic Books, 2009)[2] ‚ÄúThe liberal belief in the free and sacred nature of each individual is a direct legacy of the traditional Christian belief in the free and eternal souls. Without recourse to eternal souls and a Creator God, it becomes embarrassingly difficult for liberals to explain what is so special about individual Sapiens. [‚Ä¶] The idea that all humans are equal is a revamped version of the monotheist conviction that all souls are equal before God.‚Äù p. 231 ‚ÄìYuval Harari, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. (Harper Collins, 2015)The myth of a magical ‚Äúsoul‚Äù that is universally worthy of being ‚Äúsaved‚Äù is driver of ‚ÄúRefugees Welcome.‚Äù

                    Salvation by a Creator is the myth.(Although the Supreme Daddy is a natural neural construct.)
Souls are not, they are as natural a phenomenon as a kidney.Traditional religious questioning still has trouble isolating components.

                        The Christian notion of souls is set in direct opposition to atomic theory, as popularized by Epicurus. St. Paul mocked the idea that there are atomic elements, such as in Galatians 4:9, and again ridicules the theory of atoms in 1 Corinthians 15:52. (en atom≈ç, en rhipƒì ophthalmou: in an instant, in twinkling of an eye (wink, wink!)) Dewitt explains why Atomic Theory is so ‚Äúoffensive and provocative‚Äù to St. Paul concept of the eternal soul below:_______________It was the logic of the cross against the logic of the atom, an early phase of the long strife between science and religion.[‚Ä¶]The whole theory of physics was reduced by Epicurus to Twelve Elementary Principles and a syllabus bearing this title was published for the use of his disciples. This list of Principles, it may be interposed, was the most lucid and orderly ever drawn up in ancient times, and with one exception would have been received with respect down to the date of an event so recent as the fission of the atom. By way of illustration the first seven are here listed with some adaptation to modern terminology:1. Matter is uncreatable.2. Matter is indestructible.3. The universe consists of atoms and space.4. All existing things are either atoms or compounds of atoms.5. The atoms are infinite in multitude.6. Space is infinite in extent.7. The atoms are always in action.As was bound to happen, this whole system became known to the enemies of Epicurus by that particular Principle which was most offensive and provocative of ridicule, the third. This was offensive because it implied that the soul of man itself was composed of atoms, just as the body itself, and therefore subject to dissolution, just as the body. It was especially open to ridicule because the atoms were such insignificant things upon which to base a whole system of knowledge. In Galatians 4:9 Paul sneered at them as ‚Äúthe weak and beggarly elements.‚Äù[‚Ä¶]Under the name of elements the atoms are mentioned six times in the New Testament, three times simply as elements and three times as ‚Äúelements of the universe,‚Äù an unmistakable recognition of the third Elementary Principle of Epicurus: ‚ÄúThe universe consists of atoms and space.‚ÄùNorman Dewitt, ‚ÄúSt. Paul and Epicurus.‚Äù (University of Minnesota Press, 1954)http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816662135

                                    I think you be missing the forest through the trees T.  You may be bringing up something I did not know, but it is not the significant part of message of the Bible, especially of the New Testament.  You quibble about minutiae and ignore the larger message.The issue is about Free Will and each person/soul/creation having the opportunity to accept the Word of God.  If you choose to ignore, reject that message, so be it.  Your exercise of your free will.  The Church, Religion, is made up of humans, people who at one point in their lives choose to put their faith in a Savior that is described in the Bible.  People are not perfect.  Being a Christian does not make you perfect.  It makes you a Christ Follower.  And Followers too wander from the path of truth and righteousness.  Take care of your own path and don‚Äôt throw stones at everyone else for their beliefs.

                    ‚ÄúThe myth of a magical ‚Äúsoul‚Äù that is universally worthy of being ‚Äúsaved‚Äù is driver of ‚ÄúRefugees Welcome.‚ÄùThis is precisely wrong. Saving souls does not have the slightest thing to do with changing material circumstances, which is the stated moral basis of the so-called ‚Äúrefugee crisis‚Äù. Merkel‚Äôs religion is materialism, which is pretty much what you‚Äôd expect from someone raised under Communism. Modern communism of course represents the purest political expression of the elevation of material world and the negation of anything spiritual. Since the 1950s the Catholic Church hierarchy has been infiltrated by various flavors of Modernism, the latest version being Liberation Theology, an implicitly Marxist sect of which Bergoglio has long been a member, which explains why that venerable institution has veered into a ditch since Vatican 2.

                        A Lutheran Christian Democrat as Communist? No surprise at all. As Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises observed, ‚Äúprimitive Christianity is Bolshevism.‚Äù (Socialism, p. 413)Mises further observes: ‚ÄúJesus‚Äôs words are full of resentment against the rich, and the Apostles are no meeker in this respect. The Rich Man is condemned because he is rich, the Beggar praised because he is poor‚Ä¶. In God‚Äôs Kingdom the poor shall be rich, but the rich shall be made to suffer. Later revisers have tried to soften the words of Christ against the rich ‚Ä¶ but there is quite enough left to support those who incite the world to hatred of the rich, revenge, murder and arson‚Ä¶. This is a case in which the Redeemer‚Äôs words bore evil seed. More harm has been done, and more blood shed, on account of them than by the persecution oaf heretics and the burning of witches. They have always rendered the Church defenceless against all movements which aim at destroying human society. The church as an organization has certainly always stood on the side of those who tried to ward off communistic attack. But it ‚Ä¶ was continually disarmed by the words: ‚ÄòBlessed be ye poor; for yours is the Kingdom of God.‚Äô‚Äù (Socialism, p. 420)To supplement the passages Mises uses, I‚Äôll add a few passages that confirms Mises‚Äô opinion, under two headings, as follows:(1.) Bolshevists despise the successful:‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúBut woe unto you that are rich!‚Äù Luke 6:24‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSell all your possessions and give the money to the poor.‚Äù Matthew 19:21, Mark 10:21, Luke 18:22‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.‚Äù Matthew 19:24, Mark 10:25, Luke 18:25‚Äú‚Ä¶guard against all kinds of greed, life does not consist in abundance‚Ä¶fool‚Ä¶‚Äù (Parable of the Rich Fool) Luke 12:13-21‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThere was a rich man‚Ä¶in torment‚Ä¶agony‚Ä¶remember that in your lifetime you received your good things‚Ä¶‚Äù (The Rich Man and Lazarus) Luke 16:19-31(2.) Bolshevists are collectivists:‚Ä¢ ‚Äú‚Ä¶each according to his ability.‚Äù Matthew 25:15‚Ä¢ ‚Äú‚Ä¶not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them.‚Äù Acts 4:32‚Ä¢ ‚Äú‚Ä¶and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.‚Äù Acts 4:35‚Ä¢ ‚Äú‚Ä¶the daily distribution.‚Äù Acts 6:1‚Ä¢ ‚Äú‚Ä¶your liberal distribution‚Ä¶‚Äù 2 Corinthians 9:13I appreciate that you a Christian are against Communism, and that you have developed all sorts of creative interpretations to tamp down what the Bible says, but unfortunately, it still says what it says. The ‚ÄúLiberation Theology‚Äù is in there. And a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.I‚Äôd further observe that the invasive cult of Christianity worked in Europe best when all but a few priests were prohibited from reading the Bolshevist Scriptures, and cultural ‚ÄúTradition‚Äù was held in equal esteem as the Bible. I suppose that is why so many ‚ÄúDeus Vult‚Äù types LARP to an era of Christianity before the printing press.

                            The Devil himself can quote scripture to suit his purposes, and for all the enlightenment Mises brought to the field of economics, his interpretation of scripture leaves plenty to be desired. Jesus used the rich as his punching bag because their wealth is generally the fruit of their love of the material world. He would challenge the rich to sell their goods and give them to the poor because it would force them to sacrifice the material for the spiritual, something that most of them cannot bear to do‚Äì hence the observation about camels. The idea that Jesus was making a moral judgment against the rich simply for the sake of their wealth is absurd, because that would be covetous and thus in defiance of the Tenth Commandment. The idea that the Son of God would specifically enjoin covetousness is absurd to the point of heresy.Of course, not all rich people are slaves to the material world. Jesus recognized this when He said, ‚Äúblessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù In this way He includes those wealthy folks who are humble enough to realize that the need for the spiritual trumps the need for the material.As far as the collectivism of the early church is concerned, it makes sense in context. A small group of persecuted people facing the overwhelming secular authority of the Roman Empire would need to pool their resources and act collectively in order to survive. It‚Äôs a valuable lesson for any small group facing an existential threat. Three men trapped in a foxhole under enemy fire are going to pool their ammunition because it makes sense to have all guns firing as long as possible.

                            The ‚Äúcollectivists‚Äù in the book of Acts were in a VOLUNTARY community ‚Äî by their own individual choice. And they did NOT try to impose their sharing of common goods on anybody else. Monastic communities do that to this day. And you will notice that all monasteries have their own cottage industries by which they support themselves.Once again, there is a difference between what Christians may choose to do within their own communities, and what people FORCE on others through the power of the government. The two should not be confused. The fact that so many modern Christians sympathize with the political Left just shows that they are extremely misguided.

                            T, Read the 10 Commandments and try to understand how Jesus was judging ‚Äúthe rich.‚Äù  Whether it was the rich of his time, the rich of the Industrial age (Robber Barron‚Äôs), or today‚Äôs rich, Apple‚Äôs shareholders who use slave labor in far away countries, albeit done by surrogates like FoxConn, to skirt labor laws and financial regulations (i.e. taxes), there are many ‚Äúrich‚Äù who became so because of their treatment of their fellow man.  This does not have anything to do with ‚Äúfairness‚Äù or ‚Äúequality‚Äù but everything to do with a predatory nature driven by greed that places value on wealth above all else.  And in our case today, it has morphed into a state where ‚Äúnations‚Äù and ‚Äúnationalism‚Äù are threats to that wealth because the drive for quarterly profits means continued and more stringent abuses of people and rights all in the unending search for profits.You paint Jesus as a liberal lunatic.  He was an example of truth, honesty and righteousness on display for all to see and the story told in the Bible for posterity.  Turning over the tables of the money lenders in the Temple was his way of showing his disdain and anger at the business practices in the House of Worship and where the Sadducee‚Äôs and Pharisees who were supposed to uphold the law.

You take little facts and make mountains out of them as if you are some kind of philosopher who understands all things, especially Christianity.  Go find yourself for you are lost and are trying to drag others down with you.

                    Steel T Post,I could not disagree with you more. I believe with every fiber of my being that human beings are created in the image and likeness of God.That belief does NOT lead me to abase myself for being white, nor to embrace America‚Äôs suicide through political correctness, mass immigration and Islamization.Things have gotten confused because people misinterpret Jesus‚Äôs words, which were directed AT INDIVIDUALS, to be prescriptions for government policies.

                    Bullshit. Globalization is the driver for this. Flood the labor pool and wipe out wage supports, force people into brutal competition for the few jobs available.  Problem is, is that the replacement people ‚Äìmainly Africans and Muslims are savages and have a extreme propensity to violence and tribalism which makes integration futile.I know you Christian bashers can‚Äôt help yourselves, but the corporations have been the primary drivers of open borders in the world. Christianity or should I say what‚Äôs left of it, is a spent faith. It‚Äôs all but dead in Western Europe replaced by post-modernism and socialism as the peoples new gods. Christianity has no hold among intellectuals, managerial class or monied types. These types all tend to sail under the flag of the Jolly Roger where everything goes and are the main promoters of open borders and globalization.What remains of Christianity is mostly found among the lower white classes who have little in terms of power and influence.

                        ‚ÄúAll Nations‚Äù Globalism is indeed the driver. Never read Jesus‚Äô ‚ÄúGreat Commission?‚Äù Never read how Christians started recruiting blacks right from the start (Acts 8:26-40) and elevating them to be ‚Äúprophets and teachers? (Acts 13:1)And yes, Christianity still has a stranglehold on the Leftist Cathedral.‚ÄúThe liberal belief in the free and sacred nature of each individual is a direct legacy of the traditional Christian belief in the free and eternal souls. Without recourse to eternal souls and a Creator God, it becomes embarrassingly difficult for liberals to explain what is so special about individual Sapiens. [‚Ä¶] The idea that all humans are equal is a revamped version of the monotheist conviction that all souls are equal before God.‚Äù p. 231 ‚ÄìYuval Harari, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.

                            Man, you sure like to talk out your ass!  Liberals do NOT believe in individuality or free and eternal souls.  They hate Christianity as it espouses free will and dedication to a higher power rather than fealty to the collective.  The liberal treats all like interchangeable parts in the Borg hive.  Indistinct.  Worthless.  Expendable.  Where the hell have you been for the past decades?

                        Excellent description of the ‚Äúgreed is good‚Äù class.  Everything in life needs balance and that includes having a portfolio of interests and concerns but as a certain class of people have demonstrated to all, they have only one goal.  Power.  And that comes through money.  And the goal of Power is Control.The only point I would disagree with is the strength of Christianity residing mostly in the lowerwhite classes.  I think what we saw with the election of PE Trump, was based largely on the under lying tenets of Christianity.  Those things that most people find repulsive and disagreeable over the past decades can be traced to the foundation of the Ten Commandments.  That is the bedrock of social order and progress.  Without that, we have what Obama and the Left tried to create ‚Ä¶ chaos.  Time to re-institute some controls and feedback loops into the system so people can act civilized again.  We have been degenerating to the lowest common denominator which is what has been described here as the violent prone, uneducated migrants who seek only to destroy and have no desire to integrate/blend and help build and improve things.
