        This comment would probably be better suited for an email, but alas, I can not find any good way to contact you.  I find your views intriguing, brilliant, and sometimes insane.What is curious to me is that you seem to have all the foundations of a free and empirically minded thinker but also possess some egregiously incorrect views.  Further, in much of your writing you tout a freedom from group-think and the cultish mentality which most of humanity takes up over some particular dogma or another.  For this reason, I rather enjoy and respect much of your work here.I fancy myself a similar sort of thinker, and often blast people of all different sorts of ideologies in a manner not unlike your work in this blog.  I find it strange that you and I can disagree on so much when we appear to be coming from the same sort of epistemological framework.  I’d wager that you have a good deal more raw knowledge than me, both of the historic and political types, so I’m willing to be charitable to your views and try to learn from them.With that concession, it’s hard to imagine how you have come to some of your beliefs.  You appear to have a great faith in evolutionary psychology, especially as it pertains to gender roles.  But I am highly skeptical of this very new field of science; very little of what I’ve read has been grounded in good empirical work.Further, you are against Gay-marriage.  Being charitable, I suspect you mean to say something like: marriage is state-recognized for the sole purpose of promoting fertility, which gay people necessarily cannot participate in, therefore, it does not make sense  for gay marriage to be state recognized.  Would I be correct in saying this?  Or do you think gay couples should be deprived other rights which heterosexual couples enjoy, such as hospital visitation rights and adoption?In general, I’d like you to expound on your view on evolutionary psychology, gender roles, and homosexuality.  You are of course free to tell me to fuck off.  But I’ve read 25 pages of this blog and feel unsatisfied with your exposition on these topics, so it’d be great if you could indulge me a bit.
