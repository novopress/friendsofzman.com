        Look at the thing with James Watson. The left are trying to unperson the world‚Äôs most influential living scientist, THE DISCOVERER OF DNA, because he has correctly pointed out that different races have different IQ‚Äôs.
Watson vs. the totalitarian left-wing cult is the contemporary equivalent of Galileo vs. the Catholic church. I‚Äôve never seen such a crystalline, textbook case of truth vs. power.

        It seems to me that the other side is also greatly exposed here. In an unstable social environment, how long before people on our side begin to take subversive action? The names, addresses, employers, and movements of many on the other side are not difficult to acquire. If one day we find some of them dead in a ditch with a warning message stuffed into their mouths, will this give the SJW pause‚Ä¶or portend a more sinister phase in our history?

            False equivalency. They are completely unexposed to a counter salvo because they have total control of the organs of power.The ‚Äòman with the gun‚Äô is in charge, period. And the State with its official Religion of MuliCult, its God named Diversity and all the layers of state applied force, courts, judges, police, HR depts, etc. chant the party line.Your doxxing has no power here because YOU have no power here. An attempted right wing dox would simply backfire on you spectacularly as you‚Äôd be shown to be the hateful bigot you are for not taking it on the chin as you are suppose to.Just in case it isn‚Äôt clear: You will not talk or vote your way out of this any longer.

                I agree with Apex Predator. Doxxing someone from the NYT or Huffpo will have next-to no impact on them but could rebound on you very badly. Whoever did the doxxing could find themselves facing criminal charges ranging from threatening behaviour all the way up to and including attempted murder. Expect exemplary sentences (419 years?).
The institutions are no longer neutral arbiters.

            Epaminondas ‚Äì your points are true and valid, but have been so for a number of years now and . . . crickets.  Various members of Antifa have been publicly ID‚Äôd and have not lost employment or freedom or putative friends.  On the contrary, they‚Äôve been feted and been provided with further resources by others on their side.  Where are the wealthy nationalists providing bail money or lawyers for the Charlottesville thought criminals languishing in prison?  Where are the White voices publicly supporting the latest Becky for calling the cops on Negroes To Whom No Rules Apply?I‚Äôll tell you where they all are ‚Äì being publicly and vociferously warned off, by other putative thought criminals.  Call them cucks, boomers, whatever you wish ‚Äì but these evil traitors are everywhere.  I cannot tolerate even walking into your average church anymore because of the virtue signalling cult of nice, which honors Molly Tibbetts‚Äô mother for the willing sacrifice of her own child and her replacement by the alien ‚Äòyoung‚Äô that terminated her life.  I‚Äôve stopped commenting at Sailer (and severely cut back my reading there) because of the hundreds-strong comment threads peopled by these same ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô traitorous pseudo-Whites.  I find them at every website I peruse.I‚Äôve been hoping for years now for right-wing death squads or at least a lone sniper or two, all for nought.  Despairing?  You betcha.  Not of God, but of men.

PS  Nothing in this post advocates actual sniping (or other harmful acts) directed at any of our fellow human beings.

        This is the great weakness of the Dinduist religion and their social justice theocracy. Every lasting religion and regime has a way for heretics to atone, to wipe the slate clean and rejoin the system. Henry IV came to Canossa. Deng Xiaoping was rehabilitated. Even ISIS left you alone if you paid the Jizya or converted.In the Social Justice theocracy you are guilty. Period. And can never be rehabilitated. In addition, its becoming easier and easier to be unpersoned and placed outside the system.So it is creating a growing class of outsiders with no stake in the system and no way to rise in status. Its literally building its own opposition.

                It really is a religion, a kind of secular hinduism with inherited karma and castes. Except in dinduism, blackness is the supreme object of worship as it is the purest form of Karma.

            This is my case actually. Very high functioning alpha male white guy who was a successful consultant. I made the mistake of getting verbally hostile with a brown fella who was running his mouth and being hostile towards me. I had no concept of how far gone we are when this happened. The scales of justice are so lopsided now its a complete farce.Next thing I know one of those little midnight raids descended upon my residence. Lots of well armed WHITE men doing the State‚Äôs bidding. The only thing this cunt had to do was run to the police ‚ÄúA white guy who is a obvious racist has me in fear of my life.‚ÄùThe hounds of hell were unleashed on me. They tore my house apart threw grenades around,  stole everything that wasn‚Äôt nailed down, pointed machineguns at me, locked me in a cage, and slapped lots of charges on me, mostly fabricated.There are a growing number of ‚Äúme‚Äù in the world and I‚Äôll simply quote Fight Club here- ‚ÄúIt is only once you‚Äôve lost everything that you are free to do anything.‚ÄùIf you strip a man of his livelihood and ability to earn and produce, you give him LOTS of free time and little hope. For high IQ white men with an axe to grind? Well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll let you figure the rest out. This falls under ‚ÄòBe Careful What you Wish For‚Äô.

                Is this true? If so, I‚Äôm so sorry. I don‚Äôt understand how one‚Äôs thoughts and comments can end up translating into police raids on the house. Sounds like we‚Äôre as bad as the U.K., even though we used to have a Bill of Rights to protect free thought and speech.

                    Unfortunately, that story is very true and should serve as a warning about how bad the situation really is. This guy wanted to inflict maximum damage to me and he succeeded in ways that even stunned me.In a normal world this would have been a conflict handled between two men somehow. In Clown World, this brown guy ran to the police  as his first line of defense and I paid a tragically heavy price.In a world where a man can get 400 years in jail for something that was at worse, an accident. Or possibly didn‚Äôt even happen at all, this should not surprise you. We are at war, many just aren‚Äôt aware of it yet because the shooting hasn‚Äôt started‚Ä¶

                        It wasn‚Äôt an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù. Fields committed murder.
There was a lot of judicial atrocity in the aftermath of Charlottesville, and people are in jail who should never have been charged. Defending Fields obscures that point.

                    The brown ‚Äúvictim‚Äù simply told the cops something that prompted them to raid the man‚Äôs house and all the rest of it. If a citizen makes a certain kind of complaint, the cops *have* to take it seriously and act on it. It was all a lie, no doubt, but the cops didn‚Äôt know that.Same thing happened to me but it was from another white man who was miffed that I turned down an ‚Äúoffer‚Äù he made to me. Went to jail Three times in court. Ended up costing me roughly $5000 and two years of my life. All anybody has to do is to LIE to the cops.

‚ÄúThe Khmer Rouge leadership boasted over the state-controlled radio that only one or two million people were needed to build the new agrarian socialist utopia. As for the others, as their proverb put it: ‚ÄúTo keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss‚Äù.‚Äùhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot

We live in a society where blacks consider it acceptable to physically assault anyone guilty of racism, and minority grievances are cultivated by institutes of higher indoctrination.

        De-programming white normie is like an archaeological dig: you‚Äôve got to scrape and brush for years, and even if you finally make it, it‚Äôs often just a worthless pottery shard anyway.I‚Äôve got cousins in small and medium-sized towns in the Midwest with guns up the wazoo, but they just don‚Äôt get it. They know, unlike the New York Times, that black people ‚Äúaren‚Äôt too bright,‚Äù but they unthinkingly assume that we can somehow work it all out.Some of those Mexican fellows on the worksite work real hard. That nice black lady walked Gramma around the hospital yard.They‚Äôre too optimistic for their own good. They just don‚Äôtsee, even if you try to show them, the termites relentlessly gnawing away at our freedoms and our civilization 24/7.If people don‚Äôt wake up, it‚Äôs going to be a great paradox‚Äìand chapter title‚Äìof future history books:How the Most-Armed Nation in History was Conquered without a Single Shot Fired.

            I have some friends who are flag-waving, enthusiastic MAGA Trump-supporters all the way, and they still don‚Äôt quite understand how close our freedoms are to being shut down.Of course they want the wall, and hate the crazy liberals and all the rest of it.  But so much of their concerns are on things like getting the blacks to vote republican, including pointing out that ‚ÄúDems are the real racists‚Äù and focusing on all the ways the Dems are hypocrites, and that illegal is bad, but legal is good.When I point out, for example, the James Fields 419 year sentence, there‚Äôs not much response from them. They think it‚Äôs bad that Alex Jones was banned, but it doesn‚Äôt get their blood boiling or anything.  When I mention the others (badthinkers) banned, their eyes kind of glaze over, since they probably think they‚Äôre just fringe voices, and not that important like Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh are.

            Babe, they are white people still trying to live in white-created high-trust society. They, like so many millions of Americans, do not yet realize that we are now a low-trust society, after 50 years of importing 10s of millions of low-IQ third-world people from incompatible cultures (this reality is played down or hidden from whites by our lying, antagonistic (((media)))). This inherent goodness in whites is at the same time a huge, vulnerable flaw that is constantly exploited by all the other races, who do not, if you will, have an ‚Äúinner compass‚Äù like whites do. I picked up the ‚Äúinner compass‚Äù idea from this essay I read recently: ‚ÄúA Nigerian‚Äôs View of Race‚Äùhttps://www.amren.com/features/2018/12/a-nigerians-view-of-race/:‚ÄúThere is something unusual about the psychological makeup of white people. It can be metaphorically described as an inner compass. Due to that inner compass, white people need very little external force or punishment. They do not need much policing, so people can apply their potential to useful activities rather than wasting time donning a uniform and swinging a night-stick.‚ÄúThe absence of this inner compass is why, in Nigeria, no number of police officers can enforce traffic laws at an intersection. Indeed, most traffic enforcers and police officers routinely break the laws they are supposed to uphold (and still insist on taking a bribe at every random stop).‚ÄúWhile this inner compass has tremendous advantages for white society, one disadvantage is that members of that inwardly guided culture are prone to tremendous torments of conscience that make them vulnerable to manipulation. There seems to be a miasma of guilt inherent to the very fabric of Western culture, a feeling of inadequacy for failing to measure up to one‚Äôs internal yardstick.‚ÄùPathological altruism. Suicidal altruism. While at the same time we can thank God for making us so good.

        A key difference between the current/future situation and the Cultural Revolution is, in the case of GPCR it was Chinese people doing it to their fellow Chinese.  Granted there were class resentments and ancient grudges and insane ideology, but still, they were all Chinese.This situation is far riskier, because the imported class of Third World shock troops and commissars have no shared history or fellow-feeling for their intended future victims.  They are George III‚Äôs Hessian mercenaries.  This situation is far more analogous to Germany 1933, where there was a gradual but steady ramping-up of deliberate dehumanizations, de-legitimizing and slow institutionalizing of the mechanisms of murder prior to the main action.  The proliferation of nonsense like ‚Äúwhiteness studies‚Äù on campuses is a precursor to things like a ‚Äúwhiteness tax‚Äù and worse.There‚Äôs not going to be any living with these people as neighbors or fellow citizens.  Partition needs to be seriously discussed in its practical nuts and bolts.Btw the NYT story is, predictably, a train wreck of bad writing.  What precisely did this kid actually do?  Did he just make nasty remarks on Anglin‚Äôs site, or did he actually stalk and harass this girl personally?  Did he make any credible personal threats?  We don‚Äôt hear.Also, ‚Äúbananas hanging from nooses‚Äù is just waaaay too much.  Sounds like the key foreign export of Hatehoaxistan to me.

        You said it before in a previous post. We can‚Äôt play by their rules, we should have no interest in learning them ‚Äì we must play on their vices. The lesson here is: Don‚Äôt expose your identity on the internet, stupid.We need to infiltrate their operation and sabotage it.

            I would also argue that doing things like hanging bananas from nooses is just stupid.  Roseanne got run off her own show for doing stuff like this ‚Äì I think it was ridiculous that it happened to her, but I also think that the insults she was flinging around were sophomoric at best.If we‚Äôre going to troll them ‚Äì then at least be better at it.For instance:  On one of the gun sites I frequent there was a guy active for a long time who ‚Äì whenever some leftist would start mouthing off ‚Äì would just comment back:‚ÄúCongratulations ‚Äì you‚Äôre on the list‚ÄùI‚Äôve often used a variation of that to insert comments into threads where leftists are making comments about supporting whatever the latest government sponsored welfare state giveaway is.My version goes something like this:‚ÄúYou know sooner or later ‚Äì all of this welfare crap is going to blow up.  Then ‚Äì as this is what ALWAYS happens,  all of the useful idiot crowd will start getting uppity when the checks stop coming. Then ‚Äì as this is what OFTEN happens ‚Äì government will clamp down severely.  People will be picked up and thrown in camps, or taken on helicopter rides.  You see the oppressive governments of the old days ‚Äì Nazis and the Soviets ‚Äì at least knew that they simply could not keep their enterprise going with a whole bunch of people on the dole. So they got rid of them.  Our modern day liberals ‚Äì are just stupid.  They think the free money will run forever ‚Äì it won‚Äôt.  It will run out ‚Äì and then they‚Äôll find out that their names are already on the government‚Äôs list as PROVEN useless eaters.  So congratulations dummy ‚Äì you‚Äôre on the list. Hope you like your short stay at the camp‚ÄùYou always rewrite a version of that to indict women like the one in the NY Times article and sow that seed of fear into their hamster brain.Juvenile insults are just juvenile insults IMHO.  I prefer to sow actual fear ‚Äì in such a way that it can‚Äôt be easily cast as something personal ‚Äì but rather just a casual ‚Äúobservation‚Äù

                You assume an objective target in an honest debate. This has gone way beyond that. They think WE will be going to the camps and falling out of helicopters because we are all Nazis/racists/homophobes/etc. In case you haven‚Äôt noticed they are the ones warning us.I personally think we‚Äôre coming up on time to rack and tap the rifles.

            They  own the HR departments. They own the courts. They own the media, and they own academia.I disagree with the system, but I also work under a fortune 50 company. I don‚Äôt maintain any social media lines since discussion is stifled and it breeds unhealthy narcissism, so how exactly do you expect the system to break, when they control the avenues of communication and commerce? I work and break my back personally so that I can escape the urban hell, but there are few prospects I see for gainful employment when I do break free, and I‚Äôm on the MGTOW as well as nonbeliever side of the redpill, and I don‚Äôt expect to have a family.A man literally lit himself on fire in front of the family court buildings, and not a whisper was heard.

        If you read the left-wing take on these kinds of SJW overreach, they try to say that such incidents are comparatively rare and that the right is making too big a deal of them. But as we see here, the point is that you don‚Äôt need all that many such incidents for them to do the intended work.

        This tale is a perfect example of evolutionary principles and how they ultimately redound to everyone‚Äôs benefit. The outcome of this ordeal is (or should be) that future dissenters will properly perceive that Progressives are maliciously devious and will use every opportunity to attack and destroy anyone they regard as enemy. As such, the lesson that should be learned is to get smarter, anticipate the attack, and proactively counter it. One type of response could be to swallow your anger, go dark and avoid their radar, and then only take action from the shadows. They exploit notoriety. The proper response is to exploit the unknown and unexpected.

        If you participate on the mainstream platforms, you will either self-censor or be banned. There‚Äôs no way around it, the courts are not about to show favoritism to a group of people reviled as ‚Äúdomestic terrorists‚Äù. Juvenile harassment and outright violence will be receiving ‚Äúexemplary sentencing‚Äù. Foundation money will be invested into left-wing ‚Äúderadicalization‚Äù programs. Alternative platforms are worthy of interest, but only nationalization of Big Tech is a durable solution. Thiel and others have long noted the monopolistic nature of the industry.

            ‚Äú‚Ä¶ but only nationalization of Big Tech is a durable solution. ‚ÄùHow is Nationalization any different from Monopoly?It‚Äôs just different ‚Äúowners‚Äù, (the citizens ‚Ä¶ Ha!), with the same lack of ability to direct the elites who control it. New boss, same as the old boss. With nationalization, there will be zero chance of starting up alternatives. We can create alternatives to Big Tech; not so much when the platforms are nationalized.Do you remember when the German Post Office was the sole telephony/internet provider? It Sucked. Do you remember when Minitel was the only network in France? It also sucked.In the same era, the US had AOL.. there were calls to nationalize them also‚Ä¶ but we also had hundreds of smaller competing players.Nationalization is not the answer.

It was a silly act of rebellion. What was going to be accomplished by viciously harassing (snort) some black girl on Twitter? Was this guy new to the planet or at least to Twitter?

            It was beyond silly. It was flat out stupid. You‚Äôre never going to build a poitical movement by spearheading a harrassment campaign against a college kid who, at least according to the NYT, was guilty of nothing more than winning an election for student body president.A quick search reveals that the kid resigned her position as student body president after being suspended from her sorority for unspecified conduct.  There is a suggestion that the banana campaign referenced in the NYT article was a hoax staged in cooperation with another member of her sorority who was also suspended. If the University suppressed the results of an investigation (which is highly likely) then go after the University.

            Yeah, he was a prime doxing target because his songs got some decent play as background music on various alt right YouTube videos. He got doxed when someone went back far enough and discovered a slip up that was found out by someone in his IRL theatre group.  They had to make an example of him because his propaganda was a little too effective.It was shocking at the time because it was supposedly an obscure detail that could have only been found with a real deep dive into his life.  No matter how much attempts at anonymity you make, if they want you, they will get you.

                I dunno.  This girl is being groomed and spotlighted for political office, so she‚Äôs probably from the right family.
I think the story will become a ‚Äúcrucified on a barbed-wire fence in Wyoming‚Äù myth in her David Hogg Instagram moment.  The whole thing was likely a self-promotion stunt.
No, wait.You‚Äôre right.This ‚Äòstupid kid‚Äô, the troller, is just as likely to be in on it, doing a little self promotion of his own, as her ‚Äúfirst follower‚Äù, the one she Brought To The Light.  Tag team?

        A continuation of earlier thoughts on unprofitable media, read this to see the rotten foundations of media finance. A bankrupt conglomerate bailed out by a ‚Äúlucky‚Äù investment in a Chinese ‚Äústartup‚Äù. Quite interesting that this ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù giant is never targeted for nationalization, while humble Afrikaner farmers are.

        Just keep in mind that the worse these examples get, the more good whites will support the left. This example provides them with greater ops to virtue signal and a stronger lesson learned as to what happens if they don‚Äôt go alongIf the Democrats want to insure victory in 2020 they just need to put a bullet in the head of these thought criminals. Voters will ask themselves which side they want to be on. The one that is persecuted even when its supposed side wins or the one who can destroy people with impunity?

        Evan James McCarty now has little to lose. In the past, this all wouldn‚Äôt have mattered. He would have gone through his career and family life as a valuable member of society. Nowadays, he may well became something extremely dangerous. It was never meant to be this way. Everyday right now, men who once wouldn‚Äôt have bothered anyone are being red-pilled and pushed into a corner. We all know this is going to end badly.

        Seriously, what could McCarty possibly think he was accomplishing by joining in that stunt? If he had been keelhauled for doing something smart that would score a real point for the dissident right, he‚Äôd have my sympathy. As it is, I care as much about him as I do for the imbeciles that get killed by falling from great heights while planking. That is to say none.

        I don‚Äôt think any of you are thinking clearly about this.Imagine for a moment that it was not about race, that it was just about some guy organizing an online harassment campaign against some woman over some matter that none of us care about. Would you really be all that upset if she sued his ass and forced a humiliating settlement? I sure wouldn‚Äôt!Don‚Äôt you understand that people like Evan McCarty and Andrew Anglin are poison to any hope of asuccessfulwhite nationalism? The Leftlovespeople like McCarty and (especially!) Anglin, because they repulse respectable white people and in doing so discredit the idea of white identity politics. Here‚Äôs the thing: in order to win, youmustwin over a significant fraction of the white population. And since most white people are respectable, this means you have to find a way to make white identity politics a respectable idea. I think this is doable, but it‚Äôs hard! Hanging bananas from nooses is easy though, so let‚Äôs all go do that. And if some hoaxster hangs them up for us, wonderful, let‚Äôs loudly cheer him on. Let‚Äôs be exactly the kind of nasty assholes the Left keeps telling everyone we are ‚Äî that sounds like a plan to me!

                Yes, I noticed, and a little more detail would have been nice. But does it matter? Unless the whole thing was fabricated, McCarty was in fact involved in an online harassment campaign, and that‚Äôs something that decent people just don‚Äôt do. Ever! If race and politics had not been involved, would you have been disturbed by the lack of detail, and gone to his defense? Or would you just have assumed some basement dwelling idiot had gotten what was coming to him, and moved on to the next story? Can you explain to me any way McCarty‚Äôs actions work in favor of anything you or I care about? I can‚Äôt see him as anything other than a gift to the anti-white Left. And as for Anglin, wow, he is the gift that just keeps on giving and giving and giving!

                    The thing about an online harassment campaign is you can just, you know‚Ä¶ stop looking at your phone.If someone wants compensation for damages there should probably be some sort of actual damages. This is lawlessness, and yeah I‚Äôd be upset about this without the racial element.Dumpson:‚ÄúEverything I‚Äôve done since my freshman year has really been to make sure that we‚Äôre opening and pushing the boundaries for students of color, specifically those who are going to come after me‚ÄùShe‚Äôs like that kid who got into Stanford with that ‚Äúblack lives matter black lives matter‚Äù admissions essay. She wants to be a high-profile, highly paid activist and she knows this is how it‚Äôs done.Note that AU had other banana incidents while Dumpson was a student there, and she resigned from the student body presidency and was suspended by her sorority. Think it‚Äôs possible she was involved? And her sorority got wind of it and wanted to cover themselves with a suspension? And the university knows but they‚Äôre thinking since she graduated and is on the side of Good everyone will just forget about it?

            Damn, you are making way too much sense over here. The Dissident Right loves drama and maudlin poor widdle mah sentimentality. You need to appear respectable to win, even if you are rotten to the core on the inside. The left is a master at this and they win by painting the Right, even the cucked right as a bunch of noose-hanging mean racist nasties who want to take away your health care and ship your jobs overseas.
