        Immanuel Kant, the most influential intellectual of the time, was using the term “race” in the exact same way we do today.This also applies to Hume and Locke, who actually had a direct influence on the Framers.Any reasonably smart person is aware that until recently, “race” had many colloquial usages, like ethnicity (e.g. the English race), or group in general (e.g. that unfortunate race of troglodytes, the gunners of the lower decks).The proper usage of “race” back in the 18th Cent was the one established by Linnaeus, which is the same we have today.This is the first time I see someone imagine that intellectuals from the period were only employing the term as a synonym for “nation”.

            *”The people of this time had different conceptions of race. This is not to say race is a social construct, but that the meaning of words change over time. For 18th century man, words like “white”, and “race” were used differently from today.”

        Congress indicated its intent as what we would now call white nationalism in 1790:The 1790 Naturalization Act set the new nation’s naturalization procedures. It limited access to U.S. citizenship to white immigrants—in effect, to people from Western Europe—who had resided in the U.S. at least two years and their children under 21 years of age. It also granted citizenship to children born abroad to U.S. citizens.

        If someone looks White, acts White, and fights White then I will consider them of my nation.  Everyone else leaves.  Anything other than this ends in our genocide.  Or theirs.

        There is not much of note in the collected papers of Button Gwinette on race. Apparently he did not ponder it since in his era race was not a topic that surfaced very often. He took the colonial society of America for granted. It was majority white, blacks were slaves who would probably be freed at a future date but returned to their continent of origin which seemed only natural. When a people form a nation from various groups and divisions there are certain qualities which are held in common. Race is generally one of those. It is not to exclude but to unite and from past studies across Asia, Europe and Africa homogeneous people unite far easier that diverse people. The incredible stupidity of forcing a modern worldview upon people of antiquity is annoying.

        Yes and no. The so-called white nationalist argument is a response to the post-1945 idea that America is a creedal or credal nation. One based on an idea, making race and ethnicity redundant. That always was BS.
The other complexity with “whiteness” as America’s founders understood it was that it meant Protestant, too. The Alien and Sedition Acts had an early anti-Catholic element.
Agree tho that the Framers of the Constitution would not have understood the term “White” as it is in the present. Nor is there much point looking to the Eighteenth century to address problems of the Twenty-First.

            Keep non-white foreigners foreign. That is, keep them out.
Immigrant-huggers are operating on the assumption that non-White Latinos will become Americans like them.
The people giving them their orders know that their plan is turn the former United States into a South American banana republic flying a yellow-White flag.

        Most of the clashes between different groups of humans comes down to violence. The problem is, the violence being perpetrated against White people is somewhat amorphous, and mostly cultural in nature, so it is difficult to galvanize White people against it. If White’s as a group cannot be made to to what is being done to us is violence, and if we cannot break free of the guilt this culture inculcated in us from birth, we will simply disappear through diminishing birthrate and intermixed. Rights truly have nothing to do with it, the will to survive is all that matters now.

            It’s not that the violence against Whites as a group is amorphous, it is very real.  It is that a vast majority of Whites do not see themselves as a group.  Making this to be true was a big part of the cultural violence you reference.

        There’s a certain amount of truth to the Woke claim that America’s government, or Western European’s, etc. are “products of institutional white supremacy” or whatever the latest fashionable charge is. As such, it’s quite plausible, and in many cases documented, that minority or outsider populations would be marginalized. In our nation’s history, the Native American and the Negro come to mind.But while those arguments have some ring of truth, they fail completely in the limiting case:What about those cultures that are in fact homogenous, 100% of the same race (Caucasian) or nearly so? Of course, North America never had that, except at local or regional levels and then only for limited times. But Western Europe? For centuries.In those cases, any claim that “white government” only favored whites is laughable on its face: In those times and places where there was a homogenous population, how could it possibly be that the culture, the society, the laws were anything BUT products of the selfsame peoples? And obviously, if there was no out-group, then there was no “minority” to be marginalized, to be discriminated against.What Z says was an 18th century conception of “race” actually lived on until well into the late 19th century at least. Nietzsche writes extensively on social issues in the Europe of his day. He spoke of English, French, Poles, Germans, as distinct races, each with its own cultural (national) traits.

            First, they spent the better part of a century defining white supremacy as the most dastardly evil, so that no living generation had not been so indoctrinated. Only then, and after the GR had made substantial gains, was the founding cast in this accursed light. Whether this was by design or emergent, I couldn’t say. Whether it was all inspired by revulsion of an Austrian artist, I couldn’t say, although that’s definitely part of it. But each step along the way was necessary to get where we are now.The big question is can they maintain this definition of white supremacy as the ultimate evil even after whites become a plurality in AINO rather than a majority (which is going to happen.)The experience of South Africa says yes they can, but more people are “noticing” all the time. I am here, after all. Younger whites are being marginalized in ways that their parents probably have a hard time believing, and they may be the ones, will have to be the ones, who form a white identitarian bloc. Which will not begin from a position of great numerical strength, but that’s the hand that’s been dealt.

                Well put. I’m glad you referenced “plurality” because that, more than “minority,” is the reality. Hence, it would take much more of a buy-in by whites of their intrinsic evil for this to be pulled off.The starting position will not be of great numerical strength, as you also point out, but it will not be with the far weaker hand that appeared likely not so long ago. I now don’t think the Regime can finesse this although it can do horrible damage–even more than thus far–to our people. Whites actually have caught a few lucky breaks in the last few years that increased their noticing and preparation. Our enemies’ alarm is for this reason.

            If you build a house for your family to live in and expect guests to to show respect and deference to you and your family, is that familial supremacy?  I guess in the twisted rotten mind of the Jew it is.  But the Jew has right to every thing under Heaven.  He is God’s chosen.

                The evolutionary strategy of the shapeshifters is different.
We take and hold territory for our familiar progeny, as do most creatures.
The unholy mix, the broken branch, are nomadic gene harvesters.
Their different sub-clades reflect the local building material- whiter, blacker, asian.  One can be religious or not, live in any nation, wear any name; yet at the root, one will always identify first and foremost as a J**.
Slaves.  Slaves will always be the target of these vampires, not land.Land is but a tool.

                    “The Biological Jew” by Eustace Mullins helped me to understand what jews really are.  Parasites, not as a negative connotation, but the biological definition.  There are a number of species of plants and animals that have a sub-species that can interbreed with them yet exists by parasitizing on the main species.
Which also explains why pogroms are actually part of their lifecycle; it’s how they spread their genes to different host societies even as individuals within the original group die en masse.

                Your last point is something evangelicals cannot get through their thick Judeo-Christian heads.  Jews were God’s chosen, but they broke the old covenant, and now deny the new covenant.  You will never hear a Jew say “Judeo-Christian”, because the second word is abhorrent to them.  If they took the new testament seriously, they would understand why Jews are no longer chosen.

                    It is a funny thing.
The Talmud calls Jesus a false profit and sorcerer.
Islam views Jesus as the second greatest prophet, born of the Virgin Mary, and ascended into heaven.
Yet so many Christians have been brainwashed into thinking we’re the Jews’ little brothers.
Not that I love muslims, but at least they don’t have outright contempt for Christianity.
There are many overlapping grounds where Christians and Muslims could/should form transactional partnerships to deal with the (((problem))).

            White/european founded societies are built on safe behavior and an above average IQ.  By definition, only whites and northeast asians have the average ability to contribute to those societies. So yes, i believe we have a white supremacist society.  We’ve tried to privilege and provide handicaps for POCs, but they will never survive or thrive on their own ability.

        Mechanics matter.Societal problems are endless and evolving solutions can be messy, as history shows. Prolonged affluence has robbed us of the raw gauntlets that normally produce strong leaders and thereby lead to optimum remedies; such as was accomplished by our founders. It should now be perfectly clear that we in the West have never been more poorly led that at the present time. As such, disaster awaits, and is a necessary step on the road to redemption.The elites want to create a circumstance in which the bottom of the social pyramid turns on each other in violent acts of mutual annihilation, thereby eliminating alpha males and ensuring the security of their dominance. Both Ukraine and Gaza are current examples of this manufactured evil. They win if we play this game.No matter what you may think is the proper long term goal of societal evolution, you cannot get there without first addressing the seminal issue of pathogens holding ultimate power. You simply cannot fight the foe at your face when some asshole is stabbing you in the back.

        This sort of post is self-defeating, demoralizing and a waste of time.  If we can bring people this way by saying the Founders were white nationalists, it is stupid not to.This thing isn’t a disseration defense, it’s an existential struggle.  Winning through survival and self-determination is the only thing that matters.If we wait until everyone holds correct notions of past, present and future — which no one can hold as Z would rather cat-post than finish his book —  we’ll all be under the ground together, laughed at and lied about for eternity.  But at least we didn’t think Ben Franklin was a white nationalist!2.0 is beginning to look even dumber than 1.0.  At least there was some passion to their foolishness.Men follow fire, not footenotes.

            My objection to your point is that identifying to larger movements will be fruitless. I think we are better served by building tight community bonds of those near us. Any hope of a white identity, in terms of a national group, based on or in opposition to WN is a fruitless endeavor. Build local bonds.

            I agree with your point, but disagree that this is what Z intended.  The audience for this post isn’t the normie, it is those who already understand the nature of the conflict.The sad truth is a vast majority of people either don’t understand that truth or don’t care about it.  Nothing will change this. Der ewige normie.I would disagree with your implication that we should be preaching WN to normies, for the same reasons you say Z shouldn’t be preaching FF historicity.1.  You tell normies what they want to hear so we get influence and power.2.  Follow through on some of those promises so the normies continue to support you.3.  Do the other shit you intended to do all along but couldn’t tell the normies without them freaking out.  e.g., WN.This is the basic formula for changing things in a democracy since democracies were invented.Obama: get elected on “Hope and Change” then stick people with OCare.Trump: get elected on “MAGA” then stick people with… whatever it is he did.Us: get elected on “Real America for Real Americans!” then stick people with “Holocaust 2: This Time It’s for Real”.

        “It is fair to assume that the Framers assumed and expected, therefore would have wanted, the country to look like them in terms of race and religion, long after they were gone.”In other words, it is fair to assume the Framers were retards who couldn’t fathom their new country would be no different than empires of bygone eras.I think it was antidem who pointed out the Founders were idiots for not understanding Plato’s point that democracy not only leads to a dictatorship, but the people will clamor for a dictatorship to save them from their own folly.What did the moronic Founders do? They made it incredibly hard for a dictator (the original Roman definition, which has no negative connotation) to rule America, therefore dooming the US to suffer democracy for longer than it should.So much of political commentary simply boils down to: “they were retards who thought they had found a way to escape the inevitable descend of Order into Chaos”.History will judge the American experiment to be as trashy and ill-conceived as the Roman one. Started with clowns and will end with clowns.

            As always I struggle to speak for “the founders,” but I feel certain that they were constructing a system that they themselves could live with in the there and then, and were not thinking 200 years ahead. Which is probably impossible for anyone, of any era, to do. What happens 200 years hence is a problem for the people of that time.
Rome and the GAE were probably 2 of the 3 greatest empires to ever exist. Calling them trashy and ill conceived strikes me kind of like saying real socialism hasn’t been tried yet.

            If you bothered to study what you speak of, you’d know the Founders did try to take those things into account.  You may have heard it mentioned that we aren’t a democracy, but a republic.  This was explicitly to avoid the problems of a democracy.  President was supposed to be similar to a monarch, Senate to an oligarchy, and House to a democracy.  I think they owed a lot more to Machiavelli than many suspect.The reason the USA fell to shit was all the things we allowed to be changed about that original set-up.  Senate as popularly elected, women voters, darkie voters, utterly ignoring the 10th Amendment, etc. etc.

        The issue that the US was a multicultural country from the onset. A truly homogeneous country doesn’t have a brutal civil war ending with one side subjugating &amp; tribally cleansing the other with forced diversity less than a century after it’s founding.Can’t have a moral consensus with people who are wired differently, White Nationalism fails to address the fact that some Whites are always going to be subversive. People like to point the finger solely at jews but the radical leftists in the north invented what would later be called feminism &amp; practiced a form of christianity would evolve into what we now know as progressivism all on their own. Those people were just as unsalvageable back then as they are now. For every subversive anti White jew there’s an army of Whites who share near identical beliefs even if their underlying motivations are wildly different, the effect on society is the same regardless.Once you start looking at it like that it becomes daunting since the reality is that most Whites alive today fall into that category to one degree or another. Worse yet is the fact they’re all working in unison along with non Whites to make absolutely sure ethnocentric people like us can’t organize politically without paying dearly for it. That won’t last forever though &amp; when they become weak enough that they can’t stop that from happening there needs to be a defined group identity ready to go.Just as non Whites need to be sectioned off because they’re genetically wired to be different so too do subversive Whites. That’s the only way to get a moral consensus but even among people like us that’s a hurdle since there’s an contingent of people obsessed with “one race, the White race” universalism where everyone would be ethnocentric if not for the presence of jews. At this point I think those types of people need to be boiled off as well since they’re only a few degrees removed from those who think non Whites can be reformed. People with utopian views utterly detached from reality, regardless of the specifics, were the origin &amp; fuel of all this madness.Every step of the way to the modern clownworld we exist in now involved radicals pushing extremism &amp; slightly less insane group of people adopting a milder form of those utopian beliefs which inevitably gave way to the former. The only real difference between them is timescale, wait long enough &amp; today’s moderates will become indistinguishable from yesterday’s progressives.Race then acceptance of reality, in that order, should be a hard filter, from there a moral consensus can be made &amp; with that a defined group identity can form. Anyone who pushes utopianism, regardless of the form it takes, should be sectioned off, that needs to be bred out of Europeans the same way savagery was.

            “…the fact that some Whites are always going to be subversive.”
This gave me the interesting thought that when Jamal-in-the-hood accuses a successful black of “acting white” — Jamal is actually accusing the successful black of social subversion, of the same sort as we see from subversive white leftists.

                “Do you really think they came to those subversive thoughts on their own?”Yes, people have agency, Quakers didn’t get mind controlled by jews &amp; modern people gravitate towards ideologies that they instinctively agree with.Its ridiculous that it’s commonly accepted that non Whites are genetically hardwired to have certain political views but Whites are uniquely blank slates subject to outside influence.All of this amounts to absolving Whites of culpability to blame some external force.Take Swedes for example, in Minnesota they’re overwhelmingly leftist &amp; import somalis just like they do in the homeland. Occam’s razor tells me that they’re naturally like that.Even if I accept that some subversive group followed them from Sweden to America constantly flooding them with leftist propaganda what does it say about them that they’re so easily subverted &amp; why should I want to keep a easily subverted group around who have a history of siding against me?These arguments aren’t just about removing responsibility it’s another variant of utopian White saviorism except instead of saving brown people the focus is on saving stupid White people.Your reply amounts to “won’t someone think of the easily subverted Whites?” as if I have some obligation to people who work to ethnically cleanse people like me. You’re free to wring your hands about these people &amp; try to “save” them but I want nothing to do with them or you, to be frank.

            Great post.I’ve spent a lot of thought on exactly what you speak of, and the only thing I can come up with is giving individuals the right to execute on the spot anyone espousing certain beliefs.  I’m sure some innocents will be mistakenly killed, and the would-be racial patriot might have to be punished.  But those negatives are infinitesimal compared to the the negatives avoided.For example, there needs to be a 0th Amendment: “only citizens can have rights including the right to vote and only Whites can be citizens; anyone who publicly argues against this loses their citizenship rights.”  e.g., anyone can cap them.Otherwise there will always be an incentive for elites to bring in more workers to undercut wages and power of those who actually produce.  And it’s the elites who are supposed to punish elites who break the rules…

                It’s regrettable that this wasn’t codified in the constitution from the get go, if there was a defined legal process to do something like this or leave the union for that matter then civil war could’ve been avoided. Even if it wasn’t at least the civil war would’ve been explicitly illegal &amp; the resulting government officially fraudulent.Instead it was decided by biased judges to interpret it however they saw fit &amp; we’ve seen how virtually every single one of those court decisions have played out: it always going in one direction &amp; one direction only.If this was done from the beginning it’s highly likely we wouldn’t be in this situation. This is like the body’s response to getting heartworm, the body raises the temperature so high that either the person or worm dies because if the worm lives death is certain anyway. Apply that to a country &amp; it’s identical.Until we can actually enforce our own laws &amp; morality expulsion will have to suffice unless by some miracle things get lawless enough that we could get away with being our own judge, jury &amp; executioners.Some may think this is extreme but look at what happened. A zero tolerance policy is the only surefire way to prevent subversion.The unfortunate truth is that the founders themselves were the exact type of utopian idealists that should be guarded against. Blood was an afterthought for them, their sole focus was on fantastical ideas that had no basis in reality, it’s why White citizenship wasn’t hardcoded into the constitution &amp; was quickly repealed. What we have today is the fruit of those erroneous utopian beliefs of theirs, if your beliefs can be repeated verbatim to argue for your own people’s extinction then there’s something seriously wrong with them.

So what you describe (separating subversive whites from the rest of us, who will be admittedly smaller in number, at least in the beginning, u til the subversives notice that we have plumbing and electricity that continually works…)…… will require those “aware” among us, to develop multiple, multiple “shit tests” (of varying degrees, Like a teacher starts with basic concepts and then moves on to more complex ones) to verify that the subversives don’t infiltrate easily.

                That’s a great plan, I can’t tell you how many people I’ve encountered who seem to be on the same page but later reveal themselves to be a subversive of some sort. I’m often blindsided by these reveals, having an “official” system to test people would put an end to such unpleasant surprises.It’s always the ones who aren’t consciously subversive that slip past my radar, that’s my own personal flaw of projecting goodwill onto people. I know I’m not alone in having that problem so having some sort of system in place that can weed those types out before they can do damage is going to be a necessity.As you noted there’s going to be a lot of people singing our praises as society begins to fall apart, hell it’s happening now with conservatives getting pushed out of the mainstream into our sphere. As I mentioned before a lot people are unwittingly subversive &amp; I’d argue those are the most dangerous, they’re not consciously trying to destroy pro White movements but that’s the end result. I watched that play out over a decade ago when my local tea party descended into chaotic infighting &amp; eventually dissolution. There was definitely actual glowing agents involved but also quite a few normal people who simply didn’t belong.Honestly the more I think about it the more I think the progression of shit tests is brilliant. That would be both thorough &amp; also not scare off any “unawakened” person who is genuinely on our side but just doesn’t know it yet. I know people who are on the same page as me who would’ve recoiled if they saw the daily stormer right off the bat who later went on to become regular readers of the site as an example. David Cole made the analogy that it’s like scientology, they don’t immediately start talking about xenu aliens, they progressively work up to that. Still it’s safe to assume that most people who wander our way will ultimately be rejected, need to be realistic about that.For now we have the luxury of feeling people out but when things get really bad we’ll have to do what Zorost suggested &amp; have a zero tolerance policy. We’ll need as many people as we can get that are on the same page as us since we’re an extreme minority.

                I responded to you but my comment went into the black hole so just in case it never appears I just wanted to say that series of tests is a brilliant idea &amp; I’m glad you posted it.
I wrote quite a bit more than that in my original comment but that was the gist of it, I’m too lazy to rewrite it again in a way that won’t get moderated, hopefully it’ll show up but in case it doesn’t this will suffice. Thanks for the reply.

                    Secret societies have been doing such shit tests for… well, as long as such societies have existed.  The sign of the cross was originally a ‘shit test’ for Christians to be able to identify each other, for example.  The word ‘shibboleth’ was a password that couldn’t be pronounced by an enemy who didn’t have the ‘sh’ or ‘th’ sound in their alphabet, as another example.Jim of ‘Jim’s Blog’ has developed a shit test for banning subversives on his site.  He claims those collecting a paycheck aren’t allowed to even state the forbidden positions, so all you have to do is ask them to copy/paste something forbidden and many simply won’t do it.  His theory is that it’s because stating the enemy’s position can lead to your own people being converted, although I think it’s more likely it’s due to managerial concerns of going in the wrong direction to any degree.

        Not to sound too autistic, but I disagree that people appeal to the Founders’ intent as some kind of moral authority, but rather as technical experts for the appropriate functioning of this republic they created.
I mean, if you want any machine to function correctly, shouldn’t you reference the operational manual provided by the manufacturers who built said machine?

            Mr. Generic:  I realize it could be merely stylistic, but even capitalizing “The Founders” nowadays implies nobility of thought or action.  They were not atypical of men of their time and class.And if one may assume you are referring to ‘muh democracy’ or even ‘muh republic’ by the ‘machine’ you mention, one might consider the operational manual the constitution.Which, in the opinion of a few of us here, has proven wholly unsuitable and insufficient to safeguard the wellbeing and/or ‘rights’ of White people.In which case, appealing to “The Founders” or “The Constitution” as a moral authority and/or plan for suitable governance reveals one to harbor strong civnat rather than dissident leanings.

                The imperfections of the Constitution do not make those who admire it Grillers. That document functioned exceptionally well for almost two centuries–no mean feat. But it was insufficient to account for declining social capital and the intellectual flaccidity that seems inevitably to accompany extreme prosperity. But those flaws could certainly be ameliorated in a constitution of a future Whiteland. In fact, I would be surprised if the US Constitution doesn’t serve as a model that gets modified.

No it didn’t
The original founders were horrified by Marshal’s power grab in Marbury v Madison.
Then there’s that whole civil war thing a few decades later.
The United States did well for two centuries despite the constitution, not because of it.

                I’d consider the constitution to actually be part of the system that was engineered. I am interested in knowing what it would take to get the most out of that system.
For instance, when Adams mentioned that “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people..”, I’d see that as comparable to my car’s manufacturer telling me for best results to use fully-synthetic oil in the engine. I don’t think I would be a good person for using synthetic, or a bad person from using standard, but that I would expect better results from the synthetic.

                    What Adams was getting at, essentially, is that no system can function well if the people owning and running it are crap.
On the other hand, good people owning and running a system can even make do with crappy systems – the Scandies made a decent run at socialism lite as long as there were only Scandies as part of the system.  Iceland, now that it has it’s first synagogue, is about to find out the hard way.

        “White Nationalism” will never happen and it is pointless to discuss it.  At best, it could be an alliance between different White peoples.  Perhaps the EU and NATO (2 evil institutions) are the biggest expressions of White Nationalism.Problem is, who are White people?  IOW, how many White people in the US think of themselves at an identity level as being White?  What language do “White people” speak?  What denomination do we follow? Other than being attacked for being White, we have no shared identity.Bottom line, White is not an ethnicity, it’s a race. We know we’re being attacked as White, but we do not have the underlying identity to get together as an ethnic group and defend ourselves as a collective the way an ethnic group would. It is a negative identity. I wish it were different. But you can wish in one hand….In order for WN to go anywhere, we would first need a generation raised with a White identity. It needs to be at the core (it’s who we are) and it needs to be positive. I don’t see it happening anytime soon.

            “…how many White people in the US think of themselves at an identity level as being White? “Good one.  However, I postulate more than you imagine.  “The love that dare not speak its name” is not homosexuality, it is *race*—in this case the White race, but also most all races as well.  To this effect, look to where and how White’s live.  Even in those vaunted *diverse* cities we decry, one can walk about from one neighborhood to another and distinctly discern what race congregates therein.  The issue here is not so much that Whites don’t identify as Whites, but they simply refuse to accept/admit that they do!

            Hi Tars –We are being given that identity. Even Ivy League females are remarking that white male graduates are struggling to find jobs while POCs are getting hired immediately. This is no longer affecting the dirts alone.This will go in phass. As cloud and cloud adjacent and even white women are shut out, they will have no choice but to form an identity as white as it was chosen for them. This first phase will be purely self interest and an immediate expression of the survival instinct.You are correct that a deep and positive identity is a vital long term necessity and a long term project. This is, in my opinion, the foremost task of, “dissidents.” We need to do this for ourselves as well as for our youth. School of The West is worth supporting as it is the only one I know of that is focused on western kind. We also need to form societies and associations where we build a living culture and also take time to be edified by our past.We have to look at this as a battle that has been raging while we’ve been asleep. It has been a route because we didn’t show up. We have to show up now, and where the circumstances are not good, we have to do what is needed to turn them around and turn the tide.

This first phase will be purely self interest and an immediate expression of the survival instinct.”I suppose this is why Christians were well known for denouncing Christianity to avoid being thrown into the lion’s den?In general, identity has to be instilled at an early age.  Those White women will never embrace being White as an identity, mostly because you can’t. Identity is not a choice and cannot be chosen like that. No middle aged person is going to change their identity. While an adult can probably become self-consciously White, it won’t be very deep.It is possible that children being raised will, through circumstance start thinking of themselves as White as a part of their identity.  Being a minority at school will do this. i myself have this sense through being a minority in school.  Problem is, this is traumatic.   I cannot even imagine what White kids, even in all White schools, are going through with the school system being overtly anti-White and what damage this is doing to them.  Add in all the LGBTQIPA++ BS and who knows the damage is going to be other than 20% of Gen-Z calling themselves LGBTQIAP++

            Being a punching bag is a pretty powerful identity, and the pummelling of whites has increased in scope and intensity over the last 60 years. In other words, those incessantly demonizing “whiteness,” and “white privilege,” and claiming X is “too white” are creating what they dread most, white identity.That said, it’s a misnomer to think all whites must rally together to create a white identity movement. On the contrary, if a mere 20 percent of whites decide that it’s not only OK to be white, but that it’s OK for whites to work on their own behalf as whites and to hell with anybody who doesn’t like it, then we will be a powerful force. This is entirely feasible.

            There are enough WNs and far more than enough normies who follow along with whoever promises them safety and security to form a White nation.  Vast swathes of North America are still 80+% White, including much of the food-producing regions.

        @Zman, “Was the founding generation of America full of white nationalists?”Easy one. No. Nationalists existed, sure. Hamilton, for example. But the majority of that generation had no interest in a new nation, but rather a federation of states. They had no desire to traveling for days or weeks to a national capital to petition their government for redress of grievances. Not when the alternative was if some damnfool neighbor who harmed you in the name of the “common good” could be dealt with that same day using tar and feathers and a split rail, and you could get right back to minding your own business.

        I don’t think there is any good alternative to WN for Whites in North America.  People of every other race are shamelessly promoting their interests, while Whites are either blind or too afraid. Promoting White interests is WN. And White interests should be promoted and fought for simply because it’s good for Whites. No other justification is necessary.

                Compsci:  I am not the least bit concerned with how White interests ultimately ‘benefit’ non-Whites.  They are not my people.  They hate me and mine.  They would prefer to kill me and take all my ‘stuff’ as well as my history and heritage.
I would prefer that non-Whites not benefit at all from the ‘follow-on effects’ of White rule, because they ought not be permitted to live in White societies.

                    That was not my point (Whites caring, or not caring, etc).  The point was whether or not minorities should be so intent on replacement of Whites as a good thing, or in their self interest.  It obviously is not.  The remark is one based on current mixture, not what we want in an idealized (White) society.

                        You believe they want what you want.  They don’t.  They may very well want a higher standard of living, but they don’t want to live like White people.  Look at the places they come from.  That is what they want. It is a “revealed preference”  They want what they had back home, just at a higher income level.The way I see it, I would much rather live in a poorer version of White America than a richer version of Japan. Income is important, but so is culture. So is it that I live in a community with my fellows who have similar interests, who speak my language and who broadly speaking, think the way I do.  For me, I imagine that living in Japan would be like living in a nice prison with very polite cellies.   As much as I respect Japanese people and culture, I don’t want my daughter laying with one. I don’t want to have  Japanese grandkids. I don’t want to be around their language. I don’t want to be around their aesthetics.  It’s nice place to visit, but I wouldn’t want to live there. It’s not “home”

                        Tara, you make a good point.  I’m operating under the assumption that most non-Whites would like to live in a functioning environment—water, electricity, police protection, minimal corruption.
I still believe some of this is true.  I don’t believe however, that how we (Whites) see such an environment is the same as non-Whites.  I definitely need to think this over given your remarks.

        Perhaps the founders were so based in their whiteness that they didn’t even need this concept to exist, like putting training wheels on Lance Armstrong’s bike.  Imagine them sitting down to dinner and some pickaninny decides to open her yapper and give some political opinion as she serves the soup.   What would they have said?  It just never would have happened.  Racial problems were nipped in the bud.   A time when white men were perfectly sure of themselves.

            The pickaninny wouldn’t have spoken up because she couldn’t have read. And certainly wouldn’t have been able to add anything of value to the conversation while Jefferson and Adams recited Cicero and Tacitus to each other.Also slaves of any era – the white ones in Greece and Rome too – didn’t say anything pointed for fear of being beaten, at best. Though I would bet that our FF didn’t whip Miss Jemima for interceding with an “Aye sho’ don’ know bout nachrul rights Missah Juffason, but aye rekkon one day we gon’ have a Niggra as Vice Pressiden!”They probably just politely chortled.

        “Can it actually meet the challenge and are the trade-offs acceptable to the people adopting it? This is not a question for the dead, but for the white people living in the here and now.”Like most, I fully realize that the label “white nationalist” is clunky at best. And, not surprisingly, Europeans find is bizarre. But we are trying to find a solution to our problem, not the problems facing Germans or English or French.In America, we use the term “white” because it generally works. It works because most American whites generally identify as white though applying their own local culture to the term. It also works because white is how our opponents identity us.As Z noted in his podcast on the Greeks, they didn’t view themselves as Greek. They were Athenians or Spartan or whatever city-state where they lived. But the Persians saw them all as Greek, making no real distinction other then realizing the internal differences among the Greeks might be exploited. So, when the Persians showed up, the various Greek tribes had to pull together and, in essence, become Greeks – one and all.That said, what’s needed is for Americans whites to feel some form of identity, whether they find that in the term “white” or “Southern whites” or “Yankees” or “European” or “Christian whites” or whatever, they just need to find it.It does matter that non-whites just view us all as whites, so, at some point, we’ll need to band together. But I couldn’t care less whether we band together as whites or band together as a coalition of white identity groups. What matters most is that we find an identity to counter the hate being thrown at us and the even more hate that’s coming our way.So, no, the label “white nationalism” isn’t perfect, but it works for now. If something better comes along, we’ll use that. What matters is that whites rediscover an identity rooted in ancestry, culture and history, however broad or specific that may be.

            “It works because most American whites generally identify as white though applying their own local culture to the term”I disagree. While most White people will put themselves into the category of “White” if asked about it, hardly any think of themselves as White in any way similar to how someone might think of themselves as “Italian” or “German”  An Italian might try to keep the language alive and make Italian dishes like grandma used to make. They might even be devoted Catholics and tell stories of the “old country.”  This thinking does not exist in any White people in the US.The problem is we have allowed “American” to mean nothing.  American could have been our ethnicity had we kept hold of it.  Anyone born anywhere can be American.  American can mean anything from speaking English to paying taxes to the US government to protesting.  There are “New Americans” being born all over the world.  From Libya to Mexico to Somalia to China.  They are just saving up for the day they can come and join us in our nothingness and steal whatever they can get away with.

                I disagree. There’s a reason whites overwhelmingly move to white neighborhoods and have white friends. They may not be able to verbalize it, but they are white.Go live overseas. Go live in a black or Hispanic or, even, heavily Asian neighborhood. You’ll very quickly begin to understand that American whites are a distinct people with distinct ways of doing things.We just don’t notice it because it’s always around us, like water to a fish.As to “American,” I agree. It means nothing. American whites still believe that it means them. It doesn’t. They will either learn that lesson or perish.

                    I wouldn’t necessarily disagree that we are a de facto ethnic group. The problem is, without the identity and language to define the “us,” there is no defining “not-us.”  A person who is a de facto White nationalist will never object to a “diverse” person moving in or dating their son or daughter.Another thing that differentiates de facto White Nationalism from a proper ethnic group is it’s just a set of preferences.   These preferences can create de facto White neighborhoods which will be more pleasant for these people on average. But it cannot be defended.  Most progressives live in de facto White nationalist enclaves. Tim Wise famously lives in a zip code without a single “diverse” person living it in.

                        “A person who is a de facto White nationalist will never object to a “diverse” person moving in or dating their son or daughter.”
Man, you’re smoking some heavy stuff today, Tars. A white nationalist would expressly forbid precisely those things because those people are clearly not white. We don’t need your academic definition of white to know it when we see it and to defend it with gusto.

                        @OstalYou misunderstood every word I said.A “de facto White Nationalist” is not a white nationalist at all. It’s just a person who does what a WN would do, but for different reasons.  You know how we joke that progressive are undifferentiated in their nesting and mating habits from the KKK?  That’s what I mean by de facto white nationalist.

                        I believe if you check dictionaries from the 1930’s – 1950’s, part of the definition of an “American” was “Anyone who’s genetic lineage can be traced to the countries of north and western Europe.” I’m paraphrasing but that’s pretty much part of what it said.

                “This thinking does not exist in any White people in the US.”From this and other comments you have made, I would theorize that you are an urbanite bugman who recently became conscious that he is an urbanite bugman.  Congratulations on your Ascendance, I hope you continue learning and growing.However, your experience is not the norm in America.  There are a fair number who identify as White, and a large number that don’t want anything to do with non-Whites.“The survey included 3,038 non-Hispanic white respondents. Among these respondents, only a minority expressed high values on any of the above questions: about 28% expressed strong feelings of white identity; about 38% expressed strong feelings of white solidarity; and about 27% felt that whites suffer a meaningful amount of discrimination in American life… It is worth noting that a 2017 Washington Post-ABC News poll estimated that about 10% of respondents supported the Alt-Right.”https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-demography-of-the-alt-right

            In the early days of America, Whites thought the distinctions between the Anglos, the Germans, and the Dutch were more significant than the American Indians, who just saw them as White.
The Indians saw themselves as Iroquois, Sioux and Comanche.  Whites also noted their tribes, but also saw them generally as Indians in a way the Indians didn’t see themselves, until I suppose, the Whites became a bigger threat.
It’s important to know how your opponent views you.  We are attacked as Whites, therefore we must band together to defend ourselves as Whites.

                I’ve always felt that I gained a unique perspective (somewhat) growing up a fair number of American Indians around. You see with your own eyes that it can all be taken away.
Granted, in my wildest dreams, I didn’t think that it would happen to us. But I always saw immigration through the eyes of an American Indian.

            Europeans baffled by (or pretending to be baffled by, or socialized/propagandized to say that they’re baffled by) “white” is a recent phenomenon. Americans arrived here from Europe with an already established concept of whiteness and, when relevant, wrote it into law—without explanation. It was always a broad, meta-ethnic category. Contrary to the lies of Ignatiev et al., the category has significantly *narrowed* over time. The first Portuguese explorers of Japan described the people they found there as white, and they meant the same thing we’d mean if we said it today (if we said it in unironically): They’re us.

            I doubt they still do, but in decades past, academic historians taught classes called Western Civilization I and Western Civilization II. Although politeness forbade anybody from saying so, these classes could just as easily have been called White Civilization I and White Civilization II.The people who comprised and created this discrete and unique civilization were almost all genetically Indo-European, and they all had comparatively pale complexions. And the historicans didn’t just conjure something ex nihilo; they gave intellectual form to a civilization that actually existed. Whether you lived in Nova Scotia in 1902, Queensland in 1802, Finland in 1702, Galicia in 502, Moesia in 102 or Corinth in 402 BC, you belonged to the same civilization–white civilization.

                Western Civilization in olden times really meant north western European civilization, with a head nod to Spain and Renaissance Italy.  Basically the Hajnal line with the souther half as an appendix.
Greece and other orthodox christian areas were definitely out. Points further east – fuggedabodit.
Which means maybe 30% of caucasians were part of Western Civilization.  Except for the Irish – most considered them barely better than negros.

        Whatever mental contortions White nationalist come up with does not matter a bit so long as Jews control the media and the educational systems.  It really is that simple.  Jews showed up on boats from eastern Europe.  They immediately went to work in an organized way to seize the social high grounds.  Now you have generations of Whites brought up on false principles.  Even if they could magically be brought to our cause we are now outnumbered by POC.  The White race got out-played.

            We most certainly did. But we are where we are – and we are in a very bad spot.
It’s going to be a long fight back. The good news is that Jews are slowly (quickly, even) extinguishing themselves in the states via mixing with whites and low birth rates. They also, stupidly, imported competitors.
Just a guess, but I suspect that the Jewish grip on power is loosening. Regardless, we can’t rely on others failing so that we might win.
It’s a long road back.

                Jewish power has probably already peaked. In hindsight, the day Iraq was invaded was probably the zenith. But that doesn’t mean the immediate dropoff is precipitous. In 10-20 years I expect the difference will be a lot more noticeable. It’s noticeable now to any non-stupid person who is paying attention. Most of their support is among older people who won’t be around much longer.

                    Jeffrey Zoar:  Those ‘old people’ are also, unfortunately, the largest cohort of Whites in AINO.  As they die off, the starkness of our demographic plight will be far more visible to far more people – most of whom are our enemies.Being a persecuted minority can leave one with paranoia and/or rage.  It is not generally conducive to good mental health.  Consider those White children suffering in majority non-White schools.  Not merely physical suffering at the hands of joggers or mestizos, but mental suffering from the arrogance and insularity of the east and south Asians.Yes, curse their parents, but we must find a way to give White youth hope and a positive identity and pride and will to survive and thrive – separate and distinct from all the rest.

                    Yep. I’d say that Jews really grabbed full control of all the commanding heights ~2000. Sure, they were gaining control for a long time before that, but there were still some of the old guard around until around that point.It’s amazing what a mess of things that they’ve made in just 20 to 25 years. They really are bad at running the show. As I’ve joked, not surprisingly, the con man doesn’t make a great CEO.There’s no doubt that among the younger generations, especially kids in their 20s, Jews aren’t as much of a force. They’re still there, don’t get me wrong. And among them, they’re still pretty arrogant and play as a team. But they’re numbers just aren’t there. They’re also not as hungry, in part because they’ve been on top for so long and in part because most of them aren’t that Jewish genetically so have lost some of crazy genes.Because of my kids, I’ve been on a few college campuses, including one top college. Jews are few and far between. Still a good amount of whites. Lots of Asians and Indians with a few mystery meat types and a sprinkling of blacks and Hispanics who look white.Young Jews are facing a dramatically different world. A lot more whites are at least race aware. The Asians and Indians have no time or love for Jews. They won’t willingly put up with Jewish power or guilt trips. If they have to, they’ll keep their mouth shut and say, “Yes, sir” to Jewish power, but you can bet that they’ll be working hard to form their own power bases. They know how the game is played.I don’t know how the whites will react. Will they just swap out their Jewish overlords for Asian or Indian or will they join the power base game now that it’s out in the open? I don’t know.But I do know that Jews don’t know what coming. They just assume that they’ll be able to play the same games with Asians and Indians as they do with whites. Not going to happen.

                I don’t think it’s as long as some might think.  We already have enough Whites who are pro-White, just none in any positions of power due to the jew control.

        Yes, early American leaders would have never comprehend why we should want to flood our country with other races then teach them to hate us. But here we are.The real problem is that we have a hostile tribe with significant power in running the country. I doubt the founders could have invisioned:1. That hostile tribe setting the moral guidelines most whites, including most Christian religious leaders, follow.2. The role of women in the culture and politics especially given how easy they are brainwashed and how much they want to appeal to the powerful.All white nationalism, talk 9f secession, acceleration and whatnot is just political masterbation unless those 2 things are dealt with.

            The problem with your statement is neither of those things can be dealt with until we are in power…
What is needed is for us to get in power or at least be influential locally, then state, then region.  Do what each of our abilities allows in our area.  We shouldn’t openly espouse WNism, just common-sense things that dog-whistle WN.

        No need to go back into antiquity and the mists of time for “original intent” from dusty old documents written by white men.Debating the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, Ted Kennedy (“Lion of the Senate”, notoriously bad dater) said this:“Our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually…..the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset.”This wasn’t considered controversial at the time, it was considered basic common sense.No matter how explicitly laws are written or sold, it’s all pointless if our ruling elites ignore the letter and the spirit of the laws they pass.TINVOWOOT

                In two little words, cheap labor, and further the ability to undermine the working class’ solidarity when they were under serious challenge, and in disregard of their genuine contributions to the health and safety of the Republic.
Viewed historically, that was the vision of the genuine driving wheels of the Republican party at its inception, Yankee supremacists as they all were, and aspired to be in perpetuity.

        Agreed that it’s self-serving to interpret the past anachronistically.In Federalist 2, John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and later Governor of New York, wrote, “Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people — a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs…”Which, as pointed out, isn’t and couldn’t’ve been an endorsement of current strains of white nationalism.The  main conundrum has to do with assimilated Jews. Their racial antecedents are primarily white European but many would deny them membership in a white America on non-racial grounds. The same with meti Indians. Who’s in and who’s out is always ad hoc in time and place.

            imbroglio:  You are being dishonest and deliberately confusing the lines between race, genetic ancestry, and ethnicity.  While meti Indians may be called Aryans, no White of European ancestry would consider them part of his race.  And Jews, whether superficially ‘assimilated’ or not, have also never been considered a native part of what was White, Western Christendom, from which heritage America was born.

        It’s a weird thing. One side basically fetishizes whiteness, the other side anathematizes it. I think it’s because neither has a white identity. You don’t think about this stuff if you have it. Of course you want to provide for your descendants. Duh. That’s natural and good.
Maybe it’s a reach, but I often get the sense of whites parroting the arguments of non-whites, so to speak. This is how out group people talk about the in group— either critical, or wanting to be part. Idk.
Generally, I see it as another symptom of whites’ alienation from themselves.

        “Our modern idea of “white”, meaning broadly European, would have seemed strange to Thomas Jefferson.”Modern white nationalism is a US phenomenon, and Europeans can still not quite fathom it — they have Irish nationalism, Scottish nationalism, French nationalism, Greek nationalism and so on, which for over a century have been largely defined as in opposition to other European nationalisms. The concept of a common European ethnicity still sits uncomfortably there. This held even in the USA, where many of the 19th and 20th century European immigrants to the USA were not held as equal to those already here — this applied to people from Germany, Ireland and later from Italy, Poland, Hungary and Greece. The white nationalism of today is possible only because of the deluge of non-white migration to the USA, largely after 1965.One of the reasons why the founders could not have conceived of large-scale non-white migration to US shores was that the world was a less crowded place back then. India had maybe 200m (?) people back then, China maybe around the same, Britain around 15m and so on. Right now more and more of the world is becoming uninhabitable for many of the people there, and hence the inexorable urge to migrate to where the grass is greener.

One of life’s sad ironies is that White medicine, technology, and food production is a primary reason these places have become so crowded.
It’s interesting to consider what would happen to Africa if Whites withdrew their support. The population explosion would reverse itself rather quickly due to disease, starvation, violence, and the occasional bouts of cannibalization. But hey, it’s Whitey keeping them down.

That is true. A family might have six or seven children and have two reach adulthood. The infant mortality decreased because of Western medicine (vaccinations and other health practices). Likewise for food production.

                “…occasional bouts of cannibalization.”There are occasional bouts of cannibalism now.  If food stopped being imported, it would be a combination of “Night of the Living Dead” and “Quest for Fire.”“The two Ugandan-backed movements routinely enslave pygmies to forage for forest food and prospect for minerals, a UN official said.Hunters returning empty-handed were killed and eaten.”“Much of the vast forested area is controlled by the Mayi-Mayi, a loose grouping of tribal militias united by their magical beliefs and taste for human flesh.On a recent assignment in eastern Congo the Guardian correspondent saw many Mayi-Mayi fighters wearing parts of the bodies of their Rwandan enemies, in the belief that this would make them invincible.”https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/09/congo.jamesastill

            I’m too lazy to look up the numbers but wasn’t another “issue” that whites were the biggest group by far at that point in time.  This was really a mindset that went well into the modern age, that white people were the only game in town, even though it stopped being true over time.  In other words, the founders wouldn’t have considered other groups because there were no other groups to consider.This thinking can be witnessed in real time in a place like China where they view their ascendance as inevitable and that losing some Han is no biggie as “there’s so many of us, we’ve always been here, and will make more!”, even though a glance at the population tables show this view to be a little bit optimistic, to put it mildly.

I think in the year 1900, one person in three was of European descent. Whereas today it’s probably one in twelve (or even more). The populations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have exploded. White populations in North America and Europe increasingly feel under siege. And this at a time when their own economies are under stress and they are facing declining living standards year in, year out.

            If they’re living in parts of the world that are uninhabitable it’s because they made them that way. If they want the grass to be greener let them plant seed. Our job is not to take every even brown person from around the world and put them on unemployment and give a hotel room.

            Also hence the depop agenda, but you can’t say it, because Hitler!Let’s be honest: eugenics has been a Germanic thing. Not exclusively, but influential in the US, UK, and Germany until some big wars sorted it out. Now we pay the price for our sin of preferring quality over quantity, good and hard.Is it evil? I think abortion is an abomination, but I have mixed feelings about contraception, tbh. Good breeding? That’s all royalty and nobility did forever. What’s wrong with it, provided you take care not to become inbred? I’m glad my family was also at least a little picky about who they married lol.I’m thinking of EMJ saying WASPs took themselves out of the game by not reproducing. He’s right, then again, living closer to nature might’ve prevented the flood and prevented WASP fertility drying up. Idk.I mean, you keep everybody alive, and you end up creating a situation where you’re wondering if you have to cull them. That’s pretty dumb imo!

Contraception is an abomination, but not because it leads to good breeding.  In fact, the opposite.  It disassociates act from consequence and purpose, leading to promiscuity and elevation of passion over reason and discipline.  Even if it never “fails”, those who use it show a lack of discipline / control, and that lack will get passed on.

        Can’t say it any better than this:“It will probably be asked, Why not retain and incorporate the blacks into the state, and thus save the expence of supplying, by importation of white settlers, the vacancies they will leave?Deep rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries they have sustained; new provocations; the real distinctions which nature has made; and many other circumstances, will divide us into parties, and produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of the one or the other race.–To these objections, which are political, may be added others, which are physical and moral. The first difference which strikes us is that of colour. Whether the black of the negro resides in the reticular membrane between the skin and scarf-skin, or in the scarf-skin itself; whether it proceeds from the colour of the blood, the colour of the bile, or from that of some other secretion, the difference is fixed in nature, and is as real as if its seat and cause were better known to us. And is this difference of no importance? Is it not the foundation of a greater or less share of beauty in the two races? Are not the fine mixtures of red and white, the expressions of every passion by greater or less suffusions of colour in the one, preferable to that eternal monotony, which reigns in the countenances, that immoveable veil of black which covers all the emotions of the other race? Add to these, flowing hair, a more elegant symmetry of form, their own judgment in favour of the whites, declared by their preference of them, as uniformly as is the preference of the Oranootan for the black women over those of his own species. The circumstance of superior beauty, is thought worthy attention in the propagation of our horses, dogs, and other domestic animals; why not in that of man?Besides those of colour, figure, and hair, there are other physical distinctions proving a difference of race. They have less hair on the face and body. They secrete less by the kidnies, and more by the glands of the skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odour. This greater degree of transpiration renders them more tolerant of heat, and less so of cold, than the whites. Perhaps too a difference of structure in the pulmonary apparatus, which a late ingenious* experimentalist has discovered to be the principal regulator of animal heat, may have disabled them from extricating, in the act of inspiration, so much of that fluid from the outer air, or obliged them in expiration, to part with more of it. They seem to require less sleep.A black, after hard labour through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the morning. They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome. But this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present. When present, they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness than the whites. They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in labour. An animal whose body is at rest, and who does not reflect, must be disposed to sleep of course. Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me, that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid; and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous.… I advance it therefore as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind. It is not against experience to suppose, that different species of the same genus, or varieties of the same species, may possess different qualifications.…When freed, he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture.”Thomas Jefferson, “Notes on the State of Virginia,” Query XIV

Jann Wenner said basically the same thing recently, and of course got canceled for it. As much as an old has been like Wenner who isn’t doing much anymore can be canceled. But nobody even tried to refute him. They no doubt thought the refutation was self evident, in light of all the hugely successful rap “artists.”

        I think this is overcomplicating things. Did the FF ever imagine opening up America to the whole world? Obviously not. But then neither did George III ever envision an English minority London. What we are doing today is so insane that it would never have occurred to them.
I disagree that men can’t be moral authorities. I think that’s how people often decide morality, whether or not that’s a good idea. But “daddy’s always right” seems to be built into the brain code. Whether or not that is “true morality” is a long, deep and probably endless discussion.

I remember visiting Hoxton in 1996 and being surprised at the “diversity” but having been born and raised in south London I was used to non-whites being a small minority.

                    I rode the London Underground (tube) in ‘68.  At a stop strolled in a Black man in full British suit with bowler hat and the typical gentleman’s umbrella.  Odd thing was, this man was facially scarified.  Yep, tribal scarification all over his face and it showed.  Would have loved to hear his story, but I got off at the next stop.  I chalked it off to the legacy of colonial Britain in Africa.

        It always pisses me off when leftards in particular foist the current thinking and morality on those of the past.  They thought the way they did and acted the way they did because that’s just the way it was.  It wasn’t necessarily better or worse than today, just a different time and place.  But the tards will always say it was far worse because it was the evil White man just being his natural raciss self for excluding the noble black, red, yellow and bean man as part of our “Posterity”.  I suspect at some point in the not-too-distant future, the tards will rue the day they championed our replacement, but then again, being tards, maybe not…

The disingenuousness of the left is personified in the “WWII soldiers were Antifa” meme, like the average soldier wouldn’t have defected and fought with the Germans if they caught a glimpse of modern existence.

Sobran’s famous quote goes here.  Other than slaves, it probably never occurred to the Founders to import non-whites, much less gift them with citizenship and voting rights.  They knew where they stood in relation to the rest of the world and did not have decades of public school education to not believe what their own eyes told them.

        The word racism didn’t even exist until coined by Magnus Hirschfeld of Die Institut für Sexuellewissenschaft (the Institute for Sexual Research) in Berlin, in the late 1920s. Asking the Framers to think about race in terms we in the modern world understand it would basically be asking them to time travel. Go back and you’ll see references in the past to America being a place of multiple races, by which they meant the Polish “race” and German “race” and French “race.” This made some sense as, again, these men couldn’t look into their crystal ball and see NGOs sending boats filled with unibrowed rapists from the Levant, or guys who speak by clicking their tongues eager to knock over old women for their purses in the park.Ditto for modern concepts of slavery. Most of the founders had little problem with it for the same reason they had no problem with Republicanism or philosophy: these were ideas inherited by the Greeks, from whom they (and the rest of the Western world) took their cues. Take a look in the eyes of your average greeter at Walmart and tell me we still don’t have slaves. Or, as the kid in “Idiocracy” said (“Welcome to Costco. I love you.”) Slaves at least got to party on the weekend and sing and cut loose; they didn’t have diversity training and urinalyses.Our main problem is having forgotten something those “Dead White Men” and most real men—even nonwestern ones like Khan or Tamerlane— throughout history understood. Who is right or wrong is determined by who is who wins in battle. That’s really as deep as morality goes. You have what rights you can physically defend. The reason Michael Anton doesn’t want you to know that is that he can’t fight. Do you fell your enemy with your sword? They you are a good man. Did he slay you? Then you are bad. Arguments, contra what Ben Shapiro thinks, don’t win you anything but arguments, and not even that when you’re arguing with a crazy person.I’m not saying we do the Moldbug / Vox reactionary thing and fantasize about being lords with fiefdoms and start painting Warhammer figurines as we await Trump’s ascension to the throne. But the next time you see some prog’s Subaru in traffic, pay attention to the bumper. There’s usually a sticker that says: “War doesn’t determine who’s right. It determines who’s left.” It’s there to let us know supposedly how wrong war is. But you should start looking at it as a mantra for our side, as we prepare for whatever comes. Building a “wall” is no solution to a problem, unless you’re willing (and able) to pour hot oil on the man who would attempt to climb said-wall. The men manning our (mostly nonexistent) wall, can’t even handle the reins of their own horses without being accused of being whip crackers. We have to deal with the weak liars who run everything—who’ve enslaved us to this morality—before we can begin to doing anything of substance. Because right now we’re very much slaves. And not the happy ones making music with their corn jugs.

            ” You have what rights you can physically defend.”This is the bottom line. For example, we know Abbott and DeSantis are not serious men because they have not developed weapons of mass destruction and the willingness to use them (they are frauds for many other reasons but this is relevant to the immediate point). Mao ultimately was correct. “Rights” are the pretense that there are things more relevant than raw power. Andrew Jackson was correct. “Law” simply is state force and the willingness and ability to use it.For a very limited time a homogenous people with shared beliefs mostly did not have to resort to force to live together. Their descendants now are on the receiving end of state violence because they came to believe the propaganda that camouflaged the only thing that mattered, which was that ability to deliver pain and certain death.

            I discovered this to my dismay just recently when I tried to run off a couple Recent Arrivals To our Shores from trespassing onto my neighbors property while she was at work. “we are just looking for work senor”. “no comprende senor”. I stood my ground and spoke firmly, repeatedly telling them to leave and that they had no business to be there. They lingered around the edges of the property for almost an hour, apparently hoping I would tire and go away since they obviously had no place else to go, but I was persistent, THEN an hour later I caught them at it again, this time after I routed them, they drove slowly away while I followed them in my vehicle. They slowly drove around the neighborhood up and down residential street, while I called 911 and tried to report what they were doing. The 911 operator declined to dispatch anyone as there was no immediate threat. Once I returned home and told my family and the neighbor, everyone was appalled, actually appalled and frightened for me saying that I was in the wrong and could have been arrested myself for stalking or harassing THEM. And this is why this country is in the sad situation it finds itself in today.

Yes. Indeed: your first mistake, I’m afraid to say. Whilst confronting these people is commendable, especially if you can vouch for your neighbour, involving The System is a backward step.
Of course, if your neighbour happens to have BLM signs in the yard, then perhaps offering assistance is something reconsider…

                    Yes. Normalcy bias compels particularly our peoples, steeped in rich histories of law and justice, to trust a system that no longer exists. The differences with cargo cultists are minimal. There are ways to handle such situations but they predate the written rules that once bound us.

        The WN argument WRT the FF is not difficult to grasp and for the most part valid, despite the term WN not existing at the time.  WN was the default state of every euro descended polity at the time, just as Christian was the default religion. Wokester swarthy winges are irrelevant to the issue.The WN appeal to authority is generally an appeal to tradition and white self interest, from what I see.  The FF are part of this but not the sole component.  I am not quite sure why Z keeps riding this hobby horse.  Sure, when examined in detail, the “FF were WN” claim is a bit more complex, but it is still largely valid on its own merits and fair rhetoric.Oh, well.  It wouldnt be dissident-ish politics if  someone was not splitting hairs on something barely relevant and making hay over it.

            WN use the FF words to try to convince Normies to join the cause. It’s not a bad idea, but if Normie hasn’t figured things out yet, I doubt some words from Jefferson are going to get him over the hump.Personally, I don’t care what the FF said. Sure, it’s nice that they agree with me, but if they hadn’t, I wouldn’t say, “Oh well, Jefferson said that he loved blacks and didn’t like distinguishing between the races, so I guess that I’ll give up viewing myself as a part of the American European people.”We solve the problems of our time and place with what works for us.

            Well said. I haven’t read Greg Johnson’s manifesto but I probably should. I am familiar with Jared Taylor’s arguments. My takeaway from his argument is that he does invoke the Posterity, first immigration act as a part of his argument. He makes two other arguments that ultimately I find far more persuasive.1. We face an existential threat and that we have a sacred duty to our ancestors and our posterity to preserve our race. Our race is beautiful and wonderful in its creations and it is ours. It is here because of the sacrifices of our ancestors to preserve and develop it. If we love our civilization we must preserve our race because only our race will create our civilization.2. Racial diversity in every historical instance leads to tension and conflict – more than in a homogenous society.The latter two are far more persuasive. They are persuasive because of the vitriolic anti-white rhetoric that is constantly pouring from all of our institutions as well as the decisively anti-white policies they enact and carry out. After a few years of this, you look at Jared Taylor’s arguments and you realize that he is just giving word to the argument that the avowed enemies of the white race are making for us.We face a serious issue and we must be up to the task or we are finished. I think Guillame Faye said best that our fetid elites do not realize the fate that awaits them if they do not wake up. Once the jackals are done feeding on us, they will turn toward the balconies of who threw us to them and show no mercy.I discovered this recently. I had no idea Obama was pals with this vicious, genocidal sadist. That his peace prize has not been rescinded and that he lives in comfort in our nation’s capital in supporting this is a very grave development.https://youtu.be/QFcbncHyk30?t=1055

                “you look at Jared Taylor’s arguments and you realize that he is just giving word to the argument that the avowed enemies of the white race are making for us.”
Poorly said. I meant to say that Jared Taylor is merely formulating the proper reasoning and response to the argument that the avowed enemies of the white race are making for us. They are calling for our subjugation and ultimately our annihilation.

                A fine summary RR.  I’d like to add an argument for those who don’t feel a duty towards their ancestors or posterity:
Non-whites see you as white and many feel hostility towards you because of that.  There is nothing that you can do to alter that.
A group will always beat an individual over time.
Therefore, if you want to save your skin, you must join your tribe.
Whites, whether liberal or conservative, who tried to be allies to non-whites are finding that this maneuver only buys them a temporary reprieve.

                    Your response reminds me of the videos I’ve seen of ex convicts describing their first days in prison.  Regardless of race, the prison gangs (based on racial divisions) recruited them easily.  The choice was made apparent quickly—tribe up or die.

        “Like the anti-whites who claim original sin as justification for their present behavior, the white nationalists pointing to the Framers are looking for a moral authority.”It has not been my experience that WNs who point out the racial themes in the work of the Founders are doing so because these believe in the moral authority of the Founders.  Rather, they are trying to persuade social conservatives that a racial understanding of the world is not immoral because the Founders did it too.(A similar and fun experience for me was showing an older conservative who deified Lincoln as the OG anti-racist that Lincoln wanted to deport the blacks.  He was dumbfounded and speechless.)

            It is not immoral because these are people who are treated as moral authorities, or thought to be treated as moral authorities, held these ideas. White nationalists would nothing to say about the Framers if they did not think referring to them added moral heft to their arguments. As you say, the people doing this think it works on civic nationalists. I think this is a mistake and has the opposite effect. It is like telling a Muslim that Mohamed actually liked Jews.

                Yeah, that time is long past where CivNats could allow themselves Old America’s great men. Of course, they never understood them anyway. Dwight Eisenhower had a portrait of Robert E. Lee in the White House and deployed the 101st to Little Rock at the same time.

                I wish I wasn’t as pessimistic as you, but yeah when I saw the regime tearing down the Civil War reconciliation monument the other day I had the thought that anyone who still believes in this pig-system at this point is a hopeless cause.
I mean, going through the motions is okay, as it’s not like we live in a free society, but actually acting like the “motions” mean something is…delusional.

        John Jay meant exactly what he said in 1787-“…Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people–a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and independence.”

        I remember reading that some sociologists argue that there is something called the American civil religion. Basically it’s a concept that certain civil artifacts like the constitution and declaration of Independence are treated almost like sacred texts, and the founders are also treated with a certain degree of reverence. In the absence of a firm belief in God as the final authority we often fill the void with historical figures and their documents.The anti-Whites and the White nationalists are both appealing to a human centered locus of authority. It’s gotten to the point that a Western political movement that deliberately puts God at the center as the final moral authority would be the most radical in the present context.

            Centering God as the moral authority solves nothing because most living Christians believe that making decisions based on race is forbidden by God.
If Christians who have believe in a muscular, historic Christianity can persuade today’s Christians of their views then I will be impressed.

                I think some Christians think this, but I am not sure it is a majority much less most. I think the bigger issue is that Christianity has been supplanted by civic nationalism for most white people as the moral framework of their politics. They have been conditioned to leave God out of their politics and in many cases, out of their lives altogether.I am sympathetic to the plight of Christians, but I do not think an explicitly Christian political message is going to much better this time than when it was tried in the 70’s and 80’s. Instead, it needs to be a political movement that is accepting of Christians and willing to defend them on political and racial grounds. The term “white Christians” should be common with white advocates for this reason.

                    I’ve said it many times. Our salvation almost certainly runs through combining race and religion – and I’m not religious.
From what I’ve seen, of the whites who have awoken, the Christians are the only with the most fight and willingness to organize and take the punishment doled out by the usual suspects.
We’re fighting a religion. It’s hard to win if you don’t have a religion of your own.

                I remember Hunter Wallace posting something at his blog awhile back about a white Christian couple in which the wife was artificially inseminated by a poor African. This was supposedly the height of altruism, carrying this impoverished foreigner’s baby to term. Reading that I felt like Ripley in “Aliens” when she stumbled on the queen’s nest of eggs. It’s seriously sick, some convergence between figurative cuckoldry and something more literal. The Orthodox and some of the emergent Christian nationalists seem untainted and compatible with what we’re trying to do. The rest—especially the prolife for everyone contingent—just want to protect the queen’s eggs and worship the alien. That’s worse than a suicide cult, as the suicide cult just wants to kill themselves, not you, too.

                    The Orthodox are the way they are simply because they’re a smaller sect (except for parts of Eastern Europe and Russia) and therefore haven’t been targeted by Globohomo, and also tend to take pride in their Byzantine aesthetic. I’m not so sure the Orthodox are naturally based though, and are vulnerable to the same disease that the RCs have.The Greek Orthodox Church is the largest Orthodox church in the West, and as a result has been bitten by the neoliberal bug. (Just bitten, not overtaken like the RCs; but there will be more bites…) Bishop Elpidophorus, for example, has made conciliatory gestures towards gay marriage.The Orthodox Church higher-ups seem to be rather above politics, as an organization. From my reckoning, they do not want to get involved with the issues of the day and prefer to just worship Christ without worldly distraction. This is probably an old reflex borne from years being under seige or in hostile environments…the Orthodox heartland was conquered by Muslims and steppe peoples for endless centuries. But they survived mostly intact, to their credit.But will they survive neoliberalism, the ultimate conqueror?

                “Centering God as the moral authority solves nothing because most living Christians believe that making decisions based on race is forbidden by God.”More generally, it solves nothing because most living Christians simply do not accept the spiritual importance of This One Life (i.e., one long trial, a learning experience). Many just seem to lack Faith, outright. You try to speak to one of them about the afterlife, about loving Christ, about self-sacrifice and the nature of Evil; you’ll get a blank stare.A man must first have Faith in Christ. Then he must do his utmost to not sin and repent like there’s no tomorrow. Quite frankly, I have found Christianity a tremendous spiritual boon to my own life, and I look forward to His final judgement, when He wishes it to come.What Z says below (of many Christians) is also very true:“They have been conditioned to leave God out of their politics and in many cases, out of their lives altogether.”Christ is always in my mind and heart. And when asked by people, I’ll tell them so.

                    After the onset of the Industrial Revolution, God was replaced, not simply forgotten.  He was replaced by Science (yes, I agree, man—not another god).  The point is that material wealth was confused with spiritual health.  But all is not lost as we are now seeing Science as the “god that failed” and there is a position open.  We shall see who/what replaces Science.

Indeed.  Saw a license plate on a fancy Mercedes that read “blessed”.  Guess they all forgot about that rich man, eye of a needle thing.

                        That’s why I’m making a pitch for the real, literal science of religion, or religion as a science.
No more of this running around, mewling and groveling and trusting.The young want the truth, truth one can hold, truth one can feel.
(None of that wuvvy-dovey “transend!” biz, either.  Too girly.)
