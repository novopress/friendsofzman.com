        These past weeks have taught me that every American who said stay out of European affairs was correct. That continent is a cesspool of intrigue and perfidy…and a large degree of perversion and feminization. I come from their stock, but I am not of their stock. They might as well be white Persians to me.

            You can’t really blame them. Europe is really a collection of a bunch of different microstates with shifting needs and alliances. Europe also has its pluses. I don’t have the right words for it, but the people have a little bit more of a softer touch. I don’t know if it’s more family-oriented or how to describe it. We live more in our little silos here in the USA.Also, when I was in the Netherlands, I was thinking to myself, “this place isn’t bad.” If this is what paying high taxes gets you, I might change my opinion on that subject.

                I dunno, I was taught at a young age that there were “Britons” and “Continentals”, and they were pretty different…Britons had a “code” and were less prone to despots, and tended to keep to themselves rather than get whooped up into mass movements, and most importantly, didn’t have serfs or peasants in the European sense. Britons were “sober” and believed in the value of the individual while Continentals…were not and did not.White Americans, for their part, and depending on where you live, are mainly the offspring of 17th-century Britons. And we haven’t changed that much while our cousins have now embraced Woke Juche, which is depressing. I can see Germany doing that, but not my Britain.

                            Evil is not omnipotent, tho it can seem that way in this world.
That is why the ‘brother wars’ are being fought in heaven and upon Earth.
If evil were omnipotent, there would be no brother-wars, because there would be no resistance.

All we can do is try to fight It.

                Being of Dutch heritage, you are not off.  However, the high taxes you associate are really not that high when you think of it.  Two points: One, there is basically one taxing agent—the Fed’s—if you will.  Everyone in the USA needs to look at their total bill including State, County and Local (city) taxes to get a true comparison of taxation.  Two, health cost are included.  That is no small number in the United States.  For example, my costs—as a retiree—is about $16k per year for wife and I.  We’re old, and so the cost is definitely justified—and recently, we’ve (unfortunately) used every nickel of it I’m sure.Of course there are many things in the Netherlands’ social system I find repugnant, but an attack from a cost perspective is far down the list.  Whether such remains in themilieuof “diversity” remains to be seen.

                    I’ve been going on about health care for years. We’ve been getting scammed. I know that makes me a heretic on the right, but once you see it you can’t unsee it as they say.

                        Tars, once again you head straight to the point—empire!  It has been said that “unbridled capitalism” would soon be selling human flesh in the meat market.  And so it is.  We’ve made empire part and parcel of our capitalist economic system while calling all other systems the dreaded “S“ word—socialism.We picked up where the British left off.  They used force and colonization, we use dollars but have little aversion to force if required.  That’s probably why we’ve teamed up so well after WWII.If you talk to a Dutchmen, you’ll not find the abhorrence to their tax rate as they feel they are getting something for their taxes—not the least of which is peace of mind.  I know few people—if any—who do not fear their economic status in this country, and that’s in the upper middle class.  God help the multitudes who are scrambling like rats through a maze seeking survival.

                    Look at this video and the happy people in the crowd. I don’t see happy folks out in the streets here in the USA even at a concert event or doing anything else. I actually don’t see this a lot in people’s private lives. Everything here seems so stilted, so artificial.That’s what I’m talking about when I talk about the European soul. They seem so much more at peace and at ease than the average American and you also sense that in everyday interraction.“André Rieu &amp; Heino performing ‘Rosamunde’ (known in the USA as the ‘Beer Barrel Polka’) live in his hometown Maastricht.”https://youtu.be/uOE0ISnLXR4

                        Yep, I remember my father and I watching his concerts on TV. At that time I was kind of confused seeing so many happy people. Concerts seem different here. More aggressive, if anything.  Of course, Rieu appeals to an older crowd.

                If this is what paying high taxes gets you, I might change my opinion on that subject.
This is what not running an empire gets you.Plus, what were the demographics of the Low Lands at that time?

                If I lived in California, my state income tax bracket would be 11.3% and my federal income bracket would be (is) 35%.
46% percent total, and that’s before every other piddly tax (roughly 7% sales tax, gas tax, you can’t build anything tax, etc).
My point:  California is what you get with high taxes in the US. There’s no recreating the Netherlands here even with 100% taxes.
The Netherlands is cool, but they’ve embraced the values of the GAE, and it’s ruining them.

                    But that’s my point. Even in the places where we pay high taxes here, most of it is a dump. At least they’re getting something out of their high taxes, not to mention what Compsci said about it including healthcare instead of fighting wars for a short comedian.

                    The GAE principally offers or coerces feminism and its accoutrements: homosexual celebrationism, open borders, mall culture (MA-terialism), and liberal-totalitarianism throughout its institutions of law, government, education, media, corporations, and captured churches.In truth the GAE is a RELIGION that, awash with signaled virtue, we force down the throats of the world’s nations . . . for that is what I described above.Therefore the problem — and the solution — largely is in our own houses and homes, for that is where the individuals of the GAE are raised. How many of our households in the past 50 years have refused the influence of feminism on their children? Very, very few. Hundreds-of-millions, instead, have embraced the gynarchy.One cannot collude with the GAE for decades, and then pretend horror when it is shipped by the empire to other nations. I mean, does the CIA do anything except force other countries to accept feminism and progressiveness?  That IS Our Democracy.

                        This is it exactly, very well stated.  It took me a while to see this, that is, to see that when globohomo foments and orchestrates one of its “color revolutions” somewhere, they really mean the associated language about all the “our democracy” and feminism and LGHDTVWXYZ+++ sickness.  For the longest time I interpreted all this as pseudo-moralizing smoke, to cover resource-grab motivations and get the shitlib woketards on board with the usual warmonger crowd to form a majority “home front” coalition in favor of the warmongering.It is more recently that I noticed that when they seek to impose feminism and butt sex on some target country for a color revolution, at least some of them at the top, at the very top levels, are truly motivated by this, not resources, or grit for neocons and weapons contractors, etc.  For me, it was a somewhat difficult thing to get my head around.  The thing is, as always, now that I’ve seen it I can’t unsee it.Some say wars are always about resources.  However, history suggests at least one exception — some wars are about religion.  With this in mind, for those at the top levels of the Globohomo Empire not motivated by resources, this only leaves religion.  This psychopathic/sociopathic poison of theirs founded in the darkest and ugliest flavors of soul-stuff is formally religion to them, in the full-on and true sense of the word religion.  I can imagine their pledge of allegiance goes something like this:I plead allegiance to the Globohomo EmpireAnd to the Dystopia for which it standsOne Bug Pod, under MolochWith feminism and butt sex for all!

                Socialism, in the form of the welfare state, worked well in Europe for many decades b/c the populations were–were–ethnically homogeneous. It has never worked in “our” country b/c we have never had that homogeneity, which has necessarily bred resentment.

                    Agreed. It’s easier to look out for your brother in a homogeneous society. Plus, Northern Europeans don’t have that grifter mentality. Traditionally, they are proud people and don’t want more out of the system than what they put into it. That’s why I have long thought the Northern European Protestant ethos is superior to most of the rest of the world. I’m not saying they were perfect, but they did the most things right.

                    A welfare state only works if there is a high fertility rate pushing large numbers of tax paying young people into the workforce. That isn’t happening anywhere in Europe even with mass immigration. In addition, as the population ages and there are more and more dossers, there are more people taking out of the system than paying in. When the UK pension scheme was introduced in the early 20th century, the life expectancy for men was 49. You got the pension at 65 and had a few years of rest before popping your clogs. Today, people can live 25 years after retiring and draw their pensions for all that time. There’s no way any state can support that for long. But hey, why should our scummy unelected EU leaders have to deal with that kind of problem when they have to save democracy from the new Hitler?

Most the the hare brained stuff coming out of Europe isn’t possible without our massive security subsidies.  And, in turn, how much of that insanity winds up in the US if the Europeans aren’t always pushing it?
Green energy?Universal healthcare?Demographic replacement?
Those are the luxury goods of countries that don’t have to worry about getting invaded.

                A lot of the people are the best you will ever meet.But in the last 20 years (starting with 9-11) what once was real leaders who couldn’t avoid toeing the USA-dictated line on a few matters of importance for the USA was replaced by ********s who would live jumping at every order coming from The USA (from the new, far more controlling, USA rulers…) after asking “how high?”.None of these people wanted conflict with Russia, or any relations with Ukraine, however they raced to show as much obedience as they could when the anti-Russia directions came from across the Atlantic, and now they can’t openly switch around just because the USA’s policy turns about; it’s about their pride, and posturing as if they were something they aren’t.

                There is and should be no such thing as Europe other than a landmass.  The EU is the most evil institution on the planet.  They use the common currency, totally unnecessary in the year 2000, let alone today, to control the various countries and the free movement of people to destroy every locality in the EU.
When the individual nations rise and tear up this evil institution, I hope they treat all the former EU bureacrats like the communist-fascists they are.
I pray to Saints Antoine Louis and Tobias Schmidt.  May their names come alive again!!!

                Americans think that every problem on earth was caused by someone else, and it’s our job to fix it. I know a dozen men in their 40s and 50s whose lives have been messes (like mine, but I’m not kidding myself) who still smirk and laugh at countries like Russia because they walk around smug in the belief that we could “end them!” at any time if they don’t shape up and emulate our example.Ourexample? What can one say.The disconnect between reality and what’s in people’s heads has never been clearer to me than over the past 72 hours. You literally cannot get most Americans to look at a map or actual statistics from this war. They are still living in Disneyland, where wishes (“We’re America! People want to be like us! Free!”) have long replaced reality. Even those who want out of the war still think Putin will have to make concessions to the US in order to do so, and that Trump will dictate the peace, not Putin.

                    The depth of the propaganda in the US is amazing. Even our host’s palDerbyshiresaid last week in his podcast that was posted here that Russia was “a corrupt and very overstretched empire”. I couldn’t help but find that supremely ironic given thatweare the ultimate “corrupt and very overstretched empire” template the world has ever known. I suppose he may well be aware of this too but it illustrates the extent to which even critics of our empire default to “Fox News” rhetoric.Even now, Grillerland continues to live in a construct made up of various historical snapshots – a house of cards made up of Polaroids taken at times of American glory, there’s one of the flag raising on Iwo Jima, another of people dancing on the ruins of the Berlin Wall, and of course a whole bunch taken of burning Iraqi tanks in the desert. Even today it doesn’t seem to bother anyone that there really aren’t any from the last 30 years, at least none you would want people to see.

                        I saw a “news” short on YT right after Zelensky took a huge shit in Trump’s coffee that showed a bunch of dumb Eurosluts out there in France and the UK holding signs saying things like “support Ukraine”, “Death to Putin”, and of course “No War!”. It’s typical womyn-think. Say a bunch of stupid evil shit and then chant a nice virtue signalling slogan and that makes it all acceptable and resolves all the obvious contradictions. Supporting Ukraine in this context of course doesn’t mean “no war” but “more war”. Of course womyn are just the worst offenders and make the most obvious case for limiting the franchise but the Grillercon men of this country are sleepwalking towards WWIII as well.Democracy: explaining the Fermi Paradox for 10 billion years.

                    Perfect comment, Arthur.I still hear people saying that the path to peace is for Putin to withdraw from all of Ukraine (including Crimea) and pay compensation.Well sure, and the path to happiness is to marry Scarlet Johansson and live on the Moon but it’s not going to happen, is it?When we say that normies think history is something that happened from 1938-1945, this means in part failing to understand that our side can lose.Did CNN do this to people?One day the war will end and Joe Normie will insist until his dying breath that plucky Ukraine was just about to sweep into Moscow when that traitor Trump rug pulled them.Let him be; save your arguments for those worthy of them.

                Hogwash.  Americans know full well this was caused by our own neo-cons and crooks like the Bidens, but the Euros were just fine with keeping the show going, even after America has pushed the neo-cons and Bidens out of power.
Now, real Americans are trying to shut the thing down, and the Euros are still screeching for us to do the fighting for them.

I’d like to point out that I share neither a common religion, common history, common ethnicity,  nor a common culture with those people.  The fact that some of them have managed to weasel their way into our geographic region does not promote them to being part of any collective “we” I’m obliged to respect.
I have infinitely more in common with any Russian than these fellow whites and I will not feel obliged to answer for their nefarious deeds.

            The best European men of two successive generations were killed off for no good reason whatsoever, and then the continent was put into vassalage. Yes, it is no surprise that we have the leaders we have today. It is no surprise the place is run by wimps and girlbosses today and it plays out exactly as you would expect. But the only way to fix it is to let them sink and let the real leaders rise to the top. Of course the system is fighting that tooth and nail, most notably in Germany.

                We English lost about 1.2 million in those 2 wars.I think the Frogs lost about 3 million in the first and bailed early in the second.The Germans probably lost at least 7 million in the 2.That was a huge number of their best and brightest. No surprise that they are such cucks now.

                    The “frogs” had 600k killed—civilians and military—in WWII, but remember the shortness of the armed conflict.  They were beaten up badly in 6 weeks and were (mentally) in no position for a protracted conflict—especially in a war started by their ally, Britain.  No offense meant to the French.  They deserved a better political class.

                        The only thing that saved the Brits (relative to the French) was they had a channel to flee across. Thus, the “surrender monkey” scorn heaped on the French ever since doesn’t seem exactly fair.

                            No it doesn’t.  And due precisely to the general ignorance of our population and the performance of our schools, the typical American does not know that the French saved the British asses as they fled Dunkirk—sustaining most of their losses there (e.g., 40k French troops fought to the last man at Lille).Even in the movie “Dunkirk” the British could not toss a bone to the French.  Watch the movie again and tell me where you saw the French there or of their defending critical towns outside the beach.  But a big deal was made of several towns where the British were told to fight to the last man. Yes, 100k+ French were also evacuated, and that’s to the good, but the movie badly downplayed the French role in the fiasco that was to be Dunkirk.Disclaimer:  I’m not French.  Don’t particularly like them.

                        Also–and more important–France’s losses of life and the physical devastation of a huge swath of the country were a HUGE factor in France’s defeat in 1940. Also, Belgium’s failure to complete their portion of the Maginot Line made the invasion of France considerably less complicated, not to say easy.

                        ChatGPT to the answer:”Yes, various European nations have historically used derogatory terms for Italians, often based on stereotypes or historical conflicts. Some of these terms are outdated and offensive, but they have been used in different contexts:France:RitalOriginally used for Italian immigrants in the early 20th century, now sometimes used affectionately but can still be offensive.Germany:Spaghettifresser(spaghetti eaters) A derogatory term implying Italians are only associated with pasta.Switzerland:TschinggA Swiss German term used historically for Italian immigrants, now considered offensive.United Kingdom:WopUsed historically (borrowed from the U.S.), derived from without papers (though this origin is debated).Spain:Macarroni. A slang term mocking Italians, derived from “macaroni”Austria:ItakerA derogatory term for Italians, still occasionally used today.Many of these terms emerged during waves of Italian migration in the 19th and 20th centuries and areless commonly used today, though some persist in certain regions.”

                    The French army sufferedaround 6 million casualties, including 1.4 million dead and 4.2 million wounded- which is why they sat out wwII
Germany’s casualties in World War I included2,037,000 military deaths and 700,000 civilian deaths
Germany’s World War II casualties included 5.3 million military deaths and 6,600,000–8,800,000 total civilian and military deaths.
Britian was a major instigator of both conflicts and lost by far the least people.

France was wide open to the German invasion in 1940 b/c the Belgians never finished their portion of the Maginot Line, as the French had done. I don’t think “sat out” is quite the right description, although I know what you mean and don’t disagree.

                    It’s not just the raw numbers, as horrifying as it is. The aristocratic class of these countries, especially in World War I, were totally wiped out. So it was the people who were groomed from birth to take over the nation and the ones who felt a duty to fight alongside the commoners, or even in more dangerous situations. Of course it’s totally different now, you have situations like Netanyahu trying to trigger a world war while his son lives a life of luxury under state protection in Miami.

                ‘Killed off’ is right.  Those wars were arranged and financed by multi-national corporations that funded BOTH ‘sides’ of the carnage.  What an evil scam.
Britain and the Continent exited the Great Wars with a huge deficit of alpha-manhood, and empowered females and wimps rapidly filled the void, ruling with incompetence and arrogance.  You see it everywhere in U.S. and British politics, but most obviously in Europe.

                This is the whole point. The money is just a side hustle. They want a third European civil war, this time with nukes, to wipe out our race once and for all. They figure the global south will survive, sort of.It took me a long time to understand this. I didn’t want to, it’s so monstrous. But it’s the only conclusion that makes any sense of the contradictions of our falsified history.The good news is that the narrative structure that supports this horrorshow is collapsing, albeit slowly. The political structure, unfortunately, is still strongly in place, but there are some cracks in the foundation.But it will not fall until we can talk honestly about “them”. We are not there yet.

            “I come from their stock, but I am not of their stock.”This is true, America siphoned off Europeans who did not want to live the way they did for a variety of reasons which were mostly good as far as people like us are concerned. That plus prisoners of war &amp; kidnapped children who were forced into indentured servitude which wasn’t ideal.For a time, after we became an established country, half the Euros who came here ended up getting filtered &amp; went back home. We had a very strong selection pressure against incompatible demographics before we completely reversed that &amp; geared society to become a dysgenic supremacist paradise.I always have a good chuckle when dissident Euros blame us for their condition, up until fairly recently our culture has been hyper traditional relative to the degenerate culture they’ve loved to indulge in. Its still common for the non rightist among them to insult Americans for being bible thumping gun toting homophobic racists. Every single time I vacationed in a foreign country the trashiest Whites I saw were always without fail from some Western European country.

                        Had one run in with Chinese on a road trip to Montana.Spent the night in some motel along the route.  Outside was a large bus from some sightseeing service based in San Francisco.  We spent the night and in the morning we attempted to partake of the complementary breakfast from the motel.The smallish breakfast area was in shambles and packed with those Chinese nationals from the bus.  There was literally nothing left except a bit of coffee.  We waited a bit for new egg’s and stuff to be placed, but as soon as a tray was placed in the sever basin, it was emptied.  As near as I could tell, emptied by tables and tables of Chinese that had already cleaned out the first serving. 🙁Now they could have been American Chinese except that there was a tour guide who seemed to translate everything into Chinese and direct the whole s**tshow, so I assume these were nationals.  I think the wife and I left with a roll and some coffee rather than wait out the insatiable mass of Chinese tourists.Really was somewhat like that scene in “Yellowstone” where Cosner has to drive off a bus load of Chinese tourists from his land with a rifle.  Where was Cosner when you need him:https://youtu.be/LOrkILQmpRk?si=tyTdyyTI_602Hqka

                    20 years ago, traveling in exotic locales, Germans were considered the worst. Super cheap, and acted like they owned the place.

                    “everyone knows this”Perhaps everyone else has a different definition of trashy than myself.I consider men wearing thongs, women ripping their tops off in public, particularly in front of kids, sexually groping hotel staff as well as engaging in lewd behavior generally &amp; being obnoxiously loud at restaurants to be trashy behavior. Can’t say I saw any eastern euros behaving that way but I sure saw a lot of French, Brits, Dutch &amp; German tourists engaging in such behavior.Perhaps the Caribbean &amp; Latin American countries, which are the places I’ve been to besides Canada where the French Canadians were similarly disgusting, are exceptional. That you can speak for everyone else who had a different experience doesn’t speak for mine nor does it make what I saw &amp; my opinion of it vanish from memory.

                    It really is odd but observable that Britons are scrupulously polite AT HOME but are really ill-mannered when abroad. Not ALL Britons, of course, by any stretch of the imagination, but there is a reason for the multitude of press reports about British hooliganism abroad (esp. in France) especially after soccer matches. The lower classes drunk and away from home.

                        The overwhelming feature of British tourists I met was them being insufferable whiners.
They travel to the desert and complain its too dry, to the beach and it’s too wet. To the rainforest it’s too green, and would the wildlife stop blocking the view?
Americans were almost always the total opposite.

                    Russians tend to mob a location and get feisty…either drunk, or loud, strip down to their hairy bodies more than they should, and their women walk around like tarts and act all haughty. They also tend to smell.As for Brits, they insist on eating THEIR food, then get piss-drunk and start fights with locals. Brits also like to board planes with all their stupid soccer scarves and sing their stupid sportsball songs; believe a person who has been on RyanAir numerous times. If you think Phila. Eagles fans are the worst, then ANY British soccer fans are 100 times worse.Americans and Chinese are not nearly as offensive.

        For we (late) Boomers, the European attitude is mind-boggling. Like many grads of my era (mid 80s), I backpacked pre-euro Europe with my Berlitz phrase books and strong dollars. The level of hostility to NATO/US among my age peers was truly shocking. This same age group is now running Europe. So am I to believe this generation suddenly loves NATO? It’s all fugazy. This is all about maintaining the raison d’etre of the European Union – entrenching the political class and crushing local, popular dissent.

            I’m so old I can remember when the media and political class in Europe wanted America out (at least publicly). No Pershing missiles, no US military. Today, the same class has been itching for the American Empire to start WWIII with a nuclear power right on Europe’s doorstep since at least 2014. Just as when Obama slouched towards DC in 2008 the entire anti war movement vanished overnight, the whole posture of a peaceful Europe was always a fiction. Peace was never the objective, merely a convenient merkin to hide other machinations. A different merkin will do just as well when needed.

                This has amazed me as well and I can only make sense of it by observing that these baby-killing pedophile communists of the West were sympathetic to Russia when it was the heart of the Soviet dystopia stomping on the face of humanity for what they hoped was forever. When Russia turned into just a run of the mill semi-czarist hybrid parliamentary state they suddenly become rabidly hostile to Russia braying for blood and waving freedom flags that they were proudly burning the year before. These people are the enemies of humanity.

                Is it a merkin or a strap-on? I guess it doesn’t matter at this point. That said, I can’t fathom what these “other machinations” are. The status quo pre-Maidan was working for everyone in Europe, if not American Neocons. This is honestly the most baffling geopolitical development of my lifetime.

                Perhaps this is proof that the human race is essentially insane, as we have a generation that for 50 years has forced a vision of itself as a peace-making, kind, progressive, tolerant group of 80 million (and been taken at their word) that now wants dozens of nuclear missiles flying across the sky tomorrow for a line on a map.
Maybe they were that way all along and we failed to notice. Shame on us for not picking up the signs. But maybe we’re just as bad.

                    They were that way all along.  These self-styled “liberals” have always been vicious fucks.
And yes, human nature is tenuous at best.  Most people are stupid and even the best are at least a little “insane” or conflicted.  Comes with the territory of life.

            Project Ukraine is different things to different people. Here at home it was sold as the Eeeevil Putler suddenly going crazy, one day – and invading the Kraine for gits and shiggles. Selling the project to the Euros was much easier. They are closer to The Beast, most have living relatives that remember the old Soviet days. Few people Over Her don’t understand that Stalin killed more people than Hitler ever did. Uncle Joe seldom gets credit for it, but he killed more jews too. There’s feuds that go back decades and bad blood that goes back centuries. The further east you go in Europe, the easier it is to sell the project.To Euro grillers and normies – Putin going into the Kraine was a replay of Hitler going into Poland. That is why Germany just shrugged when Biden blew up their Nordstream pipeline.They actually do have minor cause to be perturbed about the US abandoning them and The Project – but at the end of the day, if they themselves are largely to blame for their circumstances, as are we over here.

                Since Lord Palmerston (1853) and the Crimean war, and Mackinder’s World Island (1904) and Churchill’s Great Game, your Glorious Sovereign’s game has been to blockade Russia to keep it from getting too strong. That British anti-Russian sentiment goes back even earlier, actually, to when Tsaress Catherine sided with America in 1812, or to when Russian warships patrolled New York Harbor to keep British ships out during our Civil War. Don’t you northern barbarians still celebrate a “We burnt the White House” holiday up there?

                        Yes, Stalin took back the control of Russia from the Jews, but saying so would reveal that communism was largely a Jewish project (both in USA and Europe+Russia). Hence we get “Stalin is a bigger killer than Hitler” stories.

                    Looking at the War to Save Stalin from both east AND west, Japan and Germany, as well as in Spain previously, I contend that our Socialist Diktator FDR’s mission was not only to create a bureacratic apparatchik soviet in the US with the New Deal, but that the Cold War fought by our newly created CIA was toextendcommunism, not to “contain” it. We did so by sabotage, feigned incompetence, within western-leaning countries, while keeping the USSR in business. Thus, no Cuban liberation, just Contras, and no valid predictions either.

                Yes it looks that way. But it so bad for business. I realize not everything is about money. But this narrative alone doesn’t fit the actual facts. The Russkies were happily buying up (Brits happily selling at high prices) London and Gerhard Schroeder was on the fricking board of Gazprom 3 years ago. All upper classes in Finland and Estonia were making money with Russians. Who threw the switch and why?

        There should be a digital clock hosted somewhere showing in real time the accumulated deaths of Ukranians. Photos and videos uploaded daily would help also. You never know though, the souless mind controlled orks everywhere would be unmoved. Their own social status is far more important.Damn them all.

                Agreed. Up here in Alberta we have a large Ukranian demographic. They are ticked right off at the west and the USA in particular for not supporting the war they started. I like Russians, and I like Ukes… but my response to that is “go fight your own damned war…”

        Z makes a good point about the managerial class – both here and in Europe – not wanting to focus on the mundane job of actually running a country. Infrastructure, energy policy, worker training, etc. The managerial class finds such topics incredibly boring, in part because they have no actual skills so they know nothing about these issues and in part because they consider them beneath them.Instead, they always spend their time topics that make them the hero in a great fight. Project Ukraine fits the bill. So did BLM. Climate change works very well. Freedom is at stake! The world will melt if fail! Black people will be slaves if don’t defeat evil white people!These people hate normal life and use these issues to escape themselves, which is why they’ll never quit and why Trump has to kick them to the curb.

            Part of that problem is we’re now on the third post WWII generation.  The first designed and built the global system–they knew it intimately and had the advantage of experiencing Armageddon up close and personal.  The second generation was well educated and mentored enough to know how to pull the levers and make the machine work, but couldn’t make design changes.  The third, on the other hand has largely grown up in an inbred DC bubble.  And like malevolent Eloi hasn’t a clue how to build it or run it .  So they simply carry out the old rituals, like a Cargo Cult, hoping “John Frum” will bring the planes full of goodies again.

            That’s because the only people who seem to care about the mundane job of running a nation are White males (ok, and East Asian males too). They’re the ones who do all the actual work. Just look at any municipal government or city utility and see who is doing the real work. See what a basketcase that non-White or non-male bureaucracies are when they touch actual services, like the DC metro or the Los Angeles Fire Department. Everyone else is either in it for the grift or to push a bizarre ideological vision of society without doing any real work. This is something that Solzhenitsyn discusses a lot in his forbidden book, the Russian authorities tried to get a certain tribe to do agricultural work and they simply refused and undermined it at every turn. They don’t want to do it and they can’t do it. We are still living with this mindset today, but it’s not just them. It’s everybody.So you have a system where for 50 years, everybodybutWhite males have been pushed to the top of the heap and the results are playing out exactly as one would expect.

                ‘That’s because the only people who seem to care about the mundane job of running a nation are White males’Yup.  Therefore lo! came forth the Ebil Ebil White Male, Necessary Scapegoat, target of the GAE for fifty years running . . . especially in America, the heart of the beast.The gynocracy and its allies marshalled all their power to demean, disenfranchise, deconstruct and destroy the Ebil Ebil Ones and their civilization.  To thwart and reduce their power everywhere in society, from the courts to the cribs.This, they largely have accomplished.  Our streets, clotted with thrown-away men, speak the truth.  But the Grrls and their allies haven’t a clue how actually to build, maintain, or improve anything. Except their own bank accounts and victim-empowerment.

Once this clown show is done, they’ll move on to the next one… Once the prostitute walks out or is blown out of the office, another whore will walk in our lives demanding attention and gimmes. Fuck, I turned into an old man today, spiritually I’ve always been.. but still..guess that’s why I have this melancholy vibe, no one will pay for the crimes, no one will learn anything and we’ll move on till the next thing.

        Vladimir (eff that fake and ghey spelling to differentiate him from the ‘other’ Vladimir for clueless Normies) Zelensky is an enemy of the United States, and a co-conspirator of the internal enemies of the United States. To wit, my personal opinions:1. He was part of the Maiden coup, in cahoots with the likes of Clinton, Nudelman, Vindemann, a Rogue’s Gallery if there ever was one.2. He was part of the ‘phone call hoax’ fake impeachment, again in cahoots with Vindemann.3. He is a frontman for parties in hiding.4. An ugly, physical dwarf and strutter, Mr. Magazine cover – seems to think he is some Pale of Settlement Che Guevara.5. Has laundered untold sums as his wife saunters around spending in public.6. Has aided the internal enemies of the United States to launder untold sums.7. Gynocrats whine he was ‘bulled’ … a man that is supposedly leading a nation, a warlord, and can’t handle himself with two grown men without swearing in his native language like an angry falafal street vendor that you tell gave you too little change.8. He is a dictator that cancelled their precious ‘Our Democracy’ no less than their boogeyman and his Enabling Act of 1933.9. Arrogant, irritating example of his kind of despot, but still an odd lightweight.9. He is a war criminal with the blood of his countrymen on his hands. He wants OUR children’s blood.10. He is a personal enemy of President Trump, grandstanding to embarrass and undermine him, with no intent on making peace.

                Can’t say I have seen too many mentions of the fact that both Russian leaders in this conflict have the same names. “The Two Vladadmirs” — IMO the approach is to avoid mention. Link/citation otherwise appreciated.

                Ukrainian is, as far as I can tell, a made-up language. Someone with an inexplicable hatred of Russia made tiny little changes to their native language out of spite just to be able to show Russia that the Ukraine isn’t Russia. A vowel or consonant change in a word will never change the fact that they are Russian in spite of their retarded Ukrainian supremacy garbage. It’s not a country, it’s just a place for miserable misfits.

        i don’t see zelensky being alive much longer, he has behaved atrociously in office, and presided over (and encouraged) gruesome war crimes.  and of course he is guaranteed to sell out everyone he can, on his way down.  plus killing him now unblocks peace talks, quickly.

                Yep. Zelensky has proven to be a total loose cannon. He knows way too much about US and European involvement in this mess and the massive graft. He’s also addicted to fame – amongst other things – so he’ll do anything to stay in the limelight.
That’s not the kind of guy you want walking around after he leaves office.

                Exited a brief exceptional slump and returned to recent average, apparently. But numbers we’re shown are all bullshit, so who knows. We do know that some peoplereally enjoythe idea of dumb MAGA guys being driven, cheering, into a meatgrinder by Jews. Keep a list of those people, maybe.Recruiting still heavily favors everyone but normal white guys—the military isthecore of Our Diversity*—so Trump fan enthusiasm (if present) isn’t particularly important. And I haven’t seen any.I’ve seen military family men say that the children they pressed into service are relieved that the election went the way it did. This is the conservative equivalent of a “dindu nuffin” soundbite. Every good boy is still going to fire into the crowd.*which actually preceded Our Democracy into the pantheon of Who We Are.

        Zelensky is the key here, as his very life probably depends on this war never ending, at least not until he has an exit strategy. He cannot make a deal with the Russians because the ultra-nationalist will not tolerate it. The only deal he could make is one that requires Russia to surrender, which is not a possibility. His other choice is fleeing the country, but he would no doubt be tracked down by enemies. That leaves him with no other choice but to keep the war going.Another poor innocent jewish victim of goyish manipulations. Will these people ever get a break? They just want the best for us!

        “The reality of Europe is bleak, largely due to the perfidy of the Europeans political class.”Indeed so. Rickets and tuberculosis are making a comeback in Britain and one reads of old-age pensioners dying of hypothermia because they can’t afford sky-high heating costs. And yet Third-Tier Keir offers unstinting support for the ongoing Ukraine fiasco, as does that weasel Macron. For years they could posture as “world leaders”, with a nod and a wink from Team Biden, on account of being such loyal compradors, henchmen, and sidekicks. But Team Trump now wants to retrench the failing empire and these little worms have no idea of what to do with themselves. Govern their European countries? They haven’t the foggiest idea of how to do that. They only know how to be quislings.

        All solid points, Zman, but I believe you err by characterizing Ukraine as just another managerial program.  Just as “our greatest ally’ is not just another foreign country.  Ukraine was more than just another case of meddling and grift by the neocons and managerialists.  It became a moral crusade on behalf of a certain tribe’s ‘people.’  And it soon morphed into a crusade to crystallize these self-proclaimed prophets’ definition of “America’s soul.”  Which is why we got all the ‘that’s not who we are” and the inevitable Putin/Trump/Hitler comparisons.  Allreaching a crescendo into the ultimate battle for ‘our sacred democracy.’  The opposition may not have any ‘cards,’ but they have money and spite and hatred to spare, as well as convoluted and historical disinformation and financial networks.  They will not simply go away quietly, and they will not consider themselves ‘beaten’ so easily.

            Putin too has taken this as an opportunity to make antifascism the official religion of Russia. And to him too, fascists are us—people like us, not people like…
I can’t think of any fascists. I’m sure there’s like five of them out there somewhere, perfecting the syndicalist case for antisemitism in early 20th century Salzburg.
“Everyone will be Hitler for fifteen minutes,” we used to joke. Turns out we’ll all be Hitler forever. He’ll be the reason for every nation’s domestic repression, the cynosure ofeverypost-war consensus—which will always be: The people must be stopped. They’re nazis!

            I suspect the only reason for this administration’s lack of enthusiasm for the Ukraine War is that they are running into an industrial capacity problem, oops.

        I was talking to a Ukrainian friend about this the other day. They are thoroughly disgusted by the midget in fatigues.
Another (((foreign interloper))) sent by our greatest ally to destroy the indigenous population, while getting rich too.
He’ll be lucky to escape with his life at this point. Best outcome for the tiny tinpot dictator is a beachfront condo in Tel Aviv.

            This is one of those times that one must wonder whether this is purely a PR stunt, or if Starmer and company really are so deluded, so far into the Star Wars meme view of the war, that they really believe they can do this. I don’t discount the prevalence of the “we will win because ‘free democracies’ always win” view among his set. Which is why I haven’t confidently written it off as a PR stunt.

                Column A/Column B. The thinking may be a war pulls the attention off how bad a PM Starmer is and the fact Muzzies are running around Old Blighty going “stabby-stabby”. That and the fact England is turning into Airstrip One from1984punishing Thought Crime.
They haven’t thought any of this through nor thought of the potential for retaliation from Russia since it’s been so long since their homes were in the crosshairs (or targeting coordinates as it were).

As we used to taunt kids on the playground: “Oh yeah, you and what army?”
I’ve been reading the Royal Army can’t even pull together 200 tanks, and they have less than 100 Self Propelled Guns for artillery support. When the BEF got kicked off the European continent in 1940 they pulled around 400K men from Dunkirk.
Do the Brits even have 400K men in their entire Army?

                He only needs a few Brits.  The goal is not to have them fight, but to have them attacked by Russia so the US has to join in.  Trump should give them a heads up that NATO is inoperable should this occur.

        It seems to me central to note that most of the people pushing hardest for this war and defining “American” self-interest as war with Russia are Jewish: Victoria Nuland, Robert Kagan, the Vindmans, Adam Schiff, Anthony Blinken, Bill Kristol, Rachel Maddow, Masha Gessen, Max Boot, Annie Applebaum, Michail Khodorkovsky, David Frum, Garry Kasparov, Bill Browder, Ihor Kolomoysky, Anne Applebaum, Wendy Sherman, Avril Haines, Samantha Vinograd, Chuck Schumer, Janet Yellen, Jamie Raskin, Jeff Zientz, Sergey Brinn, Thomas Friedman, David Goldman, Edward Luttwak, Noah Rothman, Robert Zubrin, Allen Weinstein, Carl Gershman, Jeff Zucker, Jonathan Chait, Larry Fink, Len Blavatnik … the list goes on and on. And of course Zelenskyy himself. As they so often do, they mistake themselves for the true definition of America and Americans, and mistake their interests and desires for America’s interests.

        The positive in all this is the Overton window moving to normalize a US exit from NATO. An alliance which ceased doing anything positive for us decades ago (if it ever really did). Some establishment figures are now saying it openly.

        Force Zelensky out, jam your puppet in, end the war.I see on Breitbart that the usual suspects — instantly that aging crustacean Darryl Hannah — is backing Ukraine ‘independence’.She and her spiritual kin do so because Project Ukraine involved a lot more than laundering cash for U.S. and European ‘elites’, and feeding the U.S. MIC and Beltway parasites.Darryl cares because America’s underlying reason for regime change was to establish our feminist-socialist-globalist paradigm on the front porch of Russia.  This, they call Our Democracy, and they wish it to metastasize to every corner of the globe.Russia’s backing of the Christian Church and capitalism makes them the Great Enemy.  They are the Establishment that the Sixties radicals — in charge since the Clinton Administration — revolted against and successfully overthrew.This is the spiritual war taking place inside the headlines.

I wish Amy Klobuchar and Chris Murphy’d move to Ukraine and run for office there, since that nation’s interests seem so paramount to them.
I’m excited to see what shivs Trump will bring to the Joint Session speech tomorrow.  The enemy media will have to air the speech after Zelensky self-immolation.

        I, too, have doubts that the TV administration can undo the post-Cold War mindset that has infected the collective West: that it’s always 1938 somewhere and that someone is always Hitler. There’s just too much money and graft still to be had and that gravy train needs to be constantly fed.  BTW, what’s the current count of Hitlers that “our democracy” has vanquished since the end of the CW?  I count at least six (Milosavich, Saddam, Osama, Gaddafi, Assad, Raisi).  Still lots out there: Putin, Xi Jingping, Rocket Man, and of course Trump, who they certainly tried to vanquish many times.  And will again.Might be a good topic for a show – “Our Democracy and the Many Hitlers”.

        I think Trump should announce he will not negotiate with Zelensky because he canceled elections, and therefore is not a legitimate leader. He can make no deals. He could also add something about saving democracy or something just to troll the left while he’s at it. Sends the signal- we don’t care if he were to accidentally fall down a flight of stairs or overdose on cocaine

        All too true and spot on as usual… but I think personally that something bigger may be going on here. I think that we are seeing the first flexing coming from what – for all intents and purposes – can be called the Dissident Left.Consider:We see it everywhere else too. The troons are starting to get kicked out of the military, as  are the DEI hires. The legacy media is running on fumes. They’ve fired Don Lemon and Joy Reid and the other dancing monkeys of the leftist media have been put on notice. Leftist journalists are getting mocked and derided at press meetings. The southern border is now being addressed and the Northern border will be soon. Leftist power brokers and influencers are starting to shift right, and many are openly defecting. Those that refuse to change are facing the prospect of becoming as irrelevant as Zelensky is soon going to be.It makes sense too. Leftists have brothers, sons and fathers…many of whom have been burnt by DEI hiring and promotion. They have daughters that have spent their lives training for athletic events only to face a man when they reach the pinnacle of their athletic ability. It is entirely possible that a preference cascade has started. The lunatics and rage heads are throwing public tantrums but aren’t getting any traction. The “Current Things” have grown nuttier and crazier with each passing year. Normie can no longer just  shrug it off and go out to grill on the patio and forget about it. If they have their way, the Legacy Left will send his kid to the Ukraine to fight and die for nothing.Is it inevitable they will find a new Current Thing? I dunno. The heat on the authors of the past Current Things is growing. Anti-Semitism is growing by leaps and bounds as people start to seriously question the old myths, narratives and propaganda. In a crucible like that – a leader like Trump is inevitable. In a crucible like Europe where things are much more dire… could the conditions actually bring about another You-Know-Who?I’d think that either an age of retribution or an age of logic and reason are in the offing. Possibly both…?The times, they are a-changin’.

        The liberal “good guys vs bad guys” paradigm needs to be burnt to the ground (along with “find the bigot”) and exposed as the self-serving mind-trick of the REAL bad guys.
Instead of the story of the World Wars being that “we” won over the bad guys, the question should be asked, “wouldn’t it have been better if they were not fought at all?”

        “That leaves him with no other choice but to keep the war going….he is hoping to create conditions which drag that out a bit longer.”I know what we’ve said before regarding morality and such and politics, but really—every day this creature (Zelenskyy) remains in power, hundreds die.A third to half of the Ukrainian population have fled, rather than put up a resistance to the Bear.  Untold numbers of eligible males have vanished into hiding.  The cream of the male population remaining now lies dead or wounded.  Widows, orphans, unmarried girls are the heritage Zelenskyy has left his people.  Is it justice that  Zelenskyy and his cronies continue to draw breath?If Zelenskyy survives the year out, it will be proof of the old saying, “There is no justice in this world.”

        I see matters very differently indeed.I see Zelensky, Trump and his administration, and the UK and European leaders; as equally puppets (some knowingly, other duped) who are diligently performing their allocated roles in an overarching, and so-far highly successful, geopolitical strategy.At the end of which the NATO generated and sustained Ukrainian war can complete its objective of annihilating Ukraine, while “extending”/ weakening Russia; and then the European nations can line up for their turns at the same treatment.I believe the current Ukr strategy is called “substitution” (i.e. of Europe/UK for the US in Ukraine – freeing the US for other destructive work).Meanwhile the US will pivot to wars elsewhere – either/and Taiwan or in the Middle East. This is (in some powerful circles) the official and explicit US long-term foreign policy.The point is Not for Europe/UK to *win* (just as it was not the intention for Ukrain-NATO to win) – obviously they can’t; but to accelerate their ongoing national destruction by adding war to the toxic mixture.Also, there are evidently people with geopolitical power who want to trigger an escalating global nuclear war – and the arrival of the recently promised “peacekeeping” “boots on the ground” of Ukraine from the UK/ Europe armed forces, is likely to do exactly that.

            Not really.  The masses are easily led into war.  Those who remain behind the lines have not experienced the pain, suffering, and horror—but they do experience the insult of a foreign entity “attacking” them.  Flag waving and parades are easy.During the Nuremberg Trials, Goring reportedly said:“Naturally, the common people don’t want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country”In my life experience, I’ve found nothing incorrect in his observation.

        He (Zelenski) could have been free and clear if he hadn’t suspended elections in Ukraine, so there’s somthing more going on IMO. The poor f***er’s in a personally desperate situation now which is why he went full retard.

        There can be no peace as long as Zelensky is around.  Vance and Trump tried to get him to realize his “no peace, no cease-fire” stance is an obstacle, but that was in vain.  Now that everyone knows it, either Zelensky goes, or the U.S. will walk away and leave the Euros to deal with the petulant little prick.If Zelensky was half the man the media makes him out to be, he would have sat down with the Russians after he gave them a bloody nose outside Kiev and saved what he could of Ukraine.  But he’s no Mannerheim;  he’s just a petulant little prick spending our money, while no doubt skimming enough to keep himself in new black tee-shirts.

        Even before this happened, I was guessing the European leaders were arguing over who gets stuck with Zelensky when the war ends.  If the British had a better government they could tell him he could live in Bermuda, but would never be allowed back into Europe again.  As it stands now, it appears I was wrong and none of them can even fathom the possibility of the war ending.  Total insanity.

            There’s a London neighborhood full of exiled dictators from all over the world. What looks like a normal old swingin’ townhouse there might extend downwardlike an upside-down skyscraper, barracking dozens of servants and Lamborghinis like soldiers and warheads in a missile silo, etc. They used to feature in architecture and design magazines all the time, before the “open society” people closed their world to us. Zelensky’s presided over enough death to earn him a great big corner house and five or ten generations of tax-funded “wealth.” He’s a job creator!

        Nailed it in the 9th paragraph. Zelensky has built up a such a siege train of graft dependents–military, oligarchs, whole bureaucracy (we pay their pensions) that he has to keep up the whole chicken dance.  Otherwise he has no utility to them, but is a risk, since he likely knows where the money went.  That gives him lifespan less than the half life of Element 103.

        The last ditch efforts to drag us into a war are fading fast.  Trump just needs to keep chanting “Peace!”
He hasn’t started pulling important bucks from the wall yet like funding, US troops there to provide “training”, contractors, etc.
Europe risks losing their security umbrella, UK/Canada “Five Eyes” intelligence sharing, etc.
Zelensky is the club Trump is using to knock the legs out that are holding up the NATO table.
The American People do not want war with Russia.  Everyone sees these “peace keeping” troop plans for what they are.

            Chanting “peace” is one thing.  Getting entangled in trade deals another.  Peace is separation from such entanglements.  Pulling up stakes and having no interests in the future of Ukraine.  That ensures peace.

                Not long after I posted my comment, just minutes ago, Trump announced a pause in military aid.  I don’t mean mindless chanting.  I mean “Peace,” the way I used to just keep asking my students “Why?” until they broke down.  Until you break them down, you’ll get no real change out of them.
Same with Ukraine and the Europeans.  Just keep demanding an answer to one, simple, thing.  Then slowly start removing structures supporting the operation like funding.

        europe cannot form an army to fight russia (or any other foe).  why?  it will lead directly to civil war in any eu country that tries. again, why?  because it will require a draft, and the muslims and africans absolutely will not serve and fight for their “host” countries.  so the native population is expected to serve, in order to “protect” these invaders?!  as soon as you give a native european a gun he will use it to shoot the nearest globalist.

        “Once Zelensky is gone, the war ends, and the process of developing new, normalized relations in Europe begins as we exit the post-Cold War world.”
The only question is how much damage do the Eurocrats want to inflict on their nations before that normalization begins?  The girl bosses and their servile eunuchs genuinely seem like they want to burn it all down if they don’t get their way.

        I see the Golden Collar progressives in a dominance battle with the Kill Amalek mummies; one camp is looking to the future while the other is stuck in the past.Trump, the fulcrum, has cleverly handed the Ukraine albatross to the EU’s eager hands; they see a chance to create an EU Army for domestic use (!), while Trump’s backers see a chance to pull off a revolutionary Bretton Woods II.Enmeshing Europe under a web of fresh war loans will weaken the euro. Trump’s backers want to focus on collateralizing not just gold (revaluing the Ft. Knox gold from $42/oz to $2800/oz), but the landmass of North America (including Greenland/Canada).Dumping the Ukraine corruption sump and disrupting the euro means we can safely weaken (inflate) the dollar as part of that re-collateralization, and not have it compete against a stronger euro.This will do two things: allow us to retire old T-bonds to make space for new bonds, easing our debt load, while converting the dollar from debt-backed IOUs to an asset-linked currency with our reshoring industries under tariff protection.Bankers on both continents will win, so they’ll take the deal; soon enough, they’ll be able to collateralize Europe’s assets as well, ensuring a successful conversion from debt-laden fiat and into a new order.We’ll convert to a Chinese system featuring a sovereign wealth fund and possibly a dual domestic/international currency, one for consumption and the other for settlement.  The State will be able to direct investment towards national priorities (and thus squelching future competitors.)This will likely be as good for us domestic citizens as it will be for the ruling class. That boom depends on if they keep the immigration door open.A caveat is that things will get more expensive for a long time, but we lost 75% of our purchasing power in the 70s which allowed the government to get ahead of its debt load. (This new revaluation / conversion may be up to 90% inflation.)Lastly, sacrificing the failed Ukraine albatross will allow a pivot to saving Israel. I’m hoping our clever masters will tie themselves up in another fine mess of their own making there, because I expect their grip to strengthen if we solve their debt problem for them (and, well, hand them ownership of our nation on a silver platter.)

        Excellent article, Z Man, as always, but may I demur on one point? I believe that the Europeans *will* go to war against Russia. They might try a false flag in the hope of drawing “our” country into the war,and who knows what might happen then? I think that the wording of Article Five of the NATO treaty does not absolutely obligate the US to enter into hostilities, but that has never been tested. In any event, only Congress can declare war and, if worse comes to worst, Trump could insist on that and put Congress in the position in which the war would be on them, but I doubt that they would declare war on Russia since it would be the end of their careers and they know that, which is why they have not declared war since 1941. And all war is logistics, and it would simply be impossible to prosecute a war halfway around the world–on Russia’s doorstep–b/c Russia has a navy and it is no longer the 1940s; we don’t have the industrial capacity; and Russia has hypersonic missiles, against which nobody has a defence.Nevertheless, I do expect a war between the EU/NATO  and Russia, albeit without the US.
