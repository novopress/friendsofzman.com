        They’ll also compete to display participation in marathons, triathlons etc. Now they have beach access stickers from Martha’s Vinyard on their SUVs. I don’t know how they’ll meter access to places like that in the future.
They sure as hell won’t let me in, that’s all.

        Here on the outskirts of the Imperial City an acquaintance refers to “titleitis.”  This is the seeking of impressive sounding titles for your job that look good on business cards and LinkedIn profile pages. Money is not as much a measure of value as the title.  He decided differently and quit his GS-12 job, started a business, and got to where he worked 1 day a week and had the other 6 off with a 6 figure income.  No impressive title but he was home for his kids when they got back from school.

        Having spent a lot of time with NYC young professionals, the status competition seems to center on:1. Education, as you said.2. Exercising. This is a great one, as there’s no way you can just buy a really toned body. You need to put in a lot of time at the gym, ideally some expensive kind (Crossfit, Soulcycle, Equinox) to look like that. It’s interesting to look at female models from the sixties, pre-workout trend. They are thin, but they aren’t muscular.3. Experiences. Stuff is cheap and everyone has lots of it, so now you status signal by vacationing ever further off the beaten track, dining in more interesting and hip restaurants and seeing more professional theater productions (Hamilton, anyone?).

        That access to women thing never works out. It’s fine in the beginning, but then you get into ” I want something new to wear ” and ” You never take me any place ” and the perennial ” I need new shoes. ”  And she does need something new to wear , because while you were out hunting she ate the last of the buffalo. Now she can’t wear the summer clothes and shoes.:-)
But she sure can cook. Warm in winter, too.

        The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein gives rise to Philip K. Dick questioning if Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.  The next thing you know, Harrison Ford is a Blade Runner tracking down a robot that crushed the head of its creator with its own hands while using its human-like, hydraulic digits to gouge in the creator’s eyes.There seems to be a pattern here.  First, the seed of mankind’s imagination impregnates reality and soon a premature Zombie Baby is born with black eyes and a cannibalistic desire for its own parents.When I was a kid watching the Jetsons, I knew I would be in the future when I could see someone as I spoke to them on the phone.  I actually told this to someone the other day in a different time zone than me as we were conversing on Skype.But I never dreamed man would be foolish enough to bring the Stormtroopers into being from Star Wars.  Why?  The next step will be an Arnold Schwarzenegger doppelganging cyborg  holding out its robotic hand as we give it the keys to Skynet.Why do the illegitimate children of the Technocrats often seem so creepy?  Maybe it’s genetic.  Or, perhaps it’s because they live, but have no soul.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chpFSAdYyhA
