        I live near Uni HS;my kids go/went there.  Here’s the kind of NAM you see there: Kobe Bryant rents the stadium/playing field for his daughter’s soccer team to use.  My son has seen Mr Bryant there on several occasions.   No shots were exchanged…

        Jonah Goldberg is no prize.  He cheerlead into the dumb war and that had a stupid idea to end it.
I’m not shocked he got along with Klein.  Klein’s Vox is cheerleading for war with Russia.

        Ezra Klein is the epitome of glib, articulate and stupid. Bullshit flows out of his brain at an alarming pace..
I notice you didn’t quote Ezra on the superiority of the Dorian Johnson narrative to the Darren Wilson testimony. If I were ever close enough to Klein I think I would puke on him.

        Ezra Klein is an asshole. Not the jerk kind of asshole. The kind lacking in a sense of self-awareness and their place in the world.I listened to one of his vox videos once. Could watch more than 30 secs. He is loves the sound of his voice. He is the epitome of mental masturbation.When you see him voxsplaining something you are watching someone take a completely asinine position and back flip and somersault towards some sense of reason. And when you thinks he sticks the landing its as if you can see himself say to himself. Ez, that was truly amazing what you did.

        It is likely true that perhaps all of Klein’s circle of friends become less violent when stoned, but then again they never had much capacity for violence in the first place. A second element of behavior which the drug acts upon is impulse control, of which that same group possesses an abundance and for the same reason that it lacks in violence.Now when a person has a great capacity for violence the effect of THC may be to reduce the great capacity for violence somewhat but while at the same time reducing impulse control, of which there was never very much to begin with. It is also very unhelpful that a huge male of very limited intellectual capacities is encouraged to believe that his shit does not stink and that certain others are conspiring to keep him down, when what they are conspiring to do is bag his shit.None of this would have happened if Ezra Klein had not hired armed men to expropriate my earnings to pay Michael Browns retarded mother to raise (for want of a better term) nine retarded kids in an environment that is so unnatural that it boggles the mind and thumbs it’s nose at the god of it’s creators–evolution.

        Picture is a hoax — it’s an Oregon murder suspect, not Michael Brown.
