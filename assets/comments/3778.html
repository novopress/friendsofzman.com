        Global warming is one of the great con jobs of our time, designed to enrich scientists, who are 99 percent in academia, and redistribute wealth from the private sector to governments, including the UN. Environmentalism has become the religion of the left, and global warming is its doomsday scenario. Al Gore is the messiah.

        Global warming “science” follows the same model as Bigfoot studies, UFO institutes, or JFK conspiracy groups. The only folks researching these things are already true believers, who can’t afford to design a falsifiable experiment.

        Western society took off beginning with the Renaissance rediscovery of Roman and Greek civilizations, not their math. The greatest leap forward was the contribution of British custom and law, which did come to rule the world and provide an environment for calculus to flourish in.Nothing in human development is so crucial as the development of positive custom and tradition, or as difficult to evolve. Math does not evolve, it has always existed exactly as it is. Math is discovery, not invention.The English had progressed furthest of all people in three important things–piety, commerce and freedom–MontesquieuWhen Europeans landed in China three hundred years ago, they found there that almost all the arts had reached a certain degree of perfection and were surprised that they had not improved beyond that point. It was an industrial nation where most scientific processes had been preserved, while science itself was dead. That explained the unusually static quality of mind of this nation. The Chinese, in following the path of their ancestors, had mislaid the reasons for the direction the latter had chosen. They still used the formula without asking why; they kept the tool but they had lost the skills to adapt or replace it. The Chinese were, therefore, not able to change anything and had to abandon any notion of improvement. The well of human knowledge had dried up and although the flow still ran, it could neither increase its volume nor change its course–Tocqueville

        In my free time I like to work math puzzles and learn machine languages. That’s not to say all the other stuff is unimportant or useless, but I put it into the leisure activity category. Western society took off with Calculus, not the Canterbury Tales.hmmm …Historically speaking, they are both equally important.  If you only studied math and not writing you would not be able to write this blog. Can society become advanced without language and a means to convey it? I don’t think there is a simple example. Even the Egyptians, who used glyphs, still had to write the stuff down.

        There are small tricks the hoaxers perform to make their ‘case’ such as the time a few years when data from a Russian weather station for October was missing so the September figures were simply re-used.Given that there is a huge difference between September and October temperatures in Russia then more global warmist hysterics could begin.The polar bear issue is funny because there are culls of polar bears because their numbers grow so big they are a danger to a lot of wildlife and humans. No one would cull a species that wasn’t on the increase, but the warmists are too dozy to realise that.When you are frothing at the mouth, facts merely irritate…

        But, but, but the science is settled.  Why should we look further, just hop on the hoax.  I read an article about 20 years ago that asked, after the fall of the Soviet Union, where did all the communists and sympathizers go?  It answered by stating they went to the environmental movement after their economic/political model was found unworkable.  That explains a lot.

        Greece has been a melodrama since 2010. the pundits said it would pull the rest of Europe and the world into a crisis, with the dow at record highs, so much for that.
