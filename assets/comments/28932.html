        OT and a specialist festoon for the new year;
I know we are moving towards unplugging from the puppet show, but if you get a chance, I highly recommend watching “Yellowstone” on Paramount network.
No bullshit white folk who work their asses off and if one deems to mess with them, well, it’s a trip to the train station.
Watch it before it’s deemed “Too white”.

            I have no idea where “specialist festoon” came from
Damn auto correct
And the worst part is, I have no idea what I intended to write.

        Oregon’s noxious and barely thought out Measure 114 gun control law is declared unconstitutional before it gets to the Supreme Court. In response, the entire shitlib white populations of Portland and Salem commit mass suicide by drinking cyanide laced hipster microbrew.The outside world fails to notice for several months until a weather station in Bozeman, MT records anomalously low quantities of cannabis containing particulate matter for several weeks running. The meteorologist on duty is quoted as saying “well, it seems they all died months ago but it took that long for the weed haze to dissipate.”Oregon’s population, now consisting entirely of Portland Blacks and East-state irrigation farmers agrees to divide the state with the Western 1/3 going to California and the remaining 2/3 joining Idaho. Both regions pass a measure resolving to never speak of the departed population. Rufus Washington III, a prominent Gresham crack dealer and slumlord is quoted as saying “Dem rednecks and I don’t agree on much but we all glad ‘dem handlebar mustache muffuggas is gone.”

        My prediction for Lagos on the Chesapeake, here:1) Our stylish mayor starts to visibly up his sights for a national position, and the groveling whites (not deserving a capital ‘W’), here, will eat it up,2) Inflation and general decrepitude will spiral out, but really that has been going on inside the loop for a while and the whites will just lap it up and hope it pays forward for the lesser beings,3) The new gov for MD will throw bones to this city and it will keep things somewhat placid, despite the murderiness,4) Hopkins, the institution, will get larger with fed dollars to ‘study democracy’s challenges’ in much the same way that they were ‘studying a pandemic’ just before the coof madness…watch this space,5) The squeegee gangsters will not disappear from the intersectionsNothing too radical, which is maybe projecting (?). Just hoping to make some  dough and keep my boat fishing.

        Poles are already there, 15K strong. There aren’t many Ukrainians left at the front, at least according to some:

            No way.Not sure what’s your idea of polish involvement in this mess, but support for Ukrainian cause is not very popular in Poland, and there is a thick, red line between humanitarian aid for civilians fleeing war on one side (already considered burdensome), and direct involvement in kinetic exchange with Russia. At least for now, and absent some major escalatory event, it would take time to overcome this reluctance.There was a lot bad blood between Poland and Ukraine, going back centuries, and last flare up ended up with tens of thousands  of polish civilians butchered (literally) by Ukrainians during WWII, and more recently, Ukraine was viewed as corrupt, provocative, backward country ran by crooks, so overall image of Ukraine in Poland is nowhere near as good as it may seem.Also, Poland is a fairly small country, with roughly 38M people in total, and sending 15k regulars into meatgrinder would be impossible to hide from public. these people have families and friends, there is no way in the world  government would pull stunt like that and keep everyone in the dark, and again, support for involvement in war with Russia is at near zero among general public.Looks like Polish government is trying hard to up their game with major arms purchase and army reserve drills announced recently, but they’re at years away from getting their act together under the best circumstances.

                        Just to clarify, sending 15 000 soldiers to fight in Ukraine will not happen until there is a state war between Poland and Russia.If you think that Poland can send this kind of force, just like that,  into the territory other sovereign country, to fight another sovereign country, then I’ve got nothing for you. That’s just wrong on too many levels.
But even if you put my opinion  aside, I’m not sure how“Up to 200,000 Poles to be called up for military training next year”proves that“Poles are already there”.
That’s sounds like experimental logic.

        Due to lack of Russian/Ukrainian fertilizer, famine will break out in Africa.   Despite widespread food shortages in the USA, the Biden administration will ship American grain to “People of Color” in the equatorial regions, gleefully starving the Deplorables, while feasting on lucullan delights paid for by Zuckerberg/Gates.  South African Navy vessels will intercept and piratize grain ships passing through the Southern Ocean carrying grain to China, resulting in a Chinese invasion of South Africa rather than the expected invasion of Taiwan.  China will win, and soon establish a 21st. century African slave trade.

                Enter the Middle Easterners.  There is already an active slave market in Libya, thanks to Hill &amp; BO.  You can buy a human being for as little as $200 US!  Plus, China can use sub-Saharan Africans to replace its Uighur slaves as they die off naturally, or as the result of organ harvesting.

        Sorry to hear you didn’t make the Lagos Exodus® but I totally get where you are coming from. Picking up everything is exceptionally complex as I am also finding out myself.Just as you were trying to flee Lagos I also was desperately trying to flee Sodom on Potomac (DC) and also to no avail. I had nascent plans lined up for a radical exit to Europe and my company basically told me to pound sand whichmajorlythrows off my long term plans. I will still get there because it is where I want to go but it will be a longer term thing.In the short term, because they are being a-holes and playing hard ball for no good reason I will be highly abusing my ‘work from anywhere’ ability by becoming a true digital nomad this year.I’m going to do some serious exploration of the in-between places to see if perhaps I can find somewhere domestically I can hang my hat for a while. Will start probably in Appalachia as well and wind my way down to FL, then cut west across the southern states but taking a VERY sharp turn north before the sh-thole that is California. Up through Nevada, Utah, and finally Montana.Will be taking copious notes and probably keep a travel journal as well as dropping dissident knowledge in any normie ear I encounter on my travels.I will then slow start ratcheting up my radius to US territories using a hardware VPN. US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, etc. simply to test whether I am going to get popped or if my VPN is rock solid. If it goes well for 3-6 months then I will step a bit farther out, British VI, Caribbean. If THAT goes well for another 90 days then I’m pretty much in the clear and can be in Europe on the downlow with no one being any the wiser.Where the is a Will, there is a Way, as the old saying goes. Hope you also get to where you want to be ultimately Z. ✌

            That would be an interesting travel blog. I’d follow along and toss some Bitcoin at it. Oh, and Alzebo’s post below reminds me that I have also forgotten to wish you, Z, and everyone a Happy New Year. I actually mean it. You guys provide moral support and fellowship I don’t get anywhere else. Sadly, I’ve not found any local groups that quite provide what I get here even though I’m a member of a local “People’s Rights” chapter. Those guys are sort of “dissident lite” and are moving the right way.

        I’ll first reup mine from yesterday, which is a variation of Z’s prediction about Europe:NATO (the GAE, obviously) overtly will intervene next winter in domestic European civil unrest over energy and possibly food disruptions and shortages. This will get really serious really fast if that happens in Germany and/or is violent, the latter of which is likely. Additionally, the immigrant populations will prove especially dangerous. The GAE and its British, Australian and Canadian puppet states will pull out all stops to censor the story and keep their own populations placated and unaware as much as possible. Musk will be told to spike the story and he will. Whether the Anglosphere pacification can be done will depend on domestic economic conditions, which are likely to be quite bad on both sides of the Atlantic.I also expect an astonishing amount of civil liberty and human rights violations due to “national security” in relation to the above. We will be lucky to have comments sections such as this one by the year’s end, and the censorship will be blatant and out in the open “for the children” (of invaders). People will start to be physically as well as digitally disappeared. I actually thought that happened with that flaming shitheel McInnes earlier this year.I don’t know whether this will be next year or 2024, but the first Cloud will be assassination, likely at the hands of someone put on the inside by another Cloud. I’m thinking of something less obvious than Musk, who will be “assassinated” by the police state apparatus in other ways.Outlier predictions are a nuclear war, bank runs that actually are engineered by the State to lay the groundwork for CBDC, and China and the United States backstabbing Russia (if that is not happening now). In domestic politics, expect Bush types to become more and more open in their support of and membership in the Left. That last really isn’t an outlier.Happy New Year’s and here’s to hoping most of that is wrong!

                That’s great, thanks man. I go back and forth on China’s role in this catastrophic retardation. They’ve bribed everyone in the D.C. political and corporate classes, but they do seem to be distancing. That indicates the latter for sure.

        Seems like the big prediction is whether or not the US will weasel out of Ukraine once it’s clear Russia has won, or if the government will feel like it can’t back down and we get the final solution to global warming in the form of most major cities becoming particulate matter in the upper atmosphere.

            “I don’t care how many die as long as one of them is you” is probably the correct attitude toward all our leaders—or, it’s the least bad result we can expect.
I’d love to believe Putin would hit DC/NYC/etc., but he won’t, ever, because he’s one of them—the least bad one, maybe, but absolutely and irredeemably one. If he’s chuckin’ nukes he’ll target those of us he calls Nazis and racists, because he’s *not us*. He’s much more Trudeau/Schwab/Bankman.

        Forgive me if this has been predicted already in the comments below:In 2023, the FBI will stop releasing crime data on the race of perps. As we know, this has been used by our side for a long time to show people reality. However, we can be dismissed as bad people heretics. What they can’t sweep under the rug is AI. You can do a google search to find the articles, but the prevailing orthodoxy is extremely concerned that AI is noticing these patterns. As these articles mention, “bad” data in, bad out. Thus, they will eliminate the “bad” data, just as they are with SATs and intelligence testing.

            I agree it will happen although the system probably cannot be dismantled in 2023 but will be in 2024 or maybe a bit later. It is frankly shocking this hasn’t been done or the books haven’t been cooked (if they have not been). Don’t discount falsifying White crimes as they do with the false terrorism claims.

Same here.
I was well aware of Bitcoin in 2010-2011 and failed to throw $1k at it for a laugh.
Looking back, I feel similarly about TSLA and NFLX, mainly because I refused to accept what the hype and psychology behind them were going to do.

        I believe you’re wrong Z. Inflation is here to stay. It’s either destroy the dollar as reserve currency or curb inflation, so we’re going to learn to live with it. If they dry up the flow of dollars then what is the world going to use to trade with? No, reserve currency will be defended to the bitterest of ends. They’ll use what they’ve learned about market based commodity price controls to keep inflation down on certain key sectors, and then the media will just muddy the waters to hide it, and anybody brave enough to notice will be called a White Supremacist.

            50 years ago, who could predict the petrodollar? Globohomo will have (no doubt already does have) another outside the box gambit to save their reserve currency. Some say that’s what the jab was primarily about, to force the whole world to buy American jabs with US dollars in perpetuity. I tend to believe that’s true. But it didn’t go over as well as they hoped. Even most of the jabbed don’t want to keep taking them forever.I’ve posted before that I think their next plan is to destroy the Euro and get Europe using the US dollar. Hard to say if 2023 is the year. Maybe.

I also saw some good arguments about the rise of the jab-o-dollar.
At this point I think it more likely we’ll see a two-tiered currency system where workers on the global plantation will be forced into using nearly worthless, programmable digital chits and the important people will be allowed to continue using a version of legacy currency or some new, asset-backed system.

                    I moved to Vermont from Massachusetts last year. I feel like I can breathe for the first time in many decades. I can open carry without any kind of license. No one gives a shit if I go down to the sand pit and shoot shotguns. Bernie and the Moonbat blow-ins in Burlington are a long way off. I don’t care abouth them. People around here don’t constantly seek to control you despite a healthy population of lefties. Plus the cold keeps out a lot of people I’d rather not be around. The place is pristine. It’s worthy of consideration for our side looking for a positive change. The more of us the better.

                        If you don’t like snow and a six month winter, Vermont is probably not for you. If you are game, it is quite possible to acclimate. As we get older we tend to spend more time indoors and curse the cold. The more we run from car to office to house the worse our cold tolerance becomes. This can be reversed. I’m 60 and semi-retired. My part-time retirement job is spending 8 hours a day outdoors at a ski area. Often in -20 wind chill. I could do it naked at this point.

The Bastards are encouraging illegal immigration for a multitude of reasons but a devastating one is that they bring in cheap drugs that are destroying many lives. Sad, sinful, Satanic.

        Already made some predictions yesterday, but I’ll make some more.– The USA vax mandate for foreigners is finally lifted in 2023, and I can now freely cross the border again. I drive to West Virginia and visit Z for lunch at his new home. (Yes, purebloods are still banned from the USA if they’re not citizens for both land and plane entries).– Canada kills more and more of its people with the MAID (medical assistance in dying) program, and MAID becomes the #3 cause of death. Boomers start offing themselves in droves, and homeless/poor/mentally ill people continue to increase their numbers. 95% of the people being euthanized will be White.– Trudeau calls a spring election and narrowly wins, exclusively due to “ethnic” votes in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Nobody will mention this other than the Conservatives, who will take it to mean that they need to move to the left and pander harder to aliens. The country continues to become more divided across various lines.– Open borders continues and increases across the entire west. Your town WILL be flooded with aliens.– Kanye West basically falls off the map.– Trump continues to make a fool of himself and his sinking ship keeps sinking. He won’t be arrested but his antics and grifting will make him a clown and he won’t win the nomination in 2024.

            I was just in a couple small towns in a region that is supposedly 95% White.
There were already obvious colonies of Mayans and Sikhs. I overheard plenty of Spanish conversations at the local grocery stores.

                Could be surprisingly White or surprisingly not White depending on where you are and at what time.
Generally the tourist spots, public transit, public events and malls are extremely non-white. But if you’re in the right circles, things go surprisingly white. No guarantees they won’t be idiots though. Not even the childless white libtards like to mingle with all the aliens.
Have fun, let me know how you find things.

            I’m of several minds about things like MAID. I recognize that, living in Oregon, I’ve developed a completely over the top racism against shitlib whites. I really, really hate the fuckers a lot more than negros, hispanics, or any other group really. A few days ago a YouTube commercial for some IT product came on featuring a white guy with a hipster mustache. I clicked “skip ad” faster than I do for any gyrating negros selling whatever. I’m sure a few days “vacation” back in my old hood in Baltimore would cure me of that of course.The idea of them getting help from the Canadian (or US) government to off themselves doesn’t bother me that much though I realize it weakens the (on paper) demographic of Whites. How am I wrong here?

                You bring up a great point. We here on the alt-right spend a lot of time bitching and moaning about the depredations of Negroes and the hordes of Mexicans overrunning the border, and rightly so.But the fact is that none of them could get away with anything if it weren’t for shitlib whites. Eisenhower rounded up millions of illegal Mexicans and sent them packing. During the same era it would have been unthinkable for a black to rape a white woman, knock out an elderly white, or chimp out in a public restaurant or retail store or on an airplane.Blacks are only 13% of the population, if the white population were united, the “Negro problem” would be readily dealt with. But they aren’t.We spend a lot of time referring to “whites” as if they were a monolithic group, but the reality is that shitlib whites are our biggest enemy, and they are merely using nonwhites as pawns against us.

                The main problem with MAID is that the doctors start badgering patients and trying to get them to kill themselves whenever treatment would be expensive or a hassle.  My recent experience with hospitals is that they already try to hard sell you into signing DNR orders so that if something happens while you’re there they don’t have to do anything to save your life.
Remember that nearly all doctors now are pajeets or ching chongs, and they don’t have any sort of empathy for the white boomers coming in with medical problems.

        I predict we will retreat from Ukraine as well but refuse to give back all the stuff we stole from Russia, which is at least tens of billions of dollars of assets, if not hundreds of billions. Russia, feeling victorious, now utilizes their newfound leverage to continue to launch brutal trade wars in response. The media will spin it as Russia being mean again, without explaining why we decided to be the world’s sorest losers.I expect Europe to meekly accept de-industrialization but there will begin to be groundswells of far right European movements that reject America, the EU, and globalization. Nothing significant for 2023 but more and more Euros are going to start putting two and two together and realize how much of a sham it all is.

        Based on the Dirt People -&gt; Ukraine -&gt; Blackrock news announced yesterday and the 70 Asian advocacy groups demanding that the US Congress take up reparations, I would say the predictions are not pessimistic enough in terms of where the regime is headed.I just finished a read of this. It is one of the most astounding confessions of subversion and hypocrisy, (group advocacy for me but not for Brimelow, Buchanan and thee), I have ever encountered. heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/8782.pdf Some of the concerns and confession expressed on page 11 and the events since 2020 indicate that things have spun beyond one group’s control and passed to others.I predict ever harsher and more lashing out as the balkanizing trends discussed in this paper and the Gollums its author and affiliates unleashed but can’t control grow bigger and more aggressive.I predict that atomized people like us commenters will continue to struggle to find off-line communities. I predict that rifts like we see with ZMan and Anton will have to be carefully managed. I think there is huge if not complete overlap in DR and DR-lite (New Founding), interests driven not just by the 2020 political revolution, but because part of that revolution is an ever escalating anti-white race war. The NF guys are far more organized and are beginning to offer things of value to our people – namely a community where we can be employed and not discriminated against. I predict that they will be pushed ever closer toward some of our positions and we will need to capitalize on and support that support structure that they have erected. Ideological and class disputes (they are Clouds and we are Dirts), must not prevent being practical, strategic and wise.I predict that somewhere in the DR someone who has been organizing to politically capture just one town, one simple town with a long term plan to capture an entire county and then an entire state will succeed. I predict that more of those someones will do the same in their area, and will coordinate with each other to form a larger area that someday becomes contiguous and ever larger.I predict that if we focus on ourselves being active instead of being reactive to them, we will slowly create something that our grandchildren’s grandchildren will honor us for having the courage and the wisdom to initiate.

        It would be ridiculous to consider elite-sanctioned human sacrifice ridiculous. No abomination is beyond the archfiends. The question is, Kto kogo? I think it is readily apparent that normal white people will the targets of human sacrifice exhortations, and that we will be told it is our duty to do this in expiation of our so-called “white privilege” and as a form of reparations to the sainted and immaculate negroes. Instead of white-hot statues of Molloch, however, the chosen instruments of sacrifice will be superheated effigies of St. George Floyd. I wish I were chanelling my inner Jonanthan Swift.

        Predictions are hard. Public predictions are even harder. It’s difficult enough just to say who will win a sportsball game. It would be fun to revisit everyone’s predictions for 2020. I’m sure that absolutely none were anywhere close to correct.But I think predictions about inflation hanging around are probably accurate. Historically it has never gone away that fast once it has become an established thing. The regime doesn’t have any way to pay its debts other than printing. Also, they will soon have to consider either raising the eligibilty age for medicare or printing more. Bet on them to go with the easier option. That could be more of a 2025 thing than 2023.Liz Cheney will be rewarded for her service to the regime, probably with a cabinet level post in the Biden administration, allowing it to proclaim how bipartisan it is. Perhaps Special Envoy to Ukraine. But I can envision something like an Extremism Czar.There’s a good chance I will become a vegan to avoid eating animal products that may soon be injected with the mrna jabs.

            Most likely inflation ameliorates, but the new norm will be 5% or so.  It seems it can’t get back to 2% as long as we keep deficient spending, and that is unlikely.  Even 5% is better than most second and third-world crapholes.

        not sure if it will happen in 2023 but the GOP is doomed.   the failure of the red wave this year, mcconnell giving all the dumb ass gop voters the double bird, all signs of approaching death.  they will not be replaced, instead the dem party will spinter, and lots of ethno parties will sprout.

            It’s not hard to picture a hand picked GOP candidate being allowed to move into the WH in order to keep up appearances. The question is, with the grass roots now being well trained in ballot harvesting, can the regime ever turn that off?
One waits for hispanics to assert themselves as a distinct bloc. And waits.

            The reaction to the Republican dipshit who said he’s a Jew but he isn’t (but his mother was, so he is, right? the story’s too stupid to follow) is becoming interesting. Instead of excluding freshman Republicans from being seated because they”re “insurrectionists”—as they’ve been saying they’d do for two years now—legislation has been floated to refuse to seat election winners if they *lied*. Unconstitutional, but so is everything.

        If Cozy.tv gets censored, which I don’t think it will, it’s been around almost two years now, then Nick will switch to GabTV or Rumble until he gets his own server farm like Torba has, and puts the site back online.I don’t think World War 3 will come about from border disputes or a cascade of alliances like in World War 1. I think the most likely scenario is that the regime will attempt a false flag Pearl Harbor event… which would be extremely obvious, and would be why the regime doesn’t do it.My main hope for this year is that the Right continues to become more powerful in business and local politics. The real victors of the midterms were Moms For Liberty, whose anti-CRT agenda will do more to save our schools than any congressman ever could. If everyone reading this would go and start a Moms For Liberty chapter in their hometowns, we’d gain a huge amount of power and influence over night.Likewise, we need to encourage people to run for Sheriff’s offices, DAs, and city councils. The Right needs to get college degrees, form businesses, and buy as much property as possible.As you said on a podcast, American Renaissance should set up chapters in every state too, which would absolutely swell the numbers of pro-White activists.If a National Divorce is coming, we must personally facilitate it. And it’s not going to come violently. Americans are too soft to start a civil war. Anyone who tried would immediately get shut down. The military is likely useless against foreign countries, but it wouldn’t hesitate to shut down a “fascist” uprising. No, National Divorce will happen peacefully, when the White Right have their own businesses, control over their schools, their own counterculture, and don’t depend on the system for anything.

            This is fantastic. You said much better what I tried to say.In the abstract what you and I are saying is that when there is an existing grassroots organization, (MFL, New Founding), we need to join it or add a local chapter. We must be highly skilled and prepared to dominate in a globally competitive world. We must capture local politics and law enforcement, and even not give up entirely on the national military. We need some infiltrators.Pursuing our own destiny by taking control of it today, is the only thing that will predict the survival and flourishing of us and our people in the future. Great post!

        Z, your predictions are silly! Have you learned nothing over the past few years?This is how it’s done:1. The scientist-politicians in Brussels will find a solution to the EU energy crisis after the Gates of Hell open in the basement of the European Parliament. Construction of the pipes distributing energy from the Hell Gates to surrounding countries will result in the historically biggest economic boom west of the Hajnal line.2. Bulgaria will shock and awe Romania into a quick surrender, before moving in to occupy Zakarpattia. Hungary will quickly cuck and recognize the new borders.3. Mexico will align with Russia and switch to Cyrillic alphabet. Taco stand workers in Texas will be activated and start forming guerillas.4. Biden will be pronounced President for Life and Supreme Leader of the Free World. No more “Dementia Joe” as it turns out he was faking his old age the whole time.5. Israel will repatriate all their citizens and citizenship eligible individuals. The country will become deeply isolationist. Western politicians will forget that Israel exists before the year ends.

                I fear that they loved Kanye so much is precisely because he isn’t white.One of the biggest chasms I feel with younger men, even those who agree with us, is how much they have bonded with hip hop and rap.I hired a 25 year old to do some hauling for me.  He looks like he’s in Lynyrd Skynyrd but he loves hip hop.  When he put some on and I asked him to put on something else.  He asked why and I said that I can’t enjoy music made by my racial enemy.  He just about drove us off the road in shock.When I reflect upon why Fuentes always left me cold I think his worship of rappers is a part.  (Nonetheless I always said that I would support Nick if he advanced our cause.)

                    Yes. Hip Hop and sportsball are insidious. It is fantastic that you pointed this out to Lynyrd Skynyrd. It could very well lead to some reflection that will in turn to new musical tastes. That 25 year old willing to work and do hauling is one of ours to be taken under wing and brought along gently with the occasional shock.Find an album or playlist for him to get into that isn’t pant-hooting over digitally stitched together, looped samples. Always be ready with an alternative.Nice work. Also, I noticed Fuentes uses hip-hop and techno as well as 20 year old sportsball buntu, event cheering. I won’t take any group seriously that doesn’t comport themselves with dignity and proper and traditional European/American decorum and social mores, speak proper English, dress well, listen to great music … … Fuentes is a fail on all of those accounts.I think a much more promising young guy is this young gentleman at University of Chicago who is a much better representative and fighter for himself and our cause.

                    Is rap really any worse than Boomer rock n roll?
Rock music was pretty degenerate, although less vulgar and crude than rap. Nirvana and the whole grunge culture was extremely toxic to young white men.

                        Agreed.  I know that my parents felt alienated from me when I was a young metal head.
One difference between hip hop and degenerate white music is the implicit and explicit antiwhiteness of the former.
But ultimately, I’m not arguing that my music is better, rather I am just describing one reason for my alienation from many young people.

        “ The Germans will start talking about lands they lost to Poland after the war. ”This prediction is less bold, than interesting.  The issue will/must arise—as it has in Ukraine—not about land and ancient borders, but of the *people*, their ethnicity, and culture who now occupy this land.  This is an area we (DR) can all take interest in!Not a great historian, but as I recall wrt Germany, their lands were lost, but also the ethnic Germans living there were driven back to Germany by the millions or summarily executed.  The people of the time noting how those ethnic Germans were and would continue to be a 5th column in their newly defined country’s post WWII borders.It will be fascinating to see how countries attempt to lay claim to new borders containing no ethnic populations?  And if they do claim ethnic connections, then they’ve also laid the groundwork for such claims of others, such as DR’s.

            The story of ethnic Germans in other countries after WWII is amazing. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a million or more, were killed or died from starvation/disease as they were forcibly removed. Around 12 million Germans were kicked out and moved to Germany.
That’s ~15% of the population. That’d be 50 million people today for the US.
Anyone who thinks that once some group settles in some part of the country that they are they are there permanently doesn’t know history.

            It’s weird how the old empires allowed nations to do their thing to a great degree as long as they paid tribute and didn’t get uppity, while modern nation-states seem pretty ideological— ethnicity is part of the ideology, part of their justification. Germany and their recent history being the clearest example.Also the US, but ethnicity is a problem here, so the ideology became ethnicity. The proposition nation, or whatever they call it. The American as an idea, a citizen. It’s the nation-state dynamic without a nation to start with. Tough to pull off, so we reverted to empire without admitting it, because to admit it would be to admit the American Experiment failed.Or maybe the idea of a nation-state is flawed to begin with, in that an ethnicity can have an ideology, but ethnicity should never be the basis of ideology.At the risk of thinking too much about it, there’s clearly a relationship between the ideal and the material, but they aren’t identical, and confusing them causes great error 😂It’s almost as if empire had enough wiggle room to make it work, even if that wiggle room was the knowledge you weren’t ultimately self-determined, while the nation-state was always going to have bad results.I do think the US worked best as a continental empire, with a good degree of regional autonomy. It would seem one dog has to be alpha, and Yankeedom seized the role. In the German Empire, it was Prussia. Seems to me Hitler tried to further unite Germans, and things went sideways. Perhaps similarly in the US with DC becoming hegemonic since WWII.Idk, I’m rambling again. I like the idea of nationalism and self-determination. It’s sounds like what you ought to want, but it has to be admitted it has a spotty record. The benevolent empire (if such a thing can be said to exist) has a pretty solid record of success, until nationalism does its thing. Or at least that’s how it seems to me. Confusing stuff.

Maybe the state, too. Maybe just figuring out that the state and the people are related but separate 🤣 King of X, not King for X, if that makes any sense.

        2023 will be the year that the mRNA vaccines &amp; boosters reveal their deadly nature, which is the destruction of natural immunity. Normally healthy people are already dying at rates well above historical averages, and that reality is being intentionally concealed from the general public, but soon everyone will know someone who died unexpectedly. The Boomer Generation will take the brunt of the decline, which will lessen the load on Social Security, but the worst impact will be on the next generation of children. They will be more sickly, stunted, and programmed with insane behaviors that weaken their robustness to near zero.The social pressure cooker arising from the Crazy, augmented by inflation, recession, and excess mortality, will explode next year. Shoplifting and riots will become accepted social venting mechanisms. And when the plates stop spinning, Katie bar the door. It’s going to get interesting faster than anyone expects.

            Tom, this is not a prediction—it’s more of an established fact that simply is now generating (finally) published research and theory.  You’re cheating.  😉
However, here’s a prediction, or question.  Will the Fed’s in 2023 turn 180 degrees on their previous duplicitous stand on Covid and come clean on the whole dirty tar baby, or will they simply drop the issue into the “memory hole” ala “1984” Big Brother—and pretend that nothing of the sort ever happened or was ever said?

                No, they will double down and go all ferocious deadly tyrannical on the world. WHO now as gathered power and world countries will bend the knee. WEF has placed Young Leaders all over the world in governments everywhere. They told us years ago by Agenda 21 then Agenda 2030. Remember the maps they had on Agenda 21 website depicting most of the country looking like The Kings Park with animal corridors connecting particularly here in the west. People living in eco-friendly communities with no cars and bike paths in council housing. Notice there was anticipated many fewer people, mainly in stack-and-pack. “Evil” tells us ahead what it is going to do as per some kind of metaphysical principle of must warn ahead. You don’t pay attention, it’s on you, dirt people. You live long enough you notice this.  More lock downs, more man made pandemic bugs, more control, more push to centralized digital currency control.Ruling Overlords will be demanding mRNA in damn near everything, in your beef, in other food, aerosolized to spray on populations, bioweaponized mosquitoes. Pushing Transhumanism, changing our genetics (mRNA is an operating system injected to change one’s genetics for a specific result), goal to change us beyond being human. Most of the human race caves and gives up their Birth Right. Material consciousness, no curiosity, zombie people, feed-feed Bah! Bah! Bah!Remember Paul Ehrlich-The Population Bomb. The Malthusians only became Sauron ghastly cool and more numerous. Notice the big push, for some batch of reasons as they appear to be up against a wall of time, to population control/kill off dirt people.  Next year this will be more obvious.Why are they in such a hurry? What’s pushing them? Eyes wide open.Graham Hancock’s theory of Asteroids raining down or Ben Davidson/Chan Thomas theory of 12,000 year cycle of solar megaflare/magnetic reversal as earth loses it’s magnetosphere currently down 20-25% and losing 1% a year. Am watching and real good chewy brain food. My money on the table for the waning magnetosphere shit show setting in. Whatever it does, if you lean toward Davidson, very unpleasant, dig yourself a livable sized root cellar and get your avon raft ready if you’re young and sturdy. If you lean toward Hancock, also very unpleasant. To augment this mindset, see Derb’s book We Are Doomed.May you live in interesting times. May evil double back on itself and eat it’s tail. When we reach Chaos destruction for destruction’s sake, Chaos cannot be controlled.Oh, and Happy New Year!Bless you Z! May you remain indefatigable. Bless you Z folks! Time to think/go Grey Man.

                Neither. They will allocate a few scapegoats and blame it all on a few “rotten apples” in the otherwise wonderful CDC. I predict that the scapegoats will be Fauci, Walensky and Bourla. And of course Trump, who like the fool he has become, continues to praise the clot shots.

            In the early days of the pandemic there was regular talk about East Asians having a measure of cross-immunity due to their exposure to other, similar coronaviruses.  The numbers from China made it impossible to judge the accuracy of that claim, as their statistics have been fortified in a way that would make the DNC blush.  But when you look at other countries from the Asia-Pacific region you saw that they tended not to suffer the same effects that Europe and the Americas did.However, in 2022 that all changed in a big way.  Japan, Taiwan, the ROK, Vietnam, Australia, and New Zealand.  It seems very reasonable to believe that Big Pharma’s magik elixirs may have played a role in this reversal of fortunes; possibly because they have damaged the existing immune protections that those nations enjoyed.It remains to be seen how long lasting the effects of jabs will be.  Have they cause irreversible damage to their recipients?  It will take years to determine.

                    Sorry, I should have elaborated.  ‘Solent Green” is situated in the 1990’s on a dying earth.  Earth dying because of pollution—but that’s not my point.  Dying earth trope is the same BS we now have with Climate Change.spoiler alert (stop reading here)—————————With the planet dying, food was harvested from the sea in the form of processed plankton and distributed to the homeless masses in green crackers—“Soylent Green”.  The protagonists Heston and Robinson find out the secret of SG—it’s not plankton (the ocean is dead)—it’s *people* being processed and fed to the remaining living.One method for collecting the required numbers of dead people to feed to the living are euthanasia centers that surround the cities in large numbers.  Euthanasia centers provide a brief 20 minute euphoric respite as the effect of the administered poison takes hold.  Hundreds of people flock to these centers every hour seeking some final relief from the misery of a life they can no longer stand.  Their bodies are immediately sent to the refining plant from the center.In short, the government “entices” the populace to kill themselves through making life so unbearable, that death is preferable to living—especially for the sick and infirmed.  These centers have become an acceptable and *expected* way for the old and useless to relieve society of their burden.In that we see the beginning parallels in the Netherlands today.  Life is desirable as long as it is deemed “useful”.  It is a citizen’s duty to off themselves before becoming too burdensome to family and the broader society—or at the extremes when they become depressed or infirmed or simply scared of “natural” death.

        Predictions are fun, if somewhat worthless, so here it goes:EconomyThe economy finally goes into recession, but inflation remains high, probably ~5%, mainly because high oil prices and labor supply remaining tight. Fed holds rates ~5% hoping it will grind down the economy and get CPI down, but it doesn’t work. Stagflation has arrived.DeficitThe deficit jumps due to higher interest costs and low tax receipts because of the recession and falling asset prices. Luckily, everyone is terrified so they want treasuries so no bond market crisis. The gov kicks the debt crisis down the road again – but this is probably the last time.DollarDollar continues to strengthen because everyone wants dollars in a crisis.OilOil jumps to at least $90 a barrel, maybe more. Yes, demand falls due to recession, but that’s offset by China economy coming back online and supply falling due to no SPR and Russian production falling.EuropeEurope faces multiple crises. Energy costs threaten industry and whole economic model. Higher interest rates in US put pressure on the Euro. ECB raises interest rates even as it continues to buy Italian bonds using German money. EU doesn’t fall apart, but there are serious threats that it will unless the economy turns around.JapanJapan faces a full-blown currency crisis but holds it off by burning through its stash of treasuries. However, everyone wonders how long it can last.UkraineRussian starts to make progress. US accept a deal where the Donbas is independent and eastern Ukraine becomes a buffer zone but still part of Ukraine but with Russian troops. Western Ukraine agrees to neutrality but with a token military to save face.USBiden remains president and announces that he will run for re-election. DeSantis emerges as the front runner for GOP despite establishment opposition.All in all, no giant fireworks, just a continued grind downward. The system staggers on but continues to show more and more cracks.

        I agree with your predictions inasmuch as you’re merely saying current trends will continue. The problem arises when there’s a “phase transition” — a system moves from one set of dynamical rules to another one, as when ice becomes water or water becomes a gas, If current trends continue, the political and economic system will “qualitatively” change at some point and the old rules and the old trends will become defunct and inapplicable. Another way of putting it — though not equivalent — is that some “black swan event” will occur.

        Canada’s “kill yourself” initiative is truly one of the most monstrous policies ever conceived in the western world.  The speed from which they went to killing the terminally ill to killing depressed minors would give even the most aggressive accelerationist whiplash.It also gives a view into the mindset of your average health care hero.  The truth is, most doctors don’t care if you live or die, and will follow State protocol without question.  They don’t care as long as they have their status in society.  I’ve seen too many people walk out of med school completely different people to assume they’re teaching the Hippocratic Oath.  A deranged cult is probably more accurate.

            Fifty plus odd years ago, my physician dad was self employed as were most MDs back then.  Now virtually all of them work for some giant hospital outfit or some such.  They’re nothing more than employees and will never stray from the company line protocol.  Individual treatment be damned.  If you have such and such a cancer or other disease, this is how we’ll treat it – just like everyone else.I’ll never take a physician’s word, diagnosis or treatment at face value again.  It’s far too easy now days to do your own research and largely come to your own conclusions.

                That’s just it.  50 yo, we paid for our medical care.  Now we either are under a government program, or private insurance and the process of billing and of course malpractice insurance has driven the MD’s out of private practice.  Better to make a $100k a year hassle free, than a couple of million and employ folk to process paperwork, maintain a large building and the like.

        I’ve been in the Blue Ridge mountains for a few years around. My neighbors are all white, separated by several miles, but are all friendly. They also let you know if they’ve seen strangers nosing around your property. Z, you won’t regret such a move and with fiber spreading to even little mountain hamlets, you’ll have high-speed internet to boot. We’ve got plenty of wild game on our acreage, enough flat land to grow a very nice garden (did this growing season) and a well that provides some of the best water around. I have a two-hour commute, but I don’t mind it 4 days per week.As for predictions, the Ukraine gets carved up by lots of folks and Zelensky gets a fat retirement in Miami (think he already owns a house there). Biden collapses repeatedly and is finally replaced by the regime, along with the Indian DMV lady, by someone even worse like Gavin Newsom.More normies realize that “fortified for democracy” means no more Republican president or Senate, ever. More normies also realize that the GOP guys that do get elected are the worst kind of finks.Inflation continues. Economy collapses while our ruling class continues to be even more degenerate and rub it in our faces as diabolical narcissists are wont to do.China takes Taiwan with minimal resistance and barely a whimper from us.Gas is $5 by summer unless the economy completely implodes. Then it’ll be $3 and the tourism industry implodes as no one can afford to go anywhere.Even though the ruling classes have mandated EVs for everyone with their BS CAFE standards and mandates, the number of EVs continues to hover around 5 to 6% of the US fleet and a little more globally in 2023. Maybe the automakers see that going all EV will be their doom and rebel, but I wouldn’t count on it. These cars are unaffordable, useless in normal weather and just a hunk of metal and plastic in extreme cold or hot.

This George Santos character is actually performing a public service by aping our current day politician behavior. The “elite” react poorly to being mocked, so they will destroy him for pointing out the obvious.

        Much of the media may be preoccupied with who’s to succeed Biden in the hope of maintaining the illusion that elections matter. In the end, Biden would be the perfect stand in for himself and will be appointed to a second term as the coopted  Pubs seem to imagine that the way to win elections is to outcheat the Dems. So lots of political sound and fury as the Pubs go the way of the Whigs.Not that we’ll hear about it but the big story may be the negotiations between the American ruling elite and the CCP on the terms under which the U.S. will become a CCP satrapy with the American ruling elite becoming the CC P’s resident managers. A post-Kanye rap genre will form centered around Bill and The Bugs.

                That and an indication of the ravenousness of our elite.  Even podunk third world counties have required such industries to co-invest in factories within their countries.  And now we’re doing this?  And with such an essential product as computer chips?  Problem is it’s too late as the production lines take years to design and construct.  We are excessively dependent on Taiwan and will be lured into conflict if China moves.  We are vulnerable at least to 2030–and who knows what else lurks out there.

The GAE is also very tight on human capital due to mass Boomer retirement and the junk product coming out of the universities for the past 10 or 15 years.
There also appears to be something going on with the shots that is contributing to this tightness.
On top of this, GenX, who falls into the chronological window between folks retiring and fools graduating, is significantly smaller than the Boomer or Millennial generations by something like 15 to 20%.
Competent STEM folks in the middle and younger end of GenX will do well for several years to come.

            Hasn’t the GAE already inserted thousands of Poles in sunflower costumes into the conflict along with a smattering of Romanians?
I’m thinking they will up the ante on this.

        I think it’s only a matter of time until Biden collapses on stage somewhere. He looks terrible and the best medicine in the world they’re pumping into him can only last for so long. Russia does a WW2 style massive offensive, surrounds Ukrainian troops and game over. Ukraine is broken apart and Zelensky leaves for the U.S. and a massive retirement package. Of course, none of the loan money will be paid back and EU countries take chunks out of Ukraine for compensation. Nothing will change in states with massive mail-in-ballot fraud, hence more wokeness, poor management and moronic candidates winning, causing the U.S. to sink deeper.

            My expectation for Zelensky is not retirement. He’s on borrowed  time right now. Even if he does make it out, Russians are big on revenge and his Nazis are too. He knows where too many bodies are buried in this country to enjoy a retirement.

        A couple of reactions to these predictions:1. I’ll put my “money” on Ron DeSantis over Tim Scott as the establishment’s preferred alternative to Trump.2. I know a Romanian (Transylvanian Saxon) who who told me a while back that Romanians view Moldovans with distain and that Moldovans feel the same way about Transnistrians. Times may have changed, but according to him, in the fairly recent past Romania had no desire to unify with either of them.

        Due to the total abandonment of our southern border and the NGO-sponsored massive invasion, smaller big cities will have hordes of illegals in public places where they didn’t before.No one will complain because the media’s narrative that either “this isn’t happening or if it is it’s a good thing” is absolute.  On a subconscious level, normies have accepted that our country will become mexico and they are fine with this.The progressives in my family will remain condescending and smug even as the small town that they fled to becomes so hispanic that it causes obvious difficulties for them.  They will continue to feel morally superior to me and say that I am some combination of mistaken and evil.

                    I have to accept that a lot of you guys are resigned to becoming an hispanic country.
For me, my radicalization occurred while I was living around San Fran and experiencing the hispanic supremacy there.  A vivid memory was walking into a convenience store about 30 minutes east of the coast and being the only white guy and the only who spoke English.  Everyone in the store stared daggers at me.
Enjoy it, fellows.

                        Line:  Agree that too many here seem calmly resigned to the influx, always saying the mestizos are not as bad as blacks.  They’re thinking of the lawn guys and roofers, the sort of Mexicans who populate most of the southwest.My first exposure to large numbers of mestizos was in the DC/Va area – and they were not Mexicans, but Nicaraguans and Salvadorans.  They’re the ones filling up all the Maryland suburban high schools and stabbing people. They may not be quite as hair-trigger unpredictable as blacks, but they do not make for a White-friendly environment.  I don’t want either as my neighbors or ‘fellow countrymen.’Which is why we’re moving to a county that is 95% White.  Zman, best of wishes for your Appalachian relocation.  That’s a beautiful area, albeit too close to DC for my taste – and we’re more comfortable staying west of the Mississippi.  We’ll be on our mountain in the Ozarks, trying to help insure the area remains Orania-like.

                        It has nothing to do with resignation.  It has everything to do with prioritization of efforts.  That being said, of course the greatest demographic threat today is the open border to the South.
As to which minority is worse…here’s a thought experiment.  You board a train—the wrong train.  You find yourself in a car with a sea of Black faces.  The car beyond that, a sea of brown faces.  The “wrong train” means no White faces.
Do you take a seat, switch cars, or jump out the nearest window?  This ex-New Yorker needs your guidance.  😉

                        Compsci, I get the prioritization concern.  However, there will probably are at least as many illegals in our country as blacks now and it’s quickly getting worse.
In some places in California, there is an expectation that you assimilate to them and I expect as their numbers increase in other places that this will be more common.  I also expect that the Christian hispanics who mow people’s lawns will not object to this demand.

        Happy New Year To All!
My prediction is TNB will be alive and well and bigger and bladder than ever in the coming year.  As a result, the media will attempt go into turbocharged overdrive to not “notice”, but it’ll be so massive they might as well be sticking their finger in the proverbial dike.  They’ll then quadruple down on blaming White people for it as well as the ills of the world – word…

I saw it reported that WV had more people moving in than moving out for the first time in decades.
Good luck in the mountains.

        Great set of predictions, Mr Z.Anyway wanted to drop by and thank you for the always compelling insights and commentary, and also thank the commentators from whom I’ve learned so much – the most important of which is that I’m not alone.Relatedly, I read a couple of stories yesterday that Texas and Florida grew their populations, and that some of the inflow were “conservatives” fleeing the blue states. If this is actually accurate (that is, a de facto separation into two separate nations, following more or less the borders of the old Confederacy, which was the last legitimate nation on the current territory of the “united” “states”) then that strikes me as good thing rather than a bad thing.Also, I notice that Blackrock is going all-in on “postwar reconstruction” in Ukraine. One can only laugh.Happy new year to one and all.

                Ukraine may be more lucrative than Israel by far as long as the Russians don’t clearly win. Blackrock builds something. Russia blows it up, they get to rebuild again, everybody (who matters and has connections) wins. Only the poor dumbass American people lose. Even Russia wins in a sense because this gives them a good basis to grow their war economy even further and Russia isn’t limited in that regard by any silly qualms over “the climate”.

            The 60/40 red vote in FL in 2022 indicates the majority of new Floridians are “conservatives” fleeing the blue states, rather than leftists bringing their politics with them. Something similar could be happening in Texas.

                Jeffrey Zoar:  Texas ‘conservatives’ are civnats who love them some John Cornyn.  And most of the CA/NY relocators here are economic, not political.  And many of them are Han/subcons joining their burgeoning population here.  The other day a couple of Michigan joggers were welcoming each other as “homie” in the grocery store parking lot.
Demographically, Texas is gone.

                    “who love them some John Cornyn.”
Not so sure.  The best hope for Cornyn is the Democrats running Beta or some similar idiot against him.  If they run someone within even a ten mile radius of Gabbard, Cornyn could be forced to look for a new line of grift.  Unfortunately, for some reason the Texas Dem party seems stuck in Beta mode.

                Except that TX sees growth from Hispanics—many illegal.  In other words, home grown Leftist recruits.  FL got a lot of their “diversity” from Cuba, and of course now Conservative refugees internally for the Blue states.
I’m surprised TX has done as well as it has.  Once TX get fortified however, it’s game over.

            “Predicting that Americans will reach Mars in the next decade is fun and exciting.”Ah, come on now.  The people who have 20000 hours in Kerbal Space Program are working hard enough to go back to the moon. They still need to put in time with KSP 2 to be confident enough to write fan fiction about going to Mars!Kerbal is a game where you launch little green muppets into space. A game for children that adults with children often play themselves more than with their kids. That said, my great grandson and I are in the process of putting together a space station called Burpee 1.
