        In my fairly extensive experience of college kids, “Hitler” and “Holocaust” are functionally the same thing as “McCarthy” and “Red Scare” — a very bad guy, who did a very bad thing, because he was a right-winger.  That’s really all there is.  Even history majors have to be told what the Treaty of Versailles was.  Eugenics?  Never heard of it.  Stalin?  I think he was the enemy inGoldeneye…..As far as the population at large goes, we might as well be talking about vector calculus or Wittgenstein.  Trying to make political hay off the Holocaust today is like trying to pull the Irish vote by going on about the Corn Laws…. especially coming from a guy like Goldberg, with his unique brand of fart joke “conservatism.”

        “No one ever talks about Irish solidarity in the way we talk about Jewish solidarity or black solidarity.”  I take it you don’t live in Massachusetts?

            Lived in Boston for a long time. I was not thinking about the Beacon Hill pols. Solidarity for them is the way to survive federal prison.

        Sinking the Mayflower: A Northern woman said to my wife at a gathering in our FL retirement community: “I’ve noticed that Southern people don’t know who they are.” My wife replied that she knew who she was, she was Texan. “That’s not what I mean,” said the other woman. “I’m Italian. Annie there is Italian.” Where she was from, she said, “Italians live in Italian neighborhoods, Poles live with Poles.” Ah, yes. The Northeast, where everyone is born with a hyphen. Way too European for us simple Southern folk.

            The American South is almost unique in that it represents a place and culture that Jews managed to completely integrate into. My understanding is that these particular Jews were almost entirely Sephardic which probably has something to do with it.

        “no country has been better for Jews than America”
So it would be nice if they stopped treating it like a rental and acted like they owned it.

            Every place the Jews settle, they’re renters, not owners. History taught them well, in that regard.

        I’ll never forget how offended I was when Celia Cruz died. She fled Castro’s Cuba and became an American citizen and had a great career. But at her funeral, her casket was draped with the Cuban flag. She (or her heirs) didn’t even tip a hat to the Country which saved her.

        I once sat down and tried to tabulate all of the various slaughters my ancestors survived.  Christ, just on the Mexican side, 90% died from disease and mistreatment in the years after the conquest.  On the European side, I had to account for various English, Viking, and Roman cullings of the Scots; the 30-years war and the Roman massacres of the Germans; the Frisian diaspora… you could go on forever, right?  If you add that all up, it is about the same as what the Tribe has been through these past 3,000 years.The difference between me and a member of the Tribe, is that the Hebrews roll all that killing up in one big narrative of persecution.  The reality is that given our shared bloody and violent past,everyonehas more or less the same amount of cruelty, pestilence, and plague in their family woodpile.  Most of us have just never run the tally.

That’s pretty much everything you need to know about the “holocaust”, right there.

            I’ve traced some of my ancestors back to the late middle ages. They all seem to have moved out when the local tyrant got too mean. Huguenots  -&gt; Switzerland, Scotch Presbyterians-&gt; Ulster etc. Could be why when it’s fight or flee time, I usually flee.

        I’ve been a skeptic of the mantra “never again” for over fifty years. Left wing politics guarantee the same thing will happen over and over again. Just as bad, their strategy in politics is argumentative but in self-defense it is surrender,.  typical left wing politics below the level of Bolshevik. Kristol, Goldberg–Goldman, Horowitz. I know whose side I’d pick in a fight.

            In a fight, I want Horowitz on my side. Goldberg is useless and Kristol is a weasel. I like David Goldman, but I’m not sure he is much of a fighter. Horowitz shows up with with brass knuckles, a spiked club, a length of chain and a few guns. That’s not a guy you want as an enemy.

        “There’s only so long that a festering carbuncle like John Podhoretz can do this…”You may be more right than you realize.  Very few journals of opinion can support themselves just by subscription revenue. They almost always require some group of financial angels to support them, especially when paying $400k to the editor. Commentary is not one of the exceptions. And credible people have told me that the mean age of Commentary subscribers (25,000 of them, at most) and angels is something like 75.I strongly suspect that the checks they are writing now are due to the residual respect for pere rather than fils.BTW, I share your positive opinion of “Spengler.”

        John Podhoretz is his father’s kid.  Here’s Norman:
Today Commentary regularly publishes essays that sound, in Balint’s apt words, “like speeches intended to buck up the troops or self-congratulatory sermons to the faithful.” As for Podhoretz himself, he has grown so intolerant of criticism and dissent, so terrified of impending doom at the hands of militant Muslims, and so furious with his fellow Jews that his intemperate rantings are dismissed by all but his neoconservative progeny. The Brownsville wunderkind has ended up an embittered, paranoid crank, standing by and for himself alone.

        “America would be a much different place if the Mayflower had sunk in the North Atlantic or the Wampanoag had done the right thing and slaughtered the Pilgrims.”Have to disagree strongly. North America had been subject to English colonization for a hundred years by 1620. Another ship, and then another would have surely followed. The Pilgrim Mayflower was certainly not unique, except maybe in their stupidity in initially adopting socialism as their way of life. By doing so, they made themselves extremely weak and could have been eliminated by the natives at their leisure. Thing is, the natives wanted the strange foreigners as allies in their fights against other native tribes.Indeed, if it wasn’t for the European colonists’ interventions, those natives remaining after the unintentional pandemic brought about by incidental contact with European diseases, would likely have killed each other off, while the colonists struggled to survive.
