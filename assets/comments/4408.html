        I have no sympathy for the mobs, but it does seem a bit much to assume the cops innocent when spinal cords are broken on a man in custody &amp; in cuffs. As a kid long, long ago raised in a well off white hood we kinda of thought of the police as big brothers &amp; I have funny tales to tell of my group being caught &amp; street punished without arrest or notification of parents. My biggest grief was when they caught us parking they shined their flashlights way too long on our gf’s, especially those undressed, and even there I understood if not forgave them cuz our teen girls were really cute.I’ve a 30 yr old son also raised in the well off white hood, same hood, &amp; when I told them my stories, they had none similar to tell and said the cops have changed and none liked them nor trusted them and some of these young men, better behaved than my crew have been roughly treated and sprayed.

            That’s what everyone expects. It will be a silent strike. The cops will go back into their barracks and let the natives run wild.

        You left out the part where she admitted that her opinion was formed by the mob.  “To the people of Baltimore and the demonstrators across America, I heard your call for ‘No Justice, No Peace,’ your peace is sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man,” Mosby added.
