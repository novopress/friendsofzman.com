        Hey Z, Your commentary is great, but I REALLY love the AfterShokz ear speakers you recommended recently. I finally found a wireless set I can actually use. Thanks!

            Thank you for that as well.
They are not completely ignoring it. Those fans are supporting this mess. If a few more million would cut the cord (the money) flowing to these entities it would have an actual impact. I heard the commercials on radio, see them on TV. I now listen to my music list and no TV.
Also vote democrat to kick the rino asses to the street because of more of this.

        If you‚Äôre interested in the ‚Äúunreported truths‚Äù of the Covid pandemic, in particular, information that powers that be wish you did not know, may I plug Alex Berenson?https://alexberenson.substack.com/archive?utm_source=menu-dropdownHe may not be a world-class author, but he has several books to his name. He was a writer at NYT for over a decade. Recently was permantly banned from Twitter for his covid ‚Äúmisinformation.‚Äù He may indeed be a lie-spreading crank, but a solid professional background distinguishes him from the average raving lunatic on the internet.This last is what brought him to my attention.In my opinion, his web site is rather lame. But his two booklets on the pandemic (available on Amazon and elsewhere, modest cost) are quite informative. Between them, they only require an hour or two of reading. I consider myself a minor expert on Covid, as I spend several hours a day on the Web reading about it and related topics. Even for me there was some new information in his booklets.

        ‚ÄúHorse faced barmaid.‚Äù Z, I really gotta give you credit. Sometimes you come up with the best phrases. That‚Äôs what keeps us coming back, many of us paying customers! üòÄI hope the tone of today‚Äôs essay proves true. The gist I get is that the public is tired of the charade and is trying to return to normal life and just ignoring the RPG that our government and institutions have increasingly become.A lingering doubt however; the uninvited guest, the attention-seeker, is not out of tricks yet. She still has access to the levers of power and can use them in various desperate, idiotic, perhaps very damaging ways.

        Looks like Faux News‚Äôs Based Black Man Larry Elder just went down in flames. A lot of people who watch that junk are probably in shock right now, I mean how could he lose with all that Candace Owens support? Aren‚Äôt blacks patriotic heroes who luv ‚ÄòMurica and are raring to get off that ‚Äòol democrat plantation and pull themselves up by the bootstraps? Lol. Total losers. Watch them nominate Tim Scott in 2024 on a platform of DR3 only to have him lose in a landslide, getting only 8% of the black vote. GOP clowns: ‚ÄúAny day now. Just one more based black criticizing CRT and waving the ‚ÄòMurican flag on Faux News will do it.‚ÄùPS. Larry Elder was a front man to control the White republican base by making him their spokesman. It‚Äôs been common for decades to quell White identity by appointing non-Whites as their leaders. But the era of republican electability is coming to an end with demographic change, so that tactic is about to start failing along with it. The same is being done with Ben Shapiro over these vaccine mandates. They are promoting him as the leader of the mandate resistance so that he can later lose in court and then say to republicans ‚ÄúWell, we tried. It‚Äôs time to give it up and accept the mandate. And as your leader, you should follow my example.‚Äù It‚Äôs pretty clear what‚Äôs going on with that.

            Exactly correct on the analogy of Ben Shapiro‚Äôs lawsuit.  Immediately after the obvious theft of Trump‚Äôs landslide election victory Ben explained that maybe a few hundred illegitimate votes might be exposed, but not enough to change the results.  I knew at that moment he is a shill for the globalists.  His lawsuit is theater and will play out as you have described.

        I‚Äôm reading a book right now that deals with the USSR. According to this book, The night Stalin died, he retired to his bedroom and didn‚Äôt come out in the morning. Everyone around him were so terrified to wake him up that no one dared knocking on his door. Turned out he had a stroke and probably couldn‚Äôt respond . When someone finally got the guts to open the door the next evening ,it was too late. If only we were so lucky. Stay tuned. You never know.

        No those TV ads are not simply forgotten the next day. The power of the modern media to brainwash cannot be understated and it‚Äôs self-evident.
And to mention anti-White propaganda without mentioning the Small Hats behind it is just cowardly and pathetic. At what point do you mention them?
That‚Äôs how grifters roll though. Don‚Äôt want to say anything that might disrupt the cash flow.

        I‚Äôm in a dour mood, so I want to repeat a funny 3g4me was kind enough to post yesterday.
3g4me: ‚ÄúEnd White privilege; eat moar crickets.‚Äù
Hahaha! Selma Hayek did just that on a women‚Äôs talk show.
Fried crickets were a childhood treat in her home village. She said, ‚Äúmy mouth is watering so much, I‚Äôm losing my English‚Äù!
PS- let‚Äôs make AOC a cricket sandwich and see how she reacts.

            The Power Structure is militantly opposed to all Kovid treatments/preventatives except the ones that are the most dubious, the least effective, and potentially the most harmful: Moron Masks and the stab. The fact that they are militantly promoting these things and vilifying every alternative is reason to doubt the decency of their motives.

                You missed the most important trait of the approved treatments: they are on-patent, high-cost and for the business, therefore high-profit. If they can be brought to market under the emergency use authorization, which requires that no existing treatment be available (or, perhaps, to suppress the use of any such potential competitors), lower bar for safety and efficacy (in fact, it doesn‚Äôt have to be proven useful, just that it MIGHT be!) and most importantly, a total immunity to liability if and when things go wrong.

        Despite the fact that the government has no moral authority, it still does have authority, which means the ability to ruin many lives, even over stupid meaningless things.  People get lost in the technicalities of the vaccine, does it work or not, etc.  The larger issue is, if a government can mandate that you put a drug in your body, which is your most sacred private property, then it‚Äôs not a stretch for them to actually take your private property tomorrow.  What they‚Äôre saying is ‚Äúall property is communal, including YOU.‚Äù  Of course Marxism is the logical endpoint of liberal democracy.  It‚Äôs a cope to say that you can just tune out and go about your life.  It‚Äôs a life that‚Äôs YOURS to live, not some ghoul in DC or Sacramento or Albany making your personal decisions.As a side note, thank you so much, Fox News and National GOP for making Larry Elder (some has been OJ Simpson of talk radio) front and center in the CA recall election.  The polls reversed as soon as you did that and now ass-clown will likely survive.  Once again the ‚Äúgood Conservatives‚Äù have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.  But you had to have your magic negro didn‚Äôt you.  But at least you felt good supporting him.  You‚Äôre not ‚Äúthe real racists.‚Äù

            Whose idea was it to use a black man to appeal to a Hispanic demographic on edge and disgruntled with the democrats over Black Lives Matter? Nearly the entirety of GOP gains among the Hispanic demographic in the last election came from BLM backlash, so these imbeciles in the republican party and Faux News sailed against the wind on that by nominating an unknown black guy? SMH. The GOP is worthless, and so are its voters and sycophants. This recall only serves to further strengthen my commitment to never vote for republicans again, as if voting even matters now.

        Sorry Z, I take issue with everything you wrote:A. AOC is not just a dumb barmaid, she comes from a powerful/rich family with ties to the Puerto Rican establishment. Its why she was chosen. She has a network which White people lack ‚Äî that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs destined to rule as President Qween.B. President Psaki (who is apparently the real President and tells Biden what to do and say and policies to push) is part of the Covid panic ‚Äî OSHA will be forcing employers to jab or fire everyone and the enforcement will be rigorous.C. Employers will comply, enthusiastically, as the new tax rates sure to go into effect will hit them hard ‚Äî so they need massive shortages and inflation and firing half their workforce (conveniently) and replacing them with H1-Bs and illegals both exempt and far cheaper is their play. Punish President Psaki for raising taxes and make money while they can.D. The F- Joe Biden signs and chants are a visible protest by White men against Senile Bane and his President. As are the chants for Trump at WWE events, other places, etc. This is dangerous for the Regency as it lets others know that Senile Bane is despised. [Masks make people look like creepy villains].E. Cost of everything is spiraling and the corporate strategy to make it worse by worker shortages will make it get far worse. No time for a Soviet Cope; rather imminent bread riots.F. The true believer crazies run the Regency. President Psaki will not be pleased with your non compliance. As she had Senile Bane say, ‚Äúour patience is run thin‚Äù and other villain type stuff offered by movie villains. The next step is a vibrant, culturally enriching ‚ÄúVaccine Corps‚Äù where federal officers from the hood kick down your door, maybe vax you by force, and take your stuff. That‚Äôs the true believer desire, correct? Part of the Great Reset and Build Back Better. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll own nothing, have no privacy. And we will crush you daily.‚Äù

            There isn‚Äôt one person behind the scenes controlling everything in the Biden White House, but the idea that the most powerful person is an airhead like Jen Psaki is laughable.  Ron Klain is believed to have the most power of the behind the scenes players.

They‚Äôre doing a reboot of the 80‚Äôs show The Wonder Years but with a black boy.Totally fine with them making a show about a black boy‚Äôs experiences in the late 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù aspect of it ‚Äì making a reboot where the character is directly replaced. The same thing as when they replaced (permanently) ‚ÄúJake‚Äù the white guy in the State Farm commercials with a black ‚ÄúJake.‚Äù If they had simply called him ‚ÄúTyrone‚Äù ‚Äì well no big deal, just their new spokesman.Black Captain America, etc.

                They also replaced Magnum‚Äôs Tom Selleck with Jay Hernandez.  I was actually okay with Denzel Washington in the movie version of the Equalizer because they kept the theme that he was a down-and-out lone wolf.  The Latifa version, besides the fact that she is horrible, has a whole crew of experts, which is simply a different show.

                    Yes, but the Denzel Equalizer was simply a bad movie because none of the bad guys were any threat whatsoever.
He was able to dispatch them so easily, sometimes literally with one hand.  If the bad guys are utterly pathetic and useless, there is no danger and thus no tension.

        &gt;Short of doing a Ted Kaczynski and relocating to a cabin in the wilderness, there is no escape from the reign of media terror. No physical escape, at least.

        Every once in a while someone utters a discouraging word in the earshot of a minority,How are minorities determined anyway? It must be through the populations within geographical lines of borders, wouldn‚Äôt you say? In the US there are many geographical units where what are generally considered to be minorities are, in fact, majorities, Washington, D.C., for instance, or Philadelphia or Watts. A white face in East St. Louis or Brooklyn, Illinois is very unusual. The farther the demographic borders are extended, the more minorities turn into majorities. The population of Africa is many times that of North America. In no real sense can blacks be considered minorities except in localized circumstances. And in the fact of increasing economic globalization, they have become a majority in an ever-expanding social environment.

The better question is how professional victims are determined. That‚Äôs all that ‚Äúminority‚Äù means these days.

        I am not sure that ignoring everything or being indifferent is a good strategy. It could backfire big time.  Perhaps government policy is to keep the sheep frightened out of their tiny minds and the non-sheep can be left to their passivity while the government puts in place ever more authoritarian policies?

            The Johnson junta after a collapse in their poll ratings took vaccine passports off the table in England*. Less than 36 hours later they were back on the table as plan B.This flip-floping and assuring the public one day that you aren‚Äôt going to do X and then doing it shortly afterwards is a deliberate and calculated plan to constantly keep the public in a state of fear and confusion.
*Vaccine passports are still going full steam ahead in Scotland and Wales.

                In the long run, it‚Äôs a massive own-goal. Yeah yeah, I know, in the long run we‚Äôre all dead, but we‚Äôve been here before, y‚Äôall. Twice, actually ‚Äî first Prohibition, then the War on Drugs.Laws that can‚Äôt be enforced are far, far worse than no laws at all, because the government that can‚Äôt enforce its own laws looks feckless, stupid, and incompetent. Not only that, you‚Äôve made an actually somewhat disreputable private leisure activity into a public protest ‚Äî per capita alcohol consumption actually went UP during Prohibition, because now just having a drink made you into some kind of rebel. As for the War on Drugs, how‚Äôs that working out? I must be the only White man in America who doesn‚Äôt know how to get enough oxyc*nt!n to drop a horse, but even I could get a nickel bag within 20 minutes of pulling up to any town with a stoplight from sea to shining sea.If you really want to drive home to Joe Normie that he lives in an anarcho-tyranny, in other words, go with mask mandates.

                    Echoing your last point, they don‚Äôt have to enforce the laws against everyone.  Just selectively, like against the Jan 6 trespassers.

        Proof of concept: Forget ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù mandates, what about social media mandates?In my way, I‚Äôve been almost as bad as the covidiots in my family about dropping out of social media. I‚Äôm not going to flat out declare that getting the f*ck off Twitter, Faceborg, etc. will solveallyour problems‚Ä¶ but I will heavily imply it, no doubt long past the point where friends and family start avoiding me.* The point is, if more people really do start dropping off social media like they should, perhaps THE primary poz nozzle is closed. And more peoplewillbe getting off social media, if only because the Hive has decided that they will perma-ban anything that isn‚Äôt 100% goodthink at all times.Given all that, one would expect to see social media mandates coming down from Tubman DF. Have you made your five posts in praise of Dear Leader today, comrade? Have you done your ten mandatory retweets and upvotes?As this is increasingly the only way these people have to get attention, that attention will soon be made mandatory.*n.b. to spergs: I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm proffering this advice on the internet. That probably seems ironic, if you are Alanis Morrisette. In reality, it is what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúnuance.‚Äù It‚Äôs only ironic or self-contradictory if you think the advice ‚Äúa glass of wine at bedtime is probably good for your heart‚Äù entails ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you get get gutter-puking drunk on sangria every night.‚Äù

            Absolutely drop out of social media as quickly as possible. I logged out about three years ago but left my accounts intact, untended and never viewed. It has confused the hell out of people. I get breathless email reminders my account exists and Mary Jo wants to share pictures with me or whatever. It‚Äôs plain they want us telling our business to the world. I can understand those who have to use social media for business reasons, but at some point word of mouth suffices for most professionals and even small stores.I do not know if use will become mandatory, but non-use likely is noticed already.

                As I not very politely noted yesterday, They are probably more interested in our use of alternative media, such as what we are doing right here. In this phase, we have relative freedom of speech but not of privacy. The tyranny would not be highly effective unless nearly all dissent could be snuffed out. In internet times, that would require de-registering the Zman or anyone else unapproved from having a domain name registered, losing all banking services, and so forth. Yes, the banning has already been occurring, but mostly via ‚Äúprivate‚Äù entities. Curious exceptions exist, like the Federal ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù list, which must be in a legal grey area but there it is‚Ä¶just as Nick Fuentes.

            My non-self-employed non-leftist peers have to maintain fake shitlib Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. accounts so they‚Äôll be allowed to have careers.

            While your speculaiton about mandatory participation is ludicrous now, history says it‚Äôs not. Probably from a Solzhenisyn book: In early Soviet times, probably Stalin era since it was the worst, the public literally was required to listen to radio propaganda broadcasts. Failing to listen had dire consequences. Of course, everything had dire consequences back then, whether it was listening to a foreign broadcast or stealing a potato from the communal farm. üôÅ

            When I was a little girl, 10 or so, my best friend and I would play the cancer game. We would run around and point all the things that give you cancer, trees and rocks and whatnot and then run away from them and laugh and laugh and laugh. It was the 70‚Äôs. Cancer porn was big and we though it was stupid. I don‚Äôt think we were unique then or now.

                Reading this makes me almost glad that I grew up in a communist country. We only played hide&amp;seek or went on bike rides and while there was a lot of propaganda everywhere, we mostly ignored it. The occasional military exercise we had to attend was more fun than scary, even though we (as kids) had to learn how to treat chemical weapon injuries, had to shoot some airguns or practice running into a bomb shelter. No ridiculous hiding under the desk ‚Äì that‚Äôs an American specialty.

                Yeah, I was a kid in the 70s. I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about.  Then, later in the 80s, nuclear war was gonna happen any day now. Don‚Äôt forget AIDS. We were all gonna die of AIDS too.Of all the propaganda I got, funny enough it was the aids that I bought into.  Everyone acted as if it was inevitable.  We got a lot of race propaganda, but that absolutely did not work on anyone I ever knew.  We were around them way too much to be fooled. People mouthed it, but the second we were without any blacks around‚Ä¶. Also, once you walked out of the classroom, all the whites just happened to walk together and all the blacks and Puerto Ricans all walked each among themselves.

        It was not surprising to see football stadiums full of maskless fans, but when I watched the U.S. Open tennis final on Sunday, a very low percentage of the crowd were wearing masks.  This event tends to attract wealthy New York elite and I thought a higher percentage of them might want to virtue signal on camera at least that they are loyal to the Covid cult.  These people are open hypocrites, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting widespread mask wearing, but thought it might closer to 10%, instead it looked like less than 1%.  One of the few members of the crowd shown wearing a mask was has been actor Leonardo DiCaprio.  That did make me curious, is he a moronic true believer?  Concerned he would get fired from some upcoming role for not wearing one?  Who knows.

            B125:  Yes, same as always.  The majority of Whites want to return to grillin‚Äô and chillin‚Äô and cheering on their kneegrow sportsball players while eating Cheetos.  This depresses me no end.And as for masks, here in the DFW ‚Äòburbs they are everywhere.  While most stores have the signs saying masks are ‚Äòencouraged,‚Äô Krogers still retains the ones saying they‚Äôre ‚Äòrequired.‚Äô  I don‚Äôt wear one and haven‚Äôt been challenged, but more than half the shoppers do.  And one of my husband‚Äôs colleagues has to isolate at home for 2 weeks because someone in his daughter‚Äôs kindergarten class had the sniffles.Sometimes I think Zman doesn‚Äôt get out of Lagos enough.  And when he begins his Sunday podcasts talking about the hint of fall in the air, while we swelter here in 95 degree weather, he‚Äôs just rubbing it in.

                same here, half the people in Wegmans are masked up. Also in rural gas stations, which is extra depressing‚Ä¶.
I think this is the real bad sign. Normal people wearing these masks for years on end. It shows a degradation in the spirit of a people to be this subservient and docile

                In my area, south of a major metro, we see very few masks.  Home depot and Safeway employees wear masks, but maybe 1 of 50 or 1 of 100 customers do.  Ive seen 2-3 ‚Äúmasks alone in a car,‚Äù but thousands without the muzzle.Yet somehow my state is ‚Äúblue‚Äù and yalls are ‚Äúred.‚Äù  Huh.

At the university where I work, no more than 15% of students wear the idiotic things, but the faculty all wear them.

            Principles exist outside of personal consumption and leisure, remote from the bankruptcy of bread and circuses. There will be a time when the arbiters of ones ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù have a reckoning with their natural roots. Still a lot of runway in front of that cliff it seems.Our people have become trapped in a financialized, bland culture of consumption. The clown world economics that encompass almost everything render escape into intermittent bouts of cogdis numbed by bud light and doritos ‚Äì or IPA and grassfed burgers on gluten free buns for the more successful types.A pharma sales rep reaps aplenty whilst complaining of gov‚Äôt crony instituted bizdev aka ‚Äúvaccine mandates‚Äù. Then drives her $120k sprinter van into the mountains to hang out with dirt people because she must work from ‚Äúhome‚Äù and hates how the city gives her badfeelz. Hubby streams football with his boy watching the hate propaganda as if it is some other white kid they want enslaved in self-hatred and guilt. Oh how the dream of a return to normal.

            It depends on the company. Both in terms of how committed they are to cult and how difficult it will be for them to maintain adequate staffing levels if they rigorously enforce a vaccine mandate.  Many of the hospitals don‚Äôt seem to care about staffing, yesterday there was an article about a hospital in New York state that is going to stop delivering babies because of staffing shortages.  Nurses who work in these units seem particularly resistance to getting the vaccine.

                        L&amp;D is tricky.  No one sues faster and harder than a parent with a damaged baby.  The E&amp;O risk is off the charts.  There is also a tight market, they actually pitch to expecting parents.  The birth center we started at closed down to insufficient business.  It is a ‚Äúbuyers market‚Äù as it were, and the L&amp;D nursing staff ends up being whiter than northern Maine, all mothers themselves, and all experienced (I‚Äôve been in 5 different L&amp;D departments in the last 3 years, plus misc providers).  Then there is COLA, the hospitals out in the burbs with the white mmc/umc ppl with the health insurance to use their facilities are, well, in nice white expensive areas that arent condusive to imported help.

                As a healthcare provider I can report that in my area various hospitals have deployed different strategies. One large hospital mandated the vaccine for its employees, many of them quit. The rub is there is already a shortage of staffing at hospitals so it rubs both ways: As a medical professional you can leave your hospital that mandates a vaccine and go 1.5 hours away to another hospital that wont mandate a vaccine and probably get a 10k signing bonus as well.There is always a war between hospitals to retain and recruit staff. Any hospital that mandates a vaccine will immediately lose employees rather than gain them. There are far to many of my colleagues that recognize the truth: Covid is a strong flu that is only potentially deadly to those already at risk with weakened and comprised health.There was the other idea that if you don‚Äôt want the vaccine then you would be subjected to weekly testing. Many of us in the healthcare profession laughed. If 80 million people are steadfast in not getting the vaccine then they would be more than happy to do the weekly testing‚Ä¶.this places an INORDINATE amount of strain on employers to hire testers weekly, pay for said testing, not to mention that having an additional 80 million or so tests needing processing in labs would properly overrun their staff and place overall lab functions to a screeching halt.If Americans wanted to put an end to this shit then I say continue rejecting the vaccine, place the responsibility of weekly testing on employers, endure the tests, and watch the system strain to the point of capitulation.

                    If OSHA is made to write the law mandating this, I would assume the vexx/test becomes a required PPE and thus the responsibility of the employers to provide on their dime.

        Yes, coping with the crazy is indeed mostly about ignoring the insanity because life goes on and there are better things to do with one‚Äôs time. And eventually the advertising industry is going to learn that the people with money to spend are not paying any attention to their commercials anymore. Everyone is secretly hoping that Tater Joe will either die outright or his Alzheimer‚Äôs will keep him permanently in the closet.But this psychological lull is but a holding pattern, and the rot continues nonetheless. People need a break from being perpetually angry, and that means more time on the couch watching football and opening another bag of chips (add in a few beers &amp; burgers and it‚Äôs the Good Life all over again). Just don‚Äôt go near the bathroom scale and you can pretend that muddle-through works every time.

            I upvoted you but would suggest that advertisers are in fact targeting the audiences they want. Blacks and females, while not having the most money are the ones in fact who are easily separated from their money.Madison avenue projects an image of what you should be, and as you know, injects their products into that image, thus: buy our product and be what we are projecting into your head. This is why blacks have shit priorities in their lives and females spend absurd amounts of money on beauty products, clothing and home decorations.  All blacks want to be rappers and ball players, all females want to be sexy Martha Stewarts. Madison Avenue is more than happy to sell that image, blacks and females will trip over each other giving them money for that projected identity.

            Why?It‚Äôs definitely happening with my family, at least for my part. I have been unable to let go of the resentment I have for my parents who are okay with all this. After last week‚Äôs speech from Joe it‚Äôs clear nothing will shake them out of their allegiance to the evil empire. My mom told me a few weeks ago that I was putting children in danger, meanwhile she‚Äôs all for masking and vaxxing the little ones. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to call my dad on his birthday and sent a terse email instead. I know it‚Äôs petty and I should do better but the fact is I won‚Äôt even be able to visit them while this is going on because even if they could get over the vaxx thing they‚Äôd still insist I do all the mask craziness while I‚Äôm there and my brother‚Äôs wife would probably insist I can‚Äôt see her stepchildren. They may all be libtarded twats but I come from good people and it‚Äôs a shame to lose them.Last night I had the dark thought that likely every branch and leaf of both sides of my family is vaxxed. If this turns out worse case my entire line now rests on my childless, middle aged shoulders.

                Astralturf:  Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself.  Your mother‚Äôs comment demonstrates she cares more for her public piety than her own son‚Äôs physical and mental health.  While I wholeheartedly believe in the importance of family, I am also the first to recognize that all people are imperfect, and some are so heavily flawed as to be intolerable.  I have had minimal contact with my birth family for years, by choice and design.While I try to feel Christian charity towards them, they make it extraordinarily difficult.  I went out and bought some very simple, anodyne ‚Äúthinking of you‚Äù cards that I merely sign and send to my mother periodically.  This makes it easy to avoid any mention of politics or family or vaccines.  Why invite unnecessary conflict and angst into your life?  The concept of ‚Äòhonoring‚Äô as used in the Bible is not the same as today‚Äôs definition of ‚Äòlove.‚Äô  Keep your distance and demonstrate courtesy, and hold your head high.

        i noticed the local news is back to full on panic mode, re: coof.   i turned the channel before learning what the new lie is.   what struck me is how obvious the grift is now, with the coof porn; it‚Äôs definitely losing its kick and so the dose has to be increased.  but that‚Äôs a losing battle, every time.  in my experience, this kind of phenomena follows an asymptotic curve, and in this instance, the process has just about reached its zero point (where there is no further response regardless of the dose).also have noticed the the race mixing anti white commercials have toned down for some reason, although the double plus helping of nigs on tv continues unabated.the sign, the real signal, that something big is happening, is if government officials and prominent people start getting assasinated in unhidable numbers.  not by us, but as a result of internecine fighting amongst the ‚Äúelite‚Äù.in the end, the US will break up into several regions, and the mud people kingdoms will collapse into subsistence economy (with the concomitant die off).   will try not to laugh as all those traitorous gov employees find out their wickedness has destroyed the basis for their precious pensions.

The Muslims are heretics, but they get women right. I break Tolstoy‚Äôs laws of history when I talk about ‚Äúcauses‚Äù but I can‚Äôt imagine a more direct cause of all our problems than giving women a voice and equality with their husbands‚Ä¶.

            A new new lie? You mean not the stuff about the Delta variant killing us all? You do paint a nice picture of the whole nasty society tying up its own loose ends though. I can imagine the starving muds feasting on that sweet tender never-worked-a-real-job government long pig while Gavin Newsome strangles Kate Brown with her own intestines before Nancy Pelosi shoots him with her AK-47. Finally Greta Thunberg, wearing a bomb vest, rushes up to her and takes her to Allah with her.Sadly, though our elites may be suicidal they also want to take us all with them and won‚Äôt be content to destroy each other for us.

            To me, one of the scariest subtexts of the entire pandemic is the fanatical, almost religious crusade to push to vaccinate everybody. Yes, a lot of it can be attributed to corporate greed (Big Pharma, Big Medicine) as well as power-seeking or maintaining the (illusory?) control thereof by corporate and government actors at all levels. But there does seem to be more in play than is explained by those. The relentless censorship of any and all dissenting views, never mind that some of them are (‚Äúwere‚Äù) respected scientists, authors, academics or other professionals. Pay no heed to reports of adverse side effects or less-than-promised results of the jabs. As each day rolls by, the vaccination effort and increasing calls for or attempts at government control, seem to me more like a witch hunt or a Crusade, than any public health effort worthy of the name. At the personal level, we‚Äôve already described what are some of its worst effects: the polarization and alienation in society including one‚Äôs own family relations.I fear that things may continue to worsen. From most of what I‚Äôve read about the pandemic, and I‚Äôve read a lot, two things stand out: masking is all but useless unless one uses ‚Äúreal‚Äù (N95 or better) masking; the vaccines have many adverse side effects which are under-reported and their efficacy and duration are both quite less than promised. Oh, and the bonus: being fully vaccinated neither protects you from catching the virus nor from spreading it. At best, you get some protection from serious illness, for a few months maybe. The coming six months (winter) are going to force a lot of bad news to the fore, that I don‚Äôt think even the bought MSM will be able to bury. üôÅ

        Spot on. When I point out the United States is breaking apart already, it is on the individual level as much as the state and local level. As Havel told the Czechs, live as if you are free. Another version was to tune out and drop off.The Ruling Class is viewed as buffoons but what will take it out is being ignored. As someone below pointed out, our Latin American replacements already view the law as a suggestion. That is spreading to the larger populfirst. If 9/11 happened today, by way of example, most Americans either would find it entertaining or ignore it completely.As much as the State would like to gin up a civil war, outside of the Antifa-style fanatics, most people don‚Äôt even care. It won‚Äôt end well for our betters although they certainly intend and will put us thru hell first. That probably will be noticed.

            Informal parallel structures are getting more formidable, especially among minorities.  Whites are slowly but surely catching up, as they are still in the ‚Äòlaughing in the inside but complying‚Äô phase right now.  Once they make the transition to completely ignoring D.C., it‚Äôs going to get fun.You‚Äôre already seeing this in rural areas, where it seemed to be a different country for a while during peak Covid madness.The employee mandate was a complete miss, as the mandate is completely unenforcable, galvanizes a more radical portion of the country, and brings resentment directly at Washington instead of focusing it on their fellow citizens.

                Yes, exactly. The informal parallel structures probably have as much influence, and possibly more, as D.C. in many if not most areas of public life at this point (as, in theory, they should although that has not been the case for years). I live in an exurb and actually witnessed urban people come into my neck of the woods to shop and dine because mask requirements never were enforced and in some cases even unknown.One of the unintended consequences of the mask and vaccine mandates along with the lockdowns has been the rise of informal parallel structures. I keep expecting a huge crackdown on cryptocurrency for this very reason, although that will lead to more barter, to cite an analogous phenomenon. While we as Whites decry the atomization of our people, in some ways it has benefits, not the least of which is the ability to live outside the Borg to some extent.

                    Your comment parallels a phenomenon I witnessed when I was a teen in the Northern VA suburbs back around 1979 during the second ‚Äúenergy crisis‚Äù and spot gas shortages. For a time, gas lines and informal rationing were features in the closer in suburbs. My then-best friend‚Äôs Dad just took a short drive west to then mostly-rural Manassas and he had no trouble filling up right off the I-66 exit. üôÇ
Forty years later, you‚Äôd probably have to drive way into West-by-God to find a similar contrast, the exurbs have grown (‚Äúmetastatized‚Äù might be more apt) so much.

        Sandy Cortez got attention because she‚Äôs kinda cute, has nice tits, and a bubbly personality that come across well on TV
IOW she‚Äôs a mid level actress ‚Äì celebrity.   In more ways than one, as she actually auditioned for the role she been playing with a yank Ughers group.
Her act will get old and age will be unkind to her appearance as happens to all sweet young things in Hollywood. Her showing up i that dress means she‚Äôs probably already past her celebrity half-life.

        The information monopoly is being used to create feelings of fear, insecurity, confusion, and anxiety. Why? So that we will seek relief and accept our loss of freedom, and welcome with open arms, a totalitarian government with a salve, a soma pill, that will take away all our pain. Big government, small citizen. Citizen? How quaint. Inhabitants more like it.

            The weird part is that it‚Äôs not from an information monopoly though.
The driving force is social media, where people ramp each up  other‚Äôs fear for a little attention.
The pols are definitely jumping onboard and power tripping, but they didn‚Äôt coordinate it.
The reality is that a large number of people,  maybe  a majority don‚Äôt want freedom.  They want attention and direction.

                i truly believe there are several castes (in the biological sense) that humans fall into (i.e. are born as) and the largest numerically is as slaves.  that‚Äôs right, a real majority of humans actively want to be slaves.  and this is why democracy can never work.

                    An idea that‚Äôs been percolating around my mind for a while is that civilization itself is infantilizing.Something about urban living and a high degree of division of labor delays the maturity of human beings.  Maybe genetically and not just culturally.  Which is what drives the collapse-regeneration cycle of civilizations.   The average maturity level of our culture is definitely regressing ‚Äì and has been for generations.  The baby boomers were basically adolescents that never grew up (yeah not all of them); permanently obsessed with rebellion against authority and personal gratification.  The current generation is one of pre-pubescent children afraid of the bogey man and craving parental protection and guidance.

                        Each generation likely breaks down along such lines; some actually arse themselves to attain and maintain agency, while a far greater number do nothing of the kind, at best contenting themselves to LARP at being ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù.As the authoritatian, centralized state has waxed in its powers, the LARPers, being fundamentally feckless, are easily cowed, some through fear of being deprived of access to material and social goods, while younger generations are increasingly boxed out of access through mass immigration, affirmative action, and the accumulating effects of enemy action by the little hats, while some have also been medically castrated through Ritalin and the like.Boomers such as me had more scope earlier on, partly by dint of numbers, but those who were ever and only LARPing at possessing agency, are also being brought to heel by engineered means , means which act in concert with their already submissive natures.So, yeah, servile by preference or genetic predisposition seems to be the best explanation.

        The mere fact that sports all is in full swing again is a great example of why we always end up losing. The deranged people on the other side of the divide never tire of trying to destroy us and the culture. Our side just wants to have fun.Trump understood this. He realized if he was entertaining enough he wouldn‚Äôt really need to do much and could even repeatedly throw his supporters under the clown bus.This is also why our side of the divide needs to quit having these illusions that at any moment the other side will simply push us too far and we are going to rebel. Sports ball teams, players, announcers and advertisers love to tell the fans how much they hate them. Doesn‚Äôt really matter. Party time. Let the game begin

                What an interesting analogy. Much like the regular here who‚Äôs always using the ‚Äúantibodies‚Äù metaphor for solving problems. Tyrannies die by an autoimmune disease? Perhaps. Alas, they may take the rest of the body with them.There is an interesting parallel with the we-want-them-to-be-universal COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccines.‚Äù  There is some evidence that many of the serious side effects are auto-immune reactions, not only to the spike protein (intended), but also to other ingredients in the jab. Of course, you‚Äôll learn none of this in the mass media. And for various reasons, to include ‚ÄúDo you want to keep your job, your funding, etc.‚Äù you won‚Äôt see it explored too seriously by the medical community.As I sort-of explained in an earlier post, while it‚Äôs not certain, imagine what happens to the image of The Establsiihment if and when failings, deaths and other issues with the vaccines become too big for even the controlled media to hide? They might just throw in the towel, admit ‚ÄúSorry, we screwed up.‚Äù and let freedom reign. Sadly, I suspect that‚Äôs not a likely outcome.

            This is correct. While it may seem like a black pill, I think the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 rule) provides some hope. All power struggles can be seen as struggles between the elites of various groups. Democracy has clouded us to that reality. We have to see ourselves as the elites of our own group who are looking for any way we can to get our people to fight for their survival (which is our priority right now as a defeated people).

                It is a tough situation. Without leaders the masses won‚Äôt mobilize in any effective way. Jan 6 showed that ruling and managerial classes will use any genuine mass protesr to their advantage and the disadvantage of us.
If you try to be a leader you will be singled out and persecuted but maybe be given an opportunity to be an FBI informant.
Probably the rational thing to do in light of all that is live in a relatively safe area from globohomo, build a strong community, and enlighten people around you offline

        One reason people are not in the streets demanding an end of this stuff is they have found a better solution. They just ignore it.Yep,  I predicted that outcome when this begin in March 2020.I‚Äôm actually quite surprised that it‚Äôs taken this long to reach that point.Which to me, means that America‚Äôs legacy culture is more persistent that I had thought.  I‚Äôm in SoCal, which is in the vanguard of America‚Äôs latinization.  So ignoring the law, as happens down south,  was always the obvious end point.One of the ways that America‚Äôs cloud people are morons is that for all their talk of multi culturalism really think that all cultures are the same.  By which I mean identical not morally equivalent.   They are completely oblivious to the reality that the culture of the immigrants they were importing included things like seeing laws as optional; and the government as an enemy to be subverted.

            For the people in charge it was all about drowning Whitey in a sea of diversity.  I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve given it a lot of thought about the behavior of the new population, and what the tradeoffs will be.

                    Eventually whitey will have to formally ally with the latinx and drive off the Indians, Chinese, Arabs, and Africans. ADOS can have some good southern lands. At least our dusky bean eating brethren belong on this continent, even if many of them are far too north. If we cut off forced social welfare for people too lazy or stupid too work and establish strict crime laws many of them will naturally migrate back where life is easier for them. Even if many stay we‚Äôll end up with an emergent caste system like is in every latin country. The key to our success will be having a non democratic for, of government so that we can avoid the graft and corruption of the southern regions and we must keep English as our language for aesthetic reasons.

                        Retention of English as the language is for more than aesthetic reasons: the foundational governmental and social forms come from our people, and should continue to form the basis of these underpinings of the civilization; also, this is the language of science and technology, and its absolute dominance is indispensable to making that clear.
There must needs be a clear hierarchical status system. Anything else is looking for trouble.

        This is also reflected on the major newspaper websites. NYT, WaPo and others scream out headlines blaring as if the news reported for that day is the Most. Important. Ever.
Like George W. Bush (Shrub) getting attention a few days ago for comparing disgruntled citizens to ISIS 2.0. The same media who was calling him the US version of Hitler in the past now expects us to believe he is some wise elder statesman?

I did think that that this year when the theme of the show, that last year was changed from ‚Äúyay us‚Äù to ‚Äúeat shit‚Äîyes *you* personally‚Äù for BLM, had *stayed* that way, absent violent coercion, normies would realize that the acidic normie-hatred spraying out of every hole of sports isn‚Äôt ‚Äúvirtue signaling‚Äù but the very soul of the enterprise.

                as the boomers continue to die off, the ratings will continue to contract.   the nba is already a non-profitable league; they will die once china assrapes them by creating their own league.  just ask disney how that works.
as far as i can tell, from my kids, and their friends (all millenials) none of them are into any american sports; a few like european soccer.
college sports are pozzed, too, but a lot of people are willing to overlook that to have something to share communally.  the nigs are in the process of putting paid to that quaint notion.

                    At my former university, the only joggers I see are playing school sports, such as basketball and football.  It‚Äôs really quite boring (and inane) to watch a team of low life‚Äôs that I have nothing in common with, and who are not even students in any meaningful sense.A couple of decades ago when I was still paying attention, the local paper looked up the records of the highly rated basketball teams of prior years and found only a 5% graduation rate in five years.  Our beloved basketball coach got a hissy fit and threatened to leave and the newspaper reassigned the miscreant reporters.

                maybe, maybe not.  given there is no one to replace her, that means the place she works will have to contract their services.   and sure, being woke means being willing to drive your business into the ground, but short of that, she will find work and get more $$ in the process.   am willing to bet concierge nursing is a viable business model now.

My gods.  You have no idea of the depth of defense and system density of Globohomo Corporate medicine.
It should be, but there‚Äôs a reason home health or hospitals quickly go to minimalist ‚Äòwellness centers‚Äô  and all-inclusiveness promotion to hire the abjectly stupid, untrainable third world nursing staff at $10 per hour.

            Everyone in that situation needs to stay in the job and not quit ‚Äì force the company to fire them.  And then file a wrongful termination lawsuits ‚Äì and play up whatever angle they can.  For instance, if it happens to your daughter she should remember all the time she was se&gt;&lt;ally  harassed and sue on that basis.  Or whatever angle is at hand.  Corps fear litigation more than anything and there‚Äôs a ton of opportunity for mischief against the evil doers.

            If every current non-vaccinated US commercial airline pilot refused to take the jab by, say, Oct 15, the US airline system would collapse overnight due to shortages of trained personnel.Much the same for any private industry, really.  With record numbers of shipping containers being stuck in port due to lack of a logistical chain, just 10% of truckers walking off the job would cripple the real economy.The welding of corporate and political power WILL spark a pushback as they continue to overreach.  Strong private sector unions would be a logical (and relatively peaceful) pushback.  Which is not to say private unions are all squeaky clean.Because they can‚Äôt fire and replace us all.   Unions played a key role in getting communism out of Poland, because they understood there is great strength in numbers.

                There are rumors of significant numbers of F-22 and F-15 pilots that have resigned their commissions.
If those rumors are true, that is a horrible, probably unintended outcome for the Deep State warmongers.
Each one of those pilots represents years of effort and millions of dollars of training lost.
They would not be easily replaced because there are strict screens for physical and mental traits that weed out almost all of the people who attempt to become military pilots.

                        I was in a job that required near-constant domestic and international travel at the time of 9/11. In fact, I was scheduled to travel to NYC a couple days after the attack (so much for that trip).
For a while I was really uncooperative with airport security in the aftermath, because I didn‚Äôt want to let all this security theater go without pushback. Lost a few tools I used to travel with for work. But it was always just me. Everybody else seemed to buy the ‚Äúit‚Äôs for our own safety‚Äù line.

            I‚Äôm hoping that a large swath of workers stick to their guns, but at the same time, I‚Äôm worried that the fallout to an already teetering economy would be immediate and swift. I pray the bill gets vetoed.
Those football chanters are right.

            This is why it‚Äôs so important to get out there and begin building a parallel society and culture. The things the Gab CEO has done so far are an easy, useful entry point.
Also, remember the jabbed are not a monolithic bloc. There is at least some percentage with buyer‚Äôs remorse who are sympathetic, and there is another subset that find the entire jabport scheme worthy of rejection.

                Many of the vaccinated will hit the 6 month mark soon and be considered ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù unless they get a booster.  A lot of them will refuse to turn their immune systems into a subscription service.

                Another resource that I thought might be worthwhile is the personals site, ‚ÄúUnjected,‚Äù which has business and friends sections, as well as a community board.
Well, my current take is that the site is really in the embryonic stages compared to the media hysteria about it a few weeks ago. Still worth keeping an eye on.
Jim Corbett did an interview with one of the founders that was decent.

                Wild Geese ‚Äì True, and yet . . . My husband, alone among his closest high school and various work buddies, is the only one to remain unvaxxed.  The rest have caved to pressure from spouses or children, or in order to be able to go on a cruise.  These are not weak or stupid men.  I had expected better of them.  The rot goes deeper than many imagine, and the urge to go along to get along is primary.

                    Interesting how little it takes, isn‚Äôt it.  I was on the fence wrt vaccination given I had a diagnosis of Covid and recovered.  Why get a vaccine when the immune system is tuned and running fine?  Let‚Äôs see how things play out with new variants and such.
But recent events of outright lies, lawlessness, and coercion have hardened me to an extreme.  I‚Äôm gonna have to see folks dropping dead in the street before I ever consider submitting to such efforts.  Hard to believe this is the same country I was born in.  We are a pathetic lot.
