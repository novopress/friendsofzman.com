        …but at least they have the moral clarity to understand the difference between an abortion and a manicure”.
Another LOL moment. I’ve never read anything quite like that. So succinct and so very true. That statement is just one example of why you are the best, Z! Keep ’em coming.

        When you control the language of the debate, you control the debate.  “Pro Choice” is much easier to defend than “Pro Death”.

        Speaking of enthusiasm………how about PP’s clinic director Latasha boasting about “…..63 countries…..”
Yay!!!!
BTW…..notice the mention of “…..metal detector, bulletproof windows and round-the-clock security…….”   Intended for the reader to infer protection from roving bands of anti-abortion lunatics.   Which is another steaming helping of BS, of course.  Going back decades the only attacks on PP facilities I can recall happen in places like rural Kentucky or Kansas.  They have all the fortifications b/c this is undoubtedly a real crappy neighborhood (but vibrant! and diverse!…….63 countries!)

                I have never seen a drug store such as Walgreens or CVS that had metal detectors or bullet proof glass. Perhaps some have bullet proof glass in drive-through lanes or in very high crime areas. I wonder if any PP location has ever been subject to an armed robbery due to having controlled substances on site. Riot situations should be excluded due to the inability of these countermeasures to have any effect.

        Even setting morality aside, there is the pure criminality factor, Planned Parenthood is essentially a money laundering operation, 100% of their donations are to Democrats, who when elected provide more funding in return, it’s a circle jerk of corruption, propping each other up. The primary function of Planned Parenthood is really to funnel away tax payer money:“According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), audits show the organization spent just $657.1 million between 2002 and 2008 from federal government grants and programs, but the abortion behemoth’s own annual reports show that it took in $2.3 billion from government grants and programs during the same time period.”“Planned Parenthood has received over $3.9 billion dollars of taxpayer money since 1987. Over $1 billion dollars worth of federal grants (taxpayer dollars) in the years 2002- 2008 is unaccounted for.“Although a non-profit organization, Planned Parenthood reported an average annual surplus of over $40 million from the fiscal years ending in 2001 through 2006 and had over $1 billion in revenue in 2006. Planned Parenthood had a surplus of nearly $115 million and received $336 million dollars from the government in order to carry out its operations.”And when someone voices a concern he is shouted down as a woman hater, it’s a rather brilliant populist strategy, perfect for the sound bite media landscape.

        Great observation on the enthusiasm thing. I never really thought about it, but that applies to a lot of the social issues that i would be neutral on ordinarily, but the weird enthusiasm and worshiping, turns me off and makes me suspicious of hidden agendas

        Dont overlook the benefit to society (and your own wallet) when women chose the abortion.
Most of the women having abortions are on public assistance, and are of little value to society.
While I agree that abortion is barbaric, I shed no tears when Sherilla decides to terminate a pregnancy.  Its one less little bastard that I wont have to pay to raise, educate and incarcerate.

        Great application of Pascal’s Wager to the abortion question. I think it’s the eerie parallels with older death cults that skeeves me out the most. Rather than bore everyone with several paragraphs of bush-league philosophizing, I would refer one and all toApocalyptofor a cinematic comparison.
