        Something that never gets mentioned by dissidents is that this line of reasoning contradicts basic Christian teaching. To cede the public space on principle is to agree, in advance, to not proselytize. To preach and proselytize means staking out space in the public square, regardless of the consequences. The very founding of the Christian faith was on the bones of those, who martyred themselves to spread the word of Jesus Christ in the face of violent opposition.I encounter this a lot. I am called a religious bigot simply for stating that Christianity is the truth and that therefore other religions are false and don‚Äôt deserve equal respect from me.I feel no more obligated to respect Judaism than I do flat Earth ‚Äútheories.‚ÄùTo say that all religions are worthy of equal respect, to endorse those ‚Äúmulti-faith‚Äù prayer breakfasts and similar blasphemies is to set the truth on equal footing with falsehoods.I don‚Äôt expect everyone out there to agree with me,  but for pity‚Äôs sake, if you believe something is true ‚Äî act like it. Otherwise you show that you don‚Äôt really believe what you say.The same holds true for political beliefs.

            Jews and Muslims have no problem with this concept.  I worked in Israel for awhile.  The general feeling of the very nice Jews I worked with was that Jesus was a hippie troublemaker who betrayed his faith, and deserves no thought whatsoever.

        David French is a passive agressive ankle-biting lapdog begging treats from Mx. French at home and dancing for J-right donors at work, a Last Man in every sense.  Z‚Äôs nailed French‚Äôs principal motive before ‚Äì peacocking pride.  What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs a very feminized sort of pride, emblematic of the modern feminized Christian Church ‚Äì the pride of virtue-preening and gossipy snark about status, appearances, social graces, motives and intentions rather than manly deeds and accomplishments. I recommend Dalrock‚Äôs blog for good critiques of this from a Christian perspective, definitely not ‚ÄúOur Guy,‚Äù but Heartiste/manosphere adjacent, and he nails this topic daily.I know a lot of Christians, both Prots and Caths, and there is a definite growth niche for re-masculinized Christianity. It‚Äôs not that far past to begin with. Just before Holocaustianity became a thing, Father Coughlin‚Äôs muscular super-J-woke Catholicism was pulling radio audiences of up to 30 million in a country of 130 million who were 80%+ Protestant.  For more modern exegesis, The Godcast on TRS Sundays bi-weekly is worth a listen on this ‚Äì warning, will very much offend pagans and other heretics. Myles of that pcast is one of the better speakers on TRS in general. As much as his hard monotheism grinds my anti-in-fighting gears, he‚Äôs a very effective spokesman for authentic, non-Judeo-Christianity. Here‚Äôs hoping our descendants will fight with honor over the souls of our ethnostates after we‚Äôve settled all non-White issues first.The cross on which Judeo-Christianity/Holocaustianity has again nailed  Christ is tikkun olam (every single time). In Father Coughlin‚Äôs day, it was mainstream Christian belief that the world was a place of limitations and imperfection where fallible sinners helped those they could and we all patiently awaited Christ‚Äôs Second Coming.  Only then would the battle to ‚Äúperfect the world‚Äù even begin. Holocaustianity‚Äôs foreign injection of the Talmudic concept of tikkun olam (heal/perfect the world) moved up the timetable for all mankind united under Christ kumbaya perfection to the here-and-now.  As is their wont, Jews were not content to patiently wait for God and preferred to perfect everyone according to their own standards now.  Via the Scofield Bible and other Talmudry, the usual suspects weaponized the peacocking of Yankee-church-lady busybodies and turned the scolds loose on their most hated and feared of Christians, the White man.To see cucks like David French LARP Christian leadership while begging for shekels and atta-boys from both muscular Zionist supremacists and their amazon Fish Speakers in Woke Holocaustian Wahmenanity makes hearts sing and hands rub all over Manhattan. Well worth a few shekels to Rich Lowry‚Äôs grift. Conversely, the idea of J-woke White Christian men bringing their wahmens to heel &amp; casting the moneychangers out of their temples (again ‚Äì E.S.T.) haunts their nights like cossack hoofbeats.

            Two things brosef‚Äî
1) Another slam dunk in content. You should consider starting your own blog. Your comments are prolific and on point most of the time.
2) I see you mention CH quite often. You weren‚Äôt Exile there that I‚Äôm aware of, what alias did you use? I‚Äôm certain I would remember a writing style like yours.

Only then would the battle to ‚Äúperfect the world‚Äù even begin.  ‚ÄùI‚Äôm not going to claim to be a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù ‚Äì but that is exactly how I have viewed the world for quite some time.  It has been my experience on a personal and almost daily basis ‚Äì that the world is NOTHING BUT a place of limitations and imperfection ‚Äì and pain.A while back ‚Äì I ran across a video from Jordan Peterson ‚Äì that had me saying YES ‚Äì somebody who is finally elaborating on  what has been my life experience :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0‚Äù It is not an accident that the axiomatic Western individual is someone who was nailed to a cross and tortured. It‚Äôs like YES ‚Ä¶ RIGHT ‚Ä¶ EXACTLY‚Ä¶.. ‚Äù‚Äù There‚Äôs a deep idea in the West too. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúpick up your damn suffering ‚Äì and bear it ‚Äì and try to be a good person so you don‚Äôt make it worse‚ÄùI don‚Äôt see anything like this coming out of Christians these days.  I must be stuck in the old world ‚Äì because my view is elaborated upon pretty accurately by Peterson. Maybe it‚Äôs that Jewish and female influence you referred to.I‚Äôd have to imagine that if somebody like Father Coughlin arrived today ‚Äì he might well get a good audience.  At least among white men.The fact that Peterson says the things he does above ‚Äì and has the ear of a lot of young men ‚Äì is good evidence of this.

        When the nature and future of American public life is being discussed by a creature named Sohrab Amari, it is clear the ship has already been sunk.  If something with a name like that has a respectable say in what America is or what America should do, then it means that America has died and gone to the Pet Sematary.

                It‚Äôs always very interesting to me that guys who converted to Christianity, or switched denominations a couple of years ago, like Amari, Rod Dreher, and Adrian Vermeule always know EXACTLY what it is that their new denomination/religion should do. Presumably no one in Catholicism or Orthodoxy ever thought of any of their ideas until they came along. New ideas are certainly always welcome, but a little humility might also be in order. In addition, I‚Äôm sure that Amari‚Äôs heart is in the right place, but anyone who can be beaten in a debate by David French needs to engage in some serious self-reflection.

        If David French believed in a ‚Äúneutral space‚Äù he would fight for KKK story hour at his local library.   And make sure it was funded and supported, with little kids dressing up in white robes and hoods.
After that, he would fight for Neo-Nazi story hour at the library, with all the costumes and literature.
No, David would fight for Muslim story hour and open borders story hour and every other story hour first.   And condemn even Pat Buchanan story hour‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

            Exactly. David French is just FakeCon.  The Washington generals. The Controlled opposition. For the last 3 years he‚Äôs tried to pose as some sort of ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù between the LIberal/Left and the Trump-Right.  He‚Äôs no different than an American Tory in 1776 who didn‚Äôt like the British, but spent all his time attacking Washington and Adams because  ‚Äúwe need to win independence in the *right* way‚Äù by respecting the Conservative value of Obeying the King.

                    That went over well‚Ä¶
Now, the only reason you guys don‚Äôt consider ‚Äúwhite‚Äù a racial slur, is because, for some incomprehensible reason, you bigots don‚Äôt think that being white is a bad thing, but ‚Äúwhite‚Äù is most definitely meant to be a derogatory label by its authors.

                            I don‚Äôt consider any of the race terms such as Black, Brown, White bigoted or insulting or racist.That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre white ‚Äì top of the evolutionary stack ‚Äì so you don‚Äôt have psychological issues with your skin color. I bet you don‚Äôt have a nervous breakdown either if somebody calls you a cracker.No racial slur against whites carries any real sting because we are so unbelievably awesome, and it enrages them that they can throw any label at us, and we still don‚Äôt give a frack. Nothing worse than having your racial insults met with calm, slightly amused condescension.But yes, next time some poc calls you white, call them brown in return.

                    After moving to San Antonio, Texas in ‚Äô65 I learned to use the term ‚Äúanglo‚Äù to refer to those of us not of Hispanic heritage. I also learned that I was a ‚Äúbolillo‚Äù (white bread ‚Äì from a small bread pastry similar to a dinner roll) ‚Äì so anglo works for me even though my last confirmed ancestor from England was almost 3 centuries past and my most recent ancestors were of Scandinavian descent).For the record, labels can only be ‚Äúderogatory‚Äù if one takes umbrage at them. I was raised with the principle of ‚ÄúSticks and stones may break my bones; but words can never hurt me.‚Äù  Only if I have a chip on my shoulder can ANY word or words be ‚Äúfighting words‚Äù.

            Actually, nothing was founded. Just England expanded a little bit. Later came the independence but US was until recently just one big English county. There is also some inhabited islands next to UK. When Englishmen move there to live, this is not some nation of immigrants.

            Sure, most of the founding fathers were Brits and Protestants.  Catholics did play a role too. Problem is you limit yourself to that demographic and you get 2 problems.1.  Your numbers will be a tiny fraction of what you need.2.  How many British Protestants today are capable of doing what the founding fathers did?White Christianity gives us a broader base without compromising ourselves on something essential.  I am a European mutt and a Catholic.  This is my home.  I know of no other.  Given the history of America and how various European countries colonized this land, that gives me the right to call myself an American.

                1. Your numbers will be a tiny fraction of what you need.What do you need? Democracies work best in small units; I figure 5-5¬Ω million is the perfect size for a state. (Not that I‚Äôm prejudiced in that regard.)And yes, I‚Äôm aware that America was populated by a range of different Europeans, but the founding of the nation was a very British affair.My point about objecting to the label ‚Äúwhite‚Äù is that it‚Äôs generic, anodyne. ‚ÄúHeritage American‚Äù or ‚ÄúEuropean American‚Äù is a much more powerful carrier of identity. ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù, or ‚ÄúIrish‚Äù or ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù American even more so.You should demand that the next census survey contains options for Americans of every European ethnic group, don‚Äôt accede to just being called ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. (Incidentally, this would allow you to play the minority card at the drop of a hat.)I realize this is a hard sell in America ‚Äì after all, you became Americans because you didn‚Äôt want to be European. But reaching back across the breach with the Old World, would give your children ownership to a treasure trove of identity and culture. Scandinavia is the least Latinised region of Europe, but I still consider the people of Rome and Athens my spiritual progenitors, and it doesn‚Äôt take away from my Scandinavian heritage, it adds to it.

                    Well said Felix. I think part of the unease is due to the fact that European solidarity is just beginning in the USA, and is coalescing under ‚Äúwhite‚Äù auspices. ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù also includes more periphery white groups wgo are not necessarily Euro: white appearing, multi-generational American Latinos, Lebanese, etc. I agree that Euro-american is a much more powerful marker (and probably more accurate. ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù Latinos would do well to pivot toward their Euro heritage, and ME Christians have a cultural/spiritual connection with Europe), but many are loathe to counter-signal it. They find strength in owning the slur.

I believe they already do that, at least until they come to America and discover the wonders of victimhood. Brazil, I‚Äôm confidently told by some guy on the internet, has a semi-formalized racial hierarchy that would make antebellum planters dizzy with its complexity. You can forget about the one-drop rule, they have one-drop rules, three-drop rules, seventeen-drop rules, they have race down to a mathematical science.

                We never had the chance to become Americans, a branch of the European Caucasoids.  All stocks and regions were shoehorned into a one size fits all constitution.  Had we been left to our natural inclination and preferences we probably would have formed regional nations or maybe a sort of Swiss confederation among those regions.Despite the forced sameness of the constitution  we managed to build a nation with different regional sensibilities.This was destroyed by the Civil War and the mercantilism  orchestrated government  (MOG) that followed.  The unnecessary western catastrophe of 1914-1945 completed the sapping of vitality of all western peoples. They were eager and open to being flogged and hustled.  MOG got ZOG‚Äôed and here we are. Very little of the social structure of the past 2 or 3 centuries is worth preserving. Nature has some housecleaning to perform.

        Patriot Prayer in Portland.
But the Public Square or space is the shell game.  A generation ago they got rid of Obscenity, Pornography, and Blasphemy laws in the name of free speech.  Now they wan‚Äôt to censor ‚ÄúHate Speech‚Äù which means things like ‚ÄúIts okay to be white‚Äù or quoting the Bible.

            One big problem with Patriot Prayer is they need to pick a side. Either ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù or ‚Äúprayer‚Äù but not both. The fact that their leader is not even an American makes the ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù part seem contrived. Then you have their tactics, which are all about causing a scene with Antifa. Street theater is always about the theater, rather than the street. If they want to bring people into their faith, their focus should be on recruiting and their public expression should be aimed toward that, rather than costumed warfare with college lesbians.

                I know you frown on fighting in the streets, yet I have always wondered whether Patriot Prayer, civnat as they come, isnt a pathway for some of the normies to find us. It must be awfully frustrating to live in a city where lawless imbeciles are allowed and encouraged by leftist pols to disrupt the normies basic tasks like getting to work or picking up kids from school. And i cannot be the only one who would love to vacay in Portland during one of these antifa riots to practice kickboxing. Now most folks aren‚Äôt going to practice kickboxing, yet will spectate. And as spectators of the chaos, particularly the nonfeasance of the Popo, eventually turn against the regime that protects and allows the chaos. My point is antifa creates incentives and PP a pathway for normies to begin the Hajj to reality. Of course, i could be full of shite and just a big fan of kickboxing!

                            The interesting thing is, six years ago this fall, the feds in Seattle were busy ripping apart the anarchists in Portland with a series of grand juries chasing down the perpetrators of their once-unpopular May Day chaos downtown.They hauled a young woman, Leah-Lynne Plante, up to Seattle from Portland and then tossed her into jail when she refused to testify before the grand jury. Another grand jury ‚Äúresister‚Äù did a lot of time, but Plante couldn‚Äôt take it, walked out ‚Äî who knows what she did or didn‚Äôt say ‚Äî and immediately was snitchjacketed. She disappeared off the map after that.Seems like a different world now.

                        Theocracy fuses those two masters, doesn‚Äôt it? An ‚ÄúIsrael for Europeans‚Äù still sounds like a good idea to me. Actually, I think we used to have an Israel for Europeans; we called it Europe, and then there was a smaller version called the U.S.A. Both may be toast now.

                            A Christian theocracy would not be ‚Äònationalist‚Äô but imperialist (in the sense of ruling over multiple different peoples). The Catholic Church‚Äôs domination of Europe is an example of a theocracy ruling over different ‚Äònations‚Äô (races). In a sense, the opportunities for ‚Äòpatriotism‚Äô (a love of one‚Äôs patria) is entirely subsumed under the religious imperative. The nation-state was an alternative to the Catholic empire, not a function of it.

                        Funny you should mention that, Z-man. I seem to recall some guy in the new testament, I think, who said something like his kingdom was not of this world and render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar‚Äôs. So one can be part of both religion and nation. And I‚Äôm not any sort of expert on the bible but even I can see the flaw in your argument.Spiritual matters are transcendent and personal and are not strongly linked to the material world except as guides in matters of morality and choice. Dump Christianity in particular and religion in general takes away a higher power than man that establishes certain moral truths. All that remains is morality that man himself creates which can be altered or abolished at his own whims or needs. The essence of post-modernism. That man creates his own morality, man becomes himself god. Then if man is his own god, he can create his own heaven on earth. This is the essence of progressivism. Cultural Christianity, at least, is necessary and useful even to the hereditary strong-man aristocrats of yesteryear.Something that libertarian and objectivist apostates firmly and solely rooted in pure materialism have trouble understanding.

                        Christ also asked if those who were to follow him were prepared to hate their mothers and fathers. He of course was speaking symbolically, in short, were they prepared to despise the old ways and traditions to seek truth.If Zman‚Äôs core belief is that we whites cannot rescue the United States from it‚Äôs current course then something new for us must be built. Therefor his statement about picking a side ‚Äúpatriot or prayer‚Äù and referencing Christ‚Äôs discussion serving two masters is consistent with his argument.I don‚Äôt wish to misrepresent our esteemed host, that is my perception of his argument gleaned from reading and listening to him.  If I am wrong then mea culpa.Don‚Äôt know if his approach is correct or not, but if I surmise his belief on this accurately then his argument that one cannot be a patriot and a Christian is at least consistent.

                        ZMan, it was the Carpenter‚Äôs Son who made that observation but the context would not support your interpretation. Cornelius was a Centurion (roughly equivalent to a company commander in the Army or Marines and thus an O-3 ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù) but when he and his family were converted by (a very reluctant)  Apostle Peter, he was not required to resign his commission and leave the Army. The dichotomy in the passage you referenced was between serving The Creator or MONEY (personified by the false god Mammon). Were your interpretation valid, a person could not be a Christian and hold down a job. Unfortunately for that interpretation, through the Apostle Paul we are command that in the area of charity, ‚ÄúHe who does not work shall not eat.‚Äù (This was in reference to people capable of work but chose not to do.) Apparently, The Creator is not a big fan of welfare for people who are able to work because immediately after the above Paul wrote, ‚Äú[W]e hear that some of you are living in laziness, refusing to work, and wasting your time in gossiping. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we appeal to such people ‚Äî we command them ‚Äî to quiet down, get to work, and earn their own living.‚Äù Other passages by other writers indicate that The Creator thinks it is OK to work for a living and that the one who works is worthy of their wages.

In theory?  Yes.
In practice?  No, not if being a Christian means never casting stones but instead collaborating with obvious evil by always giving Shlomo whatever the fvck he wants because Schindler‚Äôs List said so.

                    Historically this country was founded by Christian men for Christian men and Christian men fought died over the centuries for our country.So the patriotism and Christianity can mix.That said Patriot Prayer is going about things all wrong. Their leadership is nothing short of idiotic. They are like the DR was when Spencer and his clown posse ran the show.Now the DR  isn‚Äôt much better. To this day no one knows what it stands for, opposes, what it goals are, etc.It‚Äôs so bad it would be impossible to even put together a 4 page pamphlet for recruiting new members.

        I think what you previously said about dissident politics needs to also apply to people who want to be real Christians. Since Christianity is illegal in America (its central doctrines on homosexuality, etc.) the Christian needs to view himself not as someone who needs to shout in the public square, but someone who needs to start building in the shadows. We‚Äôre day-walkers. Let the Israel-worshiping hucksters like Robertson or prosperity hustlers like Olstein fleece their flock with the jumbotron, and instead think local. Think ichthys drawn in the sand or scrimshawed on a wall.

                If religious proscriptions against homosexuality aren‚Äôt your thing, try science, specifically medical science. When you look at the CDC data, it is still incredibly physically destructive and spreads all kinds of diseases that have massive external costs to the society as a whole. A lot of people who weren‚Äôt homophobic previously had their children killed by transfusions of blood from HIV-infected men who lobbied the ACLU in the 80s to not have to disclose their status (this is still a strong font of ‚Äúactivism‚Äù for the left; see Douglas Starr‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce‚Äù). I can be pretty tolerant, but people take it personal sometimes when you murder their children with your sin and stupidity. In more basic terms, the purpose of the end of the alimentary canal is to expel waste from the body, not to insert things.

                    The triumph of the gay rights movement really is astonishing and disheartening.  It‚Äôs been said for years that for the first time in history, a fatal disease (AIDS) had civil rights.  The victims are ignored.Homosexuals are the probably the most disease-ridden people on the planet due to their promiscuity, general hedonism (high rates of drinking, smoking and drug usage) and the fact that the human anus is a poopshoot and stuff is supposed to come out, not go in.  One of the reasons for the breakdown of sexual self-restraint in general is effective modern-day medical treatment.  A century ago, the promiscuous would have darwinized themselves out of existence.The transgender rights movement is an outgrowth of the gay rights movement.  Like the Energizer Bunny, the Left keeps going and going, growing more and more insane.

                        I‚Äôve argued with some Christian acquaintances that they were going about their opposition to homosexuality all wrong.The Christians in my experience ‚Äì all approach the homosexuality question as if these people can be saved.  And they seem to utterly refuse to take what the homos say ‚Äì and use it against them.I was around during the 80s when the homos really started becoming ‚Äúloud and proud‚Äù ‚Äì and I remember very distinctly what they did when confronted with the AIDS ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù:They blamed it on everybody else but themselves.Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed about the homosexuals:‚Äì the refuse to take responsibility for the things that happen to them because of their behavior‚Äì they want to claim they are normal, and want to enforce that thru the laws ‚Äì as well as proselytize it to the children‚Äì they hate the ‚Äòbreeders‚Äô‚Äì they wanted marriage not so much out of any REAL belief in equality , but because it was another avenue into the world of free shit ‚Äì and it also allowed them to wave their dicks in front of the normies‚Äì ‚Äúgay culture‚Äù has no real positivity to it.  It‚Äôs simply a celebration of perversions and disfunction.‚Äì homosexuals are LIARSWhen the gays started yelling about how ‚Äúnormal‚Äù they were ‚Äì the Christians (and all of us in fact) ‚Äì should have said: ‚ÄúOk ‚Äì we‚Äôre going to take you at your word and start treating you as you claim to be‚Äù.All the laws around adoption of children and birth assistance (IVF , surrogacy ‚Äì etc) ‚Äì should have been written to include a clause that only allowed their use by persons ‚Äúwho might normally be able to produce children of their own accord‚Äù.And the marriage laws should have been rewritten to actually punish those who married ‚Äúoutside their stated normalcy‚Äù.  What I mean by that is:  if you want to claim you‚Äôre homosexual and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ‚Äì then you will be prosecuted if  you marry a female.Cut the homos off from reproducing ‚Äì and FORCE them to stick to their claimed state of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù  and you‚Äôd see them start dying off in a generation or two.Society has forced homosexuals to ‚Äúlive undercover‚Äù.  Because of this ‚Äì homosexuals are still around ‚Äì because they‚Äôve been reproducing.  I know homosexual men who have done this seemingly on purpose.  They marry women ‚Äì have kids ‚Äì and then ‚Äúgo gay‚Äù.  Gays want to live in out in the open?  Fine ‚Äì let them.  But make sure there are consequences to that.  Disbar them from access to ‚Äúbreeders‚Äù or the technology that has grown up to help breeders have children.Don‚Äôt allow them to continue lying their way into continued existence.Honesty = extinction.It strikes me that the Christian approach to homosexuality is roughly analogous to the conservative/David French types approach to leftism.They claim to oppose it ‚Äì but their actions actually enable it.

                            I remember that Pres. Reagan was blamed for the AIDs epidemic.The modern-day emphasis on equality, individual rights, liberty and the pursuit of happiness makes it more difficult to defy the gay activists.  Religion did so in the past, along with the limits of medical treatment and the practical necessity of forming a traditional family.I understand what you are suggesting ‚Äì that if a man says he is gay, and being gay is normal, he will not be allowed to marry a woman.  I don‚Äôt know how you can enforce that law.Mayor Pete Buttplug postures as a churchgoing married guy no different than you or me, except that he‚Äôs gay.  He even said that he and his ‚Äúhusband‚Äù plan to have the baby.  How will you do that, Cupcake?  Adopt?  Hire a surrogate?  One-half of the equipment needed for making a baby is missing in your ‚Äúmarriage.‚ÄùThe Soviets decriminalized homosexuality in 1917, but recriminalized it in 1933.  The official culture of the Soviet Union in general became more socially conservative and remained so even in the 1980s, when the Commies were still tough on gays, lesbians and junkies. The reason for this was that the Commies emphasized the common good over individual happiness.

                                At this stage of the societal game ‚Äì it‚Äôs probably impossible to enforce any of it thru legal means.It doesn‚Äôt mean though that we can‚Äôt ‚Äì on a more personal basis ‚Äì call them out on their bullshit.For some reason women seem enthralled by the gays.  There‚Äôs an awful lot of the media that really pushes the idea of women and gay men being ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù. And from what I‚Äôve seen ‚Äì that carries thru into real life as well.My wife knows a number of gay men.  Over the years ‚Äì simply by pointing out their bullshit ‚Äì I‚Äôve been able to get her to recognize that they are a bunch of liars ‚Äì as well as point out the insanity of some of the things they say.  In the case of the men she knows ‚Äì every‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. single‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. one of them ‚Äì was married to a women before ‚Äì had kids with her ‚Äì and then left her for gaydom.Women hate this shit.  But the culture tells them that gay men are supposed to be great.  Start pointing out their (the gay men‚Äôs that is) ‚Äì horseshit ‚Äì and all of the attraction starts to fade away.Women talk too ‚Äì so they tell their friends.I‚Äôve found that pointing out the insanity of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù claim by gays ‚Äì is one of the more effective arguments to crowbar‚Äôing some sanity into those who are enthralled with the homos.

            Correct. And that may be part of the problem that perplexes our esteemed blog host. Honest to God real Christians fly below the radar as a matter of course. Nobody notices the well adjusted families and communities ‚Äì why should they? They are never a problem and therefore do not attract attention. They‚Äôre courteous and polite as a part of their culture and will go to lengths to avoid confrontation. Anger and rage are quick tickets to sin. They create good communities for themselves, and unlike other religous groups ‚Äì engage with others to help out.There are megatons of raw power in that demographic that the progs and leftists can‚Äôt use. Cucks like French and the NRO gang can‚Äôt either. The first guy that comes along and sees that demographic and succeeds in  hitching his wagon to it ‚Äì stands to gain some very valuable allies.I am not surprised at all that our host realizes this. He may need to search his soul and tread carefully though: Real Christians will not be used by the Dissident Right, Conservative Inc, or anyone else. They will partner with the right players, but only if their morals, ethics and interests are respected. From what I am seeing here there may well indeed be a good fit between the dissident and the honest Christian ‚Äì but care will have to be taken to maintain that relationship on good terms.

                John Smith, no one speaks of grace any more.  Grace is a hidden virtue in our culture.  It is still out there, demonstrated every day.  But it is a quiet thing.  It is not particularly interested in hitching its wagon to anything, it is simply doing and saying the right things at the right moments, as one would expect from good people.

                John Smith:  ‚Äù They‚Äôre courteous and polite as a part of their culture and will go to lengths to avoid confrontation.‚ÄùSorry, but that is not enough any longer, if it ever was.  Merely quietly living a decent life and hoping you‚Äôll get eaten last.  Those who don‚Äôt see just how bad it is out there are those who WON‚ÄôT see.  No, I‚Äôm not endorsing street theatre, certainly not when the force of the state and apparatus of muh law are arrayed against us.  But this purported division between being a Christian and recognizing the reality (and godliness) of HBD and protecting/promoting one‚Äôs own must end.  The now defunct websiteFaith and Heritageexplored and biblically explained the issue far better than I can.  Their archives are all there and well worth anyone‚Äôs reading.

                Well said.  As a Christian HBD realist, I wish to treat others with respect and compassion, but also cannot ignore statistical correlations.  As Derb has pointed out, in real life you have to play the probabilities.  I do not want violence, but also see the violence done to us and do not wish to knuckle under.  I will always vote dissident and can embrace fighters with personal moral failings, but to go to the next level is a constant balancing act.  Though I am amazed at how far I have moved in the last 10 years.

            Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôll need to get a great number of them at least marginally on your/their own side if any real change is to be effected.  You‚Äôll need to change their thinking, and that takes thoughtfulness and tact (I don‚Äôt have faith that some sort of collapse will spontaneously effect it).  People are not rational, and propaganda works, and modern Westerners live their entire lives submerged in an ocean of it.  We must remember the audience, the context, the situation.  I wish it weren‚Äôt this way, but I‚Äôm afraid that it is.

        Had the pleasure of attending my sister‚Äôs modern, millennial church recently. You know the type, lots of soft blue lighting, rock-n-roll band playing before the service, hands in the air, and a young, dynamic preacher who made everyone feel real good about themselves, etc, etc. Basically, self-help group therapy dressed up as Christianity. They are all very, very full of love and acceptance for everyone, especially those who would destroy their country and their families. Their version of Jesus Christ is basically John Lennon without the music career.Trust me, this type of ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù is (if I recall correctly) the most popular type in America. They are also very definitely NOT on our side. They are the David French types and they are modern American Christianity. We can only hope that the next generations, if they embrace Christianity at all, find a more orthodox version.

            Very full of love and acceptance for everyone, except for those who do not toe the line on the socially approved leftie laundry list of things.  Those rotten people get two minutes of hate, thrown right into the middle of the service. Part of the fun is to predict when the gears will change and the two minutes will kick in.  Usually about five minutes before the end of the sermon.  Just to tie the bow up tight and send everyone out to brunch and Costco fully filled with angry righteousness, masked by enthusiastic ephemeral ‚Äúlove for all*‚Äù.  The asterisk representing the exception, which is the non person that you and I represent.  As predictable as darkness after sundown.

                Agreed Dutch. My brother-in-law is a very strong believer in that type of ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù. He goes to church, is involved with it, holds Bible studies at his house and all that other good stuff. Yet, he spends a lot of time on Facebook ranting about Trump and the ‚Äúhaters‚Äù who support him. The rest of the family have simply learned not to talk politics near him, or try to correct his NPC sputterings.He‚Äôs typical of the liberal members of his church, and the Trump supporters at the church are typically quiet about it, so as not to have to deal with the ‚Äúlove‚Äù and ‚Äútolerance‚Äù that will come their way if they‚Äôre not.

            We church-shopped after moving to the desert a few years ago, all non-denominational (hence not formally and officially leftist) Protestant congregations. The closest I ever came to walking out of a service was when one preacher said, ‚ÄúThere is no room for racists in heaven.‚Äù
That‚Äôs funny, my understanding was that Judas Iscariot will be in heaven if among his final thoughts was repentance.

            Remember that the 90k subscribers includes the ones where they extend the subscription for three years for 50 cents (because extending for free doesn‚Äôt count in the ‚Äúpaid‚Äù subscription rolls).  Also the people that autopay their renewals and have somehow disappeared.  I figure the full-boat subscribers at under 10k.

When she learned I could speak a little Spanish (very little), she asked me to accompany her missionary group next year. I asked her why she had spent 30 years going back and forth to a Spanish-speaking country without learning to speak Spanish.

            I have a good friend from church who became fairly jaded after a missionary trip to the South.

Yes, they smiled and said thanks and waved goodbye at the end, but they did nothing to help with such efforts on their behalf.He (and I) then volunteered our time and effort on this side of the border‚Äîhe now patrols along the border and calls in illegals and drug mules to the BP.  üòâ

The key word there is not Christianity, butmilitant. We have to secure our rights as a people. But genuine rights are really justpowerin one of its aspects‚Äìreal power, meaning, backed up by violence and the threat of violence. No violence, no rights.

            Western civilization is inextricably entwined with Christianity.  You don‚Äôt have to be a believer, but you have to accept it as part of the core Western and American identity.  Putin, for example, understands this.  That is why he is a booster of Orthodoxy in Russia.  I do not think he is a devout Orthodox Christian, but he knows that Orthodoxy is an essential part of the Russian identity.  Their civilization cannot be whole without it.

                Interesting that Putin seems to accept the Orthodox Church for what it is, rather than trying to convert it to something else for his own ends.  Would that those in the West would treat the ‚Äúhome‚Äù religion in a similar ‚Äúhands off‚Äù fashion, rather than trying to bend it to their selfish secular practices. Putin strikes me as a real adult in the room, despite his dark background and scary behind-the-scenes activities.

                        ‚ÄúI am not preaching anti-intellectuality, but extolling the licentiousness and chthonian violence of re-integration. The affliction which Indo-Europeans suffer from is entirely mental and subjective; they are chronically afraid of their own shadow in Jungian terms.

        Sohrab lost the debate, but French was postulating from fantasy land so egregiously that it is hard to see anyone walking out with a better opinion of either.
Not much point overall, as these academic dock-waving contests only appeal to 0.01 percent of the population , and it is not like the right has any power in academia to propagate the winners ideology.

        There are two ghosts haunting the Amari/French dialog: Joseph McCarthy and Martin Luther King. As far as people like French are concerned, MLK is more important than Jesus. And, of course, any talk of driving the enemies of Christianity from the ‚Äòpublic space‚Äô is ‚ÄòMcCarthyism‚Äô. The Zman is right, of course, when he says that Christianity was never intended to be a navel-gazing affair, but a revolutionary cause (which is *exactly* how the Romans interpreted the behavior of the Jesus cult). While the Zman bring up martyrdom as an example of the ‚Äòaggressive‚Äô nature of Christianity, I tend to focus on the fact that the most common ‚Äòmiracle‚Äô in the Synoptics is exorcism. Jesus gave no quarter to the spiritual enemies of the human race.

So do I.  Two of my great concerns: are they consuming the same types of media we are?  Do their elites, a product of liberal democracy + capitalism (like our elites), have the same incentives ours do?  Ireland was a bastion of relative tradition and nationalism up until 20 years ago, and they‚Äôve since collapsed into liberal disintegration (right after the end of internal strife and a great rise in economic growth, notably).  Another example of this would be Spain, which has similarly transformed since the death of Franco/Francoism in the 1970‚Äôs.

        Everywhere I go, when I mention the Great Replacement, the whites (and nonwhites!) strongly agree that our elites hate us.
Today, a Western gal said, ‚ÄúI believe in both God ‚Äìand‚Äì Darwin, and that there are more than one.‚Äù  She could respect others‚Äô, but her own came first.
That is exactly right.  Without us and what formed us, this world collapses into darkness and savagery.

            The ‚Äúdispensationalists‚Äù or millenialists, seeing the New Testament primarily as a guide to the End Times, have always had a great deal of cultivation and shekels from the proto-Zionists, who have a similar vision of Jerusalem.
Scofield‚Äôs wildly popular Reference Bible, and modern political evangels such as Falwell, Graham, Roberts, and Hagee have received, well, huge amounts of shekels and media support.  The same was true of the Vatican ll crowd.  After all, the original authors wrote and edited the Book for the same reasons.  Ancient politics were no different from today.

        Proselytization becomes a tough issue where the faith claims a higher authority than the people.  As I noted yesterday, Jews neatly solved this problem by making themselves God‚Äôs Chosen and thus effectively uniting their people and God.  Their myths of golden calves and Yahweh‚Äôs wrath notwithstanding, there is no functional behavioral distinction between even secular Jewish tribal interests and the moral judgments and requirements of Jewish religion.  They‚Äôre functionally the same.  Unless Christians affect this convergence, they‚Äôd be subject to the Prager trap of disloyalty to the people in the interests of a higher moral authority.  In that we are not ‚Äúthe state‚Äù right now, it‚Äôs an issue we can defer, as their proselytization just undermines the Empire. However, for the future‚Äôs sake,tt would be a good idea to start planting some doctrinal seeds &amp; re-adjusting theological interpretations and priorities to be fully compatible with ethno-states based on HBD sooner than later.

        When I first read about this scuffle between Ahmari and French last May, they (American Greatness) made it look like Ahmari was the fighter and French was the effete parlor room conservative tea sipping talker.  So, I sided with the former and was so pleased with myself that I cancelled NR at least five years ago.After reading this blog and interjecting some vitriol over at Crisis Magazine comment section yesterday against French, I‚Äôm going back to reading military stuff.  At least Ahmari, at first, seemed to try to put up a face that said conservatism needed to have some muscle and fight in it.  I agree with this blogger.

            Rules of law written on paper are only effective if there is raw power to back them up.  There must be a sufficient number of people who care about respecting a rule of law, who can field sufficient power (they must be willing to sacrifice their well-being or their lives for these rules of law, and have the material means to bring sufficient force).  If people have been rendered too muddle-headed or ignorant to care, too cowardly and materialistic to sacrifice, too materially weak to bring sufficient force to the table, then the rules of law, and those who seek their defense in them, will be overthrown by those who find them an impediment.

        This debate and others like it are a sideshow; they are meaningless, a waste of time.It‚Äôs like arguing with your neighbor in April 1945 Berlin what color neckties should be worn when the Russian Army is about to launch their final offensive to take the city.Guess what, the Russian Army could give a shit; you are a dead man.While these talking heads attempt to demonstrate how smart they are in front of their minuscule (as compared to the number of folks who vote) adoring crowds, we have a bunch of Stalinist wannabes vying to become president of the USA.And if one of these demokrats becomes president, this nation will be totally F‚Äôd.Just reading what folks like Warren, Sanders, et. al., propose, makes it clear that the US economy will literally collapse if they or their ilk are elected. It‚Äôs clear they abhor the Constitution, capitalism and the USA; and particularly the PEOPLE of this nation.They simply hate our guts.You may despise Trump , but he is a billion times better ‚Äì for the PEOPLE ‚Äì  than any of the Stalinist wannabe demokrats vying to be president.The present line up of demokrat nominees make Obama look like a neo-Nazi , right wing fanatic.What‚Äôs more stupid than watching a French/Ahmari debate is actually debating/discussing the merits of what they say.Nobody gives a flying F what they say or who they are.They are nobodies , zeros, non-entities, meaningless, invisible in the real world scheme of things.Yep, I will confess that I have never heard of Ahmari or French and I have no intention of learning about them.It would be wast of time.I am concerned that if a Warren or her ilk get elected, it will definitely and detrimentally  affect me economically, it will do likewise to the vast majority of the citizenry and will set the USA on a downward spiral that will take decades, if ever, to reverse.(Think of the govt. bureaucratic paradigm established by FDR in the 1930s; the USA is STILL hostage to that neo-fascist model of govt. Indeed, Mussolini himself as well as the official news outlets of Hitler‚Äôs Nazi Party approved of  FDRs New Deal).Honestly, if any of those dems get elected, let‚Äôs hope that right thinking deep state folks  or whomever ‚Äì e.g., the military, etc., ‚Äì literally,  find a way to remove them from office.

                I have no idea what is Accelerationism.I just know that the more powerful and overbearing government becomes, the more the citizenry loses their individual rights. .The founders of this nation were aware of this and thus established three branches of government as well as the electoral college voting system , all in the effort to minimize the chance of a tyrannical form of govt.The system of Federalism they established, but which has become greatly diminished due to the Civil War, the establishment of the federal income tax and the direct election of US Senators, was the ultimate ‚Äútool‚Äù available to curb the power of the Federal govt.But over time. the Federal Govt. has now become a monster, despite the best intentions implicit in the US Constitution.Unfortunately, the SCOTUS too has  become an enabler of greater Federal Govt. powers.We must face reality and deal with the hand we are dealt.Wasting time listening to debates betwixt talking heads showing off their verbal and intellectual skills does nothing but take our eyes off the ball.The immediate existential threat are the Stalinist wannabe presidential hopefuls and their supporters; a bunch of power hungry, egomaniacal  leftist wackos; and they are very, very dangerous individuals indeed.

Pushing back along the way, once government gets to a certain point, is counterproductive because it prolongs the agony of dealing with the present system rather than letting it fall from its own contradictions.
Unfortunately, we won‚Äôt know if accelerationism is worthwhile, in this case, until after the fact.

                        Note that waiting to allow things to fall apart gave the Bolsheviks 70 years to F things up and produced about 30 million killed.The Cuban people have now been waiting over 60 yearsfor the ‚Äúincompetents‚Äù to mess up, and the citizens in Venezuela have now been waiting about 10 years.The BIG problem with allowing the ‚Äúincompetents ‚Äù (by the way, leftists are  NOT incompetents; they know exactly what they are doing) time to destroy themselves is that they destroy everything else as well, including the livelihood  and lives of the citizenry.Further, once in power, they find means to disarm (take away their guns)  the public and financially ruin any ‚Äúdissidents.‚ÄùThe internet now allows the latter to be accomplished rather easily; one IRS email to an individual‚Äôs bank, place of employment, etc., and bingo, you are broke and your wages are confiscated.If Accelerationism is what you state it is, it is suicide and demonstrates an ignorance of history.It‚Äôs like telling those marched into the Gulags/ gas chambers, that, hey no problem, eventually Stalin / Hitler and their adherents will fall away and then we can start anew.Sure; after you are long deadThe leftists seeking power must be stopped now, in their tracks, before they take down everybody with them.And if it means eliminating them ‚Äì existentially ‚Äì then so be it.If Hitler, Stalin,Castro, Mao, Chavez, Maduro had been taken care of at the right time, the entire world would have benefited.Letting these sorts of folks obtain power is suicidal.100 million died in the 20th century when leftists ran the showWarren, Harris, Sanders, Biden, et. al., must never be allowed to obtain power. And if they do, let‚Äôs hope that right thinking folks take the necessary action to see them gone ‚Äì permanently ‚Äì them and all their supporters.

                            The vestiges of my CivNat roots try to remind me that everything should work out alright, over time, if I just play by the rules and vote.  Then I get real.

Things will be ugly, but there is only so much a person can do to change the direction of things.

                                I tried to edit this comment but couldn‚Äôt.  I wanted to add that I used to lean toward accelerationism, but I‚Äôve come to view it as being too optimistic.  I don‚Äôt believe events can be relied upon to spontaneously make the needed changes in thinking.It reminds me of orthodox Marxists confidently asserting that workers would one day spontaneously become orthodox Marxist in their thinking, and that the workers of the world would unite as cosmopolitan Marxist revolutionaries.  Men like Gramsci had the intelligence to see-through this, and set about attempting to effect the changes they desired by other means (after making a more clear-eyed study of man and the world).We need to do what we can to effect the required changes in thinking, thoughtfully, prudently, taking a clear-eyed stock of the circumstances we‚Äôre confronted with.  Deteriorating conditions will contribute to opening minds, but they cannot be relied upon to change minds in the needed way, or to the needed extent.

        At first, I had no idea what ‚ÄúFrenchism‚Äù was. Then I read the First Things article that, among other things, said that David French also promulgated the Russian collusion conspiracy against Trump, like so much of the left, even though this acquisition was obviously bogus from the get go. So, I still have no idea what ‚ÄúFrenchism‚Äù is, other than I think David French is full of shit.

        There is a growing recognition of the game theCatholic chatterers, pro-life leadership, etc. are playing. My favorite guy on this topic is David Wemhoff, author of a book on America‚Äôs manipulation of the Catholics‚Äô understanding of their own doctrine through media power (titled John Courtney Murray, Time/Life, and the American Proposition).  Virtually every Catholic media outlet, push comes the shove, has fallen in with supporting the American ideology.Wemhoff is probably the best bang for your minute when it comes to understand this.  I always try to point other Catholics to this guy.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5wvWhdP3sAlso, Amintore Fanfani‚Äôs ‚ÄúCatholicism, Protestantism, and Capitalism‚Äù (free from project Gutenberg) should be mandatory reading for anybody who wants to understand how the liberal/capitalist spirit is so good at taking over and using institutions and social causes for its own ends.

            American priest John Courtney Murray‚Äôs teachings being adopted at Vatican II to overturn Tradition and transform the Catholic Church into a wing of the Revolution is a prime example of the liberal contagion at work in the world.I‚Äôve had that book for some time, but only read the first 10 or so pages.  George O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs ‚ÄòAn Essay on the Economic Effects of the Reformation‚Äô and ‚ÄòAn Essay on Mediaeval Economic Teaching‚Äô (the latter available at archive.org) I would say are similar titles.  There‚Äôs a vast world of Right-wing anti-capitalism to be explored, and not just the Catholic economic thinking of Aquinas and Medieval Christendom, Distributism, (Catholic) Corporatism, and Guild Socialism (among others), but expanding outward into Werner Sombart and non-Catholic Corporatism, for example.  It‚Äôs easy to appropriate the ideas of certain Leftist anti-capitalist thinkers into a traditional Right framework as well.Capitalism is not neutral, it is inherently globalist (it provides the economic incentive for it), and has massive ramifications on who the elite are, what their incentives are, and brings social changes (like female employment, low fertility, demands for cheap labor, ‚Ä¶) and cultural changes (the drive for consumers, advertising, a culture of materialism/hedonism, as well as ever more indebtedness).  Capitalism yields economic centralization as well, and more wage slaves/fewer owners of the means of production (ever fewer family farms and businesses).  The struggle to acquire and maintain a middle-class existence is requiring people to move ever more and ever further away from each other, breaking family and community ties, breaking rootedness.  The old guild system represented a source of power between the individual and the state, thus checking the power of the latter.  This was destroyed, and the state, under liberal democracy, naturally comes under the power of Money, the tiny class of obscenely wealthy who own/control the means of production.  It‚Äôs not a good order of things; in the long-run it‚Äôs an engine for obliterating the West, and beyond.

            There is plenty of fruitless and stupid debate out there, but keep in mind that the Left‚Äôs power lay in contaminating peoples‚Äô minds with their ideas (via mass media and education).  That‚Äôs how they maintain legitimacy even in the minds of whites as the left liberal elite/system is working diametrically against their interests and the interests of their offspring.  The elite, the system that has empowered and incentivized them (liberalism), and the ideas that drive/justify the whole process (our contemporary left-liberalism (and contemporary right-liberalism is no true opposition or threat to them)) all need to be delegitimized in the eyes of our people, and it will take ideas to effect this.Even an economic catastrophe would, in my opinion, only lead most whites to beg our elite to get the plantation, the machine of Western extermination, up and running again, to get the stores restocked and so on (we‚Äôre not farmers anymore, consuming local or near local goods.  The functioning of the global economy is vital to supplying the needs and wants of the peoples of the West).We need ideas not just to delegitimize the elite and their liberal system, but to internally fire, cohesively unify, and correctly direct our people to take advantage of any and all opportunities for escape.  It takes collective effort and mass self-sacrificial determination to effect major change in the world, ‚ÄúProvidence is always on the side of the big battalions‚Äù (there are exceptions/qualifications to this I know).  As conditions deteriorate, white people will become more open to new ideas, and the spread of those new ideas can bring our people to effect greater strain on the liberal elite and their liberal system, producing cracks, openings, opportunities for our collective escape (again, if we‚Äôre comprised in such a way that we can take advantage of opportunities.  You cannot exploit an opening, fill a vacuum, if everyone is hiding in their basement in a state of confusion).Ideas, irrespective of the truth in them, can unleash power.  In this world, power and ideas very much go together.  Look at the history of Islam as one prime example of this.  It exploded on the world, and it‚Äôs still here and quite strong well over 1 millennium later.  This is because it was/is a propitious system of ideas for its time and place.

        Yet this True Conservatism end times grift has been a boom for French, no? Who knew of him prior to his narcissistic posturing on behalf of the infallible faith of Never Trump? Hell, this Muslim convert to weak Christian dissident may have gotten a cut for taking the fall.
Someone from Conservatism, Inc., had to suck the last dollar out of the dwindling faithful. It seems fitting that French, with his warmongering Elmer Gantry act, could be that man.

        It‚Äôs probably true that a ‚Äúmilitant, optimistic and aggressive Christianity‚Äù would be an effective force against the Left. It‚Äôs certainly worked for Muslims, and to a degree it‚Äôs working today for conservative Christians in America, who seem to be having more success in defending their values against the Progressive onslaught than anybody else.The problems though is that in order to recruit all those disaffected white youth to the cause you have to be able to make a decent argument that Christianity (or any religion) is‚Ä¶, um‚Ä¶, actuallytrue, and as far as I can see no such argument exists. The Muslims solve this problem by keeping their youth ignorant and credibly threatening to kill anyone who tries to expose them to the counterarguments against religion. But that option is only open to you if youalreadyare in a position of power.And frankly I‚Äôm not sure it would do any good. There is nothing in Christianity that even suggests one should care about race, and a great deal that says we are all of us brothers. Even more frankly, if I was convinced that there was a world beyond this one where everyone was going to live forever, then why would I care if this world goes to hell? Seriously, why would it matter? Theonlyreason I care about what happens in this world is because I believe it‚Äôs the only world there is!

            The Bible openly acknowledges and approves of the existence and separation of races. This theme is acknowledged casually throughout the entire Bible.
Most Christian thinkers are willing to stand behind historical evidence for claims of Jesus‚Äô divinity. SeeEvidence That Demands A Verdict.
I made exactly the same argument you did in your last sentence when I was a young, college freshman atheist. Hopefully you will also realize how wrong you are.

                I‚Äôm pretty sure the Bible never makes a big deal out of the existence of races, but I would be open to seeing quotes that suggested otherwise. In any case though, I am quite sure that the ‚Äúlove thy neighbor‚Äù theme in the New Testament is much stronger than anything having to do with race.And as far as arguments for the truth of Christianity, I‚Äôve been listening to such arguments for decades and have never heard anything remotely persuasive. All of those arguments demanded that I give more credence to a handful of 2000 year old texts of uncertain provenience than I would give to this morning‚Äôs New York Times. Why would I ever do that? If I don‚Äôt trust the Times (and I don‚Äôt), why would I trust the Gospels, when I know so much less about their authors and the circumstances under which they were written?

            I wonder to what extent the underclass has been further demoralized by globalism, mass immigration and the welfare state?  (Along with the general societal break-down.)

        French hammered Sohrab with the question, ‚ÄúWhat legal tools would you use to oppose drag queen story hour?‚Äù and Sohrab had no answer.
French is correct when he said that if we want to preserve our vast, multi-racial and multi-faith country, then we can‚Äôt weaponize the judiciary because it will be used against us.  Which is already what is happening.
The only answer to French‚Äôs statement is to deny the ‚Äúif‚Äù part of his conditional.

            As I wrote, French only agreed to do this because he knew the Persian was a light weight. Ross Dualtwat was there to make sure it was going to be the David French show.

            Which legal tools. Hmm.Has to be a male librarian in his 50s or 60s somewhere in the midwest who‚Äôs willing to start purchasing and stocking dissident right books (I‚Äôm spitballing here, be charitable) such as BAP‚Äôs Bronze Age Mindset.Sit back, watch how he is attacked, defunded, and removed from his job ‚Äî all legally. Take notes.Would this have been so difficult to come up with on the spot? Might not work, but if nothing else, the way out might be the same path as the way in ‚Äî or as Heraclitus said, the way up is the way down. Use the same legal tools they use. Or at least give it a shot to determine what‚Äôs possible, and what is not. This one‚Äôs probably in the latter category.And it is good that it is. French, of course, is all about the ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù Never the political. But it is the political ‚Äî polemos ‚Äî that will be the way out of this. We may not live to see it. It will involve struggle, not footnotes in law review articles or dozens of city council struggle sessions over ‚Äúthe children‚Äù and public libraries ‚Äî now nothing more than banks of computers, anyway, in most places.

            No need to down vote a reasoned comment made in good faith.  However, you are simply wrong and have not thought all of your points through.  The Founders were indeed the natural aristocracy, but far from modern plutocrats.  All the evidence needed for this statement is found in the model of government they chose and the models of government then in current use they could have chosen.

        ‚ÄúImagine young guys in camo flash mobbing public events, while reading Scripture.‚ÄùI can imagine such an occurrence but I KNOW that it would not only NOT be a Christian act but it would unquestionably be an UNCHRISTIAN act. Such confrontational tactics directly contravene direct orders from the Creator.In Romans 12:18, The Creator, speaking through the Apostle Paul, commanded, ‚ÄúIf possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.‚ÄùAgain in First Peter 3:15-16, The Creator, speaking through the Apostle Peter commanded, ‚ÄúAlways be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.‚ÄùSo, you see, an action such as you describe could only be perpetrated by scripturally ignorant or willfully disobedient ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù.

                Carl B, I don‚Äôt know about anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúhollow self-righteousness‚Äù; nor do I really care. I certainly belong to neither the ‚ÄúPrincipled Conservative‚Äù camp nor the ‚ÄúEvangelical Christian‚Äù one. All I know is what was delivered to in the Bible as we have it. In both cases we have what (at least some believe to be) are direct orders from The Creator of the universe. After 4 solid semesters of NT (Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩŒµ ‚ÄúKoine‚Äù) Greek I can confidently assert that the verbs in both selections are in imperative mood and thus are COMMANDS; as opposed to mere suggestions. I also know that forgiveness is impossible without repentance which is utterly at odds with deliberate disobedience. What you or anyone does with respect to Christian scripture is totally between them and ultimate reality however they conceive/consider him/her/it to be.

                Jesus was the Son Of God, Z. He also famously said, ‚ÄúRender unto Ceasar‚Ä¶.‚Äù I am only the merest outhouse Christian and I can swap Scripture with you all day long. Sorry, Bill is largely correct. There are no real biblical grounds for something like that save for a direct command from God himself.For me, for now, it is enough to render unto Ceasar, but I will not bow down to him. If my enemies choose violence against me on that context, the gloves come off and the guns come out and no bones about it ‚Äì God can sort out the bodies afterward.As I said elsewhere, Z ‚Äì the Christians will not be goaded into doing your dirty work for you. Until you are prepared to enter the public space, with your real name and real identity ‚Äì you can‚Äôt ask me to. I don‚Äôt like any of this either ‚Äì but we are in this together, or we aren‚Äôt.

            We can not win by allowing our virtues to be used as a weapon against us.  The tactics and rules of the conflict are to a great extent set by our enemies.  Whatever tactics were laid out by Paul were for a time and place and situation long past.  Indeed, the Christian Church would not have been expanded to its current extent were it not for conflict and struggle.
The discussion on the table now is not one of expansion, but one of survival.  Chose your course of action wisely.

            If people followed Christianity this way it would died soon after Jesus did. Because those passages turn Christianity into a suicide cult.
Charles Martel would not have been able to fight the Saracens at Tours or those other Christian soldiers who fought over the centuries to protect their lands from the Saracens.
