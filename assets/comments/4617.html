        […] When I was writing this post a couple of weeks back, I had a section on how much I despised Donald trump. But, the post got too long so I cut it out. He’s one of those people that I heard speak a few sentences and decided I did not like. That was back in the 1980’s when he was peddling himself as a master negotiator. One of my friends read his book and thought it must be some sort of gag because Trump’s advice was ridiculous. […]

        All the ‘alarm bells’ you experience with Newt and Ann are the same ones you get when dealing with car salesmen. For much the same reasons.

        I despise the Clintons, Gore, Kerry and their minions because they are prototypical baby boomer hypocrites, hiding behind a faux piety while stealing all they can, lying impulsively and living wretched lives.I am biased but I believe the best of my generation are those of us who put in a year in War Zone C or on the DMZ (obviously there are exceptions). The above mentioned stooges were big men on campus, those who embraced the anti-American agitprop of    Alinsky and Herbert Marcuse and ghetto pseudo revolutionaries like Huey Newton and Stokely Carmichael. The damage their ideas have done to our country are immeasurable.I think we need a generational change with new leaders with new ideas. Hillary can and probably will go to hell soon enough.

        I’ve always liked Coulter. She’s smart, stays on point, is un-PC, and says things you wish elected officials had the balls to say. And she drives the Leftists wild, which is extra bonus points for her.

        I once did some recruiting for a certain institution.A mentor of mine told me to always put my effort into the regular guys and steer the weirdos away from the prize.  It was very good advice.The Ivies and the Seven Sisters once served to screen out the bitter wierdos.Not a new observation of mine, but one which seems to dovetail nicely with your theory:  we seem to have lost that ability as a society.  The debate club and the band kids have taken over the polity and many of our institutions.  I see this again and again.  Someone who is still pissed and bitter from getting picked on in high school by the jocks and cheerleaders takes it out on the same when given the opportunity and power.  They will continue to attack institutions like Scouting, football, Marine infantry officer training, and Ranger school until either they are gone or they can pass them, hopefully after a few seminars and maybe a day or two of paintball and adventure training.

        All my adult life I’ve been attracted to people who are plainspoken. I’m repelled by people who are artful in any way, respectable or disrespectable. Probably comes from the many years in the cockpit where everybody is upfront and brief about everything. You have to be to survive.
