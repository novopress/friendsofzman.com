        Obvious parallels to Orwell’s 1984 – “She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her.”  Also Theodore Dalrymple’s observation about communist societies – “In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is…in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.”

            To successfully pass on a lie, especially when everyone involved knows it is a lie, is a demonstration of power.  When a turkey sandwich is ordered, and then sent back because it was not what was ordered, it has nothing to do with turkey or sandwiches.  It has everything to do with “I am the boss of you, and you will submit to my bald-faced lie as a demonstration of my power”.  I wonder if the video maker and Benghazi has that element going for it.

                Without a doubt – Clinton, Obama and Rice had the gall to blame the video for the Benghazi attacks to the families of those killed.

                It’s also gaslighting, which of course over time is intended to make the other side feel insane and ultimately question their own ability to observe reality.  It’s why “the media” complicit with all the Leftist and Progressive deception, fraud and corruption is actually ‘at war’ with and enemies of the public.  They violate the public trust in a very tangible way.  They deserve to waterboarded and hanged publicly.

            I am with you 100%. I keep saying that the whole deal with trans-everything is simply a mind experiment. If they can get people to actually “believe” that the most obvious physical reality is not real, they can force you to believe just about anything. The whole time, the puppet masters are laughing their asses off watching the politicians pandering to the pronouns and any other random thought experiment is next. It is frightening to watch seemingly intelligent people swear against the obvious.I often think of the end game, when they have finally turned the entire country into Mexico, and more specifically Tijuana, Will they then come to believe they were wrong? Never ! They will be denying the most obvious basic realities, and blaming everything on us, if nothing else simply for our thoughts or opinions. It is simply about submission.

                Frank, the English translation of “Islam” is “submission”.  It’s all one big circle of deceit.

            That came up today at Fordham, where faculty is now REQUIRED to address students by their “preferred gender”, not their actual sex.
No surprise that it’s a Jesuit institution; it would be worth the price of admission to see what Vince Lombardi would do to the President of that outfit were he to come back to his alma mater today.

        Yes, Progressives are becoming increasingly blatant and bold in their behaviors. The election fraud currently being committed is shamelessly taking place out in the open in broad daylight with no reservation or remorse. As bad as that is, it is even more absurd that there are no adults in the room to remedy the situation. That strongly suggests that the fraud was preplanned, authorized, orchestrated, and implemented by the DC powerbrokers and their henchmen. The only silverlining to this travesty is that a lot of Americans are now becoming aware that the rule of law is dead in the US.

        At this point elections are just elaborate lies.
34 elections so far that Republicans were winning on election night – that flipped for Democrats after ballots were conveniently found.  Now we are supposed to pretend to believe they are valid for 2 years?  And believe that this wasn’t just a rehearsal for a bigger fraud in 2020?

                    All that this most current round of Leftist fraud proves is something most of us already knew – that we’re not going to be able to vote ourselves out of this.
The crucial importance of this is that now the normies are learning it, too. Interesting times ahead.

                        I think you are overestimating the “normies”. Most do not seem even vaguely alarmed. Start talking about voter fraud, population replacement,  or even an immigration shutdown, most of them will look at you like you have grown a 2nd head.
I don’t know at what percentage we reach a tipping point, but it seems like we are really far from it right now.

                            This is why I think the right really needs to come to grip with the fact that they’re going to have to play a little dirty.For instance:  have you ever read how radical groups get more converts to their side?  They do things like take young impressionable wannabes,  take them out to a protest – and put them out in front with a sign in their hands.When the cops show up and beat the hell out of them, gas them – and chuck them in jail ,  the old hands go bail them out , and then fill their heads with all sorts of images of how bad the cops are and how bad “regular society ” – because that’s who the cops protect.Now imagine if you can some how get Antifah to go down to a local mall at Christmas time – and run rampant thru the place knocking out Ma and Pa Kettle and smacking little white kids around.SOMEBODY is going to put that shit on the news.The other thing to keep in mind is:  people change their minds in increments.  Even some of the worst soccer dad types I have worked with – took notice of some of the crazy shit going on out there.  Now they might not fully understand the details of what is going on – but they know *something * is happening.I got into a big argument with a co-worker last year over some of the crap that BLM was screaming about – – because he made some comment about “what’s with all the rioting?”.I told him about the Trayvon Martin thing,  how BLM was full of shit – and that is what set him off.  That’s because all the churches around here had big BLM banners on their front lawns.  Plus his wife is Jewish – and I’m sure gets a heaping dose of leftist bullshit down at the local temple.  The thing is this – while he was getting all pissed off at what I told him – another coworker slid over and told him I was basically right.That definitely calmed him down – and gave him something to think about.When you see a crack – no matter how small – drive in the wedge.

            I tell my normie friends that I am done with elections. If my side is far ahead, my vote doesn’t matter.  If the other side is far ahead, my vote doesn’t matter.  If it is close, the other side will cheat to the point where my vote doesn’t matter.  They can’t wrap their heads around my argument—so far.

            I’m afraid the implications of the 2018 election are devastating for Trump. He’s now a lame duck President almost certain to lose in 2020. The felon vote in Florida will turn the state blue. Trump can’t win without Florida. In two more years Georgia and Arizona may well be blue states, particularly when you factor in election fraud.The Trump agenda is dead in the water. He’ll spend the next two years trying to fight off impeachment from the House, and will get no help from the GOPe. He will become a non-entity in Washington.Trump’s fatal mistake was appointing Jeff Sessions as the Attorney General. I am completely convinced that Sessions was a mole deliberately planted by the GOPe to undermine the Trump Presidency by unnecessarily recusing himself from supervising the Mueller investigation. The final tell is in the first three words of Sessions’ resignation letter, “[a]t your request.” This parting shot against Trump was an open invitation to opponents to challenge Trump’s appointment of Matt Whitaker, which they have done.I hope Sessions suffers a slow, painful death and then rots in Hell.

                I concur. I think Mr. Trump has been painted into a corner, largely by his own party. In the midst of all this blatant election fraud, he has been tweeting about the French. I admire the guy enormously for what he has achieved but it was always too big a task for one man without any real allies.

                    Trump never had a chance of saving the US, that ship sailed almost 20 years ago. His historical role is to usher in the phase that will lead to division of the US into multiple countries. For that, he is doing an admirable job, even though it’s the last thing in the world he wants.

                        There is not going to be a partition of the US into multiple countries in the lifetime of anyone reading this. If Trump loses in 2020 the left will be firmly in control of the Presidency and the House, probably permanently. The Senate will likely remain in Republican control, but GOPe Senators will happily cave in to any demands from the left in exchange for a slight reduction in the top marginal tax rate or some such trivial exchange.
If the dollar collapses as the reserve currency then all bets are off, but we’re a long way from that event.

                            The partition of the U.S. may not appear likely now, but I remember when the Soviet Union seemed eternal.  Things change slowly, then all at once.  I agree that Trump’s re-election is highly unlikely but the Left is anything but unified, except in its dislike of white people, especially men.  When they take power, the infighting may be more vicious than what’s being directed against the opposition.

                        The USA won’t break up while the US Military is dominant and there’s no sign of that fading away.The Orange Buffoon is now free to switch into full RINO mode all the while blaming it on the Democrat control of the House.  The Wall was an empty promise for childish minds.  He added insult to injury by claiming he was going to end birthright citizenship by EO before the elections, of course that will never happen.The betrayal will be obvious when the Democrat gun bans mysteriously manage to make their way past the Republican Senate and Supremes impeded only by furious hand waving.

        A fascinating dichotomy between liars and Truth-tellers: The liar needs the liar in order to spread the lie, so they employ whatever means necessary to spread it. The Truth-teller has no such compulsion. It is not a hindrance to the truth to die for the truth, because if it is the truth, it doesn’t need us to spread it.Christianity says not to deny God, even in the face of persecution, while Islam says its ok to lie to avoid death. Christianity relies on God to spread his words, while we are merely tools. Islam’s sole mechanism of spreading is through its people.The philosophies are interesting in their differences.

                There are going to be a portion of the population that cannot and will not see the truth. There will be a very small select who know the truth but rebel against it.
There is also a segment of the population who will see the truth and already know the truth.
When you insert “Christ” for “Truth”, it should bring some comfort. Truth wins in the end.

                    Christ already did that:  “I am the Way, Truth, Life.”  Add Aristotle’s dictum, and “Truth, Beauty, Goodness, Way, and Life” are equivalences.
That should give one the proper perspective on those who war against the truth.  It is not a co-incidence that they also war against Life, Beauty, and Goodness.

        I hate to be Debbie Downer, but reality is a cold-hearted witch. The plain fact is there is NO solution to the problem we face. Once the lies are now regarded as hard truths by a significant amount of the population with no ability to rebut it in this communications blackout against non-progressive thought, and creating votes out of “intent” to vote from provisional votes that have no chain of custody, the United States is doomed as a Constitutional Republic. In fact, these are darker days than at ANY time in this country’s history, because of our inability to counter this threat. The 2nd Amendment was meant to repel a government spiraling out of control within the confines of our known people, but trying to fight off half the population, augmented by virtually EVERY other country’s population is not going to end well. Kinetic action has pragmatically been deemed a non-solution since the 60’s in any case.In short, for the first time I do not see Donald Trump even having a chance in 2020. The Left was caught flat-footed in 2016, including social media, which has now supplanted the mainstream media, whom are now nothing but PR for the cray-cray loonytunes wing of the Democrat Party. But with their ascendancy in control of the Internet, and with the demographics of non-assimilated legal immigrants and illegal alien invaders that are &gt;95% communist Democrat, I do not see a valid solution out of the morass. Even when the rapid decline of the economy hits and many people say, “What have we done!”, it will be too late to reverse the course.The bottom line: The GOP will lose the presidency, and probably the Senate, in 2020, the House will solidify to the Ocasio-Cortez loonytoon wing of the Democrat Party, and by 2024, many Red states will have turned blue. Most probably an economic downturn will have to have happened, and the Democrats will solidify the permanent destruction of the energy sector, permanent 70% tax across the board, and solidify a constant flow of invaders from South America, Africa, the Middle East, and select south Asian countries. Finally, granting them instant citizenship with proxy voting methodologies voted on by Congress will signify the end of the constitutional Republic, with the Constitution itself in the crosshairs, but effectively nullified nonetheless.I WISH kinetic response was an option, for I see no way out of doing this the democratic (small d) way. Pure and simple.Someone, prove me wrong, please. I fear it is impossible at this point.Article cited:http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/3705467/posts

                Without whitey there’s no civilization, but whitey just won’t get with the program (pogrom). Do they honestly believe that they can make women engineers or Africans physicists? The majority of the minority cannot have quite swallowed this lie, so what we have to assume that this minority of the population has decided that they would rather have control than have civilization. The problem is that civilization is the marginal minority’s method of control. It’s a loop that not even Stalin could escape for long.

WW1 “saved” the West?
Pat Buchanan would completely disagree.
Marxism was loosed on the world by the insanity the West plunged into during WW1.
This guy is a perfect example of ability to do root cause analysis among many conservatives I run into.
Most lefties are COMPLETELY unable to do it – but I call out conservatives because they are *supposed to be* different from the lefties.

            When the time comes, you’ll be surprised at the allies we have. The Globalist elite is hated by the common people of almost every country on Earth. In retrospect, people will say that their fall was inevitable.
I remember when the USSR looked unbeatable too. Courage. Despair is a sin, and a bad policy as well.

        “The result is an intellectual movement that celebrates complex dishonesty and fabrication for no purpose other than for aesthetics.”
Ah, but that course of action is only for the present time. When the left feels it has complete electoral and bureaucratic control, they will jettison this device. The aesthetics of universal, lunatic, leftist outrage will be replaced with the serene, bureaucratic tactics of the silent, unseen hunter. And we all know who will become the prey.

        “Invasive species are a danger because the ecosystem they invade is not prepared to deal with the foreign threat.”There is no race or “culture” as capable of extreme methodical violence as the “Western Liberal Tradition”.  I remember arguing with a friend during the sudden drama over water boarding and how “that’s not who we are”. Really dumbass, not who we are? Waterboarding is the kiddy pool compared to who we are. The left has forgotten this. What happens when the debt bubble pops and the average person has nothing left to lose?

            Indeed, Frey Tomas de Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition, introduced water boarding as a less injurious mitigation of previously employed “truth seeking” procedures such as the rack, which often led to the permanent disability or death of the confessed penitent.  Water boarding was employed because it induced great psychological fear but rarely resulted in physical injury.  Of course whether the Spanish Inqusition was aware of PTSD is unrecorded history.The West knows how to project power in the service of culture.

            You know where waterboarding came from? It came from the military course on being a POW. They would subject  special ops soldiers and pilots to waterboarding to give them a taste  of interrogation.
Of course the Lefrards complaining about it never tell us that or the fact that our enemies, use power drills, acid and old fashioned beatings among other techniques on our people and then kill them. Generally they don’t take prisoners.

            While the Free Stuff and easy living continues, Whitey just wants to get along.  White men self-organize well, now to keep things running.
When the trucks stop running, everyone tribes up and starts gathering territory and supply. This means killing off other accessible tribes who are eating our food/squatting on our frontier. The rule is always “Me, Mine”.  Sure, the victorious tribe will have sympathy for their surviving compliant young women now that they need men and leadership/protection.There will be blood.

            Millions of white leftists are convinced that Theresa May is an irredeemable racist, in spite of the fact that the Conservative Party has engaged in rampant affirmative action. If people are willing to believe that about May, just imagine what they think about Trump.Anglos are particularly susceptible to “sportsmanship” claims, and the belief that certain groups are “historical victims” that must be “graded on a curve”. A complaint about fraud, is worse than fraud itself, because it causes people to recognize that blacks are tolerant of corruption. White liberals vacillate between The Procedure and No Place for Racists. Had it been up to them DeSantis would have been disqualified by a Human Rights Commission the moment he said “monkey”.

            I propose a new elaboration of the bracket system which everyone realizes signals nothing.  Since there are many persons of mixed ethnicity who also practice tribal loyalty yet may not merit full brackets, I would suggest diluting the brackets according to the genetic dilution.  This has added information content. Observe:  ((Michael Cohen), to signify an individual with a (((father))), but (John Smith)) to indicate a (((mother))).  I realize this would break down for individuals with two fathers or two mothers.  😉

        The division of left and right now largely maps onto the division of the unprincipled and the principled, the sociopaths and the non-sociopaths.If “principledness” is one bell curve, with sociopathic killers on the far left, and the unfailingly decent on the far right, then you could say that the political left, by its very nature, attracts more people from the left side of that curve, and the political right more people from the right side of the curve.Thus we’ve separated out two curves representing the two political camps, overlapping to be sure, but one with a bulge on the left, the other on the right. It’s a way to visualize how the left has a lot more liars and sociopaths than we do. As Zman’s post suggests, they’ve got a lot of guys who probably justlikelying. And as many d-right commentators have pointed out, a lot of people on the left justlikemayhem, disorder, and thuggery.The problem–I call it “the Principles Problem”–is that Evil is stronger than Good. Precisely because evil is not weighed down by principles and scruples, it’s more likely to win. And after it wins Evil can rewrite history to make itself look like the Good. That is our baleful situation.***In simpler terms, we’re just entering a straight-up emperor’s-new-clothes situation, where the powers that be can just roll out one huge, whopping lie after another, simply because they nobody dares contradict them openly. That explains the left’s frenzy about people like Trump and Tucker Carlson, who are like the kids in the emperor story.

            One of the arguably unfortunate aspects of reality is that Good may have to adopt some of the tactics of Evil (such as selective deception) to ultimately prevail. My suspicion is that leftists break down mostly into two groups: those who are power-hungry simply for the sake of power (minority) and those who are personally disillusioned but blame their dysfunction/low self esteem on society so that they can avoid a potentially painful self-examination (majority). Members of the former group prefer mayhem because it provides them an excuse to expand their power. Members of the latter group prefer mayhem for reasons of vengeance, i.e. wishing for an “unjust” society to suffer. A little bit of amateur psychologizing on my part here. Nevertheless, it strikes me as likely from everything I have seen.

            Why did they lack those antibodies?  Perhaps their first principles were faulty, perhaps their conceptions of good and evil were faulty.  Where do we trace those?  Can a portion of the West slip out of this epically insane clustf*ck without having to extricate a critical mass of whites from these first principles?  I don’t know.

        Credit where due. The Left seized control of the very institutions that determine what words mean first and then redefined words to suit their mission. When you can change a word like “racism” from holding animus toward another person because of their race into simply being white as sufficient evidence of racism, it makes the propaganda war easier. Who is going to correct them? The media? The “education” establishment? Of course not. The subversion of the institutions is the greatest enabler of what you are describing in this post. Little wonder no one trusts the institutions that were once considered to be the centers of truth. All that is left in the West now institutionally is the church and even that is quickly falling under the spell of the Cultural Marxists, and not just in liberal denominations.

        America as the currently-understood political entity we now inhabit is effectively at an end.  The now-Khmer Rouge legislature, which has openly stolen dozens of seats through the most patently ludicrous criminal fraud, and is fighting to fraudulently claim two governorships, has effectively declared open war on a duly and fairly elected sitting president simply for the crime of having been duly elected and being Not One Of Theirs.  No other charge is even remotely believeable.  Donald Trump is illegitimate because he spoke ( and only spoke, mind you; the man has done zero regarding his mandated agenda) on behalf of Actual Americans.This is a coup.  This is a nullification of two national elections in a row: a flat out militarized refusal to abide by the outcomes of the ostensibly legitimate system.  It is the Democrats who have ended democracy in America, and for good — you’re watching it happen right now, this week.  Make a note in your diary or something.Legitimacy of the Khmer Rouge regime is neither credible nor possible.  In 2020 Trump will be in an impossible position: on the one hand he cannot win, it is no longer possible.  On the other hand, he cannot peaceably relinquish power to observable genocidal maniacs.Even if it were not that dire (but it is), from a practical perspective it is simply impossible to share the same political breathing space with people who believe in talking octopuses and bananas that can do card tricks.  Sane people cannot consent to live under the permanent boot-heel of the criminally insane.The future of Whites in the presently-understood United States is now over.  But the future of Whites in North America is very robust indeed, long term.  We can only thrive by dwelling apart from these murdering psychopaths.Going forward, Partition is the only realistic thing worth discussing.  And in Realpolitik terms, in order to achieve Partition without a bloody civil war (unlikely but still doable), Partition will require, on our side, a diplomatic alliance with White, Christian, nuclear-armed Russia as guarantor.  And the (((vampire squids))) know it, which is why (((They’ve))) been so hell – bent on demonizing, weakening, and isolating Russia.Get out those maps, those slide rules, and those Russian grammar books.  There’s a ton of work to be done.

            No way in hell is partition going to happen unless both sides are bled dry. The Left can’t give up the wealth the rest of the country has nor its desire for control and the Right can’t afford the security risk of Left wing states hiring foreign troops  to wage war on them in perpetuity.It has to be one or another. My money is on the Left though as the Right is leaderless, incapable of any sort of collective action or of forming an ideology and won’t rule with a iron hand or at all.You can’t run from power, you run to it and once you get it, you fight to keep it. People  that think collective is a swear word, can’t even utter the word social contract without melting down and is atomized is utterly useless.Its an evolutionary dead end and deserves what it getsAs Franklin saidWe must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separatelyAnd not to put too fine a point on it, Y/T is not capable of doing this at least right now/And as far as they great White killing power, its almost always been against his own brethren. Basically Y/T is great at fratricide and  wiping out very weak enemies and not actually better at war than anyone else.

        The recent “performance art” by that carbuncle Jim Acosta is a trivial, but highly publicized, example of such lying. Rather than ask a question, he simply insisted that, against all evidence, the president agree with him that the dusky hoard heading our way from the south is NOT an invasion.As we know, we’re all supposed to trust Google to lead us toward the light and away from darkness, so I Googled “invasion,” and here the definition that came up: “an incursion by a large number of people or things into a place or sphere of activity,” and, “an unwelcome intrusion into another’s domain.” Google defines  “intrude” as “[to] put oneself deliberately into a place or situation where one is unwelcome or uninvited.” Google defines “invade” as follows: “[to] enter (a place, situation, or sphere of activity) in large numbers, especially with intrusive effect,” and it defines “intrusive” as “causing disruption or annoyance through being unwelcome or uninvited.”“When YOU use a word” Jim ‘Humpty Dumpty’ Acosta said, in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.”The most frustrating thing to me about this is that, as far as I can tell, no one, even on the right, has pointed out the obvious lie at the heart of his “question”…

            A while ago I read something about Russia becoming the savior of Europe – as it would go to war with the rest of Europe and kick out the Islamic invaders.If Macron &amp; Merkel put together a “European Army” – and use it to go after Poland, Hungary, Italy and Switzerland – maybe this solution is actually coming to fruition.Russia allies with Poland, Hungary, Italy and Switzerland (probably throw a few other random countries in there as well) – and then crushes the rest of Europe and throws out the Muslim invaders.The real question is: whose side does the US stand on?

        Happened to see Wax speak after getting an award earlier this year and she addressed this issue.   What was even more Orwellian is that the Penn Law administration told her she was wrong about the class rankings despite the fact that she oversaw the the summer associate and clerkship process for years and had both access to the data and intimate familiarity with the “profiles” of all the students.  She knows that and the administration knows that…yet the Kabuki theater continues.

        There is only one solution at this point.  They have to be taken out en masse.  Today, too few will risk giving up their bread and circuses to carry this out.  Thus, unless real, extended privation occurs, probably brought on by an economic collapse, we’ll continue on the present path to the Marxist paradise.  Hope we can get good sushi in the camps.

        Our side practices high level deception against us as well.  In an effort to remove “hate” from my life and become normie, I have started to read magazine rack conservative publications, such as national review, weekly standard, commentary, and chronicles.  In this months issue of chronicles, there is a lengthy article discussing the necessity of immigrants speaking English and the danger of Spanish speaking conclaves.  The author is chosen to have an obviously Hispanic name.  Ben franklins hostility to German speaking immigrants is expounded, as if to imply there is no difference between Germans and Mexicans.  All we need to do is get them speaking English and it will all be hunky dory!  It’s such a red herring of a political topic, artificed to redirect conservatives’ angst at being overwhelmed by third world immigrants into a nothing issue of whether they speak English or not!  It’s to give conservative whites a pc talking point that redirects their anger into a made up,straw man issue that will have no real world impact at all.  All young people will learn to speak English and assimilate to the dominant culture from the tv, there’s no problem there—but that’s what I’m afraid of!

            It doesn’t help to have people like Ron Unz on “our” side, acting as if the leftist drive to import more immigrants has something to do with concern with the wellbeing of the immigrants themselves, instead of creating a bought and paid for vote bank. If Mexicans voted 60% Republican instead of Democrat, we’d have a100-foot wall topped with razor wire and automatic machine guns on the southern border, and everybody knows it – except normie-cons like Unz.

                You’re ignorant if you don’t think that there’s  a significant amount of people that excuse away their support of importing immigrants by telling themselves that they’re good people for letting them all come in and become “Americans”.The way you short circuit these people is by detailing the ways in which their support is actually harming people.  I’ve seen it happen right in front of my face.  It’s how you separate the good hearted from the truly evil.  Because the truly evil will just double down and resort to whatever arguments they think will support their position.The people who *think* they’re good-hearted will say “oh shit – I didn’t think of that ”  – when you lay out details of how unfettered immigration destroys everything.

        Another reason for the change is that, if all is lies and fakery, doing things for logical reasons is meaningless.Rather than give a reason for your actions, when questioned, you simply reply: “Why, no, I didn’t say or do that! YOU must be the mistaken one! Or, more likely, EVIL! Shame on you for your refusal to remember the ‘right’ things”.

            Robinson is a proxy of the Security Service (MI5), almost certainly controlled opposition. The vast majority of the UK hates him, seeing him as a leader of drunken football hooligans. He’s someone best cast over the side.

                He is hated by the majority of the elite whose opinion is the only one represented by the trash media in the UK. Don’t assume he’s hated by everyone else;if he was the BBC et al. would not spend so much time telling every Briton that they must hate him.
There’s no evidence that he’s an MI5 asset or that he’s seen as a drunken hooligan. However, there’s plenty of evidence that you don’t have a clue when you talk about the UK.

                    I invite you to take a look into what MI5 have done in the UK, and what the FBI has done in the US. Robinson himself admitted in his book that he was recruited by the regular police to be an informant in Jayda Fransen’s other organization. He says he turned them down. MI5 has admitted that they consider the far-right to be the biggest security threat. Starting, and then bailing, on the EDL suggests a honeypot operation. Robinson isn’t a drunk, but many of his followers are.

        In re: the lies of the Clintons. Bill does it to cover up his nefarious acts and intentions , but Hillary is a different case. I was reminded of the Dalrymple quote on Russian propaganda, “In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, nor to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is to co-operate with evil, and in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed.”

        Socrates and Cicero were not white and the study of Greek and Roman antiquity is inherently racist, says deranged virtue-signaling proggy catlady professor.  Her solution:  deny history and substitute an imaginary diversity:https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/himmlers-antiquity/The proggy prof is launched on her mission to obliterate the past because of deep concern that “alt-right” types have taken up classical civilization as an exemplar of the sublime achievements of white men.  What proggy prof doesn’t bother to ask herself in her zeal is what kind of achievements are possible by people who live in a wholly imaginary world because reality is always hurting their fragile feelings?(And yes, catlady professor outs herself as a “cat enthusiast” on her twitter page:https://twitter.com/actraweek?lang=enIf we’re to be denied truth elsewhere, we can at least have it confirmed by stereotypes.)

I think it’s calculated too. Along the lines of Obama’s, You didn’t build that. Denigrating white men’s acheivements by making Hamilton, Greeks, etc. black they can create a golden age of diversity compared to the racist, sexist present; and allow people like the professor to advance by means of more special treatment. In other words, it’s an elaborate rationale for more concessions from white men.

        Czelaw Milosz, inThe Captive Mind,called it “ketman” — not just lying, or even lying for the sake of lying, but taking pride in how skillfully one lies, and how big a lie one can get someone else to (apparently) swallow.  He said dissidents did it in Communist countries, and warned that, functionally, it’s the same as Communism — the dissident in his own mind is uttering a damning critique of Communism, but because it’s cloaked in so many lies, and because he’s so proud of the subtlety of his lies, he is in effect just parroting the party line.  I did the same thing in academia for years, and one of the big reasons I retired early was because I realized students weren’t in on the joke.  When they put in my reviews that I sounded like a hippie Marxist lunatic, they weren’t winking at me — they really thought I was a hippie Marxist lunatic.  I thought I was being so over-the-top that they couldn’t possibly miss the satire — my ketman, my pride in my skillful lies, made me forget all about Poe’s Law.

        The only part of this that I take issue with is at the very end, where you refer to the Frankfurt School as an invasive species in the west. Maybe in a very technical sense it is not “native” – if you consider Hungary to be “oriental” – but in any case it’s merely a mutation of the original invasive species introduced to the world BY the west, that being liberal democracy (AKA communism) itself. That’s why any non-western country that absorbs the latter is destroyed almost instantly.The west, and America in particular, has only itself to blame. If it hadn’t exported its cancerous ideology to the rest of the world, then the mutant Cult-Marx form would never have existed.

            Re:  “liberal democracy”.The United States at least – was NOT setup as a “liberal democracy”.It was setup as a Republic.  The whole “democracy” thing is something that has been foisted upon us by the marxist left as a way station on the road to communism.The Wiki entry is instructive – because it’s first paragraphs include the US,  but fail to make the distinction that the US was setup as a Republic and DID NOT HAVE “universal suffrage”.Most of the founders of this country warned against “democracy”.The fact that people on the right cannot seem to get this straight – and constantly reiterate the historical fallacy constantly spewed out by the left – is yet another one of those instances where it appears many on the right simply have no ability to do cause and effect analysis.If you don’t understand the problem there’s no way in hell you’re ever going to fix it.Zman’s column was about lying.  Let’s stop lying about the roots of the nation that was formed here when the colonists revolted against the English Crown as a good place to start.

                Republic is a form of democracy. It decays into universal-suffrage democracy at a half-life of about 100 years.
The “muh republic” argument is a staple of boomer conservatism, like “free trade” or “DR3”. The left doesn’t care, and the reactionary right knows better.
America has been explicitly communist since the early 1900s, and from the late 18th century onward was clearly in love with revolutionary democracy. “No taxation without representation!” What do you think that statement is conveying?

        But about judaism we learn from this:
http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/hf_LyingPermissible.html
“Thus, there are several circumstances where one is permitted or sometimes required to lie:
Lying to preserve the cause of peace, not to hurt another person’s feelings, or to provide comfort.
Lying in a situation where honesty might cause oneself or another person harm.
Lying for the sake of modesty or in order not to appear arrogant.
Lying for the sake of decency, i.e., not telling the truth about intimate matters.
Lying to protect one’s property from scoundrels.”
In other words, when it’s beneficial to the Jew.

            I’m having trouble seeing why these are bad reasons to lie or that any of these things are opposed by or against the common culture  of the West.Most of this reminds me of Scandinavian Jante LawComplete honesty is Facebook autism and leads to endless social conflict. Or has House says “everybody lies”thank goodness for that.Of course maybe this reaction is because I’m tired of hearing about high trust the West was. That is  bullshit  that people believe to be true.We are more trustworthy now do to the administrative state and effective incarceration. Maybe peoples west of the Hajinal line are less tribal and ,more individualistic than other groups but they aren’t more honest.if they were we would never have needed the pure food and drug act or any of the trappings of a complex society

        I think part of the left’s willingness to spread falsehood is based in opportunism, wishing to rise in social status via public adherence to the new faith, part rooted in evolutionary psychology, as those who do not meld with the group tend be weak and exposed, and thus fail to pass on their genes, part a wish to identify themselves with the “smart and accomplished”, the elite in the Ivory Tower and such, and part desire to be on the right side of our hegemonic definition of Good versus Evil, and to believe in a coming universalist egalitarian utopia.Related to this last point, I was a very devoted traditional Catholic for a long period of time, and still enjoy reading theological debates between extremely intelligent, well-read traditional Catholics.  These same extremely intelligent traditional Catholics can be pinned into admitting the insuperable logical contradictions in all Catholic theological positions today (Novus Ordo, Recognize and Resist, and Sedevacantist), yet simply state “it’s a mystery, to be resolved”, or “the Truth taught by Christ through his Church is superior to our fallible reason”, and such.  Many of these same extremely intelligent individuals reject all of evolution and believe in literal interpretation of Genesis.  At the end of the day, they want to be traditional Catholics, no matter what, and the same very often goes with those attached to equality, and to the heaven on earth they’re going to build.

            @Joachim-It sounds like the people you are describing are NOT true traditional, Orthodox Catholics.The ones who have been “red pilled” (or whatever) understand Canon 188 and understand that in the current case, Sedevacantism does NOT apply to Jorge / Pope Benedict XVI. The latter is still the one and only Pope.
Curious to know what you mean about “recognize and resist.” Never heard that catchphrase.
The traditional Catholics I know do not believe in the literal interpretation of Genesis. It sounds like they are Evangelicals.
Interesting comments. Thanks for sharing.

        All of the themes discussed above are captured in this brief McEnroe clip.  Elite lordliness.  Show trial ambiance.  Sputtering &amp; groveling to escape the void.  Feigning belief in the absurd…apologies required for not maintaining the absurd.
(For those unfamiliar with sports or tennis.  Thanks to MSM lies and hype, much of the Western world is under the impression that the best women’s tennis player is as good as the best men.  Anyway, an embarrassing performance from all parties.  But at least he managed a clever maneuver at the end.)

            From WikipediaAnother event dubbed a “Battle of the Sexes” took place during the 1998 Australian Open[52] between Karsten Braasch and the Williams sisters. Venus and Serena Williams had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world’s top 200, so Braasch, then ranked 203rd, challenged them both. Braasch was described by one journalist as “a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager”.[53][52] The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park,[54] after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5–0, beat her 6–1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6–2.[55] Braasch said afterwards, “500 and above, no chance”. He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game “fun”.[56] Braasch said the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier, and that men put spin on the ball that the women can’t handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.[52]

                Whitney, great story about the Aussie guy.   But forget about ranked guys.  I’ve played tennis my whole life.  Good *college* guys would beat the top women.  Hell I’ve seen club players who’d beat them.  But of course, half of this fuss was about a white man speaking something other than high praise for our Great Black Queen.

        The most important psychological purpose of obvious lies is probably to humiliate, cow and check for submission in ‘recipients’ of that lie. That said, a million reasons to lie, obviously.

            That word “submission” keeps popping up in today’s conversation.  It is no coincidence.  In-your-face lying, cheating, and stealing is all about forcing submission.  It is what tyrants and unhappy people of all stripes seek from others.  If there is an expectation of your submission involved in any relationship you engage in, run, don’t walk.  It’s a cookbook.
