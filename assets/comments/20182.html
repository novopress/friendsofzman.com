            Yeah, and moreover, you should bully the other right-wing content creators into following your clean style.
Our side has a lot of sites with decent content dragged down by terrible style. Style matters, especially for newcomers and/or right-curious types. It‚Äôs like what you wear to the interview.
The length of the articles is absolutely perfect. Students should be forced to study them in ‚ÄúRight Wing 101‚Äù class.

                Bare-bones is a nice niche look.  I still like AoS‚Äôs circa-2004 style for plain-sites.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, Daily Caller‚Äôs site crashes more machines than ZeroHedge.  Open both sites at once and your cubicle implodes.

                        Just finished the ‚Äúobligatory disclaimers‚Äù and a long recommended reading list.  Letting some select haters beta this weekend if all goes well.  Most is behind a registration-only wall (forum for OurGuys, invite only), but I‚Äôll break something out for public consumption as well.  IRL vetting required for the forum, so it‚Äôs pretty much limited to those who were at SoCal‚Äôs MLK Appreciation Weekend 2020 for now.

        some people have suggested I give D-Live a tryPlease don‚Äôt do livestreams. They‚Äôre not broadcasts, they‚Äôre meandering, interminable glorified Google Hangout confabs between a wannabe leader and his flock of initiates with a peephole for the tolerated laity to spy through.Besides, they‚Äôre an extremely inefficient* form of communication. Subtracting the pre-show music, filler talk while people join in, housekeeping talk, mic problems and other technical difficulties, arguing with NinjaNazi and TurboSperg in the chat and then banning them, explaining to QMom6Gorillion why she was kicked off the Discord and reading endlessNotice-Me-Senpaisuperchats, there‚Äôs little left that‚Äôs interesting, edifying or otherwise valuable to the average listener.*Unless you ambition to groom a simping section of NEET devotees, which, admittedly, has proved a goldmine to many.

                My point is that there is not a livestream in existence, however interesting, that wouldn‚Äôt be punchier, more enjoyable &amp; more convenient to listen to in a  traditional non-interactive format. In other words, when an internet show goes to that format all else being equal, it automatically becomes a lesser show. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the absolute content value decreases, just that said content is less efficiently packaged since it becomes diluted in dead air, digressions and frivolities.Look at Lionel and Vox Day for cases in point.The only exception being comedy shows where said frivolities supplement the material.

            Top kek Anon, that was a hilarious summary of the typical D-live clusterF. A sure fire way to kill your signal to noise ratio.
Like the others here have said, if it ain‚Äôt broke‚Ä¶ right now you are lean &amp; Spartan with heavy hitting power. If you pivot to more ‚Äòchrome/bling‚Äô that may or may not come along. In a Web 3.0 world having really solid content in an old school format is a bit of a rarity. To quote my favorite ‚Äòpretend Italian‚Äô jew‚ô´Don‚Äôt go changin‚Äô, to try and please me‚Ä¶‚ô´

        i like text presentation of information over video.  in fact, i almost never watch video podcasts.   one reason is that text is less ambiguous than video, another is that it is easier to go back and re-view/re-read a section with text.  and the final reason is that i can hide what i am doing at work with text, easier than with video üôÇ
one thing i think you could be good at, is finding historical parallels to current world conditions.  not just surface similarities, but deeper societal features.

‚Äî-YT is great for ‚ÄúHow-to‚Äù.  Utility drops off sharply after that.

        Ditto on the plain look, plain language. Far too many sites over the years have gotten bogged down in ‚Äúfresh looks‚Äù to be readable any more. Or, perhaps they ran out of ideas and had to concentrate on other.
I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm like a lot of others and find the podcasts great for driving time, when we can pay attention while still doing other things. The problem with videos is that they require complete attention and dedicated time. My life is far too busy to set aside time for videos.

        I too prefer the essays to video.  I find that YT is becoming useless for anything but entertainment and cooking how-tos.  One topic I‚Äôd suggest for a podcast is an exploration of evaluating places to live:  urban versus rural; small, medium or large; how to avoid diversity; etc.  You clearly have some perspective, having lived in Lagos for years and apparently decided to relocate.  Share the thought process.  In particular, I am trying to figure out how to move to a new location and successfully integrate with people who won‚Äôt be antithetical to Our Thing.  I need a more robust mannerbund, and it isn‚Äôt happening in my current abode,

            I dearly loved the 1990‚Äôs version of ‚ÄúThe Outer Limits.‚Äù I thought this might be relevant: many plot lines revolve around a person or group living in their own little world; if they think of the greater world at all, it‚Äôs an illusion the overloads supply (similar to ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù). Balancing this out, however, are some positive episodes where the group accepts a new reality and escapes self-imposed prisons. Or on the downside, they remain in a cherished illusion because the real, outer world is actually hostile and too horrible to contemplate.

                        Yes, very similar order of intellect among those.  It worries me that no new pundits are arising to fill their shoes.  It gives credence to the idea that we are getting dumber as a people.  I mean there are some ardent young guns like Fuentes, but no one with the general intellectual heft outside politics, or the academic credentials.  Of course they may be waiting in the weeds somewhere.

        With the mortgage market imploding people well positioned to buy a house might be able to get good deals when this is over. I on the other hand might not do so well given this house I bought in better times might lose value leaving me owing more than this place is worth. Oh well, maybe hyperinflation might kick in and I can pay the place off with a wheelbarrow full of worthless Fiat in a year or so, assuming I still have a job.

            Cynically offered: Don‚Äôt overlook what happened in the housing bust of 2008-? Homeowners with a mortgage suddenly worth more than the property either just walked away or more strategically, just stayed in place and sometime for years before eviction. At times because the lenders didn‚Äôt even have a deed or proof of the mortgage. Not everybody wants a foreclosure on their credit report, but if this downturn is as bad as 2008‚Äôs, a lot of real estate is going to be frozen/bad mortgages again. If you‚Äôre suddenly unemployed and the cash flow is gone, why pay the mortgage? Already millions are in this fix, and while deferring the rent and utilities for a while (interest accrues? Must they pay it back?) or sending everybody a $1200 check are happy pills, the underlying debt won‚Äôt vanish so easily.Uncle Sam won‚Äôt bail out everyone. The crooked mortgage lenders, yes, but not the stupid borrowers. And once again, the citizens who practiced sensible financial practices, living in a paid-in-full home, are screwed by the bad behavior of others and worst, such rot abetted by the government itself. The good intentions still lead to the same place, whether the road is a mule trail or an 8 lane brand-new freeway üôÇ

        D-Live booted some of their spicier guys like Randbot last year but they still have content that‚Äôs pretty far beyond anything we get up to here. IIRC, that happened around the time of the Great Shoahening from YouTube that took down James Allsup and others.Having a cross-platform presence is probably the best way to go for all that it dilutes the brand somewhat.We‚Äôve discussed here before how the trend towards video is a generational thing.  I‚Äôm never going to be a ‚Äúvideo first‚Äù person in terms of consuming content but creation-wise if I did an ‚Äúopen‚Äù site I‚Äôd do video &amp; pod content just because so many people under 40 consider this format the equivalent of grandpa‚Äôs newspaper now.I still and always will love reading &gt; viewing.  In these dark days without text-search-for-video, I don‚Äôt have the patience to watch hour-long clips to find the nuggets I‚Äôm looking for and the topical ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù we‚Äôve developed to substitute is still vastly unsatisfying.  It‚Äôs a giant PITA for creators who spend hours queuing up clips and other pre-fixing only to have clunky Windows 10, Twitter vidya etc‚Ä¶ wreck their prep.I‚Äôm similarly dubious re: travel.  I‚Äôm holding out tentative hope that I can visit Ireland, Russia &amp; Scandinavia, maybe even non-London Britain, but I‚Äôd put the odds at 1/3 based on nothing more solid than my barely-educated guess.Travel within the continent should still be doable, even to Canada (like they could stop me if I were so inclined).  If you see anything on CBC about ‚ÄúWhite Supreemiss border-jumper claims asylum from Trump Admin,‚Äù I‚Äôll be flashing the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù signal for lulz.

        My two cents, fwiw, agree that you‚Äôre filling a shrinking space with the essay format. It seems, to me, a more in depth and engaging format than the wild gesticulations on video. Also, I like the Liddy style news commentary, you have a good talent for cutting through BS.Good luck getting out of Lagos. I myself am hoping I didn‚Äôt wait too long to get out of the northern NE, especially now that the New Yorkers have started to move in. Maybe I can get one of them to pay a premium on my house and acreage. Interesting times indeed.

        If you did a video talking head show I honestly would never see it.  I don‚Äôt have time to sit in front of my computer or hold my phone in my face for 30+ minutes just to watch a guy talk.
But audio podcasts I consume all day long while working.  Yours are a weekly must-listen.  Occasionally I miss something when I have to concentrate on a calculation or a saw cut (I make furniture), but the rest of the time what I do is like driving‚Äìcan listen and drive screws or sand at the same time.

        Comments section reflects the author and the nature of the site. Video is for passive consumption, while reading, though you‚Äôre sitting still, is active. Essays, even though short, require people to sit for a minute or two and think. You might not consider that a high bar, but apparently it is.
But revolutions, if that‚Äôs actually on the agenda, require people to do more than sit and think. They require mass participation. Moving beyond a DR ghetto, and growing the audience, might require video. I think experimenting with a video format is worth doing.

        This is a quality blog, even when I disagree w the host. If I were to suggest something it would not exactly be original but it has been gradually dawning on me in real time that population replacement is the issue on the DR I care the most about. I think it is the most important and devastating. How do we deal with that? What can be done to stop it? Given that whites WILL become minority in the United States, what does that mean on the ground level?

        I like the plain site.  It‚Äôs all about the ideas.  Form follows function, and all that.  Have you considered surveying your readers to determine a percentage of those who also listen to your podcast, and how often?  There is probably a high correlation between readers and listeners, so you can extrapolate a good estimate from your unique visitors.  As an example, I read you every day, but listen to about 50% of the podcasts, as it depends on my time in the car.  Derb posts a transcript, but I vaguely recall you saying that is a pain to produce.

        I second those above who opt for minimal change. I like your short essay format and read them most days, along with the comments. I also listen to your Friday podcasts and enjoy them. I do like the idea of an occasional book review segment.

        Why is March different? Years ago I used to see an annual publication showing how many items of a certain product sold in which month, at least in the UK. The weird thing was that for some reason tape recorders (yes, this was back in the seventies) sold most in March compared to any other month.
I knew this must be true as the first tape recorder my father bought for me was in, er, March one year.

            In my business life, I‚Äôve often had to tackle the problem of seasonality. It almost always makes sense once you account for how seasons change behavior. For example, Florida tourism does better when it is very cold and snowy in the Northeast. I‚Äôm at a lose as to why March would make people more interested in this stuff. Maybe the change in sunlight hours makes people more energetic. Traffic does decline slowly through spring into July, the slowest month. Then it ticks back up and gets close to March levels during the holidays. Then it falls off for winter.

                March is also ‚Äúthe cruelest month‚Äù (poet said?) and this certainly applies in Z‚Äôs latitude (I grew up just S of Lagos) so I know the climate. In March, it‚Äôs not unusual to get cold, damp, rain, sleet or a small snow, and a few days later (or earlier) you‚Äôll have a few days of sunny pre-Spring, with emerging flowers, bugs and suchlike entities. Literally, around DC, March (or even Feb.) can give you anything from a foot of snow (gone in a day), to 90 degree summer weather. Usually of course it‚Äôs something in the middle of those extremes. Of course, the same thing happens lots of places, just called April, May, etc. üôÇ

        I like things as they are too, Z. I am not a fan of podcasts but I do listen to yours on Spreaker every a Friday. They are ordered and presented as a formal talk and I like that you go to the effort to do that. I like Scott Adams but his style drives me nuts. You have to listen to too much prattle to get the good stuff, and while he does have something to say‚Ä¶ his signal to noise ratio is maddening.Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing a talk show format with a high profile guest, maybe. Cornelius Rye from Gab comes to mind.üòâüëç

The do nothings who think posting immature memes in echo chambers while hoping something, anything will change and then magic box, bam, better future. They are so tiresome.If they‚Äôd stop larping and start taking the future a little more seriously maybe they‚Äôd be able to plan in a realistic way. Accepting we are the little people so our change is going to be from the bottom up. It‚Äôs a place to start. They reek of such desperation they just drive people away.

        You might consider breaking the podcast videos into individual segments. That way individual pieces can become ‚Äúclassics‚Äù with a life of their own on the platforms. As it is now, they‚Äôre ‚Äúlocked‚Äù into the podcast.
Or maybe just pull out the ‚Äúhiglight‚Äù segments that are on evergreen subjects that won‚Äôt become dated.

        Z there is a tech called BOXCAST that has reliable, built in analytics, its for video.
Mind you not free, but worth it for video and analytics.  Built really for sports casts, news, townhalls.

        Z, I love the ‚ÄúPlain site[, p]lain language‚Äù approach you take.  Your essays are the perfect length‚Äîjust when I start thinking, ‚Äúokay, how much more is there,‚Äù I‚Äôm getting to the penultimate (or antepenultimate) paragraph.The podcast is excellent.  I‚Äôm always amazed how you make each segment almost exactly ten minutes, and the whole thing exactly an hour.  I usually will listen to the podcast a minimum of three times over the weekend, time-permitting.  I listen on YouTube, as it‚Äôs just the easiest way to consume it.Your old podcast on fascism was really fascinating.  The metaphor of restoring an old house really resonated with me, as I grew up in an old Queen Anne-style home that my parents renovated with a lot of sweat equity.  Everyone thought my folks were crazy to buy a dilapidated house; no one things that now.  That said, I‚Äôd be interested in hearing another deep dive into fascism‚Äìmaybe Franco‚Äôs Spain?  It‚Äôs an engaging topic.I look forward to your daily posts (I‚Äôm always on the lookout for the notification on Telegram that the day‚Äôs post is up).Keep up the great work!  If you do move, I highly recommend South Carolina, my home.  Traditional, conservative, and affordable.  We have beaches and mountains, and lots of great seafood and Southern cooking.  The girls are prettier here than anywhere else, too, and people are friendly.  But then, I‚Äôm biased.God Bless, and Happy Easter!

        Z: You mentioned a while ago your gun position.  Its probably a fruitful topic you dont hit much (i often listen to the podcast while reloading).  What role can gun shop culture play in our thing, how are guns as a cultural symbol involved in our thing, is hunting an inherently our thing activity and why/why not, what can we learn from the nra‚Äôs past failures and successes, what does our enemy (John Brown gun club, antifa with AKs) do with guns and how does that interface with the typical lib grabbers‚Ä¶

        I am not sure a badge is a good idea, unless it is very subtle. Maybe you could implement a feature for subscribers where they can subscribe to replies without email confirmation using their SubscribeStar somehow. Things which offer a little convenience.

        Please, moderate the comment section, delete the upvote/downvote feature, and impose a limit on the number of comments a participant can post in a day.You write and speak eloquently about the need for people on this side of the river to be a Prince among Men and the reasonable voice in the room as mechanisms to provide normies who are starting to Notice with a sane space full of high-quality, reasonable, and thoughtful people to consider a view of the world from this side of the river. However, as your audience has expanded the comment section has degraded significantly, both in terms of content and language. The comment section now fails miserably in these objectives. Normies who are rowing across the river and who visit this blog are now likely to scroll through the comment section, write this place off as a ghetto for racists, misogynists, and haters, and turn around and row back. Somewhat ironically, the comment section is actively undermining the cause you purport to advance in this blog.I blame a significant part of the degradation in the comment section on on the upvote/downvote feature. People who comment like getting upvotes, and the comment section has become something of a contest to see who can get the most upvotes by making the edgiest comment. I‚Äôve been reading this blog daily since 2014. I used to learn things reading the comment section, but for the most part that‚Äôs no longer the case. There may be some good comments, but it‚Äôs become a chore wading through the dreck to find that hidden jewel.Another part of the degradation is due to the fact that the comment section is being taken over by a relatively small group of people who post excessively. The post on April 2 has 379 comments as I am writing this. There is a small group of commenters who have over 20 comments each, most of which are simply sniping at each other. This is precisely the kind of dreck that has made the comment section unbearable. If a reader is posting more than 3-5 comments per day they are probably just shitposting or sniping, which is a value subtractor.Finally, a comment about writing. A writer has to be cautious and cognizant that you will reap in your audience and in the comment section that which you sow in your writing. Steve Sailer morphed his writing style from a fairly straightforward analytical/statistical style to a style laced heavily with snark. His comment section is now largely a clown car parade of morons competing to make the pithiest comment. It‚Äôs worse that Twitter. Similarly, Vox Day‚Äôs writing has become far angrier and conspiratorial, and his comment section is now an unreadable morass of conspiracy theory freaks.As a regular reader since 2014, I feel like this blog is coming to a fork in the road and you are going to have to make some difficult decisions. If your goal is to grow your audience as much as possible then you are probably on the right course. But if your goal is to attract the kind of high-quality people that might be useful to a nascent political movement, then a course correction is probably required. I used to refer people to this blog, but I will no longer do so because the comment section has become so vile.

            I‚Äôm ‚Äìpartly‚Äì in agreement with this especially re: volume of comments. But I think what Guest is suggesting sound a bit draconian as heavily moderated comments tend to suck in a different way from my experience.I‚Äôve said that I have kept myself very limited here in that I only post if I have something semi-insightful / profound. I think this is a good rule of thumb. I get the fact that everyone has a lot to say but I do think 10-12 posts from a single person can be excessive -especially- if they are ‚Äòtop level‚Äô (i.e. not replies).Self-policing is the indicator of high intelligence and being well adjusted, and this commentariat is at the high end of that like the old Takimag section. There has been a degradation but not as acute as our ‚Äòguest‚Äô would make it out to be.The upvote/downvote is also a double edged sword for certain. I‚Äôm very conflicted about it myself and really don‚Äôt see a solution for it that would satisfy all sides of the argument.

            I agree that there are now too many comments to read and that this wasn‚Äôt the case a few months ago.  I would support a limit on the number of comments a person can make per post.  This would encourage each commenter to make every shot count.
With playful respect to Guest I reply, ‚Äúyou say, ‚Äòracists, misogynists, and haters‚Äô like they‚Äôre bad things.‚Äù

            There are some guys who post here A LOT. But even when I disagree with them I enjoy the comments and the interaction. Especially at this moment when I am trying to teach kids math ‚Äúfrom a distance‚Äù.
Some interaction is good. I would do more myself but life, work, dying mother, and other things get in my way.
This site would be MUCH BETTER if several of you would UPS me some toilet paper. üôÇ

            Vox moderates his blog like a demon and it hasn‚Äôt done him a stitch of good, other than making him look foolish. If you want to see someone that can turn the normies off ‚Äì that‚Äôs your boy. If you watch him long enough, you will see that he doubles down, lies, and projects. He also displays all the traits of the gamma male that he claims to despise. I won‚Äôt take him seriously. His blog is less of a regular read for me now, and more of a pit stop. He‚Äôs getting stale with his MENSA warrior act too.There is always going to be content you disagree with on any site. What I like about this one is that I am relatively free to disagree as long as I am not a dink about it. The guys reciprocate. Toning it down to appeal to cucks would probably destroy it. Who wants that? I come here to read the edgy stuff, to think out loud and listen to others do the same.I hope it stays that way.
