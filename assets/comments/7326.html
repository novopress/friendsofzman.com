        From what I have read about those chicken farmers tied to those slaughterhouses they are little more than slaves to them.   They can only sell to the massa for the price massa sets.  They lose money on the birds, well too bad.   At least as a grain farmer they can sell toanyone.

            That’s the way it works. Grain is much easier to transport world wide to market  than live chickens.

        I was thinking along some similar lines the other day, which essentially is: why do we have to have diversity? Who thought it a good idea?It seems to me that we have arrived at a point to the complete bewilderment of ordinary people, in which the ruling elite have decided diversity is great (without seemingly having thought about what it means in reality and certainly not by putting forward any arguments *before* diversity was imposed. Making noises *after* doing it is not the same thing) and left the rest us in the potential ‘hate position’ of not wanting it but likely to be in trouble should you oppose the whole idea.So we have diversity. Job done. Yet what do we get after that? Someone shouting for “more diversity” because apparently all the diversity we have had hasn’t been enough. Having for example lots of muslims on our streets (a lot of northern and midland cities in England are already finding have more than they can cope with) hasn’t made anyone happy, but worse of all it hasn’t even made the the ones who dreamed up the bizarre idea in the first place because they want more and more.A distant relative of mine who lives very well in London wants to see more diversity, though (whisper it) not on his own pleasant street. He would be happy for, say, Rotherham to be more diverse. Providing of course he doesn’t have to visit the place.

        When I was a young adventurous man I drove across this vast land to end up in Southern California, the beach communities.   Sun, water young women by the score paradise to a young mid-western buck.  Walking along a secluded road I saw a young boy about 8 or maybe 9 years old.  I asked about a trail that leads down to a surf spot known only to the locals.  He turned to me and replied sharply “I know, but I won’t tell you!” turned around just as sharply and walked away.  I was shocked that a youngster would talk to an older person like that and also shocked he wouldn’t give out directions.  That was how I learned the concept “LOCALS ONLY”  Outsiders go to hell and stay there we don’t want you or your money no thank-you very much.  I’ve never forgotten that and I fully understand his reply.

        On the one hand, I often think a return to universal conscription would solve a lot of this problem.  Two years spent cheek-by-jowl down in the motor pool with Billy Bob would burst a lot of bubbles pretty fast (which also means Billy Bob has some stories to tell if the bubble gets rebuilt).  On the other hand, our culture has been preaching thishomo economicusstuff for a long time, to the point where my students simply don’t grok the concept of just not buying something.  They look at me like I’m an alien when I tell them “no, I don’twantthe iPhone 12; if you gave it to me as a gift, I’d return it for store credit, and barring that, I’d give the damn thing away.”  You’re not allowed to make that kind of decision these days.

            Germany did away with military and social conscription in 2010-2011. Males had the choice of either military service or perform social services in their local community; working in old age homes, assisting with mentally disabled or the physically handicapped, etc. Young men were paid about 400€/month and our society benefitted from what they contributed. Unfortunately, both services were eliminated to save money.  Personally, I would like to see it brought back and anyone who immigrates here has to do at least 2-years of service as part of their requirement for citizenship.

                Agreed.  I’d be ok with this, or even something like the odious “Teach” for America (=Propagandize for America) if it wereconscripted.I’d be fine with just about anything, provided that a) there’s a good chance a plumber from the middle of nowhere is your platoon sergeant (or functional equivalent) and there were NO exemptions for college attendance, status, etc.  If Harvard boys had to spend a few weeks in foxholes with Billy Bob and D’Shawn, there’d be no more “Harvard boys” (D’Shawn and Billy Bob would benefit, too).

        I went back to my great grandfather’s home town not too long ago. (He bought the farm in WW1 and the local VFW post is named for him.). I was stunned how folks had really turned their backs on the global economy. It was almost impossible to find a store that would take credit cards and chain businesses were vanishingly rare. The town I’m living in right now seems to be on a cusp.  Out of state chain businesses are not doing well and quite a few have shut down.I saw one of those “no farms, no food” bumper stickers the other day. It should really read, “no justice, no food.”

        “The great line of demarcation in modern politics, Eric Voegelin used to point out, is not a division between liberals on one side and totalitarians on the other. No, on one side of that line are all those men and women who fancy that the temporal order is the only order, and that material needs are their only needs, and that they may do as they like with the human patrimony. On the other side of that line are all those people who recognize an enduring moral order in the universe, a constant human nature, and high duties toward the order spiritual and the order temporal.”http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/detail/ten-conservative-principles/

        Karl, God forbid that hard labor be met with hard compensation. I live in a part of the country far from the Mexican border, the farms are family owned not the plantations like they have in California. White people happily do the work. some fucker trying to get rich destroying the family farmer by importing helot labor to new found plantations has no sympathy from me. Karl why do you feel the need to belch out support for them? and why do Germans get such pleasure out waving their fingers in states of smug stupidity I shall never know. It’s breed into them though, they do it on both sides of the Atlantic.

        An engineering colleague of mine had a contract with a farm in the California central valley to expand their vegetable processing plant. It was interesting to note that inside the plant, it was predominantly white engineers, welders and pipe fitters (tradesmen) who were doing the upgrades. But when harvesting time came it was all Mexican workers in the fields or processing lines;  no whites or blacks showed up for those jobs. Americans (white or black) won’t lower themselves to doing that sort of work these days, certainly no Millennials. Oddly enough, this is same work their Grandfathers came looking for during the Depression and Great Dustbowl of the early 1930’s.Here in Europe we’re running into a similar problem. Too many young people have gotten into college and now are no longer interested in the trades or labor; running milling machines, welding and definitely not digging ditches or highway construction. That’s what Poles, Russians, Romanians and Turks are for. As our welfare roles increase, no one is asking these people to actually contribute anything by working for their handouts. Instead we’re told we have to bring in more foreigners.We have lots of work for people. There’s just no incentive for them to do it.

            “no whites or blacks showed up for those jobs. Americans (white or black) won’t lower themselves to doing that sort of work these days, certainly no Millennials.”Son of a bitch, I’m sick of hearing this kind of bullshit. How can you know this? When the brown people you let in over the border are desperate for ANY work at ANY wage, and (in the case of illegals) have no recourse to defend their interests legally because they are here illegally, of course they are going to displace the local workforce. Kick out the illegals, secure the borders, and then let’s see what happens. I guarantee you it will be one of three outcomes: (1) wages will rise sufficiently to attract the local workforce; (2) the jobs will be automated; or (3) the product in question will stop being offered because no one wants to buy it at the higher price, which has a side benefit of bankrupting the scum who hire foreigners in the first place. All of these outcomes are obviously superior to our existing arrangements.

                @ BB – they weren’t illegal workers, they’re migrant workers. There is a rather large coordinated group of Mexican-Americans who organize and manage these workers and surprisingly enough, the workers are all legal. Farmers won’t risk hiring illegals and this ensures the same workers that come every year get the jobs. The Canadians do something similar –  they bring their combines (harvesters) down from Canada and harvest wheat starting in the north and driving south towards North Texas. Evidently it’s been going on for years. Nothing new.

                    I don’t give a shit whether they are legal or illegal, they are foreigners who don’t belong in this country. As a German, I’m surprised I have to lecture you on the obvious perils of “guest workers”. They are the camel’s nose under the tent that lead to the breakdown of borders and the breakdown of society. Either raise the wage, automate the job, or go bankrupt and get out of the fucking business.

                        Are you also referring to the Canadians as “foreigners who don’t belong in this country?” I suspect there are a number of American farmers who heavily depend on these services who ultimately contribute in a positive way to the survival of the average American farmer. Are you suggesting these farmers, who can’t find local workers, should go out of business rather than hire people who are willing to do the work?
