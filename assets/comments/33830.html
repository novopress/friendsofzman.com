        Have you all noticed that the more we rely on technology and computers, the more the quality and overall experience goes down? I think we’ve been conditioned to accept bugs and tolerate glitches because of technology and this has forced us to accept mediocrity.Have you noticed how nothing works anymore? I remember when AT&amp;T used to advertise the dependability of their networks. They used to run commercials about how you could rely on old Ma Bell in the event of an emergency. Nowadays, how many drops before you get through the 911? We’ve really become very third world-ish in the delivery of our services.I’ve been trying to get an invoice paid for 9 months from a vendor. Press one, leave a voicemail, no human being to talk to anymore. They think pushing work off on customers by automating everything makes them smart and efficient. Quality of everything from restaurant food to solving billing problems has gone down the crapper.That’s a long way of saying I don’t trust the same people who made this Lenovo tablet that can’t keep a consistent Wi-Fi connection, to give me a car that doesn’t crap out and glitch out at inopportune moments.

            i cannot tell you the horrible thoughts i have, when i have to reboot my fukkin’ TV?!   having all the apps run in the tv is convenient (one remote to rule them all) but it comes with attendant costs.

                Roku’s don’t work, phones freeze up, I have to reboot three times and sometimes have to reinstall software to get a reasonably expensive Fujitsu scanner I own to work … Nothing freaking works anymore. Then we have all the Chinese crap we buy at Walmart you have to pitch once the switch on it breaks.
People used to complain about the big three automakers back in the 1970s and 1980s. Compared to what we have today, that was leading edge quality.

                    a good chunk of those incredibly crappy cars are still on the road (esp the 70’s woo bad) way more than most of the crap being produced today will still be working in 40 years.

                        And if you read Bob Lutz’s book, his take on it was that the government forced all kinds of emissions technology on the automakers that was unproven and that the automakers didn’t have time to test. Without government intervention, American car quality would have been adequate. Just another business important to the economy that the US government has wrecked.

                            That’s much less of a scandal than the early mandates for air bags in cars.  Estimated that in the early 90’s something like 60-100 deaths attributable to air bags in cars.
This of course is not the case today.  But nonetheless was known to the Fed’s who basically made the call to trade lives via their mandates.

                                The federal government was heavy-handed. But deaths per million miles driven has dropped drastically. The new safety technology works. I had an Old wrecker driver tell me he sees people walk away from crashes that used to routinely kill people.

                            the real complaints about the cars in the 70s and 80s were poor fabrication (one of these fenders is 27″ long, one is 28″ and LEARN TO WELD), crummy metalurgy (rustbuckets, all of em), poor quality paint and application, and poor compatibility of borrowed components to avoid re-engineering and retooling costs. all of which are very true. why does a 6500 pound k2500 have the same saginaw power steering pump as a 2500 pound monte carlo?The Boomer complaints about Carter Corvettes etc on power and handling (carriage springs!) arent that salient any more; if you want a 1000 hp coupe to sling around the local speedway on track days, you’re getting a c7 or an m3 any way, not a c3.

                                My dad was in the car business during the ’70s yellow peril era. I remember him complaining that he couldn’t buy cars he actually wanted, foreign ones that weren’t garbage, because union steel guys were burning them in parking lots.What I know from that period is guitars. American ones were so bad (on average) that they aren’t even overpricednow. Instead the Japanese ones are, because they’re physically useable. When new they were great deals, so cheap they were easy to lie about. The stigma on them lasted into this century.Likewise, a Datsun is 40k now. The pointy Corvettes the magazines taught us to fantasize about are half that.

                            Well, I get all this but as someone that is still a shade tree mechanic for much of what others won’t touch in modern cars I have a few things to say.1. Underneath all the crap sensors, lady-like plastic ‘beauty cover’ there still resides Henry Ford’s internal combustion engine. Head, block, spark plugs, valves, etc. That leaves whether it is:a) Turbocharged or normally aspirated.b) Interference or not.Whomever the IDIOT that invented the “interference” engine is should be tarred and feathered. The term relates to the fac that the valves AND the pistons use the same space inside the engine — and are only kept apart by a marriage counselor – known as a timing belt (rubber) or chain. Either fail (or in the case of the chain, stretch a bit) the valve and the piston collide, either ‘locking up’ (literally) your engine or destroying it.2. I admit EVERYTHING is HARDER to work on. To reach. I basically assume that these things are designed, like everything today, to rob the user. In that sense, it means LOTS of dealership ‘hours’ to do anything. Ca-ching. I know for A FACT — FIRST HAND that dealership mechanics bring value to their employers as follows: the ‘book’ says a repair takes ‘X’ amount of time; that is what the customer is billed in HOURS. However, any decent mechanic can get these jobs done in half or far less than the billed time. Thus the better ones get 2 jobs done where their employer bills for 4, and so on. I KNOW THAT FIRST HAND.3. Ok, so the goal is to fuck you with fraud, as what I KNOW FIRST HAND in ‘2’ is done and is fraud… they aim to keep you out from under the hood with complexity. So you need to choose your cars wisely if you want to maintain them. I will continue ….

                        I partly agree, the old cars that you still see on the road were the very few survivors of millions of just a few models.Computerized vehicle controls ie engine/transmission along with some newer overall designs are overall, in my opinion better in many ways.As far as dependability &amp; maintainance. Also in my opinion however, like most things a lot.of tech was and continues to be way overdone wich has led to less dependability, durability and simplicity of maintainance.Consider that you just do not see nearly as many broken down on the side of the road as you used to. Except that when you do it’s usually a very expensive fix. I spent the majority of my working life in the repair industry, in about two weeks I’m gonna pop smoke.&amp; do many other things while I still can. God bless y’all

                        I know a lot of people with modern Hondas that have over 200,000 miles. Even Chevy and Ford trucks. They’ve had a few maintenance issues but not many. Back in the 70s, an Oldsmobile would be rusted out and in need of a new engine by 80,000 miles.  Odometers didn’t even go to 100,000 miles. That was true until the 1990s.

                    90s cars are loaded with failing ECMs with caps leaking and damaging the boards.  Replacement ECMs for them haven’t been made in decades. The old ones in junkyards have the same problem.

                        The proliferation of electronics will severely limit the viability of classic cars from the ’80s forward.I suppose it might be possible for someone to design bespoke circuit boards and subsystem to try and duplicate the functionality of the original electronics with modern components.Even so, it’s hard to imagine how those electronics could be tested and integrated to a level that approaches the original factory reliability.Anyone that could make that work could charge wealthy enthusiasts and arm and a leg. I’ve looked into some of the aftermarket stuff that’s out there, and it doesn’t really seem close to the level of OEM electronics.

                    Yep.  With my EV, sometimes the screen doesn’t even turn on—but the car drives without instrumentation being visible.  Some days the settings reset and the car has a different look and feel.  I suspect a reload on the OS for a “car”—not a PC—no less.  Then there are all perturbations of the above imaginable.  Like the radio works, but won’t play inserted media, just am/fm.
The solution always is to pull over.  Turn off the vehicle, count to 15 and restart it.  But really folks, who needs this….

                    I had an experience at IAH that is an example of technology going too far. The terminal that I was at no longer has rows of reasonably comfortable seats. Instead they have tables, many with high stools, set up more for work than relaxing.On the table there is a QR code for each seat which you scan so you can order food at the restaurant by the gate and maybe others nearby and have your food delivered by an actual human being. Well I tried it and had to sign up for an app, which would not accept my cc, which I had used earlier in the day. Wouldn’t accept my debit card either. So I found a place not too far away with actual human beings taking orders.

                    People used to complain about the big three automakers back in the 1970s and 1980s. Compared to what we have today, that was leading edge quality.TempoNick, from my experience, today’s cars areNOTHINGlike the lemons  🍋  🍋  🍋  that poured forth from GM, Ford, Chrysler, or AMC factories in the 1970s – 1990s. I had a 2003 Chevrolet pickup I owned for almost a dozen years through the salt and snow of Chicagoland winters and at the end only small sections of the cab and bed got a little rusty. A 1973 Chevrolet pickup would be a pile of rust by twelve years old. (Or at least with huge rust holes in the sheetmetal one could put a fist through). I never had to do a tune up nor change the spark plugs (just the air filter). We had a Mazda that lasted almost ten years before M’Lady got the new car itch and had a jackass not rear-ended it a Hyundai sedan that was basically trouble free (less a brake job and a tire) for almost six years.Yes, I will agree cars today are too stuffed with computer apps that will cause problems down the road (and I hate the proliferation of touch screens) but mechanically? Night and day my man.

                “designed to degrade sharply in performance in 12-18 months.”
Technically, their performance doesn’t actually degrade. It’s that the environment they operate in, due to Moore’s law, is a moving target, with new apps and features being developed for newer, higher performing devices, all the time, requiring a continuous upgrade in performance. Your VCR player didn’t become useless because its performance degraded. It became useless because technology moved on. Typically, Moore’s law is a doubling in performance every 18 months.

            I called into Obamacare yesterday and got an African (descendent of slave African that is, doesn’t it suck that I have to make that distinction?) who was so incompetent that he could barely read the script.
i had to abandon that one so I called back and got a she-African, again a heritage one, who was more on the ball.
it’s funny how Obamacare only seems to hire these Africans

                “funny how…”MeetLaTarsha Brownof Allentown, Pennsylvania. LaTarsha is employed and overpaid at the city’s [ahem] community and economic development department where, one day, she claimed to have found a noose at her desk.Such departments, sometimes by that very name, had became common in D controlled cities by the 1970’s. It was typical then for whitecucks to find employment in them but under the management and supervision of obsolete farm equipment. Of course, no one in those departments did anything productive. My own impression of the cucks, a few of whom I met, is that they were mamas’ boys raised by henpecking wives who’d been pozzed with feminism. Fathers who weren’t merely wishy-washy were drunks or just awol.

                        “Where do they get…”Don’t know, but it’s obviously motivated by rebellion against us. Sometimes this attitude leads to extemely funny outcomes. For example, once upon a time I heard a story about a college girl named Vagina, Latin for sheath or scabbard, I believe. Acc. to the story as I remember it, the first a and the i of her name are pronounced as in ‘mad’ and in ‘in’, repectively. In the story, she makes this clear by correctlng a teacher or someone else in the school who had pronounced Vagina publicly in the way we expect to hear it.Anyhow, from now in I will refer to each piece of OFE as a noosehanger when the situation calls for it, and my experience has taught me that there’s a noosehanger lurking within every one of them, needless immigrants included.

            The Weather Potato FINALLY went through puberty, andToBeQuiteHonest, she’s kinda cute now [if you’re into 4’11” chicks with B-Cups].

But the poor girl is almost certainly v@xxed to the gills [unless she was so important to the cause that they slipped her a vial of inert normal saline, rather than the clot shot which the plebians received].
For The Record, I hope they did indeed give her the inert normal saline, and that one day she meets her Pureblooded Prince Charming, and that they have lots &amp; lots &amp; lots of beautiful WHITE Scandinavian babies.

            I haven’t really noticed this. I guess I’m in a minority around here.   My cell phone works all the time. And I use it to listen to YouTube and music a lot in addition to regular phone calls. Being able to text people has been very helpful.  Being able to get immediate directions anywhere is great. The computers I use now are more reliable than the ones from 20 years ago.  The internet we have now is much better than the DSL from over 20 years ago and unbelievably better than dial-up.   And most people are getting far more miles out of their cars than they used to, although they are more expensive.

        I agree with all of this. The only thing you left out is that the high cost of ownership is a feature not a bug to elites pushing EVs. They hate sitting in traffic as much as the rest of us and would like fewer cars on the road.  One idea on the best way to implement that is to make it prohibitively expense for proles to own cars and force us into public transportation.  That most places don’t have sufficient public transportation for the majority of their population is of little to no concern of theirs.  They won’t personally be impacted.

            In 15-20 years, most places in the US will look like Old Havana, with people driving restored/repaired jalopies and pickups. The most valuable cars will be 6-cylinderd Honda or Toyota with minimal electronics and old F-150s. Somebody just like Castro will be in charge…..

                I’ll take a ‘strong man’ over muh democracy any day.  At least they are usually more honest about being in it to enrich themselves.  Yes, my husband is doing our taxes.  The amount the government has taken this year (not counting sales tax and gas tax etc.) is staggering.  Add in over $9k for ‘health insurance’ which we haven’t used, and it’s no wonder the ‘middle class’ is shrinking rapidly.

                Careful, there; Ford was on the cutting edge of electronics in the 1980s, and most all of their engines had ECMs by circa 1986ish.
Ford’s diesel trucks [F250/F350] still had mechanical fuel pumps through the first half of 1994 [the second half of 1994 saw the introduction of the electronic “Powerstroke”].
Somehow Dodge got a waiver [???] from the EPA, and continued purchasing mechanically-fuel-pumped diesel engines from Cummins, through the first half of 1998.
I know next to nothing about Chevys [other than that they had an YUGE contract with the DOD for military pickup trucks.]

        I continue to believe that the market for a low-cost ($10k to $12k), no frills car with as minimum of electronics as possible is huge. With modern factories and parts, a basic ICE which basic maintenance could run for 100s of thousands of miles easy. By keeping down the electronics, you reduce the main things that go wrong in new cars.
China absolutely could and does produce these cars, but they’re not allowed in the US.

                    Tire Pressure Sensors.  Now there is a POS system.  For every valid low pressure alarm there is a sensor failure setting you back $120 if you don’t want to see the light and pass the state inspection.
In the way-back times folks looked at their tires.

                        Tire pressure sensors…A perfect example of the nanny State enacting regulations which have no evidence of effectiveness.Here is the summary of a quick GhatGPT inquiry:”…In summary, while TPMS has played a significant role in preventing conditions that could lead to blowouts, precise statistics on the number of blowouts prevented are not readily available. The safety enhancements provided by TPMS are instead reflected in broader improvements in tire performance and a reduction in tire-related incidents overall.“In other words another good (?) idea implemented with not precise measurement of benefit by our regulatory state that will be with us forever since there can never be a cost/benefit analysis.  (It’s also a good example of the short coming of AI inquiries being accepted as fact.)

                If they sold one of these, theToyota Hilux Champ, for $13K a pop, I’d be at my Toyota dealer tomorrow begging them to take my money.
But we can’t have it because it doesn’t meet our Byzantine mess of safety and “fuel economy” regulations built over years by our evil regulatory state. If Trump really wanted to do some good, junk all of those regulations.

            Yes. So does Japan, Mexico and Brazil. Every time we go south of the Border or to South America, we drool over the Toyota Hilux. It’s basically become a dissident meme on social media. On a recent hunting trip before the election, we were all figuring out how to go down and buy one, disassemble it, send it home in pieces and reassemble it for our hunting place. But we were fearful of what Sec. Buttplug would do to us if he caught us……..

                The Hilux is, I believe, the most popular vehicle in Argentina, certainly in the rural area in which I live. We have one and they’re ubiquitous in the village.

            I also wonder why we don’t just make a cheap pickup or economy car…does the “American consumer” really prefer mid- to high-trim SUVs and pickups? How can they afford a $50K vehicle? Would they not flock to a sub-$20K modest small pickup like the Ford Maverick? (They did, but now the Mav is almost $30K.) There is apparently a $15K Toyota pickup that can’t be sold here either, but Ford and Chevy won’t allow anything to interfere with their precious F-150 and Silverado sales.

            For sure, we could have a good basic car for about half what they cost now. No frills but safe. With AC. And I suspect the electronics will just keep getting cheaper. It’s just a matter of getting rid of the corruption that keeps prices artificially inflated. One good thing about the Chinese producing cheap cars is that it will force the hand of our automakers.

        Battery driven power tools have seemingly taken over corded versions. At some point I realized they were the clear choice for me when price, power and liberation from looking for available sockets came to be. Cars are no where near that in any category. if they were, more would simply buy them.

            Battery powered tools are great, but they cost a LOT more and sooner or later they stop making the batteries and your entire investment in that battery ecosystem is lost.
Meanwhile Grandpa’s corded 1955 drill still works.
Battery for things you use all the time and are going to wear out anyway.  Corded for things you use rarely and only need every few years.  Corded is also significantly cheaper so that tool is worth getting now.

                Some of these batteries are poorly made, and can burst into flames while being charged. Lithium Ion batteries burn at around 4,000 degrees (f). I have a leaf blower that has one of these batteries. I charge it outdoors due to the fire hazard.

        Electric cars are merely a virtue-signaling device by the elites to signify that they are morally superior to the lowly proles.Electric cars were actually produced in the late 1890s and early 1900s, but they were superseded by the Model T (a flex-fuel vehicle that could burn gas, kerosine or moonshine) because it was cheaper and more reliable and more useful to the masses.The thing about electric cars that makes me scream is the Law of Conservation of Energy. “The Science” says energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transferred. The juice has got to come from somewhere and it ain’t all coming from windmills. Not to mention that the grid does not have the capability to power electric cars for everyone, even assuming they wanted them. And people who drive through lake-effect blizzards in Michigan don’t.But “Our Betters” in LA and San Francisco don’t give a shit about that, all they care about is displaying their penance to Gaia.Meanwhile they all have a 14-mpg Toyota Sequoia hidden in the garage for ski trips to Tahoe…

            Well of course the grid can’t handle the extra load from electric cars. The ultimate goal, I’m sure, is for electric cars to remain expensive, electricity rates to skyrocket, and both cars and electricity to become luxury items. The egalitarian, gynocentric, anti-racist utopia cannot be achieved until everyone outside the government/corporate hives is freezing in the dark and walking to whatever jobs we allow to exist for them. We must not anger the Weather Potato!

            I live in the Imperial Capital region. (For now.)
and I have seen quite a few bumper stickers on Teslas to the effect of “I bought this car bc I’m cool, but I don’t like Elon”
I’m sure they have very little clue that the antifers have just gone crazy at Tesla dealerships (Sat Mar 29).
But it amuses me that the virtue signaling continues apace.

        Rural normie’s are getting fed up with super-expensive high-tech luxury pickup trucks that are too fancy for farm work. As a result, an entrepreneur is now initiating a startup to build 1970s era standard work-truck pickups again. It will be stripped of fancy doodads and all the spy and remote control electronics, and be priced at about $30k. I predict it will sell like hotcakes and help bring back common sense.

            I always thought this would be a good business model for a lot of things.  The technology for items like automobiles or household appliances is in many cases over a century old (no patent protection, ect) and who the hell needs wifi capabilities on a refrigerator?  Just build simple, high-quality products with domestically produced parts by American workers.  The elimination of superfluous doodads and reduced R&amp;D can help mitigate the increased costs of doing business in America.  A company like this could be the poster child for Trump’s re-industrialization policies.  You could also have a lot of fun marketing these products, using nostalgia and an appeal to patriotism to hearken back to when America produced products the world wanted.  A lot of potential here.

                An amazing amount of real wealth (not based on financial ponzi schemes) could be created by doing this. Why don’t the aspiring John Galts of the world do it? Well, I think the basic answer is that the US economy’s tightly interlocking network of government regulations and giant corporations has grown so large and all-encompassing that making any kind of straightforward product is basically illegal. I think we’re really close to the point of being as inflexible and inefficient as any Communist bloc nation was except that we still allow price signals to (sort of) exist. Then again they tried allowing that in the USSR and other places and it didn’t save the system.That said, I really do wish the Trump team well in their re-industrialization efforts but what they’re attempting is essentially on the scale of dismantling the Soviet system. This is why the Lefties are going insane. They realize that the only way the tariffs can work to bring back production and jobs is to allow businesses to actually make stuff people want without a bunch of fat woman commissars looking over their shoulders. Since a lot of Lefties’ only real skill is being a fat woman commissar, they can picture themselves making hamburgers alongside a 4′ Guatemalan.

        Another thing about eBooks which is frequently overlooked is eBooks can and will be edited for content, presumably to not offend the perpetually offended, while your hard copy is the same as it was when it was printed. Of course this assumes one has a fairly old hard copy, i.e. one that was printed before the modern mania of correcting the ‘mistakes’ in the original.

        This is one of these traps that can wreck a company. VW committed to an electric cars only future only to see the company go down. They had the emissions cheat scandal on top, but falling for the electric boogaloo car did not help. I think Ford made the same mistake.Another thing that will prove to be a mistake is the elimination of cheap sedans and the proliferation of expensive SUVs and pick up trucks. There’s a perpetual market for a Corolla and Toyota knows it. Ford elimination of the Focus was a crime.They’ll push hybrids as a way to compromise, but I believe there is still space for a good ICE engine in the future. One science fiction way is to recapture carbon in the form of gasoline to close the cycle. The recycling cycle for EVs is a mess and they still are responsible for emissions at the factory.Mad Max future will run on guzoline.

                Not so smart.  They moved to turbo engines and destroyed the reliability of their trucks and SUVs.  We love Toyota dependability, but only in 2010 – 2019 vehicles.  Depending on model, this excludes the absolute worst of the tech excesses but includes reliable v6 and v8 engines.

        Everything you say about EVs is correct. But I disagree with you about eBooks. I bought my first Kindle a couple days after Christmas of 2013 and it was an immediate personal technological revolution. I could buy everything on-line no matter where I was, particularly in a non-English speaking country. The number of times I have been in bookstores since that time can be counted on my fingers. There is also a lot of self-published novels that are in eBook format that is hard to find in print. Given that there appears to be a leftist jihad in the publishing industry against masculinity, the really good spy novels are all self-published these days (in eBook format).

            Agreed, I use Kindle for my new pulp fiction library. You can choose books by unknown authors that are great reads for dirt cheap. If they aren’t good just never finish them and maybe delete them, easy and cheap.
Non-fiction though, I buy hard cover because hopefully I’ll want to keep and reread or refer back to them.

                Same.  I use Kindle unlimited, because Iread very fast, for cheap and quick and crappy reads.  Serious books get hard copies.  Even the cheap pulp ones are losing their appeal – doesn’t matter what I pick (sci fi/SHTF/time travel/military) – authors who were previouslyreliable are now sticking in IKAGOs and sexual degeneracy everywhere.

            I prefer eBooks because I’m in my 70’s and most print books have font sizes and line spacings that I just can’t comfortably read, even with reading glasses. The eBook lets me adjust the font size and line spacing so that it’s not too small, not too big, but just right.

That is because they solve a problem for the same people who prefer carrying a phone or tablet to using a desktop PC: they can carry their entire library around with them (and can acquire most books at a fraction of the cost of a dead-tree library). This was formerly not practical for average folks (unless they have the storage space and a train of coolies), but is something a lot of people want. [And the various pirate libraries solve the problem of “can be remotely disabled.”]Conversely EVs do not solve an otherwise-insoluble problem, and for most people provide neither superior convenience nor cost benefits.Tony’s Garage on YT has been going on about how the long-solved-problem of easily-repaired old cars is becoming the problem of new cars that (for practical purposes) cannot be repaired or rebuilt, and have a much-reduced lifespan (largely due to unsolving the problem of cylinder wear). He cites a recent estimate on a Toyota transmission replacement that ran to $27,000 — half the cost of the same vehicle new (and why did it need one so soon anyway??) Thank you, EPA regs that mandate XX-high MPG, which because IC engines are as efficient as they can get, can only be achieved by reducing weight, with the attendant durability problems.

        “especially when the total cost of ownership remains significantly higher than conventional vehicles.”I was in Mexico four months back. A Chinese BYD can be had for around $20,000. In fact there was a showroom right next to my hotel. One third of the cars sold in Mexico in 2024 were electric and we can safely assume 100% of them were Chinese (as you’d have to be a lunatic to pay three times that much for a Tesla).“Other car makers are going down this same path. Soon, features like heated seats will be software as a service, meaning you must get permission to use them. The eclectic car is the face of this dystopian future of man and machine.”Agreed. I prefer the older cars which have little or no software. My car key, which has a chip, broke a few days ago and the new one had to be programmed. Old car keys did not cost so much. I understand that Midwestern farmers have been hiring Ukrainian programmers in the past to circumvent software bugs and obstacles in the John Deere equipment they have bought.

            Right. The BYD thing just shows that recent US policy was all about creating a price umbrella for US manufacturers to get up the learning curve on low/moderately-priced EVs. Even with this protection, they failed. So now Canada and US tariffed the BYD cars. I understand that Trump is trying to bring jobs back here, but the predicate is that US companies can execute basic technology and so far many are failing. I hope these tariffs work but I’m skeptical.

                Couldn’t agree with you more. The tariffs are there to give continuing support to US companies like Tesla. But I don’t think they’ll ever be able to compete with Chinese companies on a level playing field. It’s not entirely the fault of the companies — the cost structure of doing business in the USA is just too high. As with electric cars so also with things like these new large-language models (AI). Of course the American consumer has to foot the bill in terms of high-priced US goods and even higher-priced imports.

                There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of foreign passengers asking DiDi (PRC equivalent of Uber) owner drivers about the economics of their EVs.Turns out it’s a no-brainer for any kind of high density urban operation. EVs are far more economical to purchase and run than IC vehicles. One might think that recharge time is an issue but it isn’t with fast chargers (and likely to get better if the current BYD breakthrough isn’t hype). There’s a whole microeconomy around snack stalls and, coffee shops etc. for drivers on charging breaks. There are also some vehicles which have quickly swappable batteries on a subscription plan.Would not work in the current USA or Rest of the West because base load generation has been hamstrung thanks to the Green Insanity and the power grids themselves are quite rickety due to MBAs and not engineers having all the decision making power.I’ll add that Chinese EV take up in SE Asia is big. I am sure that some of that is due to favourable credit terms and aggressive pricing, but even there the fact that they *can* afford to push them hard should be a message in itself.None of this is to diss anyone’s F150 and the great wide open spaces. Horses for courses. But hope and cope and automatic dismissiveness of Not Invented Here is no way forward.

        In the past the things you bought were “honest” things.  They were designed to do a job and that was it.  Now with digital technology piece of crap you buy has its own digital will.  It can enforce subscriptions, it can enforce a maintenance schedule, it can spy on you and terminate service.  It can punish you for certain behaviors.   Instead of demand driving supply of electricity, with smart meters the electric company can use reverse market pressure to change your usage behavior.  We are entering the times of the digital favela.

        This claim of a 5 minute charge is based on charging at the rate of 1MW.  A 10 stall charger would need 12MW service (which ain’t cheap) or, more likely, charging will be throttled when multiple cars are charging at the stall.  Having megawatt loads randomly turn on at various hours of the day would drive up the cost considerably.  Every thousand chargers in a city, if they were all being used simultaneously would need their own large nuclear reactor. This would certainly go up as more of the population started driving EVs. People living in apartments and row homes and others without off street parking will need fast charging.Currently the US uses about 350 million gallons of gasoline a day.  All the infrastructure to do this has long since been paid for and only occurs maintenance costs and occasional replacement.  This infrastructure was built over a long period of time.  An EV infrastructure doesn’t exist and has to be built, quickly. Even now, in many places and times, charging an EV is more expensive than filling the tank.  The more EVs that are sold, the more this will be the case. Electricity demand will go up and gasoline demand will go down.

                PRC has huge coal reserves, sucks in a lot of offshore gas, and has a bunch of nuclear power stations and is continuing to build them out. They’ve also been building giant solar arrays in the Gobi desert and the HVDC transmission systems to get this output to the high demand seaboard regions.No expert but I reckon the only reason China imports any coal at all is because it’s probably cheaper to have it delivered from (say) East Coat Australia to a power station in Fujian by ship than transport it by rail from Inner Mongolia.You’ll see some wind power in China, but it’s mostly for decoration. Local governments will stick a few windmills on a hill to meet some BS ‘Green’ KPIs. Solar is another thing entirely. There are very big projects and this has forced me to update my priors a bit –&gt; Wind power subsidy grift BS, Solar at scale must be seriously viable for some applications.China has had to put really a lot of money into a modern power grid system with much emphasis long distance transmission because the coal is found in remote inland places and the demand is on the coast. An advantage of starting out late and playing catchup is that they don’t have all this antiquated legacy technology baked in and have fewer problems with grid synchronisation, etc. Also the more modern your grid is and the more 5G’ed up you are, the more advanced your dynamic routing and pricing models can be.

            ur doin something wrong.  1,000,000 watts (1 megawatt) at 480v is 2100 amps.  At 480v w a 10 foot run, that would require 8x 750kcmil conductors, which would be a round cable about 4 inches thick, which would cost like $3,000 just for the wire.  No NEC connectors are available for that. You are describing a neighborhood substation load, not even possible in a residence.are you trying to say its 1 kilowatt/hr load? ppl mix up the greek K with latin M as 1,000. then some tards use M for million, and mess everyone up.

                According to the articles I’ve seen on it, it’s with the charging putting out 1 megawatt (1000 kilowatts).  Most public charging areas have many chargers, say 8 to 10.  If all of them are 1megawatt chargers, that’s a lot of power.  Since they are not going to install such an expensive hookup, it’s gonna throttle people if the station gets busy.  I agree with you the whole set up will get expensive with or without throttling.  It would likely be the most expensive per kw charger in the city.  I certainly was not implying you would see 1MW chargers in people’s homes.  However, a lot of people cannot charge at home.  Row homes, apartments, condos and others simply don’t have anywhere to charge and would presumably have to use public fast chargers.  In the event they really take over, this would massively drive up utilization of fast chargers.From what I understand, China uses exorbitant fees to register a real car and a nominal fee to register an EV.  They are really pushing it in China because of the oil situation and in the event of a war with the US it won’t be as easy to cripple their economy, though they do import a lot of coal by boat which would be vulnerable.

                    Read the Zh article. They appear to use two charging points, 1000v system, and a “peak” 1 megawatt throughput. Which probably means 20 seconds of 800kw, 0.5 seconds of 1000kw, and 4.5 minutes of 400kw.  Still huge power, likely minimum 1000 amp service; thats large commercial/light industrial that would be hard to do on the US grid other than in major metro areas, and as Tars says, unlikely in the vast majority of US residences. Jury’s still out about residences in Barsoom, but he would know.ive seen a residence w 800 amp service (for evs), utility connection fee was $50k and primary service equipment was $30k. Not a lot of us can afford $80,000 just to be able to charge our $130,000 vehicle.

                        AFAIK, most residential chargers are around 7.2kW on a 240 line (level 2, it’s called IIRC), less or more depending on service and the circuit.  Level 1, I’m pretty sure is like 1500 watts, a 120 at 13amps.Really, if you have a garage, 7.2kW is enough.  That’s 72kWh overnight.  If you do 95% of your driving like most other people and you have the garage, this is good enough and is the most favorable use case.  For now, it’s cheaper than gas.  But I expect that to change.  Even on slow charge, we’re talking 350 million gallons of gas a day equivalent (that’s how much gas we use currently to run our cars) .  Though it is not a 1 to 1 comparison due to the lower efficiency of gas vehicles, most generating stations are only a little more efficient than gasoline engines.  Much of our generation is about 40% efficient vs around 25% or so for gas engines.  That’s a lot of new generation and the lines to transport it.

        Back when electric cars were still cool, the weight issue was mostly ignored. Best as I can tell it still is. Even here, Zman didn’t bring it up. The average electric vehicle weighs 50-100% more than its ICE counterpart. Parking garages weren’t designed for that. You might have heard about the one in Ottawa that collapsed recently. If they really wanted to crush Elon’s company, you’d think they’d hurry up and cite that as the cause. If and as EVs become more ubiquitous you should think more about where you park.Personally I have a problem with the question and cost of battery longetivity. Do they make a model that can last 20 trouble free years like a Toyota or Honda? I haven’t heard about it. I believe this is a problem with “hybrid” cars also. A decade ago I used to see the Toyota Prius everywhere. Now I don’t see any. (as opposed to other Toyota models of a similar age which you still see). Thus, both my vehicles are 100% ICE.

            Hybrids could soar if manufacturers solve the battery life and recharging problems. They also need to avoid the trap of designing their hybrids for social workers and white librarians. Instead, make hybrids that a healthy man wouldn’t be ashamed to drive. An electric motor can improve acceleration greatly at low speeds without an oversized ICE, one unneeded for urban driving. The ICE can charge the battery on the go, of course, but it needs to recharge quickly for stop &amp; go driving, or performance will suffer. (I’m assuming a small battery, hence low mass and limited charge capacity.) Frequent discharges and recharges, however, are very hard on batteries. Probably Tesla will experiment with hybrids like this.

                I rented a V6-hybrid RAM 1500 while my car was in the shop a few months ago. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, even though the size of the truck was a poor fit for my life long-term.

            Vehicle weight in general is a huge and ignored issue. EVs are just ridiculous – these vehicles just destroy roads, especially in cold-weather regions. Crashes are obviously more serious, due to weight and battery fire risk. Tire wear is another issue. Meanwhile, BMW i4 EV curb weight is around 4700 lbs !! No wonder they cannot give them away.

            I also noticed the weight issues with EVs were overlooked.
EV weight drives up running costs for a couple reasons. First are the expensive special EV tires that can handle the weight. Of course, those don’t last, so they must be replaced more frequently than is typical on an ICE vehicle.
The same applies to brakes. The extra EV weight chews through pads and rotors, so those also must be replaced more frequently than is typical.

                What??? They haven’t incorporated regenerative braking yet? Seems that would be the ideal place to implement them, when you can juice the controllers enough to put the EV into a 4-wheel skid. But have fast enough electronics to hold just short of that.

I believe Tesla has regenerative braking.
They still go through pads and rotors quite quickly due to all the extra weight from the battery.

            “Do they make a model that can last 20 trouble free years like a Toyota or Honda?”Not for 20 years as the track record is not that long.  In any event the question is ill posed.  The real question is better put, will the auto last longer than the battery?  Then we get into the disposable automobile argument.Not to beg the question, all EV’s come with a mandatory 8 year warranty on the battery.  Independent tests of the “charge, discharge recharge” type show—last I looked—good expectation of usable battery life up to 14 years.  However, as with ICE vehicles, the user—not the vehicle—is the most important factory in battery life.  How many of those vaunted Toyotas and Hondas last without adequate oil changes?

        My elevator speech on electric vehicles is this:They cost twice as much as an internal combustion engine car.They WEIGH nearly twice as much as an ICE car. My wife has a van and a Tesla 3 (about the size of a Honda Civic) is only an eyelash lighter than her van.They go half as far and the range estimates are exactly that, an estimate. Most of the time, you can count on them getting LESS range than the manufacturer’s estimates.They last half as long. A well-maintained, pre-regulatory stupidity (1990s to 2010s) Toyota will last 400k or even 500k with regular oil changes and other maintenance. Once the battery isn’t able to keep a charge, like with a cellphone, it’s as useful as tits on a boar hog.If you park your EV, the battery drains as it must be kept in a specific temperature range. When I park my car, if it had a half a tank at night, it will have the same in the morning.The danger of thermal runaway, which burns hotter than the hatred of white people by Progressives. There isn’t enough water in Christendom to put out that fire.Because they’re heavy, they eat tires like gluttons at an all-you-can-eat buffet.They damage the roads and parking structures because of that flab.They’re basically a rolling big brother connected to the usual suspect, mining your data, tracking your movements. And if Elon can give people more range in their Teslas with an update, he can certainly brick your car with another update.There is no need for them. They’re not an upgrade on the ICE cars, even with their stupid electronic nannies, 2.0 liter turbo engines, mushy CVT and 20-speed transmissions and idiotic LCD dash screens that replaced lovely old gauge clusters. They’re expensive virtual signaling.Every time I see a $100K Tesla Cybertruck, I say “there goes a village’s rich idiot.”I’m no fan of libertarians, but this guy,Eric Peters, has called the fake EV movement out for years. His arguments against these devices, as he calls them, are excellent. I think he aligns more with us politically than he’d be willing to admit.His anti-semitism column and piece about how the American “Civil War” was anything but will raise some eyebrows among normies.

        I purchased an electric bicycle at Walmart for about $450 a year and a half ago and have basically replaced the use of a car while living in the city. I know someone who has the identical model that I have and has put 12,000 miles on his ebike. If I need to replace the battery it should cost me about $150 and most of the issues that could go wrong are fixable with the help of YouTube video. The electric car may not have a big future but I would be surprised if we don’t see a lot more electric bicycles

            I wouldn’t mind an electrictrike when we have the spare change.  Useful to go the half mile to the neighbors or 3 miles to the mailbox.  I don’t know that I would try to do the 15 miles to town, especially given the corkscrew curves and no shoulder, but an ebike would be a lot quieter than the side by side.  Lots of potential uses, especially if one has a few alternate means of power generation.

        One of the car guys I follow on YouTube had a good video on where the automakers are taking this –https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KKEkUs8MTnQ&amp;pp=ygUNdG9ueSdzIGdhcmFnZQ%3D%3DHis premise is that they are shutting out the ‘tier three’ buyers. These are the folks buying used vehicles from the people how bought them when the original new car purchasers.  For example the third tier is kids getting first car or family buying second vehicle for Mom.  These cars will need repairs and replacement parts.  However, all new cars with computerization are much too expensive to fix.  He talks about cars today that cost $8,000 to replace the water pump.  Things like a wet belt replacement usually needed at 150K miles could run $20K on some models.He suggests you find a good low mileage car right now that was manufactured before 2010.

                    Word spell check has gone insane over the last few weeks. If you hit ignore, it will keep returning to the spot a few times, as if it saying, “Are you sure you do not want me to replace your word with my word?” The suggestions have become increasingly bizarre. I am going to try ChatGPT starting next week.

                If you’re using Apple stuff, the system spellcheck is about as good as they get, though its dictionary is shrinking and nudging in typical ways. Anything less “featureful” than Word will use that rather than install its own. (It rejectsfeatureful, and pretty much all 21st century marketing and management jargon, which is nice.) Nothing’s better for writing than a “minimal text editor.”
GPT has a reputation forresistancesimilar to Word’s, but versions differ. If I were looking for an “AI solution,” I’d look for something offline and open source, so you can really tell it what to do.

            Once upon a time I worked in pricing. It was always stimulating to concoct absurdly convoluted schemes for pricing and discounts with tiers, free months, and whatnot. The stated prices themselves too could look ridiculous. Believe it or not, the telcos would haggle over the price per minute of voice LD down to the ten thousandth of a dollar, though to be fair this was before zirp and Trumpbidenflation.

        Don’t forget, Sobran was a Shakespeare expert too:The real issue is not whether anti-Stratfordian views reveal the reactionary sympathies of the doubter, but whether the Shakespeare plays suggest an author of privileged background-one who not only received the best education available, but who also knew court life, traveled widely, and enjoyed other advantages beyond the reach of a man of rustic origins, however intelligent. In the end, calling the Shakespeare plays works of genius tells us very little about them. “Genius” is not an explanation. Nor is it a motive. We can’t make up the deficit in our knowledge of Shakespeare with superlatives. A Streetcar Named Desire may not be as great a play as Hamlet, but the author of Hamlet couldn’t have written it and Tennessee Williams could. This is a matter not of genius but of individuality.

        My boss is a guy in his late 30s. We’ve known each other for many years. He’s a lefty from CA and his wife is a loon. They are all into the “climate change” shit and they believe that Stephen Colbert “does a good job of presenting the facts”. Yeah…So anyway, they are big electric car freaks and they live in central Austin. Anyway, they got rid of their gas powered Audi’s and bought 2 VW electric cars coming in at a cool 77k each. Since he got the car, he has had nothing but problems. He found out recently that the car not only uses the “big” battery, but it runs on several 9v batteries. Yes, you read that correctly – 9v batteries. He admits that the car can be frustrating because the battery drains super fast as soon as you go over 55 mph. Charging takes a while and he admitted that his utility bills are a lot more expensive.I asked him what his plan was when the battery dies and he said, “I don’t know yet. Might have to just get a new car”. WTF? These people literally do these ridiculous things just to virtue signal.The crazies are getting more and more emboldened now. Keying cars and firebombing dealerships. In a sane society these people would be dealt with swiftly and with extreme prejudice such that the fear of God would be instilled in them.

1) WRT EV vs ICE there is no difference these days.  Both have all the gew-gaws—really, computerization.2) WRT EV’s, the mechanic aspects of propulsion are minimized or basically, eliminated.  Thus producing a car with minimal maintenance a potentially long life.

            If I ever manage to get out of this Blue state shithole and buy a house away from the diversity I’m going to get something I can work on myself, maybe an old 280-Z or Porsche 911. If the original specs are too tame, it’ll be fun rebuilding it with new high performance stuff. I really like that you can get 700hp from some of the inline 4 or 5 cylinder engines from Volvo or Honda. Either that or build a kit car.

        The hypercar 0-60 times on some EVs are not good for a couple reasons.
First, most of the driving public is totally unable to manage that level of performance. Even less so in the case of people who hate cars and driving, which is the case for most EV owners.
Second, is the amount of overengineering required to support a 2.5s 0-60 time. Significant amounts of cost and weight could be saved if the 0-60 times were capped at 5.5 to 6s, which is still good pickup for normal everyday driving.

        I can’t speak for other people, but I did not buy my Tesla to save the planet. And I don’t give a shit how many darkies die in the Lithium mines. I bought it to reduce the stress in my life. Except for the tires, it’s virtually maintenance free.No oil to change.No oil to leak on the driveway.No high pressure radiator to rust out and leak on the driveway, or blow the system while driving, or overheat. No water pump to fail.No transmission to break (e.g. “reverse” is just running the motor backwards). Just paid $4Gs to have the transfer case in my daughter’s    Nissan replaced.No catalytic converter to have stolen. Have you ever tried to get a cat replaced in California? Good luck with that. CA requires “special” CA rated (and registered) cats. You can’t replace it with a generic cat.No combustion fouling to worry about. Just paid another $4G to have another daughter’s VW direct injection intake decarbonized.No PCV system to clog up.No head gasket to pop and fill the cylinders with coolant. One teenage daughter has trashed two engines/cars this way.The AC system is hermetically sealed, like a home AC, so there’s no o-ring type seals for refrigerant to eventually leak out of, like with pully driven compressors.No biennial smog inspections to worry about.Sports car acceleration without the f*cking headache of a turbo, waste gate, plumbing and intercooler.Time to charge?  99% of my charging takes effectively ZERO time to charge because it’s doing it overnight in my garage while I’m sleeping. Except for occasional cross country trips, stopping at a filling station is history for me.Regarding cross country trips, as long as the battery range is greater than my bladder range, I’m fine with it. And it’s not 1hr. At a Tesla supercharger it’s about 30 minutes. Barely enough time to walk across the parking lot to the Starbucks, piss, and get a cup of coffee. Driving from Northern to Southern California I only have to stop once for a fill up.  The main Tesla “truck stop” for his is Harris Ranch due to the food, but there are pretty much Tesla superchargers everywhere.Of course, if you live in a place with harsh winters, your “mileage” may vary, but I grew up in wintry climes. That’s why I now live in California.I spent the last 40 years fixing my own cars, or shelling out big bucks to mechanics. I’m f*cking tired of it.  There are over 2000 moving parts in the drive train of an ICE vehicle. There’s only about ~200 in an EV (and no combustion temperatures involved). Electric motors last. The fridge in my garage has been in continuous operation for 40 years now (I bought it new) and the compressor still runs perfectly.I might consider buying a special purpose ICE vehicle for things like hauling or towing (or maybe something old (pre-1960) for easy maintenance). But for daily driving I’m never buying another ICE vehicle again.

I think it worth noticing that a lot of IC cars would never reach 400,000 miles.
I think the electric car people are missing out by not adding a small single cylinder diesel engine to them. They have some free piston engines that are very light, energy effecient and powerful.

        Electric cars don’t address any problem…The energy cost of generation, and huge losses by transmission, distribution by the grid, and storage in a battery, is far higher than the energy cost of running on gasoline…And then there’s the energy wasted in the recharging process, and the fact that electric cars don’t perform in freezing weather or extreme heat…

        “None of this means the electric car is dead. There is a place for the technology, just as there is a niche for eBooks.”Certainly. What today’s missive overlooks however Is that the concept and implementation of the EV is at its early stages, whereas the ICE vehicle is at its apex. The engineering of engine and transmission in today’s ICE vehicle is ridiculously complex and expensive. Hundreds of moving parts destined to wear and to fail over time. This complexity of course due in no small part *also* to government EPA regulations.The last ICE vehicle I had used the ZF transmission, which could not even be repaired in the US, but rather was a “replaceable unit” at the cost of $9k. (A rebuilt battery for the Tesla was, last I saw, $14k. Their motors a few hundred dollars.). ZF transmissions had quite a failure rate. Similarly, for mileage/performance purposes, Ford uses—as do many manufacturers—a turbo boost engine. Failure rate is quite high from reports. (I also own one with no problems to date.)The single weak point in the EV vehicle is the battery component—which for the sake of argument, can be compared to the engine of an ICE vehicle. Battery improvements are happening quickly as BYD and Tesla are announcing regularly. There is room for great improvement—modern ICE engines, not so much. BTW, EV batteries are also recyclable in plants that now recycle ICE vehicle batteries and other forms of electro chemical contraptions.As to the economics and availability of charging, that is the second major drawback to owning a EV. Fast charging on the road is anywhere from 4x’s more expensive than electrical charging at home and up. The biggest problem being the lack of facilities and standardization of equipment. Range anxiety is really “charger” anxiety. However, as EV’s become more common, the numbers and positioning of charging stations will grow to accommodate demand. Anyone remember that with early automobiles you had to visit the local hardware store to pick up a can of gasoline? Tesla also is a leader here wrt recharging on the road. You simply program in the destination and their software tells you where and when to recharge and for how long. I have two friends who have Tesla’s, there seem to be no complaints in this regard.Is there a “niche” problem/aspect wrt to EV’s? This is perhaps less a “problem” than a phase in the rollout of the technology. According to DOT, 70-80% of all ICE vehicle use is within 30 miles of home. 10-15% of trips 50-100 miles. If one has an EV *and* one has a home base for recharging your EV vehicle, does one care about charging stations and charging time? My main use is short trips to and from local town areas. I plug the vehicle into the same a/c outlet I use for my appliances and lighting—120v—and then perhaps only once a week.My EV “fuel” is definitely cheaper than gasoline if locally charged. However, that’s not the reason—nor is “mother Gaia”—the reason I bought the vehicle. The reason, it’s fun to drive. It’s been a long time since I’ve been in a car that can do 0-60 in under 5 seconds. ;-). BTW, my new Ford (ICE) truck is currently being shipped (as of yesterday). It should come in at $10k more than the EV I bought from Ford a year ago. The EV I bought had *no* government subsidies directly to me—Ford simply reduced the price to unload it in the face of reduced demand, and it worked. Yes, cars are too damn expensive, but is that a function of EV’s vs ICE? Doubtful? My vote is to blame federal and state regulations.Finally, to those who say the electrical grid won’t hold up under more and more EV’s, perhaps you are correct. The grid needs improvement and expansion. Pretty much always has, even before EV’s. However, remember that grid use drops by 30-40% at night and that’s when I’m charging. One also saves on off hour rates.ICE vehicle proponents should not gloat too much, do you know that at times and in certain regions of the US, gasoline and diesel have to be imported—depending on demand? Yep, we have operated “on the edge” for years in this country wrt oil refining. Not much different from the predicted electricity shortages.

Sort of. As the greenies shut down baseline generation, it’s going to be a bit of a challenge topping up your EV using solar panels or windmills. That off-hour discount is a dead man walking.

        Electric cars have their benefits.  They are super quiet, safe and fast.  They are convenient.  They require no maintenance.I am not sure where you are getting your cost model from.Cost per mile for electricity is less than half cost per mile for gas.  You never have to go to the gas station because your car is full for 250-300 miles every morning.  The do go through tires more quickly though.  The average cost of a new gas car is $48-49000 while an EV is $55000.  Yes there are subsidies and maybe battery disposal fees will be significant but that is not paid by the consumer.  I understand their limitations in the cold and range and charging times are limits.  But not for 90% of driving.I don’t drive an EV but people i know who do generally like them.

            Safe, except for an accident where you got locked in the car because there ain’t a cable actuated door handle in it.  For God sake we need a law banning electrically actuated door handles.They require a ton of maintenance.  It is likely you will have to replace the battery at least once, maybe twice.  The average age of a car on the road today is just shy of 13 years.  How many 20 year old lithium batteries do you have that still work?“Cost per mile for electricity is less than half cost per mile for gas”  This is not true anymore, especially at charging stations.  The amount of new generation and upgraded electric infrastructure we will need if EVs catch on will drive the cost of electricity way up. Meanwhile, the cost of gasoline will plummet.  Most of the gasoline we produce will continue to be produced even if gas demand goes way down.  You have to produce the natural gasoline to produce diesel and kerosene and other heavier parts of the oil. There is some flexibility in how much gas you can produce, but there is a minimum you have to produce.Even with the price gap narrowing, the depreciation of EVs more than makes up for it.

                Electric doors not opening is not solely an EV thing.  We have a Lincoln ICE vehicle that needs a hidden lever in the bottom of the door to open “in case of power failure”. Fat chance finding that when you drive off a bridge. Conversely, my Mach-e fails to mechanical opening when there is a power failure.  It feels mechanical as well.

            Respectfully disagree on your “quiet, safe and fast” points.1.  Quiet?  Be great if they were, but the electric cars on my quiet suburban street have (federally mandated) obnoxious noise makers;2.  Safe?  Name a car made in the last 15 years that ISN’T safe; and,3.  Fast?  Get in an electric car and drive to the grocery store.  Do the same in a normal car.  Measure how much time each trip takes.  It is like the people who zoom from one red light to the next or constantly change lanes in rush-hour traffic.

        I have to disagree with you about the e-books. They have a couple of features that elevate them above physical books:Size of the book/device – they are lighter and smaller. I have mobility issues, and that is a big factor in my moving to e-book almost exclusively.Number of books that can be contained in that device. Less clutter in my home, less storage needed. Able to access anywhere.Ability to increase the font significantly. Wonderful for those times I’m reading in bed – I don’t have to keep my glasses on. So, when – no if – I fall asleep, my glasses don’t get dropped on the floor/lost in the bedding/deformed by my body rolling over on them.

        I know a lot of people hate electric cars. And no doubt the batteries and all the overkill electronics they put in them is a big problem. But I favor them. Why? Because you don’t have to get oil from from the middle east to run them,. You can charge up a electric car with solar power or any other vast number of electrical sources. You can cobble together some sort of charging system DIY but try to build a oil refinery in your back yard. Do I own one. No I couldn’t afford it ,but my hope is that as battery cost come down and I expect they could come WAY down. New batteries are being made of sodium and solid state batteries are being built now that charge faster, hold far more charge and don’t catch on fire. I think eventually electric will be far more cost effective. I also think it is possible that some enterprising individuals might be able to build the low cost electric car that a lot of us want. I think it would be far easier than to build a new IC car. But all the complaints about them as they exist right now are valid but they may not always be. I think it very likely that the future is very bright for electric cars even if they are far from perfect now.

        The Tesla is the ultimate Vanity purchase. The colonists building New Asia love them. They signal that they have made it and they understand the future. I suppose that could give them a bigger market. Import even more Chinese. They are coming by the townsfull so, perhaps that will keep the stock goosed and the lease and sale numbers going up. It is certainly keeping the cash purchases of home skyrocketing.And that is the grand plan after all – the fire sale is only just beginning.Anyway, all the talk of the simple drive train was silly. The battery is the drive train and I think the longest life they get is 10-12 years. Toyota made the right call.

        the current EVs are limited as you say, but the Tesla auto-drive feature seems to be a real game changer.  what is needed is a new energy technology to replace batteries.  something that converts fission directly into electricity (no heated water) would be swell.  there are such devices now (thermistors); NASA uses them to power deep space probes.  but they currently have pretty limited output.

        Vehicles going electrical is pretty much going to happen. All technology eventually  goes electrical  because it more compact, reliable and powerful. It could bebatteries (and that technology  gets better all the time) fuel cells, etc. an ICE engine is made up of hundreds of parts that have to have complex lubricating, cooling and emissions systems to function. It’s basically a bomb at the edge of blowing up or melting down without all that stuff. All the complaints about electric cars were said about gas ones early on too. They cost too much, they are unreliable, no gas stations, etc. The electricity demand problem will I suspect be solved by nuclear. You grandchildren will be quite used to it by that time. ICE technology  started in the nineteenth century. But it is reaching the limit of practical technology.i don’t own an electric car, but it’s pretty obvious what’s going to happen if you keep up with the history of technology

Ever heard ofthermal runaway? Those batteries burn like the fires of hell and can’t be extinguished. One Tesla fire in California took 55,000 gallons of water.
That amount of water would fill a corrugated steel tank  30.11 feet in diameter and 10.8 high and weighing 5,474 lbs.
A gasoline car on fire doesn’t require a third of that amount of water to contain the fire.
