        You know the next six months are going to be lit! No matter who wins the election things are just going to get crazier. I‚Äôve actually taken steps to cut back at work and just kind of enjoy myself. Seems like working myself to death on the way to the collapse might not be the best thing use of my time. Rather read all these books I‚Äôve collected and haven‚Äôt had time to read.

Happy white person and dependence day everyone!

                I backordered Ruger‚Äôs 9mm carbine and ten extra Glock mags. The mags are interchangeable between my pistol and the carbine. Good for close-in work when the rioters and looters return this autumn. Something my wife can shoot comfortably for long periods as she has my back. Ancient wisdom indeed.

                    One thing‚Äôs for sure‚Ä¶. we will lose the federal government and certainly the President. We will likely lose both the House and Senate too. As the Boomers die off, every year more and more 51% (plus) Gen-Z will be eligible to vote.

                For all the gloating about that (I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre doing it), Boomers help a lot for the sanity of our countries. They are the largest demographic that are almost all white. Every following generation is progressively smaller when it comes to what percentage white it is.Gen-X is every bit as bad as the Boomers. I cannot tell you how many people I knew as teens and young adults, who thought just as we do on all kinds of issues, but especially race, who today virtue signal on FB and the like about their black friends etc. All those middle-aged cat-women on Twitter are all Gen-X. Gen-X is the first generation that was raised from the time they were toddlers to believe in all kinds of equality and the virtue of Dr Kingberg‚Äôs color-blind society.We were the first generation to be told, en mass, that race=color. That‚Äôs why I am always banging on about how race has nothing to do with color. Because it was framed for us in that way, we were incapable of thinking through anything on the subject. After all, if skin color is just another thing like eye or hair color, it makes it sound ridiculous. It is how they got away with doing these classroom stunts of breaking up students by things like hair color and then mistreating them on that basis. Once you are stuck in the wrong frame, it is absolutely impossible to think your way out of it. They did the same thing with gender by claiming we were all the same except plumbing, as if we all have the same psyche!

                    Of course I believe race is more than skin tone and that genes influence intelligence, behavior and so on. Yet I wish it were possible to sort out people by ‚Äúthe content of their character.‚Äù Just to be able to form (and defend) communities of like-minded (not necessarily like-looking) people, while keeping the rejects out. Yes, some races have more than their share of useless or even dangerous people, but we‚Äôre not exempt. The derisive term ‚Äúwhite trash‚Äù exists for a reason üôÅ

                        Wrong, Wrong. Wrong.
Get that stupid, feel-good, pussy CivNat mentality out of your head. If you‚Äôre having moral debates in your head, then just remember that a race is simply an extended family. And family comes first. Don‚Äôt choose strangers over your own family.
Second, if it‚Äôs cold facts that you need, remember reversion to the mean. That nice black family moving into your neighborhood will have children who are more like typical blacks, i.e. stupid and violent. In a couple of generations, that nice black couple‚Äôs grandkids will be back to being thugs.

My feeling is that low IQ whites are our unfortunate brothers, who will do little harm if they are not inflamed by enemy media.
I would say anyone who requires more than say, 2 years of public assistance, must be sterilized before receiving any further assistance, otherwise, they go to a camp.

                                    But our low-IQ people could be loading trucks or otherwise doing useful work and having families and children (who will be closer to the white average than they are (1/2 way back from the average of the parents to the white average) on average). But instead they have to deal with the competition from other groups and have other groups preying on them, offering dope and glorifying thug life.The lower 50% of white people would be MUCH better off in an all white country. There is no all white country with crime and other dysfunction even close to the US. The absolute worst have children who are better behaved and do better in school than that of even well to do blacks.

                                There aren‚Äôt that many sub-85 whites, thankfully.

(All numbers approximate) Average IQ in America is 100. Blacks are 13% of the population, hispanics 18%.  Both groups sub-90 average IQ.  High-IQ minorities are less than 10% of the population.

American whites are quite intelligent.

                                    Sub85 Whites are approximately one in seven of the total.
That seems to match up pretty well with the quantity of trailer trash; which they are called for a reason.

                                        factory work, even the most repetitive, soul-crushing kind, requires a certain amount of gray matter between the ears.  You have to understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind your job to avoid screwing it up.
These sorts of jobs are typically inhabited by people in the 86-100 standard deviation of the bell curve.
Sub85s are the type that do meth, live off the government, and breed with joggers.
ill happily accept factory workers, secretaries, and Uber drivers in our thing.  I‚Äôve got no interest in coal burners who trade their EBT for tattoos.

                                    I personally can‚Äôt stand the Amren IQ nationalist crowd. That cult is as misguided as the libertarian market worshipers were. Ultimately, IQ nationalists failed at everything they ever tried ‚Äî failed to build alliances with Jews, failed to reach new people on social media (now banned on YouTube), failed at making their own ideology more acceptable (went from being broadcast on C-Span to being attacked by crowds of antifa protesters in public), supporters deplatformed at major universities ‚Ä¶Clearly, their track record of failure ‚Äî despite trying for decades ‚Äî has to be a mark against them.Better philosophy: societal cohesion ‚Äî ethnic, cultural, linguistic, political, philosophical, geographical. Within that context, the smart fraction can rise to power and work in the best interests of the nation state, their demographic and social class included. Any philosophy divorced from promoting societal cohesion leads to the present situation of disunity and chaos because even smart people can have ethnic and class loyalties that run counter to the larger national interest. Divorce the elite from wider societal loyalties and they become insular and self-destructive, dragging down society with them. IQ nationalism by itself can never work. It must always be a subset of a higher loyalty.

                                        Fellow White People‚Ä¶do listen to Creek.

                        I went to a fairly mixed high school and an even worse middle school. It was because there was a large number of blacks that it was impossible to be egalitarian about race. You had to watch everything you said.  You never knew what would cause them to fly off the handle and accuse you of racism.  They know. They couldn‚Äôt not know. They spoke about it. It was a common thing to talk about.  I see some of these very people posting BLM on their FB pages.  They have been propagandized for so long, it‚Äôs like those years just never happened.  I have no doubt Breitbart has just as many, if not more Gen-X spouting Martin Luther Kingberg‚Äôs talking points about color blind anti-racism.When it comes to feminism, I have no doubt at all that Gen-X are some of the worst offenders.  A lot of the evil done in the last 50 years has been done by feminists.  In many ways feminists are actually way worse than any race group. BLM is openly and proudly feminist. It was started by a bunch of black radical  feminists. As Steve Brule  pointed out, none of those women actually married a black man.

                    Transformation comes from mestizos, not blacks, blacks population ain‚Äôt growing.


The thing about mestizos √Æs that they ain‚Äôt that bad, meaning they don‚Äôt care to exterminate White people &amp; they are not fond of blacks.

Cartels are a problem only cause of CIA, which again leads us to The true villains, THE WESTERN ELITES.

                Watch for them to rename the days of the week (Norse gods = white supremacy) or even abandon the Gregorian calander next. Think that‚Äôs unlikely? Well, I would have said a few years ago that the left would never tear down Mount Rushmore but that‚Äôs where they are going. The democrat party‚Äôs official twitter account already denounced the monument and linked it to ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù and much of their media ‚Äî the NYT and Slate ‚Äî have done the same over the years.

        All my rentals are in suburban communities that have been destroyed by diversity. One particular that I was sad to see go was this little neighborhood between Morse and Dublin-Granville Rd. in Columbus. It is known as the Forest Park neighborhood and it was designed as a suburb with those winding roads and cul de sacs to suppress fast through traffic. At the center is a huge traffic circle and in the middle of the circle is a shopping center that was intended to be the community center. Grocery store, bowling alley, various other shops.It managed to maintain for a good long while. The first killer was the fact that it is within Columbus Public Schools. As the schools went Black and violent, people with options didn‚Äôt want to live within the district, but there were still Catholic schools and a certain amount of people willing to brave the diversity. But the Catholic schools have become Blacker, too, and most of the charter schools in the area are majority Black.Then a few years ago, they started dumping Somalis in the area. It destroyed the neighborhood. Untended garbage-filled yards, filth.The North Linden area a little ways south was the same thing, but 20 years earlier, destroyed by Section 8. There were projects nearby, which a lot of people didn‚Äôt want to live too close to, and also Columbus public schools, but there were a decent amount of working-class Whites who figured that a nice 3-4 bedroom house for $40-$60k was worth the effort (I was one of them back in the late ‚Äô80s and early ‚Äô90s. WE homeschooled, so didn‚Äôt care about the schools). Back in those days Columbus Alternative High School was still a good place and it was smack in the middle of North Linden.But once they shut down the projects and started offering section 8 vouchers, the ghetto streamed into North Linden.The area south of Hudson Ave was always (at least, since Blacks started moving in in the 60s-70s) pretty bad, but the dysfunction has moved many blocks north. We only own one rental south of Hudson and we simply can‚Äôt rent it to White people ‚Äî it‚Äôs not safe for them. North of Hudson, the farther north you go the nicer the neighborhood gets, but the cancer is still spreading. With the Somali invasion immediately north, it‚Äôs just sad what has happened.Northland Mall used to be at the Northern border of North Linden about 20 years ago, but even then the rot was setting in. I had a friend from work who was cornered by a Black gang at the mall and savagely beaten: He was the most stereotypically mild, gentle GoodWhite you‚Äôve ever met.What killed the mall was the apartments known as ‚ÄúUzi Alley‚Äù immediately south of the mall.The mall was shut down not long afterward, then torn down. The area stood empty for years, but now it is government buildings and has had a bit of a renaissance with a Menards and some strip malls, but the Somalis and Blacks make it hard to keep anything nice. One of my daughters lives in the area and will no longer go the Kroger there, because it is so full of Somalis who leave everything dirty and are always starting trouble.You have to fight for every step. The problem isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsuburbs‚Äù or any way people like to live. The problem is Whites being driven out by Blacks and other minorities.

        There was a time in our evolutionary history when problems such as this were promptly solved by the direct action of aggrieved individuals. But then civilization happened and societal antibodies were unleashed to prevent first-person remedy of collective pathology. Nowadays, the Left are curbing the antibodies with a passion, and once again, the door is open for a return of the natural remedy. Sometimes swinging a cudgel is more persuasive than the most eloquent quip.

        I follow some of the urban planning websites and Twitter accounts, andallof them are whistling past the demographic graveyard.That is, they have all these ideas for cozy little town centres, foot-traffic arcades, inspired alleyways, etc. But they never point out that these things canonlycome about in a country with an average IQ in triple digits. Since a lot of their recommendations are for fast-darkening western countries, they‚Äôre essentially useless.You‚Äôve probably all seen Twitter sequences where somebody posts something absolutely charming from Japan, and then some normie or shitlib asks, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we have stuff like that?‚Äù Makes you realize how deep the brainwashing goes:a lot of them really don‚Äôt see it.

            There‚Äôs a development precisely like that in the next ‚Äòburb over from me.  Narrow winding roads, quaint/kitschy little ‚Äòshoppes,‚Äô all less than a mile from the interstate.  Parking is insane (my hairdresser used to be there, and I occasionally stop at the grocery store on the development‚Äôs outskirts) and it‚Äôs filled with diversity now.  The worst possible melding of faux old world charm and modern diverse ‚Äòmurrican crass.

            Indeed. We already have plenty of cozy little town centers and charming villages. I‚Äôve been to many: baltimore, new orleans, gary Indiana, saint louis, louiville. The NE is full of them. Even out west there are numerous villages, old railroad and citrus towns in socal that are lovely reflections of American history and culture.The problem of course is that they are now full of Real Americans.Those who daydream of ‚Äúnew‚Äù infrastructure have no sense of history or demographics. We have been through all this before.But they will keep building rockets to mars and filling them with settlers from africa and then wonder why it all burns up.One word for these would be utopias: ‚Äúteens‚Äù. See you at that new open-air, pedestrian-friendly, transit-oriented, mixed-use, sustainable, LEED Gold, mall!

                Exactly!  What use is a town center when its full of muffin-top Latinas in spandex stretch pants, and other generally unhealthy people, including whites.  What if the very sight of a black person makes me ill?  Most of American town centers look like swap meets from hell.  This isn‚Äôt rural Switzerland.

            Yup. Even in gentrifying areas, eventually they will simply run out of whites. I love those cute little whitey areas, full of coffee shops and trinket stores, walkable, with parks, etc.Problem is, whites are a shrinking demographic, and those areas are fertility sinks anyways since they are 1) liberals 2) expensive.If white fertility was above replacement and higher than blacks, this gentrification process would work. Wealthier non-whites like these areas too but cannot recreate them.I‚Äôm enjoying the city as a young guy (renting) right now, but you would have to be a fool to buy property in an urban area, especially in the USA.

            Yes, they can‚Äôt mention the demographic changes of the past near-century, or they‚Äôd be out of a job pronto. I‚Äôm not in the industry, but I‚Äôd love to see an article on how the idealized (or typical realized) community (say, apartments) have evolved over the decades to meet the shall-not-be-mentioned challenges. To use an obvious example, the relatively open community, where anyone could come and go at all hours unchallenged, only works in a high-trust (e.g. White) community. Add in even a small percentage of ne‚Äôer-do-wells and suddenly the risk of being pandhandled, manhandled, robbed, raped or killed quickly changes priorities. Basic asssumptions (and desgin features) of the greater community are compromised, and changes must be found. In the future, I see de-facto or actual gated, guarded private communities with elaborate electronic surveilance, but hopefully some human, and ideally with ‚Äúuse of force‚Äù available when called for, to keep dangerous people out. Even for large areas, think shopping malls, just imagine the crimp on crime if you could 100% ID check every person in every car who comes in, and video and other surveilance was accurate enough to track their entire movements. ‚ÄúInvasion of privacy!‚Äù some will complain, but you don‚Äôt have that right when you‚Äôre out in public. If you want privacy, stay at home.

            High-IQ societies are a great capstone, but those high IQs have something more important that precedes them ‚Äì homogeneity. What these shitlibs and progs want is something they see is obviously attainable, but it‚Äôs easier to chase some nebulous objective that‚Äôll never materialize organically. They‚Äôre like women, in that they want what they can‚Äôt have. By themselves, they‚Äôd rather live in squalor and vapid gratitude than build anything. Western society, what remains of it, has become so feminized these turds should be treated accordingly.

        The Ideological Age is giving way to the Demographic Age.The old Right and old Left (think Sanders in 2016) don‚Äôt seem to realize that. The new Left with its identity politics understands the new reality, but the new Left‚Äôs ((masters)) didn‚Äôt actually want to change the world that they grew up in. They just wanted to control that old world, so ((TPTB)) are stuck in the past as well.Purely ideological debates are a luxury afforded by having a very homogeneous nations ‚Äì or countries where one group so dominates the other(s) that it doesn‚Äôt have to worry about them. Once you become multi-ethnic, every decision becomes about groups. How will changing the zoning laws impact my group vs that other group? Will it allow more of them into my area?The same is true for any political decision. Taxes, regulation, size of the military, local police issues, foreign policy, etc. They all must go through the racial debate so that each group can feel comfortable that their group‚Äôs interests are included in the final decision.Whites and Jews (and blacks for that matter) are still stuck in 1965 at worst and 1985 at best. Whites still think everything is about ideology. Jews still think that they can run their scam on a completely unaware patsy that looks and thinks like them. Blacks still think that they‚Äôre the only minority in town.But that‚Äôs all changing; indeed, has changed.Whites will figure out sooner or later that they‚Äôve lost their country and that group interests come before ideological interests. Jews will figure out that racially aware Whites aren‚Äôt so gullible and other groups, particularly Indians, are playing their game and gaining ground. Blacks are too stupid to figure out anything but will slowly notice that the people increasingly running the show (Indians, Asians, Hispanics and more racially aware Whites) just don‚Äôt care about them outside of keeping blacks out of civilized areas.Happy 4th of July. Celebrate the USA while you can.

                Whites not watching blacks play sports(meaning giving up on cable) √Æs how u defeat them. Sports √Æs where  their egos at, their pride lies in their jumping ability, If whites don‚Äôt aknowledge it, they‚Äôll GO insane cause the only thing blacks are encouraged to do as Kids √Æs play sports, If they can‚Äôt uplift their social status playing sports then they‚Äôll have to face The fact they‚Äôre nothing but a bunch of thugs.
Watching highlights of Doncic &amp; Jokic own Blacks at The game of basketball should be an exception though.

        I‚Äôm going to get all kinds of downvotes for this, but Our Thing really needs to become a kind of mirror-image Leninism, stat. Lenin has quite a bit to teach us about how to run a revolution by co-opting the ideology and structure of the ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù (use as many quotation marks as you feel that needs) parties. Few Russians in 1917 would‚Äôve swallowed the Bolshevik line, but they did bring the Bolsheviks to power on the most non-Bolshevik slogan imaginable: ‚Äúpeace and bread.‚Äù Few today would accept the slogan ‚Äúpeaceful separation into ethno-states,‚Äù but, looking around at the rapidly-accelerating clown show, they would accept ‚Äúpeace and competence.‚Äù A Bolshevik party is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what we need.

            I get your point, but the Bolsheviks hardly owned those tactics.   Those are as old as the hills.  Rather, they ‚Äúco-opted‚Äù them.  We should have no regrets using these same or similar tactics.

            Just as a military has to copy its opponents‚Äô weapons to keep up in the arms race, we‚Äôve got to learn from, and use, the informational weapons of our opponents.A lot of our guys are very complacent because ‚Äúthe truth is on our side,‚Äù but I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs not good enough.

            The model only works if you have enough resentment to fuel it already sitting in the population.It seems that the mostly traditional genetically minded individuals just do not do resentment in the same way. It may be that on a large scale it is not possible until they are so abused they have to become the powerless part of society. You also need a national scale information vector to support this view.Then you can do it. National Socialism was brought to fruition on the complete degenerecy, wrecking of the economy  and anti-native behaviours of the (((Weimar Republic))) that eventually overwhelmed society, combined with the resentment for the !st World war reparations.The current regime understand this well as they use these tools to get here. Its why the deplatforming is so strong.Most of the US has a long way to go until they get to that point.

                    True ‚Äì Lenin promised peace to the soldiers, the German army attacked units loyal to Kerensky and spared units that defected to Lenin.  Lenin also had a lot of money to spread around, and the Bolsheviks of course seized the Duma in an armed coup.My point is the Communists never really get into power on their own merits, they usually need massive outside help ‚Äì like we see today in America ‚Äì and usually do so by coup within another movement as well as massive outside help, after 1917 from other communists ‚Äì and reliably bankers.  They also usually had Western help from the media, intellectuals and said bankers.  We being democracies this often took place while other parts of the society and government were opposing, even fighting the Reds.Now it‚Äôs Americas turn, and these are our wages from the free marketplace of ideas.Ideas my ass, its organization, money, and guns that win.

        One of the common observations of Europeans who visit America, is the complete lack of real town centers.What they tend to remember is one suburb seamlessly merging into the next, to the point that is impossible to tell where one town starts and the other begins.One good example I am personally familiar with is the drive north from Los Gatos to San Francisco on El Camino Real.That road is bordered on both sides by mini shopping centers, car lots, quick change oil centers, cheap hotels, apartment blocks, gas stations, auto parts stores, convenience stores, McDonalds, KFC, Taco Bell, Walmart and Target. After about five miles it starts to repeat over and over and over.Make the mistake of turning left or right off El Camino Real, and you are quickly lost in a maze of cookie-cutter housing where the driveways are filled with cars and the sidewalks are void of any human activity.On the flip side, the Grand Canyon and your western National Parks get rave reviews!

                        No question.:-)Where Europe has Rome, Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Salamanca and Porto, America has the Grand Canyon, Brice, Zion, Mesa Verde, Carlsbad Caverns, and so much of it‚Äôs vast, untouched and expansive landscapes.To be fair, I still miss the SF Bay area. Yosemite and Lake Tahoe were two of my favorite destinations.I have to say downtown Chicago was great, Seattle is weird in a good way (used to be nice too) so  please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm talking down on America. I try to get back there every couple of years because I enjoy it so much.But Germany and Europe is my home, and like you, home always comes first.:-)

            The contrast I saw last year between Copenhagen &amp; Oslo and any American city I‚Äôve been in was ‚Äújarringly pleasant‚Äù if there‚Äôs such a phrase.In line with what James Howard Kuntsler often says, the Scandi cities make you want to be out in public, sitting outside a cafe watching people go by, enjoying the architecture, etc‚Ä¶  They are pro-social spaces.  Shops are part of the commons rather than the commons being adjunct to the shops if minded at all.American cities almost entirely lack the physical structure and framework for this, even disregarding the feral inhabitants of most American ‚Äúcommons.‚ÄùJust another element in what makes us mad &amp; miserable.

                The Scandis aren‚Äôt engaged in an internal existential political struggle for Global Empire, our elites are ‚Äì as our we.  For our precious elites ignored conquering fully and fully pacifying ‚Äì enserfing or exterminating ‚Äì their own country.   That they took for granted until 2008.  That is an error they mean to correct at all costs, we may hope their blazing incompetence has given us enough time to correct our own (Non elite whites) glaring stupidity and negligence in tending to our own country- where we live- not for long if we remain passive.

                    I have always found Norwegians to be the most ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù of any Europeans.   I have a close friend from Oslo and it‚Äôs like we grew up together. In Oslo when I visited hanging out with his friends it was like being at home.  The same interests, music, etc.   But, yes, the number of muslims was startling. They basically serve the same purpose there as Mexicans do here and do all the ‚Äúteenager‚Äù jobs.

                Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I get a sense that most US cities never really built up upon an established center. They were simply vast expansions of homes and businesses all put together in a rush to meet the demands of a massive population that was growing in an unprecedented rate.Here in Europe, we still live in cities which were started by the Romans. To this day, they all have an old city center you can easily find on any map.Of course we had the advantage of about 2,000 years, a few serious plagues and famines, and of course no shortages of wars to help manage population control.Ah, the good old days ‚ÄúBring out your dead!‚Äù

                    The city centers got gutted by the diversity over here.  In Europe, the physical plant of the city center is more enduring, but you are seeing the diversity end the social aspect of the city center as we speak.  City center market districts protected by barricades and well armed soldiers and police is a new norm over there.

                    After about 1900ish America designed new cities around the automobile, this is true.Mind you it wasn‚Äôt trashy until the 60s hit.  Go and see the old pictures.  Sure it might be crass compared to a Baroque Opera House, but hardly strip mall shitsville trash.If you look at the old Times Square we see that once even neon was classy.

                Agreed. During my two years in Germany and several trips elsewhere in Europe, you really get to appreciate the care the towns and cities receive, just as Herr Horst describes. Of course they have their seedy areas some places, probably worse since 1990s with all the ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù. Also, traffic wise there is only so much you can do with an 8-foot wide cobblestone street that is 500 years old üòÄOf endless possible trips, if you ever get the chance, try cycling in Europe. In my early 30s I did a bike &amp; camp trip in Northern Europe and it was one of the best (certainly the longest, at 2 months) trips I ever took. Unlikely I‚Äôll ever do anything like that ever again. Cities especially in Netherlands are super bike friendly; they even had separate traffic lanes and miniature traffic signals, in some üôÇ Just another way of showing that they care for the citizen, maybe even in favor of the corporation.

            Yes, Karl. It‚Äôs only partly true that the suburbs were developed to keep blacks away &amp; create livable spaces for Whites. It‚Äôs all part of the story that developers are scum and prefer this form of development. America is a capitalist nation, after all, and capitalism makes things ugly.

                That‚Äôs true. There are areas of London that are probably as dangerous as Detroit. And of course there are less than pleasant areas in most major cities everywhere in the world. There are areas of France that comes to mind, but nothing like the scale in the US.Maybe that‚Äôs part of it, America is just bigger because it is, so it seems much more obvious everywhere you go.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, If there was a Polo Loco over here I‚Äôd be first in line! üôÇ

                        Western Europe, for the most part, is in pretty good shape even with all the recent demographic changes.Now as soon as you drive east and then south, things start to get rather grim pretty fast.There are towns in East Germany that still have dirt roads. And you can‚Äôt just blame the communists, although they did a pretty good job of keeping them in the stone age compared to the west.But Albania, Slovenia, Croatia and the like will never catch up to what the west was able to accomplish. Once again, the Romans gave western Europe a big head start.Read Roman history you‚Äôll find no one wanted anything to do with those territories even 2,000 years ago.

                    London doesn‚Äôt have crime comparable to US cities especially if you recall US cops admitting that anything up to 30% to 40% violent crime  is not recorded.
Don‚Äôt know about Parisian crime rates but suspect the creation of 750+ sensitive urban zones may have involved  some serious criminal activity verging on an insurgency.It wasn‚Äôt London that required the deployment of 70% of the French army on the streets  for more than a year to keep the peace.

            I know the area well.  And each of those suburbs you describe (excluding Los Gatos and Saratoga) original ones from the 50s, are full of H1B pajeets, stuffed into 3k per month apartments built in 1960, cranking out anchor babies as fast as they can.  They‚Äôre home from Google just long enough to eat some rice and nan bread and knock up their wife.  Such is life in corporate whore America that sold its soul sometime around 1970.

        Here in the DFW ‚Äòburbs the apartments are not high towers but two or three story structures that look like townhouse blocks.  The developers build dozens of rows of them, though ‚Äì large geographical footprint.  Generally all the new H1bs and other ‚Äòdiverse‚Äô immigrants live in them until they have saved enough collectively to move into a house.  They‚Äôre still surging in here, which is why rents are astronomical.

            The town near mine is a mixture of agriculture, village green with a commercial district and some suburban enclaves. It‚Äôs an old town settled in the 1630s. Lots of old some new. There is no structure over 2 or 3 stories‚Ä¶except for a new 24 story apartment structure on the waterfront. It‚Äôs full of nuAmericans and provides shuttle service to the state capital tech and medical industrial areas. From a distance the town appears as woodland and bay coastal shorelines‚Ä¶and a monstrosity that can be seen for miles surrounded by fields, small homes and the tranquil bay. It is the type of monstrosity you find on Wilshire in LA or in Pacific Heights in SF. It‚Äôs as if NASA built an Apollo launch platform in the middle of a cornfield absent any support structures.I doubt there were any zoning law against such things because no one imagined anything like this would ever be built in their little town. In a small community like this one any reluctance can be bought off on the cheap.HUD will soon be given a green light for Sec. 8 by the Department of Reconciliation for Slavery and Segregation‚Ä¶so I would expect things like this everywhere and anywhere. Monstrosities in small semi-rural towns are an effective and efficient way to deconstruct Whiteness.https://photos.zillowstatic.com/uncropped_scaled_within_1536_1152/ISbhrhgmn9wnwo0000000000.webp

            I‚Äôve driven from Colorado to Maryland a couple of times in the past several months. One of the things that struck me was the number of cities where the new suburbs look for all the worlds like tower blocks fallen on their side. Horizontal Projects suitably adorned with narrow plastic brightly colored shutters, of course.

                Ah, the Portland Coffin.  That‚Äôs my term for them.  Use it freely though.  Here in the Oregon Soviet we have these land use rules that make it necessary to build these 4-6 floor slabs instead of actual houses.  Like all bad things that start on the West Coast it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that it‚Äôs reached the shores of the Chesapeake.My neighborhood is full of them.  They tend to be ‚Äúmixed use‚Äù structures so there are shops on the ground floor and tiny overpriced apartments above.  This provides a way for hipsters to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs just like a European‚Ä¶‚Äù The dots indicate that I never listen to a hipster long enough to know what they say after that.  The shops here were mostly fru-fru yoga studios, hairdressers, and pretentious retailers catering to people who think they are intellectuals because they own Game of Thrones in hardback.  Thankfully the virus panic wiped out most of them.  The two bars (one at the end of each block) are still open though so at least my neighbors can stay drunk between lockdowns.

        Yeah, the Strong Towns movement suffers from a number of flaws. They are correct insofar as they observe that suburbs are awful places to live and that zoning laws ‚Äì for example, rules that require massive numbers of parking spaces for any new construction- are considerably to blame for their awfulness.Yes. I would very much prefer to live in a walkable place that looks like an old Medieval village. But suburbs are refugee camps for Whites who were driven out of their cities 50 years ago and those zoning laws (while gamed by perfidious developers, I admit) serve the purpose of keeping blecqs out.Strong Towns absurd conceit is that, if we changed these rules and allowed cool villages to be built again, everything would be better. People who live in the real world know that, if we did that, blacks would invade and steal those villages, too.

                Correct. Suburbs are actually very nice places to live and raise children. There‚Äôs a reason they are so spectacularly popular and successful. Of course that too is passing, but the phenomenon for its time had a good run.

                        I agree.  The problem with villages is that you live close to others.  I want space between myself and my neighbors.
I have lived in many closely packed places.  There is always one guy who insists on cranking the Dead or Metallica at 2 AM.  Sure you can call the police, but your night is already ruined.  I‚Äôd rather avoid the entire situation.  Give me space.

                            I tend to agree. However, it is possible ‚Äî theoretically, but almost impossible with the society and, especially the laws, that we currently have ‚Äî to have voluntary communities where blasting the stereo, having weekend rentals where crowds of Melanic Hominids‚Ñ¢ gather to dance, mate, drink, use and sell drugs, fight and occasionally shoot each other, and similar argy-bargy is prohibited. The hard part is finding the like-minded people who want to live peaceably together, almost as hard as having an enforcement mechanism to boot out the duds. A person certainly has the right to seek their own happiness, but that freedom stops the moment it starts to be an inconvenience to others.Throughout my life, I‚Äôve found it amusing when people will bitch and moan that their HOA won‚Äôt let them park the RV on their property, or that they must get approval to plant a bush. But in 99.99% of the cases, these rules were in place and were available for inspection before the owner bought his property. But those are piss-ant trivial compared to the distortions and, sometimes, eventual literal destruction of communities due to the involuntary changes forced upon private property owners by: Federal or State courts, or Federal or State legislatures, both far away, and none having any stake in the community.

                        You have obviously never visited Carcassonne, France. It‚Äôs one of the coolest Medieval cities in Europe. There are a lot in Italy too that are also wonderful places to live. Rothenburg ob der Tauber is one my favorite German medieval towns. I think if you spent a little time in these places, you might change your mind about what living in a medieval town can be like.

                                        We live in the castle upon a hill in Europe. My Japanese toilet seat empties directly upon the town square below. The joy this brings ‚Äúbombing‚Äù the mostly British, Chinese and American tourists is worth the steep taxes and bribes. The locals know how to move without getting clobbered by scat, some resembling canon balls others grapeshot because ‚Ä¶ grape nuts. We eat a lot of high-fibre foodstuffs. It‚Äôs not a bad thing here in Europe.

                        Nope. Sorry, I live on a ranch. Where would I put my livestock in an urban, walkable community? There is a really crappy mini-mart (in a dry township, so it doesn‚Äôt sell beer, and it doesn‚Äôt have gas pumps) about a mile and a half away from me, a post office about a mile and 3/4 and nothing even remotely walkable after that. I think the mini-mart is a bit too close for comfort.

                        Oh, sure.  I‚Äôm originally from Newark along with many other White people.  It was a great place to live until the  riots of 1967 caused many White people to flee.

                    I‚Äôve been a suburb hater for much of my life- I grew up in the city, and found that a bit of mixed use made for a pleasant life. I never much cared for post WW II home architecture- the ‚Äúlittle boxes‚Äù that that commmie Malvina Reynolds sang about.But‚Ä¶ the city I grew up in was a city of mostly single family houses, with a few duplexes and apartment houses thrown in. My neighborhood was plotted in the 1880s, and ironically in 1884 it WAS the suburbs! Oh, and it was100% white, still is, last time I was there. It will be interesting to see if the neighborhood survives- it‚Äôs  not too far from the epicenter of rioting a month ago.I understand why many of my HS classmates chose to raise their families in the burbs, and resent attempts by the Obama gang to undo them.

                        I‚Äôve lived in many locations in my life, but mostly suburbs. Of course, the suburbs developed for many reasons, but Whties getting away from Blacks was a major component üôÇ Like everything else, this issue is researched to death, but what follows is speculation: with the gradual loss of ability to use restrictive covenants, the methods to legally segregate were reduced to wealth. It‚Äôs nice to live in our mini-estates, but there are in fact downsides, in terms of energy and resource use, wasted resources. In a parallel universe where the USA never had the changes wrought by the civil rights movement, I expect most of us would happily be living in houses or apartments half or smaller than our current abodes, probably denser housing, more urbanized, but highly civil and peaceful. Cities were invented for a reason, but the loss of control over who lives where destroyed a prime reason for wanting to live there.

                        Savannah.  54% AA, 36% ‚Äòwhite‚Äô.  Segregation is economic, with white women displaying extensive tatooing and numales/hipsters doing some urban pioneering, but not breeding competitively.  Downtown historic district drinking on the street is legal (one of two such cities in the US) and the nexus of black-on-white crime. Plenty of zones where people hang out on driveways and front porches all day, but I have noticed more down-and-out whites moving into them.

                    Automobiles don‚Äôt have desires, the people who drive them do, and that is what is being served. If you don‚Äôt like those desires, fine, but recognize that not everyone shares your preferences. Hard as it may be to believe, some of us like large green lawns, one- story rance houses, and the ability to go wherever we want to go when we want. Why do you find it so hard to believe that I don‚Äôt want to live in an old city? This is the New Urbanism equivalent of ‚ÄúFalse Consciousness‚Äù.

Farmers in Europe did not have the remote, house-in-nowhere structure like we have here. You can still see this in countless little villages ‚Äì lots of fields and, in the middle, a town where the farmers live.

                                    That was because people don‚Äôt like traveling more than a half hour to get to essentials they need on a regular basis.Before automobiles the small farm town was frequently 15 minutes away on horseback. Now my county seat, much farther, is still 15 minutes away by car. Since everyone has a car, and everything is still 15 minutes away how are we atomized?My area was organized around a small mining town. It had its own grocery story, clinic, school, etc., but after the roads began to improve and automobiles became more common, those amenities all started to move to the county seat. There‚Äôs no way you can force that little town to have all those things again. People would still drive to the county seat because there just aren‚Äôt enough people locally to make those businesses profitable. It‚Äôs just too easy for people to get to the county seat. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.About all that‚Äôs left locally is the churches, because people like local churches.

                                    Actually Spain and Ireland did exactly that. But yhey‚Äôve all moved to towns now. There are literally thousands of abandoned homes scattered across the Spanish and Irish landscapes.

                                        Most jobs are in cities. That could be handled with zoning but there are a lot of enterprises that simply would not expand into non urban areas even with zoning limits as the people that run like cities.For those few  with a decent income in a small town,  there is little to enjoy that wealth on in  that rural farming village or small town.There are those that do but I suspect many people do not want large families even including those who grew up with them.Two is plenty for most as many households have the resources needed to ensure a good standard of living and a good start for them.Also even for those who‚Äôd like more, modernity and urban living are not well situated for large families of children in general.It could in theory  be fixed but its complex and Clown World can‚Äôt fix anything.

                                        I honestly don‚Äôt know Spanish history well enough to comment. But when you drive through the country, there are abandoned homes everywhere.Ireland is the same, but that was due to the famine when they all left for America. But just like in Spain, their old stone houses still stand.

                        The Left is correct in some ways , that assumption needs to be dealt with in the long term simply because fuel is finite and declining.Of course public transit only works when its safe pleasant and properly funded and built with actual human needs in mind.Even in a hypothetical ethnostate, no one wants to ride near unmedicated mentally ill homeless, violent bangers or the like.Ultimately assuming there is repatriation I‚Äôm not sure that lower fertility is at all bad , a less crowded US with policies pushing small independent towns would make for a population more like yeoman than hive folk.

                Yes, awful, at least in my area.  One of the worst aspects is traffic. The cities are designed for massive numbers of people. Most of the infrastructure of the suburbs is absolutely inadequate for the huge numbers of people. Most of the suburbs is former farmland. Heck, much of the outer areas of the cities themselves is former farmland and suburbs. The old mansions either torn down or broken into apartments.  There are some formerly beautiful 3 and 4 story mansions in my city that were broken up into 6 separate apartments! The (formerly) private parks across the street from them are now strewn with prostitutes and needles.  Even the area I live in used to be all farmland.

            Strong Towns reminds me of R Street, Heartland and other operations that are bankrolled by corporate interests. They dress up their operations in conservative and libertarian trappings, but their real purpose is corporate lobbying. Part of their grift is to pretend to be critics of mainstream conservatism. In the case of Strong Towns, they just want the right to bulldoze your town and build tenement blocks. Developers get richer and hipsters get more space in the cities.

                And where do company towns like Hershey, or Pullman fit into the American scheme of suburbia?I understood these towns were nothing more than a scam that broke the back of American workers who were forced to buy a home they could never pay off, and buy from company stores with over priced goods so they were always indebted.

            We began building villages and towns 5000 years ago. They were centered around a town center. Neighborhoods developed that centered around neighborhood institutions such as churches and schools. As they expanded into cities the surrounded greenbelt was where you found the farms. The majority of people did not live in cities but in villages. They built their homes around a village square and the surrounding area was largely used for agriculture. This was as true for the world of Catal Huyuk as it was for ancient Athens, Rome, Paris, London, etc‚Ä¶..4850 years later we began building suburbs (not villages) not out of desire but out of a desperation to escape the flooding of our cities by undesirables. The post WWII world accelerated that trend and turned it into a way of life. Atomized enclaves where old genetic and cultural ties no longer exist. Where atomized communities interact with TV personalities more than they do their neighbors. Where culture is defined by what‚Äôs going on at the mall and the latest entertainment out of Challahwood. Where brothers are separated from brothers by 10s or 1000s of miles. Where grandparents grow old alone. Where friends are defined by activities and not history. Where TPTB can easily define what you think about and how you think about it because your roots and culture are planted an inch deep.Suburbs are unnatural. The only reason we embrace them is to escape the savagery that now overruns what our ancestors had built. BTP is absolutely correct, suburbs are White refugee relocation camps. But we‚Äôve had nowhere else to go for so long that they now seem like a paradise compared to the sorts of arrangements our ancestors had preferred for thousands of years.

                What an insightful discourse. Thank you.I just put on my science-fiction goggles and tried to imagine what white-people inner cities would look like in 2020 were there no other races involved anywhere along the line. Our Wakanda, if you will.I‚Äôm willing to bet that most of us would prefer that to atomization in the ‚Äòburbs.

                    White ghettos can be nearly as unpleasant as a Black ghetto once drugs become involved.If hypothetical future USA can keep drugs including GMO marijuana under tight control and there are jobs it won‚Äôt be as bad as now though.The key though is making sure there is work, intact  families, and few hard drugs.THis eliminates the underlying social conditions and while the medicare IQ and lower impulse control typical of the perma-poor will still be there, it  will be mutated.

                        If there‚Äôs no welfare and criminals are not indulged, hard drugs are not a problem. Many hard drugs were known to the world in 1776, yet they were not ‚Äúmade illegal.‚Äù In fact it was recognized that government had no say in the matter. The problem caused by some hard-drug users is quickly corrected by an armed populace and just laws about protecting self and property.

                    You don‚Äôt need to put on your science-fiction goggles, just head to Ireland, Scotland  or Shetland. Greenland and Iceland are pretty much all white too.And of course there‚Äôs Czech, Poland and Hungary. And they are all telling the EU to piss off when it comes for forced immigration.It looks like the US Forces are finally getting ready to leave Germany and head to Poland. Unlike the average German, the Poles still appreciate what America stands for so Americans will be quite welcome there.Not to mention the fact there are dozens of new US companies like Raytheon opening up in Poland and hiring Poles in droves! Thanks to Brexit, well trained and highly skilled Poles are leaving the UK and heading home. It‚Äôs a win-win for the Poles.

                            Plenty of hard right in poland.Relatively to USA? Yes. Relatively to western Europe, Hungary or polish population? No. Krzysztof Bosak (presidential candidate from Konfederacja) got circa 7 % votes during current elections. Good score, but a coalition of libertarians, nationalists, tradcaths and Borderlanders cannot get above 10 % in Poland if they stick only to their idealist program.I wonder how they will deal with the extra cultural enrichment?The general rule is: if you start shit and you a black or an arab, you better hope for the police to apprehend you first, especially in worse neighbourhoods.In this case, the authorities are eager to cover up or prevent any clashes (there were already brawls, rape attempts and thievery) so the image of or ‚Äúgreatest allies‚Äù goes untarnished. American soldiers are subjected to american military jurisdiction so our courts can do nothing in the matter except for investigations.

            Wait until electric cars with feck all range, no ability to store fuel and remote onboard control are the norm (like 5 years from now).Those people in suburbs are going to discover what an open prison is like. It will be semi-permanent house confinement with only Amazon deliveries, as you will have had your 5 mile allowed trip per day and that is it for you buddy. suburbs are workable only with independent transport.
Get back to your teleworking pod and wait for the beyond meat delivery.

            ‚ÄúBut suburbs are refugee camps for Whites who were driven out of their cities 50 years ago‚Ä¶‚ÄùJames Howard Kunstler never gets tired of complaining about cul de sac subdivisions and strip malls. But wasn‚Äôt that supposed to be the Capitalist/Communist paradise? Lots of cheap mass produced goods for everybody. No doubt Mr. Marohn believes that progress must march on no matter what. He simply wants to fulfill the vision of mountains of crap for everbody, even if it means destroying all the social capital in America. And so he wants to team up with the left. That‚Äôs the uniparty to a tee. Strange bedfellows. Tearing down the old to build the new is baked into the American cake, and nothing is going to change that except total failure.Oops.

                They weren‚Äôt just driven out.  Houses in the city tend to be cramped and have terrible bathrooms and kitchens.  Sometimes only one small bathroom.  Who wants to wait to use the bathroom and still have a warm toilet seat from the previous person?  Nasty.  Then you have all of the issues that old houses have, and suddenly getting the newer house outside of town makes a lot of sense.

                        Our north Dallas suburb got a bunch of them.  Along with remedial high school classes, locked cases at drug stores and locked clothes at department stores, etc.  Things we hadn‚Äôt seen in the 20 prior years ‚Äì like joggers walking aimlessly along the road or driving by with their nogger noise blaring ‚Äì became the new normal.

        This is a fine reminder of what is so evil about the ‚Äúindividualism‚Äù of the approved right.  The community in a given suburb have no rights or interest outside of their narrow individual interest as a property owner.  Therefore, their property rights are no more important than the property rights of the people wanting to bring crime, disorder and misery to their suburban neighborhoods, or, more accurates, their ‚Äúgeological zip-code‚Äù as ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù sounds like ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù and thus ‚Äúbad‚ÄùNot only will these apartment complexes and other ways of sneaking in people who don‚Äôt fit in, but they will also destroy the schools and run up spending by the locality. More littering, more crime more traffic, higher taxes.. it‚Äôs like the cities of the 60s and 70s all over again.  They will NEVER do this to a place like Martha‚Äôs Vinyard, Princeton etc.These people know what they are doing and they would viciously oppose this being done in their own areas.  It is one of worst aspects of clownworld. Not only are our areas destroyed, but the enemies of our people get rich doing it.

            The biggest fallacy about suburbs is ‚Äúgood public schools.‚Äù  This is the educational equivalent of ‚Äúa clean public restroom.‚Äù  The kids coming out of these ‚Äúgood public schools‚Äù are highly disturbed.  If you want to know when the trajectory of the country was set, it was when the first public schools opened in the 19th Century.  They exist to employ people and create pliant worker bees to be handed off to HR departments.

                Are you familiar with how Germans used to take care of their elders? They built a tiny little house next to the barn for them to live in. Then left them there until they died. Not quite the romantic family unit the Waltons brings to mind. Look up ‚ÄúAltenteil‚Äù.

                    I am generally aware of that being a tradition that was widespread throughout western Europe.  In fact it appears to me that it might also be something universal.  I know it is common among Mexican families in Southern CA.  I know it is true about my family as well; my parents took care of my grandmothers until they died.  And I plan to take care of my parents too.  I am looking for a large piece of land with a few houses on it for that purpose.  I know with my family in Italy that everyone lives essentially within a few blocks of each other, babies to great grandparents, all snuggly placed in close proximity.But I am a dying breed in America.

                Social Security helps prevent a consumption deficit caused by too much savings. Without high fertility savings past and I‚Äôm guessing here maybe 10% causes deflation pressure.More savings also comes with an inherent lower fertility rate simply because ‚Äúhave more kids and hope they‚Äôll take care of you ‚Äù makes zero sense in a mostly urban society.Instead if social security was not a thing, you might get more  annuities but those would be money chasing lower consumption rates and growth. And note annuities allowing people to retire have existed since at least the Medieval period.A last bit, the Libertarian loathing of government is caused by the false notion that since my government is bad, all government will be bad.Now if the US can even with a very White population never manage high cooperation , high trust and effective government , we‚Äôll need to lower our development levels since those traits are required for an advanced society.

        These ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù have been getting away with this forever because the average voter, not right or left, is an imbecile.  This is where the right wing fallacy disintegrates.   The Rush Limbaugh‚Äôs of the world (rest in peace, any day now, just like conservatism) will say, ‚Äúthe American people will make the right decision every time if they‚Äôre informed.‚Äù  Ha!  No they won‚Äôt, and what is ‚Äúinformed.?‚Äù   One thing you can always count on, and people like Mencken, educated in a different world, once knew, is that it is the voter that‚Äôs the problem.  When Jesus said ‚Äúfeed my sheep‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt a euphemism.  About 80% of the population is moronic and has to be told what to do and what to believe by the 20% who aren‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs being charitable.  This country could make it if it stuck to a highly limited voting franchise among a highly monolithic population.  Today it doesn‚Äôt have a prayer.  Human beings are born to be controlled by what Jefferson called a ‚Äúnatural aristocracy.‚Äù  The left, as deranged as it is, has no problems arranging itself this way.  At no time does the left wing professor encourage ‚Äúfree thought‚Äù unless it‚Äôs down a carefully curated corridor built by the left.  The right wing walks down the corridors the left built, moving furniture within them, that the left puts back in place a couple years later.  If anything, the left is the true heir of medieval feudalism.  There‚Äôs really nothing that can be done until the country is impaired by external shocks combined with the poor decisions of the nepotistic faux elite that runs the show.  The fruits of nepotism, combined with external shocks will give us a fighting chance.

            I enjoy your posts and this one is no exception. You‚Äôre considerably more optimistic than me however. Foreign influence, including China and the European elite, will be arming the left with everything shy of ICBMs, CVNs and SSNs. They want us dead and erased. Unless our left implodes soon and we get a strong man in charge we are doomed. Hope you‚Äôre correct and I am mistaken but that‚Äôs my read. Enjoy the moment.

        I‚Äôm watching this happen all around me. I‚Äôm in an suburb of Los Angeles, about twenty some miles outside of the city. For the past decade I‚Äôve seen failed businesses, bought up and turned into massive high density tenements. This is going on all over the Southland. The town next door to us is very busy plowing down the old neighborhoods, and replacing them with these monstrosities. In our town they shot down plans to put up a Motel Six along the boulevard. There was a huge astro-turffed anti-motel ruckus warning everyone about the tweakers, and junkies that would fill the streets. Whatdoyaknow. The Motel Six wasn‚Äôt built, and over a thousand apartments are taking its place. And along with the tenements comes the diversity.  And along with the diversity comes the crime, and blight. Right here. Right in my own town. I recently learned that the family owned nursery at the end of my street will be sold, and I have thousands of new neighbors coming in to fill the gap. My family always held on to the lower edge of the middle class by the skin of our teeth. We worked hard, and I‚Äôm the third generation to live in the home I now own. I‚Äôve always loved our little corner of So Cal, but it‚Äôs dying. I don‚Äôt want to leave, but the writing is on the wall in spray paint. My wife and I are making plans to get out.JWM

            Get out now. Sell all your stuff or pay 10-20 thousand to move it. The move from CA is painful (you are being driven out, after all) but you will breathe a sigh of relief once the move is over. BTW, make sure you do plenty of research on your destination.

            Motel 6‚Äôs in SoCal are the preferred ‚ÄúMyOffice‚Äù space for crack-dealers, hookers &amp; trenchcoat pedo-types.  They are also the new hotness for Jeet ‚Äúinnovators‚Äù looking for a piece of ‚ÄúAmerica ‚Äì the Looting Phase.‚Äù
Adding insult to injury, not one dime of that crack-dealer hooker pedo cash is going to circulate in your community.  It‚Äôs going back to Mumbai as remittances and into the thongs of Pure Platinum dancers who show bobs.
If one is slated for your neighborhood, GTFO before it becomes common knowledge &amp; tanks your property values.

        One smart thing a small rural town can do is never, ever build a water / sewer system.  This makes it a necessity to require acre+ lots for homes because they‚Äôll need a well and septic tank.  And it helps fight off plans for cheap apartments.

            Wells, septic tanks, and acres in a rural setting are exactly what we need.  IQ, situational awareness, a real world skill set, and neighbors depending on each other is a great recipe for self-segregation of the capable.  Suburbs are done, as the powers-that-be are gunning for them, and they are considered aspirational by a bunch of the low lifes.  Those same people want nothing to do with rural living, which is just fine by me.

        the wrong side lost in ww2. thus the right was purged off its legitimate defenders of tradition, in the name of postwar peace. so the useless libertarians were chosen to be the leaders of the fake right. true, the commies would say the same about socialdemocrats, but at least the latter put their spaced-out commie cousins in the colleges to keep them happy ‚Äì and wreak havoc in the long run. meanwhile conservatives treat their legit trad-realist nephews like idiots because they don‚Äôt worship Rand nor Reagan‚Ä¶speaking of tradition, went to see some statues today [wherever i may live] of several races, and the white ones have been cleaned up at least. one still had cops and police tape around it, which is good for it is the most important one; but makes me fear for the others though, specially one in a more open spot looking at traffic. meanwhile the more important statue with (laughing) cops and tape around also seemed a bit surprisingly hidden and separated; it seems way-back in the day it used to be in a more open spot, now replaced by a modern vegas-style fountain, now turned off bc plandemic. now in the more recent place, cars park near and benches and decor are more humble, although it is still nice to walk by. but yes, no wonder we lose, if we shuffle around and leave our statues to pigeons and homeless piss. then again, those of the nonwhites were surrounded by even more bums.at any rate, after my quick prayers of thanksgiving and asking for mutual forgiveness and survival of the races (which would require separation for most) around the statues, one skinny vato horde member seemed to be following me around for a bit on a bike, but not much else. there did seem to be some more soyboys posted near white statues though, even though walking around some of these green areas was technically forbidden except the small food court (go figure, the woke virus attacks people who exercise outdoors but leaves alone muzzled consumers in semi-crowded indoors). i fear specially for that certain statue near traffic, although then again this higher visibility may help prompt law enforcement response‚Ä¶ if they so desire to respond, that is.so, the threat is not over‚Ä¶ just a still in the fighting, waiting for another spark. which they will provoke regardless of our actions. ergo, these actions should be as peaceful and friendly resistance as possible, without forgetting the word resistance.

        At the heart of it all is property rights. This leads to many things, but the right of association is a key.To build a good place to live, raise a family, worship God as you see fit, live as a free man, and more; you need to be around people like yourself.It was said by the old timers in the Appalachian mountains that those who refused to get along with the ‚Äúcommunity standards‚Äù would be burnt out or killed. Some say that was immoral, but building a community that was fit for family and to raise children is the moral imperative.The community should be town sized or smaller in my view; only because I think knowing most everyone helps to keep people acting right. ‚Äî&gt; ‚ÄúWhat would the neighbors think?‚ÄùAs soon as you depend on government to do all of these things you are on your way to disaster. It might take a long while but con men will rule you and yours before it is over.Oh, and if you are not willing to commit violence to defend your family; well, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.

            Politely disagree. Property rights means dense housing in small towns. Traditional white families must take precedence.
I live in a Red State small town Whitopia, which will be unlivable in 10 years because all the Reagan conservatives worship property rights, which means the right to sell your farm to a developer who will put in high density apartments.
In the last mayorial election, I posted, ‚ÄúWho is the NO GROWTH candidate? Not smart growth but NO GROWTH?‚Äù The Reagan conservatives attacked me like locusts, ‚ÄúWho are you to tell me what I can do with my property?!‚Äù

                The option that you lobby for then is to let the state control private property. Than means diversity and no place at all for whites to call their own.
There is no final answer unless those of like mind band together in certain areas. That involves individual property rights. And that will not work forever; you must also be willing to commit violence upon that individual/group trying to destroy your way of life.
You will never vote your way to heaven on earth. That I can promise you.

                        He is rich. No kidding, seriously rich! The Swiss government pays tons of money to support their farmers. Do you have any idea how much he makes for just mowing his lawn twice a year?And that‚Äôs exactly why Switzerland looks like that.Plus the fact they shipped all the impoverished dregs of Swiss society to the USA. They literally gave them a paid one-way ticket to America to get rid of them.

                I was with a group of teachers in the National Park just above Gatlinburg in the early 90s, and 3 Canadians crossed a field towards a mama bear and her cubs. They got way to close. The mama bear charged towards the idiots and I pulled a 9mm to save the fools.
Luckily they ran like hell and the bear was satisfied and stopped, went back to cubs, and it was over.
I would have destroyed the bear if I had to, and that is a felony in the park. But sometimes violence is the only option.

        The Conservatism brand lost any vitality it once had when it became an ‚Äúanti-‚Äù machine. ‚ÄúReactionary‚Äù is Marxist language, but the Certified Conservative industry has long done its best to live up to the label. It exists first to provide income for members of the cuck class, but also toreact. In that lies its undoing.There‚Äôs a lot of talk on all sides about ‚Äúresisting,‚Äù but that is effective only for very limited and specific goals. It can never be a final victory even when it looks successful, because the opposition to the Conservatism Corp. ‚Äî the left, the globohomo establishment, the deep state ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt concede. It just waits for another opportunity. Look at the series of fanatical TDS campaigns, including Russiagate, the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, the BLM / Antifa local takeovers.A person who is centered within him- or herself doesn‚Äôt adopt ideologies by pingback from enemies. It is futile in the big picture to take absolute positions by negating those of others.

            I‚Äôm quite in favor of this. The liberal Karens do not only live in the cities. There are plenty of virtue signalers in the ‚Äòburbs too. It isveryimportant that people feel the consequences of their actions directly, in real time.When Tyrone and Laquesha move in next door and start blasting hip-hop 24 hours a day/night through your nice suburb as well as hosting the ‚Äòtwerk party‚Äô on the deck you are going to get your cherished diversity and inclusion good &amp; hard, which is just the way Karen needs it.Anecdote Time:White women need to be shackled because without them none of this shit would be happening. In the past week I‚Äôve had 2 friends share stories of their wives completely dominating them by throwing temper tantrums when they didn‚Äôt get their way and in one case belittling the guy in front of his own kid. They do nothing, they slink away balls shriveled tail tucked. It disgusts me and it iseverywhere.Another one was saying he sort of understands that BLM is rayciss and Marxist but his Little Princess Daughter supports them and of course, he wouldn‚Äôt want to break her wittle heart! (She‚Äôs in college btw). You understand now why this society is destroyed? I fucking marvel at the white males around me they truly are soy infused manlets for the most part. (Again, DC area so maybe that skews my perception)p.s. Have you noticed thedeafeningsilence from Repubs even after Tucker Carlson pulled their card night after night on live TV? Not one released a statement to refute his points. They are just slinking around on their bellies. Vote all those MFers out as soon as possible, they are as emasculated as my friends I just described above.

                        Really?
Four years in and we have massive unemployment, a fake virus with country wide house arrest, black worship, white persecution and larger migration than when he started.
What part of this could be in a worse shape?
Perhaps a couple of city wide nukes just to finish off the fuck up Trump has been on the country. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I do not think the alternatives are any different. But Trump‚Äôs complicitness or cowardice is indefensible.
But heh we got a new cold war with China.

                            yeah got downvoted here 2 yeas ago for saying Trump would prove to be one of the least consequential presidents ever.  looks like I was right, hasn‚Äôt done anything . I guess that is better than getting America into 2 wars as Bush did, but was hoping for more, too.

                Yep, things are getting pretty damn tense in my abode on just these issues. I don‚Äôt back down and let me views be known, but I boxed myself in years ago without even knowing it. Moving the family to a nice, i.e. White, neighborhood gave the women in my world carte blanche to believe all kinds of stupid shi$.The only real way to get through to them would be to move them to a diverse neighborhood, which is, more or less, the nuclear option, one that I‚Äôve seriously considered, which scared my wife. However, the truth is that she‚Äôd divorce me before that happened, and my then-ex would just use my money to stay in the same area until the kids were out of high school.White fathers trying to do the right thing have inadvertently screwed themselves. So, I say bring the diversity to the burbs. Make the Karens and the Beckys live by their idiotic slogans.Side story, but on topic. Was driving my daughter and a friend someplace the other day. The White friend spits out a typical stupid line about having a ‚Äúfirst world problem‚Äù but decides to say ‚Äúfirst world, White person problem.‚Äù I stopped her and said calmly but with a hint of seriousness, ‚ÄúWhat do you have against White people? Why would you single us out?‚ÄùThe face dropped. I would suspect that she‚Äôs never once in her life had even the tiniest of push back for saying something against Whites, and typically was rewarded. She literally couldn‚Äôt speak, just sat there with mouth half open. Finally, said that she didn‚Äôt mean anything.These upper-middle class White women and girls truly live in a gilded bubble, even more so than blacks who generally have to live around other blacks. It‚Äôs high time that this bubble get burst.

                Woman was just recorded being a ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù in my town by a black person. Wife started harping on the Karen for being ‚Äúracist,‚Äù saying she deserves it. ‚ÄúUntil they point the camera at you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúUntil you flip the wrong person off or bump into a black person at Walmart. Then, after we‚Äôre both fired and reduced to begging and welfare, you‚Äôll come to ask me what happened. I‚Äôll tell you what happened: normalization through media, like the video you‚Äôre watching for entertainment. You think that it‚Äôll never be you and you‚Äôre wrong. You think it has something to do with ‚Äònot being racist.‚Äô It doesn‚Äôt. Get your head out of your ass.‚Äù She eventually gave it up and slunk away. Hopefully, I got through to her.If you smell one atom of antiwhite anything on your woman, fight her tooth and nail. Wake them up. White women think they‚Äôre safe as long as they stay on the good side. They‚Äôre not. In fact, they‚Äôre in more danger than white men because they‚Äôre not used to being on the receiving end of this political climate.

                        I watched my white, blonde fianc√©e at the time try to #MeToo a young man back in late 2005.

Then she tried to make false accusations against me when I left her in 2006.

Luckily, I withstood her gaslighting and there was zero physical proof of her claims.

Obviously, I never should have let the relationship go so far, but I was much younger and dumber then.

        Off topic? Maybe. Tom Luongo on the arrest and possible imminent death of Ms. Maxwell:‚ÄúIf anything, what‚Äôs happening here is that Trump and Barr keep pushing the tempo against the people who are trying to remove him from office by any means necessary. Maxwell‚Äôs arrest could be a dare to them to kill her too to protect themselves, again. It‚Äôs also, in my opinion, a signal that Trump isn‚Äôt going down without a fight and that he may be at the point where he‚Äôs willing to burn the entire rotten edifice down on his way out the door. Because at this point it should be clear to everyone that if Trump loses this November he and his family will be hounded into oblivion. Anything he‚Äôs accomplished as president, some of which is very good, in trying to reform and remake the judiciary and federal agencies, will be undone within days of his leaving office.‚ÄùRead the whole thing,especially you Trump-hasn‚Äôt-done-anything grumblers.

        Trump at Rushmore; Trump is running against The Left, which certainly makes sense.He‚Äôs also speaking out against the Indoctrination of our Children in schools, Truth, Justice, The American way, and really promises this time someone could go to jail for 10 years for defacing statues.  I‚Äôm sure Barr is all over it.Now he‚Äôs not the solution, he has however spoken the truth aloud, for which we should give him credit.  He shows us another  way is possible. Just possible, he‚Äôs not who leads us there, but now we know its possible.

Let them take all the credit for what they have done. Red pills are flowing anyway; imagine what the public will think when the FBI‚Äôs goon squad destroys Mount Rushmore. No need for any on our side to get involved as the enemy destroys themselves.

            I think the Rushmore event was actually a brilliant bit of theatrics and the speech was excellent and a lucid defense of our values. I was glad to hear him call out cancel culture and use the phrase ‚Äúcultural revolution‚Äù to describe what the Left is up to. It was also a good sign that he‚Äôs willing to dosomethingto stop the chaos without falling into the Left‚Äôs trap of sending in federal troops everywhere to stomp the rioters.As much as I‚Äôd love to see the fantasies of AntiFa and BLM crushed under tank treads, that‚Äôs exactly the narrative the Left and media is all geared up to use to get Biden elected ‚Äì see, we told you, Trump really is literal Hitler. Doing it this way allows Trump to rally traditional America against the Left and set himself up as defender of our history and freedoms against insane fanatics. Hopefully he has other events and executive actions planned to keep the momentum he started here going into the elections. I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic that he can be re-elected and he still has my vote.That said, I agree that he isn‚Äôt The One. Then again the societal disaster of the last 50 years wasn‚Äôt the work of one man. Undoing it and remaking America requires millions of men to stand up and lead wherever they are. Trump‚Äôs role is to provide a foothold on federal power for us while we rally and counterattack the Left. That‚Äôs all anyone should expect from him. The idea of Trump the God Emperor who would do everything for us while we sit in our mancaves watching sportsball was always fantasy.Oh and Happy Independence Day to everyone.  Now go out and flout your governor‚Äôs mask and social distancing rules!

The statue thing is going to be used to place blacks as part of the country foundations and write out the actual founders and other figures.

                    CTH?  Conservative Tree House I suppose?  I admit I might be misunderstand your post here.  Are you suggesting that Trump taking a strong stance on defending the statues is because they are planning to build some of blacks?  Well, I admit I hadn‚Äôt considered that but then it might be that I‚Äôm too ‚Äúlinear‚Äù and thus just thought that Trump talking about defending our statues meant that he wanted to defend the statues that we already have from further abuse and desecration.  If he can do that he‚Äôll have restored a semblance of order and be in a better position to win re-election.  That‚Äôs all I really expect of him.  Taking the culture back, preventing further immigration, excising social cancers like Challahwood.  Those things are our job.

                        I am not trying to be insulting. Its just frustrating people cannot see a simple coordination by two pretending opposite forcesLots of statues of Civil war era people/Columbus/other foundation figures pulled down. Renaming of lots of stuff. (Left move of the goalpost)Trump does little to nothing about this (right inaction)When this is cemented in peoples minds that this is inevitable and unsoppable there are a enough a few token arrests. (acceptance phase)Now does trump actually re-instate the torn down statues? No instead he is he gives a speech saying he is defending the staues and is going to create a new National Garden. (apparent solution to point 1 ‚Äì the bait)Instead of it being Columbus and torn down nation builders they are going to be replaced with Slavery stuff, Blacks from Civil rights, any other Noble Negro in a disproportionate number to any actual achievement. (the switch)You then have a new history where the past has been erased and your history going forwards is centered around not the foundation of your nation, but somehow that slavery was the central pivot of the whole country and blacks are prominent in something they had no impact upon.(the new normal).The point I am making is that this is a classic controlled opposition. Trump‚Äôs rhetoric topline, which you have taken away, is the opposite of the detail. He is obviously, and wilfully complicit in writing whites out of their history by this action, pretending he is doing something on your behalf and progressing the rewrite of history agenda to give blacks have a position they never had. It is therefore coordinated with the chaos angle of the step 1 forces.Its why whites are constantly getting fucked over by the GloboHomo as they cannot seem to analyse actions of constant deceit by people pretending to be their allies.This cements for me that the anti-Trump thing is the biggest pro-wrestling set up I think we have witnessed in politics.He is being used because if it was Obama you would have a ton of pushback. He is keeping you tied to the floor and you are making the chains yourself from his implied actions and ignoring his real ones.

                            Thanks for explaining more what you meant.  I thought this was a very clear exposition of the danger of Trump making another token gesture while the rug is pulled out from under us.  Yes, I do think they‚Äôre going to try to replace the destroyed statues with a bunch of blacks to rewrite history.  We need to insist that they put the original ones back and demand that Trump support the effort.  The problem with putting it all on Trump is that the President doesn‚Äôt control a lot of this.  Trump has a lot of control over any federal statues though and this is why I thought drawing a clear line around them was at least a start.We need state and local officials to put most of the statues back.  Trump can pressure them of course and perhaps even blackmail them a bit by withholding federal aid if they don‚Äôt cooperate.  If he were going to do something bold, he could make an executive power grab and just declare all public statuary federal property but that creates hassles and legal problems and also allows some future  Dem President to start replacing them all with pozzed ones.I guess I have low expectations of the guy.  I would like to see him restore enough order to get re-elected.  I don‚Äôt expect much from his 2nd term.  I just want Not-Biden in there so we at least have some kind of input at the federal level.  Ultimately, the country is still doomed and we need to prepare to carve Our Thing out of the corpse.

            Speaking of statues.  I was just thinking about 3D scanning again and wanted to throw out the idea of creating some sort of Western Cultural Preservation Society that would, among hopefully many other things, make detailed, very high quality 3D scans of public statues likely to come under attack.  Ultimately this is probably all of them but you have to start with the obvious ones.  Modern 3D printing and CNC machining in metal technology is good enough to create pretty much exact copies from the data.One way to expand this effort and make a very good but subtle propaganda point would be to focus on preservation of artwork that celebrates the Western Tradition in general, wherever located.  It‚Äôs a way of calling out the Left as the Maoist barbarians they are and get people thinking.I need to get off the intertubes and get to work now but I‚Äôll check back a few times today.  I‚Äôd love to hear what people think.

        Why aren‚Äôt any of the Republicans doing anything for us?Why isn‚Äôt Trump just going off on Twitter?  He used to be this ‚Äúbull in a china shop‚Äù, and when he should be super-pissed, he‚Äôs strangely reserved.Trump‚Äôs going to lose and blame it on the media.  Then we‚Äôll never see him again.  The election is a sham ‚Ä¶ everyone important is playing their role in this theater.  We‚Äôll have a black women prez, and then they‚Äôll start coming after Whitey with a vengeance.Also, how does a Black guy win a Republican US House seat in Utah??  His district is 85% White, and he beats the 3 other White guys running??  Haven‚Äôt the people in Utah seen the riots?  Are the White people in Utah that pathologically insane?I couldn‚Äôt be more black-pilled.

                    Its called the civilized world ‚Ä¶ maybe you should try it sometime.In this world, the gubment is supposed to ‚Äúserve and protect‚Äù, so its not unreasonable to expect for riots to be shut down.I see your point but I lean more towards BF‚Äôs point of view.  The problem overall is the ‚Äúprofessionalization‚Äù of everything including maintenance of basic order, moral instruction of children, upholding of public morals, defense of private property, etc‚Ä¶In the 2nd Amendment, for instance, there is that language about ‚Äúthe militia‚Äù that causes so much confusion among modern Americans, even nominal conservatives.  What the hell is the militia?  Oh, the National Guard?  Libshits have tried and largely failed to sell that one to people.Well, no one in the 18th century needed to have the militia explained to them.  The militia was the able bodied armed male population, that‚Äôs it.  The Supreme Court finally clarified this in recent times but why was such clarification needed at all?  It‚Äôs because everything in modern America has become transactional.  You see this in all kinds of Civnat, libertarian, and conservative rhetoric.  The idea is that I pay X in taxes and should expect Y in protection of my life and property.It‚Äôs the coin-op government.  As long as you have the change it delivers everything you need.  It protects your business, your home, educates your kids, keeps the borders secure, keeps invading armies at bay.  This is never what the Founders intended and for very good reasons.We‚Äôve seen those reasons over the last few generations.  The vending machine of government has all kinds of machinery between the coin slot and the thing that delivers the goods.  What we‚Äôve seen is that determined subversives have very patiently hijacked that machinery and now the coins actually buy pretty much the opposite of what people expect to get.  You can blame everything on the subversives but the real blame must lie in placing so much complicated machinery there to be hijacked in the first place.

        The suburbs aren‚Äôt quite what they used to be. Here on Lawn Guyland, old man Levitt literally invented the concept of the ‚Äòbedroom community‚Äô with his modest cookie-cutter tract homes for the returning GIs of WWII, a good many of whom then commuted from what used to be the boonies to NYC. Those same small 4-bedroom capes and ranch homes on a postage stamp of property now cost north of $350k in even the meanest of towns here on my dying island, half a century or more later.Worse than the hyperinflation in housing costs around these parts (my parents bought their tiny shack in western Suffolk County for a whopping 8 grand in the late 50s and sold it in the early 2000s for over $400k) is the rise of ‚Äòplanned developments‚Äô or ‚Äògated communities‚Äô as they are euphemistically referred to (guess who the gates are there to keep out). This has, in turn, given rise to the rampant Karen-ism of the lordly HOA, and has turned many a pristine woods into exclusionary clubs for the never-ending supply of poseurs and wanna-be‚Äôs that give these ‚Äòburbs such a bad name.But it has to date been wildly successful in keeping the diversity at bay. Infiltration into those sterile, hermetically-sealed White cocoons has been limited to the uppermost crust of non-Whites, who are just as eager to escape their unwashed brethren as we are. How much longer these bastions of blinding Whiteness will survive unsullied remains to be seen. When those modern brick mausoleums go Section 8, I have no idea where all the grossly overextended (White) schoolteachers and cops and engineers and nurses are going to go. Maybe back to da city?

                        You get called a fed because your suggestion is unwise and ultimately counterproductive. I understand your willingness to ‚Äúdo something‚Äù but it has to be thought through first. Those kinds of schemes of which you talk are often just honeytraps for impressionable kids. Don‚Äôt join any dubious group with idiotically stereotypical symbology or beliefs ‚Äî feds every time.Before organization can become effective, you must first have an organizational philosophy, one that won‚Äôt be rejected out of hand (blatant ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù). Example: the doctrine of Marxism preceded Leninism; Hitler wrote Mien Kampf before he was able to turn the Nazi party into a successful force. You need an organizing ideology, something like a manifesto or a bible for middling intellects to hang onto. Even L. Ron Hubbard understood this principle: create a religion by creating a masterwork, rake in the followers.A secession movement based along regional lines might very well work. It‚Äôs implicitly white and serves to deplatform the media which the poster above talks about; it makes ‚Äúthe media‚Äù the other side‚Äôs media and once we separate they can be banned from broadcasting in our territory. It might also get foreign support when the time is right.The conservative right should be seeking a zero day solution to the problem of liberalism ‚Äî just as they are doing to you ‚Äî because there isn‚Äôt any other solution (unless you‚Äôre willing to wait around in a Bolshevist state for 80 years hoping for the fall). Separation could be your answer. Partition and start over. Ban the left, purge them from power, kick them out of your country, and restart everything from the ground up. We can make fundamental reforms such as in the education system to prevent this from ever happening again.

                            Yes, what the right lacks is another manifesto. Put yours up Creek, I already put mine up. I‚Äôll be more sensible than you were in my critique, and far more polite.&gt;&gt;My first objection to the Creek manifesto is: there are no MEANS to do accomplish the ENDS. You are proposing we have common ends. There are no means. I propose that people get the simple means for local, never online groups of men to accomplish anything, leave the Ends vague or unstated. And leave it there. What your phantom menace is only interested in is WAYS, if those WAYS are illegal.

                            The three main spokes of our modern tyranny are mass democracy, mass education, and mass media.  Of these, the media is the one responsible for coordinating the marching moron army.  Discrediting or silencing it would certainly be a great victory and unlike political restructuring and changes to the educational system, would be achievable on a short time scale.Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfake news‚Äù meme certainly helped get the ball rolling and is probably why the media felt the need to milk Corona virus so much.  They needed to get credibility back and when they saw the people falling for Beer Flu hysteria decided to pile on with Floydmania and the resulting orgy of arson and violence.  They‚Äôve overplayed their hand with both though.  The Beer Flu hoax will collapse soon and if we can also discredit the Floyd narrative they will be done.Into the narrative vacuum we can perhaps insert our partition plan if we are smart and strike before some new ‚Äúreformed‚Äù media can be rebuilt with the same oligarchs pulling the strings.

        ‚ÄúOnce one accepts that beliefs are shaped by conditions‚ÄùMarxists also believe that he who has the power makes the conditions; revolutionary violence is part of their doctrine. Perhaps flawed, but effective nonetheless. They now control all institutions, setting all the cultural conditions, because they have all the power ‚Äî because respectable conservative normies did nothing to oppose them. Their weak ideology promoted ‚Äúnonaggression principles‚Äù and ‚Äúmagic dirt‚Äù and ‚Äúconstitution worship‚Äù (how is this any different from worshiping Marx‚Äôs books?) and the like. Marxists do not believe in fair play.‚ÄúThe Marxist defined ideology as a set of beliefs that were assumed to be true, but were, in fact, the product of economic and social conditions of the time.‚ÄùAnother similarity between Bolshevism and modern National Review conservatism: change the conditions and suddenly the old doctrine no longer applies. That‚Äôs what happens to beliefs wedded to their time and not to an understanding of the fundamental human condition.Conservative normies are wondering why the left is tearing down those statues and passing racist laws against whites. How? MLK jr. they sputter.I don‚Äôt see color. Leave the plantation. Black lives matter. Rename those bases! Tear down those flags!Because the other sides does see color. They always have; examine their rhetoric over the last 40 years. Because they are happy on the plantation; they get free stuff and permission from the establishment to indulge their racism against you. Because only their lives matter ‚Äî more than yours anyway. Paper ideologies don‚Äôt matter to them, only self interest ‚Äî theirs.The analogy isn‚Äôt perfect. Bolshevism inspires a revolutionary spirit, a type of religious fervor, which compels adherents to aggression and sacrifice for the cause. It‚Äôs very effective over the long term. Mostly secular Rome fell to Christianity (fewreallybelieved in paganism); the weak religions of the near east fell to the warrior religion of Islam; conservative Russia fell before the Bolshevik onslaught; Wiemar German fell before the aggressive doctrine of National Socialism. Moral of the story: the weak fall before the strong because nature abhors a vacuum. The same fate awaits loser National Review conservatism because they are weak, their principles a farce. They‚Äôll surrender to their superiors at the first sign of trouble, so BLM Marxism will win in the end. Dark times ahead. America may end up resembling the worst elements of Brazil, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and the Soviet Union.

        These an-caps are doing community perfectly wrong. Typical of modern ‚Äúconservatism‚Äù that they think this sort of effort is somehow a ‚Äúrefounding‚Äù on ‚Äútime-honored principles.‚ÄùZoning was not a scheme cooked up by ‚Äústatists‚Äù to impose tyranny on muh freedoms. It‚Äôs been hijacked and repurposed for all sorts of (((tricks))) but it‚Äôs hardly ‚Äúconservative‚Äù to throw the baby out with the bathwater, much less realistic or pro-social.Forming a community with anti-social individualists is by definition impossible ‚Äì not even worth trying.These guys aren‚Äôt even being Trad about it. The settler fort-towns that first formed in the Ohio Territory, for instance, weren‚Äôt governed by airy-fairy Declarations that gassed on about sacred Truth and Muh RIghts of Man.Every settler knew what the necessities of life were, who was in charge, and understood that decisions were made on the basis of necessity and the good of the community.Anyone telling Boone and his compatriots that muh Constitution forbade them this and demanded that would have been sent packing to wander through hostile territory back to Constitution-land if they could keep their scalps on long enough.We should heed that example for our communities. The time for ideological self-gratification is over. Conservatives are 10 years behind on that as usual.

            The biggest problem is actually liking the community you‚Äôre in, even if it‚Äôs white.  Having multiple white ethnicities in such a large country as ours is a huge problem.  Even the Subaru driving whites with coexist stickers in my neighborhood have their own dying, masochistic, sad ethnicity.  The first step in being in a community is being around people like me.  Should Louisiana be in the same country as Vermont?  Should Alabama be in the same country as Washington State?

                American White identity is complicated by our ethnic tribes but keep in mind that they all functioned pretty well together as late as the mid-1960‚Äôs.  We were much more unified than White Europe is today.
Functional unity requires some separation, as counter-intuitive as that sounds.  It‚Äôs why Machiavelli advised princes to allow their subordinates their ‚Äúliberties.‚Äù  Rulers shouldn‚Äôt grip the reins of the reigned so tightly.
Racial diversity is still the main culprit but the enforced mono-culture is also a driver of White American disunity and friction and it attacks intra-racial harmony more directly.

                    ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the enforced mono-culture‚Ä¶‚Äù
No one likes being ruled by foreigners. The degree of resentment is proportional to the degree of otherness. We of the various American (white) nations used to be allowed to live substantially within our own cultures. The corporate centralization of manufacture of cultural products, highly disproportionately by (((those who we are not allowed to notice))), has force fed us all a cultural diet with which most everyone is unhappy. Even if the mono-culture were quality we would resent it, because it isn‚Äôt OURS. However, it is shit.

        There is nothing wrong at all with old world conservatism. People (including lefties of the day) lived by it, it‚Äôs principles and did well for themselves and their people because it worked.The reason it doesn‚Äôt work today has nothing to do with it‚Äôs moral and ethic elements; it doesn‚Äôt work today because a succession of cucks, neocons, sellouts, RINOs and other cretins have undermined the old values.There is so a separation of right and left; but what‚Äôs happened is the left has gone mad, and the right is beginning to teeter. I attribute this to the proliferation of women and vibrants in the political process. The left went all in on diversity and inclusion and now they are 100% gone off the deep end. Conservatism originally resisted the pozz‚Ä¶ but we are slowly succumbing to it too. In addition our vibrants and women tend to be of much better quality than those coming from the left‚Ä¶ but it won‚Äôt be enough to stave off what‚Äôs coming.Until we get our vibrants, women, and degenerates back under control‚Ä¶ we are headed in the same direction Leftie has gone.

        Official Bologna Tester: ‚ÄúMy father was from England. And my mother was from Germany. I‚Äôm an Anglo Saxon Saxon. Top that.‚Äù  I always think of you as a little Italian kid in Italy who hangs out in your grandparents spiced meats deli, and is always sneaking bites of the meats.  So grandparents playfully gave you the title  Official Bologna Tester.

        ENDS, MEANS,¬†AND WAYS.Ends are goals, means are the ability to do anything at all, ways are methods.There are no means on the right.I‚Äôll propose that people get the simple means for local, never online groups of men to accomplish anything, leave the Ends vague or unstated.And leave it there.¬†A few local pals is enough or survival of most here.I‚Äôm a vet and I know what‚Äôs coming [my only ever Federal status being Title 10 orders¬†from time to time].What the phantom menace is only interested in is WAYS, if those WAYS are¬†illegal.¬†Don‚Äôt give them that,¬†nor even mention it.Ends are goals, means are the ability to do anything at all, ways are methods.Just get some means,¬†ends are best left unstated, avoid even speaking of ways.The largely phantom federal menace is only interested in illegal WAYS, meaning illegal actions.¬†Don‚Äôt even discuss such things and you‚Äôll be fine.Happy Independence day.

        1976 was such a great year to be a kid. The city allowed people to paint all the fire hydrants red white and blue.  Or maybe the city did it themselves.   Neil Diamond‚Äôs ‚ÄúSweet Caroline‚Äù came out in ‚Äô69, but I remember it from ‚Äô76.  Such an American song.

        This man Trump is a builder and a businessman.  He didn‚Äôt protect the statues we had, but he certainly is willing to build us a big beautiful park of replacements.  Or at least sign an EO directing it.
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-he-plans-to-sign-order-establishing-national-garden-of-american-heroes
We‚Äôre at this man‚Äôs limits, that‚Äôs all.  He never promised anything but peace and prosperity ‚Äì and for a long period he delivered.But then both were taken away, and he‚Äôs at his limits.  He will not harm us ‚Äì unlike his opponents ‚Äì but he cannot protect us either.

                The link I‚Äôm looking at has Stone mountain and a Giant Confederate middle finger on it, as well as several links that could decidedly be construed as racist.Also ‚Äì they‚Äôre admitting we‚Äôre basically in low level Civil War, and have most definite ideas beyond being reasonable, having a cup of coffee, and fantasies about Galt‚Äôs Gulch and ‚Äúgetting away‚Äù in terms of self defense, etc.Mind you, they‚Äôre probably not as racist as here.  They‚Äôre also not whining about whether their wives will approve.Nor do they seem to be focused on shitting on others as not pure enough white, etc.So while they may be imperfect, they have a better plan than whining, fantasizing about pure ethnic villages somewhere that will somehow magically be left alone, and undermining other peoples work.And they seem to have been deplatformed on WordPress for a very short time before coming up elsewhere.We‚Äôre on WordPress right now, BTW.  Makes you wonder, eh detractors?

        Leaving aside the legitimate need for Emminent Domain, even though it may be used in questionable ways, it‚Äôs a valid question of debate: How and in what manners should a government restrict the uses of private property? Cherished ideal it may be, but when one weights the consequences of a free-for-all, most people say, ‚ÄúYes, we do want some limitations on what gets built where.‚Äù Long-gone, probably before most people here were born, were the racially and similar restrictive covenants to keep Undesirables out of the neighborhood. As Z‚Äôs essay notes, virtually all areas that lost that protection, 1948 onward, turned into shitholes in just a few years.Fortuantely zoning still exists, for the most part. Most of it is by wealth these days. As I cynically note, in nicer communities, any poor black or brown people have the same legal rights to purchase a ten million dollar home, or to rent it (probably at what, $10,000/month). So far, being poor hasn‚Äôt been made a ‚Äúprotected class‚Äù under the Civil Rights Act. But people are trying other methods‚Ä¶In most places, the zoning is a local power. But some States are trying to override this and have in some cases.Here is one of my better sarcasm pieces, called ‚ÄúUpzoning for Conservatives.‚Äù Fits in well with today‚Äôs topic.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xmHPcwhpV3xpqpDVYwat_ftsYenG_Ghi1ySBx1Fr-Y0/edit?usp=sharing

                That I‚Äôm sure is a Hoot, but its a Holler to read the normalcy bias present  in American life concerning Law, laws, zoning regs, et al.  ( excluding you Falcone, and others).That is all vanishing before our eyes.  For example without police the law has no enforcement.Perhaps it all does come down to property as noted above, in the sense that the Jews who stuck around Germany after 1933 did so because they didn‚Äôt want to pay confiscatory fines to leave‚Ä¶. of course the other side is we whites in 2020 America have no place to go.There‚Äôs that too.

                    I was always struck by the value of a deed in that whole Jew / Germany thing.  A simple deed, or a recording instrument indicating ownership of property, held a lot of power in the years well after WWII.   If a Jew could produce a deed showing they were the legal former owners of a property but had been kicked out b/c of Hitler, they could use that deed to reclaim it.But this also presumes two parties acting in good faith.  I wonder if the deed to my property will mean anything after the purge.  Actually I don‚Äôt wonder.  I know it won‚Äôt.

        These ideologies are intellectually exhausted, they need to be financially exhausted.Something happened around the time of the protestant reformation. People got it in their heads that their ideas and input matters. It was most obvious with Luther himself which gave it a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart, but probably the atmosphere had been brewing in some way prior anyway. Ideology is now the water we swim in and thanks to technology you almost cant avoid it ever. How do we move past it? Just find some way to put most people back in their place and completely scrub ideas like egalitarianism out of our collective consciousness? That wont happen so coping with it is pretty daunting.

            Just find some way to put most people back in their place and completely scrub ideas like egalitarianism out of our collective consciousness? That wont happen so coping with it is pretty daunting.Ultimately it‚Äôs what needs to happen though. If the modern world is to survive and go on to build that glorious future we‚Äôve all seen in sci-fi, the egalitarian ideological age (which I would date from about 1750-present) must end.Egalitarianism is the meta-religion of the modern world. It‚Äôs why, 31 years after the fall of the Soviet Union we are fighting Leftist uprisings in major American cities and our elites are talking about restructuring our society until we ‚Äúeliminate systemic racism‚Äù ‚Äì another open ended utopian project guaranteed to cause misery and death in direct proportion to how seriously it is taken.I remember all the smug back-slapping by conservatives in the early 90s. There were popular books like Fukuyama‚ÄôsThe End of Historythat celebrated a new golden age of free markets with nations and ideologies all dissolved in capitalist prosperity. People thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs finally over!‚Äù.It wasn‚Äôt over. ‚ÄúIt‚Äù just re-invented itself again. In hindsight we* should have seen it coming. The new flag wasn‚Äôt the tired old red banner with hammer and sickle, it was rainbow hued and the symbol on top was the ‚ôÄ(female symbol if your browser doesn‚Äôt show it). So it wasn‚Äôt that sexual degenerates couldn‚Äôt function because their sexuality was the tip of an iceberg of mental illness that affected everything, it wasn‚Äôt that women and PoC couldn‚Äôt function because they were outside of their performance envelope, it was all patriarchal heterosexism and ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù.The meta-religion‚Äôs 2 basic premises are that any inequality in whatever parameter is regarded as most important is not caused by innate differences but by some vast conspiracy that pervades everything and therefore effort must be made to aggressively root it out from everything. The other premise is that this effort is both desirable and that it can succeed. Neither premise is true and so the modern world staggers from one catastrophe to another. When one cycle of madness burns itself out, the meta-religion invents a new one. Meanwhile, the ultimate irony and tragedy is that scientific progress, the only real example of progress we know, keeps handing ever more powerful weapons to the lunatics to use against the rest of us.This cycle MUST be broken. There‚Äôs a war afoot and not just the American CWII. The egalitarians are using modern communications and mass media to make a play forglobaldominance now. I talked about this yesterday here in the context of the billionaires‚Äô shadow world government and the need to oppose it worldwide as well. The Church of Equality will ultimately win everywhere or be routed everywhere. Due to the continued dominance of the US, the fate of the world hinges on which way the American domino falls.*we: (naive conservatives and libertarians) I‚Äôd say I was one of these at the time.

        Zoning laws are not some locally tailored rules that the residents in our communities pulled together for our benefit. They are as corrupt as any of our other government functions. I believe there are some groups that put out ‚Äúmodel‚Äù zoning codes that most localities adopt (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). Sure they may require mom &amp; pop operations to adhere to certain rules but those rules get a lot more flexible when a box store wants to build.About 20 years ago I watched the owner of a local KFC basically beg the zoning board to let him have a drive-up window when he had to rebuild his building. His franchise agreement required it and if the zoning board denied his request he was out of business. You can claim that these officials were looking out for our community but they seemed like affluent snobs who had to be appeased.By the way, not only will zoning laws not only fail to keep out any of the box stores do you really think they will keep out the section 8 housing? So much for the community.

            I‚Äôm not really interested in chasing that stick. I would never argue that zoning laws are ideal or that they are immune to corruption. Only cranks from libertarianism think in such ways. For now, they simply serve to protect white communities from the predation of developers hoping to cash in on the Left‚Äôs war on whites.

The Ur Dog of Jack Russel‚Äôs eponymous¬†breed, back in 1819 was called Trump.
And, as we are finding out. It was a bitch.

I was kinda wondering how many generations it took to breed out a seperate type of dog with desired attributes- loyalty, speed, size, strength,aggression, tenacity, intelligence etc. Anecdotally about ten seems to do it. imagine what you can do in the 2,000 generations since homo sapiens left Africa.

            FEDThe site he links to (westernrifleshooters) has a pic of a child smiling as a home burns in the background: ‚ÄúIs it wrong to follow rioters home and burn down their property? Asking for a friend.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs a spicy comment on that thread that I suspect came from agent Mulder here: ‚ÄúProTip, glove up, before pitching gas bombs. I‚Äôve had success at lifting finger prints off of the shattered burnt glass.‚Äù   ‚Ä¶. yeah. Don‚Äôt do that, I mean listen to these people.‚ÄúRoad Flares are cheap, by the case, burn at roughly 1800 degrees, and once burning rarely go out until burned out.‚ÄùThey are also tracked by the government. Yeah, go out and buy (or steal) stuff that will leave a record. Plus, terrorism. Am I the only one here who thinks this guy is a plant?FED

                Dear Creek,I realize its the weekend, but lay off the weed.  Paranoia is destructive.Trump is President and has a perfect right indeed duty to respond with insurrection by force.   Actually his sworn duty and he‚Äôs not alone.As far as WRSA people posted it was down, I posted it was back up.  That led to accusations of WRSA being CivNats, responded to with some links showing just how civil they are.   Not very, but at least they show some courage.  An accusation I‚Äôm sure will never be leveled against you.  Now you‚Äôre a coward and proud of it, I‚Äôm sure you think that‚Äôs the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù play for ‚Äúour people‚Äù.However among the flaws in your analysis are;* That I am suggesting anything illegal, No, and the implications drawn by someone on a paranoid bender don‚Äôt hold any weight.*worse ‚Äì that we don‚Äôt need to do anything but be passive while the enemy destroys themselves.  The enemy is not destroying themselves, they‚Äôre destroying us ‚Äì and the pace of their operations is quickening.  Passivity is what got us clown world, and now its getting us Pennywise‚Äôs fun house.* You may inform your PO however or whoever you‚Äôre afraid of taking your candy away that the most radical thing I would do is restore actual Constitutional Govt, if possible.  Something I‚Äôm sure THEY are aware I‚Äôm sworn to do ‚Äì if possible.Meanwhile I shall try to inform the troubled suburbanites that they‚Äôd better get ready, its America‚Äôs turn at the wheel.And no this problem doesn‚Äôt fix itself, they never do.  Someone else does. Normally one can ignore it, not if you live in that country however.We get this, or it gets us.However at least have the courage of your convictions and take your own advice Nancy Drew (the FED finder) and say nothing.  Speech is violence you know.  STFU if you‚Äôre so nervous, they can read all this you know.BITCH.Go snivel to your PO if you don‚Äôt like it,Cheers!

            Haven‚Äôt looked at this for a while but it seemed to me that 401k‚Äôs (and we are talking about those now held outside the company) were more restricted than IRA‚Äôs in terms of assets they could hold. So a conversion may be advisable. IRA‚Äôs can hold Real Estate, investments in private (none publicly traded) companies and physical metals. Real estate values will likely plummet if the real worse case happens but seems to me to be the least easily looted. Thirty years ago there was increasing reluctance for some  foreign banks to deal with US nationals- too much hassle,Be wary. Share what you findGood luck

                Recently I opened an interactive broker IRA account.  I transferred 2/3rds of a vanguard traditional IRA to the IB IRA.
The firm I‚Äôm working with now seems to be able to purchase just about anything from within the IB account.
I have domestic and foreign individual stocks,  a bunch of different currencies‚Ä¶I‚Äôm impressed.

            Thanks for the replies ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a good point that a company 401k may have restrictions on the type of assets that it can be rolled-over into.  Any that I find out that may be useful, I‚Äôll share in this comment section.

            It was suggested, by a rather young person, to just get an account in Switzerland.  They had seen a documentary about corrupt Korean officials that had done this and when the SHTF, the details of their accounts were not available to investigators since the accounts were in a different country, etc.Haven‚Äôt checked it out but it may offer one degree of separation from the US gubment ‚Äúwealth spreaders‚Äù.
