        They’re not lying to be believed, in fact they want you to know they’re lying. This is a demonstration of raw power to show who is the master and who is the slave. Dominance and submission, a playbook as old as mankind.

            And in this kind of political struggle, symbolism is everything. It’s why politics will always be downstream from culture. Culture is a raw commodity that can be the most potent weapon in a politician’s arsenal. It is the kinetic energy of politics. Too bad the Stupid Party can’t figure this out.

                The Stupid Party is (or was, until it imploded) perfectly fine with thestatus quo.

                    Assuming we mean the same stupid party here, they are dominated by the desire for money above all else .That desire was so overwhelming  that they allowed the US to be destroyed.In fact they preferred to turn the US into Brazil meets Cuba rather than allow wages to go up and people to have better lives. The  burned the US down  to avoid the one  wage, 30 hour work week America the 60’s assumed would happen.The Left now temporary allies will turn on them in time but it will be far too late by than.Until the DR realizes that the overly monied  are as big an issue  as the actual oligarchs  as well  that the the social fabric is more important than the rich, it will struggle.The working class we need, the middle class we need , the lower end of the upper  deserve wealth. The rest are a menace. This sounds much like the old non Commie Left and the Populist Right believed but both were correct.A stable social fabric with high homogeneity and a balanced economy leads to a good society, if said society puts a boot on the necks of the mutants who destabilize the social fabric.

            I’m not so sure about that. I interface with lots of these people and the the phrase “true believer” always comes to mind. The mistake we always make is to assume the other side shares our motivations.

                No doubt. I’ve worked at all levels of government and it is well stocked with useful idiots. Those who rise to the top however are anything but, and I have no illusions they share my motivations. There is a particular type of human who wants to dominate everything (literally) and they frequently manage to assume power over the true believers, and we know how that ends.

                Another mistake we make is sending out mixed signals. While it’s true that big tech companies need reined in by the government, we make it hard to do this when we continue to do business with them. We literally pay for the lobbyists they hire to suppress us. Boycotting them is a necessary precursor to returning them, yet few event try to make that measly sacrifice.

                    Not having Netflix is too much to ask for most dissidents.One dissident I used to follow got all butthurt because he got stuck in Disney World in Paris when the lockdowns first started.He had his single digit aged daughter in friggin Disney!  This guy would do youtube videos on how Disney is pumping evil into children’s heads.  He knows Disney is evil. Yet he cannot keep his daughter away from it.  Perhaps he was just a shill, but then why do videos about how he and his daughter were stuck in Disney and advertise it?We’re always saying good times create weak men. This was a perfect example of a man so weak he could not stay away from Disney or Netflix.

                        To be honest, I’m not sure if it’s weakness, a lack of self-awareness, or just a surplus of stupidity that explains that behavior. Given what happened last Wednesday, I’m leaning towards stupidity. It’s like they have no mental to connect downstream consequences to present decisions.

                Almost every white liberal that I meet truly believes everything that’s been thrown out over the past four years. Russia, Trump is Hitler, BLM, you name it.It’s hard to discern their motivations. It’s not fear of getting in trouble because they obviously believe the party line. They definitely hate rural (and, especially, Southern) whites, which is interesting because some of them are from the Midwest or South.I get the animosity of a certain tribe. They’re brought up on stories of how they narrowly escaped being wiped out by Badwhites. But the hatred – not dislike but hatred – of Goodwhites toward their own kin is a bit of a mystery to me.

                    History is full of instances where elites massacred and sold out (in some cases literally) their own people for personal gain. There was just a brief period where that was discouraged but that discouragement was not due to brotherhood but the progressives wanting to seek power. First they undermined the old order by promising egalitarianism and then when they got power, erected their own form of elitism we see today. Poor and working class whites benefited from that brief stretch of egalitarianism but it was never meant to be.The middle class is a historical aberration and we are regressing to the mean. The only difference is who rules us but the disdain and sometimes hatred of the peasantry is different. Thanks to Marxism, there is a philosophical framework that has provided the legitimacy of the disenfranchisement of hundreds of millions of people. I know it’s a well worn talking point of saying state is the new religion but it is particularly applicable here.

Basically one generation hung onto it and that is despite the massive selling off of all that wealth.While the underclass never really truly went away, it was very small. But it has been steadily growing since the end of the 70s. It has been accelerating since the 90s.All those white men dying of opiate overdoses are the sons of factory workers getting paid good money and a good pension. All those starving cat women working at Buzzfeed and the like and “sex workers” are the daughters or grandaughters of the housewives those men should have had.The “elite” have overseen the dismantling of the wealthiest and happiest society that has ever been. There is no fate bad enough for them.

                            A great trick was fooling those cat ladies into thinking that lifestyle was “empowerment” when in reality it’s just a decline in living standards back to serfdom and poverty. Same thing with the bugman urban millenial – he think he’s living a cool and hip lifestyle but he’s actually a disposable wage slave.
The non-urban lower class white men didn’t even get fooled I guess they just decided to die off.
To be fair such a society could never be maintained with modern morals anyways, the levels of degeneracy and wealthy since the 1960s have always pointed to a decline.

                            Tars: “The “elite” have overseen the dismantling of the wealthiest and happiest society that has ever been.”Very true.  What too many (on both sides) often forget is that half of all White people have IQs below 100.  These are not bad or evil or even exceptionally stupid people, but not everyone is born to be in damned STEM.  A solid, functioning culture needs its truck drivers and factory workers who can earn a solid wage and raise a family from honest work.  The jobs were deliberately exported and now men have no work and no family.  A society of alien bugmen is no nation at all, merely a particular economic zone.  Which, of course, is what they want, a world of varying economic zones all inhabited by the same mix of mystery meat, with a handful of leashed Whites to keep the lights on for the Davos/Bilderberg crowd.

                                Couldn’t agree more. That was my point.  It is largely not the sons of the STEM workers killing themselves with dope. It is the sons of factory workers and other union men and men who worked hard.It’s not really even intelligence. A machinist, for example, generally does not need a college education, but you are just not going to meet a sub 95 IQ machinist.We have far too much “education” in America.  It starts in Jr high school and just gets worse as you go forward.  There are high schools in America where not a single “teen” can read, write or compute at grade level. None of these schools are in “rural” America.

                                Yep, why my own CivNat response to the world around us was to work with what you have and build an economy around it.  We have lots of people of all races who simply don’t have what it takes to be in STEM or finance.  So we need manufacturing and blue collar jobs.  It’s our civic duty to create an economy that works for all.

                                Tractors destroyed more honest work than foreign trade did. While resenting foreigners is great fun, it’s good to remember that the Western war on menial jobs was a pincer attack, and one of the pincers is technology.

                                    I don’t resent foreigners because it’s ‘great fun,’ but because they’re invading and colonizing my country.  If you’re going to resent tractors you might as well resent the automobile because buggy whip makers lost their jobs.  Anti-tech can, like anything else, be taken too far.  There are still plenty of factory jobs in the world that will never entirely go away, they’ve just been offshored.

                                Agree, except in motives. Of course humans are capable of great, deliberate evils. But I think, like the old expression, that much of what we think is malice is just stupidity, or even just innocent or even well-intentioned activity without regard for consequences. E.g. it wasn’t some evil Jewish/Communist plot to marginalize rural Whites by making them unemployed, it was driven by a capitalist desire for profits by minimizing costs (again, short term goals over long term costs.) A comparable, indeed worse in many ways, problem is that posed by our extant Negro population. Yes, they are a problem, but who brought them here? For what reasons?

                        True. In my reading of feudal Europe, what struck me the most was how deeply the nobility despised their own people.
It does feel like we’re moving back to a feudal order where the elites control all of the wealth generating assets and the poor are basically slaves.

                    &gt; It’s hard to discern their motivations. It’s not fear of getting in trouble because they obviously believe the party line. They definitely hate rural (and, especially, Southern) whites, which is interesting because some of them are from the Midwest or South.For a large portion of progressives, they believe what makes them feel powerful.  They see in rural whites the sports jock who got all the girls, while nobody understood their moral and intellectual superiority.  As our social structures break down and traitors are rewarded with social media accolades as opposed to rope, this is going to do nothing but accelerate.

                    It’s status signaling. Nothing deeper than that. I’m surrounded by these chowder heads and NPR is their Oracle. At least the older ones. The younger have been assaulted on all sides from birth and the ones with idiot or absentee parents get absorbed into the cult. One can read about the creatures telling the Big Lies in the Gospel of John.

                    If it helps, good whites aren’t actually kin to bad whites. There is real ethnic diversity among the melanin-challenged, so it’s a bit thick to believe that skin color alone is sufficient to inspire group loyalty in this instance. I recommend a book called the American nations for a more detailed analysis of the history of puritanical hatred of Southerners. The TL;DR is that it’s an extension of British class/ethnic strife from the 16th and 17th centuries.

                        if a white nationalistic movement were to emerge it would be sabotaged from the inside by other whites, mainly CHRISTIANS, who will attack other whites for being immoral(which means cucks).bad whites have always been plagued by the idea of fairness and morality, same shit can be seen in republicans, this is beyond politics, it’s the legacy of christianity on the white religious mind.Cleansing areas of blacks will be seen as evil, many whites will turn on each other if this were to happen.

                            “if”
There’s the rub, isn’t it? It’s not Christianity that precluded white nationalism, it’s the fact that there is no “white” nation. The melanin-impaired in France don’t identify as white, or even European, they identify as French. Even in America, non-legacy whites identify themselves by their ancestral ethnicity (Irish, Italian, German, etc.) My ancestors fought the British in revolutionary war, and I still identify myself by my mixed ancestral ethnicity. The white identity doesn’t exist because there’s nothing to it beyond melanin content.

                                makes me wonder if the aim of America with its “everyone is welcome” wasn’t some way to encourage mixing among the white tribes so they lose their sense of themselves and their real heritage, making them easier to manipulate.

                                    Maybe. The catholic church has laws against consanguineous marriage, which helped eliminate small-scale intertribal conflict in Europe. Scaling away from tribalism seems to make cooperation more feasible on a large level, but as (((some))) have shown in recent times, the non-tribalistic can be dominated by the intensely tribalistic. I don’t know if I’d want constant tribal warfare like Africa, though, some I’m not sure if it’s best to encourage or discourage mixing.

                                White identity may not be a powerful reality, but the white race most assuredly exists. Russians and Portuguese, Icelanders and Bulgarians, share far more genetic material than they do with Asians, let alone sub-Saharan Africans. And the four nationalities I mentioned will be far more comfortable with one another than with anybody else because they share this little thing called Western civilization.

                            At least we’ve reached the point where whites have some idea about what they want, though they’re still obstinate about what it would take to get there.  The thought of automatically siding with some white person who is a stranger over a black guy who they might know, for instance, is completely foreign.

                                The thought of automatically siding with some white person who is a stranger over a black guy who they might know, for instance, is completely foreign.imagine if the black person starts crying and begging, I can’t imagine the cuckery that will unfold.

                        Yes, the study of the English civil war really opened my eyes to the history of conflict that came here pre made before the ships landed. The settlers in the North and in the South were from the beginning of different cultures.

                    But the hatred – not dislike but hatred – of Goodwhites toward their own kin is a bit of a mystery to me.One of the most profound things Tucker Carlson has ever said was some unbridledRealTalkthat he truth bombed last week. Watch from7:00 to about 9:00and you will get your answer.Many of them see shades of their roots in these people and where they ‘escaped’ from to get to Cloud City. The sheer thought of their prole upbringing fills them with utter hatred.It is also why they scream the loudest about RAYCISS! because those people have the financial means to keep diversity FAR away from themselves &amp; their children. It fills them with intense guilt and anxiety which they then project onto everyone else who donothave the means to escape the bioweapon they want to deploy on everyone else.

                        There maybe be some truth to that. Are “nouveau riche” UMC and Upper Class whites a) more liberal and b) more likely to have actual poverty/trashy roots?I don’t see much hatred towards dirt people from wealthier white conservatives (people, not the idiots in the republican party). It’s more indifference. We are two separate groups.FWIW almost all the wealthier conservatives I know, their ancestors were doing fine back in the agrarian days too – either small farm owner or farm equipment mechanic etc. Over time the more intelligent moved to cities to do other work. Alot of liberals had ancestors doing shitty work as factory slaves etc.

                        The most annoying shitlib I know grew up in Alabama 70+ years ago and I suspect the family had a black mammy. Now she’s in constant signaling overdrive mode trying to wash clean her imaginary sins. The problem with these people in a nutshell is they have no standards. They just glide down the progressive river gathering up whatever flotsam and jetsam gets pushed out by the “enlightened” and incorporate it in to their incoherent world view.

                    I see the hatred as social climbers hating and being ashamed of their rootsThe logical conclusion is that ambition and careerism selects for the type of people who would throw their own families under the bus to get ahead.The model is broken.  Scouring the land for high SAT-scorers from the middle class and elevating them into prestigious universities and so forth has given us this hell.  I’ll say what I believe knowing it may not be that popular, but if you don’t come from money and power you shouldn’t be given it or ever trusted with it.  Yes, lots of rich people are garbage, but that can be said for every social class, but they are simply better equipped to run things — for better or for worse.   People say “Trump took on the world and no one ever had to deal with the stuff he has.”  In a word, that’s a crock.  That’s only true if you lower your standards for what a great man is.  Plenty of great men have faced FAR FAR worse and came out on top.  That’s why they’re great and Trump, although I like him, was not and never will be.

                        I get your point here, but wonder how did those who are from “old” money get there in the first place and how do we replace those who drop out of that class, i.e., the end of such dynasties.
Seems to me some societal mobility is a good thing.

                        Yes, this is covered in Charles MurrayComing Apartand no doubt other works. There has always (well, modern times) been a premium on high intelligence; it accelearted in the USA in the mid-20th century and is  a dominant sorting mechanism today. Of course, it (inadvertently) sorts by race etc. since dim bulbs are more prevalent in some races than others.This has its downsides, not hte least of which is the intelligent are more apt to be removed from Spittoon County, where they might once have been locally successful. Instead, they are a mid-level grunt in a cubicle in a big city two thousand miles distant.

                You’re both right: “To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies.”
–Orwell on doublethink.
(And for those people who complain that Orwell is quoted too much: nope, not having it. He was one of the greatest political psychologists of all time, and his truths, like those of any great thinker-writer, bear repeating.)

                Oh, they really believe all right, to the bottom of their souls. Just to take a minor (in the grand scheme of things) example, the people I stay in touch with in academia are, to a persyn, convinced that COVID has killed millions, and that there are bodies rotting in the streets. Nothing, absolutely nothing, can convince them otherwise. They make the Q-tards look sane and reasonable. They remind me of nothing more than prisoners being led to the back room in the Lubyanka, yelling “wait until Comrade Stalin hears about this!”

                    A family member broke down and cried out of concern that I was going to die from COVID because I don’t follow lockdown rules. He is also destroying his mental health, and social life, by becoming a hermit to “fight COVID” – The virus has affected his health and life overall alot more than mine.
The same person also said that Trump was “about equal to Hitler” which is quite a mind boggling claim… No these people don’t even deserve the right to vote.

I love pointing out to all the people in my mask-happy family that I, who refuse to wear the fucking thing and will urge retailers to throw me out and / or call the cops if they insist, am the only one who has been perfectly healthy all year. Not even a fucking sniffle. They, meanwhile, have had all sorts of problems, which of course send them into a tizzy every time. Is it COVID, ohmigod! No, darling, it’s just that you’re fucking up your own immune response by carrying around a germ-laden muzzle under your nose all the goddamn time.

                            Well, I guess it’s confession time.
Shortly after Christmas, wife and I caught Covid.  We don’t do masks and it looks like one of our friends got infected.  That’s life.
Wife had a runny nostril, I had a very slight cold.  Kind of glad now.  I freely admit to inculcating the 24/7 non-stop fear of agonizing death from this “scourge”—albeit I did not know how much until I got diagnosed.
Folks, covid is not the end.  Keep yourself strong and healthy—mentally and physically.  You’ll do just fine.

                            None of us have been sick, although younger son is forced to wear a mask at work.  I always go on a cleaning binge after putting away the Christmas decorations, however, and I’m stirring up a ton of dust, which makes me sneeze repeatedly.  If I do so in public, people are literally terrified and shy away.

                Unfortunately Z, you are correct with the “true believer” description. My friend Henry retired from his PD job around twelve years ago after 25 years and walked away without a scratch. Five years ago he contracted MS and is now confined to a wheel chair. He has two daughters who he busted his ass for in terms of putting away money for their future and because of government school indoctrination, they now view him as the anti-Christ. I’ve witnessed both of them laying into him and the only thing missing is the frothing at the mouth.There is a maniacal gleam in their eyes while they do this and on a certain level, it is truly frightening. I spoke to him last week and he told me that he’s done. The wife won’t come to his defense because “They’re our daughters, what are we going to do?” “Bro.” he said, “If any of the scumbags you see on TV, or the web told them that they should turn in their parents, saying that the Utopia they want won’t be possible without it, they’d have that number on speed dial and they’d cheer as I was carted away.” he told me he will be moving in with his brother down in SC sometime this year and he will be selling his house and he’s going to tell the three of them that they’re on their own. I know it breaks his heart, I can hear it in his voice and I can recall a time when I would visit his home and his girls were very polite and well adjusted. He told me that there are two “teachers” in the local school to thank for it all and thanks to union rules, they can’t be fired.One thing he did mention to me was that if by some miracle he is still around after this is all over with, he says the worst punishment should be reserved for people like the two “teachers”. People who poison children against their parents/families and the country. That punishment should be long, slow and painful.

                    Steve:  Truly sorry to read about your friend’s plight, but (even though this will be unpopular) he has to accept some blame for this.  He didn’t teach his wife who was head of the family.  He didn’t check what his girls were being taught, or teach them not to believe all that was pushed in school.  I hope he does cut them all off – make certain his will is ironclad or everything he worked for will go to everyone that wants him dead.

                        You are correct. When he first told me of this, he said that he and his wife asked for a meeting with the teachers and complained, they did everything but laugh at them and I explained to him that he went about this all wrong.I told him that he should have spoken with the other parents of the kids that were in the class and then reached out to all of them in order to show up as a block. I told him that the two of you are easily dismissed, now if say almost a hundred pissed off parents show up at the school to complain, now that they can’t dismiss out of hand.As for prepping them for what they might encounter in the govt school, I’m not sure what he did, or didn’t do. I have asked him and he’s told me that he never went to college and that he used material from when he was in grade school back in the 70’s. He thought that would be enough.As I said, I wasn’t around 24/7 and therefore cannot really ascertain everything he did to prevent this. As for cutting them off, he did tell me that he has quietly contacted another friend at a law firm that specializes in this sort of thing and that it is being taken care of. We’ll see.

                    I guess I should be thankful that both my parents were teachers  (conservative too, I mean not as ‘conservative’ as me, but then not many people are).  It meant as a kid that it was impossible to pull one over on them, but it also meant that the school was never going to pull one over on them either.

            For the first time in my life, I actually fear my own government.
Because of the candidates I’ve sent $ to, the books I’ve read, donations to authors, even the party I nominally affiliated with.  Legal activities all…but the wayback machine on life now has real world consequences that are progressively getting more and more harsh.

            Classic rock tie-in (Z should like): “Dominance and Submission” is a rockin’ early 70s ballad by Blue Oyster Cult. As far as I can tell, it’s about some teens driving down to Times Square for New Years 1964.

            Part of the problem, of course,is that what we are facing right now is Left-Wing Fascism, which is something of a new phenomenon in history. People tend to associate Fascism with physically fit marching white guys in cool uniforms, nationalism, and charismatic leaders, so when they see the crowd of autistic nebbishes, dysfunctional browns, grasping globalists, and hysterical wine aunts that are actually our ruling class, the last thing that they think of is Fascism, even though that is exactly what it is. Spandrell gets some things wrong, IMHO, but he’s absolutely right about Bioleninism – the rule of the least fit, because they are the least fit.

                    So far. They haven’t yet got the political momentum to send you to camps though deep in their hearts nearly everyone of them wants to and is working on it.It will be voluntary after a fashion. You don’t go, you can’t work, get aid or have a bank account till your social credit score is high enough,Or they may just go full Kulak on you.And not its no inevitable, the one good thing to come of that idiocy in D.C. was a visual display of the power of organization and that was just civil disobedience and nothing else.It can get a lot more effective as needed if as I’ve been saying for years, the Right learns to organize in whatever size groups.Also if anyone is thinking of going to that armed protest on the 16th I think?  Don’t. Even where legal its obviously a trap. Obvious trap is Obvious.Its one thing to go to a march when asked by your President and  for things to get a bit put of hand and quite another to go do something 100% stupid and possibly illegal for who knows. Probably the FBI or some agent provocateur or some dumb as frack hothead. DO NOT DO THAT.

                    This is, without doubt, one of the weirdest tics of “conservative” cops: their compulsion to enforce laws their religious/political beliefs would deem immoral. It’s like they can’t grasp that its not a big deal to leave evil laws unenforced.

                        Most police are selected to obey orders not think. Its virtually a hereditary caste  too (for example  TV’s Blue Bloods) much as military service is in some families.This is why a DR might consider mandatory national service for all men and if needed occupational restriction on law enforcement as needed.Its also sadly why so many difficult cases go unsolved and so many American vanish each year. Some of this  is resources but its also the LEO’s are more a peacekeeping  meets brute squad for ghettos and poor neighborhoods than detectives and community police.Under  DR regime I’d be very tempted to try some of the Leftists policing ideas actually and see if they work when combined with marriage reform.Contrary to the opinion here with strong churches and families , the jogger population is kept in check by local Blacks and community policing can work.It does require a stable economy and stable marriage though. The money boys were willing to destroy it rather than allow stable jobs and wages and nearly have and the Leftist rabble hate the later.Fix those, shoot or hang the worst, deport non assimilated  and the US will be able to function at a higher level.

                Its mostly forgotten today that Fascism was an anti-materialist philosophy.  Which does not mean that they were ascetic but that they saw an animating spirit as more important to life an history than an accumulation of property and rejected the materialist determinism of marxism.  The various flavors of fascism saw that spirit as the customs, culture and religion of their nations.Jump forward to today and the antifa fascists are also an anti-materialist movement.  Except that they see the European spirit as evil instead of inspiring.  In that way they are more of a mirror image to the fascists of a century ago than the marxist contemporaries were.

            Absolutely central to the totalitarian project is the corruption of the meaning of words.I agree with you.This is one of the most effective tools of the Progressives today. How many of us have rolled our eyes upon hearing “No, actually People of Colorcan’tberacisttowards whites, since whites have institutional power blah blah blah.”Racism is racism unless… its black on white?Labels have also become absurd and meaningless in themselves. There is no objective standard, only the trends of the day:“People of color is preferred.”“Colored People? Why you horrible racist bigot!”Another one of their tools is what I like to call “argumentum ad relativity”: everything is relative, everything is merely a social construct, nothing is sacred, there is no objective truth. When that’s the case, no change or desecration is every really a big deal, because it was only ever a social construct, and our new and progressive society is better and more politically correct anyway. Slowly we alter the definition of a word here, desecrate history there; which over time evolves into making absurd accusations and alterations to law and legislation there, tearing down a statue and setting fire to a building there….

        Since the last few years, but especially in the last 6 months, I have ceased to believe anything I’ve been taught to believe about the most significant man in (recent) history.Growing up “fascism” simply meant a kind of strong man government.
Z’s podcast on fascism, lets talk about fascism, haha, was the first time I heard any serious discussion of the subject.We’re in a pickle, most people would have no idea about the corporate aspect of fascism. I’ve talked to these people they are not interested in learning anything.

                Maybe luck, I’ve had some great Jewish friends, including one guy who had my back when nobody else would and probably saved me from ruin.
With that said, those guys would circle the wagons when zionism or related topics came up in conversation. Some self-policing would do them well.

The lack of in-group awareness from the average white gentile is what’s putting us in such a dangerous position. You can be friendly/polite with each other while being aware of the racial boundaries and agendas.

But yes when Zionism comes up they go mad.

From their POV, you have to think that here they are telling a gentile a load of b.s. but he just sits there nodding his head.  Would you respect the person?  Would you consider that person anything but a moron?  Why I think they deeply loathe evangelicals with the muh Israel stuff.  When I worked corporate among a number of them, the hatred they had for evangelicals was off the charts.

I know. They know I know. I know they know I know. The “blacker” the black, the better understanding we have. Mulattoes are nasty, and upper middle class blacks are pretty insecure too.
It’s pretty funny. We’re almost smiling.
Whites are the only group who don’t have that subconscious radar going on.

                    I have had good relationships with a few on a personal level.But money is involved here, and the moment that comes into play they change. It’s bizarre, but the person you think you know flips a switch. Destroying Germans had a huge financial incentive behind it. Not to mention their vindictive nature when they feel bested by a gentile.And I will say this. I think a lot of the Trump hatred is because Trump, for all intents and purposes, is the first Jewish president. At least in the popular mind. New Yorker. Big finance. And they are livid that he got there ahead of them.

                During WWII Russian Orthodox priests paradropped from German aircraft to blow up or photograph Soviet infrastructure. Why did they do it? Because they rightly surmised they would be allowed to practice their religion under the Nazi regime but not under Communism.from Rudel, Hans Ulrich. “Stuka Pilot.”Now I take up the file of photographs of the factories in question and study them with interest. I see that a high percentage of them are already underground and are therefore partly unassailable from the air. The photographs show the dam and the power station and some of the factory buildings; they have been taken during the war. How can this have been done? I think back to my time in the Crimea and put two and two together. When I was stationed at Sarabus and keeping myself fit by a little putting the weight and discus throwing after operations a black-painted aircraft often used to land on the airfield, and very mysteriously passengers alighted. One day one of the crew told me under the seal of secrecy what was going on. This aircraft carried Russian priests from the freedom-loving states of the Caucasus who volunteered for important missions for the German command. With flowing beards and dressed in clerical garb each of them carried a little packet on his chest, either a camera or explosives according to the nature of his mission. These priests regarded a German victory as the only chance of regaining their independence and with it their religious liberty. They were fanatical enemies of world Bolshevism and consequently our allies. I can still see them: often men with snow white hair and noble features as if chiselled out of wood.From the deep interior of Russia they brought back all kinds of photographs, were months en route and generally returned with their mission accomplished. If one of them disappeared he presumably gave his life for the sake of freedom, either in an unlucky parachute jump or caught in the act of carrying out his purpose or on his way back through the front. It made a profound impression on my mind when my informant described to me the way these holy men unhesitatingly jumped into the night, sustained by their faith in their great mission. At that time we were fighting in the Caucasus and they were dropped in different valleys in the mountains where they had relations with whose help they proceeded to organise resistance and sabotage. It all comes back to me as I puzzle over the origin of the photographs of these industrial plants.

                    In hisGulag Archipelago, Solshenitsyn writes at length about the huge numbers of Russian defectors supporting or even fighting for the Germans.Also, he describes the joy in his home town of Rostov-on-Don when the local Orthodox cathedral was reopened for church services by the German occupational authorities after it had been closed, due to the communist regime, for years, if not decades.

                        Conversely, and just proves the above points, Sozhenitsyn also points out how loyal Soviets who’d fought against the Germans and had the bad luck to be taken captive, upon release, or even voluntarily returning from the free West after the war, often were charged as traitors and shot or sent to the gulags. For their part, the Germans were more apt to treat the invaded peoples quite barbarically. Their exploitation of these Orthodox priests was just that. If they’d treated the conquered lands a bit more humanely (was that even possible?) it is quite possible the war would have had a different outcome.

        The rest of the world, particularly Europe, has noticed the United States has descended into totalitarian madness. This is a problem for the Empire, which has tried to import the same brand of anarcho-corporatism, for want of a better word, to the rest of the world. Chancellor Merkel’s muted criticism of the censorship of President Trump is something we never would have seen ten years ago.A name for the present regime will arrive. You will know it when there is an all-out campaign to suppress the label.The Woke/Anti-White insanity is a religion promoted as an opium of the madness. The primary purpose is to distract from the class-based nature of what is happening and to prevent a political and cultural movement to counter it. So far it has worked quite well.

                Ha.
I’m not even certain that fits because “liberal” implies some beliefs antithetical to the present system. But even if it could have been shoehorned to work, yeah, that grifter already had ruined the term. Incidentally, I read he plagiarized much of his material from the Claremont Institute (I think), which is irrelevant in a way but quite funny.

                I will add, I have a very close relationship with a woman (well she sleeps with me) who works at a large corporation that builds undersea fiber links. Two companies buying intercontinental being built now are Google and Facebook, They are not just renting wavelengths but buying the entire active cable. One of the cool features in these modern-day links is the ability to not just recreate and amplify optical data but to have switches built into the undersea splitter nodes. They can shut-off or slow down the high-speed (as opposed to satellite data links) internet connectivity between whole continents. However, thinking about that, 100’s of thousands of deplorables pass innumerable aerial fiber nodes daily. I guess they too could be switches of sorts.

                Cryptocorporate Totalitarianism.Communism is almost completely non-applicable because the major corporations own the gumperment and its feckless members rather than the other way around. We’ve officially hit all the tenets of totalitarianism. The political class always recites the script about hating the big corps and “making them pay their fair share” etc., but its all puppetry. And whilethe love affair between big tech and big gov is no secret, the continual usurpation on our basic freedoms and privacy takes place most effectively in the shadows of the webverse. Then, when the big tech corps want to avoid a temporary dip in their stock prices and require a little secrecy and plausible deniability, they unleash their army of nerd pawns with unlimited resources to quietly dox, silence, or de-platform anyone who dares criticize their moral (and total) authority with complete and unbridled support from the political class. The new “means of production” is information, and while the House of Hymen in DC may not own the techies, the techies are happy to do their bidding to continue the globalist back scratching cycle. Crazy that a movement can be so secretive and so overt simultaneously. If you don’t go quietly in the shadows they’ll cancel you publicly in the streets, and vice versa.

                “Oligarchy”, anyone?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchyAccording to Michels, all organizations eventually come to be run by a “leadership class”, who often function as paid administrators, executives, spokespersons or political strategists for the organization. Far from being “servants of the masses”, Michels argues this “leadership class,” rather than the organization’s membership, will inevitably grow to dominate the organization’s power structures. By controlling who has access to information, those in power can centralize their power successfully, often with little accountability, due to the apathy, indifference and non-participation most rank-and-file members have in relation to their organization’s decision-making processes. Michels argues that democratic attempts to hold leadership positions accountable are prone to fail, since with power comes the ability to reward loyalty, the ability to control information about the organization, and the ability to control what procedures the organization follows when making decisions. All of these mechanisms can be used to strongly influence the outcome of any decisions made ‘democratically’ by members.

            No matter what is settled on as a ‘proper’ name at the end of the day there is one thing it is 100% as it has all the hallmarks of one. It is a Theocracy.
The Islamic Republic of Iran most resembles the current leftist incarnation of the US government. Instead of Allah you simply swap Diversity and the rest of oppressive regimes edicts &amp; customs fall into place neatly. Further, the dissenters are going to start getting treatment that is closer &amp; closer in nature to what you’d see in a place like that.

            “anarcho-corporatism”!

By gum, I can’t stand the foggy abstract terms our enemies invented. People end up sounding like woke feminist undergrads arguing such vague idiocies as “socialism vs capitalism”.

Give me terms that describe the means and method, such as ‘anarcho-corporatism.’

        It’s pretty easy to get blackpilled with all this stuff.  When you realize the state, corpacracy, academia, media etc., is one yuge hive minded blob that won’t accept any dissent, period.  There’s virtually no place to turn – sure, we can have our own little communities, for now.  But it’s like being on a life raft in a turbulent sea of madness.  It’s going to take something significant to upend this apple cart – I just hope it’s a lot sooner than later.  With the left going balls to the wall, it may very well be.

Its true, its like a mind virus, with common symptoms. People catch it, and can’t let it go.
Which is why it can almost be compared to a religion, or a cult.

        Trump is getting cut off from banking if media reports are true.  He has around $400 million in debt on his properties, which are probably worth $1 billion.  If he cannot find a new lender he will have to sell some properties to make good on the debt.  Passing a law requiring all Americans to have access to a bank account should have been an early priority for him.  He truly must not have understood they would take it this far.

            I think this is true. Trump was the ultimate Civic Nationalist and really could not accept how evil so many of his countrymen could be. Not going after Big Finance and Big Tech was a massive mistake. To be fair, I didn’t see how bad this could become, either.

                Trump has plenty of assets, he has just been cut off by the banks.  There is no reason to think is real estate portfolio is full of distressed properties, but he has to be able to roll over the debt on them.

            That’s the next big step, one that I thought was a decade or so away but maybe it’s closer than I thought.
Denying people banking and credit card access if you have bad thoughts. Trump will find another bank. But how long is it until getting your name on a list means that Visa, Mastercard and, even, Discover, won’t do business with you. Or the banks will do business with you.
That’s when the real cancel culture begins. These banks banning Trump just crossed a line.

        “You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.”“Divide and conquer.”They are coming after us with a vengeance, that much is clear. It’s become very easy on their part, why? Because we are not unified. We may be “armed to the teeth” but until we use those arms in a unified way as any army would, we are atomized and when the Stasi show up at our doors at 3 AM, not even your neighbor will be able to come to your aid. The Left is counting on this.Until we have a Hannibal, Alexander, Frederick, Washington, Patton return to our midst to UNIFY us, we are toast. Even in your log cabin in the middle of Montana you are no longer safe.The Left knows you will comply. They bank on it. Oh, and now they control the banks too.

            I’d like to think I’d go down shooting. I have no family, so what do I have to lose?  That Solzehnisyn quote about individuals standing up to those raids, stuck with me. Those citizens didn’t have guns either.
He said if those police started thinking they might not live through their shift, they might start to drag their feet on rounding up their fellow Russians.

                And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?… The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin’s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If…if…We didn’t love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation…. We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.Aleksandr I.

                Agree, but even better to band together with others in a White community – and report your woke neighbors for some thought or speech crime right before you move.  All it takes is an accusation, on the neighborhood website or to the local gossip.

                    That’s going to be a major saving grace for us. I have lots of experience with college kids. To say they have the attention span of goldfish is an insult to goldfish, who are chess grand masters by comparison. I’m not saying everything’s going to be fine — everything is going to be shit, for a long time — but just keeping your head down lets you duck a lot, because they’re as lazy as they are arrogant.

                            True. Social media has really shortened attention spans, I think. The immediate gratification of meaningless “likes,” and moving on to get something else “liked,” is being played out off line now.

                I teach these people and they are soft.  They have lots of hard men to fight for them as long as the money flows. But the top echelon ivy league kids will not be able to deal w any real violence.    Its not like i am hard as nails but i boxed and i know that only a few of the athletes could take a punch.

            Turn off their electricity and we will see how little power they really have.Really their strength is based on not sheer force of numbers or legions of hard men but on having control of communications. If they’re server farms go dark and the cell towers get no juice they become impotent,. Their few enforcers then become isolated and easily dealt with.

        We will not see true fascism or communism from either the politicos or the corporations. They may try, but they can only fail. Those people are so pathetic that real commies would purge cretins like Biden and Pelosi. The fascists would send them straight to the lime pits or the ovens.I think these guys are best defined by CH as “shitlibs”. They are morons that temporarily have the field. They’ll either break the country up, or they’ll be overthrown by the real commies, fascists… or Americans.

            I often recommend Gottfried’s book Fascism, History of an Idea, because he covers all the flavors of fascism. The roots concept that holds them all together is the combination of absolute state power and corporate power. In theory, the other seat at the table was for labor, but in reality the state took it upon themselves to speak for labor. This is what we see in our age.

                    They don’t need steel, their hatred of BadWhites is more than sufficient.  They will send you or any BadWhite neighbor to camps or the guillotine on a whim, because life is entirely digital and anything which upsets their sense of ‘specialness’ must be banished.  Give the eternally resentful nerds and fat cat ladies and browns/blacks/yellows trappings of power and office and high tech means to enforce their will, and it’s as simple as Wonderland’s Queen – “Off with their heads.”

                The current regime lacks fundamental characteristics that make fascism a misleading descriptor. Most notably, fascism was nationalist movement mean to serve a specific race/ethnicity. The current regime denies the concept of race/ethnicity (but comically, not “racism”). They are dead set on marginalizing the founding stock of the country. Mass immigration was the exact opposite of fascist policy.Second, the fascist regimes of the last century used government power to improve the lot of the common man. Many progressives in the US were initially supportive of the fascist regimes — and back then the progressive movement was focused on the well being of working class families, trust busting, etc., not on b*tt sex and mentally ill men in skirts. Today’s regime hates the (white) working class and has deputized the tech monopolies to serve as the thought police and destroy the lives of bad thinkers and their families.Finally, the fascist regimes focused on building up thenationaleconomy. (One of the reasons for German expansion under the Nazis was to gain access to natural resources.) Today’s regime are hyper-globalists.

                    A more fundamental question: All the social changes point to a deterioration, a weakening of the country (ours or others). Is this all actually part of an evil long range plan? Perhaps. If so, who is most likely to benefit? If it’s actually just rot caused (mostly) by unintended consequences of good intentions, similarly: What opportunistic outside powers are likely to mop up in the end?

                If the camps and boxcars  come it’s because whites were not capable of resisting.  In essence the camps and boxcar rides only happen when the population has accepted defeat.TPTB wouldn’t dare do this to the Muzzies or Hispanics who would gut them like trout if they tried.Seriously our rulers are scared of them because they are tribal as hell and have organized crime elements that are very well armed and next to impossible to infiltrate. Heck the Hispanics already practice ethnic cleansing against the blacks and no one says a thing because they are afraid.

        Georges Sorel, who had a few ideas worth looking at, might call it “anarcho-syndicalism.” There is a long tradition of anti-Marx critique *from the Left* that has some things to teach us – Proudhon was a hard core Socialist who predicted that Marxian socialism would end in tyranny and gulags, for instance. Bakunin was a psycho, but a perceptive one, and so on.

Also, that progress is inevitable, and that there are new evils, and new goods.

                                        “Only Conservatives are dumb enough to allow someone with opposing values to program them or brainwash their kids”﻿Yes. And only conservatives are dumb enough to not understand the importance of controlling the school system. As long as conservatives can send their kids to private school or homeschool, they are willing to let the the people who hate them use their tax money to brainwash the vast majority of kids to hate whites and conservatives.Unless conservatives plan for their children to be survivalists with no contact with modern society, their children therefore  will be seen as the enemy of most of society and will have virtual targets on their back. Conservatives aren’t able to unstand that. Liberals would never tolerate their tax money going to schools that teach conservative values and denounce BLM, men in dresses being women, etc

                                            There should not be a ‘school system.’  American literacy was highest was children were taught by parents, dame schools, and then private schools for those who were capable of continuing.  We don’t need to engage with ‘modern society;’ we need to construct our own, White society.

                                                Yes. There shouldn’t be a school system but in the meantime conservatives and the dissident right pay taxes to a system that teaches students to hate them. You will go to jail if you don’t pay taxes so the next best thing is to fight back and gain control of that system in red areas. It is especially absurd that taxpayers in red areas are letting leftist schools run wild at taxpayer expense and not putting a stop to it.

                    .The Tabula Rasa has been the defining belief of leftism for the last three-four hundred years.
But now they are embracing the concept oforiginal sin–  being white – genetically European is inherently privileged and therefor sinful – with no redemption possible.
Not sure how that internal contradiction will resolve or if it will tear their movement apart.

Voting is a skill not a right, letting everyone with a pulse vote isn’t Democracy it is the beginning of tribal warfare and mob rule. Gather up enough tribal alliances, temporary or not, to get a majority, and then vote to destroy the minority. Repeat.

            Is there any other kind of socialism?Anarchosyndicalism is pretty much communes all over. Ukraine tried it, they had some of that noble-crazy Bakunin spirit, but was defeated and failed just the same. The experiences of Spanish anarchists were lamer even, as during the civil war most wouldn’t keep the needed discipline. Thus some societal cephalization is needed for logistics purposes, as long as it’s balanced to the local and traditional.I’d prefer Distributism (best), but you can call it nationalsyndicalism or guild socialism if you want the s-words that much. Really any more or less fancy third-way position name would work.

        No amount of lying can change that realty and eventually, there will be a word for it.
Oh, there’s a word for it. Our rulers are using whatever parts of various “ism” movements of the past – fascism, communism, etc. – work to solidify their power and bring pain to their ancient enemy.
There’s no word describing the current political philosophy because it’s not a philosophical movement. It’s an ethnic group ruling over other ethnic groups out of fear and hatred and a feeling of superiority. There’s nothing deeper to what going on.

But respectable historians might be too squeamish to use it.
I did find it funny to hear the term, though, in a book review by one of the more respectable and genteel right-wing book reviewers, Charles of the Worthy House:

                    I’ve seen a Hillary-esque US ambassador puff her chest out and proudly introduce a vibrant deputy chief of mission (#2 in the embassy) and his white, Swiss husband in a developing Islamic country.

The local VIPs were not amused.

The happy couple were the gay BFFs of a few dozen ambassadors’ wives.

        OT: Sometimes I agree with David Cole over at Takis, but he swung and missed today. His column is anangry rant against the Capitol protest.“Look how leftists occupied the Wisconsin State Capitol during the 2011 anti–Scott Walker protests!” “Look how leftists occupied this park and that city hall and that bank lobby during the Occupy Wall Street protests!”And as I read those posts and DMs, all I could think of was thesceneinRed Dawn(no, not the remake, which doesn’t exist in my universe) between Colonel Bella and General Bratchenko, and the three words Bratchenko used to shoot down Bella’s advocation of U.S. Vietnam War tactics:Y perdieron, Ernesto.“And they lost, Ernesto.”The anti-Kavanaugh occupierslost. The 2011 anti-Walker occupierslost. The Occupy Wall Street occupierslost(in that their months-long exercise in poor hygiene and rape changednothingregarding Wall Street). Smart humans would look at those losses and say, “That’s a tactic I shall not try.” But the right doesn’t have many smart humans. It haschildrenwho look at those unsuccessful tactics and say, “Weeeeee, that looks like a hoot! Let’s fail like them, knowing that we’ll be judged harsher for it!”Except, no, they didn’t lose. Who has the power now? The forces behind the Kavanaugh protests, the forces opposed to Scott Walker, the forces behind Occupy Wall Street. Only a fool thought that Occupy Wall Street was about actually making changes on Wall Street. The deluded fools camping in the street may have thought so, but the money and organization behind the scenes came from people who got rich off Wall Street. Those protests weren’t unsuccessful. They accomplished exactly what they set out to accomplish. Cole just doesn’t understand that what they were trying to accomplish was something besides the moment. His focus on “those unsuccessful tactics” belies the fact that he missed thestrategy.If only we’d being playing with an equally effective strategy, using public demonstration and the ever-present whiff of street violence to intimidate and cow our enemies.

            I think you are on to something. Those leaders, we don’t have, may emerge in a climate of permanent protest. BLM, ANTIFA won, because they did something, slow and steady month after month.

        Start small.Asking people with the attention span of a hummingbird to “read this book/ essay” or “watch this podcast” is a bridge to far.  Try it on your basset hound.  The results will be the same.Chilling and grilling is a real thing: people want to be left alone.  Pointing out that they live in a one party dictatorship is not REAL to them.  They have always voted and they think having a chance to vote again in the next election is the solution.Drop small hints for those who can be made aware, talk about the weather or something else harmless for those who would destroy you (“Did you see this week’s picture of Queen Kamahema on the latest cover of X magazine?”) and plan like your life depends on it.

            chilling and grilling is the domain of people with a 110 IQ
There are going to be way more of them than people like us.  It takes quite a bit of brain power to see through the charade.  Also takes intellectual courage, but you have to at least have an intellect.  These other people simply don’t have the juice.
People will find their role when the time comes, I have to think.  Always seems to be the case.

This is good sense, not to stress because so many people cannot understand what is happening around them. It has always been thus. All empires die. We are not the first people to find ourselves as leaves in the hurricane of a collapsing society. I have no doubt it was the same for our predecessors.

            They have always voted and they think having a chance to vote again in the next election is the solutionIf nothing else, I am hopeful that the current election shenanigans will disabuse at least a fair number of them of this delusion. Perhaps that is the best thing the Trump presidency has done for this country.110 IQ is more than enough to grasp the current farce that is this country. I think it has more to do with wishful thinking that it will all turn out OK in the end rather than an actual lack of sufficient mental chops, at least for the 110 crowd.In other words, it is more a matter of will than intellect.

                Yes, but 110 or above includes 25% of the population? Even if all were willing, that’s a lot of clueless people to overcome in the remaining 75%.

        Any thoughts on Curtis Yarvin’s latest screeds on power? His last post goes on about oligarchic power (i.e. the power structure in the US) and spontaneous coordination, and applies his base thesis that the madness we’re seeing is not being wielded by any particular person or group, but is an organic formation borne by predatory human instincts, or something. Therefore the likes of Jamie Dimon are not commanding corporate fascism, rather are subservient to the whims of the predatory ether. I’m still trying to wrap my head around this Talmudry.

I generally like Yarvin. He has his own biases of course, but someone on our side that is willing to put ideas into the public is doing us a service. Don’t let prefect be the enemy of good.

                    I’m not 100% sure I agree with Yavin, but I think his perspective on oligarchic power might make sense.I read the article, and this is my TLDR: founders don’t control the ideology of their companies. Rather they are controlled by the press or “cathedral”. There is no easy way to regulate this now (i.e., Section 230 repeal doesn’t offer clear solution).Yarvin has worked in tech and lived in the Bay Area for a long time, so when he talks about how tech companies operate I tend to think he might be right. His article discusses oligarchs/tech in the abstract, but I would imagine he knows people at the top of the big companies in the valley. For example, I would be surprised if he didn’t have some connection to Peter Thiel. And, of course, Thiel funded Zuckerberg, so if Yarvin knows Thiel at all he knows Zuckerberg as well — if not in person, then through Thiel. Now he can’t write an article that says “this is what Zuckerberg thinks” without disclosing personal information, but maybe he can describe Zuckerberg’s thought process in general in an article. So, basically, if we make a few reasonable assumptions about what Yarvin knows, we maybe get a valuable piece of correct information regarding how tech operates. Which is important at this moment as censorship descends on dissidents on the right.I also work in tech (but I much less connected than Yarvin). IMO, tech founders these days are introverted beta incels with STEM backgrounds. Once they get rich they have the freedom to be uninvolved in the day to day operation of their companies (Musk is exception here), which they are happy to do since they don’t like talking to people. So the people that push/make key decision regarding censorship  might not the founders, but people a layer below them (e.g., Susan Wojcicki types). Big tech these days hire out of Ivey league and top international schools. For sure, these companies don’t look anything like the American demographic. And while the company founder might be a white dude, if we look at the company as a whole there are lots of ivory tower STEM people (again, most of these guys have never worked a blue collar type job), woke ladies, asian STEM types, LGTB/token minorities etc all having no connection to or sympathy for core Americans. So the structure is setup where the top guy is checked out and personnel in the org as a whole has no interest in representing tradition US citizen values or interests. This, IMO, is the origin of the bias.

        Debate about political semantics is, in my experience, a black hole. A lot goes in, and no light comes out.
Instead of a forced repurposing of old words which carry many and contradictory old connotations, I just use “left-wing totalitarianism” for their thing.

        Trump was actually wrong on Section 230.  The repeal would have ended in more censorship not less.  The BIG problem is the FAILURE of the FTC to break up big business since the mid 1980s.  It’s been toothless, allowing rampant consolidation.  And here we are.  We look at tech today, but it’s with everything from airlines to banks to box stores.  The financialization of the economy speeds it up even more.  The transparent collusion in shutting down Parler (which happened to be overrated) shows ZERO fear of big business.  Even Boeing shows NO fear as it’s shitty planes with Pajeet programmed software fall out of the sky.  The future is duopolies pretending to compete.  Do you want to fly United or American?  Do you want to bank with Chase or B of A?  Either way you lose.

        “The result is we have the self-proclaimed fascists reinforcing the premise put forward by the actual fascists that they cannot possible be fascists, because they are not white.”This is starting to get confusing. I tend to fall back to Heinlein’s formulation:“Political tags – such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth – are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire. The former are idealists acting from highest motives for the greatest good of the greatest number. The latter are surly curmudgeons, suspicious and lacking in altruism.  But they are more comfortable neighbors than the other sort.”

            The problem that you will have with this “those who want people to be controlled” and those who don’t division is that almost all the people who don’t want to be controlled are white.
But there will be some non-whites who satisfy this criterion. And then those non-whites, due to inherent racial tribalism, will loudly complain that they do not see enough people who look like them in this new group and that they feel oppressed, and the cycle in which we find ourselves begins again.
Racial tribalism is deeper than ideology.

        There was a really good article by Alexander Macris over at substack that showed how a lot of corporate tyranny is actually dictated — required — by government regulations. Basically, the government forces the private sector to engage in the repression and discrimination it isn’t allowed to do itself.
Macris’ substack site has vanished, but it’s available at the wayback machine and it’s worth a read:

            Whatever it is we have, it’s dependent on electricity.  Lots of it
I think the blockchain discussion the other was helpful for me.   I wasn’t aware that it took so much electricity and processing power to generate a Bitcoin
i think there is something similar in the petty tyranny we see today.  Without electricity, what they gonna do?   Can’t deplatform someone if their computer doesn’t work.  Can’t dox someone.  On and on.

                    Oh for sure, anyone taking about taking out a grid is retarded and/or a federal agent
But what happens if we do go green?  What happens if all of a sudden there isn’t the cheap electricity to power the devices and broadband i the way we were accustomed to?
Would AOC even be a household name if not for the internet?  How much of their “power” as it were is dependent on lots and lots of cheap electricity to get their faces out to us?

Similarly, look at the Woke.
This is a class of people that would not exist without the Internet and a large, well-funded academic environment.
Look at what has happened to schools and universities in the last year. Weaker universities are going bankrupt. Homeschooling is way up.
Parents are balking at the trash critical race/gender theory curriculum. They are also balking at mandatory WuFlu vax to return to school.
These are all good things that reduce the influence of the Woke in the world.

                            People are pretty blissfully unaware of the fact that cheap, reliable power is perhaps the one, and only one, true competitive advantage of the territory of the American Empire and yes they’re clueless enough to ruin that too.  It’s like “taking down the grid”, if someone is patient they can just wait ten years for when the brown horde is in charge of maintaining/stealing it all and the grid will be taken down all on it’s own.

                                The lunatic Left are well aware of this.
The point of the Green New Deal is to make the Western power grid so expensive and unreliable that production has to move to China or similar cheap labor countries.
Further punishing the Deplorables is simply a bonus.
Saving the environment is the skinsuit disguising the real goal.

                                    Reminds me of finding out last year that all our recycling was being sent to China.  40 years of separating trash, picking it up in separate trucks, and putting it on ships, so the Chinese could dump it, while we felt morally superior about it.

                            I’ve been devoting more of my several hours per day reading and debating climate change and related topics, green energy (wind, solar) or electric vehicles. It’s the ideal balance of controversial without the highly caustic dangers of arguing race realism 😀Takeaway (remember, I’m a skeptic): the entire scheme has so many fatal flaws. Man-made climate change? Most of the claims are junk science. Green power or EVs are more interesting, because these actually exist and are being promoted, nay, mandated in some areas, and built out. The tech actually works, no one denies that. The bottom line is murky and hidden, and the promoters rarely, if ever, give reliable figures. In fact, you might think they were trying to hide some thing 🙂 I’m pretty sure the “Green” tech is, in the majority of cases, not competitive with existing power (fossil/nuke). The advocates for this stuff have enthusiasm that borders on the religious at times, including stating articles of faith that seem at odds with science.Europe is further down the rabbit hole than the USA, but we are close behind, and it’ll accelerate under the incoming regime. I can’t predict the future of course, but there is a reason most of my stock market money is in fossil fuels, and not Tesla and the Windmills and Solar Panel companies.I’m hoping the foolishness will halt some day, or else we’re all going to be a Woke-topia with people of color living in harmony, with all electrical power derived from sunshine and breezes, to power our homes and charge our EVs. What could possibly go wrong with such an idyllic vision?

                        Our power grid is quite frail as it is. Worse if we go “Green” it means taking NG, nuclear, oil and coal fired power plants off line which will gut  our ability to maintain our current usage level. IOW we will get lots of rolling black outs across the U.S.Worse, the cost of electricity will skyrocket. and you folks with NG stoves and heating systems will have to scrap them and buy electric replacements.But wait it gets better. All consumer products and food will cost lots more as well.The good news is the BigTech server farms will still have all electricity they need.

                Such a good catch. We’re a culture catching up to a new technology.





Profound and significant. As significant as the screens they power- and the constant forced “focus, focus, focus” of TV that rewires our kids’ young brains.


(Hint: No TV before age three!)

                    The BigTech titans won’t even let their kids have a tablet before age 10-12. As they know full well it interferes with the neurological development in young children.They even send their kids to schools where the devices are not allowed period.In short the BigTech peeps know full well what they are peddling is toxic to human beings and destructive as hell to the social fabric.

            Excellent article. I watched an interview with Darren Beattie where he made a very similar point: that Big Tech is pretty much integrated into the security apparatus of the State – to the point where there’s a revolving door between NSC/State Dept and Silicon Valley. It’s why the Legislature never takes any meaningful steps against censorship.

        I think Jonathan Bowden called our situation “left-wing capitalism.”

That’s not a bad summary. If you think about it, capitalism has never been right-wing or conservative according to any real definitions of those words.

It doesn’t promote a sound mind or sound body for the individual. And as for groups, it absolutely shreds families, communities, races, and nations.

                That’s why I use Kapitalism.
My Cliff Notes understanding of Marx’s ‘Das Kapital’ is that some rich men soon discover that shifting resources from factory workers to lobbyists creates a far more exciting game.

Edit: I just realized that “Liberal Fascism” is indeed entirely appropriate.

            I hope McConnell does it. One of Trump’s greatest accomplishment is his discrediting of the Republican establishment. Love getting these senators votes on the record to understand where they stand.
IMO, Republican senate is almost entire a rat’s nest. Cruz looking pretty good in Texas, otherwise alot of Quisling vibes.

        The essence of it is anti-white/anti-normalcy fascism, but we need a better name.  It’s closer to fascism than classical communism because it’s racialized and because of the cooperation between corporation and state.  But it’s not classical fascism because of its inversion of values.  Satanic fascism perhaps, except Satan doesn’t have the same ring today as it used to.

                    I have a similar sense of thingsThe feminine nature of it all and their inability to keep a focus on anything for too long is why I, unlike many here, don’t take this “totalitarianism” that seriously. I think it is very serious if you get caught in the crosshairs, sure, but what I mean is more its long-term viability.  And the minute a serious world event occurs, whatever it may be, all of it will be forgotten or either subordinated to its rightful place at the bottom of the totem pole.Not to mention that it is built on electricity, perhaps superfluous electricity.  Spare electricity.    If there is ever a rationing of electricity, such as in a natural disaster or power outage, someone’s Twitter feed is going to be the last thing anyone cares about when you need to focus the electricity you have into necessities.Why going green may not be a bad idea after all lol.  Like I was saying yesterday, there is a lot of internal contradictions in the liberal program where exploiting them and infiltrating the democratic party may be a path to consider.  Obviously they are not aware of how dependent their schemes (doxing, etc) are on the abundance of cheap electricity to power all of these internet devices and the associated bandwidth.   Try doing all of this when yo are getting your electricity from windmills.

                        I have to disagree.  Stalin deliberately decimated his officer corps when they were most needed, but the Russians came together and fought like hell against the Germans anyhow.  It helped that the Germans spurned the Ukrainians who initially welcomed them as liberators, but patriotism is a powerful force.  Come a national crisis (losing a regional conflict to China, or whomever) and a lot of normies will snap into patriotard mode.  They’re wired that way, and the smallhats and womyn count on that.

There was both carrot and stick involved.
Soviet propaganda did a complete shift from repression of to acceptance of Russian nationalism and tolerance of Orthodox symbolism. This was a major retreat.
Also, not to be underestimated is that it was an existential war and the Russians KNEW IT. If they lost, their fates were certain to be either slavery or (for most) death.

                                Have to disagree. What you say fits the Soviet national purpose DURING the war, but after the war the Soviets were brutal with the Ukranians, with anyone unfortunate enough to have been a POW or a civilian under German occupation. A lot of them ended up being accused of being a traitor etc., so shot or off to Gulag. In other words, no better, indeed worse, than were or would have been under the Germans, and that “reward” for being loyal to the Motherland. Stalin’s treachery is on a scale rarely equalled in world history. Things improved markedly after his death, early 1950s.

                My Italian grandfather summed it up thusly:
Communism was Jewish, and Fascism was Catholic
There was a significant religious battle to it that no one is allowed to mention anymore but that’s how people on the ground saw it and understood it.  It was common knowledge.

        I think it’s time to just drop out of the political conversation and live life.  It’s clear to me that we have been hurled into the ditch of history from the point of view of big political trends.  I can live with that.  There’s a lot more to life than getting involved in all of this stress.  I am a listener to the podcast and I enjoy your blog posts.  Do I ever see myself voting or donating to political candidate again?  No.  It’s like I just immigrated to a foreign country.  I am not a part of this.  I want to enjoy life and go for walks and cook good food and let it all drift by.  I don’t even speak the language.

        It’s no different than how a magician uses distraction to get the audience looking one way while he some other sleight of hand. Even though you know he does not possess magical powers, you are amazed nonetheless.
Devon Tracey pointed out the opposite phenomenon: how you try to get people focused on something, and they can’t help looking at the wrong hand. In his inimitable phrasing, “I’m pointing to the turd and like dogs, you’re looking at my finger.”

        I took today’s essay as a bit of rebuke to those of us who emphasize the communistic aspect of our adversaries. I understand the objection on the one hand since the power elite at the helm of this version of totalitarian oppression are the immensely wealthy monopolists. On the other hand the methods and philosophical underpinnings they utilize to motivate the movement, the moral universe they promote, borrows significantly from ideas promoted by the Frankfurt cabal. To whatever degree the Frankfurt totalitarians were communist I think it is fair to attribute the same label to today’s oppressors. I believe it is useful to make that association explicitly, to  associate in peoples minds the unparalleled scale of suffering and misery achieved by this ideology and attempt to evoke a response appropriate to the threat of such a calamity.

                China CCP Inc? Aren’t our corporate masters all Jack Ma? Seems Communism is very compatible with corporations. Wal Mart and Apple are at this point owned one way or another by China CCP inc.It’s a good label. No one likes traitors allied with a nasty foreign power that can’t even make quality goods.

                I know enough about politics that “Communist” regimes, at least USSR and later China, deviated wildly from the ideals, they were anything but Communist in practice. Sort of like comparing the Christianity propounded in the Gospels to what followed in execution.

            I agree with those pointing out that “communist” is hackneyed and even a badge of honor with many, but the point remains that we need a continually evolving lexicon of insults and terms of derision.  DESTROYING them with FACTS and REASON is a fool’s errand.  They’re middling intellects, mediocrities of the highest order, who fancy themselves the best and the brightest.  Every time you laugh at their pretensions, it cuts to the bone and puts them on the defensive.  Every term that we use to tar them, like NPC, should be instantly recognizable as shining a spotlight on their shortcomings.

                To add one thought, the reason NPC is more effective than commie, is that former pulls them out from the herd, paints them as an outsider, which they can’t stand.  Calling them a commie allows them to believe they’re part of a team, which is reassuring to them.  The insult has to be very personal.

        The communist allowed himself to be on the leash though, in exchange for eternal tenure in their public institution or ngo or union board of choice, and the ability real or imagined to punch natsees. Whether from the left or right, and/or whether anarchist or bourgeois, materialism breeds comfort, then dysgenics.
And I’d argue this is internationalist fascism you speak about, Z. The nationalist kind is okay, provided some popular representation and not just corporate.

        Many years back, it was promoted with great concern that Google and YouTube’s recommendations led to greater radicalism. A viewer would watch a normiecon video, then he’d get a paleocon recommendation, then from that a more radical rightwing recommendation and next thing you know he’d be at American Renaissance.Of course, once that was realized, it was easy for YouTube to subvert, even reverse.I have noticed lately that all my recommendations nudge me back in the normiecon direction. I’ve never gotten a recommendation for the Zman’s Power Hour, but I get Uncommon Knowledge with John Robertson, hosting John Podhoretz; Dave Rubin hosting David Murray, Dave Rubin hosting Tulsi Gabbard and gushing about how he’d be excited to be a Democrat again if more Democrats were like her (Feminist, egalitarian, open borders globalists, apparently).

            I got a recommendation to a “Worthy House” book review on youtube a year ago. I found Charles’s website (Z man has link to website on his homepage) I think after watching a Christopher Caldwell talk. I found Alt Hype on youtube as well (though he has moved most of his content to bitchute recently). There is still good stuff on youtube but most of the good stuff isn’t being watched much.

        I’ll add that Democrats are supposed to be the party of party-hearty. Instead the third term of Obama will see:Bailouts to States and local governments, but not enough to replace every year the massive tax loss of business closed forever by Covid and George Floyd riots.Continued White baiting constantly from corporations and government as the only glue that holds each together internally.Nothing for White people, either workers or small business owners.Race-based rationing of food as the Green New Deal ships all food to China. Whites starving or widespread poaching.Race based rationing of health care. No Whites need apply.Mass firings of nearly every Trump voter or those friends/family with same — roughly 100 million in total.Mass adoption of black market (can be as simple as barbers operating in homes, backyards etc) and massive cash only transactions.Collapse in retail spending matched with active boycotts of big corp.Bailouts to BigCorp that fail to make them whole as China CCP Inc turns to internal demand for growth and the US is in deep depression.

        The point of the Big Lie as described by “that guy” is that it took the power of the state to suppress the truth and also implicit was that the state had to be powerful and admired for delivering results.Currently the state is despised by most everyone for lockdowns that make no sense, and are flouted routinely by the ruling class and privileged non-Whites. While the ruling class and state/corporations bait Whites. That’s difficult even for ruling class Whites larping as honorary non-Whites with good times: media, university, ngo, government types. For those out of work, gigging in the defacto black market economy, its an insult from a government that degrades not improves quality of life.One of the reasons FDR got popular in a hurry was abolishing Prohibition. We now have the modern equivalent … masks and lockdowns for another year plus at least.

        Calling what is happening Marxism is so stupid only the dullards accept it.
At the risk of being a dullard, I find there is a strong element of Marxism in the discourse on the left. What you’re really positing is that Marxism is opposed to corporatism, whereas the events of this past year might suggest they are allies.

            I agree. It is an alliance based on shared hatred of their common enemy: us. The marxists have no problems being the handmaidens of corporatism as long as we are in the crosshairs.

                Conservatives and dissident rightists are reluctantly adopting the oppressor/oppressed paradigm because they are the oppressed today.
For decades we derided liberals for seeing most people as victims. Now, we’re doing it. But this time it is true.

        It seems bitterly appropriate that the Big Lie theory (great name for a sitcom!) has gotten the Big Lie treatment. As always, they accuse YOU of what THEY are doing.The Big Lie of course relies on their chief characteristic: chutzpah. The big dumb goy can’t believe someone could tell such a huge, obvious lie, because, of course, he couldn’t do such a thing and keep his self-esteem.Yes, America never had fascism or communism because both are ways to organize the lumpenproles, (grabastic amphibious shit, as Sgt Hartman would say) and America is a bourgeois society. Communism was clearly brought here by dirty immigrants (thanks, Europe) but fascism never really took off in response because even the poorest American thinks he could be middle class someday, or at least is just as good as any bourgeois (if he knows the term at all; remember “city slicker”?)What’s ironic is that “the New Right” featured costumed LARPers and keyboard commandos who are perfectly happy to laud the Little Corporal. Real thinkers of the Right, like Spengler and Evola, recognized fascism as utterly plebian (though understandable and perhaps useful), not something to emulate: eg., “Hailgate.”  The normalization of communism and fascism points to the proletarization of American; even our ruling class are basically proles now.

Or us.That said, maybe if someone had something interesting to say and not just run of the mill pablum like we get from Conservative Inc they wouldn’t be censored.   The greatness would refuse to be silenced.Bottom line, the people being censored are mediocrities and are being treated as such.  And who cares?  How many times do we have to read the same talking points and approved narratives?  Like hearing Karl Rove speaking for years.I say shut them up.  Make room for us 😉

                I think there’s more to it than that. The rate and scope at which media is manipulating information have markedly increased — as has its proclivity for psychologically abusing the American public.
Sure, they censor mediocrities now, but who’s to say that mediocrity will mean the same thing tomorrow as it does today? Also, I can think of more than a few intelligent critics of the system who have since been silenced — particularly those who opposed the jab and public health measures.
It’s only a matter of time before this place goes down, too.

        Time’s a wastin’. We can’t stay on the sidelines forever.Step #2 – New Skills &amp; HabitsLearn to disappear in public. Walk through downtown or a mall, and closely observe others. Who stands out and what draws your eye? Clothing, colors, behaviors, posture, stride, facial expression, etc? Now you know what should be avoided. So practice what you’ve learned. Acquire bland, colorless clothing. Avoid eye contact. Don’t loiter or wander. Always walk like you’re going somewhere, but slowly. Extra credit. Deliverymen, maintenance men, and cable installers are reflexively ignored.

        Do you really think that The People would have took the path of non-violence if when they were cowering in their abodes waiting for the Bolsheviks to come for them. They realized that this was the end and these demons intended to kill them. They had nothing to lose why not try and kill them? Do any of you know that over the next 50 years the same Bolsheviks killed the Tsar and his family and 60 million of their fellow countrymen to prove that communism works through starvation and the Gun.I predict a long war there simply are not enough people to take us down if we fight. Just like the Maoists did in the cultural revolution .Instead of spreading Marxism we spread freedom block by block. By the means Provided by wisdom from above.I am not amused by any of this it is the sum of all my fears it is worse than any of you think. Most of you have never seen up close the destruction of these tyrants and the evil they represent. The Media has created a generation even 2 maybe that have no clue that governments since the turn of the 20th century have killed 250+million. These are worse than any Bolsheviks from the past these Demons are truly soulless individuals guided by Satan himself.DJT isn’t going to save us we are screwed! Unless… you people out there that seem to think this is just a short period of time and we will straighten it out in the next election get grip and realize that we just WON an election! and we had it stolen from us by switching 15 million votes! Start to come to terms with the fact they are coming for us and fast!!!! they will use everything we need to control us and they control it all think about it .They will get rid DJT before the end of this year they simply cannot allow him to live he is too dangerous to their plans. DJT in my opinion might just leave the country He said he would if he lost. I hope he survives….he really gave it his best…God bless him.I myself am outraged and furious at the lying cheating scum that  succeeded to destroy our country. This will not go well either way it plays out . Scores will die and you out there that think all will be well are fools. You that think that doing the same thing over and over will eventually get it right …But since Marx , Engle’s and Trotsky first created the communist manifesto how many success stories have we had ????? (0) It always ends in Death for millions and poverty and despair for the unfortunate who survive.How many countries have achieved what we have in 246 years? none!  We are the shining city on the hill where all who suffer what we are about to experience desire to be. Capitalism and the free republic has had great success everywhere it has been implemented as Law. And we for what Crazy insane reason going to abandon it and let the F’in Chinese take all we have worked for all our lives? Plunging the rest of the world into the same despair.Most of us out there have it better than the other 95 % of the world simply because of the freedoms provided to us by the bill of rights and the constitution. We as individuals are able to through hard work and abiding by the Law are able to create more wealth and have had a system out there that allows us the freedom to accumulate it and keep it. It is no accident it has created a lifestyles second to no where and future for many that choose to participate in the Civil society. Self determination for everyone , Work hard save your money don’t smoke crack and you too can succeed. I mean America is so great that you can be a complete idiot and get fabulously wealthy. Look at Gates , Styers ,Zuckerberg ETC…No one are angry you are not willing to fight for it? where is the outrage ? Do you think they will spare us? Do you want to wait till they come to your house take your kids and ship you off somewhere and kill you?No I’m not suggesting anything violent. When is your life ..My life all our lives worth fighting for ? Are you going to let them silence you is what I’m saying are you going to comply you had better start to think about civil disobedience in mass at the very least join a group get involve get mad …dam it!!! BUT at least don’t allow them to tell us this evil vile human being JOE won this election HE stole it!

        The Big Lie dates to (at least) 4th century AD:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credo_quia_absurdumThe early Church sometimes justified faith because the stated belief was impossible! Major religions make claims that are so absurd that it would place an impartial judge at risk of a laughing fit resulting in incontinence.In more secular (and modern) matters, we have The Big Lie in such uncontroversial (to our audience, not the wider public 😀 ) of racial differences, as well as the ongoing debate over man-caused climate change and what (if anything) can or should be done about it. Lies, lies, lies.It’s a fundamental human flaw: to believe in the pleasant untruth, while disregarding the unpleasant (and perhaps, much more important) reality.

            The Solid platform is worthless as an antidote to internet censorship. It could literally have the opposite effect, allowing for more efficient deplatforming.All your interactions on the Solid platform are based on your Solid ID. So, when a Solid social network decides that you arepersona non gratathey can ban you from all their apps efficiently and permanently, and, presumably, they can share their ban list with other Solid app creators.Solid is no more a friend of freedom than the people running the apps on its platforms, and there is no guarantee that those people will be more friendly to freedom than the internet at large.All Solid does is allow you to maintain control over your personal information. That’s not nothing, but it really isn’t the biggest problem dissident voices are facing. Plus, there will be numerous incentives for you to open your PoD to makers of apps you want to use, so in reality, your information will probably be little more private than it ever was.The Solid platform wouldn’t have kept the Solid equivalent of Twitter from banning tens of thousands of users for ideological reasons as Twitter just did.
