        Trump has employed two things which make dwarfs of his competition. He said of course he  will deport all the illegals. We know he doesn’t mean it, but he wasn’t going to be constrained inside a box designed to enervate thought  and speech. He was the only one.
And he will trash any reporter who thinks that he or she is going to play gotcha with him.

        “They may as well be sporting mullets and jorts or leisure suits and perms. Marco Rubio is a great candidate to beat Bill Clinton in the 1996 campaign. Today he sounds like a guy who just woke up from a 20-year slumber.”
“But he is the modern GOP. The only thing they are missing are guys with neck beards and ear gauges, perhaps a few trannies thrown in to make the pathetic freak show complete.”
Dude, you can’t be making me laugh like that. I just got out of surgery.
