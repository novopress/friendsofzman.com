        I was reminiscing recently with some old shipmates about Clinton‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask-Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù policy for gays in the military.  Today it seems quaint, kind of like an Andy Griffith show.  Then I see Biden bringing a transvestite onboard to ‚Äúadvise‚Äù on military policy.  Talk about decaying institutions ‚Ä¶ the DoD‚Äôs warrior class is on life support.

            Unfortunately, I‚Äôve felt compelled in recent months to at least gloss over the mainstream news. It‚Äôs not to be ‚Äúinformed‚Äù about anything but just to learn what the latest lies and half-truths the dumber people are going to be made to believe for the next week or so. If you are forced to live around zombies it helps to know where they‚Äôll be shambling off to next in search of brainzzz.it surprises even me just how overt and heavy handed the bias has become.  There‚Äôs no longer any attempt to be subtle at all, particularly when it comes to all things pertaining to the Orange One.

                Ahead of you by a few years. I just recently removed Unz except for Linh Dinh. Ron Unz himself has declined materially but Sailor et al. have nothing interesting to contribute. Older articles which are archived there and valuable but the covid and messicun stuff in recent times is fetid trash. It goes without saying that Fred Reed has been dead to me for years.

        Trump (inadvertently) did his job brilliantly and might pull off one last hurrah.The first Trump presidential campaign showed conservative Whites how much themediatruly hated them and that the media would lie, cheat and steal.Trump‚Äôs early years as president show conservative Whites that theGOPwas not their party and never actually cared about them.Trump‚Äôs later years as president, showed conservative Whites that 1) there was aDeep State(FBI, CIA, etc. working toward their own goals and survival) and 2) it hated us.Now, Trump legal efforts (if he pushes it) will show conservative Whites thatelectionsare rigged and thecourtsdon‚Äôt care.Without meaning to do it, Trump has ripped the mask off the establishment‚Äôs hatred for conservative Whites, which has led to millions of Whites losing confidence in the system.Not bad.

                Enough in fact to lie to the President face about troop withdrawals.Tim PoolWhile the behavior is outright seditious IMO , I do understand it. Even pre Covid the US economy was in free fall and there really isn‚Äôt much of a way to make a living.Now these guys have pensions but our ‚Äúelite‚Äù have a terrible entitlement complex and think they ought to be upper class not middle.The rest of the economy is fracked beyond repair as well, no one getting married, very few kids born and no solution to any problems the nation is facing.The Swamp and friends will loot everything they can but its not going to help. The US will fall deeper into disrepair.Honestly the best and worse thing that can happen to the US right now are the same, civil war.

            I don‚Äôt think it was inadvertent at all.  He demonstrated a mastery of moving the system in his preferred direction, in the face of organized, concerted, and powerful institutional resistance.  All without much help.  He rallied public opinion to support his efforts, including people one would never expect to fall in line behind him.  He did it his way.But, yeah, it appeared chaotic.  His NYC in-your-face and double-down style hurt a bunch of people‚Äôs feewings, which gave his opponents the excuse to elevate mundane policy differences to life-or-death battles, and to paint his behavior as evidence of both specifically the reincarnation of Hitler, and more generally of someone fundamentally unhinged.  I don‚Äôt buy any of that, and I believe quite a few other people don‚Äôt buy it either.

            A tasty white pill for y‚Äôall.Rueters/Ipsos reports,source,young White Millennial men now favor Republicans 11 points.This is BTW a nearly  unprecedented 23 point switch from 12 points favored Democrat.It means the Sailor Solution is becoming true, Republicans White, Democrats POC.The article blame  identity politics which is true but aging also plays a roll (older Gen Y are almost 40 now) and urban flight.

        The thing with Jared Taylor, Derbyshire, Buchanan, and the like is they‚Äôre ancient. Buchanan and Derb are past that point where even looks are a reliable indicator of age. I‚Äôve noticed as I hit my sixties and coming upon 70 that, despite a concerted effort to maintain mental and physical acuity, I began to hold a disdain for change. Some times I long for the ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù days when I just came of age and it was all sunshine, bunnies, and unicorn farts. No, in reality coming of age for me was the military, swamps, and jungles. Then Ranger school, then special forces selection (didn‚Äôt make it), then the ‚Äò80s and all sorts of swampy adventures under Reagan.I think as men become geriatrics there‚Äôs a cognitive degenerative process that tries to frame your reality to be comforting. It‚Äôs hard to counter it.

            Respect. Esp. for the special forces attempt back when they were truly hard corps special.
There‚Äôs a fair amount of longitudinal studies that show men‚Äôs overall happiness declines steadily from 20-50, then for most men, the trend turns around and they become happier and more content over time up until their 70‚Äôs. At which point, it can go either way.
(Good broad discussion for curious old farts here:https://arthurbrooks.com/article/your-professional-decline-is-coming-much-sooner-than-you-think-2/)
Something I remind myself when I hear Buchanan, the Derb, and Taylor who seem pretty content even when their topics are bleak. They‚Äôre following a perfectly normal life arc.

            I have read Buchanan every week for decades but now it is too hard to see the old boy phoning it in and acting like it is the conservative/liberal framework of 1985 still.
Even with Jared Taylor‚Äôs dense takes on politics it is obvious younger men need to lead the battle. The older dissidents have done heroic work but keep them under advisement.

                A couple months ago Taylor had a one-off guest cohost on the AR podcast, a younger righty who‚Äôs more up on things, who tried to lead into a riff on the crowd of Ivy Leaguers, NGO lawyers, politicians‚Äô kids, etc., who were arrested along with the stereotypical homeless tranny tweakers during the antifa riots. Taylor wouldn‚Äôt hear of it. Only ‚Äúlosers‚Äù‚Äîthroughgoing bad-family bad-genes born losers‚Äîcould possibly be involved.It‚Äôs easy to forget Taylor‚Äôs not a dissident or outsider or extremist or whatever, since almost everything he says is forbidden. He‚Äôs just an old conservative who never changed‚Äîa personification of old-conservatism, in strength and weakness alike.He‚Äôll probably ironically outlive us.

                    Amren‚Äôs been featuring various ‚ÄúHow I Became a Race Realist‚Äù posts each week, and almost all of them are from non-Whites. The other week he featured the guy who used to comment around the web as ‚ÄúJewamongyou,‚Äù a dark-skinned Sephardic Jew in America who, per Amren, ‚Äúproudly‚Äù identifies as a Jew.  My very brief comment, without any slurs or curses, asking why, in that case, he didn‚Äôt go live in Israel among his own people, was banned.  Amren‚Äôs commenters increasingly identify as ‚Äònon-racist.‚Äù  I no longer share all the ‚Äòrespect‚Äô for Taylor.

                        AmRen banned me from commenting there when some whiney white asshat wrote an article about his unhappy relationship with a black woman seeking advice on how to get out of that relationship. I suggested suicide. So I got the boot. Fine. They can do without my patronage. Greg Hood was easily the best writer there and I can read him at Unz. Jared Taylor is not the kind of guy we will need in the coming fight. It‚Äôs going to get vicious. Gentlemen are not going to cut it.

        When you mentioned Trump saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to look into assault weapons‚Äù I was reminded of an amusing response from a former colleague. We had just been talking about firearms in England, and then he brought up the ‚Äòassault weapons‚Äô thing (he was one of those that had to slam Trump and the US given any chance)‚Ä¶Says he:Assault weapons are stupid. The Americans think they need them for home defence. But with an assault rifle you may fire and hit your target, but with the trigger depressed constantly, the recoil may drive your aim up into the ceiling and the bullets could hit your sleeping wife.Of course, the exact words escape me. But this is pretty much what he said. I asked him if he thought responsible gun owners with appropriate training could stop this event from happening‚Ä¶Says he:Why do you need guns anyway?I know very little about guns. But this man seemed to ‚Äòknow‚Äô an awful lot which brings me onto the conditioning you mention Z Man: when it comes to guns, many in the UK have been primed to hate them. And we already have severe restrictions on them. Next it‚Äôll be knives then the cheese grater and finally the salad bowl.

            This is where some history on ‚Äúshall not be infringed‚Äù regulations is helpful.  Prior to the 1934 National Firearms Act, everyday people (particularly vets) owned untaxed/unregulated machine guns ‚Ä¶ there were no reported incidents of any sleeping wives being shot.

                Heavens, it is all so embarrassing. It seems to stem from the need to ‚Äòdo something‚Äô. If it ain‚Äôt guns, it‚Äôs knives. Not knives it‚Äôs pencils.At primary school (I count myself just about old enough to have avoided the dire feminization of the last 20 years), we all used to wrestle on the playing field. It was great fun. Furthermore, a handful of us use to have mock ‚Äòknife fights‚Äô with lead pencils ‚Äì stabbing at the arms and legs. Like I say‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll come for the pencils soon!One lad migrated to the Parker ball-point pen. He liked giving a slight jab under the armpit with it ‚Äì effective is all I can say.

                    I‚Äôll post in it‚Äôs entirety something I wrote on a different site some of us here are also on.Eventually I‚Äôm sure everyone, not just police, will be wearing personal bodycams at all times anywhere there are likely to be interactions with other hominids. Think of it as the logical extension of social distancing but not because people might give you an imaginary virus. It will be just because you need to have them on film when they start acting like total shits, perhaps because they‚Äôre social distancing fanatics and are incensed that you violated their 6‚Ä≤ bubble. It‚Äôs the endgame of forced diversity combined with universal snowflakeism and entitlement I suppose. Universal surveillance becomes the counter for the near-universal shitheadedness of vibrants, wammen, mask police (both official and self-appointed), and all the other easily enraged vermin you are forced to deal with.In this utopia everyone will be able to livestream their interactions with everyone else just to make sure they get their side of every encounter up on YouTube as fast as possible. Eventually every 60 seconds of inter-human interactions will result in several man-years of legal action, video and audio analysis, and of course testimony from medical and ballistics experts when the situation inevitably turns into a violent bloodbath.Next step of course is the personal mobile armored body casing that incorporates air filtration, cameras, motion sensors, listening devices, manipulator arms‚Ä¶ Basically everyone will become a Dalek and all human interactions will finally cease.It sounds like England may be 2/3 of the way there with the US at 1/2 and galloping to catch up.  For those occasional times it‚Äôs necessary to leave the suit, a padded and sterilized room will be available.  There will be a few sheets of paper (with lamination on the edges to prevent paper cuts) and crayons for writing and coloring‚Ä¶

                        It‚Äôs been said that if God didn‚Äôt exist, man would have to invent him. It used to be that people were mocked as dumb and superstitious for believing that an invisible man in the sky was watching their every move, so they should be on their best behavior. Since that belief has been mocked out of existence, people don‚Äôt behave anymore, so now we need cameras everywhere. It appears that religious belief really cuts down on the need to buy surveillance equipment.

                            Very true. It‚Äôs a hallmark of Western man that he monitors himself through ‚Äúguilt‚Äù culture, which is distinct from the ‚Äúshame‚Äù culture of the Orient, which says ‚Äòdon‚Äôt get caught.‚Äô
Western civilization is the only one that has risen to this height but it looks like it‚Äôs giving way in favor of a primitive ‚Äúpower‚Äù culture where neither shame nor guilt are strong but instead the ethic is ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be insignificant if you get caught.‚Äô

                    Don‚Äôt be embarassed. Almost nothing is worse than being governed by Mayor Lightfoot. Except being governed by Gov. Pritzker. And protectd by AG Foxx.
Although I am secure in the knowledge that it will all grow much worse.

                        Crikey. I see what you mean, this extract from Wikipedia had me in stitches:
Lightfoot is the first openly lesbian African-American woman to be elected mayor of a major city in theUnited States. She is thefirst openly LGBT person, the first African-American woman, the second woman (afterJane Byrne), and the third African-American‚ÄîafterHarold WashingtonandEugene Sawyer‚Äîto bemayor of Chicago.


They give awards for anything! I do feel for you, old son. These are the only qualifications this kneegress has.

                    Having accidently inhaled and choked on a miniature plastic Oscar Meyer Wiener Mobile whistle as a small kid, and being saved because I swung upside down on the cannon I‚Äôd been playing on and landed on all fours, thus compressing my lungs on impact and expelling said Wiener Mobile to ‚Ä¶ a whistle ‚Ä¶ I must say that I am somewhat empathetic to banning chocolate coated small toys. I‚Äôd hafta learn more about Kinder Eggs and the default is not to ban before I cast my chocolaty opinion. Are the toys cool?

                That‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt do what we can‚Äôt do, which is to discuss the reason these weapons are such a big problem.  Brits could buy drain cleaner for as long its been around.  The biggest problem with drain cleaner was accidental exposure.  But now, people who come from lands without plumbing use it a weapon.America doesn‚Äôt have a gun problem and Britain doesn‚Äôt have a knife or acid problem. We both have an African, Mestizo and Pakistani problem.  White America‚Äôs homicide rate is about the same as in Europe.  Strip out blacks and latinos and we look just like the lands we came from.  The only thing making Baltimore a 2nd world city and not an African city is the whites that are left and the surrounding counties and state.  That is all that keeps Philadelphia running at all as well.

            These arguments pull you into the weeds. Don‚Äôt go there.
The Founding Fathers wanted the government to afraid of the people, not the other way around. The best way to do that was to have an armed citizenry that could band together and threaten rebellion.
Assault rifles are exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind.

            Idiot is talking about muzzle climb.  It‚Äôs where each little kick of recoil pushes the weapon up a bit on yourfully automaticweapon.  Those are actually still (sort of) legal here but they won‚Äôt let us make any new ones and the remainder of the registered legal ones are getting expensive, like $50,000 and up.  What most gun control nutters think is an assault weapon is just a semi-auto like the notorious AR-15.  They look a lot like the US Army‚Äôs M4A1, which can switch to full auto mode using a selector switch.This kind of sloppy misidentification and misunderstanding of weapons is chronic here in our libtard population.  The term ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù itself was invented by them to demonize the most popular rifle type in the country.  Inventing neologisms is a standard propaganda technique wherein a relatively neutral term, say ‚Äúhandgun‚Äù or ‚Äúpistol‚Äù is replaced by something with negative or suspect emotional connotations such as ‚ÄúSaturday Night Special‚Äù.  They tried that back in the 1970s and 1980s to associate cheap revolvers with the epidemic of black crime.  It was clever as it repurposed legitimate racism to mainly disarm poorer whites.  You seldom hear this term anymore.  The Left is, after all,progressiveyou know.

                Well, remembering my past training in using fully auto hand held weapons, we were taught to control muzzle rise.  Indeed, that was the purpose of the exercises.  Now at a certain point, say some big bruiser, .308 or better, you‚Äôd have a hard time.  But in those cases you fire in short bursts so as not to lose control.  Heck, you fire in bursts most all the time.  Empty magazines present a problem all of their own.  üòâ

            You may know little but your friend knows less.‚ÄúAssault Weapons‚Äù are, as he says, fully automatic. They require a special license which is very difficult to obtain. I am not aware of an unlawful killing with an ‚ÄúAssault Weapon‚Äù fire on full auto  in the US but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs been one. What the dipshit liberals in the US call assault weapons are no such thing, They refer typically to AR15‚Äôs and similar which, like most modern rifles are semi-automatic. One pull of the trigger fires one shot and ejects and reloads ready for the next.Some share some outward appearances with some automatics (bayonet attachments seem to particularly terrify).You might mention that four times as many people in the US are murdered with knives as with long guns.

                Assault weapons are difficult *and* expensive to obtain. Thanks to Reagan, an M16 will set you back $30-40K to legally register and own one‚Äîyour State permitting such ownership.  The ubiquitous H&amp;K MP5‚Äìused in all those TV shows and bad guy movies, $40K+.  The official registry for fully auto weapons allowed in civilian ownership is something like 200k+ (IIRC).  A drop in the bucket given the millions and millions of semi-auto‚Äôs in use.

            The only particular use I can think of for fully automatic fire (to which your interlocutor appears to have been alluding) is to provide suppressive cover for an advance on hardened positions (or to defend against same). The vast majority of ‚Äúassault rifles‚Äù in the hands of law abiding US citizens is semi-automatic, meaning the round will fire, eject and the next one will load with pulling the trigger, but keeping the trigger depressed will not cause the next round to fire. To own a fully auto (legally) requires a lot of additional red tape and taxes, so few own them (legally).Plus, with civies having to pay for their own ammo, fully auto fire can get expensive quickly.

            Anyone who lives near London has to understand.  As a denizen of Lagos on the Delaware, people around here instinctively understand the need for firearms.To be honest, I always thought gun control was about blacks, that the Democrats living in these urban warzones didn‚Äôt want the natives to have guns.  But even if that was once true, the justification has drifted to ‚Äúwe hate the people who love guns!‚ÄùThat is what gun control is all about.  The rural white absolutely loves guns. That is all they need to know about guns.  They hate guns for the same reason we hate tofu.

        An easy way to mock the system is to be healthy and vigorous while walking into a store without a mask and tell everyone who challenges you that you can‚Äôt wear a mask because of a health condition.If you think saying you have a health condition is a lie, remember that the powers in charge consider racism a public health crisis.

                I look at more as regrouping rather than retreat‚Ä¶You have to actually have an organization before you can retreat which we don‚Äôt have at the moment‚Ä¶We really are going to need one another for what is coming so why not be grouping up now and build those Communities while things are still held together by a thread‚Ä¶One day that door is going to be shut and then you are going to have to make do with where you are at and with those around you and if it‚Äôs sketchy then your chance at survival will on the lower end of the scale‚Ä¶

                    Everyone is in a really fragile place right now, including us.  Think about it, twenty five years ago, there was no broadly operating internet.  It was all telephone, paper, face-to-face.  Now, everyone‚Äôs lives and well being, including ours, depends on the net.  That is a whole new layer of fragility, both because we need that system to be functional for us to operate, and because everyone‚Äôs ability to function away from the net, IRL, has withered.I suspect the day we are all screwed is when TPTB simply switch off the internet.  We won‚Äôt know what is going on, we will have trouble communicating, and all the supply channels and commerce fails.I think this is the plan, as they are letting way too much stay posted up, like all of this voting fraud knowledge.  They could block it, but they don‚Äôt.  Why?  Because it sucks us in, keeps us wired into the net, so that when they pull the plug, we are well and truly screwed.  So we know a lot, they don‚Äôt care.  When the system shuts down, superior knowledge about what is going on is worth bupkis.  Instead it is a matter of survival IRL.  Our hyper focus on the net, and the way it makes us more fragile, is worth having a bit of knowledge contrary to the best interests of TPTB posted up, in their eyes.

            First let me say that I have negative sympathy for blacks; even if they were aware that their actions made their situation worse they would still be for it so long as it made it worse for whites too.  With that being said‚Ä¶A lot of what destroyed what communities did so to black communities as well.  Instead of the black guy who owns the local gas station it‚Äôs some weird foreigner working a grift, and not that there are blacks to start gas stations since the ‚Äútalented tenth‚Äù is constantly stripped away to serve as trophies at Good White companies.I‚Äôm all for giving them their own place, but they would have standing to say that the tools they need to properly form a working community have been stolen from them.  Perhaps we can come to an agreement where they can take everything that Jeff Bezos and his ex-wife own to start their New Wakanda.

        it will be interesting to see where the anti-prog anger goes, over the next year.   even when Trump is sworn in for his second term, there is residual anger, and lots of it.   I see sports taking it in the ass (even more so), as well as woke entertainment.   Fox is already in a death spiral.

                        Whether there was voter fraud or not, Trump has convinced normie cons that there was. In fact normie cons are now tied at the hip with Trump.
When the Republican state legislatures ultimately do not appoint Republican electors, the normiecons will see it as the Republicans selling out Trump and failing to stand up for them, *whether or not* there was actually fraud!
Its genius, the GOP will be destroyed. No more donations and they will have no voters. He‚Äôs doing what we here at Z always said must be done.

            Agreed, here. Knowing myself, it may be due to the perceived threat ‚Äî a great motivator that has a past track record with similar outcomes.Another reason may be the reduction of distractions and opportunities for them. The hallmark of the Trump era has been the knowing. Also, with the government actions, a term I prefer instead of ‚Äòdue to covid‚Äô as the latter is passive and lacks accountability, distractions, costs and behaviors have been reduced, modified and eliminated outright.Look, two states respond to covid differently. One locks down hard. One does not. So is your business going under in one state, while remaining in existence in another ‚Äòbecause of covid?‚Äô No, that‚Äôs the childish, stupid low-brow rationale we have come to expect from the 3rd grade teachers in government.Before heading further into tl;dr land‚Ä¶ my time above ground no longer includes the following:&gt;&gt; going to restaurants (at least twice a week, plus business lunches 2-3 times a week)&gt;&gt; consuming ANY sportsball&gt;&gt; consuming ANY TV programming&gt;&gt; Interacting with the stupider/liberal people in my life that I do not have to deal with in business&gt;&gt; Attending church services&gt;&gt; Watching the stock market, I cashed out when I could lock in gains and never looked back at that time suckMost here know the saying about God ‚Äòclosing a door, opening a window‚Äô so here is what has been added, in the vacuum of deleting the above:&gt;&gt; Home cooking/baking 95% of all food consumed, from scratch&gt;&gt; Completing one longstanding project after another, home improvements, etc. ‚Äî- not trivial, talking BIG projects that bring real quality of life enhancements and property value increase&gt;&gt; More time for people worth my time, that bring something to my life, including an improvement on an already great marriage relationship through sharing the projects&gt;&gt; Adding a new personal sport that I share with two of my adult children, is not affected by covid lockdowns whatsoever&gt;&gt; Added a hobby, also shared&gt;&gt; Tons more done at work in my role as business owner&gt;&gt; A massive increase in learning and skills acquisition&gt;&gt; Personal religious growth and moral support of others in my circle

                Arcadian,Bravo to you and the others. I often sense my enthusiasm and unbounded faith in Our People on this site annoys and irritates some. It doesn‚Äôt stem from naivete. Things are off kilter in this world and dark days are ahead. So what? We will abide and eventually thrive. If ever there was a race astride this earth that could adapt to adversity and create improvements in the interim; it is Our People. Other groups shellac their failings in long past real or imagined wrongs. Lay in the swill of failure and despair pointing accusatory fingers at those daring to walk out of the muck.Enough allusion. In short. Thanks to you Sir, and the others for posting about your resilience. It made my morning a happy one. My unbounded faith in Us is an article of faith for me. Thank you, many times over.

                Also, with the government actions, a term I prefer instead of ‚Äòdue to covid‚Äô as the latter is passive and lacks accountability, distractions, costs and behaviors have been reduced, modified and eliminated outright.As soon as this madness began in the Spring I noted that the perpetrators had already gotten all the news and corporate mouthpieces using the same terminology about it.  Everything was ‚Äúbecause of Covid‚Äù.  This is clearly a coordinated propaganda effort that was in motion at the very beginning.It was obvious to me that people were losing jobs and businesses were failing, not because of the silly virus, but due to the outrageous rules and shutdowns imposedpolitically.  Even today, I still hear well meaning people using the ‚Äúbecause of Covid‚Äù language.  I don‚Äôt understand why the Right, including the DR for the most part, doesn‚Äôt grasp the need to start the resistance to tyranny by resisting the tyrant‚Äôslanguage.From the beginning I used the phrase ‚Äúbecause of the Covid hysteria‚Äù with people on the DR and milder versions like ‚Äúbecause of the Covid panic/reaction‚Äù with normies.  To my recollection, INEVERslipped up and used the enemy‚Äôs terminology.  No one in my circle ever ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù me about this.  Now this could be due to the fact that I don‚Äôt work as any sort of corporate mouthpiece and those who know me are aware of what a combative dick I am too.  I‚Äôm sure that if people who opposed the Covid madness had used the same linguistic warfare discipline as I did there would have been numerous ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù delivered to them ‚Äì and that would have started a fight ‚Äì and that would have been a very healthy thing.There‚Äôs a thread here pounding on the gun topic of course.  Maybe I‚Äôll chime in there too if I have time later.  The thing is, if more people would refuse the language of the oppressors, consistently and right at the start of their little ‚Äúinitiatives‚Äù, we might not be at the point where we need to think about shooting it out with our enemies.  Modern warfare is carried out on many levels, political, legal, linguistic/propaganda, and yes, militarily and paramilitarily.  Our enemies rank and file may be stupid and functionally illiterate but their leaders seem to grasp this intuitively.  We largely do not, either at the level of opinion leaders or rank and file.  It‚Äôs always ‚Äúguns are the whole thing, we don‚Äôt need no steenking politics‚Äù or contrarily ‚Äúguns are nothing, it should all be political actions/ethnic organization‚Äù.Look at the UK, for instance.  The gun laws there are ridiculous so the Brits are just slightly fucked in my opinion.  Ultimately, they‚Äôve got no credible violent ultimatums they can deliver to the political class.  At the same time, they seem to have been out in force lately making a lot of noise about Boris‚Äô latest lockdown.  Americans, by contrast, have much greater access to guns and a lot more of us are skilled in their use and care.  American right wing white peoplearea credible threat to the ruling class ‚Äì but where are the protests?  I can‚Äôt find them.  Where I live (Oregon) there is outrightfuryonline even on FB at our communist degenerate tyrant governor.  There have been a few marches in Salem about the lockdowns and it looks like, finally, people may have reached their limit with Brown‚Äôs latest royal edict.It‚Äôs not just that.  I, personally, using my own real name and my more moderate online persona of civnat MAGAtard, have been trying to organize events like target shooting meets and other vaguely Trump adjacent stuff.  No one responds and the few people who sign up won‚Äôt show up.  Then there‚Äôs the legal angle.  Where have the lawyers been?  It‚Äôs not like there are no attorneys on the Right.  Hell, even old school civil libertarian ACLU types should have been all over this shit from day one.

            Same. I got incredibly lucky- I joined the army and shipped out right at the start of the year. Instead of college, I‚Äôve been saving money and I‚Äôm now richer than I‚Äôve ever been, in better shape, and am completely covered on rent, food, electricity, water, and healthcare. This has honestly been one of the best years of my life.

        Agreed about the minority envy stuff. I live in an extremely minority heavy area. They love us but hate us at the same time. What they really want is to be white ‚Äì and if not, then they want to get rid of us.They hate seeing happy white people, they hate seeing white people with families. They hate that they are not able to recreate our personality types.Ironically they become more out of place as their numbers grow ‚Äì it‚Äôs basically impossible for their kids to assimilate any kind of whiteness when they‚Äôre in a 70% coloured area ‚Äì and this just fuels the resentment even more.

            One aspect of that ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù unicorn is that our families and kids don‚Äôt need to spend all day cogitating about their skin color.  So the powers-that-be are going to force us to do so.  Since minority families are stuck in a mental box trying to reconcile their color with the ideal of being a white family, it all needs to be flipped so that we must fret over it as well.  Then there are those who accrue wealth and power by stirring that pot, all day every day‚Ä¶

                Yes, they are extremely self aware about their race. They try to do the same to us. It doesn‚Äôt really work on a well grounded white person, especially who grew up in a whiter area and have good family, social, or religious connections. Sadly for kids growing up in coloured areas they seem less confident and try to be ghetto.
Just like the Karen‚Äôs, the browns just want to be validated and feel legitimate. I never give them anything, and generally cut right through their bullshit.

            Funny thing about our relationship to our black tenants. It sometimes really feels like the ‚Äúlord‚Äù in landlord. The wife handles the rent collection, and most of the tenants call her ‚ÄúMiss Vizzini‚Äù like a lady of the plantation.
They get angry at her sometimes when she lays down the law, but the anger is impotent, because they know they need her, that they can‚Äôt do something as simple as own and maintain a home on their own.

            This was always something that I found odd about our UK laws. We have a restriction on many types of firearms, but bolt action rifles are legal. Something that permits a skilled marksman to dispatch an entity at range.

                Of course I cannot speak for all countries. But from some I‚Äôve lived in or visited I know that Western European countries typically strictly restrict handguns. But rifles and similar long guns are legal for the citizens to own. I‚Äôm not a gun nut, but Common Sense tells me that any rifle capable of killing a medium to large animal is equally capable of killing a human.

            I‚Äôm well past explaining anything to these types. If its not guns its something else that they use to elevate themselves above you and the rest of us dirt people. That‚Äôs all it is to these people. Constant self-assurance that they are more evolved, that the reside across the great divide on the right side of history and all that.It has nothing to do with actual ‚ÄúConstitutional Law‚Äù or any other well-reasoned argument. They presume that we need to justify ourselves and our choices because that‚Äôs how they exist. They are prisoners, trapped by their own need for constant approval from extrinsic sources and fiat authorities made up of people just like them.It is all about status. They question those who possess self-assurance and self-determination because they are only able to extract their worth from compliance and submission. Its not just the guns but its your defiance that makes them uncomfortable.Thus I find the best approach to these feminine challenges is to just indict their (lack of) manhood, to reveal the fact that their status as a male is in a constant state of submissive and permissive compliance to other men.In essence, ‚ÄúI own guns because it is my god given duty as a man to protect my family and community. If you want to outsource your duty as a man to some other man employed by the State, well that‚Äôs your right. A lot of males outsource their duties these days so I am sure you have a lot of company.‚ÄùSurprisingly, many of the honest ones will own up to this. Debating the esoteric constitutional origins or practical mechanics of various weaponry is always a waste of time. Its always a personal feeling to them anyhow. Might as well hit that nail straight away.

            I have such a beast. After prolonged usage, I fear the first man it will kill will be me but perhaps not, who can afford to go down to the range and put a hundred rounds through a 308 or creedmore  nowadays.I like to tell them the concept was that in WWI (the war to end all wars- how‚Äôs that workin for ya?) it was deemed better to kill a horse loaded with ammo crates at 1000 yards than try to kill a sniper in a trench at 400.  Their little PETA tears are a joy to watch.

                I can guarantee there are few experiences finer than the ability to scoot, shoot, and hit a man sized target consistently at 300+ yards with an assault rifle.  At that range a human figure is pretty small and seems remote.  That‚Äôs just the distance I‚Äôd like to be away if he‚Äôs carrying a rifle.  At my age, I have to hump with an ACOG scope, but those seem standard now in the sand box with 20 yo‚Äôs, so fine.

            The thing about the left is they love telling people all about things they truly do not understand. I have noticed this does not exist nearly as much on the right, especially ‚Äúthis‚Äù right. I admit to the things I do not understand and try not to get caught in discussions on those issues. If I do, I just listen or try to frame it in a way where I can contribute based on a philosophical/ideological frame work. Or ask questions purely out of curiosity and a need to learn. I‚Äôm old enough that this should not surprise me and yet it continues to do so. I pretended to know everything when I was in high school, so I guess its further proof of the arrested development of the vaunted intellects we are dealing with.

        Prompted by your comment about Baltimore streets being like driving over the surface of the moon, I just spent a few minutes looking at Google Street View images of the neighborhoods just to the east Johns Hopkins. I was not surprised to find you were not exaggerating, but the quality of the housing on some streets was even worse than I was anticipating. This seems a like possibility to help some normies make it across the river. Suggest they look at these images of Baltimore or Detroit and think about why these places look that way.

            In Northern Virginia with ~2 million people, deaths with Covid ‚Äì not from Covid but with Covid ‚Äì have been averaging about one per day since July. More recently, it‚Äôs less than one per day.
So, ~300 people a year would die with Covid (so maybe it accelerated their deaths slightly) out of 2 million or 0.015% of the population or 1 out of ~7,500 people.
For this, we impose lock downs. The word madness doesn‚Äôt do this justice.

                    Yeah, CDC excess death numbers show the virus doing exactly what you‚Äôd expect: slowly burning out.
It would burned out quickly but the lock downs slowed it down, but the path is the same. The vaccines ‚Äì assuming they even work ‚Äì will ‚Äústop‚Äù a virus that was already nearly done.

                                There‚Äôs the religion angle too.  I think the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses or maybe it was the Adventists who are against vaccines and get a pass on vaccination.  If there isn‚Äôt a religion that forbids Beer flu vaccines I‚Äôll invent one myself. Maybe I‚Äôll become the L. Ron Hubbard of the Church of Vaccinology.

Here in Ontario only the shitlib Toronto, and brown/asian suburbs are locked down. They seem to be harming their own base the most.

                        It‚Äôs a good question. I can think of at least a few plausible answers. First, lockdowns concentrate economic power in Leftist corporations at the expense of small businesses, which cannot withstand the long-term loss of revenue. Second, government accrues new and hitherto unthinkable‚Äìexcept in totalitarian states‚Äìpowers, which they will not relinquish once the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù is declared over. Third, in forcing the masses to wear Karen Kloths, and engage in other idiotic behaviors, they habituate people to the life of livestock, which is exactly how the Power Structure views them.

                        The plan is to destroy any independent small operators (colloquially, mom and pop businesses).  By consolidating and conglomerating, control over the economy becomes that much easier, and the populace that more dependent on government edicts (permission).  Easier to deal with one Bezos or Fuckerberg who own 90% of the market than a million of them running around out there sharing that 90% more equally.

            It is better to examine the age cohorts that represent the world population.  You can google such.  The world population increases more to sharply reduced death rates as opposed to sharply increasing birth rates.  African of course is a head case, but everyone else is slated to drop in population shortly as the oldsters die off.  Last prediction I saw was a leveling and decline at 9B+.

                To imagine something I am entirely certain has been imagined by tptb: suppose the next 10,000 demonstration is by armed people and someone in authority points out that the entire city is filled with their mortal enemies who plan to enslave them. Then he says, ‚ÄúAt them!‚Äù
I can imagine it because the veneer of civilization is so thin and something like this has happened so many times in the past. It is a terrifying thought.

            CMA has always been a joke, but it is amusing see them embrace being the teller and punchline, all-in-one. It‚Äôs like the occultist symbol of the wyvern swallowing it‚Äôs own tail. I mean, the symbology here could mean the music will cycle back to white trash standards, but in the meantime it‚Äôs just eating own ass.

            Country radio is destroyed lol. It‚Äôs like R&amp;B with southern accents. Nobody actually likes this crap ‚Äì but then again their main goal is cultural destruction, not making a profit.
Some radio stations have been adding more classics and 00s country into the mix which leads to improved ratings.

                Yup, our ‚Äúcountry‚Äù station started subscribing to a ‚Äúcountry ‚Äò90s‚Äù feed on the weekends.  That stuff was never the real deal either, but it is so head-and-shoulders above the dreck that country radio is spitting out today.  The difference is startling, to say nothing of being reminded  that the ‚Äò90s was 20 to 30 years ago now.

        I‚Äôll see your commentary on Baltimore and raise you Detroit.For a couple generations now, it has been majority black, and for at least 20-30 years 80%+ black.  Now they are intentionally creating urban prairies in place of where the civilization used to be.And to your point, the only development and investment is from white businessmen who still believe, or at least want to believe, they can rebuild the city ‚Äì the Ilitch Family (Little Caesars, Red Wings, Tigers), Dan Gilbert (Quicken Loans), Ford, and GM.What is funny is that after a few generations of this, and 40 years of black mayors, the blacks actually elected a white mayor a few years back, something I never thought I would see in my lifetime.  Maybe they have learned from their experience.

            Years ago when I had a real job, I was asked to transfer to the Detroit office. They sent me out to meet with the person who would be my new boss if I accepted the transfer. I was in Boston at the time, so flew out in the morning and planned to return in the evening. The boss had an emergency, so we only spoke for an hour, so I had the day to kill. I drove around Detroit.I came upon a scene that was from a sci-fi movie. There was a stripped car in the middle of the intersection. the building were all collapsing. One had trees growing in the roof. This is something I learned was not uncommon. The dirt on the roof piled up and birds dropped seeds in the dirt. Voila! A roof forest.I passed on the ‚Äúopportunity.‚Äù

                    Exactly this. Rome lost 99% of its population after the fall of the Western Empire dropping from roughly one million to ten thousand.Michigan has better soil so it will probably drop to twenty thousand if it goes full agriculture or to maybe two hundred thousand if the US can manage simple industry.

        Trump might have been the savior but for the unprecedented hatred driven by the elite. Half of the electorate being emotion driven ignorant cat ladies and degenerates made it easy.   The fact that this election has been obviously stolen has lit a fuse on a very large powder keg. Those who have seen the elephant have a pretty good idea what to do. No one wanted what is now inevitable.  Living under criminal rule is not acceptable. I do not expect to see the other side.

        Looks like GOP is throwing away the GA election, fake audits fake recounts. Rushing to certify by 5pm tommorow. Snakes all around, the GOP must be destroyed. Traitors are worse than enemies.

As an aside, can anyone else immediately tell a traitor apart? I take one look at Brian Kemp and I can immediately tell he‚Äôs a fraud; a liar. Same with the GA SOS and other GA Republicans. I just instinctively know they‚Äôre crooked.

He also knows better than to trust these slugs.So long as he gets seated and he keeps the Senate sure some people will skate. Oh well.Ultimately it is as I always say about buying time. Its going to be on us to come up with an ideology, promote it til critical mass than shove it down as many throats as it takes till we get our Hallmark World.

        The institutions of ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù society are simply part of the AWR Power Structure, which is the only power structure. There is no replacing them without formally abolishing the nation and startingde novo. Far more feasible for those who oppose the Power Structure is to separate. To form a breakaway nation.

        Broadly speaking, there are two archetypal paths forward. First is, we try to community organize our way to a majority consensus that may enable a peaceful separation. Second is, tangibly fight back now against the creeping cancer of tyranny that will inevitably arise now that the rule of law is dead and politics is anything goes (including rigging elections).What does history tell us? During the First Civil War, the South tried to separate peacefully and over 600,000 soldiers died during 4 years of hot war. In the Balkans, disparate ‚Äúpeoples‚Äù have been at each others throats for centuries and the body count is unmeasurable. There has to be a better solution than killing untold numbers of peons at the bottom of both social pyramids.

        Increasingly, the question on people‚Äôs minds will not be ‚Äúhow do we save them?‚Äù, but ‚Äúhow to we replace them?‚Äù
We need a great overall pithy branding shorthand like Pro-Choice/Pro-Life was. Where it made either side sensible and righteous.

        You really need to go back to reading the news, because there‚Äôs no way, in the face of the mounting evidence, that Trump won‚Äôt be able to prove fraud in this election, oh ye of little faith.And I think that‚Äôs the root of the issue- your perspective lacks a supernatural sense. This struggle is not between mere men, but between the forces of Heaven and the forces of Hell. The demons will only be cast out through the Light of Christ.You‚Äôre a smart guy, but no one can come to the right conclusions with incomplete information. Try going to church sometime, try studying the Bible. Once you realize the Great Divide is actually the Great Divorce (C.S Lewis‚Äô term for the rift between heaven and hell) politics make a lot more sense.

            I sincerely hope you‚Äôre right, but hope alone won‚Äôt save us if the Democrats succeed in stealing this election. Yes, I agree that the overwhelming evidence of voter fraud should be enough to turn back the tide of criminality sweeping over the country; and in a perfect world, the Judiciary would assert itself and say . . . NO, not here, not now, and not ever. The rule of God may remain intact, but men are fallible and virtually every branch of our Federal Government is infested with treasonous men who would betray their honor in a heartbeat when the right bribe is offered. They may later burn in Hell, but in the present, they can, and likely will, do unmitigated harm to this country and it‚Äôs people.

This is already the case in Medicine and IT.We are utterly expendable.We need attrition economic warfare upon them Not funny jokes but global cultural judo of anti consumption for the planet.Globohomo runs on cheap stuff from China.

            China fights war, and has interests, in a way we understand- so your premise that a war with China might cleanse the dross makes more and more sense.


I told a Taiwanese lieutenant, spying in Boston, that the great fear is when the War comes between the Yellow and the White. He agreed.


The best resolution? If China takes the Mideast in their own Pikes-Sycot moment. That might exactly what this battered world needs.

Give them the Global South, the One Belt, and let us repair to and retake our Northern lands.

How, how they will miss us!

        Trump is certainly not the savior but a firewall to protect us from all out class warfare against us and the utter destruction of the U.S. I know Z hates him and considers him useless but he did do a lot like killing TPP, mass amnesty, Paris Accords, reforming NAFTA and correctly IDing China as our main enemy while smoking out the Deep State which DR could never dream of doing.That said many of the DR people want this to happen but they have no f**king clue what happens the oligarchs and Marxists take full control. They will declare war on us and there will be no one to stop them.This is not a game, this isn‚Äôt something that you can snark about with a bunch of other kool kids online because that will be gone.Even now they just deplatformed  TCTH and you can bet sites like this will be next. Look at England and Scotland the laws you see enacted over there will become the norm over here.These people are no joke and they play for keeps and the DR failure in understanding them will be their undoing.

            I agree with almost all of your post, especially the part about the DR being clueless about what is coming fast, but Z doesn‚Äôt hate Trump at all. Quite the opposite, actually. He got pissed, as did many of us, when Trump appeared to be siding with Feinstein and Company over gun control, but overall he has been generous to Trump. I have tremendous respect for Trump even though he has disappointed me at times. It took remarkable courage, and, yes, a generous dose of narcissism, to withstand the assault on him and his family.The president is the best we could do under present circumstances, but those are shifting rapidly toward us. The election fraud has really awakened Normie. I, and probably you, have had people totally out of the blue rant about the illegitimacy not just of the election but of the State. Trump‚Äôs biggest achievement has been making people question their rulers and oppressors.Win/win. We will be able to further castrate the State regardless of how the election turns out.

            A lot here are not going to like this but facts are fact. Guns you won‚Äôt use are a talisman. Might as well have a teddy bear for all the good they‚Äôll do.First thing though. Ideology, Have one, have a good one that takes into account reality and be willing to fight to impose it on others by force or you don‚Äôt have a society.You want an end to  abortion and note I don‚Äôt,  you must have enough political power to have the government (and that is you BTW) hang abortionists  and if you want a good ideology, it must take into account real behavior and consequences. A ban on eugenic abortion means more Down‚Äôs Syndrome and other malformed babies that no one wants  being sent up for adoption. Actions have consequences,Don‚Äôt like the local version of Pussy Riot or whatever Entartete Kunst the left vomits up this weak , you need to have  political power to gulag them or flog them. A good ideology understand that there will be consequences for this too.And so on.No one will give you that power and if you run from it, you create a vacuum the other guy will fill. In other words, take power or lose.Before that, feel free to exhaust all remedies (we are at about 90% there now) and try the  above broad ways . Most important is of course to actually have an ideology, a new and useful one, No looking backward , forward thinking year 2020 reality based.That is how you win, by being able to say ‚ÄúThis is who we are, here is why its better, join us.‚Äù not hoarding guns or ammo.

As abprosper says below, guns are a comfort blanket, a pacifier. They allow you to tell yourself that politics doesn‚Äôt concern you, because you always have this idea of muh militia saving the day in the back of your mind.
I‚Äôm not against gun ownership, but there‚Äôs an unhealthy cargo cult going on. The Swedes have plenty of guns, but guns are not part of the political debate, neither in the MSM or Swedish disright media.

More like ‚Äúput up or shut up.‚Äù It‚Äôs embarrassing to listen to you woof about muh guns while your country is being stolen away, and the thieves are openly gloating about how they‚Äôre going to rub out your white asses.
Guns are taking up an enormous amount of oxygen in the American political discussion and make normiecons easy to manipulate. A great number of them will vote for any Zionist war hog, as long as he promises he‚Äôll let them keep their bump locks, oppressors and high-capacity barrels.

                    You don‚Äôt know Felix Krull didn‚Äôt serve or hasn‚Äôt shot guns. Europe isn‚Äôt as gun crazy as  the USA but guns are pretty common and military service with firearms training is mandatory in some places.Now I  know how to shoot, scoot, sneak. Shot handguns and AR‚Äôs and shotguns. So I‚Äôm not gun phobic. Don‚Äôt much enjoy shooting but I‚Äôm as pro gun as a person can get,It doesn‚Äôt change jack shit.

                        The idea that you can‚Äôt have an opinion on gun culture unless you‚Äôve completed ranger training, corresponds to the SJW notion that to have a valid opinion on black people, you need to be black yourself.And I actually owned a shotgun once ‚Äì or rather a third of one. I lived on the Faroe Islands in my teens, and back then, buying one was as simple as buying a can of tuna, except you had to be sixteen. We would pester our skipper until he let us shoot puffins from the prow of the boat (or at least shoot at them.) I must have fired all of twenty shells before I dropped the gun in the sea, not having hit a single bird.My fellow gun owners were not amused.

            Point well taken.  But the call to arms (a call to violence) is never taken lightly.  Until then, one prepares and does the necessary to insure skill at arms.  That you or I feel the time is now, is not important.  The time may or may not come, but if it does, no one will stand on a street corner and declare such.  It will be organic and we will know.

                The Communists , Corporatists  Leftists , Intersectionalists are not your countrymen. They are people want you  enslaved or dead.Now sure its not a race war . What it is is Americans, mostly Whites and Friends vs Reds and AlliesI while no one would hold it against you for not wanting a war, ain‚Äôt your choice. Its going to happen whether you want it to or not.Best case scenario is Trump undoes the voter fraud and wins a second term, buying a few years of MAGA and a tiny chance for renewal.We are all praying for thisOtherwise here  is your futureFirst, you‚Äôll no longer be allowed the soap box as big tech will censor you and doxxing will make sure you don‚Äôt eat if you say or think the wrong thingSecond and as you see right now, the ballot box doesn‚Äôt work as the other side cheats and always wins.That leaves you with what ?You don‚Äôt need to answer as everyone here knows the answer already.I‚Äôm not telling you to do anything except one thing, harden your mind. Its going to be uglyIn a  very short period of time, maybe a few months or years its resist  ride the gulag train  or  maybe get a  bullet .You have a little time so get ready.A last thing, when it goes bad you will be called upon to work with others to collective goals and do horrible things. The  harder you get now, the easier it be.Be like Rafa≈Ç Gan-Ganowicz When asked about all the awful things you do shrug and say ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve only killed communists.‚ÄùYou‚Äôll sleep better at night.

                You know little about Scandinavia. Much of Scandinavia has mandatory military service. Almost anyone from Sweden and Norway has basic training, many Danes, 80% of Finns and a smattering of everyone else does as well.Felix has certainly used a shotgun although he wasn‚Äôt   a good shot as a lad.Personal firearms are very common in the religion, mostly for hunting and some target shooting.They do understand firearms quite well but what it looks like from outside is our reluctance is a paralyzing  cowardice combined with a big mouth which is beneath us.They don‚Äôt mind the lack of desire to use force only the useless threats no one will follow up upon.TL;DR ‚Äî Scandinavians do get it, the American Right needs to shut up. Threats you won‚Äôt carry out are useless. If you are willing to use force at some point, hopefully before its too late that keep you mouth shut anyway,  Its bad opsec

        Speaking of reaching the normies, can I make a technical suggestion? Do you think you could release the podcast as individual segments?
That makes it easier to send a ‚Äúhey, watch this‚Äù link to people. Non-fans and first-timers who see the clips on Twitter or YouTube are also much more likely to listen to one 10-minute segment than a whole hour-long podcast.
Also makes the content less dated: people can find old ones that seem relevant, but very few people will listen to a whole old podcast.

        Great podcast. It actually tracks with how I have come down on the election, Trump, and the future. This was the Suez Crisis for the United States.I would add one other point. The State is vicious as all hell but desperately wants to maintain the illusion of legitimacy to try to keep the Empire intact (it is dead already but hopes, spring). The foreign audience is more important in this regard than the domestic one. The United States loves the moral crusade of spreading democracy throughout the world. Granted, the nation is a totalitarian hellscape now but TPTB still think it can run its morality grift abroad. With the imperial subjects increasingly convinced the election was fraudulent, in no small part because it was, this will become a much tougher task. Further, I suspect you can nearly double the 70 million Americans who realize the election was stolen. Probably that many on the Left and in the center feel that way as well, with the former approving of it and the latter disinterested or afraid to speak out.We should all hope the State continues to believe it can fool the rubes both foreign and domestic. If it ever realizes the gig is up, there will be no brakes on its evil and fast speed rather than slow cleanse genocide will be on the table.Finally, if the Empire had simply coopted Trump, all this would have worked out fine for them. Whether it was stupidity or hubris or fear doesn‚Äôt matter, the coup attempt and subsequent vote fraud has delegitimized the State in ways we or any one else never could. Again, the best scenario is the State doesn‚Äôt figure out people know.

        Does anyone really think that the blacks are going to be able to organize a fake election of the scale that we just witnessed?  Of course not ‚Ä¶ the usual suspects organized the whole thing, starting the day after Trump won in 2016.  The black and brown poll workers were just doing what they were told to do ‚Ä¶ probably getting some $$$ for it.  They‚Äôre the equivalent of the looters.

        About a month ago, an account on Twitter appeared by ‚ÄúKlaus Shwab‚Äù WEF, a parody. I followed it when it had 10 followers. A few weeks later, it had about 2000. Basically taking the piss out of the NWO they have planned for us. Twitter suspended it then. They are very sensitive to mockery. One of our greatest weapons is graffiti, not mask refusal (which identifies you as a dissident)

            Thanks for the link.  (FYI, this Twitter thread describes some elements of the PA voting software and speculates on how it might be manipulated).  As most of it is well beyond my ken, my takeaway is to question why would a program designed to tally votes, a simple counting process, need such complexity?  My old school code writing experience tells me that a simple ten or twenty line open source program could do the job correctly, with clarity, and with security.

                Any half dozen persons here could develop a reasonably  honest voting system, or at least spec it out.  The system is the way the system is precisely because it is designed to fail.  That is to say, allow improper voting and tabulating.  I won‚Äôt elaborate further as we all know the general aspects of what‚Äôs wrong and the common sense solutions.

Now, after years of looking at non-mainstream media, and researching Cultural Marxism, feminism, equal rights, immigration, gay rights, and Zionism, among others, it always leads back to an over-representation of the usual suspects.

                Thanks for the feedback, Falcone ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve also heard this reasoning from Z about developing a negative identity.  I prefer to see this in terms of ‚Äúoppressed and oppressor‚Äù, where Blacks blame Whites for oppressing them, and Whites blame Jews for oppressing them.  But this dynamic assumes a ‚Äúsuperiority‚Äù component, which, I think, does not hold when considering the White/Jew dynamic.  I tend to hold to the Kevin MacDonald school where the Jews are consciously working together and, as such, able to over-achieve.

                Falcone, I wrote a reply to your reply but I‚Äôm getting the ‚ÄúAwaiting for approval‚Äù orange warning for that reply ‚Ä¶ it may not post like many of my other posts.   Must be because I used the wrong 3-letter word ‚Ä¶ not even in a derogatory way.  This is getting very creepy.  Why we have to walk on eggshells ‚Ä¶ even here.  I think that Discus (this chat service) is run by you-know-who.  The walls are closing in.

        Just to put this in print, 1st (nothing really new but..) always refer to Covid 19 as ‚ÄúChina virus‚Äù and 2nd, always refer to the new (and 90+% effective) vaccine as the ‚ÄúTrump Vaccine‚Äù.

                I seldom talk about the virus itself at all.  I‚Äôll talk about Covid panic or Covid hysteria though.  After all, that‚Äôs the real threat.  When forced to mention the actual hateful little balls of RNA themselves I just say Beer Flu or, if my audience doesn‚Äôt mind a little folksy racism, Chung Flu, Wu Tang Flu, etc‚Ä¶I have another post in this thread about media discipline.  It‚Äôs sad that we still lag the Left in that regard.  I hate to admit it, but at this point, we‚Äôre in a war, not a debate.  One truism about war is that the truth is the first casualty.  There‚Äôs another part to that which inferences I‚Äôll leave to the reader.  It‚Äôs not that I try to lie or tell half truths, but I won‚Äôt bring a knife to a gunfight either.Once the Left is crushed we can have sober and objective scientific debates about climate change, viruses, sexuality and many other things again.

        If you want to pee off people say in corporate environment. Do the following.1) Get or duplicate the corporate letterhead. This is to make it look official.2) Use the name of some important but nasty manager or executive.so  the reader thinks it‚Äôs legit.3) Have the topic about something that is important to the company exec or boss amd mock the shit out of in the format of a official business memo.It‚Äôs even better when the target is another boss type.When the management reads it they will go apeshit.

            Driving is expensive and work . We haven‚Äôt lived in a car and dating culture for a couple of decades.Even ignoring COVID 19 almost no one is marrying, almost no one is dating and almost no one is having kids. No reason to drive other than chores and work.And frankly for a lot of young people  just calling an service is better. This is  going to become more common as people work at home and more things get delivered.And note unless its regulated away or there is a marriage/dating boom it will become cheaper and  far more common to use Uber or Lyft or just rent a car when they are needed.This won‚Äôt change under a DR system even  with mass repatriation. Tech has render people too antisocial and while that will correct over some decades , it may become too expensive to operate vehicles by then.

            I really hope they replace all the cops with social workers and trannies trained in buddhist conflict resolution and mindful meditation so that we can move past this awkward phase of negotiating against ourselves to dictate the terms of our surrender.

            Pistols have half the muzzle energy as same caliber rifles. Pistols have more felt recoil when aligning for a follow up shot, thus increasing the odds of a miss. Drawn pistols have a smaller profile as compared with rifles and under stress the pistol might be overlooked and the attack pressed when with a rifle the criminal sees it and smartly opts to beat feet.Handguns don‚Äôt put folks down immediately, pistol shot criminals can have plenty of fight left in them even as the walking dead attack and kill you and yours.If you have a pistol and the criminals are attacking with rifles, you will probably lose. If you have an AR pattern rifle, you can be attacked by multiple assailants and still prevail. If you have a pistol, the guy with the AR pattern rifle, and almost certainly two guys with an AR pattern rifle, will defeat you (you‚Äôre dead).Criminals attack in packs, an AR pattern rifle can neutralize a group fast and keep you alive.Criminals will always be able to acquire AR pattern rifles. A year ago in Chimpcongo the exact train care transporting AR pattern Colt rifles through Chimpcongo was somehow intercepted by a black gang and the rifles stolen. Criminals know how to get the firepower, so we need counter fire.Ask yourself:  why do police keep long-barreled firearms, most commonly AR pattern, in the trunk of their cruisers?

                Light foot, well said.  I might also add I‚Äôve never been in a training exercise where a pistol was drawn to facilitate an advance, only retreat.  The saying was always that a pistol was good to get you to your rifle.
