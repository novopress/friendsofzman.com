        I think you misread Vivek. He is perfectly fine with the incubation angle. He dislikes the athletic scholar and fully supports the nerd scrolling for “dates.” Still, thanks for pointing out the weird intrusion of globalists into a movement that claims to be “America First.”
Just saw where Trump is supporting Musk on this insanity. Utterly predictable.

        Remarkably, they did everything to ruin mandatory “education” for white kids and then call us stupid.  Problem-reaction-solution.  Eliminate everything but life skills and merit and watch those stupid, demoralized white kids head to the moon.

            Events pull in a certain direction, and I fear that under the technology now dominant, there’s no hope for nationalism; it’s going to be globalism (if the power stays on) or localism (if the power goes off). The future of human society is out of our hands.

                How can we fight back, when (a) we cannot define “who we are”, (b) “who they are” or even (b’) what do we want? Is it realistic and measurable?
We’re painted into a corner; Vivek was born in Cincinnati; meaning he’s as native as I am, according to the “American Credo”. Talking about how many generations your people have been here becomes like (to steal from Eddie Murphy here) “white guys always be measurin’ their dicks.”
Or as Butch said to his latina cab driver inPulp Fiction, “honey, names here don’t mean shit.”

People who know his writings know that Lenin was “far right” compared to anyone who got caught in Elon’s latest censorship spree.

        “Americans First.” What a remarkably simple, clarifying, and effective meme!
That is a dart that will stick.Well done, sir, very well done.
Or, if I may offer the highest compliment an Englishman can give…Not bad. Not bad at all.

            “Americans First” — a slogan that stirs a warm response in the hearts of the poor and the middle class — is less saleable among the rich, those who have both feet in the streams of globalization.
For a lawyer who does business in both London and Tokyo, he recognizes “Americans First” as being a threat to his transnational business. Holding dear to his contacts gives them extra emotional resonance in his mind. For a businessman who exports high-tech products from California, the reaction is the same: The WORLD first, America second.

            Some time ago, perhaps it was as long as three years ago, on another post on this Z-blog I posited the slogan “AmericansFirst.” Today it was good to hear Mr. Derbyshire echoing it!

                    Derb, maybe I missed it, but what’s happening now is a great opportunity to remind everyone again of the 2015 book “Sold Out” by Michelle Malkin and John Miano.Here’s the authors being interviewed on C-SPAN:https://www.c-span.org/program/book-tv/sold-out/420786

        Thanks for bringing up the globalism angle. I’ve been noting for a while that our political class, including Musk, believe that Trumpism is about populism vs elitism. On that front, Musk and Trump, side with the people. Neither was ever fully accepted by the current elite, so they have no love for them.However, Trumpism has another vein and that’s nationalism vs globalism. Trump supporters are nationalists. Musk and Vivek, aka King Cobra, are globalists. Vance has had feet in both camps but seems to be moving toward nationalist. Trump? Hard to say. He exhibits characteristics of both. Where Trump lands on this issue could very well make or break his term. We’ll see.

“Staple those green cards! Legal immigration for MAGA, baby! More foreign war from the peace candidate! Techno-surveillance for the flu! Two weeks to flatten the curve! Lock us into digital crypto wallets forever, daddy!”
My money is still on them deporting a token number of illegals. They’ll boot a few 100Ks and most of you here will fall for that too.

        “Did I mention that Krishnan is a native of India?”
It seems like our only hope, and it will be fiercely punished, is to speak explicitly about the ethnocentrism of non-whites and the effects it will have on whites, who are not allowed to notice.

        […] 1) The MAGA base intuits that H1B visas are a racket. Why wouldn’t they be? Everything else the federal government touches is — from presidential pardons to West Point to Jan 6 justice. America is the third largest nation on earth — a third-of-a-billion people, officially (rather more in actual reality). Why does it need to hire entry-level workers from the first and second largest nations? Yes, yes, too many Americans graduate in non-binary studies rather than any serious academic discipline but simply because you’ve bollocksed up your entire education system is no reason to (as my former National Review colleague John Derbyshire puts it) “import an overclass“.
