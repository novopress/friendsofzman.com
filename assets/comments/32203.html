Happy joonteenff!
Always remember that all but 14 Republicans across the House and Senate voted to make joonteenff a national holiday.
Our people have almost no representation in the federal government.  Just like in the UK.

            I know little about Juneteenth so maybe I‚Äôm way off base here, but isn‚Äôt it called ‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù because the blacks couldn‚Äôt remember when emancipation was, so dey wuz like, ‚ÄúYeah, uh, June something-teenth.‚Äù It‚Äôs a holiday based on obliviousness? Imagine Our Independence Day being called ‚ÄúJuly-ish‚Äù.

                ‚ÄùOur‚Äù holiday is based upon ignorance‚Äîboth 150 years ago and today as well.  That should be the first aspect noted.

            It was designed to try and supplant the 4th of July, and just became a meme for black criminality. Even the hard leftists don‚Äôt care about it. There‚Äôs only so much astroturfing you can do in the popular consciousness.

                        My standard reply to someone who brings up ‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù is to feign ignorance and ask, with earnestness: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a gay thing, right?‚Äù
It always drives lefty up the wall. Especially when I insist I heard it was a name for the (obligatory) ‚Äúpride‚Äù parade.
For additional subversive laughs, I ask them to tell me what it‚Äôs really about. 99 lefties out of 100 have only the dimmest idea.

                Yes. The folks I know who are desperate to signal their fealty are off for the day celebrating what should be called NPC day. It was the day Union soldiers rode to tell fellow whites to stop fighting as hostilities had formally ceased. Some NPCs were laying around and got wind of the news.Logged into Fidelity and got the notice: ‚ÄúAll major US stock markets will be closed June 19th in observance of the ‚ÄúJuneteenth National Independence Day.‚ÄùIt is only a matter of time before the Juneteenth is dropped and 4th of July is never referred to as Independence Day, and slowly it becomes a barbecue day while the GAE uses the low to supplant the former middle that did the fighting, dying, inventing, sacrificing, volunteering and building.We‚Äôll be given nothing and they will only be taking. Our Nation will survive as those with the will to preserve ourselves and strengthen our identity will carry on.

                You were right the first time. It‚Äôs pandering, not catering. If you talk to any normal blacks most don‚Äôt even know or care about Juneteenth, and are unaware it was even made a Federal holiday. If they had jobs, they‚Äôd be shocked that they don‚Äôt have to go in to work today.

                    My wife works for a big nasty tech company that shall not be named. She had off today. I think she should ask why they don‚Äôt get the entire month of June off for buggery celebration purposes.In the Middle Ages people supposedly had about half the days off for various saints feasts and remembrances. We sort of do the same thing but it‚Äôs different perverts and lowlifes instead. I ‚Äúcelebrated‚Äù by going to my Wednesday business networking meeting like every other Wednesday. We even have two Blacks in the group and neither of them mentioned it.Any guesses as to when we get MAP day (minor attracted person)?

            The ferals never miss an opportunity to prove all of the stereotypes correct.  In keeping tradition, they had a gun fight in central Texas celebrating their made up holiday for their idol St. Floyd.  It‚Äôs not getting much play in the local media, but Abbot is now offering a reward for capturing the shooter(s).  It‚Äôs laughable of course because the description released is ‚Äúyoung black male‚Äù.  CNN wasted no time in releasing a suspect description very early that matched a White man‚Ä¶ of course, this was quickly debunked and the story got memory holed as soon as it was found out to be a member of the criminal race.A close friend lives right near the fiasco and he is slowly turning from evangelical conservatard to a realist regarding the race issue.  He simply can‚Äôt ignore the trends.I found it humorous how on my neighborhood social media page, the White liberal moms where all up in arms and they were actually posting questions like ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt this being talked about?!‚Äù.  You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.

            I‚Äôm happy to say I am working today. Obviously, this nonsense ‚Äúholiday‚Äù was passed as the powers-that-be worked to further kulakize Whites after George Floyd died of a drug overdose (with the long-term goal of supplanting July 4th or Memorial Day), but I wonder how many Whites who supported it in 2020 now cringe at their support. Maybe I am naive but I do think that the past four eyes have been eye-opening for many, as black criminality has spiraled out of control, as you see multiple shootings every ‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù, as they realize that no matter what they say or do, the entire regime and its organs hates them and wants them dead.

            60 Minutes aired that revisionist history or retcon segment with the Rosenberg offspring. They tried to build some kind of case, any case, to mitigate the overall perception that their parents were spies, turncoats, wreckers, Commie sympathizers, parlor pinks or any other degenerate POS category.

                        The real reason they‚Äôre mad at Uncle Dolphie is because the puppet emperor, Stalin, was poised to conquer all of Europe.
Uncle Dolphie‚Äôs rushed Barbarossa panic attack foiled the launch of Stalin‚Äôs mass blitzkreig.
His alliance with the socialist dictator FDR‚Äôs New Deal regime, the genocidal Commonwealth imperialist Churchill, and the Chinese puppet Mao would‚Äôve created the final victory, the Conquest of the Aryan sphere, and the creation of the Global Jewish Empire.

                People keep looking for some superhero who can fix everything by doing stuff and issuing commands. They stick to this fantasy, so they reject anyone, like Trump, who has no magic to fix everything but can do some incremental good.
The perfect is the enemy of the good and, guaranteed, there will never be perfection.

                Perhaps not.  Biden has destroyed/exposed Trump‚Äôs hand.  Trump can no longer bluster or threaten as he once did.  American wrt military and economic superiority is a myth now laid bare for all the world to see.  This is dangerous as Trump may move to even more extremes to get his way in international affairs.  Trump has in the end a CEO mindset not a politician‚Äôs.

                    Trump is more inclined to negotiate and apply economic pressure to get his way, where Biden more inclined to  apply military pressure. T is more aware how Woke ideology has weakened our military, while B thinks it has been strengthened it. Diversity is our strength, doncha know?
Just finished Lionel Shriver‚Äôs (The Mandibles) ‚ÄúMania.‚ÄùVery funny, witty, satirical. She dares not talk about race, but she does write about Wokism &amp; DIEism, well IEism actually. DIEism without the D. I would recommend both ‚ÄúThe Mandibles‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMania‚Äù. She writes with a flair reminiscent of Tom Wolfe.

                    MacGregor got over his skis early on re: his fatalism about Ukraine, predicting its rapid surrender.  Maybe, like Putin, he mistakenly thought Western leaders were rational actors who would negotiate instead of flirting with nuclear armageddon.  But that doesn‚Äôt invalidate his broader geopolitical analysis, which is pretty consistent with the dissident right worldview.  I doubt he‚Äôs ‚Äúone of us‚Äù but I put him in the Good Guy Camp.

        Does it matter at all? Honestly, reading and posting makes us all feel a little better since we can commiserate with likeminded others, but it won‚Äôt make the difference of a piece of fly shit in a pepper pot. I will vote this November, for local issues like Sherriff and school board, since they haven‚Äôt fortified these for ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù yet (soon to come after a few elections where the correct choice isn‚Äôt made by the dirt people), but the rest of my ballot will remain blank, although I suspect that all blank ballot choices are marked ‚ÄúD‚Äù by the machines. I don‚Äôt feel completely hopeless, since I believe that God has a plan that I don‚Äôt have to like or understand. I also know that plan doesn‚Äôt necessarily end well for the Western world. I really don‚Äôt know what I feel. I‚Äôm in somewhat decent shape, can shoot and hunt better than most, have a good family, no debt, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it all could come crashing down with tomorrows headlines. The batshit crazy‚Äôs in charge want to start a nuclear conflict with Russia, think that a 35 trillion dollar debt is OK and who‚Äôs top priority is making sure that Israel has plenty of Goy support. John Derbyshire was right; WE ARE DOOMED.

                Hoagie. Your mistake is to believe that the people decide, when in fact Party apparatchiks decide.
I have no idea who they will choose, but of this i‚Äôm fairly certain: It will not be decided by a fair and honest election, nor will it be either Biden or Trump. A vote for Biden is a vote for that affirmative action hire and a vote for Trump will go in the trash bin.

        I haven‚Äôt written a ‚ÄúLetter to the Editor‚Äù for years now.  What is the point? The fellows at work are goading me into writing an LTE about the outrageousness of swamping Maine with Africans.In the past, I would write the LTE in a mild and reasoned tone, attempting to persuade folks on the fence.  Nowadays that is pointless.  Those folks on the fence have no ability to change government policy.  The regime does not care what they think.  Never did.  The situation at the border is not the result of anyone‚Äôs vote or voice.So this next letter will contain vitriol to let the regime know how much they are despised and give voice to all the frustrated people I know feel like I do.  The time for reasoned debate is long past.  [of course the LTE will be submitted under a pseudonym so I don‚Äôt lose my job.  I used not to have to do that].

            I think the time for writing to the editor is past. I think now is the time to become the editor ‚Äì that way you can publish the stories filled with vitriol and that name the names of the ticket takers who are getting paid to replace the people of Maine with Africans.

            When I was in grad school (1996-2000) I frequently wrote LTE‚Äôs to a major midwestern newspaper, and, surprisingly enough given the rightwing views they contained, the paper published most of them. If I was in my old uni‚Äôs grad school today and such letters got published, I would be expelled from the university, and I am not joking.

        In Britain there were sparks of light with The New Culture Forum. They are openly talking like us and despite the lack of 1st Amendment they talk far more openly than we do. One of their young guys even accurately described the loss of habitat as ethnic cleansing and the anti-white pogrom in the military as ethnic cleansing.However, their main guy, Pete Whittle, is certain to interview negros about white erasure in film and tv and has the usual lineup of non-white proxies to make the criticism of the system not subject to cries of racism. Before it even started they chose to hide behind proxies.Meanwhile in France things are getting hot.https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/16/native-french-pose-serious-problem-for-social-cohesion-says-far-left-leader-melenchon/I love what Zemmour said in response. I hate that a non-Gallic/Celtic person, a true Frenchman, is saying such things.The people of what may already no longer be The West face a choice. Will they choose sportsball and ‚Äúwinning‚Äù vicariously through aliens who hate them in real life, or will they choose living and winning in reality and take the heroic stand necessary to secure their existence and control over their territory bequeathed by the sweat and blood of their ancestors.We will know we are in the suddenly stage when Englishmen, Frenchmen, American and German men speak openly on behalf of their ancestors and their folk. When that happens, things are going to get white hot ‚Äì provided the folk at large choose to walk away from watching alien men dominate them in playing child‚Äôs games and choose to dominate in being masters of the real world.

The PartiReconqu√™te is the real thing. Did quite well in the recent elections and they have withdrawn from the approaching races where they would take votes from nationalist candidates, which is almost unheard of, but in an email earlier this week, he made it clear that he and Reconqu√™te are putting France ahead of party.Ôªø

        I see Farage as the English Steve Bannon.He moves the overton window, says all the right things and is dissident-adjacent, and could be in a position of power if he wanted to, but instead he seems to lead movements only to quit after the fun is over, and retreat to being a podcaster/radio person, and then chase populist or democratic movements in places OTHER than his home country.I hate to say this because I like both of them, or could like both of them. Bannon‚Äôs stunts and unfocus is bringing him jail time, and the same could happen to Farage.

            ‚ÄúIn a speech at Turning Point USA‚Äôs Detroit conference, Bannon bashed the legal cases against the formerpresidentand predicted, with certainty, that Trump will be sentenced to years in prison on July 11.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôve turned the legal system. They‚Äôve turned the legal system, whether it‚Äôs bankruptcy, whether it is taking away somebody‚Äôs law license, whether it‚Äôs de-banking, and they havethe greatest president this nation‚Äôs had since Abraham Lincoln, ‚Ä¶ .‚Äù
And that is where I clicked away from that POS.
THAT is Steve Bannon.

        There is some degree of comedy in the UK moving left (at the ballot box) merely because, and for no other reason than, the UK‚Äôs right is so discredited and useless, while simultaneously the rest of Europe is moving right, and the UK probably would too if there was any ‚Äúright‚Äù for them to move to.One wonders how the Brits who still vote Tory justify it in their minds, it seems unfathomable. Yet they exist, 21% according to this. Unlike with the ‚Äúleft‚Äù there is no mind virus or media brainwashing to explain it. It is like 21% of American voters looking at Lisa Murkowski and Lindsey Graham and saying to themselves ‚ÄúYes! That‚Äôs the stuff we need!‚Äù Perhaps the west deserves to implode.

The main reason is that the leader of the Conservatives is a Paki.

                It certainly doesn‚Äôt help that the Conservative leader is a Paki, but the main problem is the Conservative leader is a‚Ä¶Conservative.George Galloway is an execrable person, as a preface, but a most interesting thing happened when he recently won a special election to Parliament as a third-party candidate. Galloway cobbled together a coalition of Muslims and working white class whites to defeat the Labour candidate, and theConservativeleader was angry about it. Imagine that. Sunak‚Äôs putative opposition party lost an election to a third party, and he was pissed off about it. You would think, if politics were real, that his opponents taking such a hit would make him happy.It‚Äôs all a fraud.

        You have to wonder how much popular support the British state or the American one or probably any ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù version actually retains. People in the (former) West continue to have relatively prosperous lives, but as is the case with welfare recipients there is a sense of entitlement to plenty now. I suspect much of the spreading totalitarianism is in anticipation of the day prosperity ceases to be, but even the police state likely could not contain the uprisings. The revolution the Ruling Class seems to envision and the one that likely would take place are diametrically opposed. Same as it ever was.

            There are ‚Äúglass half empty‚Äù guys and ‚Äúglass half full‚Äù guys. For example, I reread today‚Äôs missive and I don‚Äôt see it as a ‚Äúhalf empty‚Äù black pill.

            If you haven‚Äôt figured it out yet, the central theme is about promoting loss of faith in our institutions but a slow-build trust in techocratic ones.

        Methinks collapse will preempt any political correction that may eventually evolve; and if so, then we may see a return of the Troubles all across the British Isles. If so, then the ensuing economic and existential hardship may be the only mechanism that actually reverses the invasion of illegals. Not even the Africans will stick around when turning the ignition key can be a death sentence.

        Things are even more interesting over in Germany, where the government seems hell bent on outlawing the ‚Äúfar right‚Äù AfD (Alternativ fur Deutschland) all in the name of saving democracy of course. While not a leading party, they are looking to straight up prohibit a party that appeals to maybe 10-20% of the electorate. It may not be the AfD specfically, but people are getting wounded and a polezi was stabbed to death by an Afghan (?) immigrant in Mannheim a few weeks ago.(I admit I only scan a few headlines, so I confess I may be wrong on lots of stuff here.)If the existing government succeeds in banning AfD, I have no idea what the future holds. For all I know, there may be a former solider with a trim mustache nursing his mug of lager in a Munich beer hall as we speak, who ahs some plans for the future.

            The young policeman murdered in Mannheim was trying to arrest a nationalist demonstrator‚Äìa German‚Äì(there were crowds in the streets), and the Muslim with the knife slashed and stabbed the cop, presumably just because he could. Point is ‚Ä¶ the cop was trying to suppress a German nationalist when he got stabbed and slashed by the New German. He died later in the hospital.

        This is why I am totally unsure about what moves the regime will make to fortify the 2024 elections. Say what you will, every regime needs some basis of legitimacy. Kicking out poll watchers, boarding up the windows, and announcing the new shipment of absentee ballots just happened to have 100% Biden in just enough quantity to win him just the states he needed is not going to do it. Throwing Trump in a gulag for crimes they just made up is not going to do it, and even for the arguably legitimate crimes they could get him on, their chosen prosecutors are too incompetent to deliver. The elite are too narcissistic and solipsistic to actually just let Trump win and then undermine him the way they did the first term. Even having Biden win is problematic because he is clearly too far-gone to keep it under wraps. Someone here posited that they will throw Trump AND Biden off the ballot jointly and nominate Newsom and Halley, and as crazy as it sounds, that might be the best option for them. They might even have President Newsom pardon Trump in a show of ‚Äúunity‚Äù.

        &lt;i&gt;Logically, the UK should never receive any asylum seekers as by law and logic, asylum seekers go to the nearest safe country for temporary refuge‚Ä¶&lt;/i&gt;
That‚Äôs not quite correct, because the Dublin Convention contains weasel language too. It states that an asylum seeker MAY be returned to the last safe country they were in, but the government MAY also choose to process them regardless.

        Essential immigration would be anything involving cheap foreigner doctors for the National Health Service, which as far as I can tell, is the only thing left that British people are allowed to be proud of anymore, even as it falls apart.cUcK Island was brought down by the allure of free government money, and quickly. The British cashed in their empire for free healthcare, and with it their self-respect. The Tory leadership, grifters all, apparently has no interest, or incentive, to actually *conserve* anything, and has managed to stay in power for quite some time simply by pointing at Labour as being worse. Which is undoubtedly true, but that line of thinking inevitably leads to candidates in the vein of Maryland‚Äôs Larry Hogan, opportunists who just occupy a seat and collect a check (well, cheque in this case).

        There‚Äôs a dynamic similar to the one described the Z-man in the UK here in France.  The National Rally party,, which is demonized as being ‚Äúextreme right,‚Äù is really a slightly left of center party that has a platform of curbing immigration somewhat, but not really eliminating it.  And mentioning remigration is like preaching heresy in the Vatican.  France may end up with a majority in the National Assembly of extreme left parties, since the ‚Äúright‚Äù is dividing and engaging in fratricide.

            You are right about Rassemblement National, butReconqu√™te has already withdrawn its candidates for the upcoming elections from all races where their presence could divide and weaken the nationalist vote. The French right is not engaging in fratricide. Here is [part of] Zemmour‚Äôs press statement of the 16th:Pour la victoire de nos id√©es et contre l‚Äôislamo-gauchisme, Reconqu√™te¬†investit 330 candidats aux √©lections l√©gislatives.Dans le grand combat qui s‚Äôannonce, toutes les forces de droite, sans exception, doivent imp√©rativement se mobiliser.C‚Äôest donc avec le sens du devoir que nous allons nous lancer dans cette bataille cruciale pour la survie de notre pays.330 candidats de Reconqu√™te plus motiv√©s que jamais,au regard de l‚Äôespoir que suscite cette dissolution, retourneront d√®s demain sur le terrain pour d√©fendre les couleurs de la France.Nous aurions voulu faire campagne dans une v√©ritable Union nationale, mais le Rassemblement national a refus√© √† plusieurs reprises notre proposition que tant de Fran√ßais appellent de leurs v≈ìux.Cependant, apr√®s avoir examin√© avec attention la carte √©lectorale,nous avons d√©cid√© de ne nous pr√©senter que dans 330 circonscriptions sur 577, afin d‚Äô√™tre certains de ne pas nuire aux autres candidats de droite engag√©s dans cette campagne.Nous aurions pu concourir dans toutes les circonscriptions, mais il ne sera jamais dit que nous ayons fait quoi que ce soit qui puisse favoriser une victoire de l‚Äôislamo-gauchisme que j‚Äôai combattu sans rel√¢che pendant 30 ans.Nous avons √©galement refus√© d‚Äôinvestir des candidats devant les artisans de l‚Äôunion nationale. Reconqu√™te apporte donc son soutien √† Eric Ciotti, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, Christelle D‚ÄôIntorni, Charles Prats ou encore Guilhem Carayon.[‚Ä¶]Notre s√©rieux est indiscutable et l‚Äôint√©r√™t de la France passera toujours avant l‚Äôint√©r√™t d‚Äôun parti.[‚Ä¶]La France a besoin des v√©rit√©s que Reconqu√™te a √† dire. L‚ÄôUnion nationale en a √©galement besoin.C‚Äôest √©galement notre honneur de respecter et d√©fendreles 1,3 million d‚Äô√©lecteurs qui ont vot√© Reconqu√™tepour les √©lections europ√©ennes, il y a une semaine √† peine, face √† tant d‚Äôautres listes. Comme tous les Fran√ßais, ils ont le droit de voir leurs id√©es repr√©sent√©es.Je m‚Äôexprimerai davantage sur tous ces sujets demain. Les Fran√ßais peuvent compter sur nous pour tout donner, assurer la victoire de la France et garantir que cette victoire soit fid√®le √† leurs attentes.√âric ZemmourThat ain‚Äôt fratricide.

        It was simple in the old days. What sold me on the Republicans back in my formative years was that they were pro-business, pro small government, pro-Israel, anti-abortion and anti-communist. Plus, my family was small business oriented and Republican oriented as well. Reagan made a lot of normal people money back in those days.That wasn‚Äôt a bad platform in it‚Äôs time and day.I‚Äôm still pro-business, but the Republican party is pro-globalist and I‚Äôm not really sure that a lot of business is what goes on out there anymore. It seems like everything centers around Wall Street, oligarchic enterprises, inflating the dollar away and the DJIA going up as a function of that.I‚Äôm sick of Israel and want to be done with them as most people around here, especially after what they pulled with Jeffrey Epstein. It is patently offensive that they have minders controlling Republican congressman. Patently offensive to have our people who supposedly represent us controlled by foreign interests, not to mention that most of them vote for the opposing party.Anti-communist has become anti-Russia. I can‚Äôt support that. I can support hostilities with a communist government, but I can‚Äôt support hostility with fellow Christians. (Especially since they are my ethnic cousins.)Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget immigration. The boneheads came up with their autopsy diagnosing Mitt Romney‚Äôs loss and that was the answer that came up with? Talk about.Abortion? I don‚Äôt care. Jesus had a chance to make it clear in the New Testament and he didn‚Äôt. Abortion existed in those days. If it was a big deal to him, he would have spelled it out in the New Testament.Times have changed. The Whigs are still stuck in the 1980s, as our host has commented on numerous occasions.

            ‚ÄúAbortion? I don‚Äôt care. Jesus had a chance to make it clear in the New Testament and he didn‚Äôt. Abortion existed in those days. If it was a big deal to him, he would have spelled it out in the New Testament.‚ÄùIt is spelled out in theDidache(‚ÄúTheLord‚Äôs Instruction to the Gentiles Through the Twelve Apostles.‚Äù Commonly called ‚ÄúThe Teaching of the Twelve Apostles‚Äù or even more commonly ‚ÄúThe Didache‚Äù pronounced did-uh-key by English speakers. It‚Äôs the root of such English words as ‚Äúdidactic‚Äù from the first word of the title(ŒîŒπŒ¥Œ±œá·Ω¥).This document is contemporary with much of the NT and is older than some of the NT and is mentioned by St Paul in the NT and is referred to four times in the NT, usually with the words ‚Äúteaching‚Äù or ‚Äútradition.‚ÄùIt is universally accepted as absolutely authentic. No scholars doubt its authenticity.It was always known that such a document existed but it was lost for a long time. It was discovered by a Greek Orthodox archbishop in 1873 while he was rummaging through an ancient monastery library, looking for something else. And the NT says point blank that not everything that Jesus said and did is recorded in the apostolic writings, but we now know that Christ did, in fact, outlaw abortion.In the Didache, abortion is equated withmurder, adultery, sodomy, fornication, theft, the practice of magic, sorcery,¬†and infanticide.I offer this info only as information, not to argue religion or morality with you.

        Z man, your comment thread has been hijacked by the Bull Connor Appreciation Society. The NAXALT and IKAGO hordes will not allow any deviation from theApproved Line. Just to be clear, I spent my day ridiculing both George Floyd and ‚ÄúJuneteemph‚Äù ‚Äî to black friends and acquaintances. My NAXALTs recognize the ruse. They know that a large proportion of their racial ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù are in fact feral animals. And they vote with their feet, just as ‚Äúwe‚Äù do.Fact: When the woke white progressives went after Uncle Ben, Aunt Jemima and even menthol cigarettes, the blacks I know were not happy about any of it. I guess Uncle Joe has had to backtrack on the smokes. Too bad he and his people never looked beyond their racial stereotypes and allowed the possibility that black people are, in fact, actual people.
