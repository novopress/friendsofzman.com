        Canada IS Bangladesh. As for the people weeping about the stock market, I learned to stop caring about that stuff long ago. I don’t care about my 401K. It’s money I’ll never see. If you think I’m wrong, look at what Greece did with their austerity measures over a decade ago. First they robbed pensions, then they went after private retirement investment. What’s my retirement investment? My kids. They’ll be there to spoon-feed me tapioca pudding and wheel my chair into a good spot to watch the sunset. Why? Because I did it for them. I can’t offer them much in terms of material wealth. What I can give them is a Soldier’s way of looking at the world. I’m working my ass off to make money now so I can get them set up and squared away. I’m not going to leave them up to their own devices like my parents did for me. If there’s one thing I can impart to my sons, it’s the concept of “don’t live to work, work to live.” I’m a 5th generation “live to work” person. It’s not pretty. I do not know what to do with myself when I’m not at work. I want better for my kids.

It’s certainly trending in that direction with all of these Indians moving here. All of a sudden we’ve started seeing ads referencing Diwali and the like over the past couple of years.

                I like reading this fellow site but he points this out:
https://patriactionary.wordpress.com/2025/03/31/%d1%80aje%d0%b5ti-%d1%80%d0%b5tey/
At the same time he insults Trump and the US. Hey, clean up the mess in your own back yard.

            I am in my mid-50s and penurious with two major life disabilities. I’m not on any public assistance. I work 3-4 hours daily at a machine shop. I have a PhD, taught at two Tier 2 universities for a decade, and once worked for Pat Buchanan.I own nothing. I take care of my 91-year-old mother, who is penniless and cannot walk (although she can still talk, a lot) in a rented home while my three sisters live in West Hollywood and the Upper East Side of New York. The one in NYC owns a $3 million apartment. They give my mother nothing and accuse me of scrounging off of her. As I have no friends nor a spouse to defend me from these accusations, I have to absorb the mental abuse. I am surrounded by soulless, ghoulish, materialistic, demonic narcissists who beat me into a pulp each day by 6 pm.I’m afraid a soldier’s way of looking at the world is hard to come by, and when you’re living it, it’s extremely lonely. I admire you and I pray your children are there for you someday. I know my mother did, but she only managed to get one of four, and not the best one, at that.

                Arthur,You have my support, for what it is worth here on the internets. I was fortunate as I have a loyal spouse by my side — when relatives abandoned an elderly man and his handicapped adult son. Not wanting to run a whiff of doxing self, but we cared for both for decades without help from anyone.The others were affluent, so as they went on their merry way, with occasional outbursts of maudlin ‘guilt’ and promises to ‘start helping’ … we went out own way and did so without rancor …. a mutual decision.It was soldiering, something I am also familiar with and I feel for you as going it alone is much more of a trial. Today, sir, from this tiny Reply box I consider you an American HERO and your efforts manly and worthy of the highest respect.The behavior of our own clan was part of our journey to this side of the divide. They remain on the other side, and happen to come running to me and mine whenever they have a ‘crisis.’

                    To add some more of my reply, the folks that were outside the loop also, what a surprise —- were 1000% in for the masks, jab — they sent around photos of one another getting needles in arms (no shit) on socialist media … one old biddy aunt sent my kids these stupid, thick polyester MASKS as Christmas gifts ….. and pestered me ‘did you give my gifts to the kids?’ … until I simply said the truth: “I threw them out.”

                        A Bad Man,
Sometimes, when enough is enough, calling a spade a spade is exactly the tonic that was needed.
A relative also got my two youngest masks for “gifts”. Like you, I binned them – but the relative never pestered me, so I said nothing. But she did attempt to put one on my youngest some time later… I looked at her and said “No”.
Truth be told, and may The Lord forgive me, I wanted to punch her.

Why would our Creator have needed to forgive you for your righteousness?
That doesn’t make any sense.

While we may never meet in person, here we are.
Me and mine have had our trials, that bonds us.
Haha — almost signed my usual email sign off with my IRL name! No matter, I am able to check that box as being ‘a human.’

                            Hi, just checking in now after two days, so you will probably never see this. No, I don’t — at least for another few years. I’ll eventually move South. I’m in the Northern part of the US.

                    You are in everyone’s prayers. There are organizations available that can provide support, fraternity, recreation, fellowship meaning and comfort. None of our folk have to be alone as we ride through the Kali Yuga.
Perhaps if you still have a traditional organization in your area that could help. Otherwise there are groups like:EXITOld Glory Club
and other emergent networks that are happy to reciprocate in mutual support and fraternity.

                No, you do not have to absorb mental abuse. This is another awakening going on in America. No, the economy “isn’t everything”. And no, the family is no longer everything. If family members are abusing you, cut them loose. There is nothing wrong with being alone when you’re surrounded by assholes.
I’m not rich either, but I’m free.

                    They come here and there’s not much I can do. I don’t have the resources to move out, nor could I, given the care necessary. I could call the police, but that would pretty much kill my mother. It’s a helluva thing. It’s normal for them to abuse others. It’s normal for so many. Someday it will end.

If they come around, you leave. Go put some extra hours in at the shop. Go for a stroll. And most of all – stop caring what they say or think. It sounds easy, but it’s incredibly difficult. You will have to work at it.
That’s my two bits. I’ve been through it myself and it isn’t easy. I won’t blame you at all if you give in and just take it… I did it for years.

                        It has been over 2 decades but I can still recall clearly, driving home from (caregiving location) when I brought up that WE had to stop being PO’d. See, we had non performing relatives, one in particular, that had this penchant for calling with these ‘we gotta do’s’ that were really YOU gotta do.No use being angry, we broke with it for good.Our experience —- again I recognize my good fortune and how MUCH MUCH harder your situation is … having a hard-working, non complaining spouse. I knew she was good when I first dropped by her house and she, living at home at the time being young, was out there cutting the lawn with an old push mower.Our thing mirrored the scripture of ‘Martha and Mary’ where she was great at tending to emotional needs .. abandoned old people can be very, very sad. While I repainted the house, got in the exterminators, rototilled the backyard and planted sod …. was better at the doing, doing.As a non wealthy person, this was out of pocket and I had 4 young children of my own. They often came along and in the end, it just became part of our life. There WERE very maudlin scenes, though, down the stretch as we had to deal with various guilty relatives, and their wailing.

                Lots of us in the same boat amigo.  Most expensive thing I own is an acoustic guitar, worth mebbe $300.  On my small retirement income, I cannot afford to live in the U.S., where one-bedrooms start at 2 grand a month.The Old America I lived in, in which almost all men had jobs and most had intact, FATHER-LED families, is long gone.  Only occasionally would we see a bum, and that only because I lived near the railroad tracks.  Now the streets are filled with homeless men, victims of cultural treachery and greed.This ain’t Old America, this is the New Amerika of elite betrayal and corporate graft and feminism, and New Amerika sucks the big one.

                Arthur,I feel compelled to answer such a comment by firstly saying that to suffer in this manner, and to endure, is the sort of thing that gets a man judged in tremendous favour by the only one that matters.You’ve found a haven here and I hope you make full use of it to see that you’re not alone. There are others that share your pain and there are others who feel the way you feel, although it is true that there do not seem to be many.You’re also correct about the prevalence of demonic narcissists, they are two-a-penny. And I say this as a man with a loving wife and three children. We have our bubble and one cannot rely too much on extended relations. I would give anything for my lads and pray they’d do the same for me. But who knows.I’ll tell you one thing: fear of God helps my wife and I. Daily repentance and prayer. It’s nourishment for the soul. You look out onto the demons and see them and say: “You’re bad; you’re evil.” and you pick yourself up and go.I pray further that you have the gift of Faith and that you have things you look forward to in this life. At the very least, you know the truth about the world and filth within it.God bless.

                Sometimes I wonder what will happen to me. I do not have any children, but my mother had six children, and when she got Alzheimer’s, I was the one who took care of her. After she passed away, I got afib, which I think came about from the stress. Try to take care of yourself if you can. On the bright side, after your mother passes, you can look forward to your sisters wailing on Facebook about how much they miss your mother. Try not to remind them they should have missed her while she was alive. Hang in there, better days are ahead, my friend

                Arthur, try reading Enjoy the Decline by Aaron Clarey. His idea is that white men try to suck it up and suffer through their lives while everyone else grifts off the system. The values that make white men not want to be parasites are from a world that no longer exists.
You write that you are not on assistance. Well get on it. You deserve it a lot more than Carlos, Kyisha and Jamal who never paid into it.
The system is rigged against decent men like you.

                    Mr./Ms. My Comment is 100% correct. My wife went after EVERYTHING she could when we stepped in to care care of 2 abandoned seniors in our family that we were separated by one and two generations from.Section 8, SSD, the works …. it was the difference between ME and my family suffering massive economic damage … or surviving as no one helped financially. If you can imagine having wealthy relatives, as in real wealth … enjoying the most wonderful lives, travel … and not doing shit.Nope, no guilt, suck EVERY cent out of the government in this situation. It is there for them, go get it.

                        What’s particularly galling is that my mother sits on Facebook all day long watching the photos and videos of her siblings’ children and grandchildren living incredible lives — some of them now in their late 60s, vacationing constantly, never-ending consumption. And my mother thinks nothing of it. “They’re entitled to it, they worked for it,” she’ll say.
It’s just the saddest thing. I appreciate all of the comments and replies here. They mean a million. I took a few days away and did not come back here until this morning, and missed all these replies. I apologize.

                Arthur Metcalf:“I am surrounded by soulless, ghoulish, materialistic, demonic narcissists who beat me into a pulp each day by 6 pm.”Well if the three sisters are scattered around West Hollywood and the Upper East Side of Manhattan, then how are you being beaten to a pulp each day? The sisters would have to be almost 3000 miles apart from one another.Is there yet another physical corpus [beyond yours and your Mom’s] which is a party to this story?Or is it more like long-distance telephone &amp; email harrassment?If you could give some examples of being beaten “into a pulp each day“, that would be most edifying.

            Very well said and fully agree. We have taken quite a bit of money from our 401K – and taken the expected and painful tax hit (no extra penalty now that we’re old).  We needed the cash and didn’t/don’t expect to see any of it when my husband does retire.  He’s still working precisely because we help both our kids as much as we can.  They have always been our ‘investment’ – when people used to ask my husband whether he had funds in gold or silver, he’d tell them “My money is in my kids.”  They are our ‘legacy,’ and we try as best we can to ameliorate the crappy world they are inheriting.

Often I think of your situation as it encourages me. “My money is in my kids”. Too right. Our blood is our biggest investment.
I only pray things continue to hold out for you.

                    Orange Frog:  Things are well, particularly for me and my husband.  We worry about our kids daily – not any particular crisis, just their economic behavior and overall national/international trends.  Your sons are still young, and I know the intense love and fear I feel when I video chat with my 3 1/2 year old tow-headed grandson. I pray that he – and your three ‘lads’ will not have to live as a hated, abused, and impoverishedminority.

Also, note that, in Klownworld Hellscape, 60yo is the new 30yo, just in case you weren’t aware; meaning that you might be 90yo before you can stop worrying to death about your kids.]

Using a nationally representative sample, regression analyses indicated that interracial couples demonstrated a higher level of mutual IPVthan monoracial white couples but a level similar to monoracial black couples.
That was written in 2013 and is still on the NIH website. How?

            This x10,000. I voted for Pres. Trump because I think that “collapse is the cure” and that this attempt at reformation will fail and be seen to have failed leading to systemic delegitimization, bringing about collapse more quickly than the sure but slow and steady collapse process of letting the clown trash grind European civilization down into the dirt. This is especially true for the demographic correlation of forces. Yes, the old rotten oak tree is coming down, but it matters very much which way it falls, and upon whom.

                The manufacturing top dog is always in favor of “free trade.” When it was Britain in the 19th century, it wanted it. When it was the USA after WW2, it wanted it. When it’s China today, it wants it. “Free trade” favors the country with the most manufacturing. The BYD plant in China is the size of a small city — they need to sell the BYD cars to the whole world. But countries other than the current top dog tend to be a bit more sceptical of “free trade.”

            Everyone concentrates on the “Free” part and forgets all about the “Trade” part.  If we actually had trade, we would have close to a neutral balance of trade.The whole concept of ‘free trade’ was abandoned many decades ago.  Trade used to be based on different economies with different strengths and weaknesses evening out their production and consumption.  Like we sent manufactured goods they could not produce to South America and got agricultural products from them we don’t have the climate to grow ourselves.Today, free trade is not about optimizing the economy based on resources or productivity. It’s multinational corporations sending equipment to the country with the least amount of worker and environment protection along with low wages and low taxes so they can exploit that economy and then import the products duty free into the home country.  When you are allowed to pack all your production equipment and ship it to the third world and manage it all from the West, it is simply not trade.January’s trade deficit was 130 Billion USD.

                As recently as my childhood, a trade map was readable as a map of local resources and abilities. These particular Asians are exceptionally smart and have little hands, so their women make usthese things,you’d hear, and it made sense. Of course other factors were involved too, but stories like that could be told. Every country and industry had one. Do we hear things like that anymore? (Only thatonly immigrantscan make food.)Now countries areassignedindustries. And they’re not rationally assigned, not even by economic standards. Yes, China makes our electronics because their workers are enslaved. But so are most of the world’s workers, and it’s not intelligent work, it’s just drudgery, so the fact that the Chinese aren’t idiots doesn’t matter. Why is this worktheirs? All your phone calls go to India, where they can’t be understood and everyone’s a congenital liar. (And all these stupid liars can come here and have your job and do it much worse, too, if they feel like it.) Who benefits? Why doesonly that benefit count?Isn’t “the economy”everything everyone does, Mr. Friedman?The actual existing economy seems designed to make life and everything in it as crappy as possible—not in the way Marx would predict, because he was talking about the evolution of anactual economy(nerd!). The only “growth” theactual actualeconomy cultivates is in the distance between money and you, people with money and you, and freedom and you. The specifics of it, the per-industry assignments etc., are just a sadistic board game whose victory condition iseverything displaced.What Trump’s doingresemblesthe kick the money changers’ table needs. It was the right kick in about 1985. I wish us luck. (We’re doomed.)

                    I hate to be a bore, but if the people on this side of the river are going to make it they have to start dealing in base reality and not telling themselves feel good stories.Chinese workers are NOT enslaved. If you know anything about manufacturing in the PRC (and I live as long-term expat on the edge of it and know a lot about it — no false modesty BS) then you know that one of the biggest problems facing firms is employ CHURN.There are a whole bunch of reasons why the PRC ate America’s lunch in manufacturing — and only a few (yes some for sure of them are due to some kind of Inscrutable Oriental Perfidy. And for the first genius who wants to raise a hand and yada on about Amazon Chinesium — all that says is that you are too poor or dumb to be in the market for the good stuff at higher price points. Maybe you even believe the ‘Designed in California, Manufactured in PRC’ bedtime story so lovingly engraved on the back of your phone 😛Mainly it’s thanks to your rotten elites — let’s say 70% and also the fecklessness of Western common folk who have also seriously lost the educational and work ethic plots. And because those perfectly ordinary Chinese who are more complex individuals than the slanty-eyed hive-beasts of your fevered imagininations know more than you have ever forgotten about Family, Clan, Race) want to get ahead in life.Truth hurts. But reality is the only yardstick. Slap the tariffs on, go make stuff. Stop blaming other people. That is all.Slaves. My ass. For the love of God stop it with the copes and just get on with it.

                “The whole concept of ‘free trade’ was abandoned many decades ago.”
The very first act of Congress, passed appropriately enough on July 4, was a tariff act.
“Today, free trade is … multinational corporations sending equipment to the country with the least amount of worker and environment protection along with low wages and low taxes so they can exploit that economy and then import the products duty free into the home country.”
Reminds me of the meme with the two guys in space suits, one staring at the earth, the other pointing a gun at his companion.
“Always has been.”

        Nationalism is back, and the managerial elite can’t make the switch. They have no concept nor feel for nationalism – outside of the usual suspects who only feel it for their people. We are all interchangeable widgets.
This mentality applies to economics as much as immigration. The idea of asking whether a policy – any policy – helps all of the American people simply doesn’t compute. They only ask whether it will increase GDP. What is an “American” anyway, they ask. These people can’t move forward.

            Unfortunately for the canadian, the nationalist movement as seen in the msm, is lead by the democrat/liberal socialist parties which comprise of almost every box on the ballot. It’s all based in Trump derangement syndrome. From a post-national country yesterday to national pride today…and the majority NPC population has switched to flying the flag instead of burning it.

                Mark Carney (our unelected prime minister) carries water for the globalist elite that has utterly transformed the country in ten years under the “leadership” of Justin Trudeau. In those ten years, we imported millions of third worlders and now young and not so young people, can’t afford a home or even rent as the demand has made prices sky rocket. Cheap foreign labor has cut the real wages and the health care system is overwhelmed by the third world tidal wave and the inevitable surge in demand of an aging and not reproducing population. The innate anti American bigotry of Canadians has been weaponized by the Liberals to, in all likelihoods, win yet another election. It is really the damndest thing to watch this unfold. It is distressing but unsurprising as this is the inevitable result of a post modern and post Christian society. The only positive outcome of another Liberal victory is hopefully another five years of pain will finally shake Alberta loose from this disaster of a country. The third worlders that have come for the cheque will vote for Santa Claus and not Scrooge so it is a race that we can hopefully win.

            No they cannot switch because it’s a generational thing. The younger people will need to clear the stage of the WEF crowd. As Arshad Ali implied today, it would be better if our ruling class could unite behind Trump’s efforts to reorient policy around the national (not corporate) interest. You remarked that this was never going to happen and I think you’re right. But his effort will have a hard time succeeding without a consensus. I still hold out hope for consensus because the Tech elite are never going to be able to continue business in Europe and get access to China without broad trade reform.

I understand the despair, but that is absurd. By far, the easiest way to boost GDP would be to nationalize health care. Turn Obamcrap up to 11. And, yet…

        “In the end, Bessent is correct.”Bessent-Carlson interview is worth listening to. It is heartening to me.  This is the first time I’ve heard a government official literally speak about the working man vs the “symbol manipulators”.  When pressed about the stock market decline, Bessent basically said ‘So what?’.  He then went on to (correctly) state that the top 10% of the people own 88% of the stock market, the next 40% own the other 12%.  The bottom 50% of the people live “hand to mouth” and have little concern about the “market”.  They (bottom 50%) do however have concern for basics such as food and energy costs.  Hell, even a job.I am today—as an upper 10%’er—20 percent “poorer” than a month ago. So what.  In my burg, the County is now discussing designating parks as “open air communities”.  Yep, the homeless problem is of such dimension now that they must be rounded up from the washes and abandoned buildings where they live in tents or cardboard boxes so that they may be fed and cared for like so much desert flora and fauna.  Anyone remember Hoovervilles?I remember my last visit to a third world shit-hole many, many years ago.  On the sidewalk in one city was a body—don’t know if dead or alive, but not moving—that folks, and myself, had to step over.  As I’ve said many times, 3rd world shit.Well, that 3rd world shit is here.  We’ve got one chance to rectify this peacefully.  Good luck to us all.

        I can attest that people in other parts of the world consider America a ‘shared country’, in which all persons globally are essentially U.S. citizens.  This has to stop.The trade agreements of past decades were great for the rich, and disaster for the rest of us, driving tens-of-millions into poverty.  A stock market correction does not affect the lower strata of the economic ladder, because so many now live paycheck-to-paycheck that investing in ANYTHING is a joke.  It is a greatly inflated market which pours money into the coffers of those who need it the least.Economic and trade matters are Donald’s strengths, as he proved in the first admin.  But America will continue to fail unless he — or someone — pulls the rug out from under the satanic Civil Rights Grift, especially the incentivization of females to have Hard-Charging Fabulous Careers instead of having babies.I see nobody on the national scene with the stones to stand up to the elites (e.g., Rockefellers) behind feminism and ‘civil rights’, which of course means Special Rights and Special Caste for everybody except white males.  Besides elites, a person would have to face-down the enormously organized Wimmin’s Lobbies and Organizations, plus the parents of daughters, who have benefitted massively from the anti-male pogroms of the past six decades.America’s streets teem with men tossed away in favor of Total Female Employment and Empowerment, and the ubiquitous, ridiculous girlbosses.  If this is not faced and fixed, all the economic legerdemain in the world will not save Ms. Amerika.

            There’s a thing called Plan B, it’s your exit strategy for when you start experiencing end of viable life episodes, you know, when your kids take the car keys away but don’t offer to drive you anywhere, or you can’t get in and out of the shower, serious intractable pain, or you take a hard fall and bang your head and wake up in a hospital bed-before that happens, you need to have a pre-planned exit strategy otherwise those decisions will be made by someone else “we know what’s best for you”. Stockpile pills, have the empty needle/syringe ready, can of ether and a plastic bag, or the revolver in the mouth. No one gets out of life alive, and don’t make your loved ones suffer along with you for months and years, and don’t let the medical system drain away every last bit of your estate then fight over the poor leavings.

        Having spent the last 35 adult working years saving 15-30% annually investing solely using “A random walk down Wall Street” as my guide (Index funds), this “correction” brings me no joy.Still, when the statistics of who owns most of it (very few, highly concentrated in very wealthy families and/or institutional investors), it’s impossible not to see why the bottom 50% of Americans who owe none of it just don’t give a flying fig.Something had to give.  Hopefully this punctures the balloon and sets the US up for 5-10 years of pain followed by prosperity reborn like the “Vockler Shock” of the 70s-80s.Much of the commentary goes along these lines;“We must do something!!!”“Wait, NOT THAT!!”

            Jamie “Echoes” Raskin at that Soros-funded protest (guess what guys, the money spigot is back on!) claimed that Trump “destroyed $6T of wealth” with his tariffs. Well, Jamie, I got news for you: if one man can destroy $6T of wealth with one stroke of the pen, it’s not real wealth. It’s paper.

            If you’re invested in the stock market, this correction hurts alright. But it will inevitably, and sooner rather than later reach a floor and then rebound. It always does. I confess to panicked selling during the Covid collapse, and I got my fingers burned. Lesson learned. This time I’ll just ride it out and buy on the dip.

                A good plan.  I view it thus: I didn’t make, or lose, any money until I actually sell it for dollars.  Thankfully, I’m in a position where I don’t have to sell in order to survive.

                “This time I’ll just ride it out and buy on the dip.“
If you have the ability to handle stress, a better way to do it is to sell only enough to buy some laddered puts. If you have to exercise them, it will offset the loss.
Personally, I think this dip is just hysteric overreaction, much like what happened when everyone and his dog got into day trading, so I won’t do much selling, but I am holding onto cash for the nonce.

                Well, I just got back from the car dealer where I bought one of those ridiculously overpriced new trucks.  As Dickens put it, “It was (is) the best of times, it was the worst of times”.  The salesman looked at my old truck with 26k miles incredulously.  Not a customer to be found at the dealership.  He finally asked the question, “Why”?My short answer was gonna be “fuck it”, but I thought that too bold—if not vague.  Since he’s the son of an old family friend, I told him “if I’ll gonna go out—given my age, health, and the economy—I’m going out in style and have some fun”.  If I make it, the truck is to be here April 19.  And no, I didn’t need a loan.

                        Well, see, this is one of those moral dilemmas for me personally.
After the divorce, my kids sided with my ex and she and they have all gone further and further left in the 30 years since then. My kids (they’re millennials) don’t want anything to do with me because of our political differences — which are a bigger issue for them than it is for me.
I suppose I ought to disown them as they seem to have disowned me, but I can’t bring myself to do it…

        It’s just impossible for an actual person to live in the economy we have today. We have our jobs, if we are lucky. We put in our time and get our pay. But we know that the system demands that company find a way to make us redundant and lay us off, by any means necessary. They can do this at any time for any reason and we have absolutely no recourse. We can’t actually be productive at our job because the system demands we change the way we work every few years in response to some new technology. Ability to pick up the new technology is valued over wisdom and experience, which is why the system is so unstable. We are basically flying by the seat of our pants 24/7, and people wonder why things like SSRI usage and alcoholism are out of control. You can’t build a family or have a comfortable life in this economy.Of course this is by design, because we are ruled by a hostile group of foreigners who hate us and do not want us to be comfortable or happy. There is also no accountability, we can’t pick up pitchforks and torches and go to the castle gates, because nobody is in charge. The economy is in charge.

        Energy costs are falling—crude is under sixty dollars a barrel.My wife was just informed by her father of the six pence drop in oil prices, apparently. Seeing that oil effects everything else, my first thought was: “let’s hope it holds out!”.I had to pop to Z’s to see what the take was because my wife had said that because of the tariffs, the EU was most upset and had threatened to “cut ties with America”. My response: “We’ll have to kick them out of all their EU bases, first!”.Trump really does seem to be making economic waves, so good for him. Don’t know how all this will play out here in The Isles, but the usual peoples are very, very, very upset with BOM.

        I hate the use of the word “unsustainable” in the context of our national economy. We have been well beyond “unsustainable” for decades now and eventual collapse is a matter of when, not if. Fiat money is an illusion of value based upon mass delusion, and that this bubble must burst at some future time is more certain than gravity. Only productivity can produce real value. Printing fake money to buy votes is not productivity. And the only real cure is to hang the money printers and their enablers.

            When I was a boy, my Dad got really excited about Reagan.  Even though I was young, I could see the optimism that Reagan brought to him.
I remember later when my Dad read that Reagan had borrowed and spent far more than Carter.
He was so disappointed and disillusioned.
Even the Reagan, the guy who made his bones promising small government, was defeated by the deep state.

                Poor America: always the victim.
If it’s not Europeans who apparently are unhappy with American malfeasance in the Middle East and the HUGE welfare costs of all the “refugees” it created, it’s Canadians saying mean things about Merkinland!
If only these foreigners were as altruistic and conflict-avoidant as the land of the phwee.

Europe has bought into global warming scam and made themselves energy poor.  They signed up for the EU and promoted open borders that allow these foreign “refugees” in.  They refuse to deport them.

        Tariffs are an essential part of the salutary assault on the financialized economy. Transitioning to an economy that makes things rather than paper will be necessarily painful. Whether the public can tolerate such pain in a liberal democracy is an open question, but Reagan won 49 states after the 82 recession, following reforms of a similar scale. Of course, the eighties were a better world, in every respect.Tarriffs are also a welcome tax on consumption, not production. That, if anything, is an even bigger potential change, the destruction of debt-driven consumerism, and even more necessary, in my opinion.Notice how all the “Smoot-Hawley” chicken littles are usurers.Finance should be the slave of industry, not its master.

            For the most part, finance (and to a lesser extent, real estate and insurance) is the whip hand because of government policy, especially corporate taxation.Used to be you could buy stock and get paid dividends. There was no effort to cheat on accounting because there was no need — a company either had the profits to pay dividends or it did not. Due diligence required nothing more than verifying that your dividend check cleared.Now, under “spend it or lose it” taxation the next quarter is all-important. No, you can’t save for a future business expansion. You MUST leverage whatever you have to borrow more, or government will take its cut of s third.

                I disagree with Mark Cuban on many things, but I have taken to heart his observation that stocks which don’t pay dividends are like baseball cards, whose perceived value has no more real connection to the company’s performance than the cards do to the player’s batting average or ERA. It’s only popularity, i.e., fashion, and the belief that there will be a future buyer willing to pay more than you paid for it.Stocks are tumbling now because that confidence is shaken, not because there’s some real cause &amp; effect relationship between these policy changes and the price of the stock.In short, stocks without dividends arecollectiblesand without the expectation of those future buyers have no real value (other, that is, than some small share of the proceeds should the company ever have to be liquidated.)

            “Notice how all the “Smoot-Hawley” chicken littles are usurers.”The Noticing cannot be stopped.
The Master himself, Martin Armstrong, puts paid to both the tariff myth and the Smoot-Hawley tariff myth:
https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/trade-war/why-is-trump-using-tariffs-the-truth-that-has-misled-the-world-on-tariffs/
It was the European banks privately defaulting on their sovereign debt that caused the Great Depression, not some tariff or the tariffs shortly before it (that no one mentions.)
Their credit dried up and so did ours. Simple as.It was a debt problem, not a tariff problem.

        Bessent is correct when he observes there are limits to borrowing. What Bessentdidn’t point outis that thereis no political will to stop borrowing!!!Bessent hasn’t said anything that hasn’t been said many times, many decades back. There were grumblings about borrowing in the 1980s and 1990s. To the best of my recollection, the borrowings continued. The sad fact of the matter is that, as long as someone is willing to let Uncle run up his drinking tab, he’s going to continue buying shots and the occasional round for his friends in the room. You can tart up his alcoholism with all the fancy trappings you like, but that doesn’t change this underlying truth. And not half as ugly as what’ll happen on the day the bartender announces he’s no longer welcome in the saloon.

            The issue is that borrowing is now totally baked in the economy and the culture. Everyone focuses on line going up, well GDP = C+I+G+NX, the “G” part is the government spending, so the best way to make line go up is to raise that G. Hence why it’s “good for the economy” to bring in Haitian cannibals and Venezuelan cartels, every single one of them gets Section 8, food stamps, Obamaphone, Medicaid, their kids go to school, all that is “good for the economy.” In fact, they are worth far more to the economy than the pesky natives because of the multiplier effect of all their gibs as well as the bureaucracy that serves them.The Brandon economy was a disaster but remember the official stats were all good news. A back-of-the-envelope calculation could tell you that all the good news, all the economic growth, was coming from deficit spending, and being the government, it was incredibly inefficient, but the way everyone talks and the things everyone cares about naturally leads to this situation.

Since Clinton, I believe, all these have been accounted for under C, not G. It was one of the scams behind the increasing appropriations, but stable or even decreasing G.

            The very idea of “borrowing” is a nonsense idea in this fiat system.  We create an eternal, never-to-be-discharged debt obligation, which is expected to be “risk free” for the lender.  It takes a deficit problem and makes it worse.  Any necessary expansion of the money supply similarly creates a debt obligation.It would be less damaging to really just “print” interest free money, and suffer any inflationary effects in as near real-time as possible.  It avoids the debt interest trap, reduces the competition for capital with the private sector, and in the case of the US, exports a lot of the impact to foreign dollar holders.MMT is used as a fig leaf for a lot of foolishness and bad policy, but when simply taken as a technical description of the monetary system’s operation it’s a more honest than what we’re working with now.  We need to break the power of debt interest.

Yes, though not by replacing it with neo-mercantilism. That’s just another grift, but unlike the “free” market, which is a wealth transfer from the lower and middle classes to the economic elites, neo-mercantilism is a wealth transfer from the same people, but to the political elites.

                I always wondered why the flood of Mexican silver (and Incan gold) bankrupted the Spanish Empire (and China too, by the way. Spanish and Portuguese sailing galleons loaded with ingots are why they shut the West out, silver inflation and foreign influence.)
The Crown should have commandeered all that excess production and sat on it as reserve collateral…but what was the king to do, go manhandle it and unload it himself? It got into the economy through a thousand private outlets.

                    The Chinese Empire was never bankrupted and silver inflation wasn’t a huge issue. The State had a voracious appetite for taxes and the only way taxes could be paid was in silver (paper money was widespread but not accepted in lieu of silver for taxation purposes).What the Manila Galleon trade did was suck a lot of gold out of China because you couldn’t pay your taxes with gold and this meant that the gold-silver exchange rate was skewed and provided an arbitrage advantage to the Spanish who could ship silver from Potosi or wherever to Manila, trade it with Chinese merchants for Gold and then ship that back to Europe.Until the Industrial Revolution the biggest problem in China trade was that the West produced virtually nothing that the Chinese wanted to trade for (except precious metals) and the occasional Jesuit to sort out calendrical drift problems. That problem got solved by showing up with superior naval power and forcing Bengal opium into their economy and then instituting punitive reprisals and demanding extra trade and territorial concessions when they took offence at this. Nice.China was also never quite closed off in the way that Tokugawa Japan was. But that’s another story.

        Other countries see trade as a way to maximize benefit to their countries via an industrial policy aimed at maximizing exports while minimizing imports (China is the king of this strategy). The effect is to drain wealth out of the countries that have no industrial policy of their own (pre-Trump USA). Tariffs are meant to prevent other countries from using industrial policy to impoverish the USA.

            When supposed conservatives argue against tariffs, like Stephen Moore, they are confessing their indifference to Americans.
They are saying that the world economy would be more efficient if middle and lower class Americans were brought down to the level of south americans.
Moore is a member of the Club for Growth, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, and the Heritage Foundation.
God, I hate traitors like him and these organizations that sell us down the river. To think that I gave respect to them for years!

Sorry, but that’s not correct. It drainsmoney, notwealth. Only the target country’s government can turn that into a wealth transfer via crappy monetary and fiscal policy.

        “If the economy demanded that the quality of your hand tools decline, you just lived with it.”
That’s one thing I was thinking about this morning. What have we really gained from international trade? As far as I can see, the only benefits have been more reliable cars from Japan and maybe higher end things like Bosch tools from Germany. Everything else has either been a wash or a degradation from what we used to have.

Read up on “CVT” transmissions. Once the likes of Toyota started using them … the whole ‘higher quality’ thing is completely out the window.
These things fail early are not repairable, and will put you out of pocket up to $10 grand if out of warranty.
And sorry, going to ‘buy American’ for cars sounds patriotic. Please, Chevrolet? Buy me a $90 grand truck that will have both engine and transmission failure around 60k miles? Put me on an endless debt loop of financing to do so?
I don’t think so.

        Absent any crying from the tech lords and such who were seated behind the Trump family on inauguration day (and I haven’t heard any yet), I assume this is all just part of the plan. Which I also assume is their agenda, not our agenda. Which is also my assumption about DOGE, that it has an unseen agenda beyond its public facing one. I guess it’s a fair question how much Trump is in on that plan and how much he’s just the puppet face of it.Anyhow, as long as the price of basic goods doesn’t soar through the roof, it’s no skin off my nose. You were asking for it if you were still heavily invested in this bubblicious market. No sympathy at all for folks invested in meme stocks like the Mag 7. I got out a year ago, as I posted here. Buffett backed off too, very publicly, so people can’t say they weren’t warned. But it seems that the only thing that can defeat greed (on a large scale) is line go down.

        “In the end, Bessent is correct. America cannot continue to create credit in the financial system and borrow trillions to hire government workers.”Agreed. And also agreed that the present system is unsustainable. I also want to say that a tariff wall is one of the instruments every industrialising country has used in the past, as it has carefully nurtured its fledgling industries from foreign competition. But it is just one of the instruments. One can’t expect a punitive tariff policy to single-handedly bring about re-industrialisation. And the figure that Trump is touting of $5 trillion dollars chomping at the bit to be invested in the USA is complete poppycock. If Trump is asking Americans to make such a sacrifice — and it’s Americans who will pay these tariffs — he should carefully delineate the argument behind the new policy. Just being punitive and vindictive against countries that often don’t have much of any tariffs against US goods won’t cut it. Vietnam does not have a 91% tariff on US goods. The uninhabited South Antarctica Island do not have a 20% tariff on US goods.If one is going to make a tariff wall work, it has to be done in conjunction with other things — investment in infrastructure, investment in training and vocational education, investment in physical plant. And it has to be done consistently over decades. Probably if Pat Buchanan were still around, he’d be saying the same thing.These tariffs are going to hit the indebted and overstretched US consumer hard. It’s going to be like root canal work without Novocaine.

            “it’s Americans who will pay these tariffs — he should carefully delineate the argument behind the new policy.”The argument above is one sided.  First, the tariffs are adjustable based upon mutual negotiation.  Second, some companies will adjust their pricing to reduce the tariff effect.  Third, arbitrage will play out in that companies will “adjust” from off shore to on shore production and eliminate the tariff. Fourth, on shore production will create jobs and tax revenue here in the US.  The bottom 50% of the population needs well paying production jobs—not simply cheaper Walmart junk.  Fifth, one is assuming no consumption adjustment to rising prices for foreign goods.All the above are unknowns of course, but the assumption that a trillion dollar plus trade deficit will continue—except upon the consumer’s back— is also an assumption based upon a static analysis.Finally, we’ve tried everything else.  What route is left?

                It’s so strange how economists will talk about, right from the jump, that taxes modify behavior and shape the economy, but when it comes to tariffs, they have absolutely no effect but that people pay more for goods.
It’s almost like this entire field is ideological, not academic or scientific.

                “Second, some companies will adjust their pricing to reduce the tariff effect.”Not to be the bearer of bad news but margins these days are usually razor-thin. If a Chinese-manufactured electric fan is being being made by some US company with its plant in China, which is then selling it to Walmart, both the manufacturer and Walmart are making razor-thin margins. Super profits are usually only in very high tech or in the protected military-industrial complex. If the margins are razor-thin, the cost of the tariff has to be passed onto the consumer.I agree with the rest of what you’ve written with the caveat that you need to be consistent over decades and invest in physical plant, physical infrastructure, less regulation, lower wages, and so on. And yes, you are correct: there is no alternative.But the idea that tariffs alone will cause this regeneration of lost manufacturing capability is magical thinking, Cargo Cult thinking.There’s probably more at play here than what I’m talking about. “Globalization”, whose burden has been shouldered by the USA, is dead. For some years now it’s been a dead man walking. Trump has bitten the bullet whereas previous “leaders” just kicked the can down the road. Secondly, the dollar as global reserve is also probably dead. Thirdly, this tariff policy is a tacit admission that US economic primacy, and by implication US economic hegemony, is over. The world will probably splinter into competing trade blocs as it did between 1919 and 1939, when Pax Britannica was over and Pax Americana had yet to be born.

                    “But the idea that tariffs alone will cause this regeneration of lost manufacturing capability is magical thinking, Cargo Cult thinking.”I am not under that assumption.  I added another line item wrt concurrent regulation changes/reductions—itself an independent effect, perhaps even greater than tariffs.  Alas, I got the message back that ‘the time for corrections/additions’ had passed.  I should have added a comment to myself in the above regard.I do continue to argue for the reduced prices effect however.  Heard a couple of companies so far saying they’d eat the tariff.  Of course, no one expects 60% tariff on China to be eaten, but some countries that export commodities can handle the 10-20% stuff.  Again, a static analysis of taking the prior balance of trade and adding the tariff and saying that is the extra cost consumers will be “eating” is doubtful as well.

                        “I am not under that assumption.”No, of course not. But that may be Trump’s thinking or what he’s trying to sell to the American public. What the Polynesians saw during WW2 was US forces building air bases, after which “magic birds” would fly down disgorging all manner of goods. After the war the Polynesians tried to replicate those air bases, thinking that if they could, then magic birds would fly down disgorging those desirable goods. They didn’t know, and couldn’t know, that a great deal more was at play. Hence the name “Cargo Cult” to this kind of delusional thinking. Likewise some might see that industrialising countries use a tariff wall and think that the tariff wall by itself is a panacea and will stimulate industry, not realising a great deal more is at play — such as strategic planning, investment in infrastructure, and so on.

                    I take exception to his point 5 as well,“Fifth, one is assuming no consumption adjustment to rising prices for foreign goods.”. It’s not like people living paycheck to paycheck are going to start saving more. They are going to substitute where they can, and cut out less important spending.
It’s a simple accounting tautology. Income=Consumption+Savings. In order to affect consumption adjustments, and savings don’t change, that is only possible with a rising real income.

                        No one suggested “savings” as you seem to define it, just that the effect of higher prices are somewhat ameliorated through alternatives—hopefully American—to the foreign imports.  Again, simply apportioning the calculated rise in import costs among families and pulling an estimate like $3500 per family from your ass is faulty reasoning and to my knowledge never correct.

                            t’s not savings as I define it. That’s what savings is. Whatever you do not spend out of what you earned, you saved. Doesn’t matter if you put it in an account somewhere or it fell out of your pockets and slid under the couch cushions.
Which is why the $3500 per family, wherever that came from, is absurd. Anyone who truly doesn’t have a pot to piss in (according to Bessent, half the population) could only spend $3500 extra by putting it on credit cards. They already save nothing, and can’t save any less than that.

                        The deluded idea out there in some circles is there has to be a reserve currency. But I don’t see any particular logic for one, and certainly not for some crypto-currency.The underpinning of the dollar from 1945 to 1971 was gold, but also that it ran a surplus in manufacturing exports. When that surplus became a deficit in the late ’60s, other countries started trading their surplus dollars for gold and so ultimately Nixon had to go off the gold standard. The new game became selling US debt for real goods and services — but that can only go on for so long. And that’s where we are today — with a desolate and de-industrialised wasteland, dependent on foreign imports and hoping that our IOUs will continue to be accepted as payment.The USA has its back to the wall — no question about that in my mind — and desperate times call for desperate measures.

        Hayek told us don’t let the war planners get ahold of the economy.
They did in WWII, with rationing; then, the soldiers came home and went to school on the GI Bill. That is where war planning became the corporate culture of academia and economic theory, as those young soldiers’ formative years were of being in war.
Part of that is that your troops are expendable, which meant Heritage America due to the low immigration rates allowed at the time. This is how Burnham’s Managerial Class formed, as he wrote about it in the still-white 1950s.

        All of this is fleeting unless they deal harshly with DOJ and FBI.  And DoD has survived unscathed for now.  That also needs to change.You did something in your essay that almost nobody else is doing: projecting calm and “we’ve had market corrections before”.  Too many people on our side are behaving in a callous manner.  Trump called questions about it “stupid” yesterday which was a rare unforced error.  The look on his face showed he immediately regretted his choice of words.This is fallout nobody talked about before it happened.  So a LOT of investors took a bath last week.  And the closer you are to 65, the harder it will be to recover.  Will it come back?  Maybe.  More likely is that it does not, but the long term cost of living comes down.  You need more money when gas costs $4 than when it costs $2.Then there’s the job situation.  This is a service-to-manufacturing shift.  A lot of young people will slowly need to move from Starbucks to Ford.  From Tax Prep services to clothing or microchip production.And not just young people.  Tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of government workers will need to get jobs in the productive economy.  And probably 3-4x that number of contractors.These changes are MASSIVE.  And that assumes Congress doesn’t balk at cuts, and that Congress deals with the Judge Problem.

        The never discussed topic is the big economic event of the year: the $6 plus Trillion of debt that the Treasury has to refinance this year, carrying interest rates of 2-3 %.The US 10 year was at 4.7% at the start of the year down to about 4.06%  today and falling..The shock in the financial markets has lead to the usual flight to quality : treasuries, the refi will go a lot easier now.

        Good tie in with last week. The alien oligarchs did not suddenly get a sense of not being alien. The situation is probably catastrophic and very serious and imminent. One problem with an oligarchy made up of people who by their early 20s had some technical skill and/or some talent for pumping and dumping to get rich quick is that they are pretty stupid and have no sense of civilizational thinking. Yet they have tremendous hubris. The situation is strange. The egalitarian utopians went into hyper looting phase and were salivating at the opportunity for racial revenge. Now we have technocratic utopians who are hyper competent but with a myopic view. Perhaps they can at least expand their civilizational thinking wide enough or be smart enough to hire on civilizational thinkers and then listen to them and give them room to fix. That means guys like Thiel need to look at spiteful and vengeful people like Eric Weinstein and Eric Kaufmann who openly display their hostility to the West and its people, and make some decisions about putting caring and nurturing folk in their place.In some good news, amongst the people Trump surrounded himself with are people like Karoline Levitt. She expressly stated from the Press Room that she is from a small town that for 3 generations has taken it in the shorts. I believe she is sincere and Trump chose her for a reason. Of course she is married to a 60 year old real estate tycoon. Would be nice if she married a young White man running a manufacturing business. We have to start somewhere.The US is probably in a very bad position. Let’s hope these reforms prevent collapse and let’s hope that they are not decrees but that Congress takes its limited time horizon and enacts some of these reforms into law.It is tempting to want to accelerate things via collapse. That is not what we want. Let’s do all we can do support and encourage viable reforms. I don’t think they can save things, but some reform can buy the prudent the time we need to prepare for the consequences of a century of civilizational dissolution and the consequences our posterity will have to live through. Let’s give them the tools and resources as best we can to help them. A couple of generations did much to earn the curses of their posterity. Let’s be the ones who provide some semblance of redemption.

            “Let’s hope these reforms prevent collapse …”No.It is not the pattern of ‘capitalism’ that needs to be saved, but our people.Demography is destiny. If we want our genetic and memetic (cultural) patterns to survive, we must have countries of our own again.However one defines “collapse” it must be thorough enough to facilitate pitiless remigration of the numerous parasites amongst us. This is a classic case of the old “perfection is the enemy of the good enough” still NEEDING to be good enough. Any solution that leaves Africans, Muslims, or especially Jews on the inside is simply not good enough.

                Hi Horace –I didn’t say it was exclusively the financial system that needs tending to. Thus, my invocation of civilizational thinking. A civilization is unique to and created by a people.I am with you that we need our own homeland to build as we see fit.I do disagree with you on the notion of collapse. A thorough collapse will, most likely, not result in mass remigration/repatriation. If anything, it will lead to more predation and worsening the problem. Yes. We need mass migration, and ultimately we need to restore who belongs and where do they belong. Only the people who created the civilization belong in its governance and institutional systems. Outsiders may come to do some well defined role/task, in very small numbers, but they should never be given institutional power.Mass deportations by force and by taking away the subsidies must happen and happen now. That must happen as a part of helping to prevent a catastrophic collapse. Supposedly they would save our pension and other ponzi schemes from bankruptcy. They only hastened their demise. We won’t be fooled about this any longer. We need to reach a place where advocates of mass immigration and of mass amnesty are considered as aiding and abetting an invasion and ethnic replacement of the folk.Now, Trump is problematic because of the natural contradictions in a merchant’s program. Trump understands the basic issues of the demos but he prizes economic growth as the ultimate good. This will be the undoing of demographic restoration unless a strong and sizable faction in his administration win the battle to define reform and restoration as starting with the restoration of the core ethnos. Unfortunately, we are spectators in that process. We voted him in on mass deportation, he needs to do it. If not, the other reforms not only don’t matter, they will hasten our demise.

        First there’s big tax cuts in expectation of vague spending cuts. Then large increases in military spending. Tax cuts made sense in the Kennedy administration with post-war tax rates. They are crazy given today’s debt. Evenifthe current Congress succeeds in codifying some DOGE cuts, these savings will be dwarfed by tax cuts and higher military spending. Not only will debt not be brought under control, it will likely increase. How is that differentthan Reaganomics, which is what got us into this mess in the first place?

                Cutting military spending in half was one of the best ideas he’s come up with. We spend more than most of the rest of the world combined; yet are still outproduced by the Russians. Getting out of the arms limitation agreements was supposed to give us a technological edge, but instead has left us in the dust. So, obviously, we need to spend even more to keep our MIC racket going.

        Scott Bessent was the guy who brought the plan to George Soros on how to bust the Bank of England (according to a trusty source.) This may be correct. It only alludes to this in his Wikipedia bio, doesn’t say he was THE guy but maybe he was.In any event he’s not stupid or crazy. The tariffs have a purpose. It will provide the shock to the system and after everything gets sorted out over the next few months we as a country will be better off. That’s in the medium term. I’m still pessimistic about the long-term but all of this will benefit the U.S. in the medium term after some short-term pain.The U.S. empire is a comprador empire composed of soft economic power (and some muscle when required). The system controlled by Washington operates to keep these corrupt leaders in power whether on a short or long leash I don’t know but always on a  leash. They will only show token resistance to Trump’s plan to re-industrialize US at their expense. They will redirect the investment required even if it hurts their own economies, they will sign tariff deals against the interests of their own people because they are Washington’s poodles.I’m not bitter about this, I’m an American and I say f*k them. But we are long-term in an era of global disinflation whether most people recognize this or not. The U.S. dollar will still be king for a long time to come because global liquidity is still going to be a big though hidden issue whether most people understand this or not.

                    Trump doesn’t do alternative conceptions of things, e.g., executive qualifications. His hirings are almost uniformly terrible. Other politicians’ are uniformly worse.
He does haveold-fashioned feelingsabout some things, so he behaves unusually in some ways. The system thinks it’s airtight, because it is—almost. Trump’s atavistic presence causes paroxysmal attacks in it and from it, against him and us. Sometimes it injures itself in confusion.
Can we expect better? Not really. He’s the greatest man currently possible. And it’s good to die strangely.

        I find you very knowledgeable and insightful on many topics, which is why it is so jarring to see you cite incorrect information about other countries’ tariffs. Canada has a free trade agreement with the US, and Canada does not have tariffs on the US that the US doesn’t also have on Canada. Canada has lower average applied tariffs than the US. The US collects more in tariffs from trade with the EU than vice versa. The US has a very large 25% universal tariff on light trucks, which are the most popular vehicle in America representing a third of all vehicle sales. The idea that the US doesn’t have tariffs and all the other countries do is simply not correct.You seem to be accidentally believing the word of someone you should know not to take literally. Doing so doesn’t lead to an understanding of why the market is reacting so poorly; it’s because Trump has blown up relationships with close allies and trading partners who have similar or lower tariffs on the US than the other way around, which is completely reckless and damaging for no benefit. Trump’s approach strongly indicates he doesn’t understand basic economics or how businesses operate and make decisions.

        About 18 years ago –  2007-2009 – the US stock market crashed almost 55%.  Because The Lightbringer was installed as President during that time – ending the reign of Bush the Second Evil – the event did not receive the end-of-the-world, utter doomsday treatment that this tiny quiver is getting from the media and the paid commie agitators.  Because Trump, of course.
We recovered from the so-called Great Recession.  We’ll recover from this minor hiccup as well.  Sooner rather than later, I would imagine.

        “This set off the Great Trump Stock Market Crash, which promises to continue this week as the rest of the world responds to the new world order.”That’s complete nonsense. The Dow made it’s all-time high on Dec. 4 2024, the NASDAQ on Feb 19 2025, and the S&amp;P on Jan 23 2025. The sell-off was well underway long before Trump announced his liberation day.The longest running joke in financial journalism is that news causes the market to go up and down. The news explanation is always complete nonsense. All my life I’ve been hearing “Dow up—on GOOD inflation numbers,” “S&amp;P down-on BAD nonfarm payrolls,” “Nasdaq up-on GOOD Fed numbers,” “Dow down-on BAD energy numbers.” The chattering classes always have to have a reason for why the market goes up or down.Of course, there are reasons, but they are never the reasons the chattering classes want to believe. Everyday there is good news and bad news, and the chattering classes cherry pick whatever news makes them feel good about whatever happened in the market. And everyone forgets when the chattering classes are wrong.Over the weekend, stock guru Jim Cramer warned that today would be Black Monday and that the market would crash. Instead, we had a strong rally.The word in the day trading live market rooms is that the fed closed the discount window to investment banks. Once the big banks were cut off from cheap money they began to unwind their positions. Thus, we had a sell-off at the all-time highs. The supply of other people’s money dried up, and it was time to cash in the profits to pay off the loans. Now, without cheap money, the big banks have to risk their own capital and they have decided to act rationally.And for the technicians out there, where do you think today’s rally started? It started at the support/resistance line established in November 2023. The market makers did a level sweep just below the support line to take out all the stop/loss orders, and then rallied the market all day long.Anyone hear that explanation in the financial press? Anyone? Beuhler? Beuhler?

        “The tariff knobdoes not go past one hundred.”On the contrary, tarrifs can go to infinity even though the knob’s indicator passes through only a finite number of degrees. It’s an intesting mathematical paradox. At some point however the tariffs can become so high that smugglers will find a niche opening up for them to exploit. Dockworkers and their bosses are rightly notorious for their corruption.Another side effect of sky high tariffs is the panic. If shaped intelligently, millions of criminal aliens may find it less frightening to return home. Why wait for the big, promised collapse to happen? They could find it too expensive to leave. MSM is doing its part here, no doubt unwittingly.

        I was up early this morning and I saw Victor David Hanson chiming in. For those who don’t know, he is part of the Hoover Institution. I see him as a moderate, boring, Republican college professor who actually still runs the family farm, so he is intimately familiar with the business side of things. Hands on, which is good. He is not a Trump fan, but he didn’t have very nasty things to say about the tariffs because the farming business gets caught up in the abuses from other countries.I dozed off after the first half hour, so I’m going to have to listen to it again to get the full picture. But I was surprised at his lack of negativity.https://youtu.be/_aI6bG1PI78?feature=shared

One can listen to him—if you’ve the time—and not get too angry if you are a fairly mellow conservative.  He says what you are thinking.  Hence affirmation.Where I criticize him is in his lack of radicalism wrt changing the status quo.  My comments to him are often directed to such.  He comments on known problems, but never new solutions—mostly old and tried/failed solutions if any.  He is best now in his 5-8 minute excerpts from longer discussions on his new YouTube channel.  He has his audience and punches in the correct direction, but like Chinese food, you’ll get hungry in a few hours and search for a new pundit.

                    I have a friend who goes occasionally. He’s famous and gets invites from the son of an old general. Nixon was righter than Alex Jones about it, apparently. He compares it to hanging out at Kid Rock’s fake White House, if you took away the “kegger” qualities of that (but not the drunkenness). A bunch of the same guys are regulars at both places. Reduce all conspiracy theories to accommodate that.

            I have come to detest Victor Davis Hanson. This is because I’m a skinflint and refuse to listen to any of the Youtube ads longer than I have to. And I also refuse to buy Youtube’s ad-free subscription. Consequently for almost half a year I endured listening to the opening of some ad showcasing VDH where he says “No Not Gonna Happen” and at that point I was able to hit the Skip button. This phrase No Not Gonna Happen has become firmly embedded in my mind. It’s my own fault for becoming addicted to YT but I think I;m gonna have to go cold turkey on YT because their ads are becoming more obnoxious by the day, more frequent and longer, and stacked two at a time. It’s gotten to the point that together with all the bullshit AI channels and the ads, it’s almost unwatchable anymore.

                Seems the problem with YouTube, and I’m assuming since I don’t publish, is that they’ve redone their renumeration algorithm to promote longer videos in order to collect $$$.  Hence just about every video is at a minimum 15 minutes, and often now an hour.  Even though the content may be adequately imparted in 5-8 minutes.  Who the hell has that much time to waste?

            I for one am looking forward to Z-Man’s promised takedown of VDH. Have been getting more and more tired of his meretricious/boomer (take your pic) takes on the state of the world.
The whole Central Valley Raisin Farm Hesiod shtick gets up my nose too. The Hoover is nice work if you can get it.
