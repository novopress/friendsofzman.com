        ‚ÄúJoel, let me give you  piece of advice.  Never, never, ever fuck with another man‚Äôs livelihood‚Äù.  You hit the point on the end.  Take the middle and start forcing it to pick sides and two things will happen.  The left will get the half that decides to go passively along.  But that‚Äôs it, they are passive.  They‚Äôve given up and turned their belly to the other dog.  The other half will say fuck it and throw in with ‚Äúmen of action‚Äù and that half will be motivated.  Problem for the left is that half  will have brains, money and arms.

            How do you know that Z man is a right winger? Maybe most of his economic ideals are thoroughly left wing in substance.

                That kid‚Äôs a piece of work ‚Äì and I love the name you came up with for him. I pretty much wrote him off as a clown long ago ‚Äì he‚Äôs just another performance artist.But ‚Äì This is why I listen to your podcasts. There‚Äôs REASON here. All this leftist lunacy and rage and violence is contagious and it sets up in our guys and the thing just goes to hell from there. At this blog, I feel like I am at  a dinner party in a clean upscale house with white carpets, enjoying a drink whilst being regaled by a witty host. All I have to do is sit back, listen and I walk away with good stuff to think about for the rest of the day. If they want to take the Alt Right upscale ‚Äì this is the place to start!I always make wise decisions.  üôÇYou guys have a great weekend.

I‚Äôm from Europe, for example, and it‚Äôs not uncommon here for people to get 100% of their news about America from the Daily show and John Oliver.

        Zman, I too have had some good conversations over the past few days with friends about race realism and politics thanks to the left bringing down these statues.  It helped that (after a bit of hesitation) Trump finally came out and said what needed to be said.  His words coupled with the video in Durham provided a powerful visual that helped shift the conversation for a lot of people to where it needed to be.  Trump is taking some unnecessary arrows over this because (as you point out) we are not being smart on symbolism.Those on the right in Europe have been dealing with the Marxists longer than we have and movements like Generation Identitare are being smarter in their messaging.  Their symbolism is clean, simple and striking, but not tied to the baggage that invokes fear in the normies (http://bit.ly/2uOUaK6).  They also understand that young men need to test their courage and strength and should be given the opportunity to do so.  Thus they are being educated and trained in an environment where they can positively network (http://bit.ly/2whD5ca).  As for confrontation and getting our message across, instead of meaningless s#!tshows against Obama/Soros pawns, why not strike quickly at the heart of institutions and make the cloud people know we exist.  Go to Facebook‚Äôs posh campus, Google‚Äôs HQ or better yet go to Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio or John McCain‚Äôs local offices and rattle their cage (http://bit.ly/W3ypQD).

        Medicare for all. Hey, Brazil has Medicare for all! You guys are gonna love it! We pay for it with some of the highest taxes in the hemisphere. And then we pay again for private health care to the tune of $600 per month for a family of four. Sure, things can get tight, what with the obligatory private school tuition of $600 per month per child on top of that. Won‚Äôt be long before the coyotes get run out of business. No sense in paying the fee to get more of the same.

        Completely agree with your last point about being forced to make a choice.It‚Äôs pretty much exactly the way I feel.  They expect me to embrace absolute craziness ‚Äì which goes completely against everything I have learned in my life from everything I have experienced.In what lunatic world would I do that?  They‚Äôve created the perfect recipe to piss me off.And yes ‚Äì when you take away everything from a person ‚Äì you have given them nothing to lose.  I‚Äôve made the argument in the past to lefties when I was arguing with them and they said stupid shit like ‚Äù you should be in jail‚Äù ‚Äì that putting me in jail ‚Äì would make me into a criminal.  Once you make me a criminal ‚Äì I have absolutely no reason to follow the laws any more.Is that REALLY what you want?

                Hmm, I didn‚Äôt realize Alternative Right was under scrutiny.‚ÄúAndy Nowicki aka the Nameless One is the assistant editor of the white supremacist Alternative Right blog, which was founded by alt right leader Richard Spencer. The Alternative Right weighs in on the alt right hot topics, from ‚Äòwhite sharia‚Äô and racial disparities in IQs, to the distinctions in thought between the ‚Äònormie‚Äô world versus the alt right. While Nowicki claims he is not a white nationalist, he shares many of those views. As an editor of Alternative Right, he gives voice to the ideology of white nationalists and figures on the alt right.‚Äùhttps://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/from-alt-right-to-alt-lite-naming-the-hate?_ga=2.36912864.1111144380.1501702308-907087844.1487459565

        Very long time reader, Z, and this is the first podcast I‚Äôve listened to, and my first reply.  The post volume+quality of your blog is outstanding, and I‚Äôm starting to see links back to you in multiple places, job well done.  Your Badder Thoughts are presented calmly, reasonably, so that Mr. Norm L. White listens/reads without triggering ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt allowed‚Äù defenses.  That‚Äôs something so utterly lost on the SpergTroopers of TRS, David Duke, et al.I am curious about your thoughts regarding Europa, AtomWaffen Division, etc.  For some reason their youthfulness kinda cancels out the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do the Nazi thing, fellas‚Äù reaction that I have to a collection of fat 30-50 somethings doing the same.  The ‚ÄúF*ck You‚Äù outrageousness of their graphics hits me in a positive way-and I realize they‚Äôre small in #, but some of those graphics stuck up on campuses were spot on messages given in the most ‚Äúblow me, SJW‚Äôs‚Äù fashion imaginable.  Just curious as to your opinion, which I value.Keep up the excellent work.

        A lot of you guys really hate Elton Musk. I don‚Äôt. I also don‚Äôt begrudge him all his billions from the government. Why? The stuff we‚Äôre paying him for is stuff I support. I want a cheap launcher for the country. Boeing has taken, quote,‚Äù‚Ä¶During the joint Senate-NASA presentation in September 2011, it was stated that the SLS program has a projected development cost of $18 billion through 2017, with $10 billion for the SLS rocket, $6 billion for the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and $2 billion for upgrades to the launch pad and other facilities at Kennedy Space Center‚Ä¶‚Äù. I think Boeing has $10 billion of this and have produced‚Ä¶nothing, nothing at all. Musk is saving us a damn fortune. His 5 billion is only a fraction of what was given to Boeing and he‚Äôs revolutionized the space industry. Same for solar power for houses. He took a fragmented DIY go no where market and provided financing so that many peoples power bills went down in cost. I support solar as a hedge against government control and individual freedom. Same for electric cars. He‚Äôs made it where now ALL companies assume they need an electric car or they will lose out. I support electric cars for defense, no oil needed, and for personal freedom. What he‚Äôs done is to strongly raise the individuals ability to not be controlled by the Oligarchs. His ideas on satellite internet will be similarly related by crashing the monopolist firm grip on our wallets. The amount he‚Äôs been paid is peanuts compared to what we have received in return. Congress passed these laws, I believe, well before he started doing any of these things. Just in Space launches alone he will have paid back every single dime we put into his pocket by lowering the launch cost.

            Trying to understand Musk in a political context is missing the point. Simply, the guy has no goals on Earth. Everything he‚Äôs involved with has an application for colonizing Mars, which is what obsesses him. Aside from SpaceX, look at Tesla ‚Äì transportation will be needed on Mars, but their ain‚Äôt no oil on Mars! What to do? Electric cars and solar power make sense ‚Äì more sense than they make on Earth!The surface of Mars offers no protection from radiation. People on Mars will need to live underground. Look at what the Boring Company is involved in ‚Äì robotic underground tunneling. Could come in handy on Mars, no?Musk is in the business of getting governments to finance development of technologies that will be useful on Mars under the pretext of them being useful on Earth.True, in a political context you could describe him as a tax leech, and he is. But that‚Äôs not all that he is. He‚Äôs a man with a dream prepared to use all means fair and foul to accomplish it. He does not care about your politics, he sees opportunities to advance his goal, and he takes them.I admire his single-mindedness and tenacity. If he‚Äôs successful, in 200 years nobody is going to care that he hoaxed the taxpayers to finance his goals, any more than anyone really cares that Jefferson‚Äôs Louisiana Purchase was technically illegal. He‚Äôll be remembered for the nobility of his goal, not the sleaziness of his methods. My hat is off to the guy, and I wish him all the luck in the world.

        Curious to know what your opinion of Instapundit is these days.   I‚Äôve been reading it since about 2003, and like most I was not impressed by its merger with PJM a few years ago.   PJM is a pathetic, virtue signalling collection of self described reformed liberals, female scolds, warmongers, charity cases, and fanatical loonies like David Goldman.   The merger by itself wouldn‚Äôt really be an issue, as Glenn used to be the sole contributor to his own feed, but unfortunately has allowed a handful of PJM‚Äôs more warmongerish representatives of the polite right contribute as of the last couple years, with most of their links predictably going back to PJM, or the insufferable storefront neocon synagogue twitchy.  The commentary has also degenerated in a hive mind of boot licking yes men, anxious for a reply for Reynolds himself.

        One point that is rarely covered in the diversity complaints about software companies.
Computer Science Programs graduate 5 men for every woman.   Bitching to Google or Intel or Apple that women are underrepresented by 5 : 1 is a basic supply problem.
If women choose to study other fields, that‚Äôs not Google‚Äôs or any other tech companies fault.

        I listened to the program and I have to say you have a really nice and clear voice. It‚Äôs a little halting due to maintaining a stream of conciousness without break, don‚Äôt worry about that, you can be a bit more conversational and guests are good for this.In terms of health care the solution is simple. Here it is, all citizens get Medicare automatically ‚Äì no sign up required. its a B-C level of cover, which will cover adequately but timing/choice is limited and is mainly for doctor and hospital treatments. This base safetynet cover is paid for purchase tax on goods and services (or just food if you like) not income so all pay.  For B plus to golden A cover you need to buy top up privately. The longer you wait to buy top up cover the more expensive to gets. Families can stay on the same plan till chdren are 25 years if they want to.  These covers also promote general health as well as treatments and look to support improvements in health eg. Discounts on gym membership, support to quit smoking, range of dental covers, coupons for discount push bikes, etc. on and on‚Ä¶anything the market wants to offer.

        There‚Äôs a lot of talk about concussions and CTE in hockey as well. I‚Äôve begun to think there‚Äôs something to it, but I hadn‚Äôt realized that the study you referred to had no controls, and the way the sample was selected was so unempirical. In hockey it‚Äôs linked to the movement to ban fighting from the game, so of course the chicks and cucks and manlets are on board. Surely more concussions are sustained from heads hitting the boards and the ice. Only a few of the less talented players fight. Guys who can score don‚Äôt have to drop the gloves (some of them do anyway). ESPN basically ignores hockey, which maybe makes sense since it‚Äôs such a white-dominated game. But the NHL and the hockey press has a strong cuck component.

            Taking blows to the head is never good. We‚Äôve been calling old boxers ‚Äúpunchy‚Äù for a century. This CTE stuff looks more like hysteria and maybe a scam too. That said, I‚Äôm all for making guys sit after a concussion. It‚Äôs for their own good.

        Denninger has covered what the problem with the healthcare sector is ‚Äì and that is monopolistic behavior and lack of government enforcement of laws already on the books.
The problem with healthcare is cost.  If healthcare was something that cost so damn much ‚Äì we wouldn‚Äôt even be talking about government solutions in the first place.

            Great podcast, Z-man. It was realistic, but didn‚Äôt have the black-pilled game over sentiment that I‚Äôve seen a lot of this week across cosa nostra. Thanks for the positivity. I listened to this on your youtube channel.

            I was right.  Red China- created by the same bolshie folks who gave us the USSR- was raised up when the Soviet Union fell.
Bannon sought to belay the coming One Belt-UN hegemony.  We forget that the USSR claimed fealty over 2/3 of the world‚Äôs surface in 1970, as the termites quietly grew their Deep State in the West.

These were literal Nazis. Are you seriously defending these people? It sure sounds like it.
I might not agree with all of antifa‚Äôs methods and goals but there is no gray area when it comes to actual white supremacists.
How are you gainfully employed and what has put such hate in your heart?
Side note-what beef do you have ramzpaul? You guys agree on everything
