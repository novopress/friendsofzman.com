        All I want is to ape the rules and practices which Mexico itself applies to illegal immigrants. Who could object to that, except for the custom of beating them on the way out?

        The problem is that the fraction of latinos who favor unrestricted immigration keeps going up.  IIRC, those latinos opposed to unrestricted immigration used to be around two-thirds about 20 years ago.  If we keep flooding the country with illegal immigrants, eventually you get to the point where the majority favor it.
