        I was looking forward to the show before I knew it was about now I‚Äôm really excited. I need this. I talked to a relative yesterday that likes to wear his mask in his car while he‚Äôs driving by himself because it shows the world have serious he is about this virus. He‚Äôs a doctor. How can he not realize that this is piety and religion not medicine and science.  absolute lunacy

            My Pillow will be the calling card we leave. After we lose and they make a movie about it, some vibrant, brilliant investigator will be the one who notices the My Pillows to be out of place in the homes where these crimes occur. She‚Äôll ask her supervisor ‚Äì a person-of-pallor ‚Äì  about it, who will dismiss it of course, but she will persevere. The final showdown will come when she traces the cell to their lair where she slays a sequence of White men who wear New Balance shoes, Hawaiian shirts, and Confederate flag pants. None of them are competent with their AR-15s.

        Well, Z, if all you are putting into these podcasts is 7 or 8 hours, I‚Äôd say you are getting a sweet return on investment. You can do in a couple of hours what the mass media can‚Äôt do at all anymore. I just want to say that I really appreciate the time and thought that you put into these things. I like the format, I like the organization and presentation, and I appreciate that you take my time and attention seriously.Have a great weekend.

        Zman, I think Tucker is paying attention to you.  Yesterday in the comments there was mention of how Tucker has let the shooting of five year old Cannon Hinnant go completely unmentioned.  Last night, Voila!  A fox news contributer was allowed to bring the story.Word is getting out.

            Twitter was bombarded with pleas for Tucker to cover the Cannon story. It‚Äôs remarkable how many won‚Äôt let this go and are determined to shame the mainstream media for their silence. This is one of those events that‚Äôs really had an affect on so many, and really drives home the hypocrisy. I‚Äôm glad Tucker covered it, but disappointed he didn‚Äôt give it the ‚Äúimagine if the races were reversed‚Äù treatment. He did, however, post the POS murderer‚Äôs picture.

            I heard normie women talking about the Cannon Hinnant in the office this morning.  They were outraged at both the murder and the double standard for protesting and media coverage.  I asked where they heard about it and they saw it on Facebook.  The mainstream media blackout was effective until social media allowed the story to spread.  Look for Facebook and Twitter to start finding ways from blocking these kinds of stories from going viral very soon.

        I absolutely LOVE the positive posts. if you are here, then you know things are bad. Hours and hours of pointing out how stupid normies are in 2016, is one thing, but in 2020, in our space, is a complete waste of time. We need positivity, community and collaborative direction. Thank you for being a conduit for that.

            That‚Äôs a shame. It‚Äôs only going to get worse. It‚Äôs like the government‚Äôs crackdown on the milita movement during the 90‚Äôs; this time around they‚Äôre cracking down on dissident voices via the internet. This has accelerated under Trump and he‚Äôs done nothing.

                Speaking of militias, I‚Äôve been poking around looking for a group to join that actually does something in real life.  I‚Äôm talking about even just actual meetings and some effort at assessing the local situation and local threats to ‚Äúlife, liberty, and private property‚Äù and maybe some rudimentary training.  So far I found the mymilitia website but activity there seems rather sluggish and more rant-oriented than activity focused.

                        This is solid advice. Many of the larger and well-known militia groups have been heavily infiltrated by the Feds. This has been discussed onCounter-Currents. It‚Äôs better to form some kind of special interest club with a couple of your buddies or those within your community and use it as a way to share ideas and train for worst case scenarios. Some examples could include a club/group of like-minded Dissidents who have a passion for boating, fishing, hunting, hiking, cars, literature, bible study, etc.

                            Thanks Amwolf and Major Hoople!  I know about the fed problem.  Actually I‚Äôve already encountered a different kind of problem.  My forays into the militia sites have turned up a few local people but they all seem to be libertarian types.  That‚Äôs good as far as some things go but they have a lot of the usual foolish lib notions too.  I‚Äôve also noticed that a lot of libertarians are really just about ‚Äúmuh weed‚Äù.  Not sure I want to be around a bunch of armed potheads.There‚Äôs also an interesting aspect of virtue signalling to their activities which is that some of them around here seem to make a big show of being against ‚Äúpolice violence‚Äù, even to the point of having lots of friends who are in BLM.  I‚Äôm not joining anything that is already pre-infested with the exact kind of BLM and antifa scum that any real citizens‚Äô militia should regard as the enemy.Well this is Western Oregon after all.  The local white people are even more dominated by weirdos than more classically liberal areas like urban California simply because almost everyone here is a recent arrival who came here precisely to find a better place to be a degenerate in.  I‚Äôve had some luck hanging out with people from the rural counties in the area.  They tend to be from old families who don‚Äôt care much for the hipsters flooding in.

                                You‚Äôre welcome! Thanks for sharing your experiences. I can resonate with your observations regarding the libertarian types who make up a large portion of the militia movement. From my experiences this holds true and many are pro-drugs, pro-legal immigration (regardless of the country of origin), and race-blind. Very few openly confront the race issues in this country ‚Äî or even decadence. I believe that today‚Äôs militia movement is far different than the one of the 90‚Äôs as they were more racially conscious and embraced traditional Christianity as a major part of their platform.It doesn‚Äôt take much to come to this realization ‚Äî just watch a couple of videos produced by self-proclaimed ‚ÄúPatriots‚Äù or Three Percenters‚Äù on YouTube. Many who present their take on the political landscape will make certain to express at one point or another that they ‚Äúdenounce racism of all forms‚Äù etc.

        ESPN released a ridiculously skewed survey on what sports fans think of social justice protests and statements by athletes. It showed overwhelming support for the protests. The sampling is absurd:‚ÄúIt included a base sample of 537 interviews and an additional oversample of 300 interviews with Black fans, who were then weighted into their proper proportion of the population.‚ÄùYou could also take this as a sign that normie white interest in sports has declined so much they weren‚Äôt willing to respond to the ESPN survey. That is probably a factor too.Clay Travis had a Twitter spat with Mark Cuban the other day. Clay pointed out NBA games are losing badly in the ratings to Tucker Carlson and Hannity. Cuban responded by pointing out the NBA is still getting higher ad rates and aren‚Äôt facing advertiser boycotts. How long will woke capitalism pay a premium to prop up woke sports?https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/29654147/survey-sports-fans-support-social-justice-stance-athletes-teams

            The linchpin of the sports system is ESPN and to a lesser degree the other sports channels. As soon as these channels become optional, the whole thing collapses. ESPN gets roughly eight bucks a month from every household in America with a TV hookup. About 20% of those households would buy the service if they had a choice. In other words, without their ability to tax non-viewers, ESPN cannot pay billions to these leagues.

                The major networks are still paying for the NFL.  People have to be willing to walk away from CBS and NBC too.  Streaming services are getting really customized in their live TV offerings.  I have seen several cheap ones that don‚Äôt include any sports channels.  Eventually the individual sports leagues will have to go their own direct to consumer models.  I think they have already hit peak revenue.

                I fully expect Disney to pressure cable companies to keep those terrible ESPN deals. Media consolidation will prolong the inevitable but I suspect even Disney knows it‚Äôs inevitable that ESPN gets cut loose or slashed down to irrelevance. Disney is a media monopoly but a lot of formerly profitable tent poles have been suffering.

                        Cord cutting has already happened.  Disney is getting the same rates from the streaming services they were getting from the cable companies.  The number of Disney Plus subscribers is huge and they are offering bundles of ESPN on to that.  I still think eventually the sports leagues will have to go direct to their fans, but we aren‚Äôt to that point yet.

                And of course the city kicking in massive taxpayer money to build the sportsball stadiums‚Ä¶ which we are rewarded for with the opportunity to buy nice $10 hot dogs to enjoy while enjoying the view of the great local egalitarians up in the (ever increasing numbers of) suites.



Brainstorm! We can continue essential sports during the TERRIBLE DEADLY PANDEMIC when taxpayers build new stadiums with 100% luxury suites. Talk about maintaining proper social distance!

            The powers that be are banking hard on sportsball being critical for subversion aimed at white guys now that white guys lost social media, television, movies, and music. If they lose white men as viewers and merchandise buyers, there‚Äôs not much agitprop left for them to view. We‚Äôll see how they will handle a now unsustainable business model.

            LOL at the methodology here.  ‚ÄúIntentional over sample weighted to its proper proportion of the population.‚Äù  They never covered this in my survey methodology class in college‚Ä¶
I clicked the link and‚Ä¶there‚Äôs no information about how the original questions were phrased!  Even among lefty polling houses like PPP, question language and crosstabs are always included.  The question was almost certainly phrased in such a way as to obtain the maximum number of positive responses.
If a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù outlet tried this, the Nate Silver set would laugh them out of the room‚Ä¶

                I am thinking the self selection process of participants would also skew results.  Would you want to take a survey giving ESPN your name, email address and other data and then tell them what you know they don‚Äôt want to hear and would consider you a hate filled bigot for expressing? Even white normie fans who are still tuning in wouldn‚Äôt bother doing this.

                        I‚Äôm skeptical to the point of cynicism, often times While I‚Äôve never studied sociology, I am plenty skeptical of any survey and you should be too. I‚Äôm especially dubious of when they are claimed to measure things that could be checked by impartial measurements. There are often differences, sometimes glaring, between what peoplesayand what theydo.Econmics calls this a ‚Äúrevealed preference.‚ÄùOn our side of the chasm, we can react with delight when some Rich Liberal gets ‚Äúbusted‚Äù for trying to keep his exclusive public school lily-white, yet his political leanings dictate he must maintain a public facade opposed to all manner of segregation. Apparently, even the Elite still believe it‚Äôs ok to discriminate by money and by academic potential and it‚Äôs one of the few points of agreement that I‚Äôd have with them.Witness the recent tumult with NYC‚Äôs high schools for the gifted. In Z‚Äôs area, Howard County, MD is also in the news. This liberal county is opposed to plans to bus the poor black and brown kids to better-performing white schools. I‚Äôm still waiting to read a study that shows that lousy students bussed to a ‚Äúgood‚Äù school magically become better students. It makes you wonder why no one has won a Nobel yet for finding out what that magic ingredient is, that Whites take with them when they abandon a neighborhood or a city. Surely there must be secret substance, some call it Magic Dirt, that they remove. What else could possibly explain the slide into the cesspool that inevitably happens after then Whites flee? üôÇ[Crickets].MemWarVet‚Äôs earlier comment about a survey that also collects personal information is a perfect example of how the result of a survey might be corrupted by fears of Big Brother ‚Äî not without reason. This is also why the US and other countries have (had?) a long tradition of the secret ballot. Some things can only be gauged by a direct question: ‚ÄúAre you satisfied? Angry? Confused?‚Äù But if it can be measured using direct measurements that can leave devious humans out of the loop, you‚Äôll probably get a more accurate reading.

                            As I‚Äôve referenced before, all is laid out in the book, ‚ÄúBad Students, not Bad Schools‚Äù, by Weissberg. It‚Äôs a classic and referenced to the hilt with 50 years of studies wrt mixed race schools and programs to lift the disadvantaged by dumbing down the advantaged.

        I went food shopping yesterday after work and it was hot and humid and raining. Masks are mandatory. Well, all that humidity and the humid air coming out of your mouth with that mask going up your face is very uncomfortable. I lowered that mask down for 2 seconds and that quick some supermarket employee mask nazi was like ‚Äúyou have to put on your mask!‚Äù  It‚Äôs actually worse now than it was in spring.  They still felt wierd telling people they had to put on a mask then.  It has become normal now.

                Philadelphia. Philadelphia has notoriously hot and humid summers. The hotter it gets, the more humid it is. There are very few trees and lots of hot surfaces. It‚Äôs very uncomfortable. Although it wasn‚Äôt that hot yesterday, it was just very humid, like 100% with off and on showers.Arguing with black supermarket workers is just a waste of time and energy.

                    Wow, having to deal with black supermarket workers under the current conditions must be hell.

        Average white people are just tuning out, rather than rioting.

This seems to anger the elites/leftists even more. With whites tuning out, they no longer have the evil Ben Shapiro right wing loser to debate against and win.

It seems to be working. They were desperately hoping for some right wing militias to come attempt to clear out CHAZ.

Woman hate not getting attention, and the collective left is the societal woman.

Yah, that‚Äôs what average people do. So where‚Äôs the above average white people? What have they been up to lately? The fact of the matter is that most white people have nothing to believe in. It‚Äôs the vision thing. Seriously, the average white guy is going to get us all killed. Let the dead bury the dead. Just follow your vision.

                    Exalent ! Here‚Äôs some wise words for those folks.‚ÄúWe are born into this time and must bravely follow the path to the destined end. There is no other way. Our duty is to hold on to the lost position, without hope, without rescue, like that Roman soldier whose bones were found in front of a door in Pompeii, who, during the eruption of Vesuvius, died at his post because they forgot to relieve him. That is greatness. That is what it means to be a thoroughbred. The honorable end is the one thing that can not be taken from a man.‚Äù‚Äï Oswald SpenglerI would add, that that‚Äôs the one thing that can not be taken from a woman either.

And these Chopin pieces you scored it with‚Ä¶ maybe a little Kendrick Lamar and underage girls twerking while saying sassy catchphrases would widen the demographic appeal.  Also we think the story should end with the unathletic nebbish guy running off with the blonde jock‚Äôs girlfriend and then all the WASPs fall in the pool while everyone laughs.

                    The American intelligence community always has been controlled by nepot fuck-ups. When you look at how they mishandled the coup against Trump, it  helps explain why the US IC has missed (in some cases, ignored for personal gain) every major development that it was supposed to catch.

            The Post Office is an interesting political football. I‚Äôm no expert on it, but it‚Äôs an odd institution. In the first place, it‚Äôs actually something the Constitution gives the Federal government authority to do ‚Äî a delegated power, imagine that! Inefficient or not, it has its place in commerce and communcations. What form it should (or will) take in the future is not mine to know. In modern times, an overlooked feature of the USPS is it is a huge emplolyer of Melanic Hominids¬Æ. In fact, it is often called an ‚Äúemployer of last resort‚Äù for many urban Blacks. This makes efforts to alter the USPS all the more problematic.

                The USPS is a huge reason there is any black middle class at all.
It also a huge poz vector. Go to a suburban or even exurban post office and check out who the staff are.
I rest my case.

                    Go to any large urban city and see who the employees are.  Majority minority.  Whites no longer need apply.  To a certain extent, that‚Äôs OK with me since Whites not longer live in those inner city areas.

                        Free trade has outsourced so many jobs that the government has become an employer of last resort for many minorities seeking middle-class employment. Many conservatives have no right to complain as they embraced the economic ideologies which caused this result. Don‚Äôt like your government being majority non-White?

Now that‚Äôs all contracted out to huge firms like Halliburton.  (And way more expensive). A shame. It was honorable work that‚Äôs led to a modest, but decent pension.  Good gig for the underclass of all races.

                            At least 50% of our population cannot hope to engage the high-paying abstract work many here are able to perform. There is dignity in work and it provides opportunity to self-improve in many ways. I know excellent folks who can only undertake manual labor, some of them with Downs Syndrome. Enable people to self-improve and if they do, treat them as your brothers and sisters. If their temperaments do not accept to serve others in exchange for sustenance, after a time, then let them starve and even snuff them out.

                    The Postal Service is also the only reason Amazon hasn‚Äôt (yet) been able to ban practically every controversial book and DVD. Watch these MAGApedes and anti-gubment libertarians destroy practically the only institution that isn‚Äôt allowed to politically discriminate on what they ship, leaving Bezos and a handful of leftist oligarchs to impose wide-ranging censorship on the right.If the Post Office is destroyed, even future libraries may find it difficult to obtain certain books if the only mail distributor refuses to carry them due to ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù and the publishing houses take a hint and stop printing them. Electronic is no alternative either because a handful of distributors can remove or alter purchased products on your device (or maybe the government/Google will use an AI to track down hate speech books one day and remove them from computers en masse).Maybe Z is right and this is all a simulation. I honestly can‚Äôt see how conservatives are so dumb as to not see that obvious trap from a mile away. Humans strike me as zombified NPCs most of the time. They regurgitate bits of programing (memes, ideologies they don‚Äôt understand) acquired elsewhere with practically no critical thinking accompanying them. All they do is spout slogans.

                Aside from a jobs bank for minorities, the USPS‚Äôs biggest problem is Congress.  On one hand, they demand they operate like an efficient business, on the other they interject all sorts of stipulation in how they act, whom they service, how they service, and what they charge for such services.  All while the private companies they compete with undercut them.
There is no way to alter the USPS without a clean break from Congress.

                        We can only hope.  The level of entitlement of their employees is legend.  When I was a teenager, had a summer job in NYC for a company to do errands for them.  One was to go to the local Post Office with their daily shipments and drop the packages off.These packages were boxed and taped like nothing you‚Äôd ever seen.  On the outside we‚Äôre not one, but two copies of the addressee and were labeled ‚ÄúHand stamp‚Äù, ‚Äò‚ÄôFragile‚Äù.  All were weighed and pre-stamped with proper postage.  The clerk in receiving only had to take the package from me. No other work involved, we did it all.Well, the clerk behind the counter took great glee in grabbing the box, stamping it hard with a rubber stamp, ‚ÄúReceived (today‚Äôs date)‚Äù,  then turning around and tossing it 10 or so feet into a large, wheeled, canvas basket with all the previous packages received.If I had 5 packages, the first went into the basket, then the other 4 got tossed in afterwards, one hitting the other.  One could imagine the amount of packages getting tossed around until the basket was emptied.  Hell, he could have waited until I left to mishandle them, but no‚Äîthat would take the fun out of it.  üôÅ

                    Yes, but there has always been the argument of near-universal service. You gotta admit, no one can deliver a first-class letter as cheaply from a leaky houseboat in Key West FL to a remote Innuit fishing village north of the Arctic Circle in AK. An extreme example perhaps, but I‚Äôd assume that millions have no option but USPS for much of their communciations and shipping. You could even make an argument that we should have an ‚Äúold fashioned‚Äù postal service (e.g. exclusive monopolies on certain services), as this was more traditional in Europe and later the USA. Privatization is not universally a good thing.

                                    Tell me what victory boomers have earned under Donald Trump that isn‚Äôt trivial or easily reversible. What exactly inspires your confidence? Seems like gross naivety at this point.Or ignorance. Honestly, you‚Äôre just insulting people to prevent them from stating the obvious about your candidate because that negatively reflects on your judgement. You don‚Äôt want the bubble burst on the delusion, but reality will do that soon enough on her own.‚ÄúAt least boomers grill delicious meat‚ÄùFueled by massive, unplayable debt and cheap imported labor. That‚Äôs all they did as their country burned down. Some accomplishment.‚Äúand can take forthright positions‚ÄùMost of which are wrong, unproductive, and contributed to this mess. Tell me how libertarianism is going to save the day again.‚Äú‚Äì what can you do?‚ÄùNot waste my time on grilling and watching sportsball, which is apparently beyond most boomers these days.

        The modern left is such a hothouse flower that if it doesn‚Äôt get constant approval and affirmation, they start wilting. Despite their position with institutions, they get blackpilled very easily. They hate Orange Cheeto Hitler but they know they‚Äôre being dealt an awful alternative with Biden and Harris.

The name of the game for the 2020 elections is running out the clock and lots of electoral fraud. So much fraud that it‚Äôs going to stir up the civic minded whites more than talking about black unemployment rates ever would.

            When the pozzed get all up about Trump, here‚Äôs the little bon mot I throw back at them.  ‚ÄúIf politics was really set up to do good, and politicians actually had everyone‚Äôs best interests at heart, why would they offer you Joe Biden as an alternative to Trump?  Out of hundreds of millions of people, they couldn‚Äôt find anyone who was not an ancient, white, male, grifting, sexist, finger rapist, addled, dementia sufferer?  There is nobody else?  They are offering nobody else, because they have no respect for you or your family‚Äôs well being, and you are being told ‚Äòfvck you‚Äô, to your face, with this whole Biden thing.

                    I used to occasionally do a live radio call-in talk show gig, a lifetime ago.  I was a ‚Äúfill-in‚Äù guy.  The trick is to know what you want to say. Speak clearly, in complete and proper sentences, and then shut up.  The format and rigid time blocks enforce the discipline.  To verbally fish around with your ideas, or to drone on, are two audio death sentences.  So is letting a caller do either of those things.
IMO, Z-man delivers a very disciplined podcast, and does all the little things correctly.

        Perhaps a little off topic but today‚Äôs Twisted Liberal Mind exhibit:https://news.yahoo.com/portland-state-disarms-campus-police-210049638.htmlNow, Yahoo has disabled comments, but still wants your opinion! Yeah, right. But if I could comment, this is what I‚Äôd say:Headline: ‚ÄúRacial injustice.‚ÄùLet me get this straight. Jason Washington is ‚Äúblack.‚Äù He sure doesn‚Äôt look so, from the one photo shown. He was involved in a drunken brawl, had a gun (legally),may have held the gun while police were present.Police warned him to drop the gun. Washington was shitface drunk. He gets shot multiple times and dies. Grand jury found no police wrong-doing. Just the same, the University decides to take away the police‚Äôs guns. The only thing Washington had done right was he had a carry permit. That alone is remarkable; apparently Oregon isn‚Äôt crazy-liberal (but this was 2018‚Ä¶) So let me see if I understand the University‚Äôs logic: police respond to violence in progress, the follow procedures. They demand agun-weildingsuspect drop his weapon and he refuses, so they shoot him. No evidence of any error on the cops‚Äô part. But they‚Äôre still disarming them??? I see the ‚Äúracial‚Äù part, apparently it‚Äôs only an issue when the suspect isn‚Äôt white. Meanwhile, where is the ‚Äúinjustice?‚Äù The police did everything right, by the account given.

        Great podcast today. One of your best. Once upon a time, ancient wisdom was passed down between generations via storytelling using parables. Today‚Äôs podcast had several segments of that sort, and the messaging couldn‚Äôt more timely or important in these turbulent times. People nowadays are desperate to create meaning in their lives, but have no idea how to accomplish that. Pitching a fit and picking a fight is what you do when you‚Äôre devoid of any other talents. Sad commentary on our current society.

                            There is a good chance that much of what we ‚Äúknow‚Äù of Caligula was written by his enemies after he was dead. They say history is written by the winners, but mostly it is written by the living.

            If you trolling for a lay the DR is a place you should look elsewhere. The male-female ratio in our thing is probably 100:1 because the overwhelming majority of women are compliant social-proofing herd following robots. So long as you are considered a ‚Äòfringe movement‚Äô with media painting you as the new SS it‚Äôll be you and your right hand on this journey.Your best bet is to hire a hooker to read you the Fountainhead while pegging you and furiously throwing roman salutes while chanting ‚Äúblut und boden!‚Äù Will sort of get you a bit closer to what you are looking for with far less effort methinks.

                Agreed. There are probably more traps in the DR than there are actual women. Most women will follow the lead of a confident man. Women are born followers via biology, better to just get a girlfriend and convert her to the cause.

                One retort for the women you speak of.  Yes, there were no notable rabble-rousers in 1776 that I recall, but women of that time were not like women of today.Note that the men who fought, left their women home to tend the farm and children and protect themselves as best they could against the dangers of the Indian allies of the British.  Even after the war, settler women had to fight‚Äîalone‚Äîagainst Indian attacks while the husband was on militia duty.  Read Danial Boone‚Äôs biography to get a picture of how hard things were in those early days.These women were not the equal of men, they were better.  If not for them, there would be no United States as the men would not have been able to perform their duties to the new nation.

                ‚ÄúIf you looking for marriage material, i would recommend finding excuse to live in eastern Europe for a year. They have their nuts too, it‚Äôs not paradise.‚ÄùI couldn‚Äôt agree more. I‚Äôve spent time in Russia and the women openly embrace traditionalism and most are anti-Western democracy ‚Äî especially the ones who are devout Eastern Orthodox Christians.Just beware that there are a handful of women in the Slavic countries who‚Äôve sold out their traditional heritage and yearn for Western modernism; they‚Äôre bitter and despise their countries. I‚Äôve met a Russian woman who fell into this camp and she was quit vocal about how ‚Äúregressive‚Äù Russia is because LGBT is frowned upon etc. She was an academic who was romantically involved with another academic in the United States ‚Äî so one shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. Nonetheless, she was still more genuine and humble than the average Western woman.

                    If you‚Äôre American, I strongly suggest you marry an American woman, so that you may have non-hyphenated American children.
Bi-tribal children often have some of the same identity issues as mixed race, if much less pronounced. The best gift you can give your children in the 21th C., is a solid, unambiguous tribal identity.

                        America is not a tribe (anymore?) it‚Äôs a place on a map, and on a good day, a government.
Someone sharing your religion and race is of your tribe.  Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a traditional catholic in Montana (of central european extraction) would you be more at home with A) a frizzy haired pan sexual jewess from Manhattan or B)a traditional catholic Hungarian woman from a small town in Hungary (she‚Äôs pots and pans sexual)
Admittedly a traditional catholic woman from Montana might be even better still ceteris paribus, but if someone had that available they probably wouldn‚Äôt be asking.

                            America is not a tribe (anymore?) it‚Äôs a place on a map, and on a good day, a government.You country is not the same as your tribe. There are almost 200 million heritage Americans, making you the largest European tribe on the planet.Fleeing to Eastern Europe is fleeing reality; when the barbarians are outside the gates of your little Slovak ethno-hideout, where are you going to run to then? When are you going to stand and tell them that they shall not pass?And I am obliged to note here the entitledness with which Americans discuss which country to pick as the lucky host of your expat asses. Large expat communities are trouble, even if they are racially compatible, and a flood of American ethno-refugees might not be received as enthusiastically as you might hope.Going expat is hard and before you even contemplate it, ask yourself if you‚Äôre ready to turn in your American passport and speak Slavic to your children, because that‚Äôs what it would take.Full disclosure: I‚Äôm from Denmark, so I‚Äôm not actually qualified to advice Americans on what to do, but this is the internet so there you have it.

There‚Äôs truth to this. I‚Äôve spoken with some women while in Russia who were both Russian and Serbian. While they respect traditional-minded Westerners who have a passion for Slavic culture (along as they‚Äôre not trying to infiltrate as spies), the general consensus is that they‚Äôre still viewed as outsiders and not overly welcomed for the long-term. However, I‚Äôve heard different perspectives on this and it really depends on who you‚Äôre speaking with.

                                    I‚Äôve noticed that Americans of all political stripes who decide that their homeland is ‚Äútoo ___‚Äù for them are often oddly provincial American in that they seem to assume that most other countries are as sloppy as theirs about immigration.  The reality is that none of the remotely civilized ones are.  I know it‚Äôs a shock but most other countries actually take their borders sort of seriously.In particular Russia and Eastern Europe have gotten back on their feet and found their souls again after Communism and being run by fools like Yeltsin.  They‚Äôre forming their own ideology that rejects both Communism and Western liberalism and pansexualism and will be suspicious of Western migrants.  There‚Äôs also the fact that outside the anglophone world no other nations are run by HR departments staffed with fat women whose only job is to protect you from ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù.  So if that landlord in Russia won‚Äôt rent to you because you‚Äôre a foreigner you‚Äôre probably just screwed.

                                        What you describe is probably the general case outside the English speaking countries, Western Europe, maybe Australia and Japan. On the upside, traditionally well-behaved foreigners with money to support themself are welcomed or at least tolerated nearly anywhere. You may not have too many ‚Äúrights‚Äù but most of your arrangements will be more like gentleman‚Äôs agreements. Not so hard if you can live like a tourist.

Hell, Americans show this provincialism  internally. Ask any Southerner what he thinks about the Yankees who have moved into his area, and then press him about it. The reason for the disdain is the Northerner displays provincialism and likes to boast about how they do it where he is from. The obvious absurdity comes from the preposition dangling at the end of the last sentence.

                                        ‚ÄúIn the rest of the world, being born an American citizen is considered an unparalleled privilege, even if we don‚Äôt like to talk about it.‚ÄùIs unparalleled privilege similar to white privilege?  Because our school told me that‚Äôs really bad and I don‚Äôt think a public school in such a kickass country would lie.Anyway even if I do move abroad I can always find things to remind me of all the privilege I previously enjoyed, like for example when the local American embassy in Bucharest flies the rainbow flag for pride month.  Reminds me of the privilege of trying to explain to children why two fat hirsute men were making out with what appeared (?) to be a single hairless teen boy in costco.‚ÄúSee little Jimmy sometimes when mommies and daddies love each other very much and they get married ‚Äì when they spend special time alone together they make a baby!  Except sometimes there are two daddies and the mommy is also a much younger daddy who loves both the other older fatter daddies in exchange for pills and there‚Äôs no babies involved, and they also don‚Äôt love each other and also they spend special time in the cereal aisle right in front of us instead of alone at home.  And also your actual daddy will lose his job and you‚Äôll have to leave your school if he says anything about it, so please just let‚Äôs leave‚ÄùIt will be sad for my kids though, to lose touch with real americans!  Like all the real americans from guatemala and somalia that they had in their class.  But say‚Ä¶ maybe if we bring enough pride flags WITH US it can be just like we carry America with us IN OUR HEARTS wherever we go!

It sounds to me as if you don‚Äôt even know what patriotism is. Are you, by any chance, a rootless cosmopolitan?

                                                Patriotism is just discount nationalism for the deracinated.  Morally equivalent to sportsball fandom.

Speaking of sportsball‚Ä¶

As a heritage American I cheered for (Irish Christian) Tyson Fury when he knocked the bix nood right out of Deonte Wilder (American jogger with 8 kids by 4 women).  Ifyou think there‚Äôs something wrong with this I don‚Äôt think we share assumptions.

Watching pretend fighting is for homosexuals, worse than sportsball.
Also, you keep speaking like a rootless cosmopolitan, what with your fondness for deconstructing perfectly straightforward terms like ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù.

                                                        It‚Äôs not a straightforward term though. It only seems that way because you live in a European country that is overwhelmingly homogeneous and has been that way through all of modern history. Tribal loyalty and state loyalty are synonymous there. Patriotism in the U.S. now means placing your tribal loyalty below loyalty to a state that hates you and discriminates against you based on your race and gender. No thanks. You‚Äôre nuts to outsource your ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù to any entity that does that.If you feel otherwise, please pack your bags and move here, then fight the good fight under your real name ‚Äî publicly. Betting you won‚Äôt.

That‚Äôs what the globalists want you to believe, because they hate patriots. Patriotism means love of country, not love of the state or ‚Äúmy country right and wrong‚Äù.
You can play three-card monte with terms like ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù and ‚Äúnationalism‚Äù, bend them to your discursive needs but patriotism is a straightforward emotion, only difficult to understand if you‚Äôve never felt it.

                                                ‚Äúthere are still many heritage Americans who are not ready to abandon their country just because their embassy fly a homo flag‚ÄùThen they‚Äôre fools. You aren‚Äôt winning this fight; the war is over. The situation reminds me of that scene in Battlestar Galactica when the commander finally realizes they lost with no hope of victory and the highest priority should now be preserving those few who remain. Americans are quickly approaching the same realization. Boomer rants about fighting when all is lost doesn‚Äôt change that. America will go the way of Zimbabwe and South Africa ‚Äî just as much disenfranchisement for White proles but with an even more diverse (and cruel) ruling class.In all of your many comments I‚Äôve never seen you offer a valid strategy beyond simply telling people to fight until they lose everything. There is value in knowing when to cut your losses. Napoleon was offered peace on terms he could have only dreamed of while he was imprisoned. He foolishly gambled everything and lost.That‚Äôs basically what you and company are arguing for here, which doesn‚Äôt surprise me as you aren‚Äôt an American and have no dog in this fight. Funny how you can lecture Americans about commenting on European countries they haven‚Äôt been to while also lecturing them about how to conduct their lives in a country you claim living in is a privilege while not actually living in yourself.

Didn‚Äôt happen.
And I gave due warning that my posts were written from a Danish perspective.
&lt;i&gt;no hope of victory and the highest priority should now be preserving those few who remain.&lt;/i&gt;
Point to country with more white people than America. You‚Äôre not even a minority yet, and you‚Äôll be the strongest ethnic group this century out at least.

But you go to war with the people you have, not with the people you wish you had.
And if they chase you out of your own (rather magnificent) country, how long do you think it‚Äôll take before they come for your little Whitekanda on the Donau?

Many of them ended up in a better place because of that choice; certainly their descendants did. What exactly is the difference between then and now?

                                You‚Äôve made that point before.  It is well taken.  Seems to me, if one is looking for a new country‚Äînot just a refuge of convenience‚Äîthen an American has few choices other than the English speaking countries derived from English colonization and heritage.That would leave us with Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.  Of course, Canada and GB seem fairly well alone the path of multi-culturalism, so I‚Äôd say Australia.Last I checked, one could retire there if one ‚Äúinvested‚Äù enough and had a stable income derived from abroad.  But it was a VISA that allow living there, but no citizenship possibility.I‚Äôve know a few persons who have successfully relocated to NZ as immigrants, but I can‚Äôt comment on whether they are happy or not.

                                    I‚Äôm afraid the anglophone world is thoroughly screwed. Going from one of its countries to the other is a pot/kettle exercise.

                                        I‚Äôve said it before: the Honesty and Openness that are a part of why Anglo societies work so well make them  very vulnerable to those who do not share those characteristics. The Jewish population in the UK is less than 300,000 yet they‚Äôve the same lock institutionally as in the US. All the Anglocountries are fucked.

                                    You sound more current than I know. At least in the 1990s, and it probably hasn‚Äôt changed much, many countries will welcome you as a tourist but usually want no one staying over 30 or 90 days, whatever. There are ways to game the system, like the old ‚Äúleave the country once a month and get passport stamped.‚Äù But to remain legally with visa and such, even if you are self-supporting, can be difficult in a lot of countries. And for the better countries like you mentioned, I thought it is very difficult to immigrate permanently?

                        This is solid advice and I don‚Äôt disagree with you. First and foremost, I wasn‚Äôt in Russia looking for a wife, but rather for professional endeavors and a religious pilgrimage. I‚Äôm 100% German-American and was raised as a Roman Catholic. However, I‚Äôve converted several of years ago to the ROC for obvious reasons. Nonetheless, I‚Äôd much rather find a traditional-minded woman in the United States than elsewhere for the reasons that you‚Äôve stated. I‚Äôve met some great women while spending time in conservative areas such as Western Kansas, Nebraska, northern Texas, the Dakotas, and Wyoming. They‚Äôre out there in therealAmericaand you most certainlywon‚Äôtfind them in any Cultural Marxist utopia.

                        Hear, hear. You are a gem, Felix, and given your nation of origin likely an uncut one. If American men want to save America and not the United States Empire, they need to marry American women and become baby manufacturers.
As for your comment below, yes. People in the States need to give up the presumptuous belief they can flee anywhere they want. It makes them complacent with the belief they can find refuge elsewhere, and they cannot. Why would any self-respecting European country want people from a failed state?

                    They do take their faith seriously, which is great. However, it‚Äôs unfortunate that the US State Department continues to meddle in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (along with other sects) in efforts to weaken the Russian Orthodox Church.

                                Russia will soon be completely surrounded by Atlanticists. Root for China as they‚Äôre one of the few pillars  holding back a full unipolar world takeover. The BRICS are leading the way to a new, multipolar world, but if China is weakened, that will quickly change as the pressure is mounting against Russia.

                DEPENDS on the type of Catholic church, though.Be careful.The Novus Ordo version that thinks interpretive dance passes for The solemn Mass is probably not where you‚Äôll find a likely candidate.They are 98% pozzed, as well.Gotta go to the Latin Mass locations instead.

        TRUMP! I was able in the People‚Äôs Kommunist Republik of Kaliforina, to order STANDARD CAPACITY magazines! Joy! Standard Capacity!That alone means I will be voting Trump! It was his appointments to the 9th Circuit Court. That stuff matters.I would also disagree that the neo-cons are obsessed with Israel or that they have the interests of Israel as their main concern. Trump has been the best friend of Israel in decades going back to Truman. And he has done it by not fighting wars but bringing mutual enemies of the new Axis powers together.Sharon famously advised Bush not to invade Iraq nor topple Saddam. The Israelis did not like Saddam but he was a counter-weight to Iran which was their most dangerous enemy. Now of course the Iranians hold much/most of Iraq, are allied with the Syrians, and bizarrely with the Turks (who were against them before they were allied with them) and Russians. All of whom have transparent designs on each other‚Äôs territories.Erdogan has made no secret of his desire to restore the Ottoman Empire, all of it, including the Balkans, Ukraine, and Crimean Peninsula. As well as much of Central Asia. The Iranians dream of a new Persian Empire including Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, and Greece, Anatolia, and the Balkans. Putin has made no secret of his desire to recover Constantinople and Anatolia as the Third Rome. These three will eventually fight each other but for now they have the Saudis and Emirates scared enough to get close to Israel and recognize Israel.The Neo-Cons are just the intellectual complement to the corruption of the Generals and Admirals. The Vietnam War was very, very bad for the US since it proved a path for promotion and advancement: low intensity, non mass industrial warfare where colonels and lower ranked generals can larp around directing special forces olympics in engagements without much risk to themselves, just the men under them. And various intellectuals can write all sorts of theoretical tracts that don‚Äôt risk exposure as wrong as in industrial warfare.Indeed you could argue that much of what is wrong with our military has been the revolt of the generals and admirals against WWII where incompetent and stupid commanders were rapidly weeded out and promotion through the ranks was common. Just as the revolt of the elites against the middle class was driven by rage and disgust of as Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy once said, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point of being rich if ordinary people can have nice things too?‚ÄùThere is a reason we don‚Äôt win wars ‚Äî to win them would require mass industrial mobilization like WWII and that would expose sub par and incompetent commanders rapidly. So instead we have very ridiculous limited wars where we cannot possibly win and they drag on for years ‚Äî which is the point. How else can a Mattis, a McChrystal, etc. get famous and promoted?Nobody wants to be Norman Schwarzkopf. He just won a decisive victory, massively, and ended up ‚Ä¶ forgotten. Mattis on MSNBC every night. There is a lesson there.TLDR: our military leadership is like a really bad coaching staff running the prevent defense constantly as they don‚Äôt have the skills to do anything that could lead to them being exposed as the incompetents they are.

            It is a bit of a white pill that young, White Southern and Midwestern men have stopped joining the military to a major degree and realize what a grift and a pozzed fraud it is. After the Corona-inspired economic collapse, there were breathless reports the recruitment numbers had gone up. It turned out to be untrue. The number of inquiries had risen but there was little follow through.
The military will be as despised as Congress in a few years.It is well-deserved loathing.

            Whiskey: ‚ÄúSharon famously advised Bush not to invade Iraq nor topple Saddam.‚Äù
I was skeptical of Whiskey‚Äôs claim because it seems clear that all of our engagements in the Middle East are for literally no other reason than to protect Israel.
With a little searching, I did find this:https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3444393,00.html
According to this article, Israel wanted us to attack Iran instead of Iraq, which is hardly any better.
Nonetheless, if the USA‚Äôs attack on Iraq was not ordered by Israel, then what was the purpose?  Whiskey‚Äôs answer:  a path for promotion and advancement for generals.

Basically, they will argue that in those unenlightened times, the systemic racism and misogyny was so pervasive that a stronk, independent, womyn of color that dreamt of a life serving the public had no other choice to get her career rolling than to turn to a trail blazing mentor of color.


And that will be that.


Powerful white guys calling her a whore will fall right into a huge narrative bear trap the Left will use to hobble Trump.

            Yes, because racism no whyte male would do what was right. Luckily Willie Wakanda gave her the golden ticket: he grabbed her by the poosy. She was that little girl.Trump was right about the grabby part, but he is the wrong color. So much of our r.history version 6.66 is like that apparently.President Kamala Sutra Hyphen Chosen is in many ways a perfect embodiment of the empty vessel of real americanism carrying kolored koolaid to the thirsty blank slate goodwhites looking to transcend their white sins with downward dogs and xanax as they all chant: you didn‚Äôt build this.The fact that a foreigner can become prez-lite because tween her legs is not that irrational given most single female voters here have only two issues that sway their votes and both have to do with tween their legs: abortion and open borders.

                Exactly.  Christians in particular are inclined to trust institutions to take care of them ‚Äì it‚Äôs a conservative trap in general.  Institutional subversion ‚Äì church leadership, media like Fox, schools, law enforcement ‚Äì has been the principal means of destroying most everything conservatives and Christians have lost in the last 50+ years.
And when you point that out, too many prefer to kill the messenger rather than face the cog-disso that there is no one in power on their side.

                            So if you‚Äôre given a choice between arsenic and cyanide‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd as soon take cyanide?Maybe you don‚Äôt chemistry or just don‚Äôt value your life particularly‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs a terrible metaphor. I‚Äôll definitely take my chances with the arsenic thanks all the same.Do you know anything about guns?Would you rather be shot with a .22LR or a 308 round.

Can we quit with the adolescent thinking that if something doesn‚Äôt immediately grant eternal victory it‚Äôs not worth doing?The left has slowly eaten away at the foundations of our civilization for centuries, like generations of termites. There are cat lady librarians who spent years in college just to become librarians, just to unobtrusively put a couple books about gay lions in your local library kids section. This has been their entire life‚Äôs work and they‚Äôre satisfied with that.Can we even muster the conviction necessary to spend a cumulative half hour voting against their girl up for POTUS twice in four years?

                        I had a great conversation with a conservative yesterday. It was in the context of business, so we had to be circumspect, but as we each answered each other‚Äôs dog whistles, the conversation become more explicit.
Then he said, ‚Äúand Trump has delivered on every one of his promises!‚Äù I was thunderstruck, but didn‚Äôt think there was any point in arguing.
Some else on this site mentioned Anton‚Äôs (‚ÄúFlight 93 Election‚Äù) recent defense of voting for Trump. It‚Äôs quite persuasive.

He probably got it from Fox.  I saw Hannity use that exact line when he was interviewing Mike Pence the other day.  It must be a Conservative meme or something. The strategy being, since Trump has barely delivered on anything‚Ä¶say the opposite, and say it boldy.

                                Trump said that at a rally here in Ohio.  It‚Äôs hard to characterize it as a ‚Äúlie‚Äù since I think he honestly believes it himself.

                            Good article you linked to. One of Anton‚Äôs suggested Republican Party planks is a good example of how close a mainstream Right party in 2020 can get to conveying an anti-Pozz, anti-gay, anti-immigration stance, i.e. Buchanon‚Äôs ‚ÄúCulture War‚Äù speech. It‚Äôs well worded. And I guess as near a Republican convention speech can get to declaring SOMETHING that separates it culturally from the Left.Anton:‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the party that will defend our common ideas of decency, morality, and citizenship. We‚Äôre the party that stands in favor of you living and worshiping the way you always have, the way your sacred scripture says and your ancestors taught you. We stand against silly, destructive fads cooked up on university campuses and in big cities to alter and degrade your way of life‚Äîand to insult and belittle you in the process.‚Äù

        You mention that the odds are in favor of Clueless Joe assuming room temperature between now and Election Day.  Besides his senile dementia, the other reason they are keeping him in the basement is to reduce the risk of his dying of the Wuhan Death Cooties.And what if he does?  What does the Democratic Communist National Party do in that case?  Nominate the Hoe?  Nominate Bernie the Bolshevik?  The Commies are wargaming this out and if I didn‚Äôt hate those bastards so much I would sympathize with their situation.I‚Äôm assuming Trump is on a maintenance dose of hydroxychloroquine, so we are probably OK.

        Love your stuff.  But, please please please stop reading excerpts from articles written by other people.  I understand that it helps set up points you‚Äôd like to make, but I come to your website to read / hear what your have to say, not other people.A good analogy is, imagine you‚Äôre reading an article with hyper-links here and there embedded in the text where the author is citing some other article which supports or buttresses his point.  Now further imagine that, at every hyper-link, the remainder of the article is blacked out until the secondary, hyper-linked article is read.That‚Äôs how I process the diversions where you read material from other people ‚Äì being forced to read through a linked article before I can continue with my chosen article.  Also, your cadence and pronunciation are different when reading someone else‚Äôs work.  (e.g. pronouncing ‚Äúthe‚Äù as ‚Äúthee‚Äù) which upsets the rhythm and flow of the piece.Otherwise fantastic as usual.
