            Obama is leading that charge from behind. He told people that he wanted to bring fundamental change to the country. What he didn’t say was that his Commie ideas would ruin American society and tear apart the social fabric. His promotion of grievance mongering led to those Democracy-intoxicated mobs and mobettes that terrorized campuses, schools, downtowns and other public areas.Notably, his efforts didn’t find much traction when hetried to do that in a small town.His downfall will be shortly after Biden’s, as more veils get pierced, more whistleblowers come forth, more dirty deeds get exposed, more birth certificate stories gain traction.

                Mob influence is actually a function of the New Left, and as such came to the fore in the second half of the 60s. The Vietnam War protests, race riots and so-called “free speech movement” were mob phenomena writ large. This is just one further item of evidence demonstrating that something in America snapped ca. 1965 and the reverberations continue, in many of the same modalities, to this very day.

                    Obama is the key man only to a generation/group of people that has never stopped loving the idea of black Jesus. The similarity between Biden and Obama is that the same group of people control each man.They both want to be President in title without any desire to rule or get into the particulars of ruling. That want of the title is why Biden almost certainly will weather out the mob, unless the Clintons offer their solution.

                Obama is an actor like Biden. The same people who run Biden ran him. I just don’t get this talking point that somehow Mr. Golf is some sort of mad genius running the world. He never was.

        Kyle Rittenhouse had the right instincts, but his virtue was turned into a vice by clownworld.  He risked his life and freedom defending the property of pajeets thinking the pajeets were part of the community.  He did not understand the pajeets would throw him under the bus the second it became advantageous.  Worse, he thought his own life was worth more than that of a child molester and drug addicts.We need to reach young people like Kyle Rittenhouse and make sure they understand their community is mostly gone and redirect their efforts into better activities.  In better times, Rittenhouse would have grown up to be a backbone of the community.  The kind of guy who fills sandbags down at the river when a flood is expected.  Instead of being rewarded for trying to help his community, he’s been ruined because of it.

                Intentions aside, KR was extremely lucky and very naive.  He was untrained in tactics, the first rule of which is to have someone watch your back.  He never, ever should have voluntarily ventured into a combat situation (which means riot in his case) alone.  Let him be a lesson to *all* of us.  Train with a group, venture out if necessary as a group. An individual is just target practice in a mob situation—a group is a force to be reckoned with. A fire team can be as few as 3-4 individuals.  If you can’t muster that, stay home and protect the homestead.

Unfortunately today’s mob is not poor illiterate plebs, armed with pitch forks and torches. Todays mobs are filled with college educated people armed with smartphones who are well organized and well funded by people like George Soros.

        “The democracy fever that set in after the Cold War is now reaching its natural end point.”Democracy is now just a skin suit that the Oligarchs wear to bring legitimacy to Oligarchy. So the fever Zman refers to here is really just the growing need of the Regime to legitimize its depredations on the people. The less true democracy we have, the more they need to invoke its defense. The final stage will be the Regime just shedding the “democracy” skin suit and openly crushing dissent.

                You can have all the firearms and ammo in the world, but the refusal to use them renders it about as useful as 6 metric tons of used Kleenex.I am increasingly of the opinion that the Rulersrelyon firearm ownership to function as a security blanket, lulling the proles into quiescence as they reassure themselves with their Dirty Harry daydreams.Allowing people to own weapons is a stroke of genius, really. They will accept any outrage, suffer any tyranny, comply with any absurdity– then they will shake their fists and mutter amongst themselves about their stockpiles of weapons.Afterthatthey will pay their property tax and maintain 6 feet of distance and look the other way as their daughters are raped in the Free Speech Zones dictated by their Public Servants and grumble about propaganda while watching hoards of race mixers on TV erase their history and ruin their women.“Just one more straw and we’re bustin’ out ourgunson this camel, hoss!”Say what you want about our Rulers, their insight into the modern human is far more thorough than any of the opposition figures.

                    I think you’re absolutely right that gun ownership functions as a palliative. However, I don’t think that’s by design from on high. The yella-bellied, lily-livered faggots running the west are terrified of the brisket-fed Grillers and their personal arsenals and would like nothing better than to confiscate all the guns and ammo. They have not, however, figured out yet how to do it.

            Isn’t it odd how one of postmodernity’s hallmarks is “methinks they do protest too much”? Our Democracy incantations in lieu of genuine democracy is a great example. But so is virtue signaling one’s niceness. The more people prate on about how good and sweet they are–truly a discursive curse of the age–the nastier society becomes. The apposite symbol of this era is a smiley face with gore-enmired fangs superimposed over a flamethrower.

        Realistically they have until the end of next week to drag his corpse from the ticket. After that, the mob will run out of steam and the regime will run out of time to stage a fake process to name a replacement, so they will be stuck with Biden.It’s unclear why there’s a deadline so near. There’s no special reason why the kooks couldn’t kick him out much later. It’s not as if they’re constrained by rules or logic. Whoever takes his place would still receive more votes than any candidate in history, proving that the last-minute substitute would be the most popular president ever. It’s not inconceivable that Biden could be replacedafterthe election. There’s no time limit on this fake process.

            The reason for the deadline is that Biden isn’t going willingly.  Sure, if he was willing to step aside they could replace him at any point.  They could find a judge to order every ballot in America be reprinted two weeks before the election and that all early votes cast for Biden count for his replacement.  With Biden fighting it, it creates more problems for their corrupt process.

                That is the rub. In order to rig an election you need to have an election. Our rulers are so crooked and inept they can barely run an election with years of planning. There are warehouses of ballots with filled out for Biden that will have to be replaced. That takes time.

                    I’ll expand on your points with my belief that we have seen a precipitatous decline in the competence of TPTB and their toadies from 2020 to 2024.
I believe this is a factor in their apparent failures to launch Beer Flu and Summer of Love v2.0.
I also think this massive drop in general competence is also a reason TPTB are going to find election rigging far more difficult in 2024 compared to 2020.

                            Charles Y. Lazarus of Columbus (not the one on the east coast who founded Toys r Us) was a department store scion. The Lazarus family was instrumental in building the company today known as Macy’s Inc. (the old Federated Department Stores). Lazarus was a sharp guy and the family was well-liked and well-respected around here. (Nobody around here bitched about them like we bitch about the Jews on these kinds of comment boards.)He was interviewed some time ago by the Columbus Jewish Historical Society so they could get some of his recollections down on paper before he croaked. One of the things I remember him saying: “‘Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations?’ He’s found out to be completely true.”

                        I’ve occasionally proposed not only internet balloting but “fremiums” allowing you to cast extra votes for your candidate. The system would be only slightly more corrupt than the current one and would be self-funding. The result, complete dictatorship of the oligarchs, would be much more complete and consistent and would at least keep places like Baltimore, Atlanta, or Detroit from needing to be humored.

The real election is in December, there are 538 voters, and whichever party has a majority will instruct their electors to vote for whoever they want the second Monday in December.

                I don’t think it’s Joe that’s not going willingly. I doubt Joe knows what day it is and what he might’ve had for breakfast. It’s a matter of Jill, who refuses to give up power.
As for the mob, since they’re all partisans, they’d think nothing of breaking the law to put their preferred zombie on the ticket. Just like they have no qualms with stuffing ballot boxes or any other illegal activities to accomplish the goal of protecting “our democracy,” (Newspeak for their tyranny).

                    Lucid or not, Joe would never willingly resign.  Yes his family is pushing him to stay in, but he wants to do it as well.  Of course the Democrats would break the law to replace him, but they need time to come to a consensus replacement and sell that to their voters.

            They have to at least pretend they had some sort of process for selecting the new nominee, especially since it is clear they want no part of Kamala Harris. That takes time to engineer and they have less than six weeks to do it. My mat6h says they need a few weeks for the hopefuls to make the rounds and make their case to the media, donors and party hacks. Then the field will need a couple weeks to put together their convention campaign.The only reason to drive Biden off is his real numbers are so bad they may overwhelm the vote rigging machine. That means they need someone who has better numbers and that takes time.

                    Yep. This is the rub with the Democrats. The one thing they cannot have is a strong White man in charge. I think this even creates problems for Newsom. The black Caucus will not have it. I suspect inside the Democrats there are a lot of tribesmen with thought bubbles of: ‘Oy vey! Our junior partners are really tough to deal with. Let’s make some calls and figure out how we can do some bribes where when they spend it right away it goes back into our pockets.’They can’t have a strong White man, but they have the weakest possible, corrupt as hell White man and that is a problem too.I wonder how much this rhymes with Russia and Yeltsin in the 90s. It is the same people who stood up the drunk buffoon Yeltsin who stood up Biden. Putin played them good and hard. If Trump were serious he could do the same. I suspect he is just lining up everyone he can behind him and will take office with so many owed favors The Regime will steamroll what is left of the country and do more than they ever thought possible with Trump in charge.They will have to figure out how to weasel out of mass deportation, but that isn’t so difficult. Too bad. I wanted a front row seat for Mayorkas’ day of reckoning.

                The smart move for the regime Dems would be to realize the jig is up with Biden, let him run, and try to preserve the fiction that “nobody knew” to maintain some legitimacy.

            With the Ohio time limit coming up they need to declare a candidate or risk having to break the system to get their way.  It’s complicated for no other reason than regime toadies may figure that since “breaking” is officially on the menu that it’d be okay to break other things, i.e., they risk a cascade failure if they try to screw with it too much.

            A Trump victory will bring on the Summer of Floyd II on November 8th.  The mobs will be huge and the regime will stand aside and let it all burn.
In the sixties the Man would use teargas and truncheons on the mob.  Now-a-days the Man just lets it burn, grooving on Whitey’s civilization being destroyed.
The thing is, Joey Diapers will have responsibility for law and order until January 2025, so that mayhem will be on his watch, not Trumps.  That should be fun.

                Trump just disavowed P2025 for the second time. He has confirmed that “Nikki” Haley will get a job in his administration. He wants to staple green cards to diplomas. He supports endless genocide in Gaza and took Miriam Adelson’s $100 million. He’s talking about another corporate tax cut. This all adds up to one thing – Trump’s been brought into system. I am sure they offered him protection from prosecution and to stop going after his wealth in exchange for it.There would have been riots had Trump been declared the winner in 2020, because that’s how color revolutions work. But it is not going to happen now. I think that the media is going to spend the next few months turning down the temperature on the Trump hatred and prepping the shitlib base for his victory.

                    As I said a few days ago, either Trump will be barred from the anti-White House, one way or tuther, or he will be entirely emasculated and allowed to assume the presidency. You may be right that the latter scenario is now the more likely one.
Heads they win, tails we lose. Then again, it’s not as though the president is anything more than a symbol anyway.

        I’d like to see a serious “right wing” mob to deal with the antifa fags (for example) once and for all, but the best we ever seem get are truckers blocking roads and honking horns.  I mean I give them credit because they’re out actually doing something, but it needs to be a lot more intense than that.  Of course with the state willing to bring hammer down on them, it probably takes a little more thought…

                Proud boys are feds. All these “groups” you hear about are feds. Its not like they’re going door to door in neighborhoods and handing out flyers. Ya know, anything grass roots. They’re all feds.  Think about it:  Have you ever been involved in something small that became popular?  Or witnessed a band start small in your town and get big?  How did they do it?  Did success just appear over night, like barrack obama?  Like antifa? Like proud boys?  No, you would have heard about this new group who was shaking things up, when has that happened with regards to politics in your lifetime?  The tea party? Feds and stupid boomers trying to control discontent 😉

                    There are two Proud Boys in a NY prison right now serving 5 year terms.  They were attacked by antifa, kicked their asses in self defense, but no serious injuries.  They were hunted down by cops and prosecutors in NY for basically a street brawl and given harsh sentences.

If you read bad cattitude enough, he makes some good points, but he will never ever touch the financial system with a million foot pole.  Every problem we have is due to the financial system and the fact that criminals who will not hold themselves accountable when they bankrupt the country (that was what 2008 was, the debt didn’t liquidate because the debt is their power, instead it went on to the publics balance sheet to by them some more time).  Ask him about 2008 and see what he says.  Should answer your question for you.

                                Was 2020 a pandemic or an economic crisis they called a pandemic?  Look at the responses from governments, most of that crap was amped up 2008 response.  0% rates?  Oh yeah that is how you fight viruses!  QE(AKA buying .gov debt because they’d have to pay higher rates if the central bank didnt) helps fight viruses.  I still stand by my initial reaction to 2020, it was just the natural continuation of what 2008 was, except this time China and Russia told us they weren’t going to play ball.  So we got Covid instead and they mask that a war is going on for who is going to control the US government and its collapsing empire and who will be the leadership for the next stage of world history.

Left-wing mobs are allowed to operate with tacit government approval. “Right-wing” mobs are staged by the feds for propaganda purposes. In the rare instances where they are not they are ruthlessly infiltrated and crushed.

                Well, not if you don’t get caught. the essential failure of those guys is they did not imagine themselves to be criminals. They were thinking, “What would Jesus do?” when they should have been thinking, “What would Tony Soprano do?”
The next batch will not make that error.

                WN 1.0 figured this out decades ago.  The Alt Right re-learned the lesson the hard way in C-ville, although to be fair they did have a permit.
We may get to see how well the regime is able to handle small cells armed with the Columbine mentality in the event the US is drawn into a war against the Shias.

        But this mob is as fake and gay in what stokes it as the other mobs. Something changed inside the regime and the debate was a pretext. The memo went out and the mob got its permission to begin.I heard J. Bagby talking with Heywood the other day and apparently in 2021 another black was shot in Louisville. The story surfaced and things started heating up. Then the media went silent and there wasn’t a trace of the story.They whip up the mob when they need to.The legitimacy of The Regime is falling precipitously as more scales fall from eyes every day. It is hilarious to see Colbert and Stewart knives out on Biden. Same with George Clooney who apparently was raising vast sums for Biden just two weeks ago and is now calling for him to resign.That mob call The Black Caucus is no doubt putting Michelle in place as the replacement though apparently she has no interest.On the one hand the disgrace to all that was done before to get us to America by our ancestors is gargantuan. There are some good laughs, so let’s enjoy them. But, let’s also seethe with anger at the people who seek to humiliate us with this toxic dumpster fire.

        The other mob that is a delight to watch is the anti-Israel mob interrupting college commencements and even gay pride parades.
However, it is clear that even they have a certain degree of regime approval… the same DA who charged Trump with 34 bogus felonies dropped the charges against the mob who seized a building at Columbia.
Nonetheless I am experiencing a bit of schadenfraude seeing the Left eat their own.

I’ve enjoyed seeing posts with pictures of Rainbow 🌈 Alphabet people holding up signs and banners stating “We Support Palestine!”.
All I can think of is “You DO know what Islamic people do to people like you in the Middle East,right?”

                    Maniac:  Whichraises an interesting issue for the future.  In Israel, as in the US, the boomers are aging out and dying off, and the whiter portion of the population is decreasing.  Half the photos of the ‘hostages’ look – to me – just as brown as their Arab ‘captors.’  Just as AINO’s support of Israel will shrink along with the soon-to-be majority non-White population, it’s interesting to speculate on how Israel’s browning will change things.  Jews in AINO are majority Ashkenazi, but they are also aging out and dying off.

            College students seem particularly susceptible to mob mentality.
I remember the college sexual assault numbers at the height of the scare – 25% or more of women were purportedly being assaulted.
Think about that.  What parent would send their daughter to a place where one in four women were being assaulted?
No one believed it.  But everyone had to pretend that they did..or else.
(real purpose was just to discourage and chase out young men…mission accomplished.)

                No. He will be on 5x the meth and he will do a really good job, which will lend credibility to his claim that it was just a bad night. His performance will be sufficient to justify not stepping aside.

                    30% of the victims of Parkinsons have no symptoms of shaking. I know well someone with this condition. Gait disturbance, short steps, arms do not swing, general rigidity, including the face. He has reached a stage where he becomes literally frozen while standing and has to be manually pushed ahead to break out of it. In his case the analytical brain is completely unaffected, while Biden has entered dementia. Parkinsons causes dementia in some and not in others. His may be entirely unrelated.Parkinsons can be treated in short bursts, and perhaps so to can Biden’s stage of dementia, but with different drugs that may not be particularly friendly to each other. A good night may be more challenging than you think.

                        Parkinsons by my very lay understanding is a destruction of the nervous system except the brain. Or rather it’s dead last, if it affects it all. Dementia is a different animal altogether, with it first showing up as brain disease.
I have been assuming the need to talk about Parkinson is the need to cover for Biden while trying to explain away his behavior. They are not going to talk about dementia at all. It’s sort of the media trying to quell it’s own mob. Biden may also have Parkinson’s, but the issue is with his mental state is dementia.

        I would much rather we were under “mob rule” than the fakest and gayest of all governments ever conceived: muh “representative” “republic”.I would rather we had no leaders than to have fake leaders beholden only to their paymasters (who’s true identities are kept hidden.)Mobs at least serve the interests of the mob. They respond to their interests immediately, instead of having to wait *years* between fake “elections” as the only way to address the needs of the people supposedly “served”.Lincoln warned that the mob is the antitheses of the rule of lawIf Lincoln is what “the rule of law” brings us, then by God give me the antitheses.

        “The mob chasing Biden is not thinking about what comes next. They can only think about the joy they will feel when Biden steps aside.”Boy, are they going to be disappointed. Supposedly Biden is telling the Democrats that if they remove him, he is going to tell the whole world, with documents to prove it, that Obamie is as queer as a three dollar bill, and “Michelle” is a well-endowed transy, just like the one Joan Rivers declared to the world, right before she died in a freak accident while sitting in the dentist’s chair.Joe Biden ain’t going anywhere, and the fraud to reinstall him will be so blatant that history will show it to be the official beginning of the end of the United States.

        The Black Caucus may be the barricade against which the mob breaks.  Joe Biden will not resign willingly; he has known nothing since public office since he was 30 and is not inclined to give it up, simply because he performs poorly; when was he ever any good?  Jill and Hunter have their own reasons for keeping hubby and Dad in office.  The removal will have to be involuntary, but the Black Caucus seems fully on board in support of Joe Biden. That Black Caucus support makes invocation of the 25th Amendment process unlikely to succeed, even if someone had the stomach to start it in the first place. Democrats simply cannot afford to alienate blacks.  To me this seems strange, since the logical successor, Vice President Kamala Harris identifies as black.  I suspect the Black Caucus realizes her attitudes are nearly 100% Brahmin arrogance.  In any event, as Z-man says, it’s enjoyable for a short time to watch our enemies tear at each other.

            Clyburn is one of those fossils leftover from the “civil rights” debacle of the 60’s. I saw him on an interview last week where the question was put to him regarding the younger black voters lining up for Trump. He was almost in a visible panic as he openly plead with older black voters to, “Make sure those young people understand what previous generations went through for them. Make sure they come back to the fold in November because we still have a long way to go.”TRANSLATION: I’ve spent my whole life screwing over Heritage White America and I haven’t finished yet.

        The tactical move here that most have missed is that Biden was wheeled into position in front of Trump as Public Enemy #1, at least for the time being.
This is a remarkable turn of events, considering where Trump was on January 21, 2021. We did not hear from him for over six months, I believe. And Trump has been very quiet lately as well, too. His TruthSocial ramblings do not reach 99.999% of people. He is keeping his mouth shut.
One wonders what the play is. Obviously they need all eyes and ire on Biden. Then what?

        The tens of millions of young military-age males that have been illegally imported into the USA/EU are the future foot soldiers of the mob cadre that will envelope Western societies with extreme violence, largely aimed at the weakest components of the citizenry. This is an optimum strategy of the Cloud People because it generates a fervor for Jackboot imposition of “good” tyranny. But the models say that this menace can be redirected toward the elites themselves using the same high-tech indoctrination and motivation techniques that they are now using against us. Is there any reason this should not be done? May the best man win.

            The most obvious thing about Our Regime is that it does not ever consider the consequences what it decides to do at any given moment.
Nobody in power is asking, “What happens next?” when one of their bright ideas pops up.

        “With any luck the Democratic convention is an even more chaotic replay of 1968.”
If they have the information chaos is in the cards and unavoidable, the convention will be canceled outright. This won’t be strategic or proactive but due to personal fear and cowardice. This isnot1968. This is the Covid Class and it is Be Safe 24/7.

        American antifa got its start in Minneapolis as the local punk scene police, suburban rich kid insiders beating up the normal guys drawn in by loud masculine rock music—which is fascism…if poor people like it. George Floyd becoming a superstar martyr had a significant “psychogeographical” aspect.In the ’90s antifa moved to Portland and Seattle in the luggage of migrant Minnesotans. And that’s where much of the rest of 2020—the media/propaganda event—happened, not coincidentally.The Great Awokening (or whatever) is the victory celebration of the takeover of institutional America by the late boomer/early X white urban “counterculture” (overculture with blue hair and feigned bisexuality).Remember the guy who was Hillary’s VP? I couldn’t name him at gunpoint, but I remember what qualified him for the office, according to my professional-class generational peers: His favorite band was The Replacements.

        Thinking a couple of days ago about a counterrevolution against democracy, I found myself saying people want leaders instead of managers. I don’t know too much about Classical democracy, so I wonder if managerialism is an innovation. Kind of like managing a herd of cattle, you can’t order a mob around, but you can fence them in, drive them, give them incentives. The thing is, people aren’t as docile as cattle, so maybe managerialism was unwise in the first place, even if it worked for a while.

            Digesting the idea that self government ≠ democracy. We get together to discuss and work out issues, an ancient and native practice. We vote, usually to pick our leaders, but sometimes in referenda, to formalize arrangements and make them legitimate. Too orderly and legal to be mob rule, so I guess it’s not democratic? Maybe I’m dense, the terms seem ill-defined lol.

        PlatoIn the oligarchical State drones are disqualified and driven from office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones.

        I think the media spent so much time lying over the years about what a good, decent, honorable man Joe Biden was, and how he stepped up to lead the country only in response to the horrible Orange Man, that they started to believe it. Hence why all the articles are framed the same way – “Joe Biden is such a good, decent, honorable man, who always put his country first, and he must do so again.” Except, of course, we all know that Joe was an affable and unintelligent crook with a thirst for power. He’s not going to give up power and his minyan isn’t going to, either. The one thing the minyan has been good at is playing power games behind the scenes and they have spent the past few years insulating themselves from these sorts of machinations.So, it will be interesting. Today George Clooney proclaimed that Biden is not Fit to Lead and the media is talking about it like Moses came down with the tablets.

            Prefacing one’s statement with “Joe is a decent man” is sort of like saying “I’m not a Trump supporter but” or “I believe in vaccines but” or “I’m not a racist but”. The point is to signal fealty to the Clouds lest one be mistaken for a Dirt (the #1 fear of any Cloud or aspiring cloud). It’s probably not necessary in this particular case, but the habit has become permanently ingrained.You don’t really hear the latter much anymore, there is no wiggle room left, one cannot break with Cloud orthodoxy on race at all, in any way, without being cast out. Or sodomy.

        I think trump has already got it.  As someone in here I think said, they need him to get whites back to loving the military. Trump will also be effective in selling pro-Israel positions as being patriotic.or put it this way, if trump gets in then I’d wager there is a 90% chance that america goes to war for Israel and puts boots on the ground in Lebanon or maybe in Iran.I don’t see how trump makes peace with Putin given the muh Russia crap they’re going to tar him with again.  He will probably load up his cabinet with warmongers anyway.long story short, Trump = American boots on the ground somewherehe’s the only one who could possibly sell a war to the “heritage” Americans.  I think they will rebel, but I don’t think that will stop (((them))) from trying

That was me and possibly others and a huge concern. I had intended to cast a vote for Trump as a no confidence vote over his prosecution but decided against it due to his possible use as a Judas Goat to lure young white men into the service of evil.
