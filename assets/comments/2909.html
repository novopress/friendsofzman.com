        If the US had a parliamentary system we would have seen a conservative partyturn out the lights of the Republican Party long ago. But it’s all too late now to vote our way out of this.

        Conservatives who vote for liberal Republican candidates against their own self-interest are no better than the large majority of African-Americans who vote reflexively for Democrats in every election.  I reject the notion coming from the Karl Rove types that I should vote for a Republican candidate who doesn’t share my views only because he is “Not a Democrat.”  If neither political party will govern the way I prefer, then I will vote for neither one.  Candidates who want my support must offer me something I want.  Karl Rove acts as if voting is a take it or leave it proposition.  He is mistaken; I will not vote for a Republican candidate only because he is the least worst option.

        You contradict yourself with the UKIP remark……and THAT’S A GOOD THING.
I would strongly suggest VOTING THIRD PARTY as a method of protest,as “not voting” leaves no clue to either the public or the political parties of, for lack of better terms, “disatisfaction.”
In your case, it may well be the only candidate running aside from (D) and (R) is some idiot LiberalTerrarian; in such case, I might understand but would still WRITE IN some desirable candidate.
