        Fed-Ex is a non-union employer. That might have something to do with it too.

        And by “stop” I mean UH, if these folks were “found guilty” in a timely manner, how did they conduct commerce?” “This indictment highlights the importance of holding corporations that knowingly enable illegal activity responsible for their role in aiding criminal behavior,” U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag in San Francisco said in a statement.”
Uh oh…doesn’t look good for the Justice Department, IRS, or Department of State.

        So “da gub’mint”, made arrests, based on “doing business with”,(or “failure to stop”) folks that “da gub’mint”, just can’t be bothered to make their case as illegal enough to “stop”(arrest)?Fed Ex. A neutral shipping company. Apparently with money, and a fixed address.Illegal Alien drug mules? Untouchable!But you see…..”It’s for the children.”

        Fed-Ex founder Fred Smith, current CEO James Barksdale. Anybody want to guess their political affiliations? Yup. Barksdale in particular is a hard core conservative. Maybe they need to get in touch with Gibson Guitar on how to deal with it.

        hmmm Looking at Yahoo finance, it appears the stock has not been adversely affected. FedEX is a huge business and as bad as this may seem on the outside, it’s probably going to have much impact which is why the stock hasn’t fallen. It’s like the Mc Donald’s coffee spill lawsuit, pay  small fine and some bad press and move on.

        Well, not Angola. That would be bad. Cruel and unusual. Maybe Huntsville, TX or San Quentin, CA.
