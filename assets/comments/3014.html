        I heard someone yesterday (might have been on Face the Nation) mention the percentages of popular support for traditional marriage. Then they went on to discuss how popular opinion had changed. So, why are they afraid of taking this to a vote? If everyone really is in favor of this, it should be changed by legislative means, not through activist courts. It truly requires mental gymnastics to come up with a way to say the Constitution supports gay marriage.

        As a newbie in the superannuation trustee industry, I asked why another man was being denied as the beneficiary of a deceased’s estate. Well, men will happily marry each other if it means gaining marriage status and protecting their private wealth. Oh yeah, I thought. I probably would be happy to trash the idea of marriage if it meant nobody could touch my business assets. Would a woman do the same? She probably wouldn’t. Lightbulb moment.I noticed that last month, two heterosexual men in New Zealand were happy to get married in order to win tickets to a rugby match.

        Let me tread where Ed fears to wander.It was a piece in The Atlantic, by two women, that self-identify as lesbians….
Meanwhile, the Catholic “Church” is figuring out how further accommodate it’s potential “members” that don’t practice “the basics”.
Everybody gets a certificate for mere attendance…

        “Liberal fanatics use the issue to segregate themselves from normal people.”
Not being “normal” is a key aspect of their common identity. If you can be considered normal then you are the problem; normal has always been the problem, always will be for those on the Left.
Moving forward, the question is, what will they be to the left *of*?

        This is one of those issues I normally avoid discussing, because there is simply no way to comment without sounding like an ass or an idiot, or both.
However, I do have to note that states, at least New York State, do indeed issue driver’s licenses to people that can’t drive, for use as IDs.  They do not allow people to drive, but sort of look like “normal” driver’s licenses, and come from the DMV, after completing the same forms used to apply for other types of licenses.

        Bruce Charlton-An increasing relative level of IQ brings with it a tendency to over-use general intelligence in problem-solving, and to over-ride those instinctive and spontaneous forms of evolved behaviour which could be termed common sense. Since evolved common sense usually produces the right answers in the social domain, this implies that, when it comes to solving social problems, the most intelligent people are more likely than those of average intelligence to have novel but silly ideas, and therefore to believe and behave maladaptively. This random silliness of the most intelligent people may be amplified to generate systematic wrongness when intellectuals are also advertising their own high intelligence in the context of a modern IQ meritocracy. The stratified context of communicating almost exclusively with others of similar intelligence generates opinions and behaviours among the highest IQ people which are not just lacking in common sense but also perverse.Yet, whatever else, to be a clever silly is a somewhat tragic state; because it entails being…. unable to engage directly and spontaneously with what most humans have traditionally regarded as social reality; disbarred from the common experience of humankind and instead cut-adrift on the surface of a glittering but shallow ocean of novelties: none of which can ever truly convince or satisfy. It is to be alienated from the world; and to find no stable meaning of life that is solidly underpinned by emotional conviction. Little wonder, perhaps, that clever sillies choose sub-replacement reproduction.

        I am not a big fan of the idea of same-sex marriage probably because in my heart of hearts I think marriage is a union of opposites, for some reason. I am not sure if I was ever taught that or just arrived at that idea all on my own. To me, you can’t marry something that is the same. Maybe it should be called ‘conjoining’ but that defeats the purpose of the modification (or corruption) of language and ideas, the aim of which as we all know has become the Holy Grail of the progressives.Someone once said if a gay man wants to marry then they have to swallow hard and accept they will have to marry a woman. What they do thereafter, of course, is up to them.I did know someone who went to a lesbian wedding, and had spoken to one of the ‘brides’ (a woman he worked with.) She apparently said she liked the idea of it because while she was once married to a man, and divorced him, she had never been married to a woman before.I suppose then we could all say things like that, because for all of us there are a whole lot of things we have never done and perhaps have no interest in doing. But, it appealed to this woman.
