        Few days behind, but wanted to say thanks for everything Mr. Z. Your insights are about the only thing I read seriously anymore about current events, and it helps keep me just in-the-loop enough that I have something to say when I‚Äôm out in public.Your topics have made it onto my own show plenty of times, an elder‚Äôs perspective is something sorely lacking from the younger side that wants to always be *doing* something rather than planning the right moves, so I hope that you‚Äôll keep at this for many years to come.Let me know if you ever want to come in, me and the co-host are a bit freeform but I‚Äôm sure we could have a good conversation. Either way, may the Christmas spirit stay with you into 2022, and blessings from the Great American Houseboat.

        Merry Christmas Z Man.  Your dirt people/cloud people thing blew me away, even before the kosher nostra introduced the jab juice.  You hit the nail on the head, instead of leaving elephant prints around the nail. You and your commentors always teach me something, always. You‚Äôre like a magnet for common sense. Rock on motherfucker, bring the pain‚Ä¶the world needs to see behind what‚Äôs behind the Potemtkin stage set.

            Just got back to Bradenton from Anna Maria Island. What a wonderful, warm, pleasant Christmas on the beach. I have to head back to the Northeast next week and join the fight against Covid with the rest of the troops in Parkas. The Sun King is doing a statewide hospital tour counting what few empty beds are left while howling for all to get the jab.

        I strongly encourage your updating and the intent to remain independent.I‚Äôm pleased to hear you wish to keep publishing in-house. Given the pervasive censorship that exists, any major publisher or content provider that would have you as a client is not worthy of your output.  üòÅThe only advice I have to offer is to plan one step ahead. What, if any, contingency plans can you make if your present server or internet service is terminated, presumably for ‚Äúundisclosed‚Äù reasons? Can you set up a mirror in a neutral foreign nation? There‚Äôs only so much one can do however. We already live in a world of censorship of the internet (e.g. China). To my knowledge, the USA and the West are still relatively free in the flow of information. But national or international bodies could easily close the spigot if they wish.

        I would love it if your premium audio content, currently on Subscribe Star, could be provided via an RSS feed just like your free podcast. I like to listen to all audio podcasts through my same podcast app, PodCruncher, to which I have added your current free podcast RSS Feed. I would love to add a second RSS feed to PodCruncher for the premium audio that I currently have to switch over to Subscribe Star to listen to. For the premium content, you could provide a password protected second RSS feed. Some other podcasters do that.  I could sign up for the premium content on your new website which would then send me an RSS feed link and a password via email. I can enter that RSS feed and the password into PodCruncher and then have a consolidated playlist with both of your audio casts. One free and the other premium.

        Reflecting back over the past these past 3 years on this side.Three central ideas have have stuck out in my head, and they came spaced three years apart.2019 was my year of the spiteful mutant. It compelled to take a different look into why antifa are what they are, what motivates them, what defeating them means. And this goes along with a certain variety of liberal, that these people are not just misled and propagandized. Some people can‚Äôt be saved, they don‚Äôt want to and they pop up in history. not just today.2020 was the year where Christianity openly revealed itself  to me as mutating into the paradigm we call wokeness. The Christian overtones of the Floyd riots were undeniable. I had rejected christian critiques of slave morality or universalism, there were counter examples after all,  SA or the south. But the washing of feet, mass cult like struggle sessions, and  iconoclasm of ‚Äúpagan‚Äù (White) displays took me aback. So many parallels:  White supremacy ~demons, White privilege~original sin,  floyd~jesus , universities~churches, diversity officer/professor~priests, blacks~god, diversity~good, Whiteness~sin,  colonialism~ paradise lost.If Christianity‚Äôs structures can be hacked into such destructive tendencies. Or if it facilitates the type of person attracted to this‚Ä¶The idea for this year came at the end  and its a rejection of conventional politics, infiltration, and Caeserism. You need a vanguard to draw from and that vanguard needs to organize in some way and be ideologically firm. No individual can stand alone and no amount of persuasion can work on its own.Trump looked at from the best intentions, had to hire conservative men from the Heritage Foundation, AEI, Cato, and the Republican party.  Is it any wonder that Trump devolved into a black identity supporter, toting reparations, low taxes, and fight against the klanocrats?  His entire apparatus was filled by conservatives, and they would never allow him to stray from what they wanted.We need something. A wacko Claremont lincolnite or another token dumb breitbarter  is a step backwards. There needs to be some organized ideologues.

        I‚Äôm asking Santa for an online Z university.Short, practical guides as to the technical end of server, blog, vid, payment processing, pitching/selling the topic, etc.Well worth paying for, hint hint.I want an alternate academic economy, with Gab U, Zman U, WRSA U, prepper U, local politics U, NGO U, our own doctoring U,  blog builder U, etc.Youtube and Tiktok‚Äôs great strength are their ‚ÄúHow To‚Äù libraries.  We have a ton of information professionals here, I‚Äôd like to see them develop channels to explore their own pursuits, beginning with the How2 of building such channels, creating such content, and contributing to each other.Island redoubts or pirate havens, sell me the course on putting them together.Thanks and Merry Christmas!

        ‚ÄúIn fact, it is usually from academics that I hear the compliments about the comment section. They like reading smart people confirm their private thoughts.‚Äú
Exactly‚Äîand I‚Äôm one of them. Best comments on the RightWeb, anywhere. I come here to learn from Z and the commenters both. I hear more sharp thinking here than I did in all those seminars through three graduate degrees.
Then again, Humanities doctoral-level seminars aren‚Äôt exactly setting a very high standard of thought.

        Merry Christmas Zman! I hope the next year will bring greater successes and that your relocation will go smoothly.I think the message board for subscribers would be pretty awesome. We could discuss topics without having to have them tied to a specific post of yours. We could also bring up our own topics. Just be sure that if photos are permitted, that the forum automatically strips all the exif data out of them. I generally do that myself before posting anything but not everyone is as careful.It would be nice if when commenting on an article that should someone reply to my comment I get an email notification. Right now whenever I post and I want to see replies I have to come back later, hit ctrl-f and look up my name.Oh, one more thing. Please, whatever you do don‚Äôt sell your new book on Amazog. I deleted my account with them and want nothing to do with them anymore.

        I signed up well before you had extra paid content and I tend to believe that if all content were free you would have similar numbers of paying readers. Granted your motive was to acknowledge those readers with extra content, but i expect your supporters think as I do, the gratitude is all ours. Everything should be out there. If, if it doesn‚Äôt cost you money.Putting a green sticker by every handle that pays would acknowledge support a great deal more than paywall content and give me a fine sense of undeserved satisfaction by gently shaming the slackers.

        For the new site, I‚Äôd recommend a Ruby based CMS. PHP in my opinion just seems to encourage the worst programming habits, and the Rails framework is very well developed, understood, if you do things the Rails way things ‚Äújust work.‚ÄùRefinery seems pretty good, it runs on Rails, you can use your choice of databases: MySQL, Postgresql, etc. Comfortable Mexican Sofa seems OK too. I would stay away from the Freemium models as they will cut you off as soon as they see your content. Don‚Äôt host on AWS ‚Äî they screwed over the Parler guys. Look at European hosting,

        I have a suggestion. Could you set up your own payment system for your content such that people could send you cash checks or money orders on an annual basis for access to content. Some people do. Of want recurring payments on their Credit cards. And you would not have to share with subscription services.

        As long as you‚Äôre revamping some things, I‚Äôd like to suggest naming each ‚ÄúSunday Thoughts‚Äù podcast in such a way as to differentiate it from the others. For example, rather than naming the MPG of every episode ‚ÄúSunday Thoughts‚Äù, you could use a name like ‚ÄúSunday Thoughts-12/25/21‚Äù (or whatever).I‚Äôm suggesting this because when I‚Äôm ready to listen, I download the MPG files onto an external audio player (an old IPod Shuffle) and get stuff done while I listen. This works great for a single ‚ÄúSunday Thoughts‚Äù episode. But when I try to download two different ‚ÄúSunday Thoughts‚Äù onto the same IPod, the player always tries to replace the first audio file with the second audio file because their files names are the same. I‚Äôve tried renaming the files, but for whatever reason, this doesn‚Äôt help. (Maybe operator error, heh.)Anyway, thanks for all you do, and Merry Christmas!

        Merry Christmas, Z-Man, and to all the erudite commenters who do your site proud.  I seldom comment ‚Äì just not up to the competition, but I generally read all of them from top to bottom.  Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm auditing a college history course.  Kudos to all your content, and I look forward with great anticipation to 2022, the changes you will bring and the stories of your odyssey beyond Lagos.  Best wishes to you, one and all for a Happy, healthy and prosperous New Year.

        Site has been one of the gamechangers in my political evolution, opening me up to a world of acceptance for the bad thoughts I truly felt alone in having.  Appreciate all you do and love the comment section.  Looking forward to 2022 here on this side of the divide.

        Only thing I would suggest is making sure the podcast hosting allows for easy downloads, I tend to download the podcast and listening to it when walking or something. I like a subscriber only section of the forum, I always feel kind of bad that a lot of good material is hidden behind the greendoor as much of it is very good stuff.

        Happy Christmas Zed man. fun and interesting time yesterday. I heard Ed talking to paul G. A few weeks ago, thought he was much older. Thank god he‚Äôs not, longer shelf life. Checking out some of his stuff this weekend. A real madman across the water. My people actually. Well off to wash my trousers for the big dinner tomorrow. I don‚Äôt know if I would make it in L.A. without the blog, podcast, and community here. Only comment, do away with the likes/ dislikes. I know that‚Äôs not popular but to me it‚Äôs right up there with Amazon and secretly hiring little brown men to cut your lawn.

            I respectfully disagree about the likes/dislikes. When I‚Äôm short of time, it‚Äôs really helpful to zoom in on whatever comments have the most likes or dislikes, because those comments tend to be the most interesting.
The likes/dislike feature also helps readers gauge how their own views line up with others on the dissident right.

            I love the likes/dislikes.  As Darcy points out, it helps prioritize, but it also helps to get feedback on my comments.  I have gotten zinged a few times, and it helps tighten my thinking.
My only request would be to add a sort feature for most liked/newest/oldest.  The comments used to have this before the plugin broke, and it is extremely useful when I start reading the comments late in the day, and only want to see the highest rated.

        Looking forward to the book. I hope you can make an audible version available as soon as the print version is out. That will be very important, especially to younger people who don‚Äôt seem to do much actual reading. At least you know you already have a competent narrator lined up for it.
I was red-pilled around 1980 by the Wilmot Robertson book, The Dispossessed Majority. It was a dramatic eye-opener, at least for people looking to have their eyes opened. I hope your book will do the same for some in the younger generations.

        Merry Christmas to the best dissident right site and commenters on the ‚Äònet.  All your ideas sound great to me, Zman, so please accept my wishes of good fortune and high energy for so many new undertakings.  Even when we disagree, we can respect one another‚Äôs views and not be banned for bringing up one subject or another ‚Äì thank you for your forbearance, as always.  I‚Äôve also responded to a couple of old friends below, one (awaiting moderation) regarding resources for your relocation.  The other suggestion would be to enable gift memberships please, so that those of us who may be blessed with sufficient resources can at least help old friends here who may be suffering due to various regime regulations and life‚Äôs general challenges.A bit early, but to all:‚ô´ Christ the Lord was born today, Hallelujah!

        I‚Äôd be curious about the business end of it. Obviously you don‚Äôt want to give away your personal numbers but I‚Äôd be curious to see percentages: of X total revenue, Y% came from the podcast, etc.
Because i suspect most things about blog commerce are BS and I‚Äôd love to see some real numbers. I suspect there‚Äôs lots of $ to be made even now, but not in the ‚Äúclick bait ad dollars chase‚Äù that others, not you, do.

            I think people are more likely to support if they know where it is going.  Now that significant support is rolling in ‚Ä¶ a couple of random ideas.  Travel fund.  Announce that the zfund covered  expenses for travel to xyx conference. This would lead naturally into a essay on the-goings-on.  Rent a cabin at amren and host a party/zsubconfernce.   Create an Zdissident award to support a young exemplary dissident activist.  I‚Äôve noted that Z gives generous super chats on occasion. This would have the extra benefit of cementing loyalty and the goodwill of the up and comers. Another idea is to designate a month exclusively to dissident activity sponsored by readership.  Maybe expand it as support grows or fund a dissident ‚Äúsabbatical‚Äù for yourself.  Finally, consider hiring help.  This overhaul is long overdue because you snowed in work.  Heck, pay a college student a couple hundred bucks.  Interns? A secretary, agent?Concerning commentating.  Bringing back Editing will be great.  Consider going back to telegram.  Develop trusted lieutenants to help you moderate.  The chat function on telegram is powerful.  Meme and video posting is also fun.  My, admittedly uninformed, impression is that Z doesn‚Äôt like to delegate.  However, there is no apparent reason that Z shouldn‚Äôt be as big as NRO.  More, better content than those clowns.

        First, Merry Christmas to Z and the commenters here. It has been a pleasure to watch Z come into his own as a writer; his thinking always has topnotch, as evidenced by the stellar interview with Dutton. The comments here always include at least a few that make me think and sometimes even reconsider long-held premises. There are few places that can prompt the latter.It is obvious free speech in the United States is near dead. I totally lack the skillset to offer suggestions, but the ever-looming possibility of deplatforming requires precautions to take that possibility into account. Archive everything. Hopefully this does not become an issue, but something you mentioned on the Dutton podcast also has me quite concerned. The biggest immediate Black Pill looming out there is the psychopaths in charge could bumble us into a war with Russia. Reading for entertainment, if such a horrible thing happened, probably would be far down the list of things to do, but if afterwards a point came where we could again it would be nice to be able to return to the places we enjoyed and to refresh ourselves.As for marketing suggestions, consider bundling subscriptions to here with your book, a buy one, get one free sort of thing. There may be tax or technical implications I don‚Äôt or cannot see, but why not?Off now to enjoy the holiday.

                A war with Russia would be another ‚ÄúBrother War‚Äù which the West really needs to avoid.
However I have morbidly though war with China might work out to the benefit for our civilization even if it makes the rest of my life a living hell.
A nuclear conflict with the Chinese would destroy the  ascendancy of our greatest racial competitor.  They would retaliate by nuking our cities getting rid of the Shitlibs and urban Brown.
Hopefully the rural population of the states and Europe would survive (assuming the conflict is limited to China vs USA).

                    The problem with a strategic exchange is that I wouldn‚Äôt trust the US to successfully cripple the Chinese and they‚Äôd invade before the surviving rural population can get society organized again.

            Agreed. Imagine an off line archived version of everything that‚Äôs ever appeared on this website, perhaps in a variety of formats, readable on a PC, Mac or even as ebooks. Data storage is already cheap enough that a flash drive can easily hold the equivalent of tens or hundreds of thousands of books, or several lifetime‚Äôs Z‚Äôs writings and the replies of his readers, perhaps with the entire archive of (say) The Unz Review thrown in for good measure.Realistically, the device would be many gigabytes, perhaps terabytes, of data, and unsuited for downloading, or perhaps even searching, online. A physical device is essential.Disadvantages: not easily updated, low profit item, in fact, I would make it free to share for non-commercial gain. Since most or all of the data is presently available on his on-line archives, I see no reason Z would worry about loss of rights or future publishing.Advantages: difficult to impossible for central government to control.In a dark future, all internet intercourse might be cut off. A circulating archive of dissident thought might be the 21st century equivalent of samizdat literature.

        Don‚Äôt forget about Greg Johnson over at Counter-Currents if you want a respected dissident publisher to help you get your book printed. I know you have had a cordial relationship with their outfit.
I realize I‚Äôm not saying something you don‚Äôt already know. There might be valid reasons to not use his company, idk.

                    As much as I‚Äôd like to support this publisher, I‚Äôd never buy from them again.I supported their campaign for the Junior Classics and have yet to receive a single book in spite of paying over $300 for the collection over two years ago. Like many others, I‚Äôve emailed. I‚Äôve posted questions to the fundraising site. I‚Äôve followed up. But I‚Äôve received no answer, no refund, and no updates for at least a year in spite of providing my shipping address and all other requested information.Judging from comments on the fundraising page, I‚Äôm not alone. In the meantime, this publisher is selling these very same books on Amazon even as they don‚Äôt deliver the books to those who have already paid.I admire much of what Castalia House does, but if the company can‚Äôt fulfill simple orders or provide a good explanation why their orders aren‚Äôt fulfilled, they don‚Äôt deserve continued support.

                        It‚Äôs another insult to realize you can get the entire set in the original 1918 edition on Amazon for less than Castalia is charging for a set for which only the first three books exist and nothing has been said about additional volumes for a year.

        I think the competition is going to start to show up, Z. There‚Äôs a lot of smart cookies out there that can write, and more than a few have had the Red Pill. I think the old ‚Äòmanosphere‚Äô did the same. It started out, dominated by a few key players‚Ä¶ and then everyone was clued in on the new sexual reality and they had nothing to write about. You‚Äôre somewhat better positioned than they were, but the dissident mindset has caught on. For me, I will forever remain the obsolete Yesterday Man ‚Äì proudly watching you kids grow and making your own futures.I am not very good with tech, and just learned how to do podcasts on the cell phone a couple months back. Your stuff was on there, but most of your icky ideological brethren were not. All I could get for the most part were the Ben Shapiro types and other controlled talking heads. It makes me realize how special your work is.I am prematurely retired, don‚Äôt have money to throw around anymore, and am not tech savvy. Old age is catching up to me fast these days. If I lose track of you in the shuffle ‚Äì all the best! I hope you make a million bucks, and that you become the straw that breaks the Establishment‚Äôs back.

        First of all, Merry Christmas and continued success in the New Year!Clearly, hard work is a hallmark of your efforts and it shows. That distinguishing characteristic is perhaps a key common denominator that unites us all. And it‚Äôs also likely to be a necessary ingredient in any future activities if we are indeed going to work our way out of the mess we‚Äôre in. Perhaps you can do a post highlighting some of the other common denominators that seem to characterize the dissident right archetype.As for me, I have been banned on numerous mainstream and fringe sites for expressing my candid opinions (hello Scott Alexander), and I suspect the same is true of many others here. No one wants to admit it, but free speech is on life support here in the USA.I‚Äôll close with my typical obtuse esoterica. Intelligence is not a state-of-mind abstraction, it can only exist as a manifestation of tangible action. And all wisdom is ancient and enduring. We were built to move with purpose. That is the seminal heritage bequeathed to us by our forebears.

        I know you‚Äôre not the biggest shill for donations and you can‚Äôt whore yourself out to advertisers (Ben Shapiro stops to say a prayer to Shari‚Äôs Berries and Legal Zoom every time he enters synagogue), but you should still run a separate fundraiser to build yourself a little studio for whenever you leave Lagos. That way you can set up a nice bunker in the house for broadcasting when you get to wherever you‚Äôre going. Soundproof her and get one of those comfy chairs that looks like a spaceship cockpit, so that your back doesn‚Äôt get sore when you switch to doing this stuff full-time.Bombproof her too, just in case Merrick Garland‚Äôs transgender drone pilots triangulate your signal. We‚Äôre taking no chances around here this year, using only inflatable nativity scenes. Any overwatch squads spot our unapproved displays (ADL has deemed them anti-Semitic) we can deflate them before being spotted, pop smoke, and retreat into our Honkey Cong underground tunnel complexes.

        Unz-dot-com has, in my experience, the best-organized comments section. One, it allows direct-reply to other comments; two, its direct-reply method eliminates the awkward, time-devouring, indented-to-maddening-infinity tangle of ‚Äúthreading‚Äù; three, its feature of ‚ÄúNew Comments,‚Äù distinguished by blue hypertext, allows the visitor to skip the comments that the visitor had already read at an earlier site visit; four, its ‚Äúmouse-hover‚Äù feature that allows the visitor to bring up replies and other comments is a tremendous time-saver. Further, that comment system allows visitors to stay logged-in with a dissident-friendly phony e-mail address.Good luck, Z Man, with your 2022 endeavors, and Merry Christmas to you and to all your site visitors!

            Unz is a fascinating site, one of the best I frequent, although I confess there are probably many sites I‚Äôve never browsed.Unz remains one of the richest sources of ‚Äúsuppressed‚Äù thought, whether current events or history. Unz the man is a strange egg: How many Harvard-educated, wealthy American Jews of European roots, host a website that treats Holocaust Denial or Revisionism and sundry other taboo topics? If you dig a bit deeper, his site is (of course) banned many places, but as far as I‚Äôve seen, he rarely if ever is attacked or even mentioned by the mass media. They like to pretend he doesn‚Äôt exist. üòÄIt may all be a Mossad or other agency‚Äôs honeypot to collect intelligence on the dissidents, but it remains a rich source of information for those of us who would dare to date Julia, hang out in the woods or the rented room, and discuss Wrongthink.

            I‚Äôll second the recommendation regarding Skousen‚Äôs book, ‚ÄòStrategic Relocation.‚ÄôThis volume is packed with a wealth of practical information.I only have a few significant disagreements with Skousen.One is his theory of how the geopolitical mess is going to play out. That‚Äôs not hugely important since accurately predicting that is impossible.The second is the effect of cold climates on refugees streaming out of the cities, especially large northern metros like Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit. I think those streams are more likely to head south than north due to climate considerations.Third, and most importantly are water resources. His most highly recommended states are out West and we already know that water resources in the West are under strain. Those states also have rainwater collection restrictions, though they do not seem overly onerous at this time:https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/states-where-it-is-illegal-to-collect-rainwaterThen again, who‚Äôs to say that more regulations won‚Äôt be piled on the existing ones?Anyway, other than these minor disagreements, the book has a lot of good information in one place, including overviews of firearms restrictions, homeschooling, tax burdens, etc.The nuclear war target maps are a unique feature, though I feel that some important civilian infrastructure has been left off them like power plants, ports, airports, rail hubs, etc.

                For Zman:  Another resource re relocating:  Talk to existing homesteaders.  No, many of them are not White nationalists and some of them cannot even be considered ‚Äòpreppers,‚Äô but by lifestyle choice alone they support the White race.  From my watching and reading, they routinely meet up with one another, support one another in building projects (like the Amish barn crews), and offer suggestions and other help and encouragement.  For anyone moving from urban/suburban to more rural, they‚Äôre an amazing resource.I agree with Wild Geese that Skousen, like others, heavily pushes the Pacific northwest (the ‚Äòredoubt‚Äô).  In addition to limited water resources and some of those states‚Äô already existing water and land regulations (particularly Colorado and Utah), they are now under enormous financial pressure due to an influx of Californians.  Population movement is a critical factor to keep track of.  Make full use of SchoolDigger to track school-age population ‚Äì if numbers are increasing overall along with the non-White share, that‚Äôs a dangerous indication of who is moving into an area that should thus be avoided.While state is certainly an important consideration, I would strongly suggest thinking more regionally.  Certainly taxes and firearms laws are important, but parts of Western Pennsylvania are far closer geographically and culturally to parts of West Virginia than to the hellholes of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.  Yet another vital future factor is that the regime has already considered (and has only temporarily put aside) the use of interstate travel restrictions  -something that will affect us all.  Either way, best of luck on what will be a huge undertaking.

                Howard,I agree about Skousen: though I agree with much of what he says, I don‚Äôt assume everything he says to be true.He seems to be convinced that he‚Äôs somehow privy to the Deep State‚Äôs game plan. And he seems quite certain that his ‚ÄòChina and Russia launch a combined EMP/nuclear attack on a deliberately-defenseless America‚Äô scenario will eventually happen, sooner or later.He regularly expresses the belief that God communicates truth to him through the voice of his conscience. I suspect that‚Äôs where his certainty on these issues comes from.That could be‚Ä¶. I have no way of judging that, as my spiritual beliefs are *quite* different from his, to put it mildly. When someone says, ‚ÄúGod told me‚Ä¶.‚Äù what can you say?And he tiptoes around the realities of race. He can‚Äôt quite bring himself to tell people to avoid large concentrations of joggers, though you know that‚Äôs what it amounts to.But I do appreciate his overall perspective on the possibility of drastic societal change, and his encouraging people to look ahead and ask themselves where they want to be living‚Äî or don‚Äôt want to be living‚Äî when/if the schumer truly hits the fan.And seeing how fast things have gotten crazy in America, with no sign of letting up, should be a wakeup call to all of us, about the foolish complacency of simply imagining that things are going to keep on as they always have been.Strategic Relocation helps folks start to look at that big picture, in ways they maybe haven‚Äôt before: to ask themselves: ‚ÄúWhere DO I want to be if things really do fall apart in a big way?‚ÄùI also subscribe to his weekly World Affairs Brief, have done so for about a decade now. It contains a lot of verifiable good information, in addition to his speculations. A unique perspective.And yeah, water is a big deal here in western CO where I live. The small town I live outside of has stopped selling water taps, and Delta County mandates a property size of 25 acres or more to drill a well; which severely limits development.Which isn‚Äôt a bad thing: I grew up outside of DC, and watched every single square foot of land I played on as a kid get transformed from woods and fields and farms, to condos and town houses and McMansions. I‚Äôm glad the same thing won‚Äôt be happening to the land around me.

I‚Äôm an old man so if you could increase the font size on your site that would be much appreciated. (Or, is that my browser? I‚Äôm so old I‚Äôm still lamenting the loss of Netscape.)
And definitely get off as many normie platforms as possible. Every time someone moves off those platforms and self-publishes, it‚Äôs a tiny little victory against the TPTB.

            That‚Äôs annoying though.  I always hate when sites use a registration or other way of getting an email address as an invitation to spam me.  Vdare has been spamming me for years. It‚Äôs like the roach motel, you can‚Äôt check out.  Hell, I still get 3 or 4 emails a day from Twitter.
