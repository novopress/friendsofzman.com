        One of the most bizarre things about all of this that I still can’t wrap my head around is that so many tens of millions of people have been wrong for so long, they have created an artificial reality for themselves.I always had a very basic, Ben Franklin understanding of this stuff. Buy low, sell high. Stay out of debt. Save money and compound interest. Don’t burn money on stupid shit, only spend it on things of value.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I had CDs that were 5-7%. There was not much money in them, but they were 100% guaranteed. My first opportunity to buy stocks came around 2007, when the DJIA was at an all-time high of about 14,000. I researched stocks and found that almost none of them were paying dividends that could beat CDs. The “market” appeared to be a Ponzi scheme to me. In 2001, I bought my first house. The realtors were pitching ARMs with 5-year balloon payments and teaser rates and refis and all sorts of crazy gimmicks to buy more house than I could afford. I opted for a 30-year fixed rate at a then-good rate of 7%.Then the market crashed in 2008-09, the mortgage scams collapsed, and I felt vindicated. The Fed instituted ZIRP so I paid off my mortgage, effectively paying myself 7% on the money.And then, to my surprise… they reinflated the bubble to six times what it was back then. The Dow went from 7,000 in 2009 to 45,000 last December. That’s INSANE. Meanwhile the debt went from $8 trillion to $36 trillion.There is no good way out. You cannot have tens of millions of people expect 10% annual gains (or more) forever and ever.A lot of people are going to get fucked. Unfortunately I feel like I got shafted by not getting in on the Ponzi and getting out early enough.As a dissenter, I have felt like the “sane man in an insane world — who thus appears to be insane.”Whatever this is, it is not “capitalism.” it is not the “rational and efficient allocation of capital.” It’s a completely rigged house of cards and when it collapses a lot of people are going to be in deep shit.

            Not “a lot of people” but the overwhelming vast majority.  Even the extremely rich will lose a large part of their paper money, though certainly not all and will still own the assets if they don’t need to sell them.  Everyone else will be royally screwed.  Shortage will be added to everyone’s lexicon. Shortages will cause real prices to go through the roof.

                It’s way better than that. We’re about to flood the job market with hundreds of thousands of government and government-adjacent workers who do not have ANY of the skills required in a modern manufacturing economy.For example, team Trump is now talking about using tariffs to eliminate income taxes for households earning less than $150K. Hardest hit? The 57 year old CPA who opened an HR Block brick and mortar franchise. And the small army of software people and tax experts who run the online versions.A ton of ex-military go into government adjacent jobs like contracting because that’s what they’re trained in. When those jobs go away we already know what happens. Homeless vets.All of these people will be mocked and condescended to like criminals and told “you should have learned to code” when everyone knows South Asians have been brought in to replace us.  People go into the jobs that are available to them in the economy the Wizards of Smart created.  New Wizards of Smart are “resetting” that economy.  When Treasury Secretary Bessent was asked by Tucker how it’ll turn out…he had no answer.Anyone over 50 in a non-trades, service industry job or government adjacent – about 60% of the country I would wager – should be alarmed.

            Well said.  I did fine with macro economics but had issues with micro economics.  So much made so little sense.  We had some mutual funds before kids, and then debt after kids.  Husband has suffered much angst over stocks not bought or sold with his 401k over the years, but that has been the extent of our involvement.  No longer in debt, but without extraneous cash to ‘invest in the market,’ I’m content to watch from afar.  I understand there is not enough precious metal in the world to back the economy today, but I trust the Jewish money-men financial legerdemain not at all.  Let it crash.

                Yep. Stay out of debt and put your cash in Treasuries. Guaranteed 4.25%, exempt from state taxes. Crack open a beer, get some popcorn and watch everyone else stampede and panic with fear and greed.
Dow up 2900 yesterday… down 1700 today.. LOL.

                    I don’t believe it’s possible (in the short to medium term) to regain the confidence that has been lost in the past week. Whether that’s intentional or not, I couldn’t say.

                        We never took the lumps from 2001.  They just keep reflating the bubble in different forms.  Kinda like cancer, if you don’t cut it out it spreads to the rest of the body.  Last chance to save the body was 2008, the cancer is everywhere now, including money.

                            With this I totally agree. At the time I didn’t understand the reflating that occurred after 2001. Now I do.

                    Couldn’t disagree more. 4% doesn’t keep up with inflation now. Wait till real inflation starts (worse than the 70’s). Your beer will cost you dear.Gold and silver is the ONLY protection.

Don’t burn money on stupid shit, only spend it on things of value.Two other supremely important axioms for those of us goyim who lack direct access to the free flow of Fiat Shekels from the Federal Reserve:A) Hoard dry-good-foods &amp; durable goods &amp; and similar long-term tangible [prepper] items prior to the onset of an inflationary cycle.B) Hoard cold hard cash prior to the onset of a deflationary cycle.It’s similar to what you poasted [Buy low, sell high], but it’s more like, “Buy low, and then buy even lower.”My vague recollection is that that used to be Karl Denninger’s philosophy; that you didn’t get rich because of what you sold; that, instead, you got rich because of what you PURCHASED.But you gotta purchase the correct widgets at precisely the correct points in time regarding the widget prices collapsing versus the widget prices soaring.Still, though, there’s always gotta be just a little bit of good luck involved in any sort of arbitrage; even the very best bargain hunters can get stung by the market from time to time.

            “when it collapses” is going to be a lot sooner than most people realize I think, after watch yesterday’s retardation.
Look up a list of the top ten biggest daily upward movements in the stock market, and then look at the years attached to them.
Look out below.

                    No, but the point is that perhaps “bottoms” are tested.  To affirm such you see these ups and downs level off in time.

            I think you’re too harsh on Normie.  We didn’t vote to have all our factories shipped overseas or to have an education system that doesn’t teach anything useful.  The Wizards of Smart build an economy around these things, and people went into jobs and careers because that is what was available to them.People who invested like you describe didn’t start doing so simply because the market never seems to lose.  They (we!) were all told Social Security was a ticking time bomb and we better start saving.  Enter IRAs and 401K’s.  It’s not so much that people expected 10%.  It’s that the flood of money into those accounts created a feedback loop.  The new “retirement investor class” votes.  And that money and its tax generating power required the government to protect it to prop itself up.But the thing nobody is talking about is essentially the complete re-education of American workers.  Trump talks about ship building, for example, or massive AI data centers.  Which of the fleet of Amazon delivery drivers is going to be doing that?

        There is a lot of truth in this post but we are not going to depart the fake world and enter a real one unless Jews are stripped of their control of the media and women can’t vote and control HR. While we hate the fake world, they thrive in it. For many women, if it feels real, it is real.Speaking of the tribe, Autotraker has a system that lets you trade like a politician. Their most famous is the Pelosi tracker. One of their most successful ones is the contra Cramer traker. They recommend the opposite of everything Cramer says to do. Last year the Cramer one was up something like 40 percent.

                    Z:“The primitive use of shiny bits of metal as currency only comes back if we enter a dark age.“Lately there’s been a lot of discussion about the 1-cent coin, the “penny”, with that horrible evil wretched wicked fellow from Illinois on its face.ButrecentlyI learned something fascinating; I was helping to clean out an old house filled with junk, and there were all sorts of pieces of metal in the house [old washing machines, old dryers, old toaster ovens, old metal furniture, etc etc etc].And I got to talking to the junk haulers, as to how much money they made when they sold the metal pieces to the scrap yard.And here’s the answer: Precisely $0.00 whatsoever.They even told me that ALL of garbage recycling is a scam; that the counties only continue the fig leaf of a “recycling” program so as to satisfy the emotional needs of the sh!tlib portion of the populace.That if the sh!tlibs found out that the“recycling” program was ackshually fake, then the sh!tlibs would all drop dead from massive heart attacks.The steel has no value. The aluminum has no value. The plastic has no value. The cardboard has no value [the USA cardboard treaty with China has long since expired]. None of it has any value, ergo the counties simply dig a deep pit [called a “landfill”], and they cover up all of those “recyclables” with soil, and the sh!tlibs live happily ever after, because of course the sh!tlibs are completely clueless lunatics.Apparently, for a decade or two now, and especially ever since it has been cheaper to simply order new stoves &amp; ovens &amp; microwaves &amp; toasters from China [rather than bother to fix and/or manufacture our native stoves &amp; ovens &amp; microwaves &amp; toasters here in the USA], and especially especially since the cardboard treaty expired, all of that stuff just gets plowed under the soil of the landfill.Now here’s the point of the diatribe: The only commodity which has any resale value whatsoever is COPPER.Copper can still be sold.Everything in our economy is switching to electricity &amp; electronics &amp; the cellphone gird &amp; the internet so quickly &amp; so furiously that we’re running out of Copper to keep the internet addicts from going cray-cray.If we ran out of Copper, and the internet &amp; the cellphone grid were to shut down [to include all of the iPh@gs], Cluster B would be in an helluva pickle.No Copper means no Dopamine Hits means Cluster B Thermonukular Homicidal Rage.tl;dr == If we upgraded the USA penny from copper-colored paint being spray-painted over pot metal, and instead put fully 100% copper into the penny, then the penny might ackshually be worth the better part of a dollar.

                            Dutchboy:“Auto recycling is still big. Any valuable parts are stripped and then the hulk that’s left is recycled for metals.“For cherished vehicles, such as, say, Ford or Dodge or Chevy pickup trucks, there’s definitely a need for “cosmetic” used sheet metal to apply after fender-benders.But most vehicles aren’t cherished anymore.Around here, as recently as 15 years ago, they would pay $500 to haul away your minivan or your SUV or your truck [for its cosmetic metal and certain other parts].But nowadays, the owner of the minivan or  the SUV or the truck has to pony up the $500 simply to get the broken vehicle towed to the landfill.In our local economy, we’ve experienced a complete inversion of the pricing structure.Where I live right now, scrap metal is a NET LOSS.You have to pay them to tow it away.

                        “That if the sh!tlibs found out that the “recycling” program was ackshually fake, then the sh!tlibs would all drop dead from massive heart attacks.”Not true.  Yes, the programs are “fake”, but in my burg it was revealed a few years ago that the recycling program by the County was costing several million dollars per year to pick through the recycle for basically aluminum and steel, then pack the rest up and send it to the landfill. The cost recovery of those recovered items was nil.So what happened?  Big yawn and the parade (charade) continues.  No, shitlibs never catch wise.  They are ideologues not subject to reason.

                        Every now and then I have to haul scrap steel/iron from the ranch to the metal recyclers near me and it’s not a lot of money, but I’m rarely hauling more than a ton. It’s been a few years but, I think last time I got enough to buy a decent lunch. That’s still way better than having to pay the landfill to take it.

I think all three of us are saying basically the same thing; that there is essentially no market for scrap metal whatsoever.

                    Last night I watched a YT short featuring the vile pedo-face Adam Schiff talking about how the Demoncrats were going to start an insider trading investigation of Trump because of his tweet saying to buy. He was literally smirking the whole time. Of course, “insider trading” is exactly the opposite. Giving away insider tips to the dirt people on a public forum is not what that means. Perhaps even Schiff knows this and was smirking because he knows the shitlib media will never call him out on it.I expect my NextDoor feed will now be full of the Karens cackling over their Necronomicons about how “we’ve got him now!”

                                So long as the underlying company still exists, or at least has attachable assets, the stock price will probably just drop to a “reasonable” P/E. Which puts those with a 401(k) ahead of those without. Those without will be demanding and getting government bailouts and handouts.
So the ROI on your Treasuries does what when tax revenue drops to essentially zero?

                            If the market goes to zero (or anything close to that) we’re talking essentially an apocalypse with a total collapse of productive activity (read: production and distribution of food and energy). We would be lucky if the numbers of dead in the usa had eight figures in that world.  A lot of you thinking gold bricks, treasuries, or CDs save you in this scenario are beyond delusional.I get the hatred of the elite and the shylocks but this kind of ideation is very near dreaming that every grocery store burn down because the CEO of the biggest chain is a jackass.  If that happened the CEO is still dramatically better off than you and has a world full of favors to call in and places to land.  You’re starving the next day and wondering why and who will help you.Need to mix a little dash of realism into the daydreaming here.  Much as the system sucks literally everyone here depends on it and needs a soft landing.  Unimaginable suffering on an unimaginable scale is doubly unimaginable and that’s apparently why people think it might be fun to experience.

                    They are worth something if you treat them as a share of a business that pays you dividends. I do that. I know many others who do the same. Market fluctuations don’t matter that much if you do this. Except when you want to buy more at a proper valuation.

                        Why do you think they kept rates at 0% as long as they did and Europe went negative?  2020 was financial crisis, isn’t it odd that the market flopped in the early 2000’s and we had another huge crisis?  I don’t think you really understand the people you’re up against and the lengths they’ll go to with regards to power.  2020 should have woken you up to it fully.

                                It’s not like nothing would exist without bailouts. I would still own my share of the businesses. Of course, you seem like you don’t know what you’re talking about and your view is determined by ideology.

You also didn’t answer my question.  Yeah they still might exist, and i might be able to afford a house.Yinz guys are like this and you wonder why younger people don’t support your beliefs:Kronos, also known as Cronus, is a figure from Greek mythology who swallowed his children to prevent a prophecy that one of them would overthrow him. This act symbolizes the destructive nature of time and the fear of losing power.

        In the 90s, when some contrary opinions were allowed on TV, there were some vigorous debates on NAFTA/free trade. At the time I was just learning the subject, but thought the protectionist (Buchanan, Perot, et al) side made sense.
One thing that struck me was the general arrogant and belittling demeanor of the free traders towards the protectionists. After all, the free traders and globalism were the glorious future, while the protectionists were thought of as frightened and stuck in the past, never mind the basic financial fundamentals.
As it’s said many times here, Pat Buchanan was right.

            The free traders were right, and still are. It’s mathematically provable, and dates back to Ricardo. But NAFTA was never about free trade. It was about managed trade. If you are going to have managed trade anyway, protectionism probably is better. But that’s just saying if you have to eat a shit sandwich, some shit is better than others..

                    Most people, including many who teach Econ, just don’t understand Ricardo. In another case of synchronicity, el gato malo explains it using basic, basic math. Nothing more than multiplication, and simple enough numbers that it can be done with just addition.

                        I don’t get how anyone could possibly downvote that. You believe it’s impossible to put a price tag on “Buy American”? Heck, idiots can figure it out. You just pay a little more. However much more you are willing to pay is how much you truly value “Buy American”, rather than how much you virtue signal it.
Denying reality is purely delusional. At best.

I agree 100%, no bailouts, no 0% rates 😉
As someone who was much more intelligent then either of us said:
Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up from less competent people.

Sounds good to me. Do you think you can get the young’uns to go along with 12+% mortgages, like with Voelker? Or are they going to insist on their bailouts?
Establishing things such that there were a realistic rate of return would be a major boon to the boomers and older X who have been diligently saving for the future. And utterly screw the blackpilled, who always figured there would be nothing for them, so they never bothered to save a thin dime.

                    Correct. I live 30 miles from the Canadian border. I have no problem with the fact that the engine in my truck was manufactured in Windsor, Ontario. The tax and wage and regulatory structure on both sides of the border are almost identical. In this scenario you can sell the truck in both the Canadian market (30 million) plus the American market (300 million) and have a market of 330 million. That’s free trade.On the other hand, closing a factory in the U.S. where workers are making $25, manufacturing the product in China with $2 labor, importing it and selling it here is not “free trade.” it is basically dumping.

                        Problem is, with open borders and massive ‘legal’ immigration, “US workers” and Canadian workers are just as likely to be blacks, Mexicans and Chinese.  Why I bought a used 4runner made in Japan.

                Yes. NAFTA was about carving out exemptions for MNCs to move unfinished products across borders to take advantage of Mexican labor rates without incurring tariffs. It was never truly “free trade.”

        Krugman is not just wrong about economics. That is the least of his problems. Krugman declared that America has a white ethnic problem and that whites, correctly understand that their power is going away. He declared that Whites are not the future, but that Bill de Blasio is the future. Bill de Blasio miscegenated with  a black and his children hate him and hate Whites.That aside, Z-Man alludes to the next real major battle. The media that is going to howl will be the pump network that fills the airwaves since the early 90s keeping boobus throwing money into the stock market. A lot of those people are White though increasingly less so since blacks are the new face of The Regime. Perhaps their anger can be turned against Krugman – who advocates for their genocide.It is great news that Bessent is pulling a reverse Clinton and telling the professional telemprompter reader class that they need to #learntodriveaforkliftOf course, that means watching a bot drive the forklift.

            Ironically, Krugman’s economics are pretty good. It’s his popular adaptations of economics that are horse-puckey. Papers and books and other professional publications he’s on pretty solid ground, particularly international finance. But the columns and tweets and whatnot? Pure, unadulterated socialist codswallop. It’s just what his readers believe, and want to see coming from an authority.

        I don’t think we have the social capital to make the sacrifices that need to be made. And why would we? The flooding of the 3rd world here has eroded any sort of bond we have as a people. Once their grills and F-150s double in price, Normie is going to turn on Trump and I just don’t see the guy having the guts to forge ahead. We’re in a bad place as a people, not enough want to forgo instant gratification for long-term health and we’ve grown too accustomed to cheap trinkets and endless credit. Collapse and ultimate separation is the only way ahead.

            Yep, you could be correct.  Here’s a personal example.  Last year I bought an EV—much to everyone’s horror and derision.  On the window of my Ford Mach-e was a required sticker stating the *value* and origin of foreign parts included in the EV.The sticker said, 51% of the value of my EV parts were *Chinese* in origin!  Now how does one get an ostensibly American car with 51% value Chinese?  Simple, it’s the damn battery made in China.Now a little math for those so disinclined here.  Say the build cost of the EV was $30k.  That means $15k+ went to China for the battery.  The replacement battery now costs with tariff, $34k or so.  That pretty much kills competitive EV production for Ford.  A big win for Tesla since Musk makes batteries here.I’m not choosing sides, just an example of ramifications from yesterday’s tariff actions.

                “A big win for Tesla since Musk makes batteries here.”Yes, in the immediate short term. But think about all those companies and countries who pledged to open facilities here in the states. Let’s stick with your numbers. A Tesla is $60k while EVs on the world market are around $40k. (In China and India, there are models around $15k.) Musk pulls in money because he’s catering to a higher price point, plus he gets all those carbon offset credits.Say that businesses left America because manufacturing cost (regulation, labor, litigation, the whole nine yards) was 10% cheaper overseas. So that $30k production cost would be $33k here. Maybe doesn’t seem like a lot, but multiply that by say a million cars per year and that $3k really starts adding up.But now add to that a 25% tariff. Manufacturing that car still cost $30k, but now the price in America is not $40k, but $50k. He still is making only $10k on his car, the US Gov gets the rest. To import more illegals aliens, probably.So what does a savvy foreign EV manufacturer do? He drops a few million to get shell built somewhere in the states, and puts all the equipment in his current plant on a ship to America. His production cost is greater, true, now $33k, but now he does not have to pay the tariff. The market for similar EVs is still $50k($40k+tariff), as global competition can’t undercut that, but now he gets to pocket the spread — $17k per car. Much better than the $10k he used to get. And he also gets paid the carbon offset credits.And if he can get some stupid jurisdiction to extend TIF or offer tax abatements to site the plant in their state, which he can, the taxpayer underwrites the whole kit ‘n’ caboodle.And what happens when the tariffs end? The equipment goes back on the ship.

                The only thing that matters is if white SAT scores have been declining over the last 60 years. If not, or if only marginally, the downward intelligence trend can be chalked up to dieversity.

                Note, when the standards decline to allow for increased minority participation, so to do those standards for Whites!  That is a dirty little secret we do not hear about.  Decreased standards affect everybody—Whites and minorities.  Yes, there are still pockets of predominantly White communities and their schools, but that has been in decline as the US demographics change over time.
People rise to the level of their challenge.  Reduce standards and the laggards increase.  There may still be distinctions among the races, but overall we deteriorate.

        Nothing exemplifies the fake economy better than Alan Greenspan, but he is practically forgotten today (and is still alive!). He used his position as head of the Fed to print money to protect bankers and industries from their own incompetence and shady dealings, but went in front of Congress and spoke a bunch of nonsense. However, he spoke nonsense in a very obtuse and jargon-filled way so the Congresspeople were afraid to call him out for fear of being called dumb by the media.This idiot was in charge of our economy for 19 years and did untold damage to it. It led right into the 2008 crash, which of course our government responded to in a very Greenspanian way.

                Mycale: “Nothing exemplifies the fake economy better than Alan Greenspan”Here I have to disagree, or, at least, here I have to confess that I’m looking at it from an entirely different angle.I am now firmly of the opinion that Black Tuesday of 1987 was a controlled Psy-Op, of precisely the same nature as 9-11 [and, to the extent that Benjamin NetanyahuTURNED OFFIron Dome beforehand, of the same nature as October 7th].There isn’t a doubt in my mind but that Black Tuesday &amp; 9-11 &amp; the 2008/2009 collapse&amp; October 7thwere all very highly coordinated psy-ops, painstakingly planned &amp; approved by the Council of the Sanhedrin.And in each instance, the Council of the Sanhedrin walked away vastly wealthier, and with great big sh!t-eating grins on their faces.

                        It’s a conspiracy ifA) They know with certainty that there is going to be a crash [so that they can purchase short options beforehand], or ifB) They know that Uncle Hymen Shekelstein in the Federal Reserve will be able to secretly wire several billion dollars to keep them afloat after the crash.That’s what they never teach you in Econ 101, that you don’t get rich from economic growth, but rather that you get rich from economicCOLLAPSE.Why do you thinkLarry Silverstein took out insurance policies on the Twin Towers?Because 9-11 was a very carefully choreographed fraud intentionally designed to enrich the fraudsters [i.e. after the twin towers crashed, Silverstein was sitting on both priceless real estate acreage AND two different insurance policy payouts].The Tribe always wins because we Christians are pathologically incapable of imagining the depths of the cynicism &amp; psychopathy &amp; sadism of the Bronze Age Death Cult.

        Reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode, “A Nice Place to Visit.” In this episode, a small-time hood named Rocky Valentine is gunned down by the cops after heisting a jewelry store. He is awakened by a portly, bearded bloke in a white suit who basically gives Valentine everything he desires–dames, money, a palace, the finest clothes, etc. Valentine also loves to gamble, and in this new afterlife, it turns out he cannot lose. Every spin of the roulette wheel gives him maximal returns. Every hand is a royal flush. The dice always come up 21.Valentine, thrilled to bits, is convinced he’s in heaven despite leading a life of crime and malefeasance. In short order, however, he becomes very, very bored. When it is impossible to lose or to fail, winning and success become dull and tedious. The lack of risk and accountability remove all of life’s tang. Valentine is driven out of skull. Then, in desperation, he informs his white-suited benefactor that he doesn’t think he belongs in heaven. Valentine asks to be taken to the “other place,” whereupon White Suit laughs uproariously and bellows, “My friend, thisisthe other place!”If Z is right, the plutocrats have been living in the other place for decades without knowing it and White Suit (Trump) has just delivered the bad news.“Is Rocky hot, or is Rocky hot?!”

My economic barometer is the cost of a quarter pound combo meal at a fast food restaurant. I remember when it used to be two or three dollars. Then it was five or six dollars. Now it’s pushing $10. In 10 years, a Wendy’s combo meal should be about $17.

                It recently was that much—if you didn’t have a Wendy’s account/app and a coupon and buy it during specific hours, etc.All together, as if they’re not in competition at all, the whole fast food business model shifted to each place taking its turn ripping you off and pissing you offonce, because who cares if you never come back if you left them $30+. They might not profit that much over a lifetime of treating you fairly. Add non-stop immigration forever, and it’s like an “infinite money glitch” in a video game.They’ve retreated a bit from that, I hear, but the big important step (progress!) was made: Young people consider you a loser if you think the app-coupon-restrictions shuffle is bullshit and expect to pay a decent normal price for anything. Anyone who doesn’tget with the programdeserves to be ripped off and laughed at for it.

That’s the only way.  However, the Fed budget must be brought into balance or the debt will go away via “default”, hyper inflation, and collapse of the monetary system.  The notable examples are Zimbabwe and Argentina, who have done this repeatedly and are economic basket cases because of such.

                You could have worse metrics, though those fast food price increases that have significantly outstripped inflation (and also wage bumps) are primarily from paying celebrities more for promo spots than their own CEOs and bloated app development budgets.

        I’m recalling a financial magazine article from the mid-90s from a doctor about the medical profession. He said no longer recommended his profession to young people. With the rising costs of insurance and other limitations on their income as well as the demands and costs of education, he told them they’d be much better off pursuing a career as a lawyer.

            One of the problems with the medical profession is that physicians are increasingly employed by corporations (e.g., HMOs) rather than being independent businessmen. The corporations call the tune and you obey or face the consequences. This was on full display during the Covid disaster. Physicians who would not play ball with the established protocols were persecuted, sanctioned, or fired.

        The Gamestop Affair, where the freaking FBI investigated kids for the crime of turning a profit and cutting into institutional short sellers’ (assume triple parenthesis) margin, for me marks the official end of the fraudulent inflated marker. Even though the story was quickly memoryholed, what happened did not escape the attention of foreign investors who wrongly assumed American markets were immune from the same shenanigans associated with China. And as an aside but related, it is probably wrong to assume Jim Cramer is merely a comical, perpetually wrong figure. The FBI or SEC or whatever never will visit him, of course.

        I am not an economist and am not qualified to give financial advice but I think the following are most likely true:1.  The value of the dollar relative to other currencies has little to do with tanglible goods, so that’s an unproductive way to think about it.  Otherwise, the ending of the petrodollar should have had more impact.  Dollars fill some odd roles – like simple scorekeeping among the rich for example.  They also are craved as a savings medium world wide.  I still want as many as I can get as well.2.  The worst doom scenarios are not going to happen, because the system is still a lot stronger than most of us want to accept.  Declining populations will help ease the resource burden, and a lot of waste (like feeding africans) remains to be jettisoned.  Most competent men still get up and go to work every day and hold shit together.  And much work was proved unimportant anyway by the Covid mess.3. If the worst does actually happen, most of the living will envy the dead.  Your self-sufficient homestead in the sticks better have layers of concertina wire and landmines to secure the perimeter.  You can plan for ‘hard times’ but not for disastrous ones.  So, don’t sweat it.  Just have a mental map of progtards’ houses in case you need to do your shopping door-to-door.4.  The biggest economic problem is how to make use of increasingly redundant humans, such that they don’t cause problems.  It’s true that the smart are not only in short supply but also misallocated.  But the supply of stupids seems inexhaustible.  How to keep them off the streets until sub-replacement reproduction fixes that?   Attempting reindustrialization might help.The current incoming changes will be interesting.  I hope they play out more positive than negative.

            The petrodollar tends to be a tad overrated. It’s only one tool in the toolbox of dollar hegemony, not the whole foundation of it. And any ending of it happens only by degrees, over a long period of time, not all at once like flipping a switch. As we have seen.

        Our government policy is currently oriented around rewarding the unproductive and penalizing the productive. Economists are wrong about a lot of stuff, but “you get less of what you tax and more of what you subsidize” is still true.

            There’s little evidence of that.But one true thing in economics, maybe the only true thing, is “information asymmetry.” Non-insiders don’t even know what incentives they’re subject to. By the time they get news of changes, it’s too late to alter their behavior. No preference is revealed when people can’t afford to do what they’d prefer and every exchange is fraud on at least one side. Shufflingnudgesaround doesn’t make anything happen when everyone’s constrained in a thousand other unknown ways.In such an economy, what does “productive” mean? The most comical welfare queen and Elon Musk alike have never worked a second in their lives, and the economy considers the non-labor of both highly valuable—and whatever you’re doingwrong. That’s why it takes your money and gives it to them.Losers are taxed and winners are subsidized. It’s axiomatic. What school of economics acknowledges it?

                Yanis is a media personality, he’s been in the spotlight since 2008 and i don’t take him seriously.  Controlled opposition in my opinion.  This guy is much better:

                    This guy is a nobody. Yanis being a known personality is kind of the point – he has an audience. And unlike most other leftists, he doesn’t end his analysis with “Trump is just a crazy buffoon”.

Anyway, this is way besides the point. I am not a leftist nor a fan of Yanis. I simply pointed out that he has an interesting perspective that goes outside of the usual leftist discourse.

            The process of de-dollarizing the world economy will take the rest of our lives. Zman will be right, but he and I might not live to see it play out. It would take 10 years alone to pay off or refinance all the Eurodollar debt in circulation. The financialization of the US economy took 50 years and the unraveling will probably take 50 years. If it happens quicker, it will be due to a Hunger Games collapse.

                It’s almost impossible to overstate the disorder and danger into which Israel, this dirty rotten empire, and resident stooges have plunged the indigenous people of Evrope, all the way from the Urals to the mouth of the Tagus. Nor is the task a small one if you expect the death merchants and Zionist dreamers to stop causing problems. A thirsty creedal empire like the USA is similar to Islam. There will be no end to its self-righteous bullying without its demise.Soat minimumye in the west, as I think you’re located, need to help the Russians and the Chinese to chase the “exceptionalist” pests out of not only western Evrope but also out of the entire landmass from the Sea of Japan to the English Channel. “We the People” and their big lie need to be driven from the Mediterranean, out of Africa (the portion between the desert and the sea), and from parts of the great continent south of the sahara. They need to be chased out of coastal islands such as Britannia, Taiwan, and Honshu. Out of Iceland and Greenland, too.Don’t believe that that’s too big a task, because there’s more. Your internationalist commies must be crushed, the rabbinate needs to be evicted or whittled down to nothing, and the blooddrinking witch doctors must be wiped out and replaced with a healthy priesthood which can teach some truth for a change. There must be no resurrection of the natsocs. And have I mentioned the globalists’ millions of imported replacements? If too many in your part of the world persist in clinging to Shemitism, sensuality, liberalism, multiculturalism, alcoholism*, and the USA’s hypocritical drivel about “unalienable Rights”, the people will be destroyed much like the USA’s “white” Trumpchumps will be ruined after the emd of PDJT 2.0, absent major attitude improvements======* The most popular and least divided religion of the people ever? The beverage alcohol industry needs to be killed, and it won’t hurt anyone but fools to abandon kickball fanaticism, too. Old Evrope must die, and a new civilization must be born.

        Being the global reserve currency no longer works for the US or for the world. However, dismantling the Eurodollar system is going to be extremely difficult and messing. But, yes, in a more sane system, the US will have to live by nature’s rules, which will be difficult for Wall Street.
The good news is that it should be better for Main Street.

        There was a great syndicated columnist in the local business paper whose name was Malcolm Berko. I guess he was a stockbroker out of the Tampa Bay area. He was way ahead of the curve when it came to pointing out the very problems we talk about on these kinds of pages about economics.One of the things that stuck with me was how he used to point out that the inflation rate was a bunch of BS. He often liked to point out the difference between the BS official inflation rate and the actual street inflation when it comes to everyday items. And this was in the 1990s, way before others, at least in the media, caught on.

            A good way to determine real inflation is to look at valuable things that are limited, like beachfront properties. However, the problem there is that they don’t benefit from increased productivity.
My best gauge for real inflation is farmland prices. Farmland is limited, but the crop yield from farmland benefits from productivity increases – which lower costs. Basically, it’s a good mix of what we see in the economy.
Since 1997, farmland has appreciated at 5.5%, which is a lot higher than the CPI of 2.5%.

                “Since 1997, farmland has appreciated at 5.5%”Interesting standard of reference. I figure that, if the rate were constant, prices would double, triple, and quadruple in 12.9 yrs, 20.5 yrs, and 25.9 yrs respectively. 2.5% would mean that these increases take 28, 44.5, and 56 yrs. It looks like your metric is a better indicator than the CPI.Acc. to a site calledAcreTrader, back in early March of 2024,Latest USDA data shows the United States losing 4.8 acres of cropland every minute.That means that the USA has lost about 2.8m acres (4, 374 mi²) of cropland since 1 Mar. 2024, again assuming a constant rate. The land area of Rhode Island is 1,034 mi², and of Connecticut, 4,849 mi².The same source (not a neutral observer, fyi) reports that cropland prices increased well above 5.5% during 2021 through 2023.According to the annual USDA survey data shown in Figure 1, cropland prices in the United States showed year-over-year increases of 7.8%, 14.3%, and 8.1% in 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The latest County Highway newspaper has an interesting article about how the data centers in northern Virginia are looking to solar to provide their massive energy needs and how this is impacting the rural parts of the state.

        “This is the end of America’s long holiday from reality.”
It’s been a nightmare for anyone who understood this early.  I was 23 in 2008, did a deep dive into economics when that “once in a lifetime” crisis hit.  Had an instinctual understanding we were bankrupt.  Glad to see this is starting to become common knowledge.  Anything goes and nothing matters will die the death it deserves with the death of easy money.  People should only have to endure one decade of easy money (the roaring 20’s) anything longer ensures mass psychosis 😉

        “We have experienced a forty-year run while at the same time the American economy transitioned from inventing things and making them to driving each other around in Ubers.”The one is connected to the other and is not a paradox. The hollowing out of the real economy and the immiseration of the American masses has been  inextricably tied to the buoyant fortune of finance capital. This is in contrast to the period from 1945 to around 1973 — referred to by the French asLes Trente Glorieuses, when everyone’s fortune was in the ascendant. Western capitalism turned cannibalistic after that, and through no choice of its own but merely because of shifting structural economic logic.“It turns out that if the mint can make as much money as it likes, being the only mint on earth anyone values, and they give what they mint to the only banking system anyone values, the people in this system can do no wrong.”This only worked as long as the Arabs could be arm-twisted into selling their oil only for dollars and recycling their surplus dollars into US treasuries. Otherwise dollar as currency reserve, after its conversion into gold at $38 an ounce ceased, would never have worked. In other words, the dollar was undergirded by “black gold.”“If you want to buy from China, it will mean doing so in their currency, not dollars.”Generally bilateral trading agreements, with nothing serving as currency reserve. Certainly not the dollar. Maybe barter agreements. But cheap imported consumer goods based on a dollar the rest of the world is increasingly reluctant to accept? Those days are numbered.“This does not mean the dollar collapses or people revert to carrying sacks of gold while riding to town on their donkey. The primitive use of shiny bits of metal as currency only comes back if we enter a dark age.”Precisely. You might have noticed the changing price of gold over the last year or so. I feel bad for the ordinary Americans who have money in their 401(k)s.

        You could have a crash like the 2008 one because nobody in the financial business had an interest in bringing the bad news to the public. It’s always roses and blue skies to keep the suckers investing in those shady investments like bundled mortgages (mortgages sold to low income people who had no chance to pay them off once the interest rates jacked up). The people who actually sold the mortgages in the first place promptly sold them on down the line and ended up rich and unpunished.

        Big problem: not enough engineers. We don’t graduate enough. Most of them are foreigners who are going home. And even if we get rid of DEI in engine schools, the public schools don’t emphasize STEM enough to produce the smart kids who can fill the seats.

            Engineering hasn’t been valued in recent decades. An engineer — if he’s fortunate enough to land a job — starts at what? $60k? A “financial engineer” can start at 120k, 150k, 200k (depending on the school he earns his grad degree from and the firm where he gets hired).

                    Engineering jobs are also closely tied to an industrial economy. Send that to China and Chinese engineers get the benefit. American engineers get screwed. My brother was an exception because he worked for a defense contractor. We haven’t sent that industry to China(yet).

                        Sadly, this is one of the major drivers of American military adventurism and aggression. If America actually tried to stop antagonizing the world its one remaining industrial sector would collapse. Everyone knows that the “defense” industry is protected (rightly) from most outsourcing and foreign competition. Investors know this and know that buying a share of a company that makes war widgets is a safer bet than buying a share of one that just makes widgets because the federal government subsidizes the former. The remaining native born engineers in the US also know that being able to get a clearance keeps them from getting Pajeet-ed like all those Python coding schmucks losing their jobs to Rajeesh the H1B.This is one of the many reasons I will be pleasantly surprised if Trump is able to both re-industrializeandcut us loose from Isra-hell and the Eurotrash countries, and manages to stop the neocons from starting a suicidal war with Russia or picking a fight with Iran (which probably ends by pulling Russia in).The most obvious (and easy – and stupid – and lazy) way to re-industrialize is just to go pedal to the floor with warmongering and massively expand the defense sector. That’s where a lot of the remaining skilled tradesmen, machinists, industrial engineers, etc… already are. Just pump in infinity dollars so we can start bombing EVERYONE.

                “A “financial engineer” can start at 120k, 150k, 200k (depending on the school he earns his grad degree from and the firm where he gets hired).”This is an old (30-40 year) problem.  Trump is in the process of killing off (rebalancing the market wrt) the symbol manipulators.  The balance could be reversed if he’s successful.The other problem is that STEM is hard!  Engineering requires discipline and a background in tough subjects like Math.  Our (public) secondary schools no longer establish such in their graduates.  Business degree not so much.However, most of these business majors do *not* wind up in $100K+ positions, just like lawyers (another glut) do not wind up in such positions at prestigious law firms.   Nor do engineers start/stay at $60k.  A good engineer is hard to find, they will move up salary-wise quickly.Anybody from a handful of prestigious (Ivy league?) schools may land a high paying position, but they represent a fraction of the pool of graduates.  For example, what MIT or Cal Tech graduate goes unemployed, but how many a year are graduated?

                    I was not in the top ten graduates from my ridiculously accomplished h.s. class. I did score just below perfect on the SAT, #2 in my class and a NMSF. Mr. Perfect, 800 math, solo son of our town’s communist opthamologist, was sent to math camp whereas I got forced to wrestling camp.Dude graduated MIT, where my fam has staked a presence. I attended state school. He acquired his CDL and drove a semi for two years, wbich is fairly rich for a french horn player. Converted his CDL logbook into a novel/novelty that oddly made itself into the hands of Steve Jobs via MIT network. Flown out, won interview, and was Jobs’ right hand exec for SE pretty much today.Point is, engineering has become a ticket to stagnation for all but Mr. Mathcamp. You moved up or out through the funnel. The business guys, Boomtards, didn’t give two chitz about R&amp;D except for the money raised and handed over to them. Genuine product repackaging is alive and well; actual R&amp;D is greatly reduced.We cannot catch up to the rest of the entire world except for this striking or that striking. Risk.Glad I eventually went patent law. Protectionism with government imprimatur par excellence. Lookin’ to clean up.

                Unfortunately true, that first part. Most of what’s called engineering is calculator grunt work. But the electronic jeet is even dumber than the real one. It’ll find a way to crash the oil tankers back into the desert they came from.We remember conservatives saying we’d have to snap out of it before we degenerated to the point of makingaffirmative action planesandfeminist bridgesand shit. “They have tonot fall downha ha!” Well, we have affirmative-action planes and feminist bridges now, andthey fall down, and nobody cares.Not caring is the progress we’ve made. “AI” doesn’t work for almost any of the purposes it’s being put to. Itcannot,because it’s a congenital liar, just like its meat counterparts. But that doesn’t matter at all. It’sfinance applied to real things. The house wins, so it “works.”

                    Copper abounds in the US.  Unfortunately so do regulations and lawfare.  Right down the road from my burg lies a huge deposit of copper and it is now going on 30+ years that a proposed mine has been delayed in opening by the tree huggers—even though the Fed’s had signed off on it, the tree huggers are now repeatedly in the courts and of course the Biden administration rolled back some of the approvals.

                “AI will solvemuch of this. It is already happening.”Maybe so, for a while, then the Russians and Chinese figure out what’s going on. This gets them thinking about the logical conclusions in terms of American weapons development and testing, and logicstics management.Given the empire’s libido dominandi and her thirst for their blood and resources, the Russians and Chinese quickly conclude that their very survival depends upon cancelling the scores of data centers, power plants, substations, and other infrastructure being built for AI. Theyhaveto act.Crippling or knocking out that infrastructure would be like killing much of the generation of engineers needed before and during the war(s) for which DJT was hired to prepare the empire of Usury, Sensuality, and Avarice.The longer that the Asian powers delay action, the more probable is their destruction.

            “The public schools don’t emphasize STEM enough to produce the smart kids who can fill the seats.”I get what you’re saying about DEI, but there have been plenty of smart kids with good credentials who don’t get into top universities. They’re teaching remedial math at Harvard for God’s sake. Why? Because “marginalized” black and brown students can’t do the work. Meanwhile, white males, in particular, have been short-changed by the entire education system. It wouldn’t take long to turn that around.

            Thirty+ years ago most “engineering work” was tech work that was performed by high school grad White boys trained on the job. Griggs v. Duke power ended that pipeline. In an average month my entire firm does about 10 hours of real engineering work. The rest of it? Paperwork, boilerplate engineering, and meetings. Paperwork, boilerplate engineering, and meetings.

Spot on.
The US can forget about reindustrializing and competing with China if it isn’t going to develop the largest and highest-quality engineering workforce possible.
The quality of Western engineering education is also in doubt. One of the best examples of this is how the Russians dropped the Western model of engineering education and returned to the old Soviet methods after noticing a precipitation decline in the quality of their engineering grads.

                Exactly, but you can’t do much without acknowledging your raw ingredients—White’s and Asian’s.  To mention the countries of China and Russia as examples (even though true) ignores the elephant in the room.
Russia and China are not burdened by lack of raw material, the USA is.  That coupled with AA and DIE handicaps, produces quite an impediment to engineer production—and yes it starts as far back as primary school in the USA.
There are alternatives as you hinted at with education in the art, but that’s a long discussion best for another topic.

            I think someone above pointed out the economics of financialization in getting our cognitively gifted to apply physics to market pirating activity instead of toward STEM. They were further pressured by the inflation and cost of living in our homeland. Meanwhile, the only path forward for upward mobility for India and China was actually doing STEM or cognitive professions.The entire system created perverse incentives. Perhaps many of the White traitors will become advocates once quant funds no longer provide employment. Z contends that AI will replace engineers.If that is the case then Juan, Carter, Shankar, Xilao, Djiwowo, Vlad and Ahmed are going to go toe to toe looking for manufacturing jobs. Shades of the late 19th century except not all Northern Europeans.The Regime has created a horrific mess. Carter and Vlad better stick together and there better be Mass Deportations.https://odysee.com/@WyattStagg:e/Leonard-Cohen-Exposed:4

This is also correct.
There are a lot of bright engineering minds that realized they could make far more working in private equity or investment banking rather than slaving away in a cube for 30 or 40 years.
If I got a do over in life I would definitely consider that path.

                Beginning at 9:10 that so-called Canadian talks about themes of the murky mysticism called kabbalistic “thought”. Centuries ago that mumbojumbo led Israel into disaster such as belief in Shabbetai Tzvi (1626-1676). He was one of several wannabe mashiachs throughout history who arose and passed away without completing mashiach’s mission. We can be sure that a slew of new aspirants will appear during the next 215 years as they approach the year 6000, but all of them will fail.Listen closely to phrases such as “repair of God”, “pieces of him or her or it”, “repair the face of God”, and “remind God”. Malevolent Cohen is hinting strongly at Israel’s great problem, namely, that its own cloud people (elohim in Gen. 1) were badly divided long, long ago. If Cohen had understood better what he was talking about, and had been willing to speak openly about it, he’d have said ‘pieces ofthem‘ and ‘theywere once a harmonious unity’.In fact, the competing, inconsistent creation stories of Gen. 1-2 are evidence that the founders, presumably Canaanite/Phonecian, failed to establish a coherent system through which to perpetuate the nation they founded. There was no original “harmonious unity”. The nation of Israel was disorderly, and its elohim were in darkness, like the founders of the USA.A large part of Israel’s problem is that most of Israel’s own children, including the remnant Levites it seems, are indoctrinated into a crude monotheisism which is not much different from the Muhammadists’ superstition. Once a being becomes an adult, it’s very difficuly to make the leap of knowledge and understanding from that crudeness to the concept of elohim as a group of mere mortals, as one must in order to begin understanding the creation allegory. Yet without that leap, the leaders of Israel’s remnants cannot comprehend their own unholy scriptures, nor implement the founders’ mitzvot without destroying Israel, nor establish the “harmonious unity” needed to accomplish goals like the one set forth in Isaiah 66:22-24.Of course, there’s no way to reconcile the two concepts of elohim. One is a blatant founders’ lie in which Israel is trapped, and the other is a self-serving allegory told by those first clouds. A sort of schizophrenia results from trying to hang on to both, and having neither can make any one of the Israelites become the so-called self-hating Jew who despises the nation of Israel and even turns on it. This foundational disorder is therefore intrinsic to Trinitarianism, too. It can’t be circumvented by, say, forcing the classical, unisraelite idea of a trinity of gods onto Genesis 1. That’s like modifying the face on Lady Liberty to look like the USA’s millions of pieces of obsolete farm equipment. There’s no way to have a stable Christian nationalism, and it’s not just because the Christ’s nation is supposed to be Israel alone, not a larger portion of humanity.Ultimately, Israel’s elders and teachers have no transcendant goals to teach to their young. Their religion is a thickly disguised political secularism flecked with humanist notions about justice. As such, it’s a perennial inspiration for their busybodyism which has spread over most of the Earth, from which Israel must eventually retreat into tiny strongholds before disappearing entirely after 6000 AM.By using an understanding of Israel’s defective past as both positive guidance and unintended negative guidance, we ourselves can begin anew. We can assemble tribes and synchronize them into a powerful nation of tribes, but of course without the folly of calling ourselves Israel, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and so on. This we can do without claiming to be a new Israel and while avoiding also Israel’s crude, brutal customs (e.g. animal sacrifice) and divisive errrors such as the cardiac theory of human being (symbolized at 1:30 of the video) and the doctrine of an omniscient being who can think.

            As others have pointed out, the need for competent engineers is dropping, and not because we are de-industrializing, but because of computers. Back in the late ’90s I worked out all the calculations for a new production line I was considering, and contacted a vendor for a quote on a plate heat exchanger. I was transferred to a glorified data entry clerk who put in the values of the system I was designing, and it spit back out pretty much the same specs I figured. In under a minute. Five minutes later, this person, who could have been a high school dropout for all I know, had specced out the entire system, complete with pricing.Engineering will remain, at least on a bespoke basis, until probably Millennials start dying out. But the bulk of engineering will be done by computers and typists.Which should be a positive thing. Imagine that you have an idea for a product, and some rough idea of how to make it, and teh intarwebz designs it and finds all the equipment for you to set up shop in your own garage. No more “wage slavery”. Take your lunch break with your kids, that your wife is homeschooling.

        “The primitive use of shiny bits of metal as currency only comes back if we enter a dark age.”I beg to differ a bit.  Of course you are correct within the context of how financial transactions occur today, but what about the future?  Countries around the world are pushing to eliminate “paper” currency and establish “digital” currency.  Digital currency will be under complete control of the central authority, and of course any form of privacy in personal transactions a thing of the past.  The ability to manipulate Fed account ledgers seems infinite as well.Take China and Canada as recent examples of the problems with such.  China took/froze protesting citizens ability to use “their(?)” bank deposits for transactions during the scamdemic (IIR) when banks had runs on them.  Similarly, Canada froze assets in bank accounts on all truckers who were protesting awhile back, thereby breaking the blockade they had imposed.  India also deserves special recognition as they’ve removed high denomination currency from circulation, thereby forcing more and more citizens to deal with each other digitally or carry a wheelbarrow around with cash.  Onerous Fed regulations have moved any number of banking institutions to drop customers in high cash operations, like bullion exchanges, swap meets, and even firearms dealers.Is this what you want, because it’s what will happen in a system that no longer uses tangible currency.  Even alternative digital currency, like Bitcoin requires access via the Internet which increasingly is controlled by the powers that be.  I for one attempt to keep a bit of that “primitive” exchange currency at the ready.  I don’t see such ever going out of fashion.  On the contrary, I see the need for such increasing.There’s an old saying, “bad money drives out good”.  I’d update that to say, “digital currency drives the need for physical alternatives”!

            Our so-called rights have been exposed as a real crock of excrement. Listen to the Tucker Carlson interview with Alex Jones just put up this week. I’m not even an Alex Jones fan and I find what happened to him absolutely infuriating. Also infuriating that nobody is being punished and having to pay a price for these abuses.
If “they” want people to continue to believe in our system, they better start backing up with a teach us in high school democracy class with punishment for the people who get out of line and abuse people’s rights.

        When it comes to investment strategy, you see a lot of “back testing.” As in, this strategy was back tested to 1945, or 1965, or 1985, or something. And here’s how it did. Oblivious to the probability that the next 80 years could be radically different from the last 80. Oblivious to the probability that the postwar boom and subsequent financialization were the anomalies, not the norm. This period gave rise to dogma such as “stay invested, never sell, the market always goes up over time.” Because that has been good advice for 80 years. But nobody was saying anything like that in the 1940s. You’d have been ridiculed for saying it, even though you would have been right (at that time). Who is being ridiculed the most today? Likewise, probably the people who are right.One of the (many) large consequences of this era will turn out to be tying people’s retirement to the stock market. That definitely would have been unthinkable in the 40s. Someday there will again come a time when it is unthinkable.While I’m hesitant to declare the end of the world over a 10-15% market decline, the loss of confidence resulting from the tariff flip flopping could turn out to be critical. That would be my expectation. That confidence is already gone and there’s no way to regain it anytime soon. I think what happened is the bond market flashed red, this was brought to Trump’s attention, and he lost his nerve. Kind of reminds me of his first term, which started out with some positive things before he cucked. I’ll allow for the possibility that it’s all 5d chess. I’m trying to trust the plan.

        I don’t pretend to know whether Trump’s tariff reversal was due to bond market instability or 4D chess. What I do know is that we now have baseline 10% duties across the board, 125% on the most predatory exporter, and the world seems grateful. Neat trick, even if he stumbled into it.Regardless, the bond market is still king of the hill, as it has been since the early 90s, at least. It will remain so as long as deficit spending persists, which means until doomsday (literally).Also, whether or not a trade deal is ultimately reached with China, our relationship with them is now overtly adversarial. That could get spicy.

If you don’t like their goods, don’t buy them. Quite simple. As I see it, they manufacture high quality goods at reasonable prices. The USA doesn’t. Don’t blame the Chinese for USA’s manifold shortcomings.

                Back in the early 90s, I told my wife to avoid buying stuff from China. She eventually begged me to relent because it was difficult to find stuff (esp. stuff for kids) that wasn’t made in China. She also  pointed out that the stuff that wasn’t made in China was usually made in some Third World country (i.e., some sweatshop), not the USA.

                I don’t blame them at all.  They are doing what a healthy organism or society does:  look out for their own good.  Our collective good requires reindustrialization and tariffs are part of what’s needed.  We understood when developing countries used import replacement strategies before, its our turn now.

                I’m hardly one to apologize for AINO’s shortcomings, but there is ample proof of the shoddiness of Chinese manfacturing. In many cases, even if one wants to avoid Chinesium, there are no alternatives.

                This is a correct statement by Arshad.  I’d only add that in the case of China—goods excellent or not—there may be a strategic aspect to trade with such a country of such magnitude.

        I wouldn’t rule out investing in the stock market, especially if one’s time frame is long enough.  There is a recent scholarly study that rejects ordinary asset allocation models in favor of an all-equity portfolio, with an optimum allocation of one-third domestic and two-thirds international equities.  The paper is entitled:Beyond the Status Quo: A Critical Assessment of Lifecycle Investment Advice ,by Aizhan Anarkulova, Scott Cederburg and Michael S. O’Doherty.  Their analysis is equity and bond markets in over 30 countries, going back to the 1890s for some countries.  You should be able to find it on the internet and the most recent update was just last month.  They admit that there is a huge psychological cost associated with this investment strategy, which anyone watching markets over the last week or so can readily understand.  Still, before you head for T-bills and CDs, you should consider the arguments that they make.  One, by the way is a chemical engineer from Iowa State University who decided to go into finance.

I remember groups like McGraw gap, the bluegrassholes, and Larry keel experience were doing this before strings was even born.it feels too like an artificial extension of the Grateful Dead which was an artificial extension of the 60s.but in the 90s at least you had some songwriting innovation. . Say what you will about Dave Mathew’s he was an actually talented songwriter not just a flashy performer like stringsfast picking gets boring to me but I’ll keep an open mind.what was the topic?

        Without a trade deficit, there will be nobody to buy the bonds.  All that money that goes out of the country comes back in the form of buying gov bonds, US stocks and real estate and drives up their prices.I heard yesterday that 25 trillion Dollars in bonds will mature in the next 5 years.  It will all have to be rolled over at the new higher rates.  Though undoubtedly at least some of that will be 30 year treasuries from 1995-2000, so the interest will probably come down on those. But we are very heavy in short term bonds, which means it will have to be rolled over at the new higher interest rates.

            The trade deficit is tied to the Eurodollar system. The world needs dollars. The global financial and trade system can’t function without them. The only way to get those dollars is the US running a trade deficit, particularly in manufacturing.
But this destroys our manufacturing sector and put the US in deeper and deeper debt, which is why the system will blow up at some point. Trump and Bessent are trying to change the system now instead of waiting for it to crash.

                I don’t disagree.  I’m just pointing out that when you start mucking with a complex system, it has all kinds of secondary and tertiary effects, some anticipated, some not.I think Trump should not be doing this all at once with every country in the world. Our manufacturers cannot pick up overnight. It will take years to start a manufacturing economy.  It took 50 years to get to this point and it cannot be undone in a year or 2.  Just physically building a factory will take a year or more and that’s assuming everything goes well.  Designing and building a production line will take even longer with the custom configured machinery.  Training people to work in manufacturing will take many years.  A tool and die maker takes a decade and longer to train, at least with OTJ training.Not only is doing this overnight a problem, it would be a problem even if the financial markets were healthy and we had savings to finance all these factories being built.  But depression like conditions will exist should the existing order collapse.  We’re not even talking about the regulatory BS.

                    One of the costs of the outsourcing of industry was the loss of the skilled workforce associated with manufacturing. It will indeed take time to re-establish that workforce. The gov should re-orient its subsidies away from universities into trade schools that teach those skills. The Germans have always recognized this and have an established two-tier educational system: 𝘎𝘺𝘯𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘶𝘮 for the smarter kids going to a university and 𝘙𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘴𝘤𝘩𝘶𝘭𝘦 for those who will be tradesmen.

            “Without a trade deficit, there will be nobody to buy the bonds.”
The people running up dollar surpluses don’t want to buy bonds anyway — they lose purchasing power. They exchange their dollars — what Michael Hudson calls “hot potato” dollars — for something else as fast as possible. US paper of any kind is a sucker bet. You have to lose.

                Only this isn’t exactly true.  There are many trillions of Dollar denominated contracts across the world.  A lot of the world does business in Dollars.

        My concern about that last paragraph is that this is an enormous number of people.  And they were raised and educated in a system that trained them for the financialized economy you describe.  And they took jobs in the only economy available to them.  In short, they went where the money was, just like any rational being would.And those who resisted?  Well, their factories were simply sent to Taiwan and the slave labor camps of China.Suddenly, 2-3 GENERATIONS of Americans who maybe dreamed of building ships, planes, and spacecraft were providing financial serves and making coffee or sitting in office buildings shuffling papers around.The transition shock is going to a lot worse than people realize.  Particularly for people over 50.There is NO PLAN for how to do this.

        A manufacturing renaissance would require a massive influx of new talent – – millions of people trained, motivated, and managed to do these newly-onshored jobs. And, most of these will be males. While jobs vulnerable to automation skew male – – the rise of generative AI disproportionately affects female-dominated roles. The days of the “Gen Z Boss and a Mini” might be numbered…

            I toyed with the idea of buying gold, but it is logistically impossible the way I see it, at least in large amounts.First of all, I don’t trust paper gold. The underlying gold is too easy to confiscate. Likewise, when it comes to gold being stored elsewhere. Like I trust them to not have sold my chunk of that gold three times over? Likewise, you can’t keep it in a safe deposit box, which banks are phasing out anyway.What about a safe at home? If everything goes tits up and we end up living in a Mad Max kind of world, which is the main reason you buy gold, I can’t imagine being able to keep all the looters out of my stash.So paper money it is and hope for the best. At least we have the Jews here. Whatever their faults, they are good with money. That should protect us to a certain extent since obviously a crash of our economic system would harm them way more.

                    Gold is a hedge/store of wealth—not an investment.  If push comes to shove and economic disruption is severe, you’ll not fill up your gas tank with paper currency, but you may with a gold or silver coin.As far as who takes what in exchange for goods, there will always be middlemen who will take your gold, silver and whatnot and give you whatever medium of exchange is desired.  Look to unstable countries like Argentina and Zimbabwe for current examples.  Their paper currency was exchanged on the “Black market” for years in order for folk to hedge against their country’s hyperinflation.So it will be here too, if the SHTF.

There are gold alternatives to full up bars.
On eBay, it is not too hard to find gold rounds in 1/4 and 1/10 oz weights.
There are also Goldbacks with embedded foil strips of gold. The precise weight escapes me at the moment. Supposedly these instruments are accepted as legal tender in several states.

                If you can’t store your own physical gold, you can’t store your own paper currency.  If you have either in the hands of another—in this case a bank or private repository—you don’t “own” it and you are subject to the precise problem you bought it for in the first place—confiscation or embezzlement.

                Back when gold was under 2k Dollars an ounce, a million dollars in gold would easily fit in a shoe box.  Obviously there are some risks to storing gold yourself, but I don’t think it is that hard.  Right now, 100k Dollars is just over 30oz.  You could stick that under the carpets assuming you know how to kick the carpet back down. Put your entertainment center or sofa over that spot.

                We have a very large home safe defended by firearms (yes, it’s true, they sometimes “just go off,” beware).But I’m reminded of our neighborhood friend, Jerry Ranalli. I once went in to Ranalli’s for the usual garbage salad, and to flirt with Baba, the Italian/Polish hybrid with desireable acoutrements, and was suprised to see a yuge hole in the wooden floor boards. Police tape surrounded the hole.Visible below in the basement was a bank safe and acetylene tank with torch.  “Burglers” (widely apprehended as Jerry seeking insurance money for the “cash” supposedly stored in the safe) were said to have given up and fled when an upstairs tenant smelled the safe cooking in acetylene.We suffer no delusions regarding the End Of Times/SHTF experience here in Chiraq. Still, a professional quality safe and semi-auto rifles will make the bastards work for it. And they hate to work (so do I).Perhaps there is value in the home asset safe. Most gun safes are an impolite joke.

                        Somebody forgot to tell Jerry. I was not joking about the event. Needless to say, they were not serving my salad. It’s not just a story, it happened.

                        I was figuring the guy was smelling the coating on the safe being burned away. That stuff can smell truly nasty.

                    I met an old bird who had 16 pounds of gold at the time.  He made regular stops at the currency exchange shops lining cities this side of the Canadian border.  A $200 purchase or less meant no I.D. was required, and he had been doing it for years.
Can’t trade gold bars at Costco?  Maybe not, but you can go to the coin galleries and buy all the coined metal currency you can handle in useful denominations.
(Hint: during Weimar one guy paid off his apartment house with one thin silver dime.)

                    If things really go so bad that you need to protect that safe, it should hold your throw guns and petty cash. A few ounces of gold, maybe 10 pounds of silver, a small stack of benjamins so they can believe that’s your savings. A couple boxes of ammo, tops. Make sure it’s in a prominent enough place so the bad guys see it when (not if) they gain access to the place. That way, you can put up a little resistance to giving up the combination, then cave when (again, not if) they get ready to take bolt-cutters to your kids’ fingers and toes, and blowtorches to their genitals and faces.Don’t open up your real caches (note the plural) but a little at a time.

                Buy half ounce gold coins, paint them with black nail polish, cover them with matching fabric and sew them onto a cardigan sweater. When pressed for funds, pull off the bottom button and use nail polish remover. Travel light, Travel smart…
