        There is nothing contradictory in the current strategy being pursued by the Biden cabal.  On one hand, they push domestic programs and policies that are guarantied to diminish at least, or at best destroy traditional America, while also pursuing a foreign policy that guaranties the ascendancy of their globalist masters.  So, they knock down the American (or, if you will, ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù) hegemony and in its place, they ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù with a unified global suzerainty, with them at the top and the rest of us under their bootheel.  See, that wasn‚Äôt so hard to understand, was it?

Paging Ben the Layabout, resident Nietzsche lover. Here is a post on Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, and the possible compatability between their seemingly different Weltanshauungen. Interesting.

        It‚Äôs easy for us to imagine the destruction of the system around the corner with the next recession or next failed war effort but globohomo continues to grow ever more grotesque. They are plundering what little wealth resides in Europe but the system can keep going for a long time, generally until creature comforts like sportsball watching becomes impossible. It could fall apart but we should also brace for a situation by 2060 where America is 35% white, $150 trillion in debt, and debating whether it should be made illegal for white people to procreate with other white people.

I read awhile back that *after* the fall of Rome, somewhere up to 535 AD, the Roman Circus and Colosseum were still in use.  Basically operational until the population fell into the few 10‚Äôs of thousands and there was no one left to watch.  üòâ

        Everything since 2008 and especially since 2020 (money laundering on steriods) has been money laundering and keeping the status quo afloat.  The war started in 2020, the US needed to print but wasn‚Äôt able to approach its population and say ya know guys, we never fixed the problems from 2008 that we told you we fixed.  That dog wouldn‚Äôt hunt, not in 2020, and especially since everything since 2008 has been an effort to keep the young people who protested the bailouts at each others throats.  So we had covid which had a larger bailout then 2008 by a few trillion.  I think our .gov approached the Russians and the Chinese and said, hey guys we need to print a shit ton of money again, can we count on you to not rock the boat?  And they told them to F%$* off like they should.  Then we blew up that Iranian generally to scare them, when that didn‚Äôt work we went full on covid and used that as the excuse to print money.  Anybody here see how much Pfizer is raising the price on one of their jabs?  Yeah they just want to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù ;).  We‚Äôre already at war they just haven‚Äôt told you yet.

            actually i‚Äôd say every ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù we‚Äôve had since 9/11 has been an elite inside job.  Think of all the money that was skimmed in the middle east and where we just fled with our tails between our legs.  How many trillions did we spend in those places the past 20 years?

        In a move that surprised no one a jury takes three hours to convict Darrell Brooks of all 76 counts.
Did anyone watch the trial? I watched a good chunk of it. It was literally and figuratively a black comedy.

            The fact they allowed that murderous, loud mouthed, moronic spook to laughably represent itself while continually disrupting the trial proceedings shows just how pathetic the legal/court system has become.  It should have been bound and gagged throughout the entire trial.

                The ‚Äújudge‚Äù who presided over this case proved that she was better off being in a Brazzers video. The failures of white women in these key roles are mounting up quickly and in increasingly embarrassing situations for the country.

                    I agree with the posts here. Oh for the times of summary execution. One thing, however, is I can understand why the judge let him go on. If she gagged him (metaphorically), his immediate appeal (which will come regardless) would be likely granted and a new trial started all over on the grounds that the judge‚Äôs preferential treatment of the proscutors biased the jury against him. Again, the indictment is against our legal system, but I believe the judge acted wisely.

                @usNthemThank you for using the correct pronouns to describe ‚Äúit‚Äù.  That is exactly what they are.  They are not humans, they are ‚Äúthings‚Äù and should always be addressed as such.The mockery of our judicial system continues.  Just imagine if he had been white and behaved that way in the court room.  You may have seen him tazed and beaten right on TV.  Especially since every MSM channel would have been broadcasting it 24/7.Notice that the judge girl boss got ‚Äútough‚Äù when a member of a victim‚Äôs family called him a worthless piece of shit and she removed him from the courtroom.  I am absolutely beyond my limit for this nonsense.  I will never understand how God allowed the black race to exist.

                And why not make a mockery of the proceedings?  He gets only ‚Äúlife‚Äù in prison with the ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù.  He‚Äôll actually be better off than on the outside.  Justice has become a joke‚Äîunless you are white dirt people, then they come down hard.

        What will be interesting to me is how the Bidens, pre-2020 were involved in Ukraine and how that led to our current situation.  There is no way the two are not connected.
Was this to extract $ before Russia took over?Was it to push the Ukrainian gov‚Äôt further toward NATO (and $)?

            Both the US and UK are strongly, illogically attached to [something about] Ukraine. It‚Äôs been a hive of financial corruption (Americans‚Äô) and ‚Äúhuman trafficking‚Äù (every non-black country‚Äôs) for generations, sure. But that‚Äôs all gone on smoothly, without necessitating war, since Khrushchev was swinging his shoe around.Midget comedy president‚Äôs declaration that Ukr is ‚Äúnew Israel‚Äù is the weirdest thing any non-Biden politician has ever said. *Whose*? For what?An American president has been impeached (and couped) for *wondering about it*.There‚Äôs a religious/mythical/psychotic/??? DESTINY that our rulers cannot be dissuaded from. We know that it requires that almost everyone on earth, starting with ‚ÄúWestern civilization,‚Äù must die. Then they‚Äôre gonna‚Ä¶live in Kiev?WTF?

            I would suggest that the Biden corruption was just another vibrant fruit on the tree, surrounded by many others. Undoubtedly one of the most succulent (as his position as VP), but I think the Biden involvement is simply a symptom of the prevailing arrangement, rather than a precipitator.

        FWIW, the rumblings within the MIC and Defense world from a civilian contractor perspective doesn‚Äôt indicate the US going on a war footing anytime soon. The Ukraine boondoggle appears to be a payday for MIC to manufacture more bombs, missiles, and equipment to boost the shareholders bottom line.The scary part is that this isn‚Äôt some military operation in a backwater 3rd world country. This conflict has geo-political consequences for the entire globe, yet this administration is treating it as if we aren‚Äôt poking a nuclear-armed bear.The release of the letter Monday indicates that some within the regime have an understanding of how damaging this could be as the situation drags on. Too much opportunity for accidental escalation are present.

                There is a lot of money sloshing around for just about everything for Ukraine. This is a naked cash grab by so many industries‚Ä¶if people found out the extent of profits and corruption, the war would be even more unpopular.
I‚Äôm not going to share the industry I‚Äôm in for obvious reasons but there is a lot of money to be made for diverting numerous resources to Ukraine. We are screwing over our current customers because we make almost five times more profit selling for Ukraine aid than our current customers.

                Perhaps the 60s peaceniks were not what you think.It seems they were more a way to cement a left cultural base institutionally into a generation, rather than an anti-war movement. If you think about it, the overall politics never went away, unlike previous anti-war orgs which drifted off after the war.The war just gave them the anchor to run the conditioning.Much in the same way the anti-nuclear movement did in the 80s, which gave the embedded anti-hydrocarbon base we have now. But logically it makes no sense for the 2 to be related.They are just group formation mechanisms, which can then be out to other uses later on by switching the message focus.

        We‚Äôve already seen the Globohomo response to ‚Äúthreats‚Äù based on the Freedom Convoy.They are incapable of acknowledging that there are other views of how things should be ‚Äì just disagreeing throws them into fits of rage and hatred. They call everyone Nazis while also calling it a fringe and meaningless movement (in Russia‚Äôs case, Putin is the Nazi and their military is small, weak, and about to run out of fuel any day now). They pretend not to understand why people are doing something (what‚Äôs wrong with people these days?‚Äù). They keep escalating instead of partaking in some simple negotiations and end up having to go full scorched-earth.In the case of the Freedom Convoy, some of the relatively saner elements of Provincial/Local governments and businesses took notice and dropped restrictions. Eventually the Globohomo feds‚Äô position just looked stupid and untenable, so they dropped all their mandates too. In the case of Ukraine, some of the relatively saner nations such as China and India are hedging their bets and quietly moving the other way, even in the face of scorched earth tactics.But from what we‚Äôve seen, they have no gear other than ‚Äúescalate‚Äù, and they will do so up to the point of nukes, rather than be confronted with somebody who disagrees with their whims. They are extremely dangerous, arrogant, and stupid.

            In Buffalo this week, six feral teens stole a car and crashed at high speed.  For four of them it will mark their final felony.  I just got finished reading an article inThe Buffalo Newsabout it and the comments section is a real hoot.  Not a single comment exists with even a whiff of race realism ‚Äî at best there were concerns expressed about poor home lives and poor decision making ‚Äî but the shitlibs who normally read the paper are enraged at the alleged torrent of racist comments.  They swarm anyone who doesn‚Äôt express sympathy for the poor yutes and demand the the comment section be closed because of all the budding Klansmen having their say.  One of the dead is a 14 year old girl with a 6 month old baby.  Even expresing some reservations about that lifestyle choice makes one literally Hitler.These people cannot be engaged with.  Their types felt a thrill up their legs when Trudeau cracked down, and were only sorry that he didn‚Äôt go full Tiananmen.  Casting a vote in the same election as them should be considered a stain on one‚Äôs soul.

            When almost an entire continent is willing to flush their economy down the toilet just to be in your good graces, and another former prison island continent allows themselves to be bullied into whatever cultural fads the GAE is advocating for, it makes one a touch arrogant.
Problem is, both sides of the new centers of power are in decline.  It‚Äôs basically a race to the bottom now.  Long term though, I would bet on the civilization that didn‚Äôt flush its genetics down the toilet.

                Its not an entire continent. Its about less than 1000 politicians placed in all the countries and EU institutions.
It shows that if your business model is training and placing politicians and functionaries in a transnational programme, you can control hundreds of millions of people by using a small number in key positions.
What do people think all the young leader/global leadership programmes are about?
Their business is staff for the sham democracies.

            4d chess narratives are suspect even when the supposed chess players are sane and intelligent people‚Ä¶ but when the 4d chess players are pampered prep school jews, crossdressers, 85 IQ cannibals pretending to be government officials, hysterical frightened barren women, etc it becomes wildly improbableThey have (implicit or explicit satanic) religious beliefs, class dispositions, jaundiced sheltered perspectives, vulgar desires for gain, perverse sexual compulsions, vicious grudges and resentments against healthy people.  Ruling class behavior is humanly reducible just to this.  Its a spiritual sickness thats metastasized and enervates every part of our society.They dont have some long term geopolitical masterplan that is being intelligently executed.  Its sick fools being lead to and fro by sick schemers and nothing more.

            That ship has sailed, this country wll never be united again. I should say this geographic area, we aren‚Äôt really a country anymore. No matter what happens you‚Äôll not see any uniting in a common purpose because too many of us on both sides have no desire to work together and will at least root for the foreign opponent.

                You‚Äôre so unfortunately correct, Compsci. I used to believe that human beings are sheep; the effectiveness of the Corona-doom panic campaign taught me that human beings are, in fact, Pavlovian dogs. When the global technocracy and its vast array of media organs ring the dinner bell on whatever their new fad/hysteria happens to be, a disturbingly high percentage of common folks start salivating. It‚Äôs a disenchanting spectacle to say the least.

        If not for Russia‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, they would be demanding ‚Äúunconditional surrender‚Äù as the only off road of the war, just as they did to Japan and Germany.  These psychos have made peace impossible by saying total victory by Ukraine is the only possible way to end the war.  Russia‚Äôs security and other interests are just off the table and irrelevant.They are so convinced of their own righteousness and goodness that they cannot conceive that someone else might not see their plans for Ukraine in benign terms.  Hopefully enough of them will die of old age before China decides the time is right for Taiwan unification.

        Righteous indignation feels good. When the Regime and it‚Äôs compliant media arouse indignation against ‚ÄòPutin the new Hitler‚Äô and the Russian bear, it distracts the American people from noticing (and being outraged by)  the inflation, rising Black crime, ‚Äòtransgender‚Äô insanity, open southern border, and campaign against ‚ÄòWhiteness‚Äô which is transforming the America we once knew.

        AOC is a useful bellwether, as she has an overly inflated view of her influence and power. She‚Äôs usually the first person to step on a rake and get a slapped down by the actual powers in D.C. If I recall correctly, something similar happened when she spoke against Pelosi as House Speaker.Sanders is smart enough to realize he‚Äôs just supposed to be an outlet for the anti-war marxists, and usually knows when to change his tune before things get too hot.  No one can convince me he actually wanted to win the presidential nomination against Hillary, but his job was to make it seem real.I‚Äôm sure the fame is fun, but what a humiliating existence otherwise.

Sanders‚Äô role is that of a Judas goat, who leads the other sheep to slaughter ‚Äî or in this case to the barren wasteland of Democrat politics, where all progressive causes go to die. His job is to make the claim of Dems being a little on the left halfway credible. To my mind Sanders is as contemptible a human being as the utterly worthless Biden. There is no politics in the USA ‚Äî it‚Äôs all distraction, deflection, entertainment, media hype, disinformation.

        ‚ÄúRather than the paranoia of one or two fossils it is a culture of paranoia among a gerontocracy. The Ukraine war just happens to be the issue through which they are exercising their intolerance of dissent, but &gt;&gt;it could be any issue.&lt;&lt;&quot;That strikes me as possibly the best explanation. Once you&#x27;ve got sufficient power, there&#x27;s little need to manipulate public opinion. Remember the Iraq War? Why the nonsense about WMD&#x27;s? &quot;We wanna get rid of Saddam and we&#x27;re going to.&quot; No further explanation required.Hillary and others are already proclaiming that a &quot;Red Wave&quot; now and in two years will mean &quot;the bad guys stole the election.&quot; Makes me think that the regime is worried that their ability to rig elections may be less in the bag than they&#x27;ve thought. I don&#x27;t know why they should worry. Who&#x27;s the opposition they&#x27;re afraid of?

‚ÄúIf you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalised; if all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance ‚Äì you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.‚Äù
Understatement at it‚Äôs best.

                    Exactly.  That‚Äôs why I reject arguing whether or not 2020 election was ‚Äústolen‚Äù‚Äîtoo many rabbit holes.  I simply jump to the potential flaws in the process.  No reason for them, except to produce fraud.  Elections are way too important to have even a hint of fraud so one needs no proof, only the *possibility*.  That possibility taints the process and therefore must be fixed.One might argue that elections have always been subject to fraud.  I agree, however, the population has never been this divided wrt to *goals*, only how to achieve what was in essence a common agreement among the people.  That of course is due to the current lack of common race and the destruction of such over the decades.

The long shot is the Ukraine as a new/old home base. Lots of money and arms going to a plucky, carved-out nation. Where have I heard that before? Then again, back then there was no ascending power to oppose it.

                    Like the Evil‚Äôs greatest trick being to convince us that he doesn‚Äôt exist, the greatest trick of the jevvs has been insinuating into our minds (at first, largely those of evangelical Protestants‚Ä¶) that Judeo-Christianity is real. From that, much evil has, and continues, to flow, culturally, economically, and diplomatically.

                    That‚Äôs big.  Getting the sacrifice to sacrifice themselves, akin to getting mothers to sacrifice their children to the gods of Vanity and the Current Fad.Everything pure must be twisted, inverted, and corrupted.The Tribe is the Antichrist- its state, Israel, the entity manifested; its people, its culture, its values. This is the false god we were taught to worship.But the Bible transforms lives.How? What is the secret of its power?It provides a lineage.This is the profound power of lineage, of identity- what the Zman is speaking to.It may be the lineage of another people, but it is roots nonetheless.  Our libraries were burned so we would only have the their version.I would take our history and heritage back.  I would be of Christ, I will not be of Abraham.  He speaks for his god, not for mine.

                        For Israelis. Political terrorism has worked very well.
Perhaps people should read up on the combined strategies the Zionists used to carve out an ethno state.
Combined politics, financial leverage, bombings, assassinations  and indiscriminate terror attacks.

        Today‚Äôs post raises an important question that deserves some additional clarity. What is the proper use of ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù as we go forward into the crisis of the decline and fall of the Global American Empire?Let us first begin with what doesn‚Äôt help. Endless analysis of the core problem at the macro level is a trap. You are just spinning your wheels studying things that you simply cannot change or influence in any meaningful way. For example, praying for a political messiah to arise and fix things, and then expecting that voting harder will solve all your problems, is an example of a macro-level gambit that will never work and just keeps people dancing in a fog of endless hopefulness and failure.When disease infects the body, the solution is to fight the disease cells. A doctor will conduct an exam, perhaps do some testing, and then ‚Äúanalyze‚Äù the malady so as to implement a successful remedy. This is most often a focused analysis aimed at a specific course of action. It is typically local and serious and narrowly targeted if at all feasible. They do this because it works best most of the time.This is the correct model for curing what ails us. Analysis is best used to address specific, local, targeted remedies aimed at removing the disease cells that have been killing us in slow motion, but are now rapidity metastasizing into a Stage 4 cancer that will begin killing us rapidly if we don‚Äôt get serious soon. Smarter, not harder.

            ‚ÄúFor example, praying for a political messiah to arise and fix things,‚Ä¶‚ÄùThere has never been a time in human history that individuals did not form together under the leadership of a smaller group of individuals.  Otherwise all you have only an unorganized mob which is easily defeated in any endeavor.When you say ‚Äòfirst, fix yourself‚Ä¶‚Äô you are on solid ground, but the above sounds like a call to unorganized (organic) action.  This will never solve any problem.  Perhaps a ‚Äúmessiah‚Äù can not be summoned via the electoral process, but nevertheless nothing will change until such a person in some way distinguishes himself and comes to the forefront.

                Not at all, strong leaders are important and valuable. One could argue that Putin has lifted the Russians out of the malaise and exploitation of the post-collapse 1990s and now built a strong and formidable nation. And ideally, if we elected a strong and honorable leader to the Presidency, and that individual was somehow able to purge the Executive Branch of the Deep State Fifth Columnists, there is a chance we could experience a similar kind of rebirth. But the modeling suggests that that can only happen post-collapse, and not as part of the business-as-usual DC politics. Half of the new RINOs that will be elected next month will be corrupted within 6 months because the Deep State contagion is that strong and pervasive.The modeling further suggests that the only effective way to fight the contagion is via narrow and targeted grassroots action. And it doesn‚Äôt take much to start the stampede for the exits. Like a gunshot in the middle of a cattle herd, the reaction will be fast and pervasive. Best yet, this approach does least harm to innocents, whereas civil war will likely result in millions of casualties, including many good men on both sides.

                    Russia was in a state of collapse when Putin took over so the comparison is valid. It‚Äôs inevitable that there will a some kind of collapse, in fact it‚Äôs better that there is one to a degree. That would enable whatever comes next to repudiate the debt and establish some kind of new founding document. A collapse would be the quickest way to rid us of the invaders we have now too. Once the gibs go, they go.

With a callout he‚Äôll usually go a step back on the TomA cycle and just start darkly muttering ‚ÄúSOMETHING needs to be done!‚Äù  for a few days.  If he‚Äôs not called out he‚Äôll usually start spelling out exactly what kind of terrorism its convenient for YOU to throw your life away to do.White right wing dissidents doing targeted assasinations will really stick it to the regime and the secret police.  Everyone knows how they wish to downplay this threat and would just be aghast if white advocates started just murdering sympathetic people in their towns.

                    To be clear, for the umteenth time, I have never, and will never advocate terrorism of any sort for any purpose. That is not my message. That idea came out of Anonymous‚Äô head and reveals his mindset, not mine. He is the one fixated on that modality of action and it reflects his bias and proclivity.With respect to the cancer analogy, the best modern chemo does target specific types of cells and is not the broad blunderbuss of prior years. So it still fits my description. Also, radiation therapy is highly focused now with three computer guided lasers triangulating on a specific cancerous mass and all must be on target for it to work. Again, fits my analogy.Last, with respect to the medical remedy motif, it‚Äôs true that some medicines destroy disease cells, but others simply cause the body to pass them into waste and merely rid them from doing further harm to the host. Right now, several mayors in Texas are transporting illegal aliens to NYC. No one is being harmed, but the problem is being worked. Think outside the box.

            I think they want to force Europe into total dependence on the US to prop up the US a bit longer as the rest of the world de-dollarizes.
I think they want to do the same with Japan, but I don‚Äôt think the Japanese are as broken as the European peoples.

                Yeah, but the Europeans at least have national militaries that are actual militaries and, unlike Japan, not constitutional gimped. If/when NATO disintegrates, or the US can no longer be relied upon for defense, the Euros can fall back on their own forces. Japan, however, technically doesn‚Äôt have a military, but a self defense forces that isn‚Äôt capable of offensive operations. It‚Äôs external defense is almost entirely dependent upon the US and that was by design since just before the American occupation ended in the 1952.

            Amen, brother.We are supposedly locked in a mortal struggle to preserve our DNA and there are a lot of otherwise intelligent people who think the way to do this is to avoid identifying the enemy.  This is lunacy.  I know of no example where anyone has successfully sneaked up on a Jew.The goal is not to convert everyone in the enemy‚Äôs camp, but to split them.  Even if the gag-reflex has been conditioned out of some of them, it is clear that pattern-spotting remains.  I am thinking here of Michael Tracey, the most notorious recent convert to Hitlerism.  Now if we could only get him to shave and hit the gym‚Ä¶At this point, the paleo-cons are themselves now walking fossils, if not already under the ground.  If offending Jared Taylor‚Äôs precious sense of decorum or hurting the ailing Paul Gottfried‚Äôs feelings is the price we must pay, so be it.  If it helps, imagine a future in which there are monuments to Uncle J in every state and a public acknowledgement of Doc G as righteous among the infidels.But to behave as if we can pull this off in some oblique, passive-aggressive manner seems to me as silly as believing we can conserve our way out of this.

                The problem is that everybody has a mental circuit breaker that trips as soon as you say ‚Äúthe Jews‚Äù.  Then they ignore everything you say because you‚Äôre in the category of people not to be listened to: ‚Äúantisemite‚Äù loonies.You can actually get a normie to believe that all the war and perversion is the product of, say, ‚Äúamoral elites in finance and government‚Äù.  Once that idea is instilled, only then can you bypass the anti-semite fuse and point out how the names of all the journalists who want to cut their kids‚Äô dicks off end in a berg, stein, or witz.

                    If more people knew Jonathan Greenblatt personally, anti-semitism might be an easier sell.But most people‚Äôs experience with Jews is Al Goldstein in Accounting, who seems to be a stand up guy, and isn‚Äôt visibly receiving checks from Mossad or running the world.So, yeah, when that‚Äôs most people‚Äôs experience with Jews, you‚Äôre going to sound nuts accusing the Jews of running the world. That‚Äôs like accusing Appalachians of benefiting from White Privilege.I think the target needs to be refined. You need to be able to target people like Soros and Garland, without demanding we also pogrom poor Al from Accounting.

            If you check out any video featuring Kanye West, there are a lot of outraged blacks that he‚Äôs getting canceled. This is one of those times where the chosenites overreacted and inadvertently made more antisemites out of the process. Another Crown Heights event may be a possibility in the near future if relations between blacks and Jews continue to degrade.

            I think it‚Äôs more that Ukraine has been such a magnet for corrupt politicians to make fortunes grifting, and of course the Bidens themselves are neck deep in that, that Washington is simply incapable of giving her up.

                I think that plays into it, but it doesn‚Äôt line up with the fact that they had their proxies shell ethnic Russians for eight years as the smart play would have been to just lay low and let the shekels roll in continuously from their various graft operations.  Best guess is then is that the big players have some ulterior motive (that appears to be not very well thought out; their‚Äúcause chaos and profit from it‚Äù strategy works until it doesn‚Äôt).

Women ‚Äúmonkey branch‚Äù and in any society where they are permitted to choose and unchoose mates you will find this attraction to more economically stronger men.And why not, when women breed they pass down half their genes regardless of who supplies the other half.  The only benefit they derive is if that other half belongs to a strong provider that will assure her offspring of survival.  There‚Äôs a bit of race involved here, as in Africa, such concerns lessen as offspring survival is not so depend upon men.

            Imagine you are a global business, and your business is actually using the GAE and various European forces/agencies running billions and billions (trillions) of graft from proxy countries and regimes.Each territory is divided up into responsibility areas, business lines and and cashflows from your subsidiaries (aka known as the west)  as ‚Äúforeign aid‚Äù, local wars etc. Each one being a strategic arm of your overall business.Then say Russia decides to annex part of your marked out territory. You still want your cash, as that is the agreement. So you just bring forwards your future revenues from the US and various European tax troughs that you mark as being owed and they pay them over a shorter time using the infinite arms supply and aid narrative.

            I agree with this as well. I mentioned a similar theory in a comment a few months ago. Israel will most likely fail as the USA declines into Brazil status and can no longer protect them in unfriendly territory.
That‚Äôs why it seems like such an existential issue ‚Äì because it is, for some people.
Why specifically the Donbas region though, I‚Äôm not too sure. It seems like they could have just used the rest of Ukraine.

                Donbas has most of the coal, gas and farmland. It was an important intermediary goal for the Wehrmacht for that reason.
Also, it‚Äôs the homeland of the Khazar Jews.

                I‚Äôve honestly never considered this explanation before:  They want to establish a new Israel.  This would explain the existential urgency with which they treat this conflict.They could incorporate and harvest the beauty of the blonde Ukrainian girls like they did in Hollywood.I had just assumed that the root causes were an undying hatred for the Russians due to how the tribe was treated there historically and the desire to humiliate Russians by forcing them to praise drag queens reading stories to their children.However, this explanation does not address all the graft and corruption that the elites stand to lose if Putin gains control.  But then again, there could be multiple converging causes to explain their fanaticism about this conflict.The establishment of a new Israel does sound farfetched at first but it explains the tenacious ferocity displayed by our elites.

            When considering ethnic war motives on the American side, it‚Äôs important to remember how much the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs STINE not STEEN!‚Äù crowd despises Poles and Russians‚Äîincluding the Jewish ones.

        Well, I think the answer may be that this is a proxy war against Russia, but the real objective is to send a message to China. Unfortunately, in the minds of the Elite it‚Äôs all linked now and showing weakness in one area jeopardizes other theaters of action. This ‚Äúlinkage‚Äù was thought to be a relic of the Cold War, but it‚Äôs back like vinyl records and bourbon.Meanwhile, we may scoff at the Chinese geezers on stage the other day. But at least the Chinese know who is running their country. There are 7 people, probably geezers, running the US but we don‚Äôt know who they are and they won‚Äôt be on any ballot.

            Jack Boniface: ‚ÄúHow will the neocons react?‚ÄùZ: ‚ÄúThe interesting bit here is how quickly the hammer came down. The Biden White House and senior party members held an emergency meeting and then threatened the progressive caucus with death if they did not recant. We do not know the exact nature of the threats, but the speed with which the apostates recanted and their groveling tone suggest genuine fear. Whatever was said to them was serious enough to have them groveling in public within hours.‚ÄùThe other day, over at PA World &amp; Times, PA had said that the Frankfurt School ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù wh@ck Kanye [without ‚Äúcatastrophic backblow‚Äù].And I replied that my best guess would be that David Barnea and the gang have already drawn up plans to wh@ck Kanye, and now they just need the formal approval of a full gathering of the Sanhedrin before they can move ahead with the plans.And the Sanhedrin might have already voted on it during one of the myriad October holy days [Yom Kippur or Sukkot or Shemini Atzeret or Simchat Torah].But then there‚Äôs a two month layoff until they meet again for Hanukkah, in December.===============Z: ‚ÄúJust in case anyone missed the point, the regime then sent Bernie Sanders out to chastise the progressives for being wrong. Sanders has spent his life railing against the military industrial complex. He has opposed every military action, even those sponsored by his party. Now he sounds like Bill Kristol after a few too many drinks.‚ÄùThis gets back to a point I used to have a great deal of difficulty making with folks [although lately, many more people are starting to understand this point which I‚Äôve been trying to make all these years]: That there isn‚Äôt a dime‚Äôs worth of difference between an ostensible ‚Äúfree-marketeer‚Äù, such as David Ricardo, and an ostensible ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù, such as Karl Marx.They‚Äôre both just sooth-saying mesmerizing hypnotizing con-men who prey on your psychological weaknesses.Ricardo manipulates your greed; Marx manipulates your envy.And both of them laugh all the way to the bank [which they also just happen to own].

            That is why I suspect the politicians are being gas lighted more than the public. They are being told that the Russian army is collapsing and the Russian economy is ready to topple any day. One more final push by the Ukrainian army and victory is at hand. Something similar happened with Afghanistan.
The proof for me on this is was the pipeline bombing. It was clear that the Biden admin was caught off-guard. They did not have a narrative ready. Something similar was probably in the works with the dirty bomb, until the Russian sounded the alarm.

            I think the Russians waited too long to address the Ukraine problem. I also think they made an error in thinking they could strike a deal with the West once the war started. They badly miscalculated. They also failed to play in the arena of public relations. The Chinese are very smart about buying off people in Washington who then promote a friendly China policy. Russia did not do that and it cost them.

I think Russia spent their time preparing to handle the economic sanctions. The price of oil plummeted from 2014 to this year, and the 2014 coup was likely Russia‚Äôs red line. With the failure in Afghanistan, skyrocketing price of oil and gas, western economic self-destruction, and the silly people in the executive branch, this was the ideal time for Russia to make a move. Any earlier and I don‚Äôt know that Putin would have survived the sanctions.

                    But then you get things that appear to not be a real war.
Russia and ukraine say there are attacks on electricity infrastructure. Lets say they are real.
But according to the Russian telegram guys they don‚Äôt hit the large transformers (one of the few things that can‚Äôt be easily repaired) and at the same time Transnistria (the Russian  breakaway part of Moldova) is supplying Ukraine with 30% of its power and helping stabilize the Grid after the rolling blackouts.
All appears very odd.

                        The message has, however been sent; the Russians have elected to not take out the least repairable segments of the grid, but their ability to do so has been demonstrated. As to the Transnistrians, they are not  physically in contact with Russian-controlled territory, so they play it softly. But if in the coming offensive, the balance of the Black Sea coastline becomes Russian-controlled, and contact is established, things change.

            Yeah. The fact that Putin has managed to annex territories of Ukraine without getting censure from china, India or Saudi Arabia is amazing. You know if he‚Äôd done that in the early days the hammer would have come down immediately. He‚Äôs been very cautious about keeping his allies as allies.  The days of Russia negotiating with Washington are over but their days are negotiating with everyone else are just beginning

                China, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia (and Iran) all want to conquer and annex certain areas on their borders. That is their common cause, and the basis of their coalescing alliance.
A clever american president would exploit natural divisions in those quite different countries (such as russian paranoia about china, Iran vs Saudi religious differences, etc) to prevent them from coordinating, but ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù (or whoever is running things) seems to  deliberately want to unite the entire world against the U.S.
And they appear to be succeeding.
The next few decades are going to be tough.

                    It‚Äôs pretty easy to unite the world against the U.S. when we constantly behave like war-mongering bullies.  Biden managed to seriously damage our relationship with Saudi Arabia with that kind of behavior.

        I would suggest that the regime cannot drop Ukraine for the same reason they could not drop Trump. In both cases there were useful and easy deals to be made, but the regime could not tolerate the existence of either and viewed both as implacable, existential threats.

        The Ukraine War is fundamentally a neocon Jewish War.   The elites in that group have always set their sights on Russia and they nearly completed their takeover but Putin stopped it.
The progressive democrats will of course grovel back and repent.  What group can the political apparatus or entertainment industry not go against or criticize?   Kanye found out did he not?

        Meanwhile, at the other end of the world, the new entire Chinese Politburo Standing Committee is over 60, with 5/7 over 65.
Not sure how aged the Russian leadership is. But most of the world is now under the rule of senior citizens.

            I think it is fairly normal for leaders to be in their 60‚Äôs. It is not until your 40‚Äôs that you have demonstrated the ability to one day be in leadership. By that point there is a line and you compete with others for your shot. The issue we see in Washington is everyone is over 70 and many are pushing 80.
I have said for years that the age limit for the Senate should be 50-to-70 and the House 40-to-60. Mandatory retirement for all government workers is 72. Maybe bump it to 75 given modern medicine.

            China does a good job vetting talent in the party by assigning progressively more difficult areas of responsibility.
It‚Äôs not without its flaws, but you don‚Äôt get ridiculous outcomes like TV personalities, dementia patients, or stroke victims in positions of real power.

                Yes, I was of that persuasion myself‚Äîexcept now we have Xi who awhile back manipulated the rule of only two five year terms as President.  He is now elected to a third term.  (IIRC)So, Xi is like 70 yo and perhaps he‚Äôll die before a 4th term.  However, there are other, younger Xi‚Äôs in the wings that might also server a 3rd term, and then a fourth and so forth.  Are we on a progression to a de facto dictatorship?These situations always seem to arise when there is a pretty good guy serving and then folks bend the rules to allow such a leader to stay and then his replacement turns out to be Caligula.
