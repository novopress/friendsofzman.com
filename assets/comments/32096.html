        We are the authors of our own misery.Why are there so many blacks in Africa? Because whites feed them and they breed like flies. Whites set up hospitals and clinics for people that believe in spirits, curses and witch doctors. So more is fed to them, and the result is more blacks that need to be fed. An old stubfart blogger named Kim du Toit became a radioactive pariah and heretic when he penned a screed entitled ‚ÄúLet Africa Sink‚Äù. And 20 years later ‚Äì here is our own esteemed blogger repeating the heresy!üòÇüëçBut‚Ä¶they‚Äôre both right. If blacks were left to themselves in Africa ‚Äì famine, wars, disease and Mother Nature would thin them out to manageable, stable numbers. Eventually numbers would build up again, and nature would take its course. The black man evolved to live and die in this life cycle. As did other borderline Neolithic races.Whitey has evolved past ‚Äúliving in harmony with the environment‚Äù. Coming largely from less hospitable climes, he learned to modify the environment maintain stable numbers. If you insist on replacing him and trying to hurt him‚Ä¶you‚Äôll ultimately hurt the other races too.Race realities are going to reassert themselves once this artificial bubble of prosperity collapses.

            Sailer had his Most Important Graph up for years, that Africa population hockey stick.NGOs look at that and salivate over the liberal-mandated grifting opportunities being handed to them.
The above example echoes the baleful free market, open borders, wishful thinking of the Insulated Useful Idiots found on college campuses, often with tenure. The canny ones wangle grant writers to keep the dough rising, forresearch.

                The most important graph is *only* important because in presumes the fleeing hoards of Africa will meet little resistance from the Western nations.  This is a valid fear and a good guess.  However, a closure of the borders to such is not an impossibility even for a shrinking West, and the African hoards will never be able through force of arms breach a determined West.  There just isn‚Äôt the IQ power.  The problem of a growing Africa will solve itself in a couple generations‚Äîtops‚Äîif Western aid stops and refugees to the West are halted.Harsh I admit, but the alternative is an end of the West as we know it.

                The problem with Sailer‚Äôs graph, and in general, is that no nation in Africa can feed itself, so all this growth is dependent on food imports from the first world‚Ä¶mainly Russia, the US, Canada, and some countries in South America‚Ä¶Those exports will not continue indefinitely, as the West continues to destroy farm land and impose restrictions on it because of the Global Warming fraud‚Ä¶.So the whole system is going to collapse at some point‚Ä¶

                    What‚Äôs ironic is if you have any black friends, they keep telling each other that everyone is trying to depopulate Africa.  I wish that were true.  We literally quadrupled their population with free shit.

            I too subscribe to this dismal theory; I‚Äôm not sure if it has an official name but civilizational collapse will do for now.¬†It may be worth noting that Whites too will take huge damage in the big crash, if and when it comes.The present world is unsustainable, and that would likely remain the case even if population grows slowed to zero, which I‚Äôm pretty sure it hasn‚Äôt. As noted, the poorest places breed prolifically and the only reason they aren‚Äôt already visited more than they are by war, famine and pestilence is due to aid from the rich world. In exchange, of course, for the continued opportunity to rape the poor nations for whatever natural resources and other wealth that can be stripped from them.

                ‚Äú..opportunity to rape the poor nations for whatever natural resources and other wealth that can be stripped from them.‚Äù
That‚Äôs a tired old trope.  It takes two as they say.  There is no ‚Äúrape‚Äù without connivance of corrupt elites‚Äîcertainly since the end of colonialism.  Additionally I would challenge anyone to point to a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù country that has been raped to the point that their ‚Äúnatural resources‚Äù have been extinguished.  Rather what we see mainly today are bunches of 3rd world countries with great resources that are squandered through ignorance and greed‚Äîbut not our ignorance and greed, theirs.

            Kim du Toit
du Toit was also an anti-apartheid activist in his younger days and refuses to disavow that. He left his fellow South Africans behind to suffer the effects of what he pushed for. He‚Äôdseemall red-pilled about Africa, but he‚Äôd never take the side of Whites in their own country.

                True. I don‚Äôt consider him a dissident in the way we understand the term. He‚Äôs always been an old Boomer that can sometimes peer into the workings of the Matrix, but will never see the big picture. If you were to point all that out to him, V‚Ä¶ the response would almost certainly be cognitive dissonance and hypocrisy.Nevertheless, he is one of the first to challenge the black/Africa narratives of the time by speaking the truth about it. Not defending him‚Ä¶but for me‚Ä¶I think of some of the things that I used to believe and just want to die of embarrassment sometimes. People get caught up in these warm fuzzy narratives and they go in with the best of intentions. Coming to This Side of politics and philosophy is not as easy for some as it is with others.

                        food, water and shelter.  it is the primitive recurrence seen and all that is needed to survive.  we have it and lots of it.   california alone grows 80% of the worlds fruits and nuts.  i grew up poor in california, but never hungry.  i could walk any alley in my neighborhood and eat my fill of strawberry‚Äôs, oranges, mandarins, plums, apricots, avocados, almonds ,walnuts, etc‚Ä¶  it is literally rotting on the ground daily.  just a matter of walking the alleys and pick what is hanging.  when the earth serves up this kind of cornucopia, people tend to stay and fiercely protect.  i remember as a kid in the early 60s, trying to figure out why neighbors would allow their crop to rot on the ground.  think the neighbors were glad someone was eating it.

            ‚ÄúPeaceful separation would be ideal, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it.‚ÄùIn exactly three decades, the locale I live in changed due to fedgov policies. Aided and abetted by locals, slum lords, corrupt law enforcement and their ilk.We buy a house in a bucolic setting, albeit one hour from a major city. Still, country, local Main Street, all the trappings. Quiet.First come the illegals. A horde of them to such an extent that Main Street now features Spanish as the first language and we avoid ‚Äògoing through‚Äô what is now a barrio.Then came the Section 8 housing, now the town has a population of the folks that come with that. Many just seem to wander around.Local hardware store, movie theater‚Ä¶ gone or boarded up. The ‚Äòfood‚Äô? Please, not one place worth eating out at ‚Äî they serve you cold food, bad food, and have this certain ‚Äòfake nice‚Äô that our new citizens think they effect when hand is out for $$ but anyone with IQ over 90 can see through.Due to proximity to blue city, property ‚Äòvalues‚Äô continue to rise ‚Äî and sakes alive, the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô of said property boosts school taxes through the roof.Local population? Mostly sheep, brainwashed, bleating the most pathetic programming. The ‚Äòseparation‚Äô in hand is simple. These city folks move up, then its ‚Äòcan you jump my car‚Äô or ‚Äòdrain is clogged‚Äô or similar. They are helpless.You help, but once they reveal their TDS or similar, help ends. Friendly wave? Yes. Nothing more. And yes, we plan to get out.As for these little men and their lawn care, home repairs‚Ä¶ I wonder, once the Gringo is gone, are they going to make a ca$h living doing this work for one another???

                    I just looked at the demographic change in Brewster from 1990 until today. Incredible. Hispanics are now 61% of the population. It looks like they simply moved in and added to the existing population, which jumped by 38% from 1990 to 2000 alone.
It looks like the future of America right there. Once the old whites in that area start dying out and others move out, it‚Äôll start tilting toward 70, 75% by 2030. Basically, by 2040 at the latest (50 years) it will go from an all-white village to a small all-Hispanic town.
GONE. In just five decades. Gutted.

                Cruciform:  This sort of demographic change is happening everywhere and it is all by design  Just returned from a quick visit to the big city we abandoned a year ago.  The pace of change ‚Äì all negative ‚Äì is staggering.  Half the stores and restaurants closed; the other half are full of diversity ‚Äì and yet I read of massive credit card bill delinquencies.  Friends‚Äô neighborhood used to be majority White ‚Äì now they are one of two White households in a block of 15.  Their friends in a $700k house a few miles away just had Blackrock lease the house behind them to a group of single diverse males ‚Äì who catcall the wife and hang on the fence trying to talk to his not-quite pubescent daughters.  He has had to work from home to protect them, because the ‚Äúthin blue line‚Äù won‚Äôt do anything until an actual ‚Äòcrime‚Äô is committed ‚Äì and targeting White children is not a crime in AINO.We praise God daily for facilitating our move.  Power was out when we left due to storms, but our generator was running and we passed over two dozen electric work trucks on our way out of town.  Meanwhile, the storms followed us to DFW.  The very night we arrived my husband mused ‚ÄúWhat are all these people going to do when the power goes out?‚Äù  And next morning about 5:30 AM ‚Äì storm ensued.  We had to change hotels (no power/ac/internet).  Husband‚Äôs employer‚Äôs main office ‚Äì no powerrestoration until the weekend.  Various co-workers lost the contents of their fridges and freezers.  All but the main traffic lights were out.All the hotel and restaurant workers were black and/or mestizo.  Mixture of indifferent to hostile.  Found one or two exceptions who went out of their way to be of assistance but whole environment feels alien.  We treasure our now heritage American locale, but the native Whites here just have no concept of how endangered they are.

            Don‚Äôt you worry. Radical, VAST changes are coming soon, and the diversity problem will be whisked away, almost as if it never happened. We who survive it all will have *much* more basic concerns to deal with every day.

            Yes, that‚Äôs an excellent observation. From one viewpoint, in the old days (e.g. before the massive legislative juggernaut that was Civil Rights) individual groups had far more freedom of association, which is simply another name for peaceful separation. To be sure, it was often accomplished by legal means like the Jim Crow laws. Yet much of it, perhaps most, was simply private groups asserting the freedom of exclusion in their private affairs. (Legal discriminations like racial covenants in deeds or other legal contracts are a middle ground between those two extremes, in my view.) If a private club, the owner of a retail establishment, or any other 100% private organization doesn‚Äôt have freedom of choice in who he allows upon his private property, or is otherwise prone to interact with, he doesn‚Äôt really have much liberty, does he?Our nation, and perhaps others, were founded upon implicit and at times explicit (e.g. how various levels of government were set up) powers of self-governing. With time government became more intrusive, meaning among other things that a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù rule had to be imposed upon smaller groups who until then had enjoyed the liberty of running things as they saw fit. Of course, States‚Äô or other rights still exist in various guises. Still, I think anyone would be hard-pressed to name a single place where Federal control has been returned to a State in modern times.

                I know I‚Äôve mentioned this before, but I started in Rotary right around the time women began making inroads into the corporate world.  Of course, Rotary (along with most of the other significant service clubs) were male only. Well, that just couldn‚Äôt be cause the gals wouldn‚Äôt have access to the ‚Äúold boys network‚Äù.  So the yammering began and the organization folded up like wet paper bag.  It‚Äôs going to take a lot of testicular fortitude to roll all that crap (and more) back.

            There will be separation.  The questions are when, how, how much area and where, violent or peaceful, etc.  So much is unknown, but nature and reality says living together in multi-racial, chaotic, tense, low-trust, society will not and cannot continue.

                A couple days ago Tyler Zed, a sort of dissident-lite YouTube guy based in MN, was talking about Greater Idaho. That‚Äôs the name the counties in Oregon are taking as they try to secede from Oregon and join Idaho. Tyler seems to think this thing could actually happen and speculates that if GI happens there will be a lot of similar movements in the Red parts of CA, CO, etc‚Ä¶I certainly hope he‚Äôs right. The problem, though, is that the high taxes that are listed as perhaps the main complaint from the rural counties get funneled almost exclusively to the Blue hives which dominate state politics. In the event that GI breaks away from OR, the result will be a large and very rural Red state with low taxes and social distress.What‚Äôs left of Blue OR then becomes a rump state that has to finance all its own degeneracy. The problem is that OR is already struggling to keep basically *any* business in the state due to the high taxes. If the split happens, virtually all of the remaining viable businesses will move 100 miles East and be done with it.So what‚Äôs not to like? Right? Well, the problem is that the Blue hives now have a large population that is accustomed to a life of easy freebies, cheap legal hard drugs, liberal coddling of criminals and all the rest. Even many Portland/Salem I-5 libs are actually in favor of this since they‚Äôre tired of having all those rural counties obstructing their Socialist paradise. The real elite that controls the political class is surely aware that no matter how popular this kind of division may be across the ideological spectrum, it‚Äôs not really that practical. Thus they will look for any way, no matter how nasty, to hold the state together. This argument of course, applies to the nation as a whole.This is why, even if separation is overwhelmingly popular on both Left and Right, there will still be plenty of dirty tricks and outright violence to keep the country (and all its dysfunctional and unhappy states) together. Note that this doesn‚Äôt mean I oppose separation.

        People who couldn‚Äôt get along with their European homelands, or those seeking adventure, came to America.People who couldn‚Äôt work in early colonial society, or those with dreams of land, went West.Those who wanted to avoid ethnic rivalries congregated to their own ethnic conclaves in the city.When ethnic conclaves in the city were destroyed, they retreated to the suburbs.Now the suburbs are under attack, every small town is introduced to diversity with Section 8, and the government is confiscating all the frontier land they can.Whites have always run to just be left alone, and now there‚Äôs nowhere left to run.

            Moreover, almost the entirety of their middle class is wholly dependent upon racial wealth transfers taken from whites.Of course, this will put more strain on the proportionalist system. De facto reparations are being paid now. First LaGuardia and now JFK will be enhanced/expanded and no white men are eligible for contracts ‚Äì not a penny. Boston is going to pay reparations. A town in PA just pulled a NY JFK with several billion.It won‚Äôt be long before non-blacks wonder why they are paying reparations and then begin to demand the lion‚Äôs share of the spoils.The same is bound to happen at the federal level. Today, the IDF is the uniform of choice and now extending VA benefits to Israeli veterans from US taxpayers is the order of the day. The Muslim factions are already rousing their mobs and making rumblings about supporting their homelands. Congressional debate sometimes looks more like a catfight at an urban nail and eyelash salon.Even when a white person brings more fame and more money to a niche entertainment like the WNBA, rather than sharing in the spoils the way everyone did when a Negro made a sport more popular through athletic prowess, the whites must be torn down and denigrated.The Fabric of Society is already in tatters. Down in the cargohold the cargo is shifting and banging around. Up in the cockpit, the pilots in a nosedive take their caviar and champagne after another orgy. They get on the mic and tell the cabin that there is still a long time before the ground is near. Relax and enjoy the movies ‚Äì this one is free. The in-air tattoo salon line swells and the complimentary children‚Äôs trans lap story time goes on in the emergency aisle in 20 minutes.The movie shows black people running everything and evil rednecks being dragged off to camps as happy white women wag their fingers at them. The white passengers in the bedraggled mix of races look uneasy and you can see them look around counting heads to see what kind of numbers they have. Somewhere in that crowd are men who have had enough and make plans to go up to the cockpit and sort things out.

            ‚ÄúThe American Negro‚Äù by E. Frazier was published in the late 1940‚Äôs. It‚Äôs really interesting to read his quite open account of black promiscuity, illegitimacy and crime from slavery through the 40‚Äôs.The conclusion he draws, though, is that blacks will have better outcomes once white people overcome prejudice.

        Not possible in a world where blacks have the legal right to murder Whites. D.C, Lagos, and Birmingham did not become black Hellscapes through cunning, but through state-sanctioned violence. Whites were driven out of their historical neighborhoods through violence and those neighborhoods became exclusively black. Peaceful separation is, in fact, wildly optimistic.

            I see the managerial elite system as simply a tool of the Tribe. The managerial elite is mostly just human cattle stampeded in whatever direction the Tribes media/edumacation system points them. I learned at Unz about another book that was part of the erased resistance of our forefathers to Jewish rape of America: ‚ÄúThe Iron Curtain over America by John Beaty (1951).‚Äù That was also where I learned about Henry Ford‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe International Jew‚Äù (1931).Yes, it‚Äôs not all of them (Unz is Jewish, and doing Godly work), but it is consistently some of them wherever they go. Faction balancing in response to empire (small groups/states putting aside their difference to cooperate against a common threat) is an old term in international relations. Historically, balancing responses against empires have always been regional. However, the ‚Äòsome‚Äô which have mutilated America into the centerpiece of their planetary empire have now galvanized a planet-wide balancing response that, unfortunately for us, is mostly directed against us.Putin‚Äôs comments at Valdai strongly suggest that Russians know what the true state of play is (in which case you can be damn sure that the Chinese and Indians know, too), and hopefully if the war spreads their missile targeting will take that into account. It is the power behind the authority in our Western neoliberal fake democracies which must be forced to the negotiating table. The individuals in authority. e.g. Macron, are whores who will do as they are told by power.

                Yes, that makes sense. The Tribe has set up a structure where worthy white cucks can be promoted to NCO rank. But always contingent on continued good behavior. Macron and Schulz are NCOs.

                    Absolutely. Magnificent.
For instance, I learned last night that ‚ÄúUkrainian‚Äù Nikita Khrushchev‚Äôs real name wasSolomon Pearl Mutter, married to a Ukrainian Banderite wife.
Also, that the former name of ‚Äúthe Borderlands‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Plain‚Äù was New Serbia and Slaveno-Serbia until 1750.
The good news is, the Unzes are the heirs to a previous vanguard such as Gottfried and Irving. May they prove to be the new elite to overthrow the old, amongst their own as we must ours. These acorns, we must shelter and succor.

                            That was the claim.  Here are the full paragraphs.‚ÄúAll those who consider Ukraine to be a real country are simply ridiculous. It is no longer ignorance but a pathology.I have already said that at the time when the Serbs founded two provinces where is now Ukraine (around 1750) ‚Äì New Serbia and Slaveno-Serbia, Ukrainians did not even exist.It would be fair to return those original names soon and to replace some meaningless, so-called ‚ÄòBorderland‚Äô (Ukraine).Ukraine was created by Lenin, who we know what he was.Do we know who the ‚ÄòUkrainian‚Äô Nikita Khrushchev, who succeeded Stalin, was? Anyone? Of course we don‚Äôt know. But we can guess from his real name ‚ÄìSolomon Pearl Mutter.He was married to a Ukrainian woman from the Bandera family. He gave Crimea to Ukraine after one drunken night (how ridiculous are those ‚Äòlegalists‚Äô who still claim that Crimea is a legal part of something called Ukraine).He also released all the Bandera‚Äôs prisoners who were sentenced to long-term and life-term prison terms.‚Äù‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄìNo name or link kept in my disjointed notes; also please note I‚Äôve seen this ‚ÄòMutter‚Äô claim mentioned before.I was pondering the relation of several puzzles; more later, if I may, as I am tedious.I think I‚Äôve solved (or at least better comprehend) Jack Dobson‚Äôs mystery of the Judeo-Puritans.Rather, they are a prime example of a universal mechanism applicable to any demographic re the problem of the elites.  (One that further illumines the ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô mechanics that underlay the organic as well.)

        The separation of Whites fleeing diverse areas has mostly been conducted in a way to avoid being thought of as a racist. Typically it‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äôre moving to a better school district.‚ÄùRecently a friend in Minnesota told me about a proposed new housing development in a mostly white, outer suburb of the Twin Cities, Lino Lakes.  It‚Äôs called the Madinah Lakes Project, and features a big mosque at the center of it. If approved, Lino Lakes would have a large number of Somalians moving out to their nice white suburb.There is a lot of opposition to the new development, but the reasons cited are things like traffic, overcrowding and water resources. The supporters say it‚Äôs Islamophobia, which the opposition vehemently denies.So far White America is still terrified of being honest and open about why they prefer to not live in diverse areas. But that‚Äôs about to change soon I think‚Ä¶.

            In the Twin Cities, diversity mandates for new construction are enforced by the Metropolitan Council, which was formed in the ‚Äô60s/‚Äô70s to facilitate the construction of the freeway system. The original idea was to form a multi-county governance structure that could override local zoning laws which might interfere with the construction of the freeway system. It was successful for a few decades, but as per O‚ÄôSullivan‚Äôs law it eventually was taken over by the political left.One of the powers granted the Met Council was management of the water systems for the metropolitan counties. Now, any developer in these metropolitan counties must reserve a certain portion of the project for low-income/diverse housing as a condition of receiving water and sewer permits. No diversity, no permits.The Met Council is wholly undemocratic. Members of the Council are appointed by the Governor and are in no way accountable to the residents of the district they ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù. Of the 17 members of the Met Council, there are two white men. It‚Äôs obvious how this ends.

        There are huge headwinds to a formal policy of peaceful separation. Of the biggest are absolutely moronic opposition leaders:https://amgreatness.com/2024/05/29/taking-back-california-part-five-abundant-water/These guys have been doing a series on how to take back California. At this point, using Anglo-Saxon values, ideas and gentlemanly persuasion to take back California to an American region is no different than trying to do the same with Guatemala. It isn‚Äôt going to happen, yet they are going to waste pen, paper, time, money and energy on this stupidity.While they are writing this series, blacks in California‚Äôs legislature is accelerating/escalating formal plans to give blacks reparations.As for The Great Sort, a de facto peaceful separation, it is happening. Yet, at the same time, the government is shipping third world flesh sacks in droves all over the country. One of us, has to find a good property, get a good deal, find a way to pay for it one at a time. Meanwhile, Mayorkas and HIAS push thousands wherever they want and pay for these horde‚Äôs housing, food, clothing and month-to-month sustenance.That isn‚Äôt a headwind, it is a tsunami, and it is being created on purpose.Have you ever been to Sioux Falls South Dakota? I went there a while back. I expected to find farmers, industrial supply and repair work all done by a small population ‚Äì of Americans. I arrived to find it contains a Mogadishu and a Khartoum. The hotel I stayed at hosted one of those two alien people‚Äôs wedding parties. GDP went up and the stock of that Hotel Group stayed afloat for more buybacks!! The downtown of this once pious, industrious, Germanic people‚Äôs downtown is taken over by shitlibs. The all-colors-but-white flag was everywhere and all businesses had the, ‚ÄúWe Welcome Everyone (Except white men, Christians and traditionalists‚Äù, in its window. I might as well have been in San Francisco‚Äôs Castro District. No. It was even more gay than The Castro, and I do not exaggerate.I mean, when Americans have to run from Sioux Falls South Dakota, where are you going to go to peacefully separate? And, the ratchet is tightening. The WSJ just ran a piece on why West Virginia doesn‚Äôt have any immigration and how that is an outrage. I mean, their economy is decimated for the existing residents. So the solution is to dump endless hordes into West Virginia?So, when peaceful separation isn‚Äôt an option it looks like we are back to option one in today‚Äôs list.The crime being committed by The Ruling Regime of the post-West is so egregious so outrageous so utterly evil and vile that it is beyond even comprehension. I would be optimistic if The Regime was just waging economic and cultural war against us. That they are dumping what they say will be an unending stream of human beings into our territory as their empire is collapsing and they Rock In The Free World in a bar band gives me no cause for being optimistic at all.There is another reality that The Regime is aware of. That is that populations capitulate. When a territory is invaded the leaders of the invasion lead their force to overwhelm and destroy the current population. It just so happens that the leaders of this invading force is our own Ruling Regime. That doesn‚Äôt change that reality. There is also the reality of post-modernity. This isn‚Äôt a mostly agrarian society where the natives are bound to the land and deeply steeped in their cultures, traditions and ancestral ways.This is a 250 year old shopping mall where huge swaths of the natives have no identity, no will, no past to call upon. They just have an aspiration to get a house, fill it with things and to passively watch multi-millionaires hostile to them play children‚Äôs games.The Regime know this. That is also a part of our reality. We should not be so arrogant to think The Regime is stupid. They are going to impose a reality upon us and force it to be accepted. The only hope we have, is that the reality of their empire and its weight comes crashing in on them and does so in a time frame where we have been amply organized and there is still time left to use that organization to salvage something that can look like what things looked like even just 45 years ago.

            I agree with everything you said here. I‚Äôve often been looked at as a doomer because I choose to live in reality. There‚Äôs no fixing this, and there is nowhere to go.

You are not changing their minds or fixing them. They must be ‚Äúremoved‚Äù.

        Being from the northeast, a former steel city, I was surprised how integrated blacks were driving through the south for the first time to Florida in the late 90‚Äôs.I was always lead to believe (falsly as it turns out) in the north blacks were more free to integrate, and of course the southern rebels would keep things segregated as best they could, even under the feds forced integration. Well its the exact opposite. The southerners have been living side by side with large swaths of blacks for centuries. They are acclimated to it. In the north east, blacks and whites simply segregate themselves into zones / neighborhoods by and large without a whole lot of hand wringing.Blacks in the south although there are ‚Äúhoods,‚Äù you‚Äôll find them in sizable numbers in small rural towns, and suburbs.Having recently spent almost a year living in florida, i expected to find cubans / hispanics interspersed among whites. But the brothers are equally interspersed. I left a good paying job and moved back to rural Western NY because I refuse to deal.The criminality in south florida is off the charts.Instead of segregating ourselves I‚Äôd rather we take our culture and country back. Both for the principle of it, and we are running out if places to run too.White man runs, the deep, dark, righteous tanned clan follows.Because they can‚Äôt survive without our resources.

                No, it‚Äôs not salvageable. New York is a lost cause. Completely. Rural New York may be white but the legislature is controlled by Negroes and Jews from New York City and it has an insufferable left-wing whore for a governor.
But Vinny has a valid point. The north and the Rust Belt is extremely segregated. I live in a small town that is so white a Southern Klansman would think he had died and gone to heaven here.
Twenty miles away in the city‚Ä¶ it might as well be Africa.

                It‚Äôs why I am staying. This is where I grew up, it‚Äôs where I plan to die. It‚Äôs a beautiful region, as you say. It‚Äôs Trump country too. Living outside of Rochester, I can drive in any direction to a bordering state, or Canada for that matter, without going much out of the way, avoiding the Orwellian surveillance of the Thruway (originally to have been toll-free by 1997 -haha, joke‚Äôs on us, I guess, thanks Pataki), through delightful and varied countryside, interspersed with historic little towns, and nary a ‚ÄúWhat We Believe‚Äù sign to be seen. No end of Trump flags and signs though, sometimes writ large across the face of barns.

        If have a friend that grew up in St. Louis. He went to the community college in Forrest Park. He is of Austrian descent, he was friends with all the Italians, went to church with all the Italians, and worked with the Italians. He couldn‚Äôt get an apartment on ‚ÄúThe Hill‚Äù because he wasn‚Äôt Italian. I don‚Äôt know how it is today, but ‚ÄúThe Hill‚Äù was a nice safe place in a sea $hit.As an aside, I was designing a large infrastructure project for a White suburban town and had to hold public meetings (stupid government contract). Public meetings that no one came to. I asked the local mayor and he said that if I wanted people to show up that I needed to advertise that we were constructing Section 8 housing. He said the whole town would show up. This was twenty years ago. People know even if they don‚Äôt say it out loud.

            I live within a small school district in a wealthy neighborhood.  I use such arguments regularly.  It is a very simple problem of running the number of how a couple hundred section 8 housing units would produce 400+ student in a district of 2000 or so  students.  From there some percentages can be produced.  There are studies to show a decline in school efficiency/function/quality/safety when the minority enrollment tops 5%.  20% is a death knell.

            I grew up close to the Hill and was in high school when the desegregation orders came down from a Missouri judge in the late 1970s.  The black northside schools and white southside schools were forced to mix through a bussing program.  Of course, chaos ensued, and white families moved out of the city and into surrounding counties in large numbers.  The city population has dropped from 470K prior to desegregation to 277K today.  The racial makeup went from about 50/50 to 12% white today.  This backs Zman‚Äôs point, and shows that segregation will always re-emerge once the liberal do-gooders lose their power.

        I think the failure of multiracialism is very likely for a number of convergent reasons.First is the fading memory of the historical events and the literal death of the generations that created, for the first time ever, social engineering on a global scale. Namely, Mustache Guy‚Äôs 1939-1945 racial bloodbath, which created the dominance of racial ‚Äúreformers‚Äù who used WWII as a club to beat race realists without mercy in the postwar era. This led directly to the end of formal colonialism worldwide and formal segregation in the United States. The ‚ÄúCivil Rights‚Äù movement could not have taken the form it did without the memory of 1933-1945 fresh in the minds. However, as the Bagels are learning to their sorrow, invoking the specters of 1945 and Jim Crow do have a sell by date. To all the generations born after the Boomers, those events are not living memories, and to Zoomers, might as well be in the Stone Age. The MunichPutsch, which I mentioned yesterday, is now a full century in the past. The battles over segregation began 70 years ago. The SS died in 1945, and the Klan in the 1960s. There‚Äôs been four generations now who know nothing but ‚ÄúTolerance‚Äù and ‚ÄúDiversity‚Äù and all the propaganda for the post racial utopia, not the Bad Old Days when saintly People of Color couldn‚Äôt chimp out everywhere. That brings up the second thread.The grand experiment of desegregation, decolonization, and a ‚Äúpost racial‚Äù utopia, enforced literally at the point of a gun, has been shown to be an abject failure, especially with respect to the obsolete farm equipment. There‚Äôs no way to pretend otherwise, looking at the ruins of once great American cities once Negroes gain control. Watching Haiti devolve into a literal cannibal state once again, despite being independent for well over two centuries, can‚Äôt be blamed on Whitey anymore. People are beginning to question the entire premise of the racial dreamers, and coming to the conclusion that possibly our ancestors were right all along, that Africans are incapable of living according to the norms of European society, and must be subordinated to prevent chaos and ensure quality of life.

        From Zman‚Äôs lips to God‚Äôs ear. The rising tide of immigrant mediocrity, coupled with the genocidal sense of entitlement unleased by the egalitarian lotus eaters, has stripped American white men of the fruits of their civilization-building efforts. If we are to enjoy peace once again, majority rule and universal suffrage must end. Apartheid now, each neighborhood and then town or city in turn. Redlining, sundowner laws, preferential hiring and business deals, social shunning and free association. All the old tools need to be employed, but latently rather than by explicit measures. Every effort by the Feds, the NGOs and the charities to ‚Äúenrich‚Äù our communities through the blandishments of grant money and ‚Äútasty ethnic food‚Äù must be rejected as the slow poison that they are to the body politic.

        James Madison had the solution to this problem in 1787.He discussed ‚Äúthe mischiefs of faction‚Äù quite eloquently in Federalist #10. His solution to the problem was to createa federal system of diverse states and a central government of strictly limited and enumerated powers.Unfortunately the federal government that he created became the monster that ate the Constitution. Under Lincoln, the federal government, in search of a reason to kill Southern white people and destroy their political power, decided that Negro slavery gave it the moral justification to do so.The federal government has used forced racial ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù and equality to justify its global rampage and repression of rights ever since. The federal government is a totalitarian monster that is going to cram diversity down your throat at gunpoint whether you want it or not.

        ‚ÄúYes, people with vastly different cultures and belief systems can get along. It does happen. But the opposite is much more common. As Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok observed in a talk to representatives of international organizations:‚ÄòI have asked my ministry this and I will pose the question here as well. Give me an example of a multi-ethnic or multi-cultural society in which the original population still lives, and where there is a peaceful cohabitation. I don‚Äôt know of one.‚ÄôIf you‚Äôve got social division, then deal with it as well as you can. Avoid doing anything that would make the situationworseby creating even more diversity. Manage the problems you have, but don‚Äôt go looking for more of them.‚Äù‚ÄîWhy Sane People Believe Crazy Things: How Belief Can Help or Hurt Social Peace

                I visited Singapore several times during my imperial service.Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. It was MUCH nicer than the state in which I grew up (b/c no blacks, of course). It‚Äôs been a while since I paid attention to it, but the governing authorities did not have a passive ‚Äòlive and let live‚Äô attitude.They kept a FIRM proactive grip on ethnic tension. If the ruling Singaporean Chinese have abandoned that attitude and allowed themselves to become a minority in their own country, I expect you will find GAE fingerprints on the transformation project.

                    Note that the Asians, being race realists- that is, not having a Bible- do tend to keep a very firm and realistic grip on ethnic differences and hierarchy, even as those sub-ethnicities are readily acknowledged.
As examples, many dialects in China whether under Mongol or Han rule; the Khia, Viet, Montagnards in Vietnam; Khmer Rouge, Jeune, and Verde in Cambodia; Hmong in Laos. And of course, Malay in Malaysia.

Given that was 30 years ago now ‚Äì if the younger Han think they know better than Lee Kuan Yew and want to try the chaos of equality, they will be swamped in short order.  The Malays have their own nation with their own bumiputra; the Indians have Hindustani preferences in their own lands.

        However the political and territorial separation takes place, I‚Äôve always felt it will be necessary for the coastal leftist shitholes to continue their existence.  The only reasonable way to get the brown horde out of our hair will be to cut off all gibs to non-whites immediately and completely.  Having leftist enclaves as neighbors will provide Yadier, Pablo, and even Barkevious with an obvious solution to their sudden lack of funds.

                This is as old as when I was young.  In NYC and other major metro areas in what we now term Blue States, Blacks were moving from the rural South up North and collecting welfare immediately.  If I recall they were backed up by the Courts when States tried to establish residency requirements before eligibility for such welfare payments.

                The ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äù is an anti-Christian movement. At best current social ideals/assumptions are an outgrowth of the now dead Enlightenment principles.

        While I agree it would be near impossible to completely eliminate ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù getting rid of the vast majority of it would not be difficult.  Blacks are here to stay, there can be no getting rid of them. But most of the Central and South Americans would be fairly easy to get rid of.  They walked here. They have foreign identities and citizenship.   Walking back to Mexico or Venezuela just isn‚Äôt that difficult.The idea that these people will not leave if we got serious about their being here is a preposterous lie told by the ruling elite in order to defend the status quo.  It is absurd on its face.  Probably 1/2 of these people have gotten here in the last 20 years.  A very large fraction would leave if they were simply told to leave.  If the law was actually enforced, the vast majority would leave.  Make it a crime to rent or otherwise house them. Enforce the existing employment laws.Moving to a new country where the population doesn‚Äôt speak your language, where you culture is not dominant is a hardship.  But the hardship is overlooked by being much better off economically.  Take that economic benefit away and people will leave.There is a smallish number of Mexicans who have been here longer than most of us. They‚Äôre not going anywhere. But all these newcomers?  It would be fairly easy to get rid of the vast majority of them.  Don‚Äôt let the perfect be the enemy of imperfection.  Getting rid of 70% of them is better than the status quo.

            If Alvin Bragg, as a local county prosecutor, can enforce federal election laws, why can‚Äôt a local Texas prosecutor enforce federal immigration laws? Of course, federal judges will play it both ways and not allow this. But I can think of a lot of ways where local prosecutors can make examples of illegals, for example by charging them with local crimes and detaining them for years without trial. Perhaps enough to scare them into not coming, or even better going home.

                The problem is both parties support the status quo.  There needs to be a change in attitude among the elite.  The population mostly supports shutting down the border and repatriating a lot of these criminal invaders.  I think this is largely because the elite get the benefits and we pay the costs.

        I will add as I wait for approval, that there is a laboratory of peaceful separation. Its called Hollywood.Hollywood used to make all sorts of TV shows and movies. Believe it or not, dudes like Stephen J. Cannell used to make a good living out of male oriented TV shows. You might even have heard of one of them: the A-Team. TV used to be balanced out, half oriented towards women, half towards men. I did a fairly exhaustive analysis of the Fall premiere hours based on Wikipedia and stars, my own memories, and that of various family members who saw those shows to categorize them as male or female appealing. The gist of my research was that in the late 1970s to early mid 1980s, the balance in prime time hours tipped towards women, accelerating at a very rapid pace in the mid 1990s.Hollywood went female and proto-woke far before movies, in TV shows that per hour of output, far outstrips movie hours. Now Hollywood can‚Äôt even make an action movie without it being girl-bossery and stunning and brave. EVEN and ESPECIALLY when there is big time money at stake, they cannot and will not change course. Disney lost billions on Star Wars, and likely the same in Marvel. And all they can do is: the Acolyte, Agatha All Along (seriously that is the title of the streaming series), Echo (deaf/mute amputee Amerindian no not making this up), the Marvels, etc. Diverse Girl bosses all the way down.Hollywood just can‚Äôt crank out woke movies for the AWFLs (who don‚Äôt btw see them), and then various ‚ÄúWhitesploitation‚Äù movies like the original Iron Man or Die Hard or some other wisecracking White male underdog with flaws he overcomes. Its nothing but Girl Bossery all the time. Even when there is lots and lots of money to be made (Hollywood knows this, from Bob Iger to David Zaslav). Belief and ideology trump money. Pardon the pun.

        The diversity will demand to control weapons of mass destruction and delivery means. Do whites accede or reserve exclusive rights? What recourse for whites if foreigners are invited to occupy diverse territory with WMD? Control waterways, farmland and other resources? Nuke plants?
Peaceful separation could only work out well if the parties are, and they remain, reasonable. The diversity is not and it couldn‚Äôt sustain reasonableness. Not as its leadership envies the ascending white civilization.
Peaceful resolution isn‚Äôt a realistic prospect.

                ‚Ä¶The House passed the budget just after 2 a.m. Wednesday morning. Despite having the majority, Democrats still had to solve some infighting before they could pass the bill.

        ‚ÄúBecause whites will remain the largest population and will increase their self-segregation in response to their shrinking majority and the cultural assault on them from the elites, the racial tyranny must collapse.‚ÄùNot sure this conclusion invariably follows the premises in today‚Äôs missive.  Cultural‚Äîwhich is really what it‚Äôs all about for the typical White‚Äîassault continues and will continue as long as we live in the same country/society as the minorities that drive that cultural decline.  Separation entails not just living out of sight of non-Whites, but living in a community that reinforces White culture‚Äîand there is a ‚ÄòWhite‚Äù culture regardless of what academic charlatans would have us believe.  I grew up in one.Much of the history Z-man so aptly describes can be considered before modern media communications‚Äîand certainly all pre-internet. Take the Amish and their offshoots as an example of what ‚Äúliving apart‚Äù must entail today.  No radio, TV, Internet. No modern technology.  Self sufficiency and group interdependence.  A Christian heritage shared by those in the community.  That‚Äôs why they are who they are today.  They don‚Äôt have a ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù problem.Now perhaps Z-man was thinking at a higher/larger level of segregation, say at the level of a state or group of states.  This gets us back to something we‚Äôve discussed in the past‚Äîsecession.  That might work.

        The sorting underway proves your point. Throwing open the border has accelerated the process, and attempts to confine the vibrancy to areas without what is perceived as enough of it are all but impossible. ‚ÄúYou stay where the bus dropped you off!‚Äù the diverse migrant is berated. ‚ÄúYou stay where we dropped off the diverse migrant!‚Äù the white man is warned. Of course, diversity flows toward the urban setting with the most gibs, and whites congregate into increasingly segregated and removed redoubts. Everything old is new again.To bang my old hobby horse, the white Puritan who drives most of this madness is increasingly ignored and marginalized. They plot the next war for democracy, and eyes are rolled. They yell ‚Äúdiversity is our strength!‚Äù from their own all-white enclaves yet people vote with their feet. Maybe at some point they will put shock collars on the fantastic and holy individuals imported to their Colony Ridges and other garrisons among the whiteness, but those will be taken off. ‚ÄúStay put!‚Äù they will whimper as the diverse inevitably flow into their cities.The Puritan and his Tribal co-partner may try to go full Gaza against the subjugated majority/plurality, but success in doing so is not the way to bet because dysfunction has been the primary result of the Grand Plan. To borrow some of your optimism, worse may truly be better in that it forces the issue, and separation, dissolution and fragmentation accelerate in response. A severe economic downturn, which is coming, will remove any impediments that remain to this speeding up.‚ÄúReal proportionalism never has been tried,‚Äù they will shout at the clouds as it all comes tumbling down.

        Iirc, the frontier was officially declared closed in one of the late 19th century censuses. It was, of course, closing long before the authorities said so, which could‚Äôve been a cause of the Civil War. Without the pressure-release valve, somebody had to take over. Post-reconstruction, Yankeedom worked OK.Post-WWII, the frontier mentality made a fake and gay comeback, thanks to the automobile and radio/TV. Probably inflation, too. Not a true frontier thing, because travel and information kept people tethered. It‚Äôs probably not a coincidence that westerns were so popular then, or that rugged individualism is so popular with people of a certain age. Self-segregation seemed possible once more, but, again, it was fake and gay. What we got instead was a locust-like wave of consumption radiating from the cities like a bomb‚Äôs shockwave.I‚Äôve lived it. When I was a kid, it was Philadelphians. Then New Jerseyans, lately New Yorkers. Guess who follows, every single time. People might settle back down again if not constantly pushed. They might consume less and save instead of flipping this gig for the next. (That‚Äôs where inflation is important. If your house, for instance, wasn‚Äôt sitting there appreciating, you‚Äôd stay where you are‚Äîthe horror!‚Äî or go broke. And of course, every time you flip, everybody gets a piece of the action, taking back your gains, but not enough that you have to stop.)Fake and gay, fake and gay, but some people have made a lot of money on it. It does mirror what happened in frontier times, to an extent, with ‚Äòcivilization‚Äô chasing the asset-poor and dispossessed. Personally, I think it‚Äôs been no more than a rebranding of the American creation myth for cynical ends.Which goes to how it ends. In antebellum times, there were competing elites, and that competition escalated into civil war. I don‚Äôt see that happening now, because I don‚Äôt see competing elites. They aren‚Äôt that different. So I guess collapse, and my confidence is bolstered by the fact it‚Äôs a scam, at least as far as I can tell. That could mean balkanization, as regional elites rise up by necessity. Sounds a bit like federalism to me, so I‚Äôd be cool with it.

        I disagree Z-Man. Ask the Rohingya, or the Chinese in Indonesia, or the Tibetans, or the Uighurs, or Whites in South Africa, or the Parsees in Zanzibar (as Sailer never tires of pointing out, Freddy Mercury‚Äôs family had to flee there during the purges) about Option 1.It seems to work pretty well. Indeed the future of White people is most probably most being terminated with extreme prejudice, the rest fleeing.Wealthy and powerful people want this and they get their way.Per Sailer in TakiMag quoting Sheluyang Peng in American Affairs, Woke anti-White is the Post Christian love child of Puritanism and Quakerism. Thus the natural state of affairs for our leaders and AWFLs.Mega Corp wants a replacement for higher IQ slave labor in China and YOU are it YT.Mega immigration creates mega family re-unification which means YOUR stuff YT, where else will they live but your house, and how else will they be paid but out of YOUR bank account?Elites hate you and want you dead.The only way the Coalition of the Ascendant stays together is mutual hate hate hate of YT.Its as simple as that. If I had to guess there would be a combination of the mob (like the Soros generated one that burnt down the Israeli Embassy in Mexico City) and ‚Äújudges‚Äù like Meacham and Engeron that decide guilty! YT and take your stuff, stick you in Manzanar Plus for racial vengeance. It won‚Äôt stop at Trump and if they can do it to him they can do a lot more to you. My guess is the the Woke Leadership pursues the last few YT into the weeds right up until the Chinese and Russians land and take over. That is what happened essentially in Rwanda.Really, the AWFL leadership of Globohomo has an emotional NEED to get vengeance upon YT and the Alpha Chad who disappointed her. The real driver of all of this.

                The ‚ÄúCathedral‚Äù was coined by a Jew who liked to shift the blame entirely to Christianity for the decline. The Cathedral is the term for the bishop‚Äôs parish, a Catholic building. The evil ones were part of the cathedral, with the hyper individualism of Protestantism to blame.Not all Catholics are brown and most of Europe was Catholic until the 20th century, including France and half of Germany. The brown Catholics exist because the whites Catholics existed first.The philosophies behind Judaism and Protestantism are similar and produce similar cultures. The only meaningful push back in the Western world is the Catholic view point.Why a secular Boomer wants to get into all that and still avoid the Jews is a mystery.

        ‚ÄúPeaceful separation is the natural state of Americans‚Äù
That hasn‚Äôt been true since the 1950‚Äôs.
Generally when I see someone focused on peaceful separation, I see someone who doesn‚Äôt have the psychological makeup to free oneself from his chains.

                By what metric is it more segregated?
I find your claim impossible to believe.  In a 90% white country, by sheer chance alone, you would be more likely totally surrounded by white people.
I‚Äôm sure you could find some strange statistic that supports your claim if you ignore everything else.  I wasn‚Äôt around in the 1950s, but from my own lived experiences I‚Äôm sure as heck less segregated than I was in 1980.

                    Look at public schools, which are a great proxy. Tons of reports with lots of data. The public schools are as segregated now as in the 1960‚Äôs, despite massive efforts to integrate them. White people move away from diversity. The diversity tries to follow, but housing costs discriminate so the people do have to.

                        Here‚Äôs my observation from growing up in suburban Chicago.  As a kid I would go to the high school basketball games and later play,  and essentially all of the suburban teams in the Northwest/Western suburbs were completely white in the 70s, with the exception being the older cities like Aurora, Joliet and Elgin, which had poor sections of town. But generally it was suburbs white, half of Chicago black.In the 80‚Äôs that started to change, with blacks trickling in here and there.  In the 90s and 2000s there were quite a few more blacks on the basketball teams,  making it very different from the segregated 70‚Äôs.  Just my observation of one area.

                        Schools are a good example of a ‚Äútype‚Äù of segregation, but that‚Äôs because Whites‚Äîand others‚Äîhave been driven to private alternatives such as home schooling and charters.  This of course leaves minorities with the ‚Äúfree‚Äù or government alternative.  My city is a national example of exactly that.  We had the *last* school district in the nation under the *longest* court desegregation order‚Äî40+ years!It was finally removed/lifted (last I heard) after a successful challenge that there were *no* Whites left in the system to enable the court mandated desegregation.  üòâHousing and living arrangements might be another story.  There still seems to be quite an effort by HUD to spread the misery of integration around.  Magic dirt theory.  This State is going the CA way by passing law to allow subdividing property to build ‚Äúcasitas‚Äù next to the main structure.  In short, high density occupancy where there was once single residential zoning only.  Of course, the occupants will be of a lower SES, if not section 8.This falls in line your wonderful concept of ‚Äúmonetizing social capital‚Äù.  Here where I live, we have acreage, which falls into line with the high value of real estate you speak of that‚Äîin theory‚Äîpromotes segregation.  But‚Ä¶what happens when those casitas get built?I suspect I‚Äôll not see this happen because I‚Äôm old, but the children are already planning for this event.  They‚Äôll see it.

                        Look at public schools, which are a great proxy. Tons of reports with lots of data.As predicted, you are offering me a strange statistic that ignores the ‚Äúenriched‚Äù lives that all these children will experience in the workplace, at the store, public parks, and everything else.I would also suspect that the statistics look narrowly at the black/white divide and does not include all the Changs, Pejeets, and Gonzales that white children have to go to school with.  I‚Äôm sure the rate was near zero in 1950 outside of California or Southern Texas.Even if you are right about the schools, does it really matter when many of those ‚Äúsegregated‚Äù white children will never have children of their own because they will never be able to afford to buy into those good neighborhoods as the price keeps going up?Yup thats me,  I went to a nearly entirely white school in an upper-middle class town in the 1980s, but I never could afford to have a family myself.  I sometimes follow my white high school class on Facebook.  Approximately 50% of my classmates had children of their own, its quite staggering when you think about it.

Even the Lefties are making Z‚Äôs point.
the funny part is the whites who scream the loudest about racism live in lily white communities far from diversity.
Occasionally, they‚Äôll adopt some diversity.  Or maybe a couple people get through the gates and improve the school basketball team. And they‚Äôll pat themselves on the back about how tolerant they are.

        Im no fan of communism but it ‚Äúfailed‚Äù because the US signed absurd, losing trade deals with 90% of the world and provided free military favors with their promise to not trade with the USSR, and it still took forever. I agree Communism is as inhuman as birth control but they both can threaten to destroy nature

        This was really good. I have to applaud Z-Man for giving a succinct and accurate overview of the racial political problem in America that does not once mention the B-word. This proves that the Dissident Rightcangrow up and move beyond HBD, which is essential for it to get off the fringe and into the mainstream discussion. This is exactly what‚Äôs needed, and a lot more of it. I endorse every word. Coffee bought.

            Spoken as always without one example of where an understanding of HBD negatively affects the movement in any way.  Again, the challenge is made:  How is a scientific basis of Human Diversity a detriment to the DR?
I certainly can think of the counter example.  If HBD does not exist, then everyone is equal.  If everyone is equal, then separation of the people into enclaves of ‚Äúlikeness‚Äù is unjustifiable outside of human prejudice.  Which means basically, not much reason for the DR to exist or most of the discussion in the commentary.

                Not only does separation become unjustifiable, but enforced equality must also then be justified. Because what other explanation than racism could there be for disparity of results?

                    DLS, what you wrote is so stupid that it defies explanation.If you cannot think of anyotherpossibility besides HBD and ‚Äúracism‚Äù that would explain a disparity in social metrics between different racial groups, then you are pretty dim. Neither is it the case that ‚Äúforced equality‚Äù is justifiedeven ifracism existed. There is such a thing as freedom of association. People are free to include or exclude others from their societies, based on any reason or no reason, if that is the prudent thing to do.It seems like you‚Äôve absorbed a lot of Sailerite propaganda and you are retrojecting back upon yourself as a bugaboo. This is a pitiful effort to ‚Äúgoodthink‚Äù along with the dissidents. You really are not smart enough to play in this space, and I don‚Äôt want to see any more comments from you here ever again.

                        Intelligent Dasein, I think you missed my point, which is that most leftists believe racism is the cause of racial disparities and forced equality is the solution. Most on the dissident right understand this is what leftists believe. On a personal level, I assume you are not a leftist troll or a child. Therefore, I suspect you may be suffering from a borderline personality disorder. Your anger, name calling, and belief that you should have the power to control who speaks on an internet comment section are classic symptoms. I did not downvote you and I say this without trying to be sarcastic or mean. I know this is difficult to hear, but I feel like I have to point it out so that maybe if other people point it out as well, you will seek the help you need. I have a family member that has BPD, and I know it is very difficult to treat because your behavior seems perfectly normal to you when you feel threatened or powerless. But you can learn cues on how to respond when you feel triggered, so that you don‚Äôt alienate people in your life. Working with a good counselor is key. I wish you the best. Peace.

                There‚Äôs nothing wrong with HBD. There is an issue with HBD alone to try to explain everything. The question that highlights the weakness is as follows: ‚ÄúWould you send your kid to a bad school?‚Äù
