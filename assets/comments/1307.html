        The final goal of “race realism” seems unclear. I think if anything, it is a vehicle being used to reinstate freedom of association and freedom of speech. People are happy to live amongst those of other tribes, as long as they are able to say and do as they please without hurting others. Race realists have a recurring theme, that non-whites seem to be able to do and say as they please, while whites have to constantly self-edit what they want to say and end up living a lie to appease those whom they hate. Namely, self-righteous cowards waving the middle-management magic wand of political correctness. Which is no more than poor self-esteem manifested.The freedom of association and speech wont be coming any time soon. The easy solution is quick, brutal and very politically incorrect. That wont happen either any time soon.

        Good post – goes hand in hand with today’s Marginal Revolution post on ZMP. Let’s say there are millions of ZMP’s – what are you going to do about it?
