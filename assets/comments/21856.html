        The biggest fairy tale of all is the egalitarian argument. You‚Äôre seeing this equality nonsense fall apart as this election fraud comes into sharper focus. The biggest proponents of radical egalitarian policies are the ones perpetrating the voter fraud. And now the entire planet sees it. Interesting times.

            But they are radical, they truly believe that all races are equal. What is causing this inequality? White racism, or systemic racism. They are getting more and more radical and anti-white, because white people keep white people-ing and black people keep black people-ing. Nothing has ‚Äúfixed‚Äù it.
Although, given gen z‚Äôs obsession with rap music maybe they will close the gap by forcing whitey down to blacks‚Äô level.

                White people stand as a stark reminder of the foolishness of their equality of the races proposition.  Therefore, White people must be eliminated‚Äîeither through genocide or through social/economic sanctions.

                I‚Äôve been working on an essay that among other points, argues that White Supremacy and Systemic Racism are so evil and powerful that they even affect the Negroid race in times and places where there are few or no Whites! Surely this is the cause when Blacks take over a city or a country, and the place goes to shit, it somehow must be the White man‚Äôs fault. He took the magic with him.Based on what I‚Äôve read about sub-Saharan Africa, apparently the Caucasian race‚Äôs power was so malevolent that it kept the people in Africa living in paleolithic conditions even before the first European ever set foot there.

            This has been a year of verifying stereotypes. Starting with Jussie Smollett , the Jig Jew Jessie. The Jew plans a racial hatred crime against Whites,the black screws it up and the shirt-lifter adds all the nice bits of artistic adornment.

            Election fraud has always been a problem of course. What is new ‚Äî to me ‚Äî is this is the first time in my living memory (I‚Äôm late 50s) at least, that one side is vehemently challenging the counts. Like most of us here, I wish Trump the best. Even in the likley case he fails, he has still done a great service in highlighting the skullduggery of the other side. He has nothing to lose. Of course, the Liberals just call him a spoilsport, who would not accept the will of the people or some such rubbish. Yet another instance of NewThink pushing Reality off the stage. The elections were fair because we say they were!

        This post makes me suspect that Z is obese. Is he coping?

Diet matters. Working out is important. Sure you can live to 80 on a medication cocktail and in a wheelchair as a fat person.

Eat what your ancestors ate ‚Äì as a white man that‚Äôs eggs, meat, potatoes, milk, fish. Stay away from PUFA and anything processed, and also put as little money as you can into the system (eat at home).

            Yep
I thank my parents for exposing me to Italy at a young age and how to eat properly and intelligently
They have eating down to a science and it‚Äôs all so effortless and cultured
America tried that in recent years, and at times has succeeded, but oftentimes it‚Äôs a poor facsimile of the European model

                    The tomatoes are to die for, and the cheeses, dairy, etc
One thing I like about over there is they don‚Äôt pasteurize their creams and juices ‚Äî at least where I get my food from local markets right off the farms,  but the supermarkets may pasteurize their products. Flavor is maybe 2x to 3x better. Just have to eat it before it spoils.

Thanks for evoking good memories. If this virus fakery ever lifts, we are going back there asap. Rent a convertIble and drive to Ventimilia, sampling the little towns and their smells along the way.

        my grandfather used to tell us that doctors were the new priests and would eventually go overboard harping on one‚Äôs good health.  I took it to mean that because the body is one‚Äôs temple that keeping it healthy was being a good Christian ‚Äî thereby tying medicine and religion into a similar human enterprise.
Notice how doctors today frown on you like a priest if you confess to having a few extra drinks.
He also said in every town there is only one good doctor.
Wise old doctor he was.

            Notice how doctors today frown on you like a priest if you confess to having a few extra drinks.Indeed. The moral judgement comes thick and fast. A recent visit to the doctor for my wife, who had a bruise, led to the doctor (female rag head) initiating the following brief exchange:Doctor Rag Head:I have to ask, about the bruise‚Ä¶ Does your husband abuse you?Wife:Only verbally.Apparently, the doctor did not get this joke; rather, she looked at my wife in a concerned manner.I told her later that this woman should not be joked with ‚Äì they take these things seriously. In addition she is not ‚Äòone of us‚Äô.

                    I‚Äôve can‚Äôt remember if I‚Äôve ever had to fill out one of those, but suffice it to say that if you admit to depression or suicidal thoughts on those forms, you‚Äôre a moron. Suicidal thoughts, in particular, are grounds for involuntary mental health confinement and evaluation.

                        Yeah, here in FL I‚Äôve seen that first-hand a couple times. What blows me away is that they keep the person for a maximum of three days. As if that is going to magically alleviate a true suicidal or other unhinged person.

                I believe they are required to ask about abuse.  I had a health scare that took me to the emergency room a few years ago.  I was having heat exhaustion that felt like a heart attack.  I recall the doctor asking me if my wife was abusive.  I was completely puzzled about what that had to do with my symptoms.

                Don‚Äôt lay all the blame on the MD‚Äôs. Very likely they are required by law to ask those types of questions. I knew a woman (mid-50s) who was dopey on pills, slipped, fell and hit her eye against a table leg in a room full of witnesses. Fortunately, she wasn‚Äôt seriously harmed. She did get a black eye. Even so, she later said the police came to her home asking if there had been a domestic abuse incident. She was divorced and lived alone. And this, in arelativelysane part of the country.

            That‚Äôs why commies colonize the Medical Industrial Complex early and often. Not so much trauma care where it‚Äôs obvious whether you know what you‚Äôre doing or not but damn near everywhere else.

            That has to do with the corporatization and financialization of medicine. The local independent doctor with an office attached to his/her home was denied admitting privileges and insurance compensation unless he joined a ‚Äúnetwork.‚Äù  This was sold as a way to ‚Äúkeep costs and prices down.‚Äù Of course the opposite happened. You can‚Äôt even go to the ER anymore w/o prior network approval and premiums outpace inflation by a factor every enrollment period.

        Trog angered the gods is more easily accepted than Trog was eaten by a bear, because that‚Äôs what bears do.
True, but the stories that lasted from the past were stories that provided a lesson that actually helped people avoid danger. German fairy tales are remarkably dark, but they did keep kids from doing things that could get them into trouble.
Our current fairy tales won‚Äôt last because they make life worse for those who believe them.

                Then there is the opposite: those of us who knew that our fathers were wastes, and yet here and there were glimmers of humanity. Both of my parents were addicted to crack. Mom did a complete 180; dad eventually died.The only good thing he did for himself was work out. A bodybuilder, in fact. I saw him shortly before he died, after a seven-year hiatus in our relationship. We went to our old crabbing dock and I untied the traps and threw one far out into the fog. Behind me, I hear ‚ÄúWow, son. You don‚Äôt throw like a girl anymore!‚Äù I could hear that he was smiling.I turn over that memory pretty often.

                A good going over of our views will cure us of any notion that we don‚Äôt hold any silly beliefs ourselves.We live in a world absolutely saturated in lies and distortions spread by some evil people, but also by very good people who do not know they are lies.I was having back trouble some years ago and I cannot tell you how many people who I interacted with in various capacities swore about the efficacy of magnet bracelets, chiropractors and other wacky so-called treatments.  Probably all of them meant well.

The other point was it‚Äôs not just politics and race and the stuff we are interested in. It is everything.

                My father was wise. I miss being able to talk to him. We didn‚Äôt agree on everything, but he was always worth listening to. He was born in 1917, so his teen and young adult years were during the Great Depression, then he fought in World War 2. He was a product of privation and peril no American today can imagine ‚Äî even my son with 5 combat deployments didn‚Äôt see the volume of slaughter my Dad endured ‚Äî North Africa, Anzio, Monte Casino, the Po Valley and points in between ‚Äî though my son did see a good bit.Seeing your friends blown up, picking pieces of them up off the road, that will teach you about what‚Äôs real and important right quick.

                    As difficult as life was for our parents and grandparents, etc. they had the benefit of knowing there was a family and close knit community that loved them no matter.
The power that family and community give one to persevere in life is something we have all lost and need to get back. Pronto.
Strange but when I go back home and am around my family, I feel close to invincible. The atomization of modern life is weakening us immensely.

            Given the history of the news industry, it is amazing they were able to convince so many of people they were objective truth tellers.  In America, the news industry has been propaganda since the days of the Colonial pamphleteers.  One of my favorite examples is from David McCullough‚Äôs book on the Wright Brothers.  After their first successful flight they sent a short telegram to their family in Dayton so they could put a notice in the local newspaper of their success.  The telegram operator asked if he could inform a friend was a reporter at the Norfolk Pilot-Union.  The Wright Brothers said no, but he gave the reporter a copy of the telegram anyway.  The reporter took a short telegram and turned into a huge story full of information he simply made up about both the Wright Brothers and their flight.  Here is their correction 100 years later where they call the fabrications ‚Äúa few errors.‚Äù This is truly an industry without ethics.https://www.pilotonline.com/history/article_610fe57e-e3f0-5048-a7c3-4a45983a5822.html

                There is a theory that the push toward universal literacy was actually a ploy to make sure everybody fell under the sway of the media.

                    I just read about that from Mortimer Adler‚Äôs How to Read a Book (great book, btw). He said exactly that. That those who can only read at an elementary level, are VERY susceptible to propaganda.

                    I beg to differ. I like Mark Twain‚Äôs comment: ‚ÄúThe man who does not read books, has no advantage over the man who cannot read books.‚Äù Perhaps it is relevant that he said ‚Äúbooks,‚Äù not ‚Äúnewspapers.‚Äù And this advice, from a man known for his tall tales.

        Z‚Äôs essays are always thought provoking, but as regards to food, I think he‚Äôs plainly wrong. Humans are for sure omnivores and can survive on diets ranging from just meat (and blubber) to a purely vegetarian diet. However, in evolutionary terms, we especially relish protein because we used to have to run pretty fast to catch (or to avoid) it‚Äîand sweets came only at the price of painful stings. The abundance of such foods today can be seen in the prevalence of the diseases afflicting modern man (as opposed to the diseases of malnutrition that our ancestors endured). He may factor out drugs and alcohol, but these are actually manifestations of the same thing. Pleasure-giving chemicals we used to receive in micro-doses as ‚Äúrewards‚Äù are now available for a price. Indeed, his is an argument of extreme egalitarianism not unlike that of our rulers who claim that we humans are all interchangeable: an East African can simply be swapped out for a Scandinavian, and if you net out the loss of social cohesion, soaring crime rate and burned-out buildings, Minneapolis is still totally fine (just with better food).

            my daughter‚Äôs boyfriend is a vegan
He‚Äôs great young man and is into it b/c his mother died rather young and he‚Äôs hoping to not have a similar situation and is a believer in diet.  Fine by me.
But he has ZERO energy.  In terms of doing anything physical like even sweeping the floor.  Yes, he can type on the computer all day.
I have noticed that red meat gives a man that boost and that power to do physical tasks and so forth.  No wonder those Mexican field hands eat the burritos and work all day.

            Yes. Zman is almost always right. But not on diet.Diet is everything. I say this from direct experience, not from theory or opinion. In fact, I denied the diet connection for most of my life until I fixed my diet which made it impossible for me to deny it.I‚Äôm only posting here becauseI want Zman to live a lot longer and more productively. I‚Äôm about Zman‚Äôs age and have getting healthier as I age merely from dietary changes (80% of health is diet in our age of processed food). I‚Äôve a washboard stomach and the health metrics of a 25 year old and I never go to the doctor‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs 80% diet and 20% lifting weights/living active. That‚Äôs it. At this pace I‚Äôll live productively past 100 yo.

                The mistake you make is assuming your ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù diet is everyone‚Äôs correct diet.  If you feel better eating as you do, fine.  However that probably is not the same for others‚Äîand if not, ‚Äúdiet‚Äù as you discuss will have to be much more strenuously defined.  This conversation has been going on for decades and it seems every few years another diet book hits the stand and makes a scene, then dies out.  Why?  I suspect it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt really work for all, but a few specific persons.I‚Äôll admit to being quite jaded on the matter.  Forty+ years of marriage to a person with body dysphoria will do that to you.  I‚Äôve suffered through every new trend that came along‚Äîand still do, although now we are moving into plastic surgery.  üôÅ

        I found that diet does have a significant effect, just not the way the experts claim. Eating more fats and meats helps me avoid sweets and snacking. Also less sweets keeps me from breaking out in horrible acne. It is almost as if the sweets and carbs increase my appetite. It‚Äôs a vicious circle.The epidemic of acne among teenagers could probably be mitigated by a lot if they would stop drinking soda and ate more of the fattier cuts of meat.Of course now our satanic elites want us eating bug paste. I think most of the nutrition advice is simply due to their hatred of us. Whole milk and high fat yogurt is just so much more delicious than the low fat high carb shit they insist on us eating.I‚Äôd also like to find a good source of real lard, not that shelf stable hydrogenated crap they keep pushing in the grocery stores.

                This is nothing new. I think Atkin‚Äôs book was from the early 70s. I read his first one. He called it ‚Äúinsulin resistance.‚Äù In the 1980s there was a similar book by a Newbold. Avoid sugars. Avoid refined carbs. Eat like a caveman: unprocessed meats, fresh vegetables, fruits. Atkins was very anti-carb, even natural fruits, but these authors seem to have had quite the wise advice.

        I can‚Äôt remember exactly the subject but Joe Sobran writing about how embarrassingly long it took him to shake some belief in a system. We are indoctrinated formally and informally on many things with little chance to ponder the truth of something. Easier to just go along or repeat, usually unknowingly.
This current madness we are going through exposes much of that with the people I know well. Many are not stupid but their behavior shows otherwise. Best I can do is constantly check my own premises.

            There was a show in the 80‚Äôs, an Outer Limits episode I think, with (Drew Barrymore?) a little girl threatened with asphyxiation in her sleep by an evil gnome under her bed.  The family cat fought a monumental battle and overcame the little breath stealer.

        Of course another good example is joggers.  Up until 60-70 years ago, everyone knew the score and acted/treated them accordingly.  Now, after 55 years of age incessant brainwashing that they‚Äôre just like us, bleed red blah, blah, blah, here we are.  Joggers slaughtering each other and everyone else on a daily basis and the vast majority ignoring it or willfully turning a blind eye.  Of course the main slimes media also willfully refuses to report on it.  The purveyors of these lies hopefully will have much to answer for.

            That‚Äôs the greatest part of the lie: Joe Average feels so free with his democracy he doesn‚Äôt believe that there is anything bad about it. He may even tacitly agree that he is not truly free, but when you start talking to these people about what the ‚Äòelites‚Äô are up to, well then ‚ÄòSurely! They wouldn‚Äôt do that! You‚Äôre being silly!‚Äô.The NPC mentality was once again brought home to me I think yesterday or the day before. A commenter here posted a video of two men resisting supermarket security in Bristol, UK. With the exception of the two legendary whites, dusky mask enforcers (I assume that is the reason for the beef) and the cameraman, most just go about their business ‚Äì completely ignoring the event.

        People want (well, maybe not us realists) so badly to believe all humans, all races are the same.  They see that cool, smart black guy on TV, or the guy they work with, or the smart GOP politician, and tend to project that guy on all black people.  It makes them believe they can all be like that guy if only‚Ä¶(fill in remedial social program or anti-racist behavior by whites here) The huge, obvious differences like the sky-high crime rates, the no-go zones, the domination in certain sports, the abysmal school performances, and all around dysfunction are ignored or downplayed by their belief in themselves as a good person who believes in the highest ideal, which is all people are equal.

        Nutrition and diet is one of the areas that it‚Äôs most apparent the current consensus is based almost completely on inertia and not any sort of dispassionate analysis.The most laughable example is BMI measurement for reasons that should not have to be explained.The second most is the ‚Äòcarbs are good‚Äô bandwagon. Truth is, the reason why atkins works is because you don‚Äôt spike your sugars, which makes you want to eat less, which makes you lose weight. I‚Äôve had friends who went to atkins and then did a seven day fast like it was nothing. One lost 100 pounds in a year.There‚Äôs really no excuse anymore except that either our medical profession is incredibly lazy or there is an implicit goal of making us all weak and sick.Another field is fitness, where the industry still hasn‚Äôt wrapped their heads around the fact that exercise is ineffective for weight loss. What is can do is make you stronger and more useful through a basic barbell routine. That would only require a couple of hours of personal training and gyms would actually have to have decent equipment, so that‚Äôs a no-go though. There‚Äôs also the psychological edge that a confident, powerful man tends to be a right-wing man.

        Awareness of reality matters, but you must practice in order to get good at it. On the topic of the obesity epidemic, go to a McDonalds (or the grocery store if you prefer) and make an assessment based upon your own visual data input. Do this with a simply count by category (trim/fit, hefty, and fat). Don‚Äôt forget to include young children. The results with shock you.

            The obesity epidemic is another exaggeration. Yeah, people are fatter, but when you net out death from despair (drugs, alcohol, suicide) life expectancy has not changed.

                True, but what would life expectancy be is people were as thin as they were in 1920s? Also, would their lives be better, i.e. less joint pain, etc.
But the deaths from despair for Whites, which, of course, is completely ignored by TPTB, is a far more important issue. White men are acting more and more like Native Americans (though we lack their almost complete vulnerability to alcoholism, Irish excepted), which is what happens to a defeated people.

                    We can‚Äôt know that, but we do know that as people have grown fatter, we have not seen life expectancy decline. Medicine has also improved along with the food supply. We have lower amounts of interpersonal violence. In the 1920‚Äôs, highway bandits were still a real thing. The fact is, within the extremes of malnutrition and morbid obesity, diet is a trivial matter physiologically. It is, however, a paramount issue morally. It‚Äôs why religions have dietary laws.

                        There are very many fat old people who you would think would be dead. I mean 75 plus age. Modern medicine keeps them going but a bunch of obese related maladies hound them and keep them on scripts. Quality of life suffers indeed.
Do you ever just look at historical bios on past generations and even actors on IMDB. So many died of heart attacks, strokes and the like at an early age and mostly all of them were thin. I‚Äôm sure smoking helps that for sure.

                                More so in post 65 but we age groups as we know are so. What was it that  I heard, the average woman weighs more than the average man from 1965. Exaggeration maybe but not by much.

                                    I‚Äôve watched any number of Army training videos from the early 60‚Äôs and the Viet Nam era.  Even though we are seeing 18 to 20 somethings in action, these guys look like they are from another planet‚Äîbone thin, lanky, etc.  they don‚Äôt look like any grouping of American soldiers I see today.  Perhaps today we live longer, but it‚Äôs hard for me to believe we live as well given our current food choices/recommendations.

                                        It‚Äôs not just diet/food choices, but all the chemical additives.

                            That is my experience as well.  I can tell after I eat something whether it was good for me based on how I feel.  Too many carbs and I get spacey and sleepy, but not enough and I get fidgety.  A large breakfast with eggs and lean meat start the day solidly.Mixed nuts and pistachios mid-afternoon give me a nice energy boost and my curb appetite. I try to have one big meal for lunch or dinner, and one smaller lean one.  It‚Äôs all about balance and being mindful of how foods make you feel.  I think Zman is right that you can tune all the other crap out, to which I would include cholesterol.  But I do believe sugar can‚Äôt be good for you because it is empty calories.  An average man burns about 2500 calories a day.  Stay under that and you will maintain or lose weight.

                            Actually, if you are eating unprocessed meats and fresh fruits and vegetables, you are probably 95% of the way to the best diet humanly possible. I‚Äôve never heard credible claims that highly refined carbs (flour, etc), sugar in its various forms, and chemical additives are good for us, especially in the quantities the average person consumes them. In fact, some doctors (Atkins, etc.) point out that much of what humans eat now wasn‚Äôt even an option pre-civilization (cereal grains, domesticated animals). Ten thousand years sounds like a long time, but it‚Äôs nothing by evolution‚Äôs standards. Of course natural selection is still culling, but it doesn‚Äôt work that fast. Consider that a sizeable portion of humanity even today cannot digest cow‚Äôs milk, because they lack an enzyme.If these authorities are correct, then humans shouldn‚Äôt eat cereal grains in the amounts they do. On their side is hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution.An all-meat diet is ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù in terms of resource usage, which is one reason so many of the save-the-Earth types oppose it, and prefer you would grains and tofu.That said, I like my white breads, my sugary snacks and so forth. But they shouldn‚Äôt be the majority of one‚Äôs diet.

                                Long life  is mostly genetic as is resistance the world killing you for all kinds of dumb things you did out of stupidity or necessity.For those with less resistance , a healthy diet reduces the need for medicine or surgery  later on.Since no matter what people tell you we don‚Äôt yet understand how the body works enough to custom tailor nutritional regimens understand we live in a profoundly unnatural circumstances for our species take a good multivitamin for most plenty of Vitamin D as well eat the healthiest food you can and that is all you can do.

                        food brings both pleasure and nourishment, so of course it‚Äôs a moral issue. feed the starving. don‚Äôt be a glutton. have some discipline and don‚Äôt eat meat Fridays for our Lord. and so on.that said, both extremes can be too populated at times, either in the older malthusian famine days, or the postmodern empty gluttony days. the latter may live longer, but quality of life doesn‚Äôt follow along always‚Ä¶ white deaths of despair do include the obese white hinterland fatsos as well as mostly white anorexic girls. the ones in the middle are also affected though, as the schizo culture tells them it‚Äôs okay to be fat and glutton but also that they should have a gym-to-instagram lifestyle. hamsters gotta spin those wheels, you know.if there‚Äôs one diet truth, is that vegetarians and vegans are hormonally imbalanced and thus all turn into commie poz. Adolph shouldn‚Äôt have tried it out after Geli died, it messed him up. thus he went too far after Chamberlain and Munich.

                    My daughter does a lot of surgeries ‚Äî limb amputations ‚Äî on obese diabetics who let their diabetes get out of control. She hates those surgeries, because it‚Äôs literally chopping off dead parts one at a time until the person finally dies. The only reason this happens is because the diabetic does not do what it takes to control their blood sugar and this has to do with diet and lifestyle as well as medicine. You almost never see skinny diabetics needing limbs cut off.

                    I don‚Äôt think the Irish are more prone to alcoholism than anyone else at least on a genetic level since most of them are heavily Scandinavian in ethnic makeup, not Celt .Its the culture for which you can in part blame the Catholic Church. And note too alcohol  use in Ireland is way down among Whites. My guess is they are using X instead.Now as to despair, its not just us. Its every group with an IQ above 90  or so who isn‚Äôt extremely religious is at most replacement.Modernity and Consumerism sterilize mankind.  That means everywhere even Brazil and MexicoThis suggests to me that we have a species wide social carrying capacity and  that once our numbers get to large, we stop having babiesAfter that the population falls and the material conditions of the purposeless Mouse Utopia we live in and is killing us come to end.We go back to more biologically  suited ways of living albeit more difficult ones  and stabilize at some much  lower number.I don‚Äôt think there is anything that can be done. Every single government effort has failed and even pimping religion and ‚Äútraditional values‚Äù never seems t have any lasting effect.Near complete hermitage ala North Korea gets you 1.94 under replacement and only a shade more than Sweden!Only thing that might work is to get the stupid out of government so that say the new system doesn‚Äôt commit civic suicide over a slightly dangerous flu.Maybe, maybe a DR state can get the population up a bit. It will take some headspace changes so that measures like bringing back difficult divorce for people with kids aren‚Äôt thought of as ‚Äúdraconian.‚ÄùIf we can shake off the Leftist spell than maybe.Even so its just that, maybe. 2.1 TFR may be flat out impossible.

                What would it be with the current obesity rate, minus modern pills and chemicals and surgeries? Lots of people spend 10 years on the brink as medical zombies until their obesity finally kills them.
But absolutely, alcohol and opioids are our worst killer. The scale of the opioid crisis is staggering and nothing has been done. Also, casual alcoholism is quite common. People just brush it off as funny or a few drinks but they are addicts. At least whitey can handle alcohol a bit better.

                My comment was directed at learning to become reality aware, and the obesity experiment is an easy opportunity. But you can substitute other criteria if you prefer. For example, learning to ‚Äútrack‚Äù is simply a matter of observing people in motion on soft ground and then carefully examining their footprints as you follow behind them. You will soon learn that you can quickly approximate size and weight from the shape and indentation of the print, and also correlate other behaviors with orientation and spacing.

                    We tracked IA‚Äôs in the desert here for about 3 yr‚Äôs.  Great fun‚Äîuntil they figured it out.  Now they manufacture ‚Äúbooties‚Äù from carpet scraps and heavy felt.  The prints they leave are pretty undetectable and ground disturbances blow over quickly.  Once they leave the washes, they are undetectable.

                        O/T One Reaper with a infrared camera can track illegals in real-time over an area of in excess of 300 square miles. In wartime, this can be used to fix fire coordinates with devastating accuracy. Or alternately, could enable near immediate interdiction by Border Patrol if authorized. But learning to track is primarily about teaching your brain to focus on reality with a purpose. That‚Äôs a skill that may come in handy in a few months.

Just be active.  I think too much time in the gym is counterproductive.  Plus better to be outside when exercising

                                    I bought a small farm a while back. I decided to plant an orchard because, hey, you plant it and forget it!
uh huh
buying the trees;digging holes;setting a deer fence;planting;watering;pruning-a lot of pruning!mulching;you get the idea.
There is no such thing as a laid back farmer, especially if you want to sell or be self sustaining.
next are chickens and goats.
If you can, do it. It is very rewarding.

                        If none of these work, or even if they do, try this:  The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Clair Davies.  It is the best investment I have ever made.  I bought a 120 acre farm at age 54 and spent plenty of time riving t-posts, digging holes for trees and fence posts, irrigation trenches, etc, etc.  This book shows how to deal with injuries to muscles and soft tissue that often manifest as joint injuries in a way that you can treat yourself.  Saved me thousands in physical therapy and kept me on the job.

                    Too much working out makes Jack a dull boyJust exercise outside playing sports and do yard work and chores.  Swim as much as possible.  Play hoops at the park.  Throw a football.  Hit tennis balls.  Too much time in the gym is not good for a person and gives you muscle where you really don‚Äôt need it and isolates muscle groups that should be working in unison.  I have yet to meet a buffed up gym rat who can pick up and move a piece of furniture or last 30 minutes doing gardening or anything resembling farming.  It‚Äôs almost like ornamental strength.And have you seen older people who worked out with weights when younger?  The are disgusting looking with flab and tits bigger than most women.  Check out Arnold Schwarzenegger lately.  His disgusting upper body should scare the bejesus out of anyone.

                excessive working out will do permanent wear on your body.  people can get compulsive about anything, but exercise can produce a genuine euphoric high feeling, so that draws in the dopamine seekers.
it‚Äôs good practice to have a goal in mind, and then make a training plan to achieve that goal.  and not just camp out a Planet Fitness for 2 hours every evening after work‚Ä¶

                        Muscle cells are muscle cells. Fat cells are fat cells. They don‚Äôt swap out.  Fun fact: you will never have more muscle cells than you were born with. You can make them bigger, but you can‚Äôt make more of them.  Not like bone or skin cells replenishing.

                I neither agree nor disagree, but I will note that in my younger days I‚Äôd exercise and be sore a little bit the next day and then would be able to dodge being sore at all if I had to do anything strenuous (a ton of yard work for example).  As I got older that got to be less and less the case and soon I was starting to not be sore as I went to the gym to be sore again.  I figured that it was probably making me more miserable than I cared to be: sure without exercise I‚Äôd now be sore after doing yard work, but I also would now not be sore the rest of the week.

                    Problem as I see it is basically, ‚ÄúUse it or lose it!‚Äù  Sore is the price you pay for keeping your strength, balance, and flexibility.  Doesn‚Äôt need to be excessively strenuous, but sitting around does not produce positive benefits at advanced age.

                        Living the Truth and strength are both achieved through embracing discomfort.First step is to orient the mind toward that discomfort.Without first converting the habitual aversion to discomfort into a habitual need to seek discomfort, the rest is just debating the style of roofline on a house built on sand. Pretty lies lurk.When you seek strength you will come to know what type of fuel beat serves this.Individuation matters. Know thyself.I like to nerd out on nutrition and physiology but this notion is the one I return to when the noise in the system gets cranked up.Also: walk before run, form before mass, precision before speed, function before fight. And my body is a hot mess. If I can do it‚Ä¶

                            I always found weightlifting awkward, painful, and not very productive. Then I had a personal trainer for a roommate and he showed me a powerlifting book that went over the body‚Äôs mechanics and how strength is generated.
It was a revelation that had me loving the weight room. Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe. Highly recommended.

                    Yeah I get where yo are coming from
All I am trying to do is impress upon younger guys that working out with weights can be harmful long term, and those muscles turn to hideous flab and man boobs.
Better to exercise, outdoors preferably, and do things where all muscles and so forth work together rather than isolating muscle groups for purely aesthetic results.

                        Just stop.Its fine if you don‚Äôt lift but stop trying to bend the truth around your preferences (and grossly misinformed opinions and assumptions).Some roided up body-builder turned actor is not representative of weight training as a practice. Muscle doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúturn to hideous flab‚Äù. You have it reversed.Well rounded activity is great. Outdoor activity is great.Resistance training within the confines of proper form, periods of rest, and nutrition is one of the most beneficial physical activities a man can do for overall wellness.If only we had the problem of men wearing themselves out from lifting. Sheesh. 25% of army recruits are too fat or too weak to make the cut. And the bar is low already.Speaking of. How low must T levels go before its okay to tell our boys to pick up heavy objects again? Or is the goal mulatto grandkids and well-behaved grandpets?

        We learn by stories, and all stories are, at their heart, a morality tale. Good vs evil. Protagonist vs antagonist.
With food, it‚Äôs a tale of you (the protagonist) vs a bad diet or carbs or gluten (antagonist). They are trying to destroy you so you must overcome them.
With Progressives, it‚Äôs a tale of them vs evil White racists.
We must always remember to couch our arguments as stories placing the person that we are trying to convince in the role of the hero overcoming an evil antagonist. It‚Äôs how they learn and how they come to our side.

            (((Carbs)))?I think gluten gets a bad rap. Gluten is the whyte supremes of modern food.&lt;1% of people explode from the greatest threat to our GI‚Äôs. But suddenly everybody is ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù and scouring the ingredients for clues of gluten supremacy and now bread and pasta must be made out of rice and garbanzos (‚Äúgood carbs‚Äù) or some kid will blast his pants on the way to indoctrination camp.Meanwhile the real problem is not some protein found among many, the one that also happens to give bread all its structure and enjoyable texture, but its the fact that diet is still 90% processed carbohydrates (sugar) and fat (veg oil) because parental units are too busy to buy broccoli and chicken.Half-joking aside, good point: our side needs to constantly improve our own storytelling. Both to our own and those trapped in the dmz.

                I‚Äôve heard the gluten problem is from modern grains bred for maximum efficiency, or additives destroying the GI/gut biome. Both sound plausible.
In any case additives sound like a bad idea to me, and I prefer cultivars from the preindustrial food supply. More like how nature intended.

                        The idea is that the wheat is different today and that might be what‚Äôs causing the sensitivity. Different composition, different compounds or whatever‚Äî enough to throw off the biochemistry. No idea if it‚Äôs the cause, but it seems plausible, especially considering how unnatural a lot of these plants are nowadays.

                        Exactly. Also, factor bread doesn‚Äôt use sourdough to ferment. Sourdough helps break down the gluten, in essence doing some of the digestion for you.
This is especially true of ‚Äúno-knead‚Äù sourdough bread where you have very long fermentation. People with digestive distress from bread should try sourdough breads. It may help. (It also might not help, btw.)

                    Modern factory bread has a lot more gluten than in the past due to changes in the wheat. In addition, they don‚Äôt use sourdough yeast, which helps in the digestion of gluten.
Basically, even if you were eating the same amount of bread as someone in 1930, you‚Äôd be eating lot more gluten and it would be harder to digest. For some people, that‚Äôs an issue; for others, it‚Äôs not. But our bodies are having to deal with more gluten.

                        Very interesting. I wonder why they‚Äôd change the yeast.  Another victim of efficiency?
Also: does sourdough involve bacteria?

                            Whoops. Hold up on the increased gluten in modern wheat. My medical researcher says it may be more complicated than that. It might be the kind of gluten.
Regardless, two definite issues are not using sourdough for fermentation and all crops lacking the micro-nutrients because they‚Äôve been leeched from the soil.
Your body is not getting a lot of the help that it once got to digest your bread (and other food). Again, bothers some people but not others.

                            Learn to make your own yeast bread. No-knead takes five minutes for really excellent bread. A six quart or larger cast iron pot with a tight-fitting lid is the perfect bread oven ‚Äî you can buy Lodge for less than twenty bucks. Buy organic grains and flours from Bob‚Äôs Red Mill or King Arthur. So easy for such a great reward.

                                Yep. I used use the Lodge cast iron combo cooker. Drop the dough on the heated skillet portion and put the heated pot on top. Much easier than trying to drop into a single pot.
Also, might I suggest cranberry pecan sourdough. Best toast you‚Äôll ever have.

                            ok, when i was a kid (60‚Äôs) bread would go stale in a couple of days.   now, it kind of never goes stale, it just gets moldy.  so something is very different in the process.

                    Modern tech has given us genetically modified foodstuffs, built-in pesticides and so forth. Who knows what the long-term effects are? But gather round boys and girls, here‚Äôs a food tale from the days before it took a chemical engineer to bake bread!Did you ever wonder what the ‚Äúenriched‚Äù in enriched white flour was? Several centuries back, white flour and the bread it made was a luxury. As technology improved, white flour became affordable. It was quickly discoverd, alas, that the peasants, who had previously survived on brown bread, tended to starve if they ate the white bread.So they learned to add back enough ingredients to reduce that problem. Sometimes additives are agoodthing!Yet, as the post below notes, two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. What is legally called ‚Äúwhole wheat‚Äù is anything but.

                        I never got that. All these nutrients get stripped during production, then they add chemicals to replace the nutrients. It seems silly and probably not as healthy, but I guess they can produce more and cheaper food that way. Gotta keep the workers fed so they can keep working!

The fact that such a degraded food was seen as a luxury at one time is just stupid imo.

            That is much easier said than done for people such as myself who at least try to draw conclusions based on evidence or reason. For instance I have one friend to whom I can talk about forbidden topics without getting screamed at. Yesterday I tried (for probably the 10th time) to explain why I know The Rona to be a scam. I said I know I have moles in the yard because I can see their hills. I know it‚Äôs been raining heavily because the river is over the bank, etc. I know there‚Äôs no pandemic because I don‚Äôt know one person who has died of it. And I personally know, by extension, thousands.She remains unconvinced because the known pathological liars on tv are telling a different story. How would you frame this situation as a story rather than observation and evidence to encourage a change in perspective?

                She remains unconvinced because the known pathological liars on tv are telling a different story.
Whether they were lying or just wrong, everything we were told early on about corona was wildly, laughably inaccurate. People were going to be left to die in the hallways of hospitals. The crematoria and morgues weren‚Äôt going to be able to keep up with the bodies. In any sane society, the media, the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, etc. would be laughingstocks and angry mobs armed with pitchforks and torches would be hunting them down. Yet, most people still listen to these clowns.

                        They‚Äôre still pushing that.  Yesterday I ventured out to some stores for the first time in 6 months, in search of a few table lamps.  Every location now has a greeter, like Walmart ‚Äì a woman telling me that she has carts that have been freshly disinfected.  I‚Äôve blown past the Walmart mystery-meat greeters for years, and I did the same to these idiot White women.  Boy does it irritate them.  I‚Äôve had managers reproach me and ban me because I won‚Äôt talk with greeters.

                How would you frame this situation as a story rather than observation and evidence to encourage a change in perspective?You can‚Äôt. Just as you can‚Äôt grow crops in the desert ‚Äì at least without irrigation. She‚Äôs getting hit with hours and hours of stories from the other side every day. Hard to break through with some people. Focus your energy on those who are somewhat receptive.The best that you can do with her is try to undermine her trust in the TV or really the system. That‚Äôs a hard job. Believe me, I understand. I have such people in my own house.Reading Covid, honestly, it‚Äôs become a cult. There‚Äôs no way to break through, especially, with women. It has everything for them. It‚Äôs scary, and women love security. It also allows them to nag, which they also love.Regarding TV and the hatred of Whites, one thing that won‚Äôt make you any friends but does seem to break the spell a bit is asking them what they‚Äôre going to do personally. For example, ask her what‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing about her own White privilege.White women love being on the side of angels, which in our current society means thinking of Whites as evil. They‚Äôre fine with that so long as it doesn‚Äôt mean any change in their own life, but when you start to push them on things in their own life.Will she move to a more diverse area?Will she give up half of her retirement savings to POC?Would she allow a black person to rob her?Is she okay with her kids getting passed over for jobs to make room for less qualified POC?They won‚Äôt like it and will say that‚Äôs just stupid. That‚Äôs when you have them, because you can honestly say that all of those things are what‚Äôs coming and things you deserve if you truly have White privilege.

                This is a variation of Gell-Mann amnesia.  Most people do not know anyone who died of covid, but they believe the death counts anyway.  And people who know someone who diedwithcovid, also are close enough to the situation to know the real cause of death.

        Diet is 90% of health.  Eat toxic foods and you will pay a steep price.   It‚Äôs not just that obese people eat too many calories (which they grotesquely do) they also eat lots of toxic industrial foods.   I do agree humans are omnivores, and that eating a wide range of foods is a good idea.   Things like the keto and paleo diets are clearly made up nonsense, but avoiding corn syrup and trans fats are just as clearly good things to do.There is a saying in the lifting community ‚Äì you can‚Äôt outwork a bad diet.   It applies more generally in life‚Ä¶

                I have found in my later years a decline in food enjoyment.  I eat, but have a much more natural tendency to fill up quickly and simply stop eating.  Such was never the case in my younger years.When the family gets together at holidays, I notice a particular tendency for some (most?) of the older, more obese members to load up with second, and even third helpings.  Often, even acknowledging such behavior with the statement, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs (Thanksgiving, Christmas, whatever)‚Äù.  As if this behavior is occasional.  But obviously from their girth and health, not very rare at all.  This is probably genetic as is much else we discuss.

        Media is like standing in the cereal isle. Corn and sugar or wheat and sugar. How would you like your sugar? Both!? Ah, fair and balanced.

My working theory is that we are in the final two months in a galactic feedlot. You know, when the alien ranchers and their deep state lizard hybrid ranch hands really put the weight on us and more importantly that corn-fed marbling. Thats all the flavor really.

This whole hoof and snout wuhan thing is spooky though. Wouldn‚Äôt want to get ‚Äúinfected‚Äù.

        95% of the time the Z Man is spot on, but using diet as a metaphor, in the case, was meh.yes if course genetics come into play. So does gender and a whole host of determinative things. Perhaps the absolute inequality of nature is the primary causal factor of poor health.HOWEVER.everything in moderation. ‚ÄúMan cannot live on bread alone.‚Äù Even someone without a genetic predisposition to diabetes will destroy the insulin cells in their pancreas if they eat cake and ice cream for every meal instead of a reasonably balanced diet. Yes, we are omnivores, and as such, we require an omnivorous diet or else we will suffer Ill health.It isn‚Äôt superstitious to believe this. It is intuitive.The overarching message here is true, because fad diets only encourage wild swings in weight, muscle mass, and metabolic chaos. This doesn‚Äôt mean that diet has no bearing at all on health.

        We still don‚Äôt understand human metabolism well.  Technically, we cannot synthesize certain esential amino acids (protein) and certain essential lipids (fats); but there is apparently no corresponding requirement for exogenous carbohydrates, despite their abundance in the world and our ability to metabolize them.  Orthorexia, which is a psychological disorder, has developed in the 21st century to fuel a billion-dollar industry parsing the merits of competing dietary claims that basically boils down to Team Meat versus Team Plant.  As Zman suggests, it may be driven by a completely different agenda than health.  Eat what you like in moderation.  You are going to die of something and some degree of physical pain, varying as to duration or intensity, is inescable.  You may as well enjoy something.  Even those who are being executed get to choose their last meal.

        This sort of thing comes about through ‚ÄúMarrying your Investment.‚Äù  People invest in something and they forget that the investment had some other purpose to it not a lifelong relationship.This is especially true of ideas. Often times someone will propose an idea with assumptions and caveats that require testing. Other people then invest in the idea and either forget or don‚Äôt know about the original assumptions and caveats and the idea gains a life of it‚Äôs own. At that point you can‚Äôt tell them a thing about the original thought because it‚Äôs outside their current investment.Ronald Reagan said it best about people knowing things that just aren‚Äôt true. I think he meant that in a general sense too.

                i think the point is, if you don‚Äôt have *adequate* nutrition (e.g. sufficient vitamin C), you are going to end up ‚Äúinside the extremes‚Äù.   this really is a shockingly silly hill to die on.

                The RDA for various vitamins/minerals was established generations ago and is apparently the bare minimum to prevent things like scurvy or other nutritional diseases.  The optimal amount for health/well being is generally a lot higher ‚Äì but you still have people repeating the axiom that Americans pee is full of vitamins.  And then you have people like my husband, who are convinced that all their over the counter vitamins will maintain health despite being primarily sedentary.

        There is simply too much information for any of us to mentally digest, and much of it gets streamlined into quick narratives, so we don‚Äôt end up on the floor in some sort of epileptic-like seizure from it all.  The narratives require authoritative sources, but in a world of lies and manipulation, how do you do the screening?  Furthermore, everyone has decided to pound the table about narratives they believe, so everyone is an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù about everything.

        When everything is a lie, news is narrative. Worse, we ourselves do it when reading or listening to it. Since everything is presented to us in narrative form, it is very easy to make subtle changes to their narrative while creating a new narrative which more closely follows our world view.

                    It‚Äôs almost like they called some Soviet universities and asked for English translations of Pravda training course material.It has pervaded every aspect of ‚Äújournalism,‚Äù not just the political stuff.  It is difficult to find a news story on literally any subject that is not presented as a narrative and as advocacy. They seem to be incapable of doing it.Yuri Bezmenov said that a demoralized people would be absolutely incapable of thinking.  I always took him with a major grain of salt. He is literally one guy with a minor job in India who after defection was very much useful to the CIA and other swamp creatures.  But it is getting more and more difficult by the day to ignore what he said.

A high sugar, high carb diet is very unhealthy and it causes insulin intolerance which can lead to fatigue, diabetes, and more.i had a serious health scare and began to read up on this stuff, and have since been following the Keto diet. Feel much better ‚Äì one of the smartest things i ever did to improve my health. Seriously, check it out guys.

            I suspect we are taking Z-man‚Äôs missive to an extreme and knocking down straw men.  Hard for me to believe Z-man would disagree that a diet extremely imbalanced toward empty calories like sugar is similar to a more balanced one with carb‚Äôs, fats and proteins.  On the other hand, a Keto diet is pretty trendy these days and one in a long line of fads.  If it works for you, fine‚Äîbut that is anecdotal, isn‚Äôt it?

        Once again Z pontificates on a subject that we have no reason to believe he knows anything more about than anybody else. Diet is one of those issues that everybody has an opinion about because nobody has ever been able to get a real handle on it. Z has as much right to his opinion as anybody, but his Olympian dismissal of all disagreement damages his own credibility. He does this again and again, on topic after topic, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to know when he‚Äôs doing it.(My own opinion is that diet does not determine your health, but it can influence it. I‚Äôve lost about 15 pounds over the past couple of years by emphasizing fruits and vegetables in my diet, and cutting back as much as possible on processed foods and baked goods. I know perfectly well there are no guarantees, but this still looks like an unqualified win to me).

                My wife had no cartilege in her knees after decades of running. We grew back a thin layer of anhylene, or ‚Äúscar‚Äù cartilege, back so she‚Äôs no longer experiencing daily pain. But running frequently can in fact destroy your knees and hip joints. Humans were not designed to run tens of miles over hard surfaces like asphalt and concrete.

        Now in case anyone is asking why there are so many nutrition and health  cranks out there. well its profitable for one as many people are sicker than they should be and second, people need to make a living.Most work people do is useless and unnecessary and I suspect that we could get by with maybe 20% of people actually working and lose little to no wealth.Problem is that would essentially  sterlize anyone with an IQ over 90 and Under 120 I.E , 80% of the population.

        Agree 100% on the diet nonsense. I used to be a fatty (at 43 y/o I was 265+ @ just under 6‚Äô2‚Ä≥) and my labs showed that my health was not great-(LDLs in the 170s, HDLs in the teens, high BP, high fasting glucose, etc.)4 yrs later and my morning weight now stays in the low to mid 180s, and I did it all eating mostly junk. Some days would be one large, solid meal mid morning, and then two pints of ice cream for dinner. Other days it was two double grease burger meals. Just depended on total calories. I kept it at 2650 to 2800 per day, and the weight fell off, no matter what I ate. If I was hungry, I‚Äôd snack on whatever I wanted and just make adjustments to the next meal or the next day. My health is now kick-ass (at least according to my labs) like I‚Äôm in the lowest possible heart attack risk group for my age, and my bone density, according to DEXA scan is way above average. I credit that to the barbell.

        Just my own experience. Several years ago my doctor was wanting me to lose weight and suggested I go gluten free, and recommended the book ‚ÄúWheat Belly‚Äù by William Davis, M.D. I had come across that book previously but had dismissed it as just another fad diet. But I took my dr‚Äôs advice and went gluten free. Lost 20-30 pounds the first 6 months. A year later at a luncheon, I said what the hell and ate a serving of the chocolate cake they were serving for dessert. Well, I had diarrhea all afternoon. So I‚Äôve made a point to remain gluten free ever since. Da is in his book seems to buy into the idea that today‚Äôs wheat is different from what was around 100 years ago. The big change came in the 1980‚Äôs when farmers began switching big time to planting recently developed hybrid strains. I for one don‚Äôt believe in forcing gluten free on anyone, but if the shoe fits, wear it. We are all different.

        I suppose it would be Gell-Mann in reverse if I were to go from appreciating your insights on politics to trusting you on dietary matters. I was more intrigued by your bringing in the abductive mind, which I had to look up. It‚Äôs an interesting concept, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs anything more than an aspect of inductive reasoning.

        Trog angered God in no way, if he honestly was looking for a meal or some resource in the woods, and not just tempting the bear to do what bears do‚Ä¶optimal human diet is low carb omnivory, btw, at least if we compare our digestive tracts to similar animals. oatmeal probably causes more colon cancer than it doesn‚Äôt. the fantasies dieticians peddle in part come from the seculars‚Äô need for replacement myths instead of divine truths, and in part because docs can be govcorp hucksters too. if your whole family has colon cancer, the doc‚Äôs whole family goes to college‚Ä¶ if it spreads to more organs, they got a shot at the ivy league.there might be some differences in diet based on historical and/or racial development too. medis tolerate wheat better than northseas, while northseas tolerate lactose and alcohol more (mead &gt; wine). both can be allergic to peanuts and other new world things that amerinds love, while amerinds can be very lactose intolerant because llama milk was not widely available. caucasoids did love transplanting potatoes, but they do gorge on them too much by now. amerinds and blacks had lots of fruit but no sugar nor bread and barely any alcohol, thus after the white man they became addicted to these things and prone to diabetes and heart disease (africanoids can withstand more due to size though). they did give the white man high blood pressure through coffee and tea‚Ä¶ and syphilis. asiatics digest rice better than wheat, but their smaller frames require less food; and so on.the historical development of diet seems even more important, as most traditional foods were cooked in peasant times: when lots more energy was needed to work outside in a fierce environment, and lots more natural foods were available. after an industrial interregnum where our masters fed us industrial glop from cans to build the freemasonic world, today we live instead like pod hamsters: yet want to gorge like rats on every taste advertised as possible, yet also wanting to be as thin and fit as the magazines say is possible. so of course we are unhealthy and need govcorp pills, and all kinds of taxmoney for all kinds of public and private healthcare ‚Äúprograms‚Äù; just to get by, like the nwords say. and then you are told you need a mask for the flu 2.0, too‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs hoping we wake up from secularist mysticism, so we don‚Äôt simply obey to what scientists do because they just do it.

        If you want the truth, you must be self-loving enough to see when you deserve more than what people think you should have but self hating to see where you deserve less than what they think you should have.

To some extent, culture is a simulation. Math is real. Fiction is fiction. Culture is somewhere in the middle. It is half real and half pretend. Upward mobility lies more with what is pretend though, so that‚Äôs why people are oriented toward BS..

        The study cited in the article I have linked states a balance of carbs is optimal, and I am inclined to believe it over you because I trust they would factored out things not to do with diet. Outcomes are 50% genes and 50% environment in most things and probably in health too. Bad genes may override a good diet, but a good diet may extend your life a few years longer. It is not all genes as you seem to say. While genes can go a lot worse than diet by causing terminal cancer in children, a bad diet can kill you four years early. We notice the genetic problems more because they can be more obvious and dramatic‚Äìat least for an individual.https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45195474People believe what makes them feel good. You think diet doesn‚Äôt matter because perhaps you have a heterodox one? Or because you don‚Äôt regulate yours?If you want to find someone who tells the truth, find someone who is self-hating and narcissistic in just the right combination so that they will believe things that make them feel good but also make them feel bad in just the right combination so they arrive at truth.

        There is a UK scientist who follows diet studies as a hobby. He has come to the conclusion that we only know two things about diet:


1. Don‚Äôt eat too much


2. Don‚Äôt eat just one thing


I would add a third one (courtesy of Taleb in one of his saner moments)


3. Don‚Äôt consume anything that hasn‚Äôt been consumed for 1000 years

        I‚Äôve noticed lately, since this COVID bullshit, that people are constantly admitting to me that they gained weight without me even asking. I‚Äôve lost weight. I‚Äôm not eating out anymore. I‚Äôm talking really out. Like in a transmission fluid stained parking lot out‚Ä¶ I was getting pretty close to not eating out anymore before all this. Fellow dinners watching something on a dumb phone with the speaker on makes me want to stick a fork in their eye. Especially when its a kid watching the latest (((Pixar))) offering. Kid first, then dad and dad, I live in LA.cooking at home and letting myself be a little hungry at some point during the day seems to help. I‚Äôve had to cut way back on the brewskis and meat because of gout. That sucks. But it‚Äôs sure helped. I don‚Äôt know if they allow fast food to be bought with food stamps in other parts of the country, they do here and sounds like a bad idea to me. Did any of you abducted minds see Giuliani‚Äôs press conference today ? He seemed to be melting. There was either hair dye or blood dripping down the side of his head onto his collar. He remained me of Simon-Bar-Sinister. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could take him even a little seriously.

        Unusually polemic and must be critiqued today!  in polite conversation, we are not supposed to discuss money, religion or politics. I say let us be real and let the chips fall where they may. If that makes me impolite, so be it.Um, for openers: Our side of the divide is immune to magical thinking? Oh really? You rightly note that ‚ÄúLots of smart and thoughtful people cling to ideas that are superstitious and primitive.‚Äù Do you really believe in the inivisible man in the sky or some such magic? Many here claim to. Religion has many good aspects, but it has many more bad ones. Rather than condemn all religions, suffice it for me to say right here that many organized religions hold tenets that have real-world consequences, both good and evil. Frankly, I‚Äôm not impressed by the set of superstitions you learnt as a young child. On the other hand, if you have beliefs or theories that do or can affect the world we live in, and you can argue a persuasive case (Preferably without chopping my head off at dawn if I don‚Äôt agree), then I‚Äôd love to hear your arguments.Then Z asserts that the belief that our diet determines our health is ‚Äúcomplete nonsense.‚Äù Granted, he does backpedal this a bit. But any categorical claim is a red-flag that must be carefully examined, as it has a high chance of being false.As is this one. I‚Äôm not a dietician, but clearly neither is Z. There is plenty to criticize in the standard American diet. Excess is probably the most salient. Too much of any category, or correspondignly too little of another, is a recipe for bad health. Or, do you really think humans can survive on an all-carb, or all-fat diet? How long do you think you will remain healthy without essential vitamins and minerals? Seriously, Z, perhaps you are being sarcastic and I fell for it, but if not, this is drivel unworthy of your usual high quality prose: ‚Äú[D]iet has little to no impact on your health‚Äù ‚Ä¶ well if you choose to believe so. I‚Äôm sure glad I‚Äôm not your body, if you really live by those words.The rest of today‚Äôs essay is the more usual well-balanced thought that we‚Äôre used to.Ideas that claim to affect the real world should be tested precisely that way: How well, in practice, does this theory work in the real world? Yes, our enemies seem to wallow in fantasy, but our side is by no means immune. Nor should we necessarily condemn a man for one or two weird beliefs, if the bulk of his output is of high value. Now let‚Äôs go back to sparring about politics, sports and culture.

            In my ongoing readings of Buddhism, this is (to me) one of the logical truths of Buddhism: the universailty of dukka, usually called ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù but more accurately ‚Äúdissatisfaction‚Äù with the way things are. ‚ÄúCraving‚Äù ties in with suffering (I‚Äôm not fully up to speed on the distinction). Impermanence: everything arises and fades away. As you said, at least one commentary says that the fundamental problem of human existence is disappointment with the way the real world is (= dukka) and people live in ‚Äúignorance‚Äù of true reality, instead trying to change the world to reflect our desires (perhaps this is the craving). This is just another elaborate way of stating the eternal problem of mind vs. reality, of human wants vs. what reality is capable of delivering. I admire Buddha‚Äôs teachings, there is a lot of logic in them. On the other hand, there is much fantasy too. The moral teachings are impeccable, and the concept of karma has its place, as does sin in Christianity. But I have difficulty accepting that we all have had countless past lives, and are doomed to countless lives in the future (Samsara), unless we ‚Äúextinguish‚Äù ourselves by finding Nirvana. Of the other worlds, there are three lower and several higher realms. Apparently the only realm in which a person can make spiritual progress is the Earthly realm. How convenient! üôÇ
