        To piggy back on your comment about the anti White machine slowing just a bit – I’ve noticed that at my company, we see less of this stuff.  I remember getting emails about combatting hate when the Buffalo shooter thing happened, but then they stopped sending those after a number of negro shootings happened.  I also noticed that our HR department has been strangely quiet during the election cycle.  4 years ago there were a lot of emails about recommended opinions.  I’ve also noticed that board room promotions still have mostly Whites getting them, albeit more women unfortunately.I have no delusions that these people have run out of steam, but I do think these machines have lost a lot of their effectiveness.  What I’d like to see is the Trump admin get laws signed in that inflict severe penalties for any corporation/organization that promotes DEI.  If it were up to me it’d be punishable by labor camps or worse however I’ll take any deterrent.  Any school that promotes anti White teaching instantly loses all funding and teachers can be criminally prosecuted for teaching kids CRT or any of these other ridiculous ideologies.I know none of this will actually happen but one can dream, right?  In a sane world, Trump’s admin would step on the necks of the left.  Go after that black retard Leticia James.  Destroy her life along with that low IQ feral, Alvin Bragg.  Let it be known that negros who step out of line will be destroyed.  Then people like Merrick Garland would be next, along with the entire department of (in)justice.  Show no mercy.

            I want to see the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ gutted and reformed into an agency that attacks view point discrimination. Go after corporations for firing employees who hold unpopular opinions. Facilitate class action suits against banks for cutting off dissidents. They can even go after state AG’s who use lawfare.

                Trump should go after university endowments, which are nothing more than printing presses used to promote Marxist indoctrination and provide a cushy support system for Marxist parasites.
These endowments also permit universities to hugely distort their local economies. Between these endowments and gov’t subsidies there is no such thing as a recession in a college town.

                    Another idea would be a requirement that a certain percentage of the endowment must be spent every year on students and faculty…Harvard has obscene amounts of money, yet still charges a high tuition, albeit the lowest in the Ivy League…

                        There is a common misperception that endowments are without rules for expenditure—this is incorrect.  You can easily look these rules up.  I can even list them, but it’s long, varied, and complicated.In addition, most all endowments are under supervision by a Board of Governors, here in AZ A Board of Regents.That one does not like the rate of expenditure or what expenditures are made is another story.  Harvard for example has perhaps the largest endowment of all.  They charge tuition because they can, no because they have too!  That is a value judgement you have made.I’m not convinced tinkering via Fed regulation is the answer, not that there is a problem—except where the public is made to subsidize such endowments through favorable tax legislation as we do charities.

                            I know little about the specifics of endowments in academia. However, I’m far past standing on the principle of governmental non-interference in state affairs. The Left made hay by weaponizing fedgov against the states and white people. Consequently, I’m blissfully unconcerned with using that selfsame weapon as a flamethrower to incinerate academia.

                                The point is that it won’t incinerated academia.  Most schools have modest endowments, relatively speaking.  Controlling how they are spent will most likely drive donors into other outlets of contribution, which would be outside government control.
Look for how endowments in the hands of institutions are subsidized by government and remove such.  That’s simply good conservative governance.  Specifically directing them to be spent in specific ways I’m not sure is the answer.

                                    “The point is that it won’t incinerated academia.”
Perhaps not if fedgov and stategov machinations are confined to endowments, but I’m advocating scorched earth rather than restraint. By whatever method, the academic archipelago should be sown with salt. It was the engine of America’s destruction and could well destroy western civilization if left remotely to its own devices.

                            How about just taking the endowments completely if they persist with DEI and affirmative action and the like? seems like a good idea to me. If they persist seize the colleges and shut them down. Also, make it clear that their graduates are to be unemployable to government and its contractors.

                It’ll be interesting if Vance or Miller understand this. I’d suspect Trump doesn’t.
Now, Trump does understand certain kinds of lawfare, but viewpoint discrimination probably isn’t on his radar.

            We want to see—and need to see—a reëducation campaign for “white” Americops. Good lessons can be learned from heads drilled with the pension seekers’ own Glocks. I foresee also some eye sockets burned with their own zappers, wrists gouged with their own cuffs and zip ties, and night sticks broken with their own bones. Imagine also bodies being bounced by Krav Maga method.
May school be in session by the summer of 2026, and attendance of all obtuse collaborators, mandatory in all jurisdictions of the Globalist American Zempire.

                            This sort of idiocy on stilts dates at least as far back as the 90s. My favorite example is a Lee Jeans ad set in some lakeside Rocky Mountain fastness whereupon we observed a young darkie couple round the campfire strumming the ol’ Dobro and warbling some Woody Guthrie tune.
One could only gawk as shrieking incongruity of it all. But you can be sure the ad execs behind it were jacking one another off over destroying a so-called “stereotype.” :rolleyes:

                    On the coffee tables of very high end places (top architects, plastic surgeons in wealthy enclaves, top neighborhood socialite magazines … …), you won’t see what they show you. You will see genetic perfection in a single skin tone.My favorite was when going through the south in states like, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia tourism magazines all had near total erasure of white men. The noble afficionados of blue-blood horse racing and the bourbon and wine trails finally tasting the high life in the magazine. Meanwhile the men who invented and built and cultivated it all – gone. Cultural Genocide.These things are regime strongholds so I don’t expect it to dial down at all. There is also the issue that the most powerful play both sides so assuming we are still target number one, don’t expect it change. As part of parallelism we need our own magazines, tv, productions … …Then there are the in-store billboards. Don’t expect the 380 lb, unkempt, gap-toothed models to go away either. My recent favorite were the model ads in the skin care section that featured black people with that disease where their skin gets discolored (the one Michael Jackson had). One had it all over her face. Wasn’t such an inviting image.You won’t see that in the Tony locations I discussed at the top of my comment. They truly are rubbing our noses in it.We will have to ghetto-ize ourselves until or unless we regain sovereignty over our own homelands. Looks like someone will make a fortune creating an “Ivory” magazine and a WET … … Better one of our kind than the people who decided long ago to ghetto-ize us in our own homelands.

                Ostei – I had that the selfsame thought. I don’t think one could stomach, nor invest the effort to measure this objectively – but perhaps like tidal flows which are only noticeable after some time – we’ll know if there really is an ebb.

                    This is my biggest concern. Trump was allowed to win for some reason and a draft or luring young white men back into the military is a good candidate for the motive. Even if Trump plays along, my guess is young white men will not.

                        I don’t think so, because the clearest bat signal that war is off the menu was the Bad Orange Man eviscerating the odious Cheney woman just a week ago and by extension the neocon warmongers in the Kagan circle of war hawks. The other strong indication that shit ain’t happening is the selection of JD Vance as Vice President, who also publicly repudiated the Ukraine War, and is not a retarded heretic Evangelical slobbering for war with Iran for Bagel Land like Mike Pence is. It is significant Joe Dirt was a Marine enlisted man, and thus understands from personal experience that stupid Forever Wars are to be avoided at all costs, with a far different perspective than “Lap Dog” Mattis in 2016. JD Vance is not going to be a purely symbolic Vice President, like affable dunce Joe Biden was for Obama, or a diversity hire like Harris, or a scummy Vichy collaborator like Pence. I hope Vance is President Trump’s strong right hand.

                            Vance, at least rhetorically, can give Our Greatest Ally the biggest tongue bath imaginable, Vatican II version rather than Fundie, but he is whip smart enough to know it has to be done whether he is onboard or not. I suspect he will be one of the loudest voices about shutting down Project Ukraine, though, and may be quietly based enough to keep Netanyahu on a tight leash.

        Part of the puzzle of the Regime’s quiescence might be the realization that the Bad Orange Man, unlike last time, does not have to rely on the Vichy Right, and has a small but growing elite backing combined with a popular mandate, both missing in 2016, and might be Serious about purges to the Apparat, in which case the “Resistance” that they were so enamored of performing might carry consequences this time around besides mean Tweets. They’re truly afraid in 2024’s interregnum in a way they were not in 2016, because this Trump just might possibly have learned a thing or two since his first administration.

            Combine that with the rumor — which I believe — that Trump was literally a vanity candidate in 2015: Obama made fun of him at that correspondent’s dinner, and he got mad, and decided to avenge himself on the Magic Negro. The man has a dismaying ability to avoid learning in a lot of fields, but he understands revenge. If they don’t manage to roll out another shooter or five, the Dreaded Private Sector might be looming for more than a few people in the Swamp.

                It also needs to be said that Trump has spent the past four years literally fighting for his life and the life of his family. The regime wanted nothing more than to seize all his property, throw him in jail, put embarrassing photos of him in prison on the front page of the NYT, make sure his children can never make a buck ever again, and write articles laughing about it. He knew it, and for that reason I can’t really blame him for cutting deals with some of the worst scum on earth even if I think he was over the top on some of the things he said. He knows he needs people on his side that can fight fire with fire, ambitious and intelligent people like JD Vance not old establishment cucks like Mike Pence.What that will mean for governance, I have no idea. But it does mean that he is absolutely not the guy he was in 2016, and even being older and not as sharp, he has a much better grasp on reality and of his enemies.

                    I thought Trump’s choosing Vance for a running mate instead of another nonentity like Pence was a hopeful sign. Sure Vance is likely to disappoint (or worse) serious dissidents at times. But he seems to express actual opinions rather than empty platitudes. I can’t say I’ve followed JDV closely during this agon, but from what I’ve seen he projects a measure of charisma.Trump 2.0 may have developed political smarts and is no longer the shoot-from-the-hip guy who relies on salesmanship, personal loyalty of his team, and tweets. He is intelligent enough for a politician; we’ll see if he adds shrewdness.

                        My feeling is that he is going to leave a lot of the actual governing to Vance. He’s old, he’s been fighting tooth and nail for a long time, he’s quite frankly not that good at it. He will tell Vance what he wants to do and expect Vance to figure out how to actually do it, as opposed to sending it to some diffuse group of unaccountable RNC hacks like Reince Priebus that tossed it in the garbage the second he got it.Will Vance do it, is of course, the question. Will the administration have more effective people like Stephen Miller is another question.

                Anecdotal, but a friend was a writer at NYT in the early ’90s, regularly skewered Trump in print which earned him many visits by DJT, during one wooing visit Trump said, watch Richard, I’m going to be fucking president one day! It was at least in his mind back in ’92.  After the Obama insult he could see it was his time.

            I think this is mostly correct. Trump was a black swan in 2016; nothing much more than energy and gall with a band of merry extremely online anons behind him. The only “legitimate” people he had on board were Paul Manafort and Steve Bannon, and odd congresspeople like Jeff Sessions. He was coming into the Presidency a lonely man, needing help and friends. He got “friends” like Paul Ryan.Trump in 2020, and moreso in 2024, has a lot more official support, and genuine people willing to join the cause without worrying about what the media says. I have high hopes for him this time around.

                Not exactly:“Trump was a black swan in 2016; nothing much more than energy and gall with a band of merry extremely online anons behind him. The only “legitimate” people he had on board were Paul Manafort and Steve Bannon, and odd congresspeople like Jeff Sessions.”Sheldon Adelson, the casino Zionist who died in Jan 2021, told DJT in May 2016 that he would support DJT with more than $100m if necessary. There were other such supporters, too, for that campaign.Dreamy:“I have high hopes for him this time around.”RFK and Musk are learning to bend the knee toward Har Zion. Gabbard has learned already. Tucker Carlson is an idiot whose skepticism about Israel is best considered wobbly. Vance is pozzed. We’ll know that the bending is complete when we see new pictures of each during post-election visits to the Crybully Wall. The guys will be wearing yarmulkes like good little servants, and probably Jared K. or even Ben S. will be on hand as minders.So the best to hope for is, I think, that DJT is not manipulated or coerced into full military participation in Zion’s war to eliminate regional impediments to Zionist unipolarism. Maybe somebody in the SS, or posing as an SS agent, will put a round through his empty head and some of his dirty, rotten boys. (Please, oh please, let it be an agent who survived the vetting process.) The deed(s) will send a correct message to every lowlife R about what it needs to stop doing.

            I think it’s a whole lot simpler than that. The Left can’t run a damn thing. All they can do is cobble together legislation that can’t possibly work. Then Republicans take charge and they take a perverse pleasure in the challenge of getting these horrible ideas operational. No matter how many of their constituents get screwed.
Not necessarily just elected office, either. The Left’s lawyers were so stupid their argument in favor of Obamacrap’s individual mandate would have meant it was unconstitutional. Roberts saved the day — if we call it a tax, it passes muster. Rat bastard.

                    Remember when there was a big stink about Bush firing people in the DOJ even though Slick Willie had replaced everybody at the beginning of his administration? They can scream as much as they want this time around. People on our side aren’t paying attention to them. Plus, the cucks whose first instinct is to capitulate to them, have mostly been sidelined. They don’t have any say in the matter anymore.

            Solid point.  Political strategists seem to not have aptitude for strategy.  Larger issue is – as you note – whether quiescent or not, the anti-western civilizational left remains the left.  The civnats are out in force, reminding everyone “we’re all Americans.”  That irresistible urge to kiss and make up, to trust the untrustworthy, will continue to damn the ‘nice guys’ to defeat.  Because really, all they need to do is wait.  Another 4 years, another few million Whites dead or demented, another few million non-White births.  While some ‘silents’ like Biden and Polosi still cling to a simulacrum of life, they are finally dying out, along with the older boomers.  The numerkans are primarily ‘of color.’

                    I think the reason for that is, most people on our side want to live and let live. It’s not in our DNA to start our days angry and bitter, looking to screw with someone.It’s hard for people to be malicious, who are not wired that way.If you have the chance, watch the movie “Serenity”, the capstone of the “Firefly” series. The antagonist tells Mel “I’m a monster. There’s no place for me in your world”. And yet, he believed he was making the universe a better place. Think John Wayne in “TheSeekers”. The people who hired him didn’t want him around after the dirty work was done.The Diner owner wants the dirty work to be done, and then the people who do it, to leave.I agree with you…hell no.Sorry for the ramble.

                    Keep in mind that the propaganda apparatus of the Power Structure will always seek out conservatives who tell Leftists–and other conservatives–what the apparatus wants them to hear. They are never going to interview Lineman saying that Trump should whup the shit outta the nuggras, banish all the Messkins, and gibbet the Judeo-Puritans on lampposts. This approach keeps us docile and prevents us from getting any ideas that might actually destroy the Left.

                Trump should make nice with the voters who normally vote Democratic that voted for him this time.  He did make serious inroads with jewish, hisapanic, asian, and african-american voters, especially of the traditionalist male variety.  So attempting to enact public policy that benefits all americans, not just while european decedents, makes sense tactically, and possibly strategically.   Consolidating gains and legacy loom larger now.But no, he should show no mercy on the specific people that sought his ruin and death.  Don’t forgive and don’t forget.  Old Testament justice is still the most effective at sending messages that need to be understood.  Lawfare, cutting off security clearances and government funds, targeted assassinations of his foes, etc.   Leave no option off the table.  Unless there is vengeance extracted, they will never cease being spiteful mutants.

        Zman, you’ve said before that the ruling class and its obedient servants only think one move ahead, and I think that’s at least partially in play here.Regarding the Biden debate: the entire commentariat had long before signed onto the role as uncritical Biden boosters, because that’s where the power was. When he befouled himself in the debate, the press reacted hysterically because it was an embarrassment to THEM: a clear exposure of their lies and gullibility, and thus an indictment of their credibility going forward.After the Biden panic, they eagerly switched gears to Harris because following power is all they know, and they were betting that the Dem party would pull out another victory by hook or crook.But the feeling of unease over the Biden panic, the realization that they had been so close to losing their cherished sinecures, is still a fresh memory. They haven’t had time to forget it. So now they’re wary about “acting out” too vociferously in the face of Trump’s victory. The new leftist power has not yet emerged; the media folk don’t know whom to look to for their next set of orders; so they’re keeping mum for now until they are informed which ass to kiss next.

            Incidentally, we were given a window into this process in the final week of the election season.During the panic about how Trump had supposedly called for the execution of Liz Cheney, neocon Jonah Goldberg (formerly of National Review) denounced Trump (for the umpteenth time) on some televised panel. It was clearly a pro-forma denunciation, just following the herd (and probably following orders).But a day later, he tweeted a retraction, apologizing that Trump had obviously NOT said what Goldberg’s colleagues and he himself were alleging.So what happened here? Obviously Goldberg had never even heard the original Trump quote (or didn’t care about what was actually said); he had merely been told to react to the interpretation given him, and he dutifully obliged. But as a Trump victory began to seem a strong possibility, he saw that his future credibility (and thus employment) was at stake, and he “moderated” his position—bowing to the new emergent power.Whether Jonah “evolves” into a Trumpist convert remains to be seen. But wherever he ends up, he will only ever be a whore to power.

                There’s always the possibility that the Neocons will switch horses again and come back to the GOP now that Trump is back in the saddle (they are good at it). The fact that Trump is still chummy with Pompeo is not a good sign.

Guns, knives, poisons, compromising information, a goon squad, shyster lawyers, tons of cash, and the ability to censor and control information.Then you launch every single weapon in volleys of attacks.  Your stores are emptied, and the weapons you have left are easily countered.What, exactly, are you going to attack with?That’s where Democrats are today.  And in 73 days Trump is going to have full access to an unlimited weapons chest – many of the same weapons – and the ability to wipe out your shyster lawyers and goon squads.Democrats’ only weapon right now is to cry “Please sir.  Mercy?”

        I think that surprises me the most (and I expected Maximal Fortification, so that’s saying something). I figured we’d have the equivalent of the Rodney King riots by now, if not Kent State. One wonders if, in the fulness of time, St. Kyle of Kenosha’s acquittal might not have been the turning point. If they think for a hot second that the people they usually thump with the full connivance of the cops might be allowed to defend themselves…

        I’m still puzzled by the Harris/Walz ticket. As the smoke clears from the battlefield, it’s hard to imagine a more hapless campaign. Was the DNC trolling its own supporters? As with everything that happens in AINO, something smells fishy about it.
I don’t expose myself to the MSM, but I am curious to know if they are doing any hard soul searching regarding that disappearance of ten million votes, or if –because reasons– that is something better left undiscussed,

            My assumption has been that the “stronger” potential VP candidates caught the stink of Loser on Harris, and didn’t want to be associated with her, and thus diminish their personal ambitions. Walz, then, was the only guy who’d come onboard—he had nothing to lose, everything to gain, and (crucially) little in the way of self respect.It’s at that point that the characters in command of the party arrogantly figured they could troll their voters, and the country, with a certifiable weirdo. After all, they were already doing it with the ho at the top of the ticket.Good riddance to them; but I’m sure they’ll be given a soft landing and large payout.

                When Walz made his incredibly out of touch pep-talks, I realized the people on top thought this was a winner with men, and were shocked it went over like a lead balloon. Then they switched to the porn angle and somehow made it even worse.

                Agree, Walz was probably third choice. No one with plausible future political ambition wanted anything to do with that race.  Harris is trash, her staff is trash (some personal knowledge here), and Walz will be an unperson in a week.

            They were completely out of touch. They arrogantly and condescendingly thought the voters were stupid enough to buy their transparently fake bullshit. They actually thought that white men would identify with Walz because he was a National Guard grifter and REMF and that his fake pheasant hunting act would get the gun bros to vote for him. They actually thought that Howard University was the best place for their 25% black, 25% white, and 50% Subcontinental candidate’s election night HQ.One look at Harris’s campaign manager tells you everything you need to know about how out of touch they were.Jen O’Malley Dillon (51478518857) (cropped) – Jen O’Malley Dillon – Wikipedia

                The Harris campaign was run by a bunch of uber-empowered, entitled Karens.  Duh, what else? They are so out of touch — so utterly devoid of understanding men — that they assumed that a photo-op with Walz and a shotgun on a fake pheasant hunt would convert the reprobates (us).
It was stunningly, head-shakingly stoopid and lame.  But that’s KareNation.

            I just think the Dems are deep into fakery and narrative-building, to the exclusion of everything else beautiful and natural.Their supporters are so shallow and conformist that the Dems assume – rightly – that they could put forward nearly anyone and then gaslight him/her into popularity. (Well, anyone except a Zionist.)This again proved true. We (and it turns out, most people) could see the ridiculous charade that was Harris-Walz. But because the Dems have developed their “talent” according to who can emote better to prepared lines, rather than who can be a human being better, they end up with those two.I think the Dems could have done well with Bernie or Amy Klobuchar. But they were real people, and could speak off the cuff. That’s a no-go for the Dems. If I were the GOP right now, I’d be sending every under-50 candidate to Rogan or Theo Von or Dave Smith to have meandering discussions.

                Exactly.  Most all the money goes to replenish US weapons stockpiles through US companies, while the remainder goes to pay Ukraine government salaries since they no longer have a functioning economy.

                    It’s a lesson for those waiting for an undeniable collapse, after which—something wonderful.The Ukrainian economy is even more destroyed than it always was and its government performs none of a state’s legitimizing Enlightenment functions, but the people are stillruled,down to individual kidnappings that will probably go on until the last normal man is dead.The boys in local blue do exactly as they’re told, or they die. The peopleflee—into slavery, often—or they die.Whatstillprevents their rebellion? Instagram videos of what normal life the regime still allows?Who are those people?The Ukrainians are very, very like us. Not much but language separates us. They’re losing decisively—losing everything, forever. They’re beingtransitioned to myth, like us. They’re almost there. And there was no moment when revolution became possible.

                        Bleak and sharp analysis. It’s not a slim reed to hold onto, but the Ukrainian fuzz are in place to shepherd fellow countrymen to their deaths only because of the cards and letters keep flowing from the United States and Europe. When the collapse happens in the United States, there will be no foreign gibs and a descent into warlordism in urban areas will make the cannon fodder option look pleasant.Until just only recently the Beautiful People still lived large in Kiev courtesy of American Soma. A few hundred miles east and the last trace of Huxley’s master work is used as fuel to keep warm in winter. Xi now sends fentanyl rather than cocaine north from Mexico and there is no reason to think his hidden tender mercy will manifest post-collapse.The Ukrainians are us, past, present and future.

        All this is consistent with the Team B victory. (Team A wants White genocide immediately, while Team B is fine with White genocide, but became gravely concerned that Team A’s incompetence about everything would lead to America losing its power an ability to deliver Team B’s other priorities. Thus, Team B installs Trump.)The pause in vote counting in PA &amp; GA, as well as the strange hesitancy to call those races, indicate that the media weren’t sure if Team A would get their ballot machines cranked up again. Unlike 2020, Team B were not going to allow it, so it didn’t happen.Spare a thought for Team A in these next days, as they work out how to play in this new environment. They must be holding out a slight possibility that Trump publishes proscription lists &amp; unleashes the RWDS. For that outcome, of course, we devoutly pray.

                Team B might not be on-board with the replacement these days, depends on whether they grok the inability of American wonder weapons to be the only determinative factor in all the wars they want. If they really understand that you can’t win these wars without Whites, they might change their minds.

            With all the celebrations going on, it is sobering to realize that Harris/Walz got at least 66 million votes and carried eighteen states (including mine). These two turkeys would have been thoroughly crushed not long ago and possibly not carried a single state. We are still in a lot of trouble.

        One thing I am grateful for is that my acquaintances with Trump derangement syndrome are saying nothing about the election. The calm and quiet are much needed relief from the litany of regurgitated MSM shrieking about how Orange Man Bad!!! Especially since I’m in Canada, and it’s NOT OUR ELECTION. I hope they put a tenth of the energy into cleaning up the mess at home that they put into hating President Trump.

            I found it a very muted reaction here also, in fact one tds’r acknowledged yesterday he’d listened to a couple Americans describing why DJT was an attractive choice. That fb post was very much an example of the perhaps the spell is breaking. Nothing compared to the insanity from 2016 thru 2020 – although virtually all of those people unfriended me. We still have our mess here is an understatement right?

        As the resident optimist I feel obligated to come out of my cage once again and demonstrate what is wrong with me.The Dissidents are correct in that there is no hope whatsoever for our political class. They are worthless, irredeemable and the only thing that will fix them is a bullet between the ears. Power and money corrupt and there is no possible way to deal with that.You are correct, Z in the muted reaction. I saw candid photos of Kackula, Obutthole and Stretch Pelosi reacting to the win and as somebody who made a living reading people… I saw fear in their faces.My hope and optimism is in the white American people themselves. A lot of masks slipped over the last decade and regular folks saw it. Even your arch enemy on Blab – your evil black jewish brother – Cornelius Rye – was urging people to get out and “voat harder.” And lo and behold – the normies, the grillers, the boomers and geriatrics turned off the TV and went out to vote. Not only that, they filmed the skullduggery, took video, got names and pushed back at the shenanigans. Americans won’t put up with this shite.If it continues they WILL do something about the people trying to force it. It’s all fun and games until the local troon in your kids high school is raping the girls in their locker rooms, or the black baboons imported from Haiti are in YOUR neighbourhood. The defections of leftist powerhouses like Tulsi and RFK speak volumes of a tectonic shift in American politics. We are seeing it here in Canada too. WE can play dirty tricks too… and if things keep going down this road we will. Count on it. You can bet the Establishment received that message loud and clear. They can either knock it off, straighten out and fly right or face the consequences. If Trump goes on the warpath the people will be supportive.I dunno if Trump is the man that will save America… but if not, he will certainly pave the way for the man that does.Don’t be at all surprised if that man doesn’t turn out to be one of you bums here.

        Trump won, but he was ALLOWED to win.  It could’ve been stolen again just the same as 2020 and 2022.  There was an agreement at the very top that Trump would be there man.  Bezos and Zuck tweet out compliments, no endorsement from LA Times or WaPo, David Sachs being pro-Trump, ADL sends congratulations, and other things.Those at the top and in intel made the decision to LET Trump win.  To protect the Jews and Israel?  To be a fall guy?  Just because they decided it was more stable and in their interests?  Who knows the exact reasons, but I’m glad Trump is in instead of Cackles.

                Some notable antifa characters are old friends of mine and I know what they’re about. They’re all true believers in the mission: tophysically punish fascism. Keep the right off the streets.Over the course of American antifa’s existence, its definition of fascism has shifted—it’s been guided—fromsuburban whiteness(the “Adornoite” definition) tonot being a Democrat. Today it’s a 100% partisan, establishment/counter-revolutionary organization that truly thinks itself ideological-vanguardist. It doesn’t know it’s a branch of the U.S. military (or “security state” if you don’t enjoy the full implications there).The rhetoric of the last weeks of the campaign—MSG-as-Nazi-rally from all the media, outright naming-the-fascist by the Party, etc.—was their signal to prepare. “Why are they saying all this weird shit? Nobody believes it!” It’s not for public consumption.Then the army was called off.If that decision was purely practical, I think it was a matter of them—nefarious Them—believing the polls: Trump was voted in not by boomer grandpas and “tradwife” influencers but by an all-ages multiracial coalition ofmen. That’s a worthy physical enemy, from which antifa, like any cop, will always cower.Frankly, I think Thiel—metonymic Thiel, as leader of his organization(s), with probably zero personal decision-making power—is the true commander-in-chief of the Democrats’ armies, from antifa to the migrant hordes.He—not him but nefarious He—is waiting. If Trump misbehaves, the boys deploy.Trumpfailing to die before inaugurationmight be considered misbehavior. If so, that’s the day.

            Somebody mentioned that you don’t rob the same bank twice in a row, and I think there’s something to that too. If you want your “democracy” to endure, you can’t blatantly steal every election, make the count take days and weeks in every election. Maintaining legitimacy requires the appearance of legitimacy. Regime stability is perhaps better served by enduring 4 years of Trump than by defeating him at all costs. Which of course we’ve puzzled over as to why they didn’t think of that before. I’ve heard it said that they can manage 4 years of Trump, but they were afraid of 8 consecutive years of Trump.

            Ten million disappearing votes tell the tale. The fraud machine was put out of commission. The oligarchs have decided that Trump isn’t so bad after all. I hope they are wrong.

                Still only 83% of the vote counted, with Trump near 73 million and Harris just over 68. Do the math, and I’m not sure those votes are really going to be missing once it is all counted.

                    Well if that is true then you have a point. Adding the uncounted 17% to the 141 million already counted, we are dealing with almost 170 million votes. That’s suspiciously high, being nearly 50% of the country (in 2020 it was over 46%, which was by far a record). If the remaining ballots go 51% Trump, 48% Harris, our popular vote would work out to be 81.6 million for Harris, 88.4 million for Trump.
So, yeah, point made.

                        Of course, what do you want to bet that those residual piles of votes turn out to go more like 65-35 Harris? Now the count is almost 87 million votes for Harris, and presto, she wins the popular vote.**I was chastened by Compsci the other day for making a big deal of the popular vote count. My point then – and again here – is that the enemy and its operatives in the Media enjoy de-legitimizing our victories by citing these figures and calling for the abandonment of the EC. It works on a lot of voters who don’t understand the purpose of the EC. Ohio should not be ruled by California, any more than Denmark should be ruled by Germany, just because it has fewer people.

                            Little doubt she would lead among what remains to be counted, since so much of it is from California (don’t know why they are just refusing to count their votes, it’s been 48hrs for crying out loud, and they counted virtually nothing today), but even so, it looks like he will remain the PV winner. He gets a few million more from CA also.

        I think Z’s ending metaphor is apt (glad to see he is taking the Blackpill again – a.k.a. facing reality 🙂 ). The anti-Trump hysteria is eerily lacking, but we can be sure the anti-Trump and anti-White sentiment has not disappeared. I would venture a few possible reasons.1) Like a spoiled child being ignored, they recognize this tactic has lost effectiveness, so they are recalibrating.2) Reality (slightly) knocked – they cannot fully project their Hitler fantasies, for they already had four years of Trump where nothing happened. To clarify, they still believe he is Hitler, but reality has slightly mitigated the hysteria; i.e., this will not be the end of the world.3) The gaslighting has left them stunned; they are more shocked than horrified.4) In Christianity, before the most wicked act humans ever did, they counseled: Adam and Eve discussed before eating of the Fruit. These orcs, as Z said, are probably quietly counseling to bring even further wickedness in a new form.…now I know/ That twenty centuries of stony sleep/ Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle/  And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,/ Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

        You are overlooking the fact that Trump is Israel’s candidate. He is a staunch, maybe fanatical, Zionist, and he will give Netanyahu a free hand in his genocide and Iran war plans. Harris and Walz, however, are suspected as being closet Palestinian supporters. So the Israeli lobby would not support another stolen election, like 2020, and their support of Trump led to his victory.
Expect a very large Middle Eastern war, which could easily go global.

            I agree Trump might give Israel a free hand vs the Palestinians but he does want a Saudi-Israel deal so that might temper his Zionist impulses.  I am not so sure about Iran.

                Regarding Iran, the Pentagon likely will let Trump know that a war with Iran isn’t a choice anymore. Iran can hit back too hard. Effectively, we’d lose. Trump doesn’t like to lose.
Trump knows how to make deals where he wins and avoids deals where he could lose – and potentially lose very badly. A war with Iran very likely could result in $120 oil and/or a US Navy ship or two burning at sea after being hit by Iranian missiles.

            Agree. I suspected that Trump would be allow a fair fight to win in the aftermath of Oct. 7 and the Left’s reaction to Israel’s attempted ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians.The Jewish elite saw that they couldn’t trust the Left. Sure, they control the Left, but they had to watch their minions too carefully. The GOP and Trump, on the other hand, could be trusted completely to be 100% pro-IsraelThat said, I also suspect that the Pentagon is going to have a talk with Trump about our capabilities, Iran’s capabilities and how things might not go so well if we try to attack Iran. A larger Middle East war may not happen, not because Trump doesn’t want to do Israel’s bidding but because he simply can’t.

                Perhaps the better discussion we should be making—here at least—is the desired result for attacking Iran.  I’m pretty certain that’s the discussion being had by the Pentagon with the WH—or will be.
Near as I can see, there is nothing to be obtained through attacking Iran since we cannot occupy it, nor even gotête-à-têtewith ground troops.  Whenever a country is attacked, it hardens and unite the populace so it would seem regime change from Mulla’s is off the table.
Not an analysis by any measure, just seems we’ve been through this before,

                    What’s different now is Iran’s air defense capabilities (thanks to Russia) and its offensive missile capabilities.The US doesn’t have better hardware than the Israelis and the Israeli attack on Iran recently was a disaster. Their/our stealth bombers were locked on by anti-air missiles causing the Israelis to fire their missiles outside of Iranian territory, making them mostly harmless.The remaining waves of bombers had to turn around.The US could only launch a long-range missile attack against Iran, but Iran can launch their own missiles against US ships in the region, meaning the US Navy would need to withdraw, a huge defeat. Iran could also attack US military installations in the region. Again, a huge defeat.The Pentagon knows this, and they’ll tell Trump.Netanyahu can demand all he wants. If the US can’t deliver, it doesn’t matter. The only way that we could defeat Iran (and even that probably would fail) is to launch a full-out Desert Storm type war, i.e., mobilizing our entire military for a ground and air assault that would last months and cost a lot of lives.There is zero chance the US would do that.Iran is too strong for the US to push around easily. If we punch, they will punch back. The US can no longer engage in these costless air attacks on countries like it has done so many times. Now, we have to calculate the cost of the punch back, and it’s just not worth it.

Did you answer the above question?  I can’t see it.  All you’ve listed are the dangers of attack wrt losses and failure.  These exist in any military undertaking, but the worth of the undertaking must be weighed against the potential benefit.
So the question remains, what is the benefit—to us, not Israel—of American attacking Iran?  In short, what will constitute “victory”?

            Here is a dirty little secret of modern European history. Most of the European national ruling classes didn’t disagree with Hitler and the Nazis that there was a Jewish problem. They disagreed with Hitler and the Nazis over their solution to the Jewish problem.The pre-WW2 European ruling class solution, American elites included, was to keep their heads immersed in great piles of money and feast, ignoring the responsibility of stewardship over their civilizations. So Hitler comes along and says “You frakkers aren’t going to do anything, well, I AM!” They were horrified. I think, not they would ever have admitted it in public, that they knew that their incompetence and misrule were, if not to blame, at least greatly facilitative of the disaster that WW2 was for European civilization.So when the Zionist movement took off, and by that I mean by actually getting support of Jews willing to move to a newly created Israel, European ruling classes were very supportive. Typical of merchant mentality, they were thinking that the problem would go away with the least expense to themselves. They were, of course, wrong. We got the worst of both worlds: problems like Rothschild’s remaining in France and Britain (and eventually conquering them through legalized bribery and fake democracy just like Weimerica) and the burden of an Israeli state seen as an appendage of the West crystallizing hostility of the entire world against us. If it is an appendage of the West, it is a cyst we wish we could ignore, not a weapon-carrying hand doing our bidding.The American interest point-of-view is that we know damn well that if Israel is destroyed all those Jews are going to end up here in America. WE DO NOT WANT THEM. We have had our fill of Goldmans, Schumers, Pritzkers, Raskins, and so on and so forth. We don’t 100,000+ more, which is what we will get if we import 6 million Israelis.A rational American policy, which I hope Pres. Trump will pursue, would see us support Israeli DEFENSE, but absolutely crush this Eretz Yisrael lunacy of conquest from Antioch to Cairo. So, yeah, many of us support Zionism to the extent we wish all Zionists were in Zion, and not in our country. What Pres. Trump says during campaigns and what he actually does may be two very different things. Disingenuity is par for the course in any and every duh-mock-racy. I expect he already has his strategy mapped out, and we will find out out soon enough what it is, and therefore be able to determine exactly what kind of ‘Zionist’ he is.

            Trump is pro-Israel (as is all but maybe 3-4 elected officials in the entire United States) but he is not pro-war. He has already been president, and was the first in a very long time to NOT start any new wars.
In fact, he is probably the president LEAST likely to start a war with Iran that we have had for the last half century or more.
Nobody is giving Netanyahu a free hand. Even his own citizens are growing tired of his non-stop warmongering.

            The way it feels is that the neocons made Trump a deal and the cheat machine was turned down.   Trump will support anything Netanyahu wants to do.   The trouble is Israel is not going to prevail regards Iran without U.S. Boots on the ground.   Israel wants us to take out Iran.   That will not be so easy.   In fact given the actual status of the U.S. military it is likely impossible at this point.
If Trump implements a draft watch his support drop like a rock.

We had two things going for us at that time. 1) a predominated White population, 2) a fairly healthy population—and maybe, 3) a generally “gang-ho” population used to/accepting of drafting canon fodder for wars overseas.

        More on topic, the excessive waiting period between Presidents is odd.
I believe it is an oversight on the part of the Founders. All of the Founders were moral, high-trust, well-reasonrd people who had bonded through their prevails during the Revolution. Those bonds were ironclad because their options were, “win or die.”
Because of the bonds they forged, I believe that the Founders simply couldn’t imagine a time as polarized as ours, with low trust between Presidential factions that would intentionally sabotage each other.

            It was a function of the travel times and communication delays of the day. Even in original 13-state format, the US was a very long country — people traveling from as far away as New Hampshire and Georgia, shuttling messages and mail back and forth, turnaround time was days long. It took time to put an administration together. It would be completely sensible to have an amendment to move the inauguration day to late November.

                This. Also, it was even slower then due to travel and communication to count and certify votes.

            In the time of the Founders, there was a concept of “honor”.  Indeed, men fought duals over insults to their honor.  One’s word was one’s bond so to say.  In any event, a person considered dishonorable was shunned and not allowed into “the club” of high status society.Sounds quaint in our day and age.As far as the wait between assuming office and election, it was even longer in those days as there was no “mass transit” and communications were via currier on horseback.”The time between the presidential election and the inauguration was shortened with the ratification of the 20th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1933. Before this amendment, presidents were inaugurated on March 4, four months after the November election. The 20th Amendment moved Inauguration Day to January 20, significantly reducing the transition period to about two and a half months.”

            One should remember that the Constitution was ratified in the 1780s, when transportation and communications were much slower.  The votes had to be counted and then the electors notified and the trips arranged to Washington DC to vote.  And all this in November and December at a time when the planet was just coming out of the Little Ice Age.  Originally, the inauguration was in March, not January, so an outgoing administration had almost two more months in office.

            News of events in their era traveled at the speed of horses, on roads which were execrable. It took a while for tabulated election results to reach Washington, where they were certified. Same for presidents-elect when they journeyed to take up their posts.

        Unlike Napoleon, Trump won his Waterloo and did it in fine style.
The green hairs across the hall from me were REEE-ing last night.
Reading up on Grover Cleveland, there are some interesting parallels between him and Trump.
The most amusing coincidence is that Cleveland also married a much younger, very attractive wife. He was 47, which is also the number of Trump’s upcoming term.

            Trump is now 47th to take the office, but remains the 45th person to be President as was decided with Cleveland:
”Due to this non-consecutive service, Cleveland is counted as both the 22nd and 24th president, while the total number of individual people who have served as president remains one less than the total number of presidencies.”

        The primary play for the Deep State now is to detonate the debt bomb and blame the aftermath on Trump and the Rino Congress. They would have preferred Kamala and WW3, but they’ll settle for rule by liberal judges and undermining Trump at every turn. Trump is going to have to learn to fight dirty if he wants to avoid a repeat of his first term. Does he have it in him? we’ll know withing the first 100 days.

        This would require a situation for which there is no evidence — to wit, Liberals’ ability to learn anything — but maybe, just maybe, they’re not being so insane this time because eventheyare starting to figure out what happened in 2020:

Nope. It started with Nixon and given Trump’s close association with Nixon and Nixon staffers like Roger Stone and Roy Cohn, I often wonder if Trump isn’t Nixon’s revenge.

        I’m of two minds on thisi think the crazies are fairly confident that trump will be taken out.  From my view, the stuff he is proposing, such as abolishing departments and streamlining the bureaucracy and doing away with the income tax, these are radical ideas.   whether he is just trying to set the bar high for future negations or not.  Didn’t JFK have radical ideas too that would never be allowed to come to fruition?and second is the now common idea that the powerful Jews let him win and are instructing their minions in the press and so forth to keep quiet because they need Trump to give Bibi the green light to “finish the job”One thing I am not alone on, at least in perusing twitter / X, is that many trump supporters are sensing in this eerie calm the precursor to something big, such as an assassination.does anyone here also get the sense that Trump isn’t long for this earth?  I am having a hard time imagining him in office for four years.  I just sense that something bad is on the horizon.  But maybe that is part of the psychological warfare we have all been subject to having its effect on me.

            It’s crossed my mind that the GAE will take Trump out.  But he is not in JFK territory yet.  Kennedy told the N.Y. press club that D.C. was a an anti-American, masonic cryptocracy.  (Which is was, and is.)  JFK and Bobby wanted to disband the CIA, for starters.  That doomed him.

        It occurs to me that one reason the mutants have been relatively quiet is because they are genuinely frightened and do not want to incur wrath by drawing attention to themselves. The Trumpslide hit these people like a thunderbolt and cowed them. And the reason that is the case is because Trump’s victory is being interpreted as an expression of waxing white rage. The various diverse and perverse fear that we have finally had it up to here. We’re sick to death of them and their antics and are on the verge of rising up and taking very real and concrete action against them.If that is what they’re thinking, they’re almost certainly wrong of course. Leftists always overestimate the punitive potential of whites. But that misgauging doesn’t nullify the reality of the fear that has rendered them docile, at least for the time being.

                They’re not particularly creative people (despite their insistences to the contrary), and, as it has been pointed out, they lack 2nd order thinking. It seems that their “driving spirit” (narrative) has abandoned them. Females and betas cannot lead, and they are – for the time being, anyway – hanging in the breeze. Let’s just hope the breeze picks up to Gale Force.I was on the street in Red Hook, Brooklyn yesterday;  they know who I am as surely as ungulate knows the tiger, and they averted their eyes in fear, the fear they live in absent their “guiding spirit.”

        I think we are at the point where the elite regime’s ideological echo chamber is harming them. For example, they claimed this was a toss up election when in reality the closest analog in recent memory was 2008. At no point in 2008 did the polls and media not point towards the coronation of Hopey Changey. There was no way that they didn’t see these results in the data and polls. They just refused to talk about it and lied. They think they can conjure reality if they repeat it enough. So Election Day comes and they are shocked at an outcome that was easily predictable and was predicted by people like Z. If they had the ability to step outside and realize Biden was cooked years ago and Kamala is an idiot, they could have made sensible changes. But they can’t do that.ostensibly the solution to this is simple, stop demonizing your opponents and step outside the bubble. But this is also the one thing they seemingly cannot do as their entire worldview is predicated on them being on the right side of history and us standing in the way. This really is the core of leftism and why, sadly, these experiments always end up with violent purges and mass killings. If the guy standing between you and the workers paradise refuses to change his mind, what other options do you have?

        A small sample of friend/family anecdotal evidence is that TDS is still alive and people are still in a hysteria. Of course, these people are the blades of wheat that blow in the wind. If the wind blew the other way they would follow. As you say, what the leaders of the grifts do is another thing. They are not going away.The Trump speech was the usual economy economy economy. The economy doing well will unite us is his view. Same old mercantilist sentiment. With full bellies the plebs won’t fight. But what about the system that fills bellies of one group by taking from another?Time will tell. All energy must be spent working on what comes next.

        “They will be back, so the question is in what form will they return?”Z’s point here is a bullseye. The communists were revolting in many places in Europe after WW1. Russia had already been conquered, the JudeoBolshevik (Trotsky) led Red Army was poised to conquer Poland and fully expected to sweep through Europe all the way to Lisbon assisted by communist uprising in Germany and elsewhere.However, the European working classes didn’t buy in. The Poles fought bitterly, intelligently, and successfully, and uprisings farther West failed. This was a huge psychological blow to communist luminaries. They basically carried out a multi-year movement-wide after-action-analysis to figure out where they went wrong and where to go next. They correctly blamed their failure on the European (white) working class and I believe it is the origin of the genocidal anti-white lunacy we see in our era.We are at the beginnings of a another communist movement-wide after-action-analysis. Who will they blame? (it sure as hell isn’t going to be themselves or their lunatic ideology) What will they change about their movement, its organization and composition, and goals real and professed?I think one lesson that they will draw, unless they are even more retarded than I assess, is that in the end it is the oligarchy, not them, who makes the final decisions. They got too big for their britches. Underestimating the oligarchy while in alliance with them (against nationalism) is not a mistake that their ideological forebears a century ago would have made. Pres. Trump had such an easy time because the oligarchy pulled the plug on the vote fraud. Yes, there was still fraud but I suspect most of it lower level operatives refusing orders to stand down. I expect that the oligarchy will have no problem with MAGA unwittingly assisting the oligarchy by hunting the uncompliant fraudsters down and giving them long prison sentences so that in the future the rest will know the consequences for not following orders. The oligarchy will NOT have their back.When the antics of the crazies threaten imperial rent-seeking operations, the crazies become no longer useful as a weapon against nationalists and get tossed under the bus. Expect some return to movement roots as opposition to oligarchy. (1)A second lesson I hope they learn, and fully expect that they will not, is that it is not just European nations who don’t want to be ruled over by them, but all nations. No one wants to be ruled over by these degenerate lunatics. Most of the diversity will go along with them on a tactical basis when there is loot in it for them, but not the the extent of having their own identities and cultures destroyed.This broad rejection cuts to the heart of their personal identities. “We are the vanguard of the proletariat, and the proletariat doesn’t like us.” The contortions they put themselves through to answer this dilemma without blaming themselves will be high dark humor.(1) A doctor has two primary functions, diagnosis and prescription. Diagnosis is assessment of what is wrong. Prescription, in the pre-bigPharma meaning, is treatment plan to fix what has been assessed as being wrong. The left has imo a fair amount of overlap with the right when it comes to socioeconopolitical diagnosis. It is in prescription that the divergence becomes irreconcilable. A leftist diagnostic (re)recognition that oligarchy is an essential ingredient of the problem civilization faces would be of utility.

        It’s revisionist history to say everybody saw through the Russia hoax from the beginning. I can speak to this from the perspective of a relative normie who was brought over the great divide to the DR by this very thing. Perhaps the DR recognized it as such from the beginning, I wouldn’t really know, but I can tell you most people were taken in by it to some degree or another, or were at least open to the possibility of it being true, and it’s what tilted the 2018 midterms in favor of the Ds. It wasn’t until after Mueller’s subsequent dud in front of congress that the great mass of normies really began to question.Personally, when the Russia hoax story dropped in a big way right after the 2016 election, I recognized it as a coup attempt, what else could it be, but it took until sometime in the spring of 2017 before I was sure it was a fairy tale. It seemed incredible that the MSM, FBI, CIA, Capitol Hill, DOJ, large numbers of people, were all acting in orchestrated concert to propagate something that was pure fiction. Yet they were. And my view of the world has never been the same since.

            I really never thought much about the Russia hoax one way or another. Of course I’m enough of a Machiavellian to not care how Trump got into power the first time anyway. The thing about the “Russian collusion” idea was just how preposterous and disingenuous the pearl clutching over it was. I mean here are people living in a nation that meddles to an extreme degree in the politics of probablyeverynation on earth, including overthrowing governments (Ukraine 2014) and assassinating leaders. Yet, they’re shocked, shocked, that foreign countries are trying to influence our elections? Of course a lot of the outrage was fake we can safely assume.

        “There are plenty of other places to look, but the reason it feels like there is an eerie calm over the battlefield is everyone expected the orcs to keep fighting, despite the results of the election. Instead, they have retreated over the hill and are murmuring amongst themselves. The thing to accept is they never quit. They will be back, so the question is in what form will they return? What path back to perfidy will they take in the coming months to continue the fight?”To extend the Lord of the Rings battle metaphor a bit.  Trump’s 2016 victory was like the Battle of Helm’s deep, a great triumph, but only the first of many pitched battles.  The 2020 election and Biden’s win was analogous to Sauron’s forces striking back at Osgiliath, seizing the ruins of Gondor’s former capital, and preparing for Mordor’s final onslaught, which would sweep all before the black tide.  2024 is akin to the Battle of Minas Tirith, which was expected to be Sauron’s final offensive against the Men of the West, which would break the back of the last power that could put up any real resistance to the Dark Lord’s might.  The Battle of Minas Tirith proved to be a decisive victory for Gondor but did not end Sauron’s power.  The Dark Lord still commanded vast armies at the ready in Mordor.

        The quiet does not surprise me. The Left will murder you without hesitation, but if you do punch back it often curls into the fetal position and whimpers. It was punched Tuesday.Also, I suspect the plan is to hold fire and then resist any and all attempts at deporting the millions the Left allowed to flow into the country. It wouldn’t surprise me if the thinking all along was to take the hit, protect the border jumpers afterwards, and then move to legalize them once back in office. Of course, the leftwing foot soldiers are too emotive to have participated in such a thing. Their handlers, though, are cold and calculating.The problem is the corrupt and cowardly Republicans, particularly in the Senate. Although deportations would be wildly popular and resistance to them would damage the Democrat opposition, fossilized GOP humps like McConnell in the Senate are still terrified by the crippled propaganda organs as well as bribed by the open borders/corporate fanatics. No one is hoping harder that the Democrats prevail in the ongoing counts of the Arizona and Nevada Senate races than McConnell and that ilk. A seat or two more and the ouster of his lieutenants (one of whom would be leader), along with support of deportations, might be possible.As for Project Ukraine, that’s done. Maybe a little more grift allowed before the final curtain falls should be allowed in exchange for deportations?

        “The people we call the Left” is a mouthful.  Why not just call them the American Left and be done with it.  Treat the word Left like the metric system.  It means something else in Europe and classically defined.  In America, it distills down to “Government”.Anyway, best way to look at what comes next is through the lens of available weapons, measures, and countermeasures.  The loss of the NPV has put them on their heels because it neuters two of their primary weapons:Media narrative (“electoral college must go!”)Shock troop deployment (riots)Two weapons off the table.  There are more:Youth involvement.  Millennials are getting OLD.  They have jobs and families. They cannot be counted on as soldiers.  Gen Z voted for Trump by 10%+ margins.  That is SHOCKING.  It reverses the polarity and removes millions of potential shock troops from the battlefield.Riots/violence.Police have an ally in Trump who will pardon police who crack heads.  Did you notice how fast that riot in Seattle got smashed by the local cops?  That crap is not going to play and Trump will not be able to be intimidated by negative media.Media saturation attacks / shock and awe gaslighting.  The election is an absolutely, unqualified rejection of what we saw in Aug/Sep.  Everyone knows that the media was straight-up lying to them.  CBS went so far as to substitute answers from different questions to replace yet another famous Harris word salad.  The fascism stuff was limp and nobody cared or believed it.  Even right up to election day with that fake Iowa poll and claims that Harris was up in swing states that Trump won by 3-4-5%.  All lies.Use of the courts: SCOTUS eliminated this as an attack vector against Trump 47 through their “unitary executive” ruling.  There will be no DOJ/FBI investigations of Trump or his staff. There will be no special counsels.  DOJ is already working to drop the J6 case.  Watch for New York officials (crazy as they are) to drop their various cases, too.  In New York, they risk becoming targets of criminal probes.  There are criminal statutes that prohibit what they were trying to do to Trump.  Finally, NONE OF IT WORKED.  All of these lawsuits and indictments had one and only one purpose.  And they all failed. They likely contributed to Trump’s NPV win.Lawfare: a subset of the above.  The entire Lawfare project failed.  All of those involved are now going to become targets of the Trump DOJ and new AG.Use of Congress:  Lost the Senate.  Most likely lost the House.  There will be no investigations of Trump.  He also now has a mandate and 2 years of open-field running.  Both chambers will be able to help Trump prosecute Lawfare and DOJ/FBI officials because – as Trump learned personally – they can pierce attorney-client privilege.  Sauce for the goose.Use of the Bureaucracy / #resistance:  See SCOTUS “unitary executive” ruling.  Also, Trump is going to be firing lots and lots and lots of bureaucrats.  Basically, anybody who poses a threat will be fired.Use of “Security Classifications”.  DOJ/NSD will be disbanded or subjected to massive oversight.  The IC and DOJ/FBI can no longer hide behind security classifications while threatening Trump with prosecution if he declassifies something they don’t like.  Also, we’re going to see massive levels of declassification which is going to shine a lot of unwanted light on the rats.NGOs.  These are used heavily to accomplish things the government wants like shipping illegals across the border.  All of those NGOs are now in legal jeopardy.  As the Trump Admin scrutinizes them, their funding will dry up, taking them off the battlefield.  If Trump follows through on massive deportations, the NGOs will be targeted to prevent the illegals from returning.  Watch for Trump to actually enlist the NGOs to support re-integration of illegals back into their countries of origin.Obama.  Just…lol.  He had no affect on anything, and is the guy who pushed Harris on the Democrat Party.  He is in big trouble.Now ask yourself, what weapons do they have left?That’s why there hasn’t been any blowback.  There are almost no weapons remaining.Save one: assassination.I think there will be more attempts.  Fortunately, Trump no longer needs to campaign or put himself in more dangerous situations.  The biggest threat right now is the “insider threat”…people who work in the government with access and motive.It might take the #resistance a year or more to come up with effective new weapons and counter-countermeasures.

        there is no reason to think their relative quiet this time is a sign that they are about to fold up their tents and get jobs down at the local Home Depot…These people are sociopaths, so no one should be optimisticI’m not sure we’re talking about the same group of people. If I were Orange Hitler I would focus on “buying out” the sociopaths in the inner elite and then encouraging, well forcing, the outer party scum to do the Hope Depot thing. A lot of the problem of our society is that both the public and private sector are full of wammen and diversity who are basically just paid to take up space, get fat, and screech slogans on cue. If you co-opt the intelligent sociopaths who give them their orders they will scatter. Perhaps OMB can secretly fund some nice suicide cults for them to join. I hear there’s a bright comet on its way…

        Not that they wanted it, but Trump’s victory offers the Democrats some opportunities, in a silver lining sort of way. DEI won’t be thrown under the bus, but it will have to go to the back of the bus (heh). Same with the worst of the tranny shit, although the GOP is already showcasing “sane” trannies like Jenner. Still, just keeping them out of women’s sports will turn down the heat, and diffuse the politics somewhat.Republicans will carry Israel’s water, so the Democrats cans hand wring over Palestine all they like, at least until 2028. That may cause problems for Josh Shapiro, but he may be counting on a peace deal after Iranian regime change to ameliorate that.Finally, Trump’s victory over a painfully unqualified black(ish) woman may allow Democrats to at last make the pivot to Latinos, where they clearly have some work to do. Bad optics over deportations may help with that. The death of “demography is destiny” is being greatly exaggerated, and if the Democrats are willing to be patient, nature will do their work for them.

        So far, the AOC / Obama led agitation to have people riot is not happening. Even the possible rioters have to buy groceries. Inflation per the FT’s John Burns-Murdoch is something EVERY ordinary person around the globe really hates. This situation could change, but there is little appetite for rioting right now. Biden gave a sh!t eating grin speech where he praised himself and promised a peaceful transition to Trump.Biden seems delighted that Obama/Harris lost to Trump. Which was utterly predictable.The DOJ is winding down the prosecutions of Trump. The wild card is the NYS Judge Meacham who theoretically could later this month sentence Trump immediately to Rikers. And Harris simply refusing to certify Trump as the winner, and certify herself.My guess is that the Regime will lean on NY State and Georgia for action, if they want. But there will be very much push back by Trump’s elite allies who don’t want the results of that action, and want Trump to clean up Biden / Obama’s mess.The outlier of course is something by Obama and his allied Generals — think Alberto Fujimori crossed with Pinochet. There would not be much support for that given the popular vote and a swing of important elites to Trump who expect cleanup on Aisle 7.

As is Hochul, Bragg, James, that DOJ lawyer who joined the prosecution, etc.

            I expected several RINOs to switch parties if the election was close and violence followed “for the good of the country…unity…blah blah blah”.
Trump won so big that option won’t fly.  They’ll work to undermine him.
Trump needs to make sure Thune isn’t majority leader.

        I think you are right Z that this is a pause in the fighting. The Left and the Dems (but I repeat myself) have overrun their “supply lines” and save for the craziest of the crazy have run far ahead of their voters. I suspect they’ll fall back and mute the craziest of their rhetoric and “let the lines stabilize” in an attempt to win back some of their traditional voting blocks.That however does not mean they’ll completely abandon their targets and goals. They’ll slink back and bide their time. Unfortunately, unlike your view yesterday I think this means Obama will return to try to be kingmaker again. Yes his last two projects (Biden and Harris) were disasters, but he has money, lots of it, and that’s enough.

        It looks like its Lawfare. Fani Willis is poised to resume the trial and convict Trump. Which would in turn require Trump to have an indictment against Obama, the guy who is almost certainly “managing” though not day-to-day running that clown show. The stuff about releasing the Diddy and Epstein tapes is probably also brushback pitching against Obama.

The state-level persecutions exist because Biden’s DOJ allows it.  That protection is going away.

        My gut tells me they will scramble to see who will accept their apology BJ, as not to be fully ousted from their lucrative positions. They know the momentum is on the other side now, so to survive they will submit partially. We have to remember that they are cheap whores and as such will sell out to the dominant force. As Z man once mentioned a few posts ago, ‘they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity’. ( I think the quote was related to project Ukraine, but nevertheless I think it  applies here as well ). Of course, the feminized managerial system might attempt something far more stupid none of us can imagine, but they are just a bunch of pansies so I guess we’ll see.

        What path will they take? My best guess is that they’ll stave off the coming economic debacle until Trump has been in office long enough that people will blame him for it. However, I’m not ruling out a drone strike on the inauguration.

They were retargeted at Netanyahu’s coup against the supreme court in Israel. Those “pro-Palestinian protesters” didn’t come from nowhere. They were Antifa &amp; friends, following their masters’ change of priorities.

        The liberal elites like confirmation from the people. They like to be cheered on. America is a perennial popularity contest, so it’s public figures like to bathe in the warm whisky fumes of approval. Situated between the coziness of TV and the fantasyland of movies, the average liberal fumbles a bit without public approval. This is a good part of the reason they try so hard to master the media. The liberal, born a loser in high school, wants to be one of the cool kids now. That explains their deafening silence vis-a-vis Trump. They have been rebuffed.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
