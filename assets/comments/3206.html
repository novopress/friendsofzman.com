        But school board member Michael Durso said that the schools effectively close for a religious reason: the schools had high absenteeism because of a religious holiday in the community.Next year the school board should do a survey and determine how many students are absent for religious reasons on a given Muslim holy day.  If there is high absenteeism, as there is on Christian and Jewish high holy days, the board can act to close the schools on that day in following years. However, if only a few students are absent, the board must be consistent and apply the rule that is in place by declaring that day a regular school day.  At its discretion, the board could instead give Muslim students an excused absence for that day.

        Another reason Leftists align with the Moslems is because they are fellow travelers in the quest to undermine Western values, which eventually leads to the destruction of Western Civilization. The Muslim Brotherhood has as one of its stated goals, the destruction of Western civilization from within. Leftists and Moslems both espouse a supremacist ideology where conformity is prized and expected, and questioning and dissent is not welcome.While some people are distracted by the “adjustment” of the school calendar to suit the Moslems in Maryland, skirmishes like this are occurring all over the country. And nearly every time, the Moslems get what they want: our capitulation. Look at what will be occurring in Washington today. The Washington National Cathedral will be “hosting” a Moslem prayer service. This is not some random Moslem prayer for a show of inclusiveness, but a Moslem prayer service. Few people understand that when the imman issues a call to prayer, that makes the church into a mosque in the eyes of the Moslems. They won’t claim it now, but one day if they ever have the numbers they will. In our nation’s Capitol, at the very place the funerals of presidents are held. How in-your-face is that?

        The Left will love Islam until the Moslems reach a critical mass of population, but by that time it will be almost too late. Look at what is happening in Europe. Moslems are 8% of the population in France, roughly 5-6% in other European countries like Germany, Austria, Great Britain, 4% in Denmark. These sound like low percentages, but they are not. There are many “no-go” areas in France, where not only non-Moslems do not dare go, but neither do the police. People, like Geert Wilders of Denmark, who dare speak the truth about Islam, are arrested and tried for hate speech. Children and teen girls were raped and/or sexually abused by Pakistani Moslems in Rotherdam, England while the local authorities turned a blind eye. Everywhere Moslems immigrate, destruction of one kind or other is sure to follow.There have been signs lately that the long-sleeping denizens of Europe are waking up, and I hope it is not too late for them. The longer they wait, the fewer options they have. Europe managed to pull itself together in 1683 when an alliance of Christians, led by Polish King Jan Sobieski, held off and defeated the Moslem hordes at the Gates of Vienna. I’m wondering if there are enough Christians left in Europe to pull off something similar.As for our country, No More Moslems. Approximately 2-3%  of our population is Moslem, and already at just this small amount, we are starting to see Moslems agitate for their “rights”. Every time we capitulate to them, they are stronger for it. They will use our western values and pluralistic society, which they despise except when they use them against us, to further their cause. If we can keep them to that 2%, we stand a better chance at repelling the “invaders” than Europe.Islam is incompatible with Western Civilization. Time for some push-back.

        The Marylanders can’t bring themselves to face the issue head on, so they try to evade it by renaming the holidays.To face the issue squarely they need to say to the Muslims:1 – Islam presents itself as a religion, but it functions as an invasive political tyranny.2 – Islam never seeks functional equality, it always seeks domination.3 – We are sensitive to the needs of the American culture, And Islam is fundamentally incompatible with it.Therefore, we will never give Islam parity with the Christian and Jewish religions in this country.Go home and practice Your Islam there. If home is down the street, fine, we won’t stop you. If you want more recognition than that, then it is up to you to choose another country.—I know there are many lovely Muslim people, and some of them may be citizens here in the US. However, we should do everything we humanely can to stamp out organized Islam here in America.

The left doesn’t love Islam. They hate normal Americans. If Islam and normal Americans were friends, the left would instantly discover that they had always hated Islam. Note that when they do condemn anything a Muslim does, they do it by likening him to the REAL terrorist Neanderthals: Normal Americans.

        I wonder if the GOP presented itself as the “Party of Islam” if the left would have a knee jerk reaction to go to war against Muslims. Would they be simple enough to fall for that?

        Thank goodness the leftoids don’t try to build a church in Saudi Arabia or Iran, as that is strictly against the law in those god-forsaken places. Mind you, as useful idiots the leftoids wouldn’t want to build a church any place other than make a temple to their own unpleasant ambitions and shifty ‘heroes.’Islam indeed doesn’t play well with anyone else but that is the whole point. In the muslim ideal there is nothing else in the world by the time they have finished. Parity? That would be all men worshipping in one direction and all women in full-length bags.

        SO…set your keyword recognition algorithm to “Truman”, and the impending bullet point phrases in the upcoming “script” involving Iranian Nuclear“negotiations” by the Executive Branch, WITHOUT the expertise of any “high ranking career military” that MAY have survived forced retirement, or “lateral promotion”, in the last six years.Look for incredulous couplings with “un-American” in the same paragraphs as “peaceful energy and medical”, as well as “Iran’s Rights”.
