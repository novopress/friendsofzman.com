        I wish I shared your confidence that we’ve finally seen the end of progressivism, but I doubt it. There will be progressives as long as there are perverts, parasites and spiteful mutants, and we’ve got a lot of them. And sadly, they aren’t moving to Canada as promised.

            Watch Trump’s speech to congress this evening. There will be interruptions. Progressivism is definitely not dead.

                Perhaps at some point we should draw a distinction between progressivism and the childish narcissism it has either spawned or enabled. All ideologies, sooner or later, to some degree or another, get skinsuited by powerful interests with their own agendas. However, progressivism was also skinsuited by degenerates with no agenda other than their own depravity. Which lately has become a stand in for “freedom.” Throwing tantrums is part of that schtick, but it’s not really “progressive.”

                    I’m not sure Progressivism (or, as I prefer to call it, Progressive Liberalism) was ever not shouty and narcissistic. There have been sober center-left Liberal types like Mike Gravel and Tulsi Gabbard, and old class warriors like Tony Benn, but when I think of “progressive” I think of those ugly women in the early 20th century who tried to take our alcohol away.

                        Modern hair dyes, piercing guns, junk food, and electric trimmers have given those women new ways to express their inner ugliness outwardly. In a way it’s better now because you won’t mistake them for human beings.

                    Jeffrey Zoar:“childish narcissism… Throwing tantrums…“The Frankfurt School certainly knew what it was doing when it ripped the lid off of Pandora’s Box, via the “Feminism” psy-op.For at-risk personalities, apparently Cluster-B is one hell of a thrilling ride.I don’t see how we lock up Cluster-B back into Pandora’s Box without having to suffer through something akin to a literal thermonukular war.I’m at the point now where the horror of Cluster-B is dominating an yuge percentage of my daytime musing and a disturbingly large portion of my nighttime dreams.We either “spay” Cluster-B, or it’s gonna “neuter” our entire species.Between the V@xxpocalypse &amp; the fury of Cluster-B, it’s getting rather difficult to imagine Our Folk limping across the finish line and into the 22nd Century.I hope &amp; pray that we figure out some way to survive.

That Culture is way the hell UPSTREAM from any possible Politicks.
That if you lose your Culture, your people vanish into extinction.

            As long as the JQ is alive and well, we’ll continue to have Progressivism in some form or other. It’s a sad, but necessary comment on the way these maniacs think. Most of us can’t/won’t go where this sort of thinking goes. “Perverts, parasites and spiteful mutants” will always be among us, but we cannot allow the Usual Suspects to enlist them. That means shoving these PPSMs back into the closet and locking the door so they can never again be used as political weapons.

                Modern radicals have just modified Marxism a bit. Marx thought of the proletariat as the revolutionary class. Today’s Left is much more interested in mobilizing what he would have called the lumpenproletariat. Petty criminals, the mentally ill, sexual deviants, unmarriageable women, illegal aliens, and the hordes of young stupid people you find around every college today who would never have been admitted until the last 30 years or so; these people are the low grade fuel the modern Left has evolved a way to burn in its demonic engine. Think about the people Kyle Rittenhouse shot. Every one of them was some kind of degenerate.This is also why Blue cities (Portland and San Fran are the templates) are so full of the above mentioned people. Conservatives will sometimes naively ask “couldn’t you guys at least clean the feces off the streets and send the cops to knock down the tent cities?” The power structure in these places needs to have these people on hand. Whenever there’s a danger of reform the political class can gin up a protest or riot to take everyone’s mind off of practical concerns. I still recall the news videos every night when the lunatics tried, ineptly, to burn down Portland’s ICE headquarters in ’20. That went on for like 100 days – great fun, another urban clown show to keep everyone’s mind off the high rents and appalling filth and decay.

            Even if it were dead, we have 10s of millions of foreigners in the country.  It is simply not the same place, because it’s not the same people.  Unless and until they are physically removed, at least most of them, we will never be the same country again.

                We’re NEVER going to be “the same country again.” Such notions have to be put aside; and the loonies are on to something (as they very rarely are) when they allege that we “maybe never were.”The question, then, is “what will we become”?

                    The answer is we will become one of two things: 1) A mishmash of conflicting cultures, and/or 2) A (one) culture that “wins out” and remains predominant—but it won’t be of a Northern European, White Christian ethos.But even that does not paint the correct/total picture as it fails to take fully into account the new average IQ of the population and the myriad problems associated with a mean of 90-92 national IQ. I believe it was Lynn that claimed there were no functional democratic societies with a national IQ below 90-92.The unknowns at this point? Critical “Smart Fraction”, and the effect of AI on those with lower level IQ’s—I don’t expect AI will make up for “stupid”.

                “…we have 10s of millions of foreigners in the country.”This! It’s worse.As of today, officially we have 48.8M foreign born nationals in the US. That’s 14% of the current “official” population. In 1970, it was at 4.7%—its lowest point ever recorded. So in less than 60 years, or a little more than two generations, we’ve tripled the number of foreign born us citizens. These new “citizens” were overwhelmingly non-White, and non-Christian.The rise of Boomers 1946-1964 masked the growing cancer and kept a lid on things to a point—but no longer. By 2040, the majority of Boomers will have passed away—the rest old and invalided and not worth noting in the political landscape.As the saying goes, “you ain’t seen nothing yet!”

Exactly. Current year “progressives” are just deformed freaks looking to rationalize their dysgenic, envious behavior. Progressivism as an actual ideology died out with the failure of the New Deal.

        Zman, the progressives HAVE changed how the people “think about themselves, their neighbors, and the state.”  They were definitely a religious and intellectual movement hitching its wagon to populism, but they welcomed and were subsumed by those they considered their “elder brothers” in faith – the Jews.  America no longer considers itself a settler nation, but a melting-pot immigrant nation.  Instead of a united manifest destiny, we have a multi-racial ‘mosaic’ united in condemning and exterminating White people in order to destroy the bugbear of ‘racism.’  Our neighbors are not those other Whites who support ‘hate,’ they are the Somalis and Ukrainians because we are all citizens of the world and members of the ‘one race, the human race.’  Every White girl has been convinced she’s either a boy, or destined to mate with the duskiest schoolmate she can land.Again, I would be thrilled to be rid of progressivism, but I find this triumphalist tone extraordinarily premature.  Mayhap you’re spending too much time with older advocates who are anxious to declare victory before they shuffle off this mortal coil.  I prefer realism to idealism, and the amorphous ‘left,’ and the desire of some humans to ‘fix’ or reorder human life because ‘they’ know best, is not going to just slink away.  And certain people’s lack of public noise is not indicative of defeat, but private strategizing.

            Premature? Ya think?The courts have not been touched. The unis and colleges? Fully intact and churning out progs and fem-supremacists like it was 1990 forever. The grade schools? Ruled by leftist hags, busily constructing new generations of homos, castrati, proglings and pantsuited superwomen.The military is still pozzed. The corporations openly BRAG that the Ebil Ebil white males need not apply. The Prot churches have been emasculated and conquered for decades. Institutional Feminism is organized and funded to the teeth and has not been budged an inch.  Nor even recognized as an enemy.I could go on. Yes, thumping USAID was lovely. . . but barely a beginning. The enemy is still comfortably lodged and in power everywhere except — perhaps — the Presidency. It ain’t like the Orangster is Baptist John reincarnated; Donald is an Eighties liberal, with empowered daughters no less.The fight hasn’t even begun yet.

                Essentially, the entire Leftist archipelago outside of FedGov remains largely untouched by Trusk’s entirely praiseworthy initiatives. Until the institutions, the corporations, the media and Hollywood are gutted and reformed, Leftism will continue running rampant. Right now, we’re barely scratching the surface.

                    Nothing wrong with celebrating a few minor victories.  But clearly the citizenry doesn’t have what it takes to do what needs doing.
Still too fat ‘n happy, especially the UMC and up. Millions of porcine couch dwellers who are thrilled to hitch their daughters not to men, but to the Fem-Prog Gravy Train that begins in grade school.
A failing economy, crime and invaders everywhere, and streets glutted with throwaway men don’t budge the needle.  America needs a masculine and spiritual revival, or it is toast.

            Amidst all of this “winning”, not a single soul has been held accountable.  Not one arrest, no executions for treason, nothing.  All that’s going to happen without accountability is the left will rig something in four years and put it all back.  Then they will punish Whites even more.  Perhaps outright killing us.  This is why the right is filled with losers.  The right fails to adopt the tactics of its enemies, which is to vanquish its opposition.  To become a vicious attacker with extreme prejudice is the only path to ridding us from this evil.

                Not trying to be a plan truster, but they have to know this. Not just based on logic, but prior events, going back to the very formation of the Deep State. There is no halfway here. The real question is what do they do with their own people who don’t do the job. Kash Patel is already starting to look like a squish, not surprisingly.

                Yep, but it’s too soon to proclaim “Trump failure”. We must hang in there. We must play the long game. Evidence? How many of the observations made here over the years concern the Leftist attempts—and failures—due to over playing their hand. Indeed, it has been perhaps Conservatism’s saving Grace. Let’s not make the same mistake.

What is strongly lacking is not “action” but patience. Spring the trap too early and all the feral hogs escape. Mayhaps the executions will happen, but we have to have all our ducks in a row first.

You might as well not even bother until we can get at least a handful of venues before which to bring them. When is that? Simple. When we can bring them to trial without being immediately freed.

            “Amorphous” is right. The Left are nothing if not shape-shifters. Even if some of their more fevered “beliefs” are now being subjected to some ridicule, so what? These are broken people, without shame or self-awareness, who – to put it as Orwell did – think in slogans and talk in bullets.
I’ve enjoyed Trump’s troll-fest as much as anybody, but if he doesn’t go full Franco on our enemies – fast – then nothing will prevent them from going full Mao on us when their turn comes next.

        It would be nice if we could quit being slaves to ideology.  We need to put our people first not some set of ideas. Institutions, ideas and programs exist to serve our people not the other way around.

            Focus on furthering our people could be construed as a type of ideology. It’s certainly racialism. Not that there’s a thing wrong with that.

Very much this. I’m not sure why our host is so consumed with distancing himself from ideology. All I can think of is that he’s using it as a pejorative through some connotation rather than a strict denotation.

        The HBD crowd is going nuts too. They always claimed to be about genetics and practical when it came to politics. But since the election of Trump the first time they have been increasingly rabid in their support of the managerial state. It started with covid lockdowns and then turned into zealous support for Ukraine. And now Greg Cochran is blasting Elon day and night because of DOGE. You’d think Cochran and Sailer would be excited about diversity being challenged. But no, they both hate Trump too much, I guess because he challenges a system they love. I don’t think these guys were ever on our side.

            I don’t know enough about Cochran, but I’d argue Sailer’s only ever been on his own side – the coalition of the self-identified global intelligentsia.  His HBD was a mile wide and a micrometer thick.  He would wax endlessly about black women’s preoccupation with their unappealing physiognomy, but very carefully avoided ‘noticing’ much of anything about east Asians in America, and Jews in America.

                I put Cochrane in there with Francis Collins as a disappointment and a reminder that even the most cognitive who get some enduring important things correct, also get important thing wrong. No one bats a thousand, but attaching any element of one’s personal identity into any movement shaped by internationalists will lower it greatly.

            The Cochran question has been discussed.  He lost most all credibility during COVID, whereas Z-man rose.  Not entirely different from Sailer.  Nothing detracts from their previous HBD teaching’s and writings however.  To take these two individuals and use them to taint HBD science is painting with too broad a brush. What is it we always say about renowned scientists who leave their area of expertise to dwell/comment in socio-economic areas?  We hate them, but politely ignore them.  So should you.

        i think you are conflating two distinct issues.   the death of ideology *and* a return to normalcy.  the latter doesn’t necessarily follow from the first.  while trump might harken back to 1950s normalcy, very few of the citizenry do.  what comes next IMO is decentralization, and the concomitant ‘splitting’ of large nations into region sized entities.   large size is expensive, and a disadvantage when resources are scarce or exspensive.

        I’ve been tracking the progressive response to Trump and, well, there just isn’t much of it. Even Trump chucking Zelensky out of the WH like Uncle Phil did to Jazz didn’t muster much of a response. Considering the Ukrainian dwarf has been treated like the world’s greatest hero, that is quite surprising. It sureseemslike whatever funding and organization was used to form #TheResistance in 2017 doesn’t really exist anymore, although of course I can’t totally prove it. The fact that Trump’s first move was to shut down USAID of all things also is quite interesting in light of this.So, if I am describing this situation accurately, did progressivism run out of steam years ago and has just spent a decade or more being propped up by the government? I think you could make this argument clearly in Europe, where they have spent 15 years fighting the natural response to their own bad policies and governance. Yet, it seems to be the case here too. of course, the mind reels at the implication of this, and the idea that the entire worldview we have been fed our entire lives is totally fake and government funded.

        It will be interesting to see how the breakup of Social Media, which you’ve written about, into mutually exclusive silos plays into it. The only real bulwark against Ideology in the broad sense is localism — Progressivism took root in the cities, because that’s the only place itcan. If Peak Social Media was, say, 2016, when Trump used it to get elected, now the breakdown of Social Media might ironically encourage localism. Karen can’t hector the entire world on BlueSky, because only fanatics are on BlueSky, so she’ll have to get into NextDoor and do her hectoring “in person.”

            Silicon Valley seems to be trying to create a new ideology: techno-capitalism. Like previous movements, they have attached themselves to the populists to gain power.That explains their flip to Trump in 2024 and them pushing their protege Vance as VP, hoping that he’ll take over in 2028.There could be some good outcomes if they succeed–return to normalcy on social issues and a focus on economic nationalism for example.But they have ‘bigger’ plans too. The worst include moving to a CBDC and full time surveillance of the population, for their ‘safety and convenience’ of course.If we can somehow take the good parts while avoid the techno-tyranny, we’ll be OK. If not, things could get scary.

                A technocracy would delight Elon Musk and his bug men friends at Apple. For the first time in history geeks have an economic purpose — now they’ll have a political one as well.

                    Mardi Gras in Louisiana developed separately from Brazi. (The origins of Mardi Gras in Louisiana are French). Of course, you can still hate it, but it’s not incorporating anything from Brazil.  It was a part of our culture before Louisiana was American.

        As de Tocqueville observed, Americans love creating and joining organizations..the Grange movement, which promoted farming and farmers, nearly elected the orator William Jennings Bryan, on a platform of looser money…Americans have decided that they no longer want to sterilize their children, import foreigners, or spend money they don’t have on foreigners and foreign wars..So what’s next?Martin Armstrong’s AI predicts the US will break up in the 2030s into likeminded groups of States, which might well work better than the current jumble..Maybe the Hartford Conventions were just a couple of centuries before their time….

        Trump said something—just a sort of throwaway line—which in retrospect seems much more than an off-the-cuff bit. Words to the effect of “We have lots of smart young people working for us.” Even though he’s a part of the gerontocracy—and, gasp! a boomer—he recognizes the problem.I think he also recognizes (unlike a lot of us) that, though whites are already in a minority in the youth cohort—they are going to be able to punch far above their weight. Whites always could (on the frontier, in South Africa, wherever you put us) but lot of our people were cooperating with their own demise over the last few decades in the belief we could “heal the wounds of America’s past,” which really weren’t wounds, but just part of the human condition. Slavery isn’t some “peculiar” Southern institution nor is ethnic hatred. It’s just a part of being human.It’s clear, though, that the meme-savvy, computer literate kids like Big Balls are actually alright, and well-equipped for this war, or at least better equipped than the other side. Once you get past their broccoli haircuts and their inability to hold eye contact for more than a couple seconds, you see they’re not all bad. And the human capital on the other side—your Ocasio-Cortezes and Ilhan Omars—will be lucky if they’re not slaves fifty years from now.In Caste Football terms (whatever happened to that site?)

            Trump is just a good businessman. Pick the right tool for the task. The number of X or Booms who have the computer savvy to do what Musk’s Kids are doing are few. That’s why he’s currently running circles around the political class — they are fielding a team wholly unsuited for the current skirmish. Seriously? You are pitting Jamie Raskin or Kirsten Gillibrand against Big Balls?
BTW, this is nothing new. Clinton was also known for bringing kids into the game. Most of your age group will fall for the same scam.

            Yes. And they are all in charge of the companies that are building the weapons and energy systems of the future. Granted they are not on our side of the divide, but that they are us and the future will become more contentious not less.The left is already moving to an anti-oligarch/tycoon rhetoric. The racial genies they have unleashed aren’t coming back into the bottle. I think sooner than we think the Left will be be the final phase of Marxism. Phase I: the evil capitalist. Phase II: The evil white racist Phase III: The evil white racist tycoon capitalist.This is going to force radicalization. I like that our young guys are all building the hardware and software of the future and on its vanguard. The demographic and economic decline are going to bring everything else to a head and The Left is going to go into Phase III Marxism which is really the final unmasking of what it was all along. A mask for ethnic warfare to dispossess and capture the wealth of the class crushed in the revolution.Things are going to be heating up in the next few years.

        ‘but most were homegrown ideas that arose out of American Protestantism and the struggle with secularization’Protestantism is a big word, covering most every Christian that isn’t a Catholic. And that’s a wide field of differences. For example, the elite women that originated Institutional Feminism in America during the mid-nineteenth century largely were rogue Quakers, only nominally Christian. They had very little in common with mainstream, Biblical Protestantism. Yet their anti-Christian movement swept, and finally conquered, most of the Western world. . . with the backing of moneyed elites.The Progressive agenda of the 20th century borrowed far more from the pagan, secular past than from Christianity/Protestantism. Egalite or Equality is NOT a Biblical concept, tho many modern Christians justify Equality by twisting Scripture — which is blatantly hierarchic — to their own power-purposes. Equality between the sexes first was practiced in Babylon, though some elements likely existed at Sumer, also. Not exactly hotbeds of ‘Protestantism’.Open-borders or globalism, again, is a secular scheme. It is specifically outlawed in Scripture, which teaches its opposite, nationalism. (Deut. 32:8)The iconography, architecture, and statuary of developing America was overwhelmingly pagan. Heroes and progenitors are borrowed from classical civilizations like Rome and Greece, along with a smorgasbord of pagan philosophers.Early American elites saw the nation as an extension of those classical forebears and strove to copy and better them. Christianity never was popular with American elites, despite propaganda otherwise. Jefferson, for example, America’s great hero of ‘freedom’ made his loathing of Christ clear on a number of occasions.A freemason — Pierre Charles L’Enfant — designed the District of the Goddess Columbia. A study of its layout is a veritable education in occultism and paganism; nothing Christian about it. And so on.

            One of the delusions of American conservatives was that the USA was founded as a Christian nation. It is true that most 18th century Americans were Christians but the founders leaned toward Deism (Jefferson being the most prominent example), our founding documents do not recognize any religion and the God they mention is the generic god of Deism, not the Christian Trinity.

                They were nonsectarians, but most of them were Christians. Only a couple of them questioned Christianity, like Jefferson and Paine, and Jefferson admired Christ as an ethicist but questioned his divinity.

        The perpetual danger of populist movements is that they will be captured by elites who then use the movements for decidedly unpopulist goals. This happened to 19th century populism and could happen to the 21st century variety too, if the assault on government bureaucracies turns into a license for unchecked corporate plunder. Corporations are no more friends of the little guy than are the federal bureaucracies.

        What we are witnessing is the decline of the free money gravy train. The Fed printed fake fiat money endlessly and corrupt politicians used it to buy votes and stay in office endlessly. This grift has been growing exponentially thereby making a financial collapse inevitable. Trump and his team are now putting on the brakes and the parasites are shrieking in existential terror at the prospect of having to actually work for a living. Ideology-du-jour has always been a mask to hide this grift.

        To finance the Progressive movement, the Elites here built a financial system to sustain America’s global hegemony. Ordered around the dollar as reserve currency, thereby requiring us to run trade/budget deficits, it grew as the Globohomeaux Elite realized they could finance heaven-on-Earth schemes with Eurodollars, debt and swap lines from the Fed. It might have kept working had they not had covid, imported millions of third-world savages and started the Ukraine War. So we face financial and ideological bankruptcy. My guess is that replacing the Dollar will be harder than replacing the ideology.

        Z Man: “Progressivism has had a long run, but for most of the 20th century it served as a bulwark against fascism and then communism.”
It is far more common to hear people say that progressivism was communism at a slower pace. FDR’s progressive administration was full of self-identified communists.

            Actual communists (all seventeen of them) tend to think that progressivism isa liberal anti-revolutionary innovationto defang the proletariat. Concessions to socialist economics prevent worker immiseration, officially favored racial and other identities overwrite class consciousness, etc., and revolution is deferred for as long as the pseudo-leftist pseudo-revolution can keep inventing new current_things.True enough, if you buy a couple commie premises.The basic idea is much more popular among our guys than it is with the self-identified left, who aren’t communists (or anything, really) but regime partisans.That is—they are—Progressivism. They do oppose both Communism and Fascism, who areother types of people, rivals and enemies.

            I interpreted it to mean that Progressivism had muscled its way in to being thought of as The American Way, as opposed to the Old World Way. After all, there wasn’t a whole lot of difference between Progressivism and Fascism in the early 30s. But “progress” is so much easier to sell than “beating people with sticks and cutting off their heads” of fascism’s standard.

        At the end of the Roman Empire you get a huge bureaucracy, government graft,bagaudae(bands of peasant insurgents), civil wars, outsiders in the military and finally leading it, colonization by barbarians, and a provincial nobility that decided it was better to cooperate with the locally settled barbarians and not rely the Roman government which could no longer protect them. These aren’t precisely analogies because the times were much different then, but the broad decay resulted in change. A comical take on this is found in the historical novelFortuna at the Rudder. I hope that we don’t find the shake up as difficult to endure as the late Romans did.

        “It is why it is fair to wonder if what we are seeing and have been seeing for the last few decades is the death of the last remaining ideology, progressivism.”It’s a complex topic. First of all, the post-WW2 elite agenda was to make sure that the Democratic Party expunged most of its really progressive elements. It became a pig with some progressive lipstick on it. From where comes the saying, “The Democratic Party is where progressive movements go to die.” Along with this, the Rockefeller Republicans drifted towards the Democrats in the late ’70s. I think it’s fair to say that the Democrats became Republicans (lite), stripped of any ideology of equitable economic restructuring, and with some ersatz woke ideology added on as a pathetic substitute — identity politics serving in lieu of economic reform. This is the kind of party that produces Obama and the Clintons. There’s more on this in Lance Selfa’s book, “The Democrats: A Critical History.”“Progressivism has had a long run, but for most of the 20th century it served as a bulwark against fascism and then communism.”Another interesting topic. With the collapse of the USSR and its East European vassal states and the concomitant ideology of socialism, the USA and Western Europe could stop making even a pretence of progressivism (or its European versions). In Thatcher’s famous phrase, “There is no alternative” (to dismantling the welfare state and austerity). To repeat myself, what for the “left” filled the vacuum of economic restructuring was woke ideology, all the more shrill and hysterical because it was and is ideologically and morally bankrupt.

        I’ve probably mentioned this before, but when I was researching a family that lived in my state in the early twentieth century, the word “progressive” showed up a fair amount in the local newspapers.  But it was my interpretation that it referred more to technological progress as opposed to social.  Electric lighting, indoor plumbing, automobiles, movies, radios etc.  There’s no doubt progressives, in our lifetime, have gone WAY off the deep end.
