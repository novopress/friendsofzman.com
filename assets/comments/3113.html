        Yep, look at all the restoration shows on Cable now.   The real reason people spend big money restoring ancient rust buckets is that it is the only way you can get away with having fun.    Without the fiction of dealing with a grandfathered vehicle you have to have airbags, pedestrian protection , emissions compliance (not controls but compliance), back up cameras etc.     fun is not on that list.    Just another thing to add to crappy  light bulbs, unusable gas cans, unopenable pill bottles aw shit

        The elites get it that the state is dying and they get that concentration camps and genocide weren’t effective tools. They will not give up power even if they have to turn us into tele-operated robots to hang on. They also get that they only need about one or two billion of us to maintain a technological civilization. That number will go down as productivity increases. Yes, interesting times.

        You are describing the here and now, not the future. The State is currently, or very soon will be, at its apex in terms of size, power and importance. Our own federal State has been slowly growing in size and power since the Civil War. Just about everyone knows we’re broke, but Uncle Sam pretends we are not. How can a government exercise power widely when it is broke? Once the pretending phase is finally over, the government will either collapse or devolve into a much smaller and weaker version of itself. Centralization has had its day in the sun. The coming decentralization will cause tremendous upheaval in our country and most likely other western democracies. We will be living through some very interesting times over the next decade, not boring.
