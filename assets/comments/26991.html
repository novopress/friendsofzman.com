        I read this piece in bewilderment. I can’t understand how the Z-man can be so ignorant of modern warfare, yet address the subject with the same didactic tone as he does everything else. Let’s begin:&gt;the thrown rock is much more effective against men than animals.Why would that be the case? One could easily imagine that it’s actually easier to just throw a rock at a dear than run to it and hit it in the head.&gt;They have a lot of them and they have always been at the top in terms of tank technology.They haven’t. They went for a quantity over quality approach. During the Cold War, their tanks were always one step behind technologically to the west. The only noticeable exception was the T-64, which featured a lot of revolutionary technology.&gt;The terrifying counter is the anti-tank weapon. The concept is pretty simple. You launch a missile at a tank that can penetrate its armor.It’s really unclear here whether Z is narrowing the concept of anti-tank weaponry to modern ATGMs out of crass ignorance or just to keep the textual flow.&gt;The trick is either in hitting the tank from beyond its range or getting close enough to hit it from a blind spot.Up until very recently, “hitting from beyond a tank’s range” was not really in the books for men-operated ATGMs. “Hitting from a blind spot” is not why ATGM and RPG operators get close to tanks. The problem is they are firing relatively slow, for the most part relatively weak projectiles that need to be aimed at the softer bits of a tank. The Javelin, which is arguably a 2000’s era weapon (i.e. recent) is outstanding precisely because of its incredibly high effective range (2,6 km).&gt;The effects of this weapon are clear in Ukraine. Instead of leading with their armor, the Russians have been forced to use artillery and cruise missiles to soften up the line of contact and then use infantry to clear the way for tanks.What you are describing here is the basic combined arms doctrine applied extensively since WWII. The big tank push was indeed very common during WWII (and successfully applied as late as the Gulf War) but also very geography-dependent. The first time tanks got mauled by ATGMs was in the 6th day war, and you might have noticed how armies continued to use them long after 1973. The problem with what the Russians have been doing is that they failed to properly implement doctrines already in place. Anti-tank ambushes are VERY vulnerable to modern air assets and very easy to spot in advance. Most infantry AT teams still need vehicles to move around, after all.&gt;It is cheap, mobile and easy to deploy in a wide range of conditions.The S-400 is ridiculously expensive, even for a long range SAM system (which are expensive stuff). The rockets it fires might be cheaper than an F-16; but most generals would consider 2-3 aircraft losses for the destruction of an S-400 complex a more-than-fair trade. NATO is extremely adept at taking out LRAAM sites; and S-400s aren’t exactly the VW Beatle of weaponry.

        […] Instead of reducing Europe to a moonscape, it will bring about a global depression that will set off… The world will have a food shortage this year due to the halt of agricultural products from Russia. Energy prices are rising, which will amplify the inflation pressure. Like the Great War, we are about to enter a test of wills where all sides try to bring the other to the breaking point economically. Washington is betting you can starve longer than Russians or Chinese. […]

        The Kh-47M2 Kinzhal is most definitely a hypersonic missile.  Hypersonic is defined as Mach 5 or faster, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal has a stated top speed of Mach 10 in its fastest configuration.
Further, the Russian Army has a HEAT missile that is better than Javelin; longer range and faster.  Ukrainian tanks are almost gone, replacements are NOT available.

        This isn’t the salient point of Z’s essay, but I feel the need to counter the premise that the Soviets were in the forefront of tank design and armored warfare. The Soviets had Stalin plotting grand strategy–establishing a sphere of influence once the Nazi regime had been defeated. And the Soviets had sound military strategists such as Zhukov, Konev and Rokossovsky, who could not only match the abilities of the likes of Manstein and Model, butcould prevail in costly but not quite Pyrrhic victories versus the Wehrmacht. (It is often quoted that the Red Army inflicted over 80% of the losses suffered by the Axis forces, without mentioning that it also incurred about 95% of the Allies’ losses in doing so). As for the T-34, its suspension and angled hull design were the brainchild of one J. Walter Christie, whose prototypes were rejected by U.S. Army, Inc. but not by the Soviets. The BT-3 gave way to the T-34, which at the time was well-armed, well-armored and well-shaped ballistically. But… it was also a death trap for its crews. The 76mm-armed models were often crudely manufactured, they had no turret “basket,” and ammunition stowage was potentially hazardous–ammo rather than fuel fires are the most destructive elements for tanks and crews. The 85mm-armed T-34s were a big improvement, but Soviet tank and crew losses were nonetheless. enormous. It is estimated that whereas about 85% of Anglo-American crews survived the war, about 75% of Soviet crews did not (that figure DOES seem a bit high to me). Soviet crews also seemed to like the much-maligned Sherman “emcha” (M4) tank, used largely against Japan’s Kwantung Army in the Far East. The Soviets had trouble upgrading the 1920s-era diesel engine of the T-34, and stole a set of blueprints for the British Chieftain’s 700hp engine, the most unreliable powerplant amongst NATO’s tanks. Oops! I don’t know much about the Armata line of vehicles, but Soviet/Russian AFVs seem to lack the protective features that the West takes for granted. Long story short, the Russians may have good strategic minds, but the historic reliance on massive firepower and the reluctance to use it (a’ la Grozny) may have given those of us in the West the idea that Russia can lose this war and Ukraine can win it–without bothering to define what those criteria may look like.

            You are correct in your assessment of the T-34, but remember:– It was designed to be built by people who had never worked in a factory, much less those who had seen a tank.– It was designed to be maintained by men (and women) who may have never seen an automobile or tractor, much less a tank, before they joined the Army.– They could be churned out faster than the Germans could produce their tanks.– The T-34 and its companion KV-1 stunned the crap out of the German Panzer crews and outclassed their Panzer II, III, and IV tanks. Only better German tactics (Killing your foremost armored warfare generals in a political purge will do that), the mechanical unreliability of the early T-34 and KV-1, and the vaunted Krupp 88 used in anti-tank mode kept the balance to the German side in Barbarossa.The Soviets with the T-34 and the US with the M4 Sherman followed the concept of quantity over quality. Both the T-34 and M4’s had good qualities (Relative reliability [especially compared to later German tanks], easy to produce and maintain, adaptable to  improvements [bigger gun, bigger turret, improved engines, new suspension, etc.], and good speed and maneuverability), that were often offset by shortcomings (Crude build quality, thin armor, being surpassed by newer enemy designs with no replacement in sight).But they were there, they were there in numbers that surpassed the Germans, and the US and Soviets could “make good” their losses either through recovery and repair of damaged vehicles or brand new vehicles off the factory line in the way the Germans could not. And don’t forget the Soviets brought forth the IS/JS (Joseph Stalin, it’s good to be the king, er, General Secretary, you get stuff named after you) series of tanks when the Panthers and Tigers showed up. American, British and Soviet air superiority made being a German tanker a losing proposition later in the war as well.Interestingly the US and USSR diverged in their strategies in tank design and production. The US went for high quality designs which meant fewer, but better tanks while the Soviets stayed with the “Quantity has a quality all its own” approach. (T-72 vs. M1 Abrams)I agree with your closing assessment. Who knows what a “win” or “loss” will be?

                Their tanks are still “soviet era” as is American tanks are still “cold war era”. They’ve been updated and improved. Why change what most obviously works? Same with the U2 spy plane and B52 bombers. Mid-20th century basis for technology, but still used AFAIK.

The US may or may not starve longer but the West will certainly starve sooner.
I don’t know about the Chinese but Russia won’t be short Fertilizer or Grain and won’t be starving in the near future.

        I don’t remember a war where it was this hard to tell what is really happening. It is common for both sides to claim to be winning but very rare that it is not clear who actually is. Information is truly being weaponized.As for kinetic weapons, I think the trend is ‘smaller is stronger’. Man-portable missiles are beating tanks, small drones are beating huge, advanced air defense systems. This trend will probably continue. Drones will get smaller and come in swarms. Russia, with its large legacy military, seems to be behind the curve here. They are still infatuated with tanks just like the US is with aircraft carriers. Traditional militaries tend to be too conservative. It is instructive that Turkey, with a huge military full of huge hand-me-down weapons, is at the cutting edge of drone warfare. China’s strategy for countering the US Navy in the Pacific is also decidedly asymmetrical; missiles and drones instead of carriers and fighters. I think both the US and Russia may be somewhat hampered by having huge, prestigious legacy militaries that were decisive in the last great power war. Both are largely fielding modern, high tech versions of the weapons that won WW2. These old platforms are being mastered by new species of weapons that didn’t even exist before the 1970s and have come a long way since then.There is an interesting analogy to politics; both Russian and American brass have a hard time giving up their ships and tanks. Just like older conservatives have a hard time giving up civnat style patriotism. It is hard for old dogs to learn new tricks.

            Simba: “I don’t remember a war where it was this hard to tell what is really happening.”
Agree.  Biased Western outlets put the number of Russian dead from 7K to 15K.   This is hard to fathom.  I’d say the number is more like 1K to 2K.  But then I suck at math and can barely work a revolver.

                15k would be fantastically impressive numbers for the Uke’s to pull off. Their military, even the based Asov Battalion (or whatever these buttholes call themselves) were never considered decent.

                It’s fairly simple, from what I gather. Hell, I heard the Chinese outright stole their training simulator for it from a videogame called ” Children of a Dead Earth”. You could e en simulate it in Kerbal Space Program.

                    China, India and the US have done the same. Satellites are easy to spot and fly in predictable paths. It bears no relation to how you fight an infantry battle.

                And you’re exactly the kind of idiot that loses wars these days. Russia has the best missiles in the world, the US used to have the best air force. That is of marginal value in a land war against scattered infantry and insurgents. Which is why the Vietnam, Iraq and several Afghanistan wars went the way they did.

            The Turkish fellow who set up their main drone shop is a pretty smart guy who holds an MS from UPenn and MIT.
His UPenn MS was about:
“His master’s degree research involved a successful demonstration of air–ground coordination of UAVs in formation flight alongside territorial robot teams.”
That was back in 2004. That project landed him a full-ride to MIT to pursue further autonomous vehicle research.

On top of that, he’s even married into Erdogan’s family.

                I didn’t know that. It probably only takes a few genuinely smart guys, supported by a group of competent engineers, to set this up. India could become the world leader in this if they got their act together.The biggest obstacle is probably the conservatism of the brass and bureacracy. They want more of the old stuff, ‘that we know works.’ In the 19th century they were against first breech-loaders and then repeating rifles because they were afraid troops would waste too much ammo. The US Navy always wants another supercarrier and the Russians have tried to inaugurate a new generation of main battletanks with the T-14. Left to their own devices, old colonels and generals will try to perfect the bow and arrow before trying out a rifle.

                    Too much ammo used is sound military thinking odd as it seems.
When your logistics is at best horse carts or slow unreliable trucks  maybe in a few areas trains, having ammo shortages do to a high rate of fire is a real concern.
Logistics win wars .

                Something that may have helped Turkey rise to the top in drone warfare is that Erdogan, as an islamist, is traditionally hostile to the brass of the Turkish military. Since Ataturk, the military has always been the check on islamist tendencies. They almost used a repeated Pinochet model, only against islamists instead of marxists.
The curtailed prestige and power of the old brass may be why they decided to try something cutting edge instead of continuously upgrading their obsolescent M-60 tanks.

There are defenses against such things but they lead to just what Moran said, back to the 19th century since the only logical thing is to EMP the enemy city and send in extermination swarms.

        I predict small arms anti-tank weapons will start to fail very soon, as they are designed to exploit an enemy trying to avoid civilian casualties in urban combat. Russia will not treat Kiev like Mariupol, because they know now that Ukraine is using fascist fanatics who will not surrender to garrison the cities. You cannot reason with them and it’s futile trying to save civilians under their grasp.
Autonomous drones and strategic hypersonic missiles are the real innovations in this war, not the small arms missiles.

            Probably the most cost-effective way to counter drones is to have helium balloons tethered with acoustic sensors (drones will make some noise even those engineered for less sound) and either microwave or laser comms with each other, each having a wire communication to the base station. With dedicated marksmen in trees or other cover taking out a drone with direction finding help.
This can kill even autonomous non-radio-controlled drones. There is no substitute for the infantryman and marksmanship.

Which is why I guess Trump is still a free man, and alive. He is for the moment useful to Obama/Brandon and they see their main threat Hillary! who seems to have half the CIA and FBI working for her.

        Look at the conflict in the Ukraine as an excellent way to test modern U.S. ground weapons technology against a near peer military power without risking U.S. soldiers. You can bet that lots of bright people are collecting data. Forget about silly she-male Admirals and crying Generals, they are window dressing.

            No, they are as stupid as they appear. Navy ships and subs can’t stop colliding with other ships or underwater mountains. Dry docked ships are set on fire by gay-panicked sailors. Afghanistan was a mess and a rout, no doubt about it.Its Woke all the way down. There is no competent inner party. There wasn’t under Pol Pot, or Mao, or Stalin, or Brezhnev. And where oh where will new weapons come from? Harvey Mudd and MIT and CalTech are now all fully woke. Filled with “stem adjacent” woke black girls who displace the smart guys.This is a three front war: 1. Against fossil fuels for Green Fantasies; 2. Against White people and White males; 3. Against Russia/Putin.

                    I immediately started to wonder if there was a tacit agreement with the Taliban that the “abandoned” weaponry and such were their’s for the taking if they use it to stir shit against Russia and China. Not the first time the Borg has used islamist fanatics against perceived enemies of the Borg.
Of course, there were also all of those unvetted Afghani young men of military age being flown to the US, too. Maybe they perceive them as useful in the Borg’s war on normality right here in River City? Whaddya think, pilgrims?

                        Tacit? No. The military making an effort to bring stuff back at all is relatively new. Prior to the ’80s, stuff shipped overseas would be lucky to make it back Stateside, since it was obviously cheaper and easier to just dump it on the ocean. Logistics is king in any war. It’s hard and takes months to years to remove that much materiel from a theater. Considering the pullout happened in a matter of months, no way they were bringing everything back.

        Niall Ferguson (occasional bad thinker married to IIRC some Somali woman who was a minor bad thinker) has an op-ed in Bloomberg. His takeaways: 1. Brandon etc. are committed to total regime change in Russia, maybe also China, and will not relent. 2. Brandon etc. aim to bleed Russia dry as in Afghanistan via constant weapons.For point 2 first, the CIA World factbook informs me that Ukraine has only 2 million men ages 15-24. That its TFR is 1.5 (compared to Russia’s bad but better 1.75 and has actually INCREASED over the past ten years). That the median age of the mother at first birth is 26. The population is 70% urban. The idea that educated, urban, OLD (mostly middle aged and pensioners) populations that are Western not non-White, non-Western, tribal with 15 cousins, would fight like a non White, non Western tribal people is laughable. Even worse, the HBD’ers at Sailers who should know better cling to this hopium fantasy. Its pretty sad people who know intellectually that the media lies on everything still trust them.Point 1 — Putin (and Xi, also it seems at this point a target for regime change, see MBS in Saudi and Modi in India and AMLO in Mexico — the FT has hated him in particular for years) being the target of Regime change has his own counter-regime change weapons in place. The bad guys in WWII had blacks in Harlem dressed up as Mustache guy, and the Japanese Imperial intelligence funded first the Moorish Temple then Nation of Islam to try and forment a civil war in the US. The US then being 89% White, 10% black, 1% everything else was able to crush this at the cost of fragging incidents involving black troops against White ones, and a riot against Whites in Detroit in 1943, Philly also the same year. Not to mention an open borders, “refugees” as weapons in the US and Europe, and Cartels eager to expand their rule into the US.Related, the elite system is starting to crack. White seniors in a tony Brentwood prep school who previously were admitted at 80% to UC failed to gain admittance entirely. University of California abandoned the SAT, AP scores, and just admitted all blacks. Feels good man. Tuition is 60K a year and runs six years. These are not the billionaires or even millionaires, but their doctors, lawyers, accountants, and their kids just got pushed to Santa Monica City College, and an exciting career in the fast food industry. As Z-Man noted, every revolution requires some part of elites to side with it. It also generally requires outside support of some kind.

            The total fertility rate in Ukraine was actually 1.2 in 2021, and birth data is showing another 17% YOY decline for the first month of 2022.It’s possible the real fertility rate is quite a bit higher since the Ukrainian population estimates are way higher than actual, and there are also many emigrants who have children in other countries. Either way, whether it’s 1.2, 1.5 or 1.7 it’s still far off of the 6-7 that’s normal in Afghanistan. And most of Ukraine’s young people live abroad anyways.The Babushkas who make up most of Ukraine’s countryside won’t be doing much fighting for either side, regardless of a few media propaganda bits. And Russia has a low birth rate too, but it’s higher than China, higher than Ukraine, higher than the EU. They have fewer emigrants. And they have way more meat shields willing to die for the cause. Unless Ukraine starts importing Kurds nobody is going to do much insurgency.

                    How much of that is “real” though — its a place shot through with corruption. I know there was concern a few years ago about how few Britain had of combat jet pilots in the RAF, something like around 100. They likely also do not have many mechanics and in Ukraine I would be shocked if they had enough combat engineers, mechanics, etc. to keep planes flying, tanks and other vehicles moving, minefields cleared or laid down, etc. Pretty much all of Europe is suffering a shortage of White men and Ukraine’s size of only 2 million White guys of combat age is very significant. Their listed combat size of 300K is roughly 15% of the male combat age population. Does that even make sense?

The plants themselves were leveled in some of the opening Russian strikes, one of which took out the Antonov An-225 that was the world’s largest operational military cargo aircraft.

                    Insurgents need to eat too. There is no support for them locally and while they can steal some of the food, taking casualties in the process, they can only do that for a brief period of time
An insurgency without local or foreign support gets stomped. Also Afghanistan is in the middle of a famine as in mass starvation. So its not a great source.

            A Cold Civil War made up of various campaigns:
a Cold Race War
a Cold War on Whites ,and on “Whiteness” in all its manifestations
a Cold War on Masculinity (which is always described as “toxic”) and on Men
a Cold War on Sexual Normalcy
and on the very idea of Normal
a Cold War on Science, everywhere it conflicts with the sacred doctrines of wokeness
a Cold War on American History, and on our Ancestors
a Cold War on America As It Once Was….
&gt;&gt;&gt; Aren’t we seeing signs of this War everywhere we look?

        Our defense contractors remind me so much of our sick care system.  Billions upon billions shoveled into the industry, with less and less results.  A population that since 2014 has had average lifespans SHRINK while ever more billions are thrown into the black hole.  While fat nurses dance on TicToc.  It’s not just the MIC that’s broken. We have huge swaths of unproductive industry in “the private sector.”   The country screams “let me die already!”   The currency traders of the world will one day be the executioners, not Putin.  All roads lead to the dollar.  The tent pole in the middle of the circus tent.

            “All roads lead to the dollar. The tent pole in the middle of the circus tent.”(1) Russia is now demanding payment in rubles from European buyers of natgas. (2) Saudi Arabia is now accepting payment in yuan from China for crude. (3) Washington has conceived the brilliant idea of slapping sanctions on China. (4) Russia may move to a two-tier currency and back the *domestic* ruble with gold and let the *external* ruble float on ForEx markets. (South Africa had a two-tier currency at one point, so this does work.)Armstrong reports this morning that “RELIABLE [sic] sources” are reporting that Israel is very unhappy with Biden’s sanctions. So the power that can stop this madness is unhappy with the course of events.Will Israel issue the command to cease and desist? Will Washington obey that command?“The times, they are a-changin’.”

            A moderate famine would do wonders for the shambling mounds of visceral fat and lumbering hamplanets we call the Modern American.
I can’t say I’d be totally against making calorie intake prohibitively costly, it is clear that these pigs are not going to stop gorging at the trough and break their addiction on their own. It would stop men from having to look abroad for a woman with less than 30BMI too. A win-win, in my book.

        I tend to focus on what the American people will do in a situation like that.   As much as the media/political establishment will want to use these coming unfortunate events as a “unity” event, it will backfire in. a huge way.  The media will attempt, in vain, to turn a hand full of twerking shanequas into the new Andrews Sisters.  They’ll attempt to turn our culture into some cheesy Matt Damon WW2 movie, only where BIPOC finally gets to be the heroes of the story (unlike the 1940s).The reality on the ground will be a country that’s fractured beyond repair.  There will be social media uploads of people getting blown away at a Shell station over a couple gallons of gas, or an old lady being punched in the face for her cart of groceries.  We already see these, but it will be ubiquitous, not one offs.  I see a lot of grocery theft videos coming in the next couple years.  Many supermarkets will have to become pick-up only, with a security guard overseeing the process like some bank.   It sure as hell won’t look like the 1940’s.  It’ll look like a third world sh thole of desperate, stupid, and mostly dark people.  The illusion of racial harmony will have its final breakdown in the coming era.   But this is just a sliver of what we’ll see.  There will be all kinds of social breakdown.  Formerly upper middle class women in nice suburbs prostituting themselves.  People selling their kids, and not just to Dave Rubin.  It’ll go on and on.

                Distance matters, but that can change. Where I live, said ‘centers’ are 65 miles away. In the last year, those that represent the very “strength” of our nation have been on my dead end, breaking into vehicles, stealing one from my neighbor, used to ride around, then abandoned.Said strength of our nation was caught on video via my neighbor’s cameras, and I viewed them, delighted at how strong we were becoming, despite our distance from the center of diversity, our strength.More recently, the strengthening and diversity encouraging crime of stealing catalytic convertors came to our neighborhood. We know how much effort our strength partners put into this effort to strengthen our culture, as some of them were “arrested”, and the useful, helpful people of the 4th Estate listed their names and where they visited us from. They were promptly released, to return to their diverse base of strength and will be missed. Something about “bail reform”.As we undergo this exercise in strength, we had the benefit of two, not just one but two local sheriffs on our little road. They advised us that, in fact, the act of diverse persons trespassing on our property, rifling through our vehicles was “de-criminalized” and there was nothing they could do about it. They kindly took time to view my neighbor’s footage, and I must say they look very sharp in those crisp uniforms.When I raised the point regarding the “castle doctrine” in our state to our ‘back the blue’-deserving representatives of strength, the were impressive in their service-mindedness, reminding me that it was best to stay indoors if we were again the recipients of the gifts of strength as even raising a weapon at a window could bring charges against us.I did raise the point of, say my self, or worse daughter, mother or wife stumbled upon visiting diversity, strengthening us via their presence, could not events escalate beyond trespass, to assault, rape or murder, since our esteemed friends in law enforcement (or monitoring) stated such visits by our diversity were indeed no longer against the law?

                    Oh, and when I spoke with my new neighbor, recently moved from the very center of the strength that had kindly come to visit us, and made a comment celebrating that very strength represented by the visit?
My esteemed new neighbor man, truly nice people, had a blank look on his face. Went silent. Then apparently re-booted his mind to current narrative and went about looking at the screen where the strength was on his driveway, visiting.

In our time we have seen this place go from rural, to suburban, with tens of thousands of housing units built. It is now, quality of life-wise, becoming more “urban”.We have our escape planned and it includes increasing the distance from the diversity they tell is the “strength” of the nation. The process has been all about the “where”, but that has been narrowed down too.You are also correct in terms of the type of people we are surrounded by. Literally surrounded, as in new neighbors on all four sides, three of whom commute 2 hours a day into the heart of the shitlibopolis while keeping high end vehicles in pairs on their driveways.

                    Here’s the thing. I did not move into a “hood”. Yes, it was three decades ago but the area was rustic. Walk into town, shops owned by people that looked like what started back from mirror. Small theater.Never locked the doors. Mind you, 65 miles from the bluest of blue shitlipoplii and yet. Never. Locked. Doors.Walk to church. Local school dated back 100 years, still used for grades K-8.Now, local school an empty hulk, ma$$ive tax dollars on new, new, new despite declining enrollment. And as a cherry on top, local school district gets nailed, red handed, busing in illegals from other towns to fill seats …. and no one goes down. Memory holed.Homes that had a $1 on the front of them are selling for over half a million. Cottages, really, 1,000 square feet. And yet, those persons emanating from the blue shitlibopolis fall all over each other to snap them up. One savvy homeowner spent a few shekels to make a “green” home and … sakes alive, a pair of gay guys, married of course – nailed it! How lucky, they throw parties.My point is before the strength began to make us all stronger here, the place had tens of thousands of fewer people. Much. Weaker. But that’s where we bought – there were PLENTY of already strong places down the line. Some “hoods”, sure, but really suburbs nearer the heart of the strength.We did not choose those places. Doesn’t matter, strength spreads. Like mold.My parents are sanguine. They say “we moved twice for white flight, nothing new…”

            The globalists have been wanting to starve us for a long time. They’re obviously using Russia as a whipping boy for cutting off our fertilizer and fuel.
There’s no way they could have banned Russian fertilizer imports into Europe without something like the Ukraine conflict for a pretext.

        Before I write any further, I want to clarify: I despise our overlords. I am one of those who truly believe that we are rules by a mixture of bankers, families, and leaders (often interlinked) that worship the Devil and molest, abuse, and cannibalize children. I believe they run the world (especially the West). I also believe that they want to kill most of the people on the planet (including us). Knee jerk reaction, I also find myself wishing Russia success.However, I think we have to consider what happens if Putin successfully stalls the dominance of GAE with things such as a counter economic system.  I think we should all remember that we benefit from the rapacity of our overlords. We have benefited from USA colonization of most of the world. Couldn’t the crisis of a defeated dollar lead to the goals the elites seek in even more expedience? Not that I believe our views affect anything, but I feel that a victory for Russia would not be a victory for our lives. And, yes, I am aware, that, eventually, the average America will lose either way.

            Benefit how?  Will my pastimes and hobbies become much more expensive, my food and gas bill shoot to the moon? Yes, economic hard times are probably inevitable.  Sure there is a difference between 400 and 1000% annual inflation, but that is short term pain, years at most.My concern is the next generation. Is it better for my children’s future that I endure a bad economic depression that deposes the current order, or a mild depression that does not change the current order? I prefer moderate pain to me now than severe pain to my children later.

            Have we *really* been benefitting from GAE economic dominance? With all of our manufacturing and most of our energy exploitation exported overseas?A commenter below mentioned that the sanctions work like a protective tariff for the target country: forcing them to develop their own internal industries. But the protectionism can work both ways as well.If “American” companies are no longer able to offshore our manufacturing to cheap labor spots like Asia, and then reimport the “finished” goods, what do you think that will do to the domestic labor market? Or if cheap raw materials are no longer available from China/Russia, what will that do to domestic energy/mining industries?Globalism is not our friends. The only ones who benefit are the Schwabs, the Romneys, and the Bidens. Ending it will benefit every worker in the world: Russian, Chinese, or American.

                I suppose it depends on where you start.
embargoing a country with no natural resources is probably effective, as they have no basic material to leverage and would eventually run out.
Embargoing a nation with resource, and technical skills internally to use them to replace imports is just stupid as a concept.
I don’t believe you could ever embargo the US for example, even if you managed to, what would it achieve?
Therefore the embargo must have another reason(s), as it sure ain’t what is stated.

                    Before I respond, I want to again reiterate my opening: I think we are ruled by horrendous, wicked people. My point is that we cheer the victory of these peoples’ putative enemy, without considering the impact it has on our life. The overly simplistic “Putin is defeating the NWO” assumes that 1)He will and 2)We, in America, do not benefit from the order, AS OF NOW (as I clarified). I would just suggest that the overwhelming sentiment on this message board is “Yay Russia!” with the prevailing blindspot that an economic response by Russia may damn ourselves. To me, this strikes me as being spoiled. I don’t ask anyone to agree with me, but I think any reasonable person can agree I have a worthy of consideration point. And, once more, I am just suggesting a possibility I think many have ignored. We should consider the impact this stuff has at home, and recognize Russia’s success might impact us horrendously at home.Further, I think nearly exclusively of what is best for my kids, which is why I tend to root for the system that does not expose them to abject poverty. I fear any replacement of the current order will only make their lives worse. I am unvaccinated, and so are my kids. Any victory Russia has will only heighten the tyranny HERE. We will be the whipping boys.I would suggest that a counter to the GAE will not necessarily remove the current corrupt leaders. Anything that would remove our current leaders would be more than a depression. It gets worse every year – and we are even further from removing our overlords.I would also say ‘benefit’ as in ‘financially.’  Like it or lump it, we still have more buying power than most people and a better quality of life. Our ingratitude shows that. And any who would counter that I am fixated on money is wrong – I am quite anti-materialistic. I live a sparse existence with hobbies instead of entertainment.And it never fails to amaze me that people welcome mass casualty events and then fantasize that they will be among the few survivors, ignoring the odds.To me, answers like that showcase the type of person who loves Zombie movies and cheers for the zombie apocalypse. They imagine breaking free and running through the woods with an AR across their chest ‘surviving.’ In an apocalypse, we will be the zombies, based on pure odds.To anyone disagreeing with this: are you in good shape? Train regularly? Have a homestead with sustainability in food, water, and energy?

                        I am not cheering for anything. I think they incredibly harmful to the west itself.
I am merely pointing out the sanctions are completely without logical foundation conceptually given Russia’s resource and population, and therefore must serve some other purpose.
Dovetailing with the demand destruction and build back energy rhetoric across all of Govt it seems clear what that is.
Living in Europe, we are going to feel the effects 100x more than the US, who can be energy and material self-sufficient to a large degree.

                        Trumpton – I agree with you completely. I again agree that the sanctions are about instituting a Global Reset – as they promise. I guess my main thesis is: this is not going to end well – regardless of any short term outcome. I agree with the points of others regarding outsourcing. The wolf has been grabbed by the ears, and we are going to get bit either way. And, personally, I hope it does occur later rather than sooner – so my kids have more time to grow up.

                        the reason i disagree with your use of the word “benefit” is because i am old enough to remember the quality of life for middle class Americans before the advent of 2 income households.  your focus on money has blinded youm IMO.

“Russian victory” meaning what exactly? In the current police action in the Ukraine? Or in some what that reduces or destroys the power of the Yankee dollar? Those are not at all the same things. I’m not sure what you mean.

        Off Topic:I’ve been recovering from the China flu (unvaccinated, of course). It was about 2 days of mild cold symptoms, then a day of feeling like complete crap: fever, fatigue, headache and chills, then another day of feeling a little less crappy with no fever. That’s basically it.If we had never heard of “COVID” I would have just assumed that I caught a nasty bug, and been thankful for the short fever and quicker than expected recovery.After 2 years of lockdown the virus is still with us, surprise. My american friends caught the same thing 2 years ago and have lived mostly normally since. What a joke. If you’re old or unhealthy you might have a problem from the virus since the fever was quite heavy that one day. Other than that it’s fine.

            Yep.
I’m fortunate to be living in a rural community on Colorado’s western slope, where most people I associate with have been ignoring Covid ever since the “pandemic” began.
Most folks I know have not only been ignoring masks and social distancing, they never stopped hugging, or passing joints at parties.
Those few who have gotten mildly sick have quickly recovered; their immune systems no doubt stronger as a result.
I’m 71 years old. I keep waiting for Covid to kill me, but it appears that rumors of my death are premature.

                Were they vaccinated? Because some doctors are suggesting that vaccination only makes your chances of complications and/or death more likely. Some suggest that it’s the spike proteins that the rMNA vaccine causes your body to produce, that are causing the various complications being reported.But yeah: I’ve heard those stories too: of people outside the most vulnerable groups falling ill. They’re statistical outliers, but nonetheless are happening. So there’s a lot we don’t know.Last CDC stats I saw were that those who died had a median age of 78 and an average of 2.6 other pre-existing conditions. In other words, like any flu, it mainly kills those who are already vulnerable.And we’re all going to die sometime….

                    Covid’s death toll, of course, is wildly inflated. People who have been dying from the usual suspects, principally diabetes and heart disease, have been classified as Covid deaths. Truth be told, actual Covid mortality is probably about five percent of the official number.

                        The UK health ministry put their figure at 12%, and I am sure they are not as wildly overcounting as we are.  So your 5% smells about right.  If there were no Covid specific tests, we would be calling it a bad Flu year.

A robust immune system.
Also, exposure doesn’t mean infected. And anyway, there is not now nor has there ever been a diagnostic procedure for Covid. So it’s not that the case numbers have been wildly exaggerated; it is that there is no diagnostic test, so all the case numbers are bogus.
Period.
The allopathic medical establishment and the public health “profession” are rackets.

                        Yep: it’s all about having a healthy immune system. That’s why the majority of deaths are occurring among people whose immune systems were already compromised.And yeah: LOTS of false positives: very helpful if your goal is to run up the numbers.As is the media’s tendency to talk about “cases”— including all those false positives— rather than deaths.And to classify as “death  from Covid” anyone who dies with “Covid-like symptoms”, whether they were tested or not.Only one reason I can think of why people who know better would set up such a sloppy protocol: to turn a slightly-worse-than-normal flu season into a society-threatening “pandemic”.The old “national security” rationale for arbitrarily restricting Americans’ freedoms was wearing thin. Now we have a new one: “public health emergency”

                        TIP. Gee, that’s funny.  My last bloodwork detected antibodies specific to Covid.  So they lied to me?  But if they lied to me (because there is no real test for Covid), then why was my blood test 6 months prior negative for Covid antibodies?  Do they flip a coin and port random results to the same client?But then aside from blood work from a private lab, there was the County PCR test 6 months before that, which was positive.  I guess it was one of those juiced up tests designed to deliver high levels of false positives.But if that were so, then why were the tests of most of the immediate family group not all positive? All PCR tests simple report random negatives/positives?  Covid roulette? Seems like quite a convenient (self-serving) explanation.The disease is real.  The testing (when done—it was not in the initial wave) is good enough for broad analysis of extent of disease.  Everything else about it I agree is subject to interpretation through one’s own good common sense.Period.

                    I disagree, but have no reference to point to.  One need not “test” every new infection for genotype/antigen, only a sub sample of the newly infected population.  This is easy enough to do at the hospitals or the county’s central health administration with blood samples sent in.  That method I assume is how they measure those with the new variant vs those with the old, or another variant.This is not rocket science.  Now as to whether we are being lied to is another story, but that would need to be coordinated across several countries where the variant strain of Omicron is said to be taking hold.  That I believe is not nearly as likely as within the USA—but I’m bias here.Also, that there are variants cropping up and the reason for these variants is not out of line as per older epidemiology science and theory believed before this latest pandemic.  There is theory to explain the promotion of variants through indiscriminate vaccination, theory to explain milder forms of the original disease with these variants, and 100 years of observation of endemic flu around the world.Period.

            I got it also over Christmas along with pretty much my whole family. I was pretty bad for 48 hours or so, temperature, chills, headaches, sinusy. Got better pretty fast. Then a good 3-4 days later, lost my smell for a good 5 days. So weird. Never happened to me before as far as I can recall. Took vitamins C and D several times a day, zinc as well, NAC, and quercetin. Took artemisin once too. Kept taking the vits and zinc and some NAC after the illness for a week or so.

            They already have.
The Russians have been capturing US export electronics since they rolled the Georgians South Ossetia in 2008.
They captured newer versions at points in Syria.
I’d bet they had FSB and GRU guys going over the stores of the latest stuff left behind in Afghanistan offering the Taliban hard currency.
In Syria and Afghanistan they likely had many opportunities to pick up US-spec gear along the way.
They probably offered to share some with the Chinese if the Chinese weren’t able to grab their own.

            I wonder how many of those Javelin strikes were “own goals,” since the Ukrainians possess similar weapons and vehicles. Also (snark alert), I can’t help but think that someone might have confused Javelins and Stingers, and instead of downing a Hind gunship blew up one of his own BMP carriers. Let’s hope that the crew and squad were taking a smoke break when–if–this happened.

        I just don’t get how we’re ruled by the sorts who were easily dispatched with swirlies and backhands in junior high. Kids were stronger then than ‘adults’ are today.
What can you do but wait for real hardship to toughen people up, at a terrible cost? Being the sort who likes to win and do justice, it’s torturous. Or you accept the that there’s a greater justice being done to a wicked and deserving society, hope you aren’t among the damned, and position yourself the best you can.

                    Not just radical hebes, though they stick out like a sore thumb. All sorts, none of whom are formidable, except in their ability to agitate, subvert, play head games. And it’s only the public’s weak-mindedness that their power rests on.
You figure it out, how weak it is, you become indifferent to it, it stops affecting you. Taking that society-wide is the hard part.

I’m pretty sure the Russians and Chinese have much more experience with hunger than some Dorito eating, latte swilling Millennial or latter generation. More importantly, what will the brain dead do when their sail phones go dead or get turned off due to inability to pay?

While those with the sense and foresight to have distanced themselves from sacred “minorities” live to tell the story and write the history.
After a time in which welfare-state “safety nets” of “entitlements” temporarily subverted the process of evolution, Darwinian survival of the smartest and most-capable reasserts itself in a big way….

                You say that, maybe in jest, but it is pretty interesting to think about how many days of missed shipments it would take before riots started. I’ve seen shortages of staples in my farm-belt city happen when stores tried going from six deliveries a week to five. In all seriousness, I’d guess that it would take eight days of missed deliveries to spark riots.

The one-world digital “Currency” that is already in the works. The hologram in the White House signed the exec order on the 8th, I think it was.And in my opinion, that is FAR more dangerous than being inconvenienced by not finding spare ribs at the store.Everybody who *can* say NO to the CBDC*must* have a *workable* plan *ready* when the time comes *and* have everything in place or in hand that they will need to put the plan into effect.It’s later than you think.

            “I’m pretty sure the Russians and Chinese have much more experience with hunger … .”
True enough, but remember that the floods in China–brought about by the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum (remember that?)–had the Three Gorges Dam so close to failure that they destroyed millions of acres of farmland by engineered flooding upstream to relieve stress on the dam, and thereby lost 50% of their *food crops* last year, and they had lost 30% the year before that to heavy rains and flooding, and China was already a net importer of food before that.

        It will be fascinating, in a perverse way, to see how today’s diverse ‘American’ responds to genuine financial and dietary hardship.  Totally aside from the virtues of various missiles and tanks (that’s my husband’s purview and I will get his opinion when I read this to him tonight), most people seem utterly unaware of the sort of economic repercussions many of us expect within the next 6-18 months.  Fertilizer?  Harvests?  Cost of livestock feed?  Culling livestock?  It’s crickets all the way down.  And, so far as I know, all those container ships are still backed up out in the ocean.Here in the DFW area we’ve been rather fortunate – nothing I’ve been unable to find or purchase and even gas has dropped significantly (hubby saw it yesterday for $3.69).  But there are places in America where significant shortages are already a regular occurrence and I’m just starting to see comments from Europeans re shortages of flour and more importantly cooking oil.  And Germany is purportedly predicting its eggs will run out by June or so.  But mention Avian flu and its spread not just internationally but throughout America and the consequences of culling millions (out of admittedly billions) of chickens, and again, crickets.  Interesting times.

            I have generally felt that the “get out of the cities” memes were overblown although sincere. That was wrong. Being near vibrants during food shortages tends to be fatal.
I knew chicken had increased even more exponentially than red meat, but did not realize avian flu was a factor.

Not to mention the approaching shortage in chemical fertilizers.
Fortunately, there is a cheap alternative: paramagnetic rock dust.
I’ve held forth about that in here before, so I’ll say no more about that. But get your hands on some while there is an intact distribution system.
It’s later than you think.

            Dont be such a Pollyanna,3g. Eggs production is nonfungible, like crude oil can only be refined with appropriately tailored facilities for that type of crude: the market production for retail is a small sector.  Most farmed eggs are bulk sold in liquid via 275 gallon ibcs for industrial processing – mcdonalds et al. Retail facilities are very different for washing, sanitizing and packaging eggs for grocery stores. If the retail producers are the ones that get hit with the new avian flu, grocery store prices for eggs can go vertical.

        This is brutal truth, and this is the only place you will find it. Most of MSM is furiously promoting propaganda lies and Tucker Bongino are still stuck preaching the vote-harder canard. When everyone is a whimp, the thought of a collapse and rebirth of hardship is terrifying. So best to stick your head up your ass and hide from the truth. Allow me to contribute some more truths.The “Last Superpower” is led by a corrupt dementia patient and everyone within the DC bubble thinks this is just a minor inconvenience. These politicians desperately believe that “our” crisis is the coming election, and as soon as the next batch of RINOs get into power, it will be “happy days are here again.” But the real reality is that we need this collapse in order to snap out of the Comfort First Imperative. Until people are genuinely hungry and hurting, they will not get serious about a remedy. This is ancient human nature and cannot be massaged by clever internet memes.But we don’t have to stay in the pit of the collapse forever. We can, and should, aspire for a quick rebound. The fog of chaos is your friend. The disease is obvious. Targeted chemo is much more efficacious than blunderbuss chemo when treating metastatic cancer. Whining, wailing, and street protests are not chemo. Think outside the box.I’m going to paraphrase a famous line from a movie in the way-back times.“If you incentivize them, they will leave.”

            The elites have been preparing for a collapse for a long time, if these past years if not decades of their looting of everything in sight is an indication of where they thought this ship was ultimately heading.They’ve been preparing for collapse for a long time, and stowing away all their acorns.  Making the right connections,  building bunkers, buying farmland.But now that that time is upon them, they don’t seem to be ready for it and to know what to do.In ways it’s humorous, in others dumbfounding, but they have been preparing their entire adult and professional lives for the collapse and they seem to be caught flat footed and off guard.

                The furious looting is a sign they know collapse is imminent. Also, intellectual titan Mike Tyson nicely sums up the elite confusion about things not going to plan despite their best efforts: everyone has a plan until they get hit in the mouth. The hit in the mouth, in this case, is China giving D.C. a good hardy LOLGF. I didn’t expect it, and thought there was some 4D chess at play (the Bigfoot of analysis), but, naah, they never considered their fairweather plans in Beijing would put the pencil to them.

                When you have ridiculous wealth, it’s easy to purchase ridiculously over-the-top panic rooms, secure retreats, and mercenary guards to man the parapets. And because of all that, when it fails in response to highly motivated innovation, the impact can be enormous. Stampedes start this way. Not everything can be anticipated and overconfidence is a cruel bitch. It’s hard to live the good life when you’re constantly looking over your shoulder.

                    The problem that wealthy people and preppers both generally ignore is that being alive 2+ months after day one of the collapse requires having regular access to clean water, non-spoiled food, and emergency resources. Those things require an orderly, productive society or essentially a fully-functional, self-sufficient farm. If you don’t have at least one of those things within a couple weeks of the first day of collapse, you’re survival odds won’t be any different than those of the completely unprepared.

                        My thinking follows yours.I prep just enough to get by.  My life has gone from hurricane to earthquake country, and so I know how to survive for a while.But I always found that over-prepping was something of a waste of time and energy for reasons you note.  Further, you don’t want to over-prepare and stunt your ability to think on your feet, to rely on your wits and keep them always fresh, which seems to me to be a better way to get by when the S really hits the fan.  Sort of like a boxer who prepares for a 12 round fight by training only for 8 rounds, because after 8 you want to dig deep into your soul and allow it to take over.  To see what you are really made of.  I think knowing what you are really made of is very important.

                    TomA:WRT to always looking over your shoulderWhen I used to watch Fox News I noticed they would always have on guys being interviewed who were jittery and glancing left and right all the time.  Did you ever notice it?And it is why I never understood the mafia.  How can anyone live knowing that at any moment you can get whacked?  I don’t get the calculations these guys would make: ok I get nice cars and a nice place and a mistress or two, but it can end at any time.  Seems to me that making an honest living is far better.

            This may be the moment when those with the foresight to understand what they’re seeing realize that the days of America as ‘superpower’ are over. The era when we could call the shots on the world stage, and no one could oppose us, has ended.
Instead of continuing to imagine that we can dictate results, we need to start paying attention to what other nations are doing, and what the unintended consequences might be if we continue to let our delusions of grandeur color our perceptions and our actions.

                “Instead of continuing to imagine that … .”That would require a totally different environment: culture, population demographics, political system, all of it: a totally different environment.Our political-cultural system has brought us to this point. It could never have brought us to any other place. So I don’t think that wise, judicious decisions and actions can be realistically expected from our rulers or from our neighbors.These are people who will believe literally anything, and apparently the stupider and more unlikely, the more believable.When Tom A says to think outside the box, he just might mean the idiot box, for it is now undeniably clear that TV mediates reality for prolly 80% of the population.Universal suffrage and such like guaranteed from the beginning that we would end up here, and nowhere else. It was baked into the cake a LONG time ago.

                Another inside baseball insight. The diesel shortage has been manufactured as a lame attempt to thwart the trucker protests. Refineries can alter and shift crude molecules between gasoline, avgas, diesel, heating oil, and heavies as the market demands. It’s a choice usually driven by market &amp; processing economics, but politicians have no qualms about fucking this up also.

That OR Britain pays Russia–in rubles–for more fuel.
And let’s not forget that the “sanctions from hell” end in August. Unless hey extend, of course.
The question is, can we make it till August? (And I *think* the expiry date is the 31st, but don’t feel like looking it up.)

        What’s old is new again. The United States and Europe are attempting a good old-fashioned blockade of Russia. But instead of using ships, we’re using banks and the dollar.As Z mentions, Russia hasn’t really brought out its big guns in this battle, preferring to see if it can get around the sanctions and/or create an alternative trading system first. (I don’t think Putin really wants to destroy Europe’s economy if he can avoid it.)And just as everyone is getting to see how military weapons perform in real battles, the world is watching what economic weapons are being employed by both sides and how they perform. China, India and the rest of the world will adjust as needed.I think what caught everyone off guard, besides the seizure of central bank reserves, has been the speed and willingness of private corporations to impose their own sanctions on Russia. Oil companies pulling out of Russia, shipping companies refusing to ship Russian oil, etc.My suspicion is that our rulers would have preferred that this not happen. There’s a reason that we excluded energy from the sanctions. But cancel culture has been so ingrained in our society that the companies reacted as they’ve been trained: stop doing business with this week’s bad guy.Regardless, for the first time in a very long time, Americans are going to feel the costs of GAE at home. The Europeans are already dealing with dramatically rising energy costs.I’ve always said that our rulers can throw a good punch but can’t take a punch. I suspect that we’re about to find out if that’s true.

                This. People need to stop thinking about giant, global corporations as “private companies”. They are not. They are equivalent to nation-states in terms of resources, scale, ideology, and global reach.
Only difference is that these nation-states don’t employ modern militaries to protect their leadership should things get hot…

            Correct.
Putin wants a deal. His demands are not unreasonable at all. He wants an enforced neutrality for the Ukraine, and an end to the corruption there in various trade agreements that is costing them billions a year. Zelensky and the people that own him have been goading the Russian bear forever.
Putin just fired back with all petro deals now having to be with Rubles. Our elites are playing with fire. Don’t be surprised if it isn’t a Russian that comes charging into the Jewish temple, whipping the money changers and upending their tables…

                    No, it’s just that the Israelis are a bit more tied to reality than their American cousins.
They have to run a country where they actually care about the people, unlike their cousins. They also can’t just get up and move to another country like their cousins. Makes them more realistic.

                    Rubles is better in the short term.
You can’t use the FX markets to collapse the currency if you need it to pay for the goods.
Also, if you are buying the currency from the Russian central bank what are you using to buy it with?
And where does that foreign currency go?

What they ought to do is to institute a bi-level ruble, as South Africa did at one point.
And back the *internal* ruble with gold and let the *external* ruble float on the ForEx markets.
That would help the West to see more clearly b/c it would clarify things considerably. 😉

            My guess would be that Putin saw how during Covid the major corporations jumped in and did the government’s dirty work and, even if not required to, set up their own internal vaxx mandates, etc.
That these major corps are just extensions of the government is something I think the world has already grasped and have been preparing with it in mind.

Higher cost of *everything* b/c higher energy prices … you know.
“I’ve always said that our rulers can throw a good punch but can’t take a punch. I suspect that we’re about to find out if that’s true.”
For my money, this is the most dauting thing of all. We are soon going to know *exactly* what it means when we call our rulers “insane.”
But how much time will we have left to digest the answers after we find out how insane they are? Or how they are insane?

        If 30 years of rampant warmongering in Afghanistan, Iraq, even Vietnam (earlier) has conclusively proved anything, it’s that the days of stealing territory with mass armies are over.You can wreck infrastructure and murder civilians with impunity, but with MASS CONSCRIPTION, you’ll never be able to hold it.“When you take the king’s shilling, you’re expected to kill for the king”.Men around the world in all societies refuse to take that Faustian bargain in enough numbers to permanently take another country.All volunteer armies with fancy toys can destroy nations, but no one (other than the very narrow interests who profit from it) will thank them.

                        Karl is correct.
The military has been eyeing obesity as a serious impediment to filling recruiting targets since the late 00s.
As far as opportunities for young men now, I’d say the trades are where it’s at.

                        Last I read, 75% were unready for even boot camp.  There are bunches of videos on recruits entering boot.  In the one I watched, they arrived by bus at night and were promptly put to PT by the DI’s. Just push-ups.
I’m 70 and swear I can outdo at least 50% of the recruits at that point.  (And yes, I actual do those exercises so I have numbers.) One hopes they can improve quickly, but damn man—you know you are going in, you think you’d cut the BS and start exercising *before* you embarrass yourself.

                    “Why they may try to starve and impoverish us and collapse our standard of living … .”
That’d be a helluva tightrope act. They’d have to know *exactly* how low they could take our living standards, AND they’d hafta know *precisely* what portion of the population they could take down to what level, since different demographics–and we got a bunch of ’em–would “break” at different levels.
I doubt they could do it. They’d be dragged into the streets and torn to pieces. It’s living standards that everything else stands on.

            If we had to ponder what we’re going to do to rebuild after a collapse with ourselves being the only thing we had to worry about, that would be one thing, but the Chinese have other plans for our homeland.A collapse here would be a green-light for them to start landing troops en mass. It wouldn’t take a lot, perhaps no more than 30k to pacify an area large enough to bring in the follow-on forces.

                    Yeah the physical invasion already happened 40 years ago.
They wouldn’t even need to send in troops today, all the non CCP aligned on the Vancouver/Richmond city council would just find themselves locked out one morning and a law would be passed to add Vancouver as a SAR.
The police would receive updated objectives and agents in corporations would honor the new law.
I believe it could be done in one morning with no bloodshed. It’s already happened, nobody’s signed the paperwork to make it official yet.

            Disagree. We haven’t seen something similar since the late 1940s, but a relatively-small number of armed men can round up all the unarmed civilians in a village and load them onto buses, trains, or cattle cars, and ship them off to the frontier. Holding onto conquered populations might be impossible, but keeping the land would be pretty easy if you expel the population and replace them with your own.

        The proliferation of drones, especially those with attack capabilities, seem to be a counter to the new SAMs.  They are cheap[er] than conventional warplanes; there is no loss of skilled pilots if destroyed; their lower speed and lack of  large radar profile and relatively low infrared/heat signatures all speak to the ability to get in close and destroy the SAM sites, enabling more conventional air ops.  Of course, electronic warfare, jamming and the like, will they become paramount.

            Point defenses and EW against drones are already in play. The Russians have shot down copies of the Turkish drones that were so effective in the Azeri-Armenian war.
The absolutely incompetent Armenian response to the Azeri use of drones in their recent war made drones look like a panacea.
That said, you are correct that drone swarms render piloted planes mostly obsolete. Imagine how many missile-armed drones you can field for the price of one F-35.

                Drones require intact c&amp;c communications.  If that fails, or fails enough, then they are not a replacement for piloted craft, esp for combined arms close air support.  Probably its just in between, everyone has to have everything and use whatever tool suits the conditions. This is not actually chess, everyone can move more than one piece at a time.I think the big change is going to be targets.  With our current strategy, globohomo troops arent going to be trying to get through air defense to bomb their troops and tanks, but their refineries, banks, and ISP’s.  War is now primarily an economic sanction, from the perspective of the Western powers.  Good luck putting an anti-drone air defense around every power grid transformer and branch bank (I think i just heard Raytheon make a mess in their collective britches).

                    A well-fought and strategized war is fundamentally an economic assault. An army that wants a quick surrender will do well to burn it’s enemy’s fields and forests. Sanctions are just the modern version of Sherman’s March to the sea. In Consequently, resisting Globo Homo needs to fundamentally be a financial tactic, not shooting tactic. Canceling Netflix might not be as satisfying a daydream as riding in to Hollywood and shooting up a movie studio full of libs, but it’s much more effective.

            “The proliferation of drones, especially those with attack capabilities, seem to be a counter to the new SAMs.”
The reports I’ve read say that the Russians are making short work of the drones used thus far. Turkey seems to be the major supplier of drones to the Ukraine in the current police action.

        One major problem is that we now have women in positions of power making decisions about war. Sorry to veer a bit off topic but just learned that March has been women’s month. I guess next month will be dedicated to fat, hairy men in lipstick and dresses.Years ago, my sister did some pet/house sitting for a family from Iran who were devout Christians. The husband’s email correspondence with her always ended in flowery wording: “May the Lord, God of heaven and earth shower blessings upon you…”My sister was in the process of responding and was conflicted about how she should close out her message. My dad told her to respond the way we respond. That may be his way of doing things but it is not ours. It may be his culture but it is not our culture. It was another eye opening lesson on the differences between men and women.Women should be wives and mothers. Those who don’t marry can be librarians, secretaries, nurses, teachers of primary children. Placing women in charge has been a disaster. Women’s suffrage has only caused the suffering of women, families, society.

            Salient points all, however all of the problems we see in indoctrination today – the summoning of police at school board meetings, the “woke” crap everywhere – is all propagated by single, childless women. Are you sure you want them in teaching positions?

                Good point.If the women’s movement had been quashed, perhaps divorce would never have been promoted and celebrated as it was in the 70’s. We’d be living in a society with strong, in-tact families.

                    Yeah, it’s truly amazing: all the news stories featuring “single moms”, with no mention of a male. An observer from Mars would likely get the impression that sexual reproduction in humans can happen single-handedly.
All part of the war on men, and the disparagement of masculinity, that characterizes ‘wokeness’.
How long can a society last which deliberately undermines normalcy?
Meanwhile, both Russian and Chinese societies are actively encouraging traditional notions of masculinity and femininity….

        From the beginning, it’s been clear that Ukraine alone cannot possibly win this war against Russia.For western leaders and mainstream media to keep on encouraging the Ukrainians to persist in fighting— for the media to continually fill the airwaves with positive stories about brave Ukrainians standing up to beastly brutal Russians, reports implying that Russia is weakening, that Russian tanks are stalled, along with “expert” predictions that the Russian economy won’t be able to survive the sanctions— all the while insisting that they have NO intention of joining the fight themselves — it’s like they WANT the Ukrainians to keep persisting in this suicidal endeavor that has no chance of succeeding. it’s like they WANT the war to be as cruel, destructive, and devastating as possible, in order to be able to paint Putin as the worst possible sort of heartless international villain.From Zelensky’s constant stream of pitiful calls for help— help which no western observer believes is forthcoming— it appears that he’s been led to believe that the west might intervene; that NATO might decide to bring Ukraine in as a member, then join in its defense.How is it that Zelensky is so deluded in his expectations? How is it that he keeps on pleading for something which no one else believes is possible: something that the NATO nations themselves keep insisting they they will never do?Is this whole charade a set-up to prolong the war and make Russia/Putin look as bad as possible?And don’t western leaders realize that the likely longterm effect of economic sanctions is not to destroy the Russian economy and ‘bring Russia to its knees’; but rather, to push Russia towards industrial self-sufficiency, and into a productive alliance with China and India; and possibly to bring about the formation of a yuan-based international banking/exchange system not reliant on the dollar, and devastating to the US economy?Is this— all of the above— somehow what they want— “they” being whoever is responsible for setting the tone of media coverage, and dictating sanctions against Russia?

            Not in answer to your questions, but merely to applaud you for asking them:I have for the most part avoided any reportage of the current Russia-Ukraine conflict. Why? For the very simple, albeit rather cynical supposition on my part that all, or very nearly all, of what I’d hear, see or read is propaganda, one-sided at best and gross distortion at worst. To the extent I spend any mental effort on it, I’d rather think:What is the background of the conflict? What Western interests, known or probable, were/are there is the warring nations? What economic shifts, centers of power, are shifting? Who benefits from Scenario A over Scenario B? Why are events being narrated a certain way? What is not being discussed? And so on.The following is my provisional opinion, admittedly mostly from general “conspiracy theory” and not necessarily any deep investigations. There are so many rabbit holes, and even for a retired layabout, only so many hours in a day to explore them.The “West” has its hands dirty with Ukraine. Hunter Biden Laptop and Burisma is perhaps only the tip of an iceberg. What are the links of Biden, perhaps others, to this nation?The USA reportedly had bio-laps there. How many? Two dozen? Even U.S. officials have (mistakenly?) admitted as much. What other shadowy activities have we been involved with? CIA training of factions? To what ends?Western interests had (still have some?) many financial ties with Russia and I suppose, Ukraine. Now that these investments have been frozen or made worthless, who profits? Who loses? What angles exist to manipulate markets? By whom?There are any number of possibilities. But I can’t think of any greater waste of time than consuming mass media, unless it was to try to second-guess the ministries of propaganda.

The United States strung along Ukraine to achieve several goals. One was to divorce Europe from Russia. Increasingly, a second appears to be to strangle the domestic economy and bring it under even more control. All of these things will have dire consequences. Europe will look even more askance at America, and the United States economy is becoming a pariah.The war in Ukraine as far as the people and nation is totally irrelevant.

                Yes, as far as US strategic/national interests goes, the war in Ukraine has no effect on us at all.
However— if economic sanctions against Russia end up in a situation in which Russia and other Eurasian nations join with China in developing a yuan-based international exchange system, which replaces the dollar-based system that’s been in effect since WWII— that WILL have a profound effect on us.

        In every war the US has started since WW2, the opposition has no real effective counter to its air superiority – until now.  The US delights in foisting its big bad military on third world s***holes that don’t have an equivalent force – and we still can’t win.  No doubt taking on the Russians will change all that…

            Excellent article, tfpSo the question becomes:Did western leaders not realize that arming Ukraine would be recognized as a red line by Russia? A situation which they couldn’t allow to happen?Did western leaders imagine that Putin is like Obama: who announced a red line in Syria, then backed down when it was crossed? That Putin would back down rather than resort to arms?Or— if they knew what the likely result would be of continuing to provoke Russia— what are they up to?Were they simply too stupid to see this all coming? Or is something else going on?

            ” … the most concise and reasoned explanation of how and why Russians invaded by John Mearsheimer.”
Odd that he doesn’t mention that the Ukrainians bombarded the Donbas for 8 years, killing around 14,000 Russians. From 2014 until last month.

        The future of total war is going to be doing everything you can to crash an enemy’s economy to reduce the people to starvation? Very bleak, but I suppose that’s in line with the history of it.
In the end, it’s probably better that war features those sorts of stakes. The way mid-late 20th century America went to war and experienced limited hardship (if any)  really just helped bolster the Empire’s belief they could sell Americans on anything. Fatigue sets in eventually, but only after too long has past.

            There has always been a moral aspect to war. People will fight to the death if they believe they are n the side of angels. Starvation, on the other hand, saps people of that belief.

            The problem with that is its obvious that its going to be Europe that is reduced to starvation and energy poverty not Russia.

                I think a long-term result will be further estrangement of Europe from the United States. This is ironic because a primary goals seems to have been to divorce Europe from Russia. Outside of the UK and to some degree Germany, Europeans governments tend to be more responsive to their citizens so they will have to act.

                        If you take out the refugee and Green issues, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia (kind of EE, I know), Holland, even France. Only the US and UK really don’t mind economically harming their own outside of refugees and energy prices. Even Germany wants consumer goods for both export and their own citizens.

So if you take out replacing their own population with foreigners and reducing their population to energy starvation, controlled movement and food poverty they are more responsive?

                    Yeah, I think I agree, and demographically it makes sense that America leaves Europe’s orbit and enters into the orbits of central and South America and fulfills its 21st century mestizo and mulatto destiny.   We are only a 50% European country anymore.   If that.  The utter lack of interest in Ukraine I see among the non-whites speaks volumes.

            We’re watching the first digital/banking war in real time. Much like soldiers and generals in WWI and then WWII had to learn and adapt to modern, industrial warfare, the world is watching, learning and adapting to modern economic warfare.
Central bank reserves in the currency of hostile countries turned out to be the Maginot Line of this war.
This will have a lot of knock-on effects.

        Instead of trench war, this century’s great war will mean barriers to trade and capital.
Trade and capital shenanigans are the cause of war, not the result. Tariffs were the true impetus to the War Between the States in 1861. Energy embargoes made the Japanese so unhappy that they bombed Pearl Harbor. Today the US interference in Russian sales of natural gas to American colony Germany is perhaps the root cause of the beef jolt in eastern Europe.

                    Pickle Rick:  Perhaps it depends on who is waging war on whom.  Ideology certain matters more to the ‘Americans’ waging war on Russia via Zelensky and Ukraine (the rainbow flag must fly over the Kremlin).  It’s akin to Hollyweird pushing movies that may not do as well financially but push their anti-White ideology hard.But the fact that many of them have gotten richer via stripping Ukrainian resources and now get richer still via kickbacks and MIC contracts is certainly a plus as far as they’re concerned.   I would argue they do not merely want to win militarily in order to win ideologically, but they are also determined to see their enemies suffer economically.  More than physical territory, they want to control the levers of power and prosperity.  Controlling what people think and say while economically immiserating them is the goal.  While crying out, all the time, at how much  their enemy is causing world suffering.

                    US Marine hero Smedley Butler summed it up: “War is a racket”. It’s a money-making enterprise. If the riches can’t be swindled out of the weak they must seized by force. The ideology of the Russian state and the US have actually become more similar as time has gone by as Tomas Sunic points out, which has made them more competitive economically. While the Soviets were a military threat to the West they were never an economic adversary. Now the Russians are a growing part of the world economy, especially in Europe, and the US doesn’t need the competition.

                Economics, though, can be a weapon. Nordstream 2 has been killed, at least temporarily, and divorcing Europe from Russia seems to have been a goal because the alliance was seen as slipping away (which might have happened over time anyhow). Those European governments more responsive to their own people, ironically, may have to sever from the United States as the energy and food supplies start to dry up.
Just as the case with Covid, the unintended consequences will be a killer.

                    Jack,
I wonder how long Nordstream2 will stay shut down?
Recalling that Getmany has already shut down half of their electricity-generating nuclear power plants, and are planning on shutting them all down in the near future: will Germany’s citizens be OK with sacrificing their standard of living in order to sanction Russia? Will they really stand by and watch while Russia finds another market for their natural gas, which they surely will?
Or will Germans realize that it may be in their best interests to start trading with Russia and China instead of the US?

                        I think the Germans will stay strong until the Autumn. Then they will realise they have no fuel for winter and not many rubles to hand. Germans are like most Europeans: hapless, obedient sheep. But even sheep revolt when they get cold and hungry. However, I also believe that things may have sorted themselves out for better or worse before September.

        ” Instead of trench war, this century’s great war will mean barriers to trade and capital.”
I know little about armaments but this observation strikes me as portending the future of warfare. Each house and dwelling place a little entrepot although, in the long run, for how long before the Four Horeeman come crashing through the gates?
Sill, in terms of conventional warfare, why doesn’t Russian air power bomb the roads making travel and delivery of goods and supplies to population centers difficult if not impossible and isolating Ukraine’s military personnel?

            Seems pretty obvious, as they intend it to remain a functioning country when it ends. I doubt they want 40 million refugees on their border when its over.
Unlike the US or NATO who just don’t mind wrecking the entire country, as its future is of no concern.20 million refugee Iraqis or Syrians is of no consequence to those making the decisions.

            “in terms of conventional warfare, why doesn’t Russian air power bomb the roads making travel and delivery of goods and supplies to population centers difficult if not impossible and isolating Ukraine’s military personnel?”Short answer-they have chosen not to, at this time. That’s the same answer as to why the Russians have not closed those corridors into Kiev, Karkhov, or Maripol with artillery, either (which Ivan is very, very strong in). All three of those cities are now well within the range fan of Russian artillery. Americans in particular, and Western Europeans, are enamored of and think of war as primarily “bombs away” since 1944. The Russians have opted for a more balanced approach.However, if they choose, they can mass artillery and rake Kiev with regimental mass TOT fire or shake and bakes, or cover the supply routes into aforesaid cities with DPICM, any time they want.

            The Russians are trying to preserve the infrastructure as much as possible to win hearts and minds.
There are also rumors that they need the roads because they’ve been ordered to stay out of the fields as much as possible to avoid affecting the spring planting.

One of them was obese, and two of the remaining three wanted to leave him. But the third man was a friend of the fat guy, and insisted they include him.Fast-forward to a few months later, when the four men finally arrived back at civilization: the three men who started out fit were down to skin and bones; while the guy who started out fat was faring much better.So you never can tell….

                    Maniac:  We’re considering what to do with both our 401k and IRA accounts.  Old enough that ‘merely’ confiscatory taxes apply rather than additional penalties, but more concerned with future governmental assimilation/digitalization.  And inflation eating away an additional % each month is also a concern.  I’m old enough to get SS but it would be entirely eaten up by taxes and transferred to Shaniqua because my husband’s current salary means we’re wypipo taking more than our fair share.

                    Back in ’09 when I was “outsourced” by my employer, I had already lost all trust in the banking larceny system and its insistence on penalizing me for taking possession of my own money.  I quickly concluded that something was better than nothing, cashed out, and paid those outrageous taxes + penalties.  I’m happier for it, and haven’t participated in any “201k” schemes since.

                    You can borrow from it usually. Sorta act to stretch out your exposure.  You can also withdraw it and replace it within a year with no penalties for health or other reasons. The year can be extended.  I’m no finance guy so don’t take that to the bank.

        “the Russians have had the chance to test their S-400 surface-to-air missile system against serious opposition. It turns out to be as lethal as advertised, able to take out aircraft from over 250-miles away.”Which betrays the utter stupidity and recklessness of the idiots calling for a “no-fly zone.”A no-fly zone would involve shooting down Russian combat aircraft. Of course, those Russian aircraft are supporting Russian ground troops — who have and are naturally going to use SAMs to take out the NATO aircraft destroying their air cover. The NATO response would then be to target the ground troops with the SAMs — and bingo, you’ve escalated into a full-blown war against the Russian military.If I’m just a keyboard warrior and I can figure this out over a cup of coffee in the morning, why can’t the geniuses in the State Department, the Pentagon, and the Senate Foreign Affairs Committe understand it?

            Where would these NATO planes enforcing the no fly zone be based?I’ve read that one of the reasons that the Russians have failed to,establish air supremacy over Ukraine is that NATO is fly AWACS in the vicinity and giving the information to the Ukrainians.   Open hostilities would lead to those AWACS being targeted and drive off one way or another, which would improve the Russians situation on the short term.  And then where exactly would the planes fly from to engage the Russians?  I’m unaware of any major US airbases in the vicinity.  Moving several carrier groups into the Black Sea would be very risky to say the least.

        Guided missiles are having the revolutionary impact on warfare that firearms had in the 15th century.  And like that example will take a century or so to fully develop.Firearms upended the military paradigm that had existed for millennia.  Armor became obsolete.  So did fixed fortifications. And pre existing military expertise.  It took a decade of training and a huge investment in resources to field an army of mounted knights, or on the steppe one of mounted archers.  Castles and fortified towns were enormously expensive in time and material and required entire a high level of economic and culture focus to achieve.   All literally blown away in a century by minimally trained men with explosive black powder.

            The interesting byproduct of the tech revolution in armaments is that we are returning to an older form of war. In the second Chechen war, the Russians adapted by using special units to clear one building at a time in an up close and personal way. They are using the same tactics in Ukraine. It takes longer and it is bloodier, but the alternative is carpet bombing cities and towns. We are also seeing the Russians use the old fashioned tactic of encirclement. Again, this is bloody, but it works to starve out an entrenched defender.The thing is, the West is incapable of this brand of fighting. We simply lack the will to lose that many soldiers to gain territory.

                The boomerwaffen on the normiecon sites (see Steve Green at PJMedia) are all high fiving each other about a report that the Russians have lost 10000 to 15000 KIA. None of these smooth brains ever seem to wonder why we are not hearing any breathless reports of UKR casualties. One of the more neutral analysts I have been watching on youtube was very skeptical of this number as it would exceed the casualty rate of some of the most bloody battles in WWII. He pointed out also that if that number WAS real it was highly likely that the UKR had suffered the same amount if not more considering the huge advantage in artillery and ground attack aircraft/missiles the Russians have.Reading these guys reminds me of the opening scene of “Gone With the Wind” where the southern plantation owner society party is interrupted by the announcement of the shelling of Fort Sumpter. They all cheered and proclaimed they would “Whoop them Yankees and be back home for Christmas!”

                        Agreed. If that number was real, the internet would be filled with high-def video footage of massive, WW2-style tank battles. Instead we see undated footage of the occasional blown-out tank or dead infantryman.
Honestly, I think the public (certainly the media) are disappointed there’s not *more* bloodshed.

                    ” … a report that the Russians have lost 10000 to 15000 KIA.”And this in spite of the fact that Western media reported 130,000 Russian troops in the whole action. The 15,000 figure would be KIA of more than 10%, and that ignores wounded and missing. The casualties would be higher than in any war in human history. But there you are–TV mediates reality for MOST Westerners.

                The West doesn’t need    more territory and there is no one to occupy it.  Invade say Canada and what? Give it to the Amish? Sure we could increase our standard of living by looting but any decent resistance can make resource extraction incredibly costly.No babies means no need for lebansraumThe Russia/Ukraine  situation is unusual in that Russia is basically  trying to take land occupied by ethnic Russians in lieu of having more babies  and some other areas to shore up borders and along the way shank the USIf China went into Taiwan it would be for similar reasonsThis doesn’t mean war will stop only that its going to be border skirmishes, small wars civil wars and the like as it was through most of history.Depending on how long it goes on after the “desperation wars” like this one are done  , we should see less large scale warfare simply because no people, no problem.

                I’m not sure he will need them. The hypersonic missiles like Kalibr and Khinjal   while not truly hypersonic appear to work really well and Russia has nuclear payloads as needed.
Standoff weapons than artillery than air support than finally the rest rather than massed tank battles.

                i predict a counter that works by detecting an incoming javelin, then launching something akin to a depth charge, that explodes away from the tank, in the path of the javelin.

                    There are videos of such weapons in development and testing.  Whether they are deployed or not, I do not know.  But I’ve seen the tests—assuming you can believe anything from the MIC.

                    Yep; that is exactly what the new Gen 4 armour on the T14’s purports to do.
I can see a variant of the Patriot missile concept adapted to tanks to…

                Yes and the Javs are also designed to attack the weakest part of a tank, the top. Typically very little armor is used (due to weight generally) on the top surface of the turret. This design cannot be changed or augmented without completely redesigning the tank itself.Combined with 80%+ hit rate of a fire and forget system, this is incredibly devastating for armored columns, especially when they are not skilled in practicing combined arms maneuver to reduce the threat of anti-armor systems.There are more advanced reactive systems created to defeat ATGMs at a greater stand-off distance, but the Russians don’t really have any that work or have them in any numbers.(Former USMC 0352 here, this tank/anti-tank warfare is giving me a chub…)
