        I found you when you did some brilliant work about Donald Sterling and the forced sale of the L.A. Clippers.  I never saw your take printed anywhere else in the media, and it was the only explanation that actually made sense.  I frequently use your work to help me sort out the crazy things I see out there in the world these days, and I consider you one of the most valuable reads on the net.  Thank you!

        Like Quick‚Äôs joint ana specific number of others, Da Z is a daily stop.  The similarites are hardly stunning- you, like the others I read, simply cut through the crap and tell it like it is.
That is a rare commodity online these days.  Thank you ‚Äìjb

            I seldom add a comment here as I think this should only be done if one can actually move the dialog forward.‚ÄùAttaboy‚Äù or ‚Äúamen‚Äù just takes up space.But you have raised the subject with this post which allows me to thank you wholeheartedly for the site. The filters at work recently decided that you were a blog and accordingly your site is blocked, although scores of other blogs are not blocked. This pisses me off exceedingly as I liked to check throughout the workday to read comments and catch your new posts ‚Äúhot off the presses‚Äù.Forty five thousand regulars is good, but I think that your writing deserves a much wider readership. If you do not accept funding please accept kudos.

            I have a thing about paid opinion writers, even the independent ones that I like.  I‚Äôd rather read the real, unbidden thoughts of a man under no obligation to do so. It has the air of authenticity that few can manage.  You andThe Woodpile Reportare two such.

        Well, I don‚Äôt think that comments are a good indication of readership. I have tried to comment at Breitbart using my cell phone and it almost never works. I‚Äôve commented at Ace (which I seldom read these days) and Vox Day. The commenting system at Ace is also very strange. I don‚Äôt make any effort to promote my two blogs as they are basically vanity blogs.
I enjoy blogs where the comments are intelligent. I seem to find more of that here.

        I have very much enjoyed your blog and the various ‚Äúdiscussions‚Äù with some of your readers. Being one of the few ‚Äòauslanders‚Äô on here, it is always a pleasure to argue points from a German, if not European point of view.
Only one recommendation for improvement ‚Äì please‚Ä¶if possible, can you look into an edit feature. I believe many would ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù on this request.
Otherwise, well done as always. Keep up the good work.

            Readers wanting to make a contribution is a different thang.  We know people have expenses and it takes time and money to put up a site, so what‚Äôs the problem with wanting to give back a small amount that is not under compulsion?  It‚Äôs not money grubbing if you can choose to donate or not.  Of course, if someone is independently wealthy, they could simply not address the issue.

        Congrats Z-man.A parable:There was a man who grew tired of a group of kids playing in his front yard every day.  In spite of him asking them to leave, they would always return the next day.  He tried everything from signs to yelling at them to no avail. He bought a dog to chase the kids away but the kids taught the dog to play fetch instead.  Finally, one morning the man had an idea.  When the kids came back to play in his yard he went out to them and offered them a deal:  He told them from now on he would pay them to play in his yard.  The first day he paid them fifty cents each.  The next day he paid them seventy-five cents each.  The next day, a dollar, and so forth.  Eventually, to the kids, playing in the man‚Äôs yard became like work.  And, gradually, less and less kids showed up until one day, the man looked out upon his front yard and all the kids were gone.Moral of the story:  To play is eternal.  To work is external.  The money is neutral.  Whatever we do, we must keep it real and when in doubt, stay pure.

                Thanks much, Zman.  I installed it, and now I‚Äôm waiting for it to get enough data (I presume) to provide accurate reports.  Out of the box, it showed I had two unique visitors on a daily average for the past month.  Now, while this would thrill some of my detractors, it‚Äôs a bit hard to reconcile with the blog itself, unless those two unique readers have posted hundreds of comments under hundreds of different names and verified accounts.
Once it‚Äôs firing on all cylinders, it looks like it will be quite useful, though.

                    I recall experiencing the same thing. I‚Äôve had it installed for a about a year, but I have just started looking at the numbers so I suspect it will take a while to get meaningful data.

            Check out WP SlimStats too, Bill. Just sent you an e-mail about it. I used to use it way back when, it‚Äôs quite good.

        You are valuable and unique.  Stay that way.  And be careful how you compare yourself.  E.g. Vox Day mixes issues with his penchant for gaming and sci-fi stuff.  I don‚Äôt like having to parse through all that crap (not important to me).

                And I don‚Äôt believe in PayPal.  Same-same, instrument of the man.  They are like Facebook and will shut you down because of your opinions.  They did this to Ann Barnhardt.
