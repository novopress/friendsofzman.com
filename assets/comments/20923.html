        Being a modern dissident requires you to deny the legitimacy of corrupt and failed institutions like the U.S. government, both political parties, the judicial system, federal and much of local law enforcement, mainstream media, academia, big business and  the hierarchies of every established church, Catholic and Protestant.You have to deconstruct your entire existing worldview and deny almost every cultural legacy that has emerged since WWII, including conventional views of history, heroes, villains, who you are supposed to trust in tough times and what you’re supposed to do to protect yourself and your family.Most of the rogues’ gallery Z lists above are grifters but the vast majority of those who support the grift are people who buy their hopium simply because replacing your entire worldview is much harder than clinging and coping for another day.People are clinging to the floating wreckage of America.  There’s no future in it but they’re afraid to swim for something better.  They have to realize how precarious their present existence is and want something better bad enough to let go.

            It’s tough to acknowledge that something you love is dying. That’s the case with most White Americans. It’s our job to gently show them that it’s already dead and that they need to move on.

                Lots of upvotes. It is very difficult to let go. Even as recently as twenty-five years ago when the handwriting already was on the wall, this was a beautiful country. People are migrating our way and almost never the reverse but we need to acknowledge how painful it is for them.

                It was a good run but time to move on and start planning for the futureI went through total heartbreak at a young age in my first marriage.  Had my first kid at 18.  Then his mom dumped me after a few years.  That was more painful than America telling me I am no longer wanted.  I spent years fretting over this demographic shit, gave my heart to this place, and for what?  It’s just another corporation that is now restructuring and getting rid of its old employees and bringing in the new batch.  And it will blow the same smoke up their ass, promise them future ownership shares, string them along, and then toss them aside in a few generations.But anyway, yes, it’s hard to accept that what I thought and believed was actually a nation and that by birthright I was part owner turned out to be lies.

            People are clinging to the floating wreckage of America. There’s no future in it but they’re afraid to swim for something better.I think also they don’t see anything around them to swim too and the storms getting worse… We have to be the lighthouse for them and even though it might risk our lives row out to save the ones who are worth it…

            A good indicator of “letting go” would be a low White turnout this coming November.  With so much at stake, not showing up would be a good indicator that Whites no longer see the system as legitimate and workable. This would put the ’85ers back onto the center of the conservative stage to sing their tone deaf tunes…and it would feed into the prejudices of the anti-whites in seeing this as a moral victory. They would then ratchet up their war on Whites believing that the death of Conservative, Inc. had washed away all opposition.  As an example in California there is no White political power. The UC system is now rapidly expanding its NAM infiltration of every campus. The incoming freshmen class is 40% NAMs, 35% Asian, 5% Black, 21% White. This is a 16% increase in NAMs over last year and this track will continue. Latinos are now the plurality. Fewer Whites doesn’t mean they let up. It means they accelerate because there is no one to stop them. The state and the UC system were 75% White not that long ago.  This is the fate fence sitters and foot-dragging goodWhites need to contemplate.Whites finding themselves without a Great White Hope would have to focus their energy within their own circles to deal with a position without a defender.  From what we are beginning to observe white agitation is increasing.  At some point forms of reorganizing will occur. By nature and by nurture.  Not all of it will go our way. Some goodWhite will boil off our way and most of them will not be urbanites.  Suburbs that are mostly White but vote blue^2…will want to remain White. They will whine and counter-signal endlessly…but in act they will do whatever is necessary to keep their communities White.  Don’t ignore word, but watch deed more carefully.By nature people move our way. Neither by nature nor nurture do they move from our side the opposite.  Their ranks will seek more extreme measures but they will not grow significantly.  Our enemies have given them no place to go.A lot of opportunities are already falling into our laps. Let’s not let a good thing go to waste.

                I suspect a ton of white WANVOWOOT (we are not voting our way out of this) is coming this fall.  I’m one of them. I don’t particularly crave accelerationism, but it is a side effect of figuring out what is most important now, and voting is not part of it.  I see voting as a form of denying the reality of the situation we find ourselves in.Just because Trump got elected once and stirred the pot, doesn’t mean he gets elected a second time or accomplishes anything in the next four years.  Without the Orange Man as a focus of Leftie anger, I suspect they will more aggressively turn on each other.  We live in an uncivil culture now; I want the incivility to be turned full bore on my enemies.  A focus on Trump is a crutch for us to not focus on our enemies, by waiting for him to do something.  A focus on Trump hides the fact that many Lefties are simply angry people.  If we can find a way to stay out of their sights, or make for a very determined and resolute enemy, they will turn on their own like a pack of hungry dogs.  Their anger doesn’t go away, it simply seeks weak targets.  If the typical Leftie is anything, he is a weak whiner and a fat target.

                    I don’t think it has to be mutually exclusive.  One can vote while not expecting much more than that one side is less harmful than the other.  In other countries that got to this point you would usually see each faction operating a political arm and a paramilitary arm.  A good example is Sinn Fein and the IRA.  SF was the political wing, the IRA, the paramilitary.  It was a way to more or less openly acknowledge that liberal democracy was a sham while not breaking cleanly enough from it that the State could anathematize everyone with certains views.  It also allowed one to go back and forth between the carrot of parliamentarianism and the stick of the gun as the situation warranted.  You also see this kind of political arrangement all over the ME or course.  The DR needs to keep always in mind that the goal is winning and abandoning your (admittedly weak and duplicitous) political wing before you have a credible militia and de facto homeland(s) doesn’t look much like winning to me.I agree that the GOP is a vile and traitorous organization but so is the Democratic Party.  Both parties are run, at the top, by the same group of globalists, (((banksters))), corporatists, and degenerates.  They gather strength by telling the various factions that make them up whatever lies they need to hear to keep the money and votes rolling in.  That doesn’t mean that a reformed GOP or a new party entirely could not be useful in providing political cover for our side much as the Dems’ political strength in many cities has allowed their radicals to operate outside the law.

            …clinging to the wreckage…YES. I’m swimming toward better right now and realize I don’t have answers for my kids about what’s coming. They are taking the unknown well and I see now the benefit to instilling core truths (convictions) in them, to give them the power to operate well in the coming years. This is contrasted by my nationalistic childhood. Unlearning (destroying normalcy bias) is important, too.It’s apparent to me now that educating my kids on what not to believe is a critical part of our homeschool. Helping them see clearly (and resist what the World says is true) is my main driver now.

            Exile,You are describing my journey down this road to a tee, Brother. Initially the slog was tough. My family have always been the American equivalent of the English “stout yeoman.” One of mine was given accolades from Gen. Washington for sneaking messages through enemy British lines in his colonial uniform. We’ve provided fighters for every war this country has had except those wherein we didnt have anyone old enough/too old to go.It’s been hard to divorce “nation” from “my people”. I literally went through all the stages of grief.Then the dawn broke. The nation/country divorced us. Ran around on us. Beat us. Lied to us and tricked us. Despised us and left us with a continuing torrent of hateful words.I’m done. The road and load have been so much lighter of late. The rapidly increasing  hate I see toward me and mine only lifts my heart. I ain’t get beaten or abused anymore.F**k em.

            Good analogy ,  but just swimming in the general direction of the island you see off in the distance – might prove out to be an extremely bad decision.  That island might be a mirage.  In fact I must admit to being surprised at how degraded some of the places I might have previously considered to be “better” than where I am currently in the northeast have become.I could have pulled up roots a few years ago and moved – only to find out I was now living on what was a mirage.Unless you’re a young drifter – wandering constantly is not in the purview of most people.  They are rooted to at least some degree in place by investment in infrastructure (house) and family and friends.

        Is anyone else up to snuff on the camouflaged federal agents hauling the Bioleninists off the streets in Portland? Take a peak at r/Politics on Reddit and witness seething like you’ve never seen before. One poster raged about 2A supporters (i.e., conservatives) failing to stand up to these evil kidnapping fascists. A younger me—and perhaps many of you here—might have once responded, “I disagree with your protesting, but I’ll defend to the death your right to do it!”But I’ve since learned that the globohomo left, from corporate CEOs and politicians on private jets to their mutant foot soldiers in the streets, want everything I love honor and cherish erased and dead. I further realize that the kitted-up agents are merely defending Federal installations and probably do not share our sour views toward their employer. Still, I responded to the enraged Redditor that no, we will not be coming to your defense, and that if a few of you pesky agitators are whisked away to unknown locations by some ex-soldiers and mercenaries, we are at best indifferent and maybe even quietly elated.I’m citing the Portland event because it’s so pertinent to the world in which the conservative now finds himself. This is war, and many of our old conservative/libertarian philosophies, chiefly that old notion ofwe’re all in this togethermust be abandoned.I feel confident in stating that many on our side want out ofthisaltogether.

            This is war. Absolutely correct, and recent events have helped me to advance this quite frank statement on a handful of centrists with a tacit acceptance on their part – who knows, they may see the light… Still working on them.When I was younger I pretty much thought the same, the whole freedom of speech thing. At some point I suspect we had reached the zenith of both responsible government (as good as it could be) and a responsible citizenry so maybe speech was freer and people were more robust – both physically and mentally. Still, that has gone and I’d quite like to operate in a society that didn’t perpetuate every vulgarity and stupidity going.

            A younger me—and perhaps many of you here—might have once responded, “I disagree with your protesting, but I’ll defend to the death your right to do it!”But I’ve since learned…Yep. I encountered a similar thing recently with regard to second amendment rights. A group called Black Guns Matter is painting itself as a pro 2nd amendment group. When the Minneapolis rioters started, the leader of the group went straight up and started trainingthe protestors.The Cuckservatives were falling all over themselves to praise this brave stand for civil rights and the second amendment. I countered that anyone who is arming and training my enemy is my enemy. I raised the uncomfortable specter of the ANC and the probable use put to widespread gun ownership and training in the hands of black activists.That wasn’t what the cuckservatives wanted to hear.

                You’re probably right – but………..  you have to also understand that the pro 2nd amendment crowd has been getting hammered on by the anti-gun crowd since before most of us were born.So – their logic is that – at least on that one topic – that anybody willing to carry a gun is their “friend”.I agree with them to a certain extent – because if Antifah and BLM both start carrying guns around (they already are) – well then they’re likely to either be as adamant about protecting that right as the “traditional” pro-2nd crowd has been – or –  they’ll become yet another example of the utter hypocrisy that the left engages in on a constant basis.Maybe the cuckservative types don’t see this – but I assure you that the hardcore pro-2nd amendment crowd has no illusions whatsoever about whether Antifah and BLM types are their “friends” – they know that they are NOT.Supporting Antifah and BLM in their gun ownership is a way of fracturing the leftist coalition – which has been able to rally all their disparate elements around the subject of gun control in the past.The problem I think they don’t see clearly – is that gun control in the past has always gotten more support when blacks and criminals are perceived as being too well armed.  Not sure if that dynamic is still in effect in the current day though – seeing as how Joe and Jane Normie seem to be arming themselves based on the recent gun sales numbers.

            I’ve tried to make the wife understand that this is already a civil war.  The other day, she asked me what I thought about the argument that wearing a mask can be thought of as an extension of the principles behind banning indoor smoking.  At first I pointed out that there’s a difference in the risks involved but ultimately I just told her right out – it’s a matter of tactics at this point.  You refuse the mask to encourage our side and show defiance of theirs.  You also want the masked cowards to see how many of us are not afraid of their bogeymen.  Some of the smarter ones will realize that people who don’t fear the Beer Flu probably also don’t believe in systemic racism or white privilege.As for the rioters getting pulled into cars.  I’ve lost all sense of fairness about them.  I don’t care about their freedoms.  I want them all to rot in Gitmo for the rest of their lives.  It obvious to me that order won’t really be restored until one side or the other is totally crushed.  Portland Leftists never understood or cared about “freedom of speech and assembly” anyway.  It was all just a tool to be discarded when it lost its usefulness.  They deserve nothing but the iron boot now.

            How about this?  We should demand the establishment of ‘a well-regulated’ militia (of race realists) in each state that would operate under defined rules of engagement.  They would be required to swear an oath to the Constitution and must wear a bodycam during all operations.  Unmarked cars are a red herring bull crap. A lesson needs to be learned so that it is never forgotten. Both violent protestors and any of the (mostly peaceful) thugs wearing helmets should be rounded up, thouroughly Covid-19 tested (with the long nasal swab), thoroughly biometrically categorized and photographed for future reference.  Then they should be placed in a fenced compound until the streets clear.

        I see Biden signs in my neighborhood. These are people with wealth and prestige putting the signs out. They can’t be stupid right?  Someone on the local Message Board the other day  asked whether people thought Biden had dementia. All the people just responded will so does Trump which is clearly untrue and irrelevant.  It seems like the corruption has gone all the way down into their house.

                Agreed. One of the biggest demoralizing shocks lately has been the nearly total support given to BLM by Corporate America. If Corporate America is to the left of Noam Chomsky, the situation might be beyond any conventional remedy.I was recently told by a first-generation immigrant that we are so lucky to have lived in the U.S. instead of Africa or South Asia. I fully agreed. But even so, it is hard to love a country whose elite is so openly hostile.By the way, I just finished the audio version of Chris Caldwell’s “Age of Entitlement”. Caldwell does a great job of showing how we got into this mess. Unfortunately, he could not provide any possible remedy other than abolishing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is impossible in the near term.

                    Compared to Africa or South Asia, “America” is okay for now. But it is spiraling downward so rapidly that living standards will approach those of the third world fairly soon, say within 20 years. Of course, by that time there will have been a civil conflagration of some sort.

                    I’m reading a book right now that’s a history of Russia up into the revolution. In 1874 the tsar ordered a review of the radical elements in Russian Society.  Here is a quote from the report by the Minister of Justice, Count Pahlen:” the investigation has shown that many no longer young persons –  fathers and mothers of families, well situated financially and holding honored positions in society- not only failed to oppose [the young revolutionaries] but, on the contrary offered them overt sympathy, aid and assistance. In their blind fanaticism they seem not to realize that the ultimate consequence of such actions would be the doom of society and of themselves”

                        The analogy to Russia is interesting. I understand that many inside and outside China were similarly oblivious to dangers of Mao immediately before the collapse of Chiang on the mainland. Ditto for Castro in Cuba.  People simply wanted change.

            Stockholm Syndrome.They identify with their oppressor in order to avoid persecution. Unless you’re dealing with a serial killer, one of the best ways to survive oppression is to get your oppressor to identify with you. That’s most easily accomplished when you identify with them and their cause. Thus the “but I’m on your side” refrain from white antifa kids a few weeks ago as BLM rioters assaulted them.This phenomenon also explains why Hispanics, Asians, and Jews will never majority vote republican (the White party): the GOP is on the losing side of history due to demographic change, and humans have evolved to pick the winner. It’s foolish for any of those “natural conservatives” to cast their lot with a losing party and risk being oppressed by the incoming strong horse. Everyone wants to be friends with the new boss, which is why Medieval princes were often courted (and feared) before coming to the throne; why make enemies of the future ruler?You’re here now because your parents were careful about not being ostracized from the larger group, which in the past often meant demographic annihilation. That implies most humans have a psychological disposition to sense which direction the social wind in blowing and set their ship to sail accordingly. Women are the most pronounced at this, but men do it as well.

            I’m surprised* at how shortsighted the Republican establishment is. Even if they don’t catch on to anything else regarding demographic transformation, it seems like they would realize (after a few decades) that the brown people don’t vote Republican. If nothing else, they won’t be able to win elections. I guess the current grifters get while the getting is good. They don’t worry, even in the most narrow and selfish sense, about the near future

        From Goad, Sunday:For one thing, we’re not sure why Confederate flags were permissible anywhere on US military bases in the first place, seeing as how the USA’s costliest war in terms of lives lost was the one where the USA defeated the Confederacy. It’s sort of like NATO forces allowing Nazi memorabilia—it simply doesn’t make much sense.Hey, Goad, maybe it’s because the lion’s share of the combat-capable troops in the US army come from former confederate states and shitting on what they regard as a mark of pride is pretty counter-productive.The Yankees in the war’s aftermath better understood the value of being magnanimous in victory than the morons drooling their opinions today.

Total fail. If Americans fought for anything in WWII, it was the right to collect whatever they goddamned please, up to, and including, shrunken heads.
And maybe I’ve been watching too many movies, but my impression is that Nazi memorabilia were, in fact, very popular with US troops in Europe.

                If there is admiration among military men – it’s not Nazi , but GERMAN. The military facts are that the Wehrmacht was in many cases a superior and extremely well run military organization. Their methods of organization and fighting strategies are still studied today.The Germans fought and won victories against vastly superior forces (based on numbers).And speaking as somebody who was born in the mid-60s – I can also say that people used to be FAR less hinky about the whole Nazi thing than they are now. As an elementary school kid I started reading books about WW2 – and drew pictures of tanks and swastikas on the brown paper bags that covered my school books. Nobody noticed – and nobody cared – and nobody sent me to the principal’s office or expelled me from school.As soon as the generation that was actually exposed to Nazism and lived thru it started to die off – the shrieking about Nazis started to increase exponentially. When Nazis marched thru Skokie the event was in the newspapers – and I remember thinking “if they did that here I would punch them” ( I was a kid) – but the fact is that they DID march – they DID fly the flag – and everybody went home afterwards without it being a world shattering event. The culture largely integrated this and moved on and just made fun of it (go watch the Blues Brothers movie for an excellent example).And I think  your “NATO allowing Nazi memorabilia” is off the mark.The truly screwed up thing would be having NATO allow USSR memorabilia.  That was the traditional NATO enemy – and the entire reason it came into existence in the first place.

            The US Civil War was Americans v Americans, and afterward there were still a lot of Confederate Americans that had to be integrated.  In other words, it was internal.
WWII was the world against Nazi Germany for the most part, and Nazi Germany was conquered from without.  NATO is not Germany.  To make your analogy more appropriate, it would be like the US allowing California or Texas to fly Mexican flags . . . oh, wait.

He can’t get his mind around the totality of what the Flag meant for southerners. At a minimum, you would think he’d be able to understand that it was something they could rally around and bond with after everything they knew was turned to ash and rubble.   One only has to be a human to get that.

Hey Falcone. I picture us meeting up in some Hollywood bar like we plan to. We’re drinking and getting along great. Then the deeper we get into Dissident politics the more we realize we’re not so alike. We end up arguing. Then actually fighting. Management and bouncers start dragging us out. We instinctively combine forces and beat them down. Then we’re friends again and end the night eating corn dogs at Pink’s.

            The reason it was tolerated was to diminish the after effects of the war and to enforce the idea that we were one people. Its the same reason that Confederates were rarely tried for treason.Not only was in not treason but there was risk of perpetual insurgency. Imagine every Northerner of any import got  the Lincoln treatment.And sure the North could try and Sherman’ March the whole of the South. This would have increased the number of insurgents.Its not much fun to be rich and powerful  when the war never stopped.The current ban is meant to say “we are one people regardless of placed of birth” but our leaders having less reasoning power than a twelve year old ended up sending “we hate you and what you stand for” instead thus doing the opposite.

                The current ban is meant to say “we are one people regardless of placed of birth” but our leaders having less reasoning power than a twelve year old ended up sending “we hate you and what you stand for” instead thus doing the opposite.
You will never convince me the latter isn’t exactly what they meant all along. I don’t believe they ever intended the former.

But we are NOT one people. The US is a collection of warring tribes, all of whom hate each other; it’s just an economy, nothing more. This flag thing is the kind of desperation move a failing empire makes. Truthfully, attacks on “Confederates” are just racist dog whistles against Whites. Biden is now saying he’s going to put up the LGBTQA flag on military bases. Do you need more evidence these bigots are just signalling against you?

                        None whatsoever but I’ve long been of the belief that none of the problems the US faces are resolvable by any means other than violence on a massive scale.At that point one faction will either have total control or the nation will fracture.
Otherwise its just going to slowly fall apart into a Leftists pesthole.

                The Civil War death toll was very high compared to other wars that the US has been in.From the interwebs:===============It remains the deadliest war in American history. From 1861 to 1865, it is estimated that620,000to750,000soldiers died, along with an undetermined number of civilians. By one estimate, the war claimed the lives of 10 percent of all Northern men 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white men aged 18–40.===============According to some of the hits I found on WW1 – the British death toll there was about 700,000.1911 British census showed 43 million peopleJust before the Civil War the US population was about 31.5 million.So the Civil War death toll was higher as a percentage than WW1 was for the British.There has been much written about how WW1 “decimated” Britain because of the high losses – you think the same wasn’t true for the US?Sooner or later you start running out of troops.  The North solved this problem with immigrants and negro soldiers.I don’t recall any history being written about what the US was like near the end of the Civil War ,  but the history is full of accounts of the US population getting sick and tired of WW2 near the end – and that was a factor that was accounted for when the atomic bomb was being considered for dropping on Japan.  The politicians were feeling the heat already in 1945 – and the invasion of Japan was estimated to cause a million casualties or more.I’ve got to imagine that both the North and the South populations were damn well sick and tired of the war near the end.  Much more people lived on farms back then – and when you kill of the strong backs (men) – everybody else suffers DIRECTLY.They couldn’t just go on WIC or SNAP or get an EBT card.  The man is dead – everybody else suffers and maybe even dies.

                    You really only need enough production to feed your own people though and 10% losses even with the fairly low efficiency farming techniques of that era produced enough surplus.I think it was more economics. The Yankees of that period, Damned and otherwise were obsessed with trade and commerce and the sooner a subdued South could be brought back into the fold and any risk of insurgency gone, the faster they could get back to extracting money.

        This is what happens to a political movement that, on social issues, is entirely defensive posturing. Every defeat moves the posturing leftward and every victory is just a lack of moving leftward.A fine example is the courts. Activist left wing judges constantly overturn previous court rulings with abandon and “right wing” judges uphold the new rulings using the concept of Stare Decisis. The Civil Rights Act of 1965 was a rerun of a 70 or 80 year old law (at the time) that was passed making it illegal for businesses to discriminate on account of race. The SCOTUS overturned the law based on property rights and freedom of association. The left completely ignored Stare Decisis and upheld the law, but the conservatives refused to overturn previous activist left wing court’s rulings.This is why it is a one way ratchet forever moving left.

        Although not as frequent, it happens on the left too.  Leftists stuffed the ballot box with immigration with the thought that they’d finally get their Scandinavian paradise, only to end up staring down the barrel of terror by Brownunism.  They hide behind their Orange Man Bad memes and pussy hats as if that garbage means anything to child-molesting tyrants who rule over them.

                And yet that shock of getting off the train in Somalia instead of Stockholm never seems to inspire them to abandon that train. Or even question the direction of the tracks. Instead, its just a million shades of “the real bullet train to utopia just hasn’t been done yet.” This is part of why Real Progress demands destroying history; pulling up the tracks behind them helps resolve the dissonance of waiting for real progress. The comfort of knowing that Paris has always looked like Dakar is just around the next bend.

            Yep, I’ve noticed my liberal friends/family members retreating ever deeper into fantasy land, much more so than my CivNat friends/family, many of whom seem to be waking up to various degrees.
White liberals truly believed that their black, brown and yellow mercenaries would fall in line behind them once the hated Badwhites were defeated. As it’s becoming clear that the mercenaries are taking control, White progressives are adopting the anti-White rhetoric to convince themselves that this is what they always wanted. They can’t admit – even to themselves – that they made a huge mistake.

                Many if not most White Progressives are a lost cause, the same with many CivNats. Peeling off enough, and it is happening without much effort, can produce a winning hand even now. We just have to let go of the institutions that failed us, although they should be exploited when the opportunity arises to gain advantage, for example, stoking anger among Christians as their churches are torched.

                It is ironic but the badwhites are better equipped to deal with the “black, brown, and yellow” mercenaries anyways. Tribalism is the most important factor, followed by street smarts, the firearm ownership, fertility, geographic location, etc.
Not to mention an average badwhite doesn’t necessarily have a poor relationship with non-whites. It is the white progressives that almost everyone hates.
It is absolutely getting very ugly very fast for the white liberals.

That’s the most amusing part of all of this. White progressives have no clue how despised they are in the Coalition of the Fringes. They truly believe that they are welcomed and loved.
The truth is that gentile White progressives have no home, no side to fall back on. They will find out soon enough that they’re the odd man out.

                The thing I notice with leftie people I am acquainted with – is that they seem to think that they are all more “moral” than the rest of us – and they’ve fully embedded the “no more Nazis!!” thing into the world view and psyche.The trick is to short circuit that somehow and insert a bug into their system they can’t process.  Since the whole Nazi thing seems to really drive them in a lot of ways – I use that as a go-to.Let’s say you’re in a conversation with a leftie.  And you bring up all the rioting and other assorted mayhem.  Ask them if they think the average person is going to stand for that for very long.  You can say things like “look – people want some sort of order – and they’re willing to put up with a lot of things to get it, without order they simply can’t lead their lives – raise their kids – go to their jobs – etc,  order WILL BE ENFORCED – and people will bet on a dark horse if that is what it takes to get there”.Then you can say ” the other law of society is – if you raise taxes too far – there WILL be rebellion,  you can add in the fact that people will naturally resent paying for things that they do not support or that actively attack them”.Then the leftie will start saying things like “I’m not really sure what you’re getting at”.Reply:  “Ok – here is what I am getting at.  The United States is friggin broke.  Anybody who pays attention to the national debt knows this – there are some rules you can bend and stretch pretty far here – but sooner or later budgetary reality catches up with the country that tries to break those rules.  That’s the first point.The second point is that order WILL be enforced. And by that I mean order for ‘normal’ people.  They need to raise their kids and hold their jobs and all that stuff.  So what I’m getting at here is that history seems to be having a nice big rhyming session right now.  What is happening in the US has a lot of rhyming verses with what happened in Germany after WW1 and into the Weimar Republic. Total monetary irresponsibility.  Perversions of all sorts – and now we actually have commies in the streets.  Sooner or later – I predice what we’re going to get is something akin to Nazis right here in the US.  Because that is what will be REQUIRED to enforce order.  It’s plainly obvious the left wing isn’t going to do it.So how does it feel to be a Nazi enabler?  Because YOU are supporting all the crap that is bringing about the conditions that will allow a Nazi-ish party to rise and gain power.  That would make all of this YOUR FAULT.I hope you’re proud of yourself!”The key is to not come at the whole thing like a Trump supporting right winger – but rather somebody who is potentially sympathetic to the cause of the left.  They just can’t wrap their minds around that.I made a hippie cry doing this before.  At least she was smart enough to understand where I was coming from.

        1985 was a nice year.  One of the many big differences with 2020 is how much easier it is to spot the bullshit now.  Because – the left is so much further left (without the Cold War to limit their embrace of socialism), the cucks like Williamson are in an obvious empty middle. Trump has a talent for revealing them too although he seems to do little about them.  And nice people like the Z-Man helpfully point out their crap to people like me who weren’t always paying attention.

                It’s understandable, particularly at this period in history. For a typical White American to acknowledge our current reality is disconcerting at best and, likely, terrifying. We’re about to become a despised minority in this country, the ramifications of which could be pretty bad.Easier to withdraw into fantasy land and hope for the best.That said, anecdotal evidence in my life shows that a number of White men (and even some White women) are waking up – at least somewhat. They’re still in that confused stage, trying to figure out what’s going on, but they’re beginning to realize that the other side is pulling a fast one on them, that they never wanted only “equal opportunity” and a colorblind society. They want power.Even my liberal friends/family are showing signs of stress, though, in their case, it manifests in their going all in on BLM, White privilege, etc. They’re retreating even farther into fantasy land because reality isn’t what they expected.

                        Just took some time off. Had some interesting observations during my sojourn in the hinterland. Never seen so many political discussions. Whites can feel that something is wrong, that the deal they were promised isn’t the deal that they’re getting.But the opposite is true as well. The White progressives – especially young White women – are going all in with the Narrative.Lines are being drawn in a way that I haven’t seen before. What’s more, Badwhites seem more and more willing to walk away, often times, literally, as in leave the country. Hell, even Goodwhites talk of leaving the country. Neither side seems to think of the USA as their country anymore, which is interesting.Hard to put my finger on it exactly, but something is changing in the minds of many Whites.

                            It’s funny. Everyone feels the effects of demographic change, but too few have the balls to talk about it, or even to conceive of it.    ‘This isn’t America anymore’ is as close as most will get.  That needs to change, or it’s over.

                    I have noticed this too. First of all, any talk of demographic transformation produces a massive mental block in most whites. They just shut down. Can’t blame them, it’s hard to accept that there are powerful forces out there trying to genocide us.To accept this also means that their entire life has been a lie – a life built around tolerance and being nice to minorities.All whites know something is going wrong, be it left, right, or normie. White women sense this, and BLM is a subconscious effort to stay on the right side.I should also add that many, many smarter non-whites know something is wrong too. Most smarter Indians didn’t come to Canada to be debt slaves, living 20 in a house, neighbors the same idiots as back home. Everyone is just kind of living, uneasily, pretending that everything is fine.

But they still feel the storm coming.

                            Do you ever think that what we are feeling is what Americans in late 1800s/ early 1900s felt when all of those immigrants were pouring in ?Granted, there are differences; racially, for example, those immigrants had a better chance of eventually blending in.But I’m talking more about the general feeling of just wanting to get away and the frustration and anger of having to uproot in the process, on one hand, or having to fight them for work on the other.And, similarly, the country was transformed then.  There was a big shake out.  People went this way and that and started anew.  All the pieces were moved all around the board.  And I have to wonder if the two World Wars were what was needed to create an environment wherein those pieces could all work together.

                                Absolutely, it is very similar to what the primarily British descended population experienced from 1875-1920.  I do genealogy, and have read a ton of old newspapers (looking for people’s names, marriages, deaths, etc.).  I have numerous clips about ‘a typical night in the Italian quarter’ where x knifed y, or kids not going to school, or petty theft, etc.  On the one hand, one reads of parades on church holy days (sort of like the scene in the Godfather) and while I can admire the adherence of tradition and religious beliefs, I can also utterly sympathize with the area’s previous residents who saw themselves being swamped by these newcomers who seemed totally alien.Although both my husband and I are the descendants of immigrants from the 1880s, we both agree that in general, none of our ancestors should have been allowed in.

                                    I agree on your latter point.   I’m Catholic, and I can see where it was a mistake to let in so many Catholics and how it disrupted the system the Protestants and the people here had come up with.  Plus my family is from Italy, but our situation is a little unique because my great-grandparents came to Tampa and New Orleans and are way different than the typical Guido types from New York.  Even I can’t tolerate those people.   I can see where at the actual human level it was a mistake; no one wants to move into a neighborhood and mess it up for everyone, or at least I don’t, and a lot of people probably the same.    But then as now, no one asked these normal Americans what they wanted, but the money people and the government wanted immigrants, and they got them.I guess same thing is happening now but the roles have changed.Anyway, no real point here, just sorta shooting the breeze 😉

                                        Actually, Falcone, I do think you have a point – and an important one.  Too many can’t see past their own family or personal interests.  Everyone holds up the various exceptions  (by race, religion, etc.) who claim to support ‘western civilization’ as these wonderful allies.  What they don’t understand, though, is that most of these exceptions only support it because it has been goodfor them or their own people.Not one of them supports it as a good in its own right, deserving to exist even if they are not a part of it.

                                            Falcone – 2nd point. One of the reasons US businesses were screaming for immigration and labor from 1875 on was because 600,000 men were slaughtered over the kneegrow question.  In this case they legitimately did need workers.  And poor peasant farmers from Italy and Ireland were delighted to come work in factories or dig ditches or carry bricks, despite the wages and working conditions. In exchange they got food and schooling for their children who no longer all died of disease, etc.

                                            Understood.But western civilization, the blood that flows through Italy and Europe is mine.  And even where they aren’t “my” people, say in England, we have a lot in common and I’m sure very distant relatives, and they learned from us and vice versa.  There was a lot of fighting, sure, but also a lot of taking and giving, say in the arts, culturally.  So they are much like my adopted family.  And America used to be that.  It was part blood relatives and part adopted parents.And what we all know what eventually happened and how people with no connection to us were married into the family or bought them out.  And before I could make sense of it all, we have Chuck Schumer sitting at the head of the table and the kid next to me is spinning a dreidel.  Then I go upstairs and my room is locked and no one will tell me why.But, I honestly have been through worse.  Chuck Schumer selling me out is about on par with getting fired from a summer job.  We all have our lives ahead of us to live.  Yeah it sucks we have to start from scratch and that Chuckie and Co have finagled their way into what used to be my home and gave me the boot.  But again, I have been through much worse.It’s time to remember who your real friends are, and your family, and figure out where we go from here.

                                There was more open space and most lived outside of the cities.  Average American was under less pressure then, so I imagine they chafed less too. In the cities, sure, I bet they hated it.

                        There are big regional differences in terms of general attitude and degree of frustration.
People in California for example have been screaming at whites in the midwest for years.  Decades.  Warning them what was coming.  But nothing.  Waved us off.
But it took a while for the process to spread to their regions and states.  Now what they are going through is what we have already gone through and are, I think, into the next stage already.

                        In my last job (high tech) – I worked with an Indian (India) guy and a Filipino.  Both were nice enough people – and for the most part kept their politics to themselves, the Indian guy especially.This was probably 4 years ago now – but one day they overheard a few of us white guys talking political stuff – and heard a few remarks about immigration.  They both came over – because BOTH of them just could not wrap their heads around why the US government wouldn’t defend the damn border.They had both come here “legally” and gone thru all of the hoops they had to jump thru to do it.  So to them the thought that somebody could just jump the border and be accepted with open arms was just obscene.  They also both made the remark “this kind of thing just simply wouldn’t be tolerated back where I came from”.  The Indian guy was even against the birthright citizenship thing – because he had kids born here and said that trying to bring them back to India would cause issues since they were both US citizens – simply by virtue of being  born here.So yeah – even the non-whites know something is screwed up here.

                            No such thing as ‘legal’ immigration. Take it from a former visa officer. Theyalllie, forge papers, claim assets they don’t have, claim strangers as relatives, etc. etc. Every last one of them lied or dodged the rules in some way (even as lenient and f-d up as the ‘rules’ are today). I would stake my life on that.

                            I have met Indians who shared that Indian’s concern about immigration. One I know even feels that immigrants should not be able to vote until the third generation. However, they all diligently vote democratic even if they are theoretically independents. They see Republicans as the racist party. The democrats have done a good job at demonizing Republicans and positioning the democrats as being the party of non white immigrants. Despite all their talk about being Americans, they are first and foremost a member of their tribe.

                This devolves into generational politics too. Alot of the worst cucks are our age – mid 50’s and up, and the thought of losing all that free stuff they voted for themselves back in the 70’s and 80’s…? You won’t be selling any red pills with that crowd. Most of them still believe the crap they read in the media too…

                    Old people and for many people , 55 is senior territory cannot and will not change.Its why in the past we had formal and informal age restrictions on many jobs and why a DR society will have a rule that ends political participation by the mid 60’s or 70.I will say though, someone sixty and under didn’t vote themselves anything in the 80’s. He or she was in their twenties at that time and had little to no political power.The shittiest generation aka the Silents were highly in charge and Ronnie Raygun lead the way.

                    If you’re in your mid-50’s now – well then you weren’t voting yourself shit back in the 70s because you were too young to even vote.  And in the 80s – even if you were voting age – you probably weren’t voting yourself anything then either because  you were either in college or just out of it and trying to find a job.I’m in my mid 50s now and really didn’t really start paying attention to politics until I was in my late 20’s and realized that “politics” was screwing me over on a constant basis. So I was almost out of the 80s entirely before I really started paying any attention to politics.  And of my circle of friends and acquaintances back then – which probably would number up around 100 or more – I don’t recall one single person who was a raving political loon, on the level that you see so many young people exist at now.Which free stuff are you referring to?  I worked my whole life – and I’m still working.  There was nothing that was “free” about it.

                    A lot of them are going to die over the next decade, just as all the POC take over the Democrat establishment.  I used to think that predictions of a crash or breakup by 2035 were a bit premature; now I truly wonder if we’ll make it that far.  Barring a crash or split, life (as remembered by those of us from a primarily White America) will be dramatically harsher.

                        According to Martin Armstrong – we’ll probably be lucky to make it to 2032, and the real descent will start at the next election cycle:https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/politics/nobody-will-accept-2020-election-result/——————–COMMENT:Mr. Armstrong; Socrates deserves a Nobel Prize for it is the only thing to forecast so many trends correctly. Now the news is thatTrump may not accept the election results. I have followed you for years. You are certainly not one of these people who make one forecast and run ads as the guy who forecasts something once so listen to him. I do hope you can bring this public. We really need to preserve the ability of Socrates to make these forecasts to preserve our future.JWREPLY:This election is a mess. The Democrats are in an all-out war to get rid of Trump to usher in this global Socialist agenda because everything is collapsing. They have promised states that if they maintain lockdowns to overthrow Trump, they will bail them out since they will lose nearly one year’s worth of tax revenue. Allowing voting without photo ID when you cannot get on a plane without one is the ultimate corruption, right in your face.NEITHERside will accept the election result. There is a verySTRONGpossibility this entire mess ends up in the Supreme Court. These tweaks to the election rules instigated by the Democrats are all designed to further civil unrest, for they know Joe Biden is incompetent and this is all about bailing out socialism and to restrict capitalism exempting only the super-rich who bribe them for special status. So this will put a cloud over the election just to disrupt the country again.This Private Wave began 1985.65. Trump was elected in 2016 which came in 31.4 years (Pi) into this wave which was 2017.05 (Jan 19th, 2017). Trump was sworn on January 20, 2017, at 12:00 PM EST. The turning point 2015.75 marked the peak in government confidence and negative interest rates were ushered in which has destroyed the bond markets outside the USA with artificial interest rates.By 2019.65 (August 27) theRepo Crisisbegan with the peak in the Russel 2000 which is the broad perspective of the stock market 34 years into this wave. Then the reaction rally came precisely in line with the Economic Confidence Model, which turned January 18, 2020 (2020.05). Now there remains a risk that even elections will cease to exist post-2024. Chaos begins in 2022 and Authoritarianism rises 2028.65.——————–

        When you look at it historically, the Republican party is fulfilling its mission. It was always a creation of rich Yankees dedicated to free enterprise. The Democrat party is the historical home of conservativism, the worker and the farmer. Joe Biden is typical of the party and it’s why the Republicans playing his greatest hits is backfiring spectacularly. The move to the Left has been met every step of the way by the Republicans. It shouldn’t be surprising that they would keep demanding recognition for their works. For example, the 1965 civil rights act had more Republican support than Democrat.Transforming the Republican party has been and will be trench warfare. The fight has dragged on for half a century. Ultimately, the fight is to carve out a home for the American nation from the party of Rockefeller. It will not be easy.

                Trump JR is simply a dumb political hack
even I was upset when he dumped his wife   What a low down piece of shit   Then he goes with Gavin Newsome’s ex    Just weird on top of it
but my guess is he has a following that overlaps with hannity’s core audience.
but Trump the father better dust off his political antennae and start listening.  If he wants to win.

                    Falcone – the one you’re referring to is the older son Donald Jr.; the one Chet mentions is Eric (with the blond wife and 2 cute blond kids).  Agree about the older son – used to think he was tolerable as a hunter/outdoorsman, but his family situation is deplorable, and I despise half-Puerto Rican Guilfoyle.

                        Jr. was the hell raiser of the bunch and Sr. at one time worried he was on the same path as Sr.’s deceased older brother.  Lot of time was spent crawling into Jr.’s life and making sure he didn’t have the optional time to get off track.  I’m not surprised by the occasional bit of rebellion.

Yes, the blond son isn’t half bad.  I also like Baron, who reminds me of my nephew.   And Prez Trump reminds me of my dad lol.  So there is a little familial warmth I have for that family.
But that sleaze ball son with the dark hair and 5′ oclock shadow?   Na. Don’t like him and bothers me that he dumped his wife for that glorified stripper.

            Truth. Interesting how whites drifted to the Republicans as they got wealthier. Immigrants and POCs are the new ‘little guy’. Goes to show economics is the deciding factor in politics.

Now the whites who got wiped out realize we’re in the demographic age, hence the insurgency in the party. Goodwhite liberals, fewer and fewer of them, simply haven’t gotten wiped out yet.

I’d have a good laugh if the blue bloods end up going Dem. That would have an antebellum flavor, wouldn’t it?

                That’s not true. The Democrats have always driven American politics. The Republicans simply got outflanked by Johnson. It’s a cliche phrase it so common, “I didn’t leave the Democrat party, etc, etc.”

                    Dems have big wins and big losses. I wouldn’t call them the conservative party, more so populist. They were only conservative relative to the Whigs/Republicans in defense of the southern way of life. FDR turned them into a socialist party, which took 35 years or so to complete, and that was only possible because socialism was marketed as populism.  What they have wrt driving American politics is continuity.  The right has been just as influential under different banners.I think the 60s was a confluence of a couple of factors. It was the high water mark of northern industry, and it was also when the ‘new south’ we know today really got started.  Hence LBJ, Barry Goldwater, the southern strategy, etc.Something about growth and right wing politics.  As the south grew in the 20th century it went right, like California before, like the midwest in the 19th century, like the federalist northeast.Just some half-formed ideas tapped out on my lunch break, please excuse the lack of detail. Rule of thumb: the right builds wealth, the left consumes it.

                As were the federalists and whigs. New parties are a right wing thing.

Demographics are a new wrinkle. At this point I’m thinking Republicans will split into 2 ‘white’ parties, one elitist the other populist, leaving Dems as POC party with token whites. This of course if whites don’t decide to stick together.

Sounds crazy to me, but everything is crazy now.

            The Republican party can’t be transformed.  That’s the lesson of 2016.  It needs to be “repealed and replaced.”
I can’t name a dozen people with any name recognition or influence who would be worth keeping around in a reformed GOP – out of a pool of hundreds of national and state pols.
Every GOP politician I have ever met has struck me as a greasy-fingered fixer or a vapid sock puppet – usually the latter.

                They were prepared to slaughter 600,000 Americans to prevent it.
If their actual rhetoric is any indication of the number of lives they were truly prepared to slaughter, 600,000 is off by orders of magnitude. To wit:
But, in 1843, after a speech, the sentiments of which had far surpassed the bounds of reason and moderation, in reply to a question by a member, whether he [Mr. Seward] was ready for abolition, “no matter though five millions of the South perish”—he exclaimed, in his seat, “Five hundred millions, let it come!”

            I may be mis-remembering, but at one point Williamson was make $250K from NRO and the NR Institute. He also had side gigs and then there is the payola. I remain convinced that his anti-Trump screeds were paid for by the Wilkes brothers. This is a common practice with Conservative Inc. That’s a good living even in NYC or Washington DC.

                Prior to his leaving for The Atlantic, the NRI 990 listed Williamson’s compensation at $210k.  They haven’t released the 2019 990 yet.  Rich Lowry was over $400k in the last one they have at Propublica.  French and Goldberg were also pulling down $200k a piece when they left.National Review appears to still have a committed group of geriatric small donors willing to fund them.  It is like the Mainline Protestant church with a dwindling membership of senior citizens that has moved left every time the culture has put pressure on them in the past 50 years and wonders why the younger people don’t want to attend.  Eventually they will go out with a whimper.

                        I’ve been an atheist all my life but the biggest value I saw in organized religion was what the Cultural Marxists detested the most – their social conservatism.  Sadly, that is gone now.  When I see churches with their hippy dippy anything goes stance it turns my stomach.  This is contrary to the “popular opinion” that somehow their values were a turn off to me.  On a personal note, a guy I work with who was married had an affair with a woman who was married and they had a kid.  This guy was dumped by the woman and still left his wife and married yet another woman.  Sometimes he even wears his little necklace with a cross with the cross showing.  I would like to put his Lutheran church to a test if they condone that sort of behavior and, if so, what the hell good they are.  I presume it isn’t any secret.  See, if churches banished those types I would be more inclined to support them.

                    Then that’s pretty damning
Because $210,000 may sound like a lot but in a major city like the DC area, you are basically in that zone where the upper reaches of the middle class merge with the lower reaches of the professional class.  One neighbor is a 2-income family of a nurse and an electrician, and the other is a maybe a female attorney and her dabbling hobbyist husband.  It’s not bad.
But the point is he would be willing to sell himself for that?  He could achieve that through honest hard work.

They are expected to generate other revenue, like book sales.  Some get “gifts” from wealthy donors usually for putting out articles on a particular topic.  For what he is doing, he is very well compensated.

                        They got some onetime funding from Google for something specific, but I don’t think that is an ongoing revenue source for them.  They do fundraising drives three times a year and get their readers to put up significant cash to keep them going at their current level.  There has to be a small group of bigger donors writing checks, but they can pull in $200k on a two week fundraising drive which is baffling to me, what do these people think they are getting for their small donations?

        Speaking of Glen Beck, I recently listened to him for the first time in years during a long road trip. He seems genuinely confused as to what is unfolding. He offered quips and pointed out contradictions, but the larger picture seemed beyond his grasp. The guy has all the deceptive personality traits associated with a recovering addict, but there was little doubt he was sincerely vexed. Your reference to a cargo cult is accurate and this is the stage where they find out the planes have stopped flying overhead even while they pray to them all the harder. Conservatism, Inc., keeps chanting and lighting the candles but the airplane doesn’t come. Those chanting with them are peeling off.So here is a total white pill.  As you noted, the accelerating trend is for GoodWhites to become BadWhites; the inverse simply does not happen. The propaganda outlets have decided they need to disappear the riot images because Whites are not responding as they were expected to do. Conservatism, Inc., is preaching to a smaller and smaller choir.We need to help these people transition (not in a way that defies biology), and accept them as tentative allies as they gobble down larger and larger red pills.Next stop: burning down the Republican Party.

                Yes, I have no idea what’s going on, who’s intentions are what. I don’t think too much about it – “they hate us and want us dead” explains things pretty well.
I do know that this recent round of rioting pissed off Boomers and conservative whites more than usual – more than I expected to see.
As others have pointed out as well, there appears to be a changing energy from whites. What this means, I don’t know. But it is something.

                Yes.  Where are the riots actually going down?  Minneapolis, Chicongo, Portland, Oakland, Austin – blue bastions just like Cville.  [Insert Adm. Akbar reference] They were praying to Moloch that Patriot Prayer or somesuch would show up to take their beatings and get arrested by the democrat Assault Guards (gee, anyone notice yet that cops in big cities are our enemies?!), they could point and shriek about nazis, and the normie YTs would swing Biden/left.The only way to win that game is to not play.

            Glenn Beck, like most other constitutional conservatives, is desperately waiting for his beloved non-whites to fall in love with the Constitution, the Founders, and capitalism.
He refuses to understand why this love will always be unrequited. It is psychologically impossible for most non-whites to love these things.

                I think that is the Christian idea of universalism that stands in their way of seeing reality
They are stuck on “We are all God’s children” and take that to mean that we are all spiritually the same and have the same desires.
Getting them to question that premise is never going to be easy.  Because that is their understanding of Christianity’s essence, and for it not to be sure means Christianity isn’t true

                As stated above :  he’s even worse than that.
I wouldn’t even call Beck a “constitutional conservative” – because when the litmus test on that one was run (Ron Paul candidacy) – Beck tried to bury the effort whenever it looked like Paul might be making progress.

            +1 for “burn it down.”
On Beck, he’s a good example of what 12-steppers refer to as a “dry drunk.”  He still has the mindset of a boozer, he’s just not (allegedly) still on the sauce.  His hokey televangelistic spirituality is another 12-step tell.  He’s 1/2 Elmer Gantry, 1/2 true believer in his own bullshit.  It’s pretty common to see grifters like him who get high on their own supply.

                The most hilarious aspect of Beck is his verbal hosannas to George Washington and his gun collection. Here’s a thought experiment: visualize Beck defending his family let alone shivering at Valley Forge. For that matter, visualize the same for almost the entirety of Conservatism, Inc.During the aforementioned multi-hour drive, Beck made considerably fewer references to Washington than he did years ago, and this is while the Founder’s monuments are being toppled and defaced. Maybe it was a one-off but who would be shocked if Beck evolved and decided maybe these dead White men were indeed evil?In addition to the Elmer Gantry-style grifting and delusional beliefs, Beck comes across as someone who very well may be batshit crazy. It isn’t a stretch to think he was self-medicating with Old Crow.

                    Don’t forget Beck’s Mormonism as part of his thinking re race.  They’re all prostrating themselves before the POCs because they didn’t welcome them with open arms in the past.

                        Yes. Mormons were enthusiastic slave owners and until their leader in the 1978 had a “revelation,” they were race realists and acknowledged black deficiencies.I think this Mormon Guilt Complex manifests more in Romney than Beck, but no doubt it plays a role.

I cannot count how many times I’ve seen TruCon reply guys telling critics “yeah, well she could kick ur ass.”  Does anything scream “cuck” louder?
FWIW, a few years back she and her husband were catching Hell for being tax cheats and general grifters from one of the other “personalities” adjacent to the Tea Boomers.

            Glen Beck is a twat.Way back when Ron Paul was running for President he played this game where as soon as Paul had good poll numbers – he would be all over his ass.  When Paul’s funding looked like it was drying up and/or his polls didn’t look so good – he would extol Paul’s virtues.It was plainly obvious he was playing a game.  Before that – I used to pay attention to Beck. Since then – and I’ve seen Beck play this game since then on other issues – I just tell everybody he’s a complete twat.Beck is no better than any of the other civ-nat type shills out there trying to steer you away from the truth.

Lenin understood that true revolution looks like this:
The “right” hasn’t even committed to the first scenario.  The “left” is all in on the second scenario.  Which is terrifying.

        It needs to be acknowledged the “85ers” is a brilliant coinage—I can‘t believe it’s never come up before now. Good for you, Zman.Commenter BPC notes its origin in the French term meaning “68ers,” to refer to the summer-of-love weirdos who cultivated their fantasy world well into their dotage. Houellebecq draws some wonderfully contemptible characters from that population. To me, 85ers has the same effect of vividly sketching a character type in the sparest of strokes. I would predict that novels would one day be written about the 85ers—if I thought there were going to be any novels at all in our future.

        This realization that our future as white Americans is going to be South African lite pretty soon and South African heavy in a generation is only beginning to sink in among normie conservatives. Right now as I talk to them they just don’t want to think about it or do everything they can to not think about it.Thus the appeal to the National Review although I think Victor D Hanson is getting more red pilled by the day over there.He sees it.

If being a Maoist provided the same lifestyle, most would happily quote from Mao. These are highly remunerated house slaves. The monied interests that underwrite these publications are not looking for candor.”
LOL
Some publishing company needs to put together an Anti-Conservative “Reader” or quotes book, taken from the Far Right.   There’s been too many great hit-pieces and passages like the one quoted above, to let them all go to waste.

        Who was the last Whig?  Taylor?  Fillmore?Point being, political parties fracture when a new set of pressures are applied upon them for which they are unprepared. Whigs had Northerners, Southerners, Westerners, etc but after 1850 they had no coherent, unified appeal that could cause voter turnout on a national level so they split asunder into a 1/2 dozen different factions, none of which could command a majority.Ending in Civil War, of course.That being said, still can’t shake the feeling that Conservative Inc and the Republican party is living on borrowed time in its present format.  People, especially white people, are waking up to the massive con job being snowed upon them by the PTB.  Still many more miles to go but it might have reached one of those Churchillian “end of the beginning” moments.

Change is in the air.   I was telling my mom as much last night.  As a person who grew up around hurricanes and beaches and storms, it gets me excited.  But I can see how “inlanders” like the guys at NRO are totally petrified.  They must be lie those tourists from small towns in Ohio who used to come down and soil themselves as that darkness over the horizon comes closer and closer.

        Boy, French manages to start virtue-signaling hard right out of the gate with that PoS column:
There are two things that I believe to be true. First, that America has a long history of brutal and shameful mistreatment of racial minorities — with black Americans its chief victims.\

                She will likely hate him and probably already does, just like mulattoshate their white parent.EVERYONE can see through his act, probably his daughter most of all. Nobody does this, except the white parents of mulattos and the weirdos adopting African children. She probably already recognizes she is being used. I actually feel very sorry for this kid.

                Many non-white kids raised by Whites grow up resentful. See Barack Obama’s autobiographyDreams of My Father. Throughout the text he insults his White mother, although indirectly, while showing practically no appreciation for the sacrifices his White grandparents made in raising him (black father nowhere to be found). Young Obama grew up alienated, not feeling black enough, so he’d come home to his White grandparents and go to his room to read books written by Malcolm X.I’ve seen the same phenomenon in many Asian kids, especially males, adopted by White parents. They end up with an imposter syndrome and come to hate their “parents” while longing to be back in their native culture with their own people, perhaps feeling their adopted caregivers cheated them of that privilege.One day, French’s adopted black daughter will show him similar disrespect when she writes a book or movie script claiming her “father” was a racist. In the future, there will still be an industry for sniffing out secret White racists. Every name in Conservatism Inc. is on that list, and their time will eventually come.

        Trump is a one-off anomaly, a one-in-a million event. And when he’s gone—almost certainly next January 20—the Repubs as a presidential party will be finished. They’ll almost certainly hang around for a few more cycles—until the money runs out—but they will never win another election. (It’s the demographics.) If elections continue to be held, something will arise to replace them. If not, all political disputes will be settled in camera by the Politburo. Whatever eventually emerges, the Repubs will not be part of it.

            Prior to Trump the Republican Party was finished. Whether this January or 2025, the GOP dies as soon as he is gone. My struggle is what would accelerate the situation more: a Trump loss or re-election? While the odds are Trump loses, the main concern is the Left consolidates power and returns to a slow boil if Biden wins. If Trump is re-elected, the viciousness will continue and repel normies.

            The United States will come to resemble China (but worse): a one party dictatorship held together by a venal professional class which moves in between the government and private industry, which will be essentially state enterprises run by and for the party (see corporate America’s coordinated banning of government critics from social media or their uniform, coordinated endorsement of BLM); the media will be controlled by the government, which will be synonymous with the democrat party (see MSNBC currently); but there will be token — non-threatening — resistance allowed to legitimize the system as “free” (China permits religion, but with restrictions and occasional denunciations, while America will permit the guys at theNational Reviewto hang around spinning their wheels); there will be constant surveillance of the population and loss of nearly all freedoms.Although, I expect the USSA to ultimately be less efficient, more corrupt, poorer, more fearful, less free, and more hostile than China is currently. The USSA may even strengthen already unusually difficult restrictions on renouncing citizenship or working abroad to prevent the valuable White upperclass from fleeing.

        The only value in noting the existence of cucks is that it reveals a stark symptom of our decline as a species. In a prior age, worthless humans tended to die off quickly because our environment demanded better of us in order to survive. Only in the present era of extreme affluence can the deadweight of social parasitism remain ever-present. And none of this is an accident. The elites want this disease to continue to fester. How sick is that?

One memorable quote: “The only reason I hate Arabs more than Jews is that I know a lot of Arabs, I don’t know any Jews.”

I also find it hard to believe that the goodwhites of today never heard this stuff in their own homes.  They act like they come from a background where people would NEVER speak like that.
Yeah, sure.

        The GOP is a busted brand, it is done after Trump leaves office.  Surprised Zman hasn’t done a post on the impending split in both major parties.  Political support is really in an unprecedented state of flux.
As an early Trump voter/supporter I couldn’t be more happy with his performance in office.  Hard to see how anyone who voted for him in 2016, doesn’t do the same in 2020.  Easily see people who voted Hillary in 2016 going for Trump in 2020.  Won’t have to wait too long to find out who is right, and who is wrong 🙂

        I know I read (and in the past repeated) that Williamson was a mulatto.  Lie or truth?  It doesn’t change a whole lot either way – he’s still a mouse of a man, but his gut-level resentment of the White working class would be a bit more predictable if he is mixed race.  If he’s merely another virtue-signaling white apologist, he’s not even worth the rope – just stop feeding him.

            Just about anyone above a middling I.Q. could see ten years ago that the GOP just needed to embrace being the White Party to win electoral success.  Even with he changing demographics a solid 70% white vote would be very difficult to overcome.Instead they are paying consultants half a million a year to figure out how to keep their base votes while throwing them under the bus for minorities that have never voted for them.

                One of the things that redpilled me to the treasonous conservative, inc. was just this: the repeated hammering on the “natural conservativism” of the Real Americans that was perpetually about to hatch – while completely ignoring the millions of actual conservative white Americans.All those anchor babies sprouting in the magic Reagan compost with their Big R card in hand are just waiting to vote for American Values. Any day now…Many of that C class actually demonstrate to their own white children their logic that the only way to return to 85% white 1985 America is to become 45% white 2025 Amerika.If they are willing to brutally show how insufficient and impure their own family is in this approach and that the only way to absolve is to adopt a poc or three so then their family can truly become American, there is no lower limit to the depravity they will employ to destroy us.

            What I’m seeing on the ground is that blacks, normal blacks, are being especially kind and engaging with normal whites like me, assuming I’m normal and I pretty much am. I don’t even know if it’s deliberate or conscious but seems like they want to huddle around usEdit    Let me add something.   I think there is something of “I’m not one of them” in these blacks  meaning I’m not a BLM extremist    Please, don’t associate me with them.  I’m your friendthere is more to it.

                    I was in Europe in September/October 2001. Similar vibe. The usual euro-superiority hostility was tempered, replaced with a greater effort to bond – and even genuine sympathy applied to routine interactions. I’m sure it had nothing to do with 90% of tourism evaporating in a day. Anyhow, interesting that the talented tenth recognize the risk of upending the white apple cart while the goodwhite children demand it all be crushed and made into vinegar.

                            Funny! Well I only met exceptional europeans so I don’t have an anecdote as to what the average European cared about. I do know many average Europeans over here, however, who are quite open about orange man bad, glories of globalism, citizens of the world unite, racist white male boogymen, and refugees welcome! All while making money and enjoying the spoils of this great land – and not, as it happens, protecting their own land from invasion and decay. If only indeed.

                    Reading Screwtape below, and noting your similar experiences, do you think this kindness has something to do with the fact that everything has become somewhat desolate?this kindness is taking place when there aren’t a lot of people out.  Then in Europe at that time, tourism plummeted, streets weren’t packed, and people started being kind again.I wonder if that is the primary factor? Maybe aversion to BLM or sympathy for Americans whose country was just bombed are tangential?  A people who for years have been packed in like sardines all of a sudden are free and kindness flowers.Whatever it is, I can’t say it isn’t interesting.  Like flowers blossoming in the nuclear ruins.

                Many of us have occasional pleasant interaction with blacks.  However, do you think that these blacks believe that the police oppress young black men?  Do you think think these blacks will vote for reparations?  Do you think that they believe that statues of slave owners have no place in public?  Do you think that they rejoiced when OJ was acquitted?
Even most white-presenting blacks feel a deeper loyalty to their feral racial kin than they do to white civilization.

                    LineInTheSand:  This X1000.  Why does it seem everyone is always looking for excuses for this black or that brown or the other whatever?  So a few are attempting to project their purported assimilation to White norms for the moment  . . . and?  How does this impact or change any of the eternal truths you just named?  I guess I’m just the eternal outlier – I trust them even less when they’re pretending to be amicable.

                        My Dad is a veteran, ex-cop, and a boomer-con. He’s started the “if Blacks want a race [fed post] [fed post]”. Nick Cannon and the Nation of Islam really set him off. This is a guy that talks with pride about how he fought the Klan and learned all the ADL and SPLC talking points. He’s a man of contradictions.I’m talking him off the race war stuff. When red pilling normies there is a constant danger of spiralling. They burn through that red pill quick and overdose into a weird, glow in the dark, place. Then they see they are surrounded by the cave trolls to our far, far, far right and snap back even further Left than before.We need to keep our eye on the ball. Progressive Whites are holding the chains. Their feral pets are a symptom. HBD red pilling should be a slow and deliberate revealing of truth not a lifestyle.

                    Dont get me wrong. We are different tribes. We cannot live together peacefully in anything other than small numbers and interactions. However, I do find it interesting that I wasn’t the only one experiencing this. I dont know if it is a latent fear, a “talented tenth” figuring things out, naturally nice black folks trying to be extra nice… it is unusual though.

                        From our conversations, I know that you experience multiracialism much more often than I do. I don’t want my theorizing to ignore your lived experience.
I just observe that once the non-white population of a place exceeds a certain threshold then the call of the blood starts to dominate.

                            Line, Thank you for the clarification, Sir.Long ramble below so don’t read if you don’t care to, I won’t mind…You are correct on critical mass of race analysis.It is my primary argument when dealing with my friends, kin and associates in the South.They have come to know me as the “Redneck from California” though I fancy myself the Smouldering Prophet from the Ruined Garden.”Yes, I even picture myself in soot-blackened pilgrim’s robe waving a scarred finger back in a westerly direction as i sermonize about the ruins behind me and predict the doom-a-comin! 🙂Seriously though, many Southern normies have a horrible naxalt streak and as the inundation is in the infantile stages, wax on about the good work ethics (cheap labor) and good ethics (a few dusky hued additions to Sunday church service).That’s where I begin to lay the table out for what is to come and begin to ask questions. Where are your young people finding drugs now? (from the migrant trailer parks that have sprung up) How many more foreigners are you seeing from year to year? (many more, as these “plucky” workers start bringing their brood north) A lot more deaths and drunk driving accidents? (Yeah, those boys dont seem to get it they cant get liquored up and drive). Are there getting to be a ton of their kids in your schools?(well, yes … now that you mention it). Etc.And then I lay down the preaching for what is coming. What California has become. How it begins. Prophet of Caution and Doom, that’s me. It’s a slow and delicate sermon (conversation).It works though. I am seeing recognition in their eyes. Plus, it has the added benefit for me of separating me from the herd of “all those Californians moving in and trying to change everything…”

                I noticed this from some too. A black guy started chatting me up in line. Some are being extra polite with cashiers, etc.
Most likely the smarter blacks are terrified about a white male backlash. In Toronto blacks are now mistreated, and discriminated against by Asians and Indians regularly. Whites are their last “allies”.
Either way, they have their own team and I have mine. No hard feelings and I hope that the sensible blacks can win out.

                    I think the terror of the smarter blacks is that they understand that they are simply a pawn in a larger Leftie game that will crush them.  They have been used as pawns all their lives, much more so than most of us have been, and they can easily see the score.  What is happening is that the likes of us are a lesser threat now, a lesser evil, in a matrix of threats and evils.   Civil society has been mostly civil to them, too.  They understand their own vulnerability in an uncivil society.  That black lady in NYC who keeps defacing BLM murals knows the score, that’s for sure.  She’s based.

                    Smart blacks, like smart hispanics, know the best possible outcome at this point is voluntary communities – a mix of nearly pure ethnic enclaves, nearly complete diverse ethnic enclaves, and anything in between – each left to their own devices. A necessary, but not sufficient step to that is balkanization, something the left will not allow.
A less desirable outcome, and I fear a much easier one to achieve, is a totalitarian leftist state.

                Smart people of all races and ages are figuring out that TPTB are out to get everyone. The threat from the other side is institutional and existential, and the threat from the likes of us…is…an unpleasant conversation. Some of the older black men are hedging their bets all around, and taking to heart the “treat others as you want to be treated”. Situational allies. Older black men have seen a lot, and I suspect their BS detectors are finely tuned. They are sort of like us, they can’t really depend on large segments of their own any more, and don’t really have anywhere else reliable to turn to, other than that small group of their peers who think as they do.There is an interesting line of societal demarcation going on. The double-downing of the Proggies, and then there is everyone else. Big chunks of the “everyone else”, who are being herded to the Proggie cattle cars along with the rest of us, are starting to get a bit nervous. Others are anticipating a nice summer camp experience at the other end of the tracks. They are being told that what they get at the other end depends on how they vote along the way—it has come to that. Many are buying what they are being told on this. How to handicap the next election, who knows? It is important to remember that what is at the other end of the line is basically the same, no matter how you vote, if you vote, and how the vote goes. The only difference is the level of commotion on the cattle cars along the way and a slight variation in the speed of the ride. Vote and act “properly”, as you are told, and the trip to the inevitable destination will be a bit more calm and less unpleasant.

                Interesting.  I am curious how hispanics will react to all this BLM crap.  No love lost between browns and blacks, and BLM is a bit of a finger in the eye to them.  And if a black VP is picked, that has to stick in the craw of at least a few (if hispanics are the largest minority, much larger than blacks, why all the catering to blacks?).  I don’t see many going for Trump, but I could see a few saying why tf bother?I wonder if “Hispanic Lives Matter” signs get torn down if placed next to BLM ones?  Hypothetically speaking, of course.  Or, heaven forbid, if someone being attacked for saying All Lives Matter on a BLM thread were asked “what, are you saying Hispanic lives don’t matter?”  How I would hate to see that kind of dissension within that noble cause.

                    C Matt, can’t speak to how hispanics are viewing the BLM thing en masse. Anecdotally, I work with a number of hispanic men, good men, and they are non plussed that their kids are coming home from college spouting anti-American rhetoric. They remember the Old Country(ies) and are ashamed and irritated by the rantings of their kids.

                    I hear ya
I never trusted them, more that I was surprised to find them being nice given the promotion was that BLM represented all blacks and all blacks were super duper pissed.  And maybe they see that we are just niggers now too and not this special breed  with some magical privileges.  We were promised our variation of 40 acres and a mule and got shafted as well.

                I spend a substantial amount of time around Black people also. I see the same phenomenon, but I attribute a different reason for it. I’m thinking the reason is more that normal Blacks see they have essentially won, but being normal, and not feeling there is an actual race war being fought, are satisfied that they are now being given the respect they are due. Also, they do not see White people as any kind of threat anymore, so they can afford to be somewhat magnanimous with us. No hard evidence, just my gut feeling based on 50 years of dealing with black people. We will see who is right sooner than we think probably.

                I’ve noticed this too. Multiple times over the past two months random black employees in supermarkets and departments stores have walked up to me and asked me if there is anything they can help me with or tell me to have a nice day or welcome me into the store. I’ve been taken aback by this, even stunned into silence, repeatedly because having lived in multicultural areas all my life it’s just a given that members of other races stick to their own, even within public spaces unless interaction is required (at the cash register)*. Rare exceptions are bold white guys who’ll converse with employees of different races without being prompted; most of them are from the South and are working-class types.Until now, I thought I was being paranoid. Honestly, I don’t know if they assume I’m on their side because I look like maybe I could be a leftist or if they are secretly embarrassed by BLM, which is clearly an op run by upper-middle class spoiled brats. Or maybe they are scared of white leftists and have been told by management to placate any white male who looks like he could go ape**** and burn down the store. I think the latter could be the case.*Seriously, the next time you’re in a public multicultural area, just look around and observe the “social distancing.” Asians stick with their own — same with most Whites and Hispanics and Blacks — even when they are in close quarters. It’s rare that a member of one race will turn to another beside them and strike up a friendly conversation or talk about anything going on in the world. People are literally standing next to each other but they might as well be miles apart. Most interracial interactions that do occur will involve forced interactions such as payment processing or polite statements asking people to get out of the way.

                    Yes, I have seen this countless times in London and other large cities – most alarmingly, in smaller French towns. Seems that the only problem most groups have with an Apartheid system is when it is being forced on them… Otherwise, they’re good to go.

                Well if that is happening – maybe that’s the opening to have a frank conversation with some of them.Because they need to be told that the whole BLM mess – is THEIRS to clean up.  Clustering around white people and being “nice” – isn’t going to fix a damn thing.I’ve said this before but it bears repeating:  White people are riven with all sorts of social and political divisions.  All  you have to do is open up a history book to see that white people don’t simply congregate with each other purely based on “whiteness”.But black people in this country most definitely DO.  The voting patterns show this very clearly.  I don’t honestly know if this pattern has always existed – but it sure as hell has existed for the decades that I’ve been watching politics. Black “culture” also reinforces the whole blackity-black thing on a constant basis.  You’ve Black Congress,  Black Music, Black movies, black history month – etc. Even though blacks are what – like 13% of the population?  You would think they were 50% based purely on the societal infiltration and media presence.Anybody who spends time on this site – knows that one of the main efforts is to get white people to identify with their interests in the same way that black people do.  I honestly don’t know if that’s even possible – but as a side effort there should be some work put into letting all those “nice” black people know – that if identity politics keeps running on it’s present course – and white people start white identifying – then there will be no setting the clock back.And what happens after that – is a house cleaning, most likely purely based on skin color, with all of the hard core leftists being thrown into the pit or dropped into the ocean for good measure.Point here is:  all those ‘nice’ blacks need to get their shit together and put out a LOT of effort to get all the bad elements in check – and to get them to stop using their skin color as their uniform.Because in war – if you wear the wrong uniform – you get shot.  That’s the way it works.

        Williamson’s latest piece from Saturday. Performing a public service for their Boomer readers essentially telling them everything they read on Facebook isn’t true. I hadn’t heard their was a rumor that George Floyd had appeared on Judge Judy based on on obviously way too young man participating on the show with the same name. Maybe that can be Williamson’s new angle, he can be the Conservatism, Inc. version of Snopes.https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/about-that-george-floyd-judge-judy-video/

        Z Man is on a roll lately.  I’ll never forget a business trip to Dallas around 2006.  Looking around I said, well I may as well be in LA, this place is done.  Time flies.  Blue TX will come as quite a shock to them.  They’ll blame orange man, just as Pete Wilson somehow is responsible for the end of The GOP in CA.  The sad thing about all of this is just how long the Republicans staggered and lingered as precious time was wasted.

            Old expression: Democrats want socialism yesterday, Republicans want it in two weeksI think he’s talking about demographic change (“I may as well be in LA”), i.e. he saw far fewer Whites than expected — I felt the same when I went there on business in 2010 — on the plane from Europe, literally half the passengers were (dot) Indians, apparently relatives of tech workers in the area (H1-B abuse by e.g. Texas Instruments and other companies) — of course there is also a noticeably large number of Hispanics; also ghetto Blacks.

        Lost in the turmoil of the present revolutionary moment is also the fact that a year ago mere notion that FED could throw like… I don’t know, 5 Trillion MMT USD for like…I don’t know, major infrastructure project to update some roads, bridges, power grid, water and sewer lines etc, would be considered insane by most of reasonable people.A year later, about that much, or possibly more MMT USD was thrown out with hardly any supervision to keep uneatmployed people happy by funding their new 65″ flat screen for their moldy basement, and keep Wall St and Pharma happy by funding the bigest, most crude, insolent and shameless money grab in the history of the mankind…

        This is the same old rant on the perfidity of Conservative, Inc., one reads in here for several years in line. I wish the host stopped ventilating his bile and rather started telling his readers what is it he actually wants. We already know he doesn”t like Kevin Williamson. What”s new here? This time, I was so tired of this repetitive anti-Buckleyite litany so quickly that I decided to spend time to chek out Williamson´s post.What´s its topic, kids? It is about election strategy. (Same as the second post, the one from Breitbart, is on election tactics.) One does not go full Jared Taylor in a text of this genre. The zman bemoans Williamson not mentioning immigration. Well, if anything he does exactly that! Take any gullible cuck who identifies as Republican or independent, and recite slowly and loudly for him/ner: Texas, California, comparison, election, red-to-blue transition, urban areas. Even the biggest dimwit will be able to connect dots and guess the missing “immigration” entry. And for those who can”t, at this day and age there are plenty AI-algorithms right in their cellphones that can, If this isn´t a dogwhistle, then what is?The second post, the one from Breitbart, simply suggests that telling voters maudlin stories is more effective than appealing to their logic and reason, which they, actually, may lack entirely. Everyone knows voting folks are dumbasses in their overwhelming majority, so this is a proposal how to handle them. It may be smart, it may be off the mark, but the zman pretends to be dissatisfied because the esthetics is different from that of John Derbyshire or Peter Brimelow, which is not the issue.OK, maybe the zman would like the dementia patient to be installed in the WH in November, the country to get 95% blue and collapse soon afterwards, since every other outcome would just prolong the agony. It´s surely an interesting experiment if you are not experiencing it up close. Apparently, there are people who prefer a different future and are willing to exert certain propaganda effort in that direction. Some of them might even get paid for that effort by the sponsors who finance their think-tanks and outlets. So what? America was not created by people who enjoyed counting pennies in their neighbors´ pockets (those stayed in Europe).I think if the zman wants to remain relevant, he may consider leaving the Buckley conservatism alone and start collecting and passing on to his readers what information he is able to find about the people who will be in charge of changing JB´s diapers. That would be smth of practical importance for many.
