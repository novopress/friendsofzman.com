        The Cowpokes are supposedly signing Sammie to the practice squad. They must have thought “Brokeback Mountain” was a documentary. I’m sure Texans are clamoring for the gay guy on their iconic team.

        The Michael Sam’s “news” story isn’t over yet. It ain’t over until the fat lady sings.  The NFL is the supreme bastion of male testosterone in America.  Outside groups intent on the wussification of America will not let up until the NFL is brought to its knees.  Hoping to stave off public pressure, a cowardly NFL will cooperate in its ultimate subjugation and then its final extinction.  The league will impose rule after rule to placate its critics.  The character of the game will change until it is no longer recognizable as a professional sport.  And then no one will care.  I give the NFL no more than 20 years of continued popularity and success at the box office.

        Even for a guy who was maximally insincere about his commitment to pro football, he played his hand very poorly. He reminded me of professional feminists, who represent their positions loudly but very poorly because they have no experience in getting a beatdown in honest debate. I guess the word is “entitled”.

            It is a reminder that these fads are luxury goods. Having the first [fill in name of benighted group] is great when the results don’t matter. Frankly, I would not be shocked if the NFL may have engineered this from the start. Sam was marginal guy before the parade. Having a team use a throw away pick on his gets all the credit without any of the cost. Having the hometown team take him and let him play in pre-season is all upside and little downside.
