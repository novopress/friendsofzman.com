        I have know idea what sort of procedure  Lloyd Austin underwent, and it’s probably none of my business. Still, I’m hoping that for his first public appearance since the procedure he doesn’t show up wearing a dress.

        I remember Z man wrote a column a couple years ago on Taki Mag along the lines of “Revenge of the Bitter Mutants.”  That is what comes to mind when I think about the people in all these DIE places.  Whether it be college or the workplace.  They are all genetic poison to mankind, but since we lived in a once-prosperous time, they had the unfortunate luck to spread like a plague. I can’t tell you how much I hate sharing this country with these people.

        Lost in this is the personal aspect. Obama was a big Gay backer (insert joke here) and was obviously the mover behind the Business Insider and MIT leaks about Ackmans’ wife.I fully expect SEC investigations into Ackman, followed by DOJ prosecutions. It is personal for Obama and he seems to be the guy really in charge in the White House. For some reason Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin kept his hospitalization, including five days in intensive care, secret from everyone, including the White House. Supposedly the chair of the JCS was told, after a day.Personal stuff like this is a feature, not a bug, of Diverse societies. There is only so many top slots, at Universities, at Hollywood, at Wall Street. Ackman does not really care about DEI. He cares that its clear that the Wall Street-Ivy League nexxus means he’s next to be turfed out. He’s suddenly added 2 + 2 and gotten 4. Hollywood since say 2015 or so has turfed out many of the top (((actors/writers/producers/directors))) in favor of Diverse, Alphabet +, or War Karen versions. For example Disney is gearing up another Star Wars “Rey” movie about a character no one likes with an actress that has zero presence. Instead of Steven Spielberg, or Michael Mann, or Christopher Nolan, or Martin Scorsese, or Quentin Tarantino, or Kenneth Branagh (he did the first Thor movie), or someone of that stature they chose a feminist agitator from Pakistan who has only WEF-funded documentaries to her name to direct.Ackman and Obama can both see the trajectory: Academia first, then Hollywood, then Wall Street. One objects to it, the other is pushing it. Smart way to bet: power vs. money. All Ackman has is money. Obama has power.

            I’m sure Obama has his say in all this, but I’m not convinced that he’s the main player behind this. He’s too lazy and incompetent. Probably someone like Jarrett or Rice.

                For the record, Susan Rice is ackshually (((Susan Rice))).She is descended from a South Carolina chattel-slave-trading j00, named “Suber”, who enjoyed dipping it in the chocolate shiksa p00nt@ng on his plantation.Susan Rice, born November 17, 1964Daughter of Emmett J. Rice, born December 21, 1919Emmet J. Rice, daughter of Sue Pearl Suber [dates unknown]Very similar to the ostensible genealogy ofAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who claims to be the descendant of a dipping-it-in-the-chocolate-shiksa-p00nt@ng chattel-slave-trading j00 of the West Indies.If you put a picture of Susan Rice next to a picture of AOC, then it’s like you’re looking at cousins, or even sisters.Their noses are disproportionately [by orders of magnitude] larger &amp; more pointedly crooked than you would expect from chattel slaves out of subsaharan Africa [who typically have very smushed-flat noses].

            The belief that Obama has this degree of influence is a residue of Civic Nationalism, which argued who was elected or in office mattered. Obama is no doubt bent out of shape because Gay’s ouster, to the degree it is an ouster, alarms him and other affirmative action puppets and puts their grift at risk. Obama may be the front-line lawn jockey for a behind-the-scenes hit on Ackman, but he is playing a role assigned to him.If Obama’s ol’ finance marses decide he’s a liability, we will hear a shit ton more about his sexuality and drug abuse. It also will indicate Ackman has the upper hand (I don’t expect this but it is possible). Let’s just enjoy the show.

                Who do they think believes that story? As if the SecDef could be in ICU in Walter Reed without the White House hearing about it. It’s so preposterous that I could believe the people saying he’s dead in Ukraine and this is the cover story.

                    I believe it 100%. As much as it boggles the mind, I believe it.
Austin felt no compunction to inform Biden, because Biden is not in charge. Put yourself in Austin’s shoes. Why would you bother to inform Biden?
Biden is a moron illegitimately installed because the story of Biden, a moderate Democrat, beating Trump could be sold to normiecons. He is the human embodiment of Max Headroom.

                        Yes.  No point in informing Biden because Tater Joe is just a figurehead.  He’s not in charge, heck even Silly Jilly has more clout in DC than Tater Joe.

                        Whether or not the SecDef office informed the WH directly or “properly,” I’m saying he can’t be there in ICU in Walter Reed, in Bethesda MD, for 4 days, without the WH hearing about it.

                I’m sure whoever is functioning as the ACTUAL Defense Secretary was on the job every day last week.Did the shadow SECDEF know Austin was in the hospital? Probably.Did he care? Not a bit.Even the Pentagon has its Claudine Gays.

        The status seeking mentioned in the article is a natural aspect of human social groupings.When professors retire, they become “professor emiritus.” They hang onto a shred of their professional dignity. When military men go out to pasture, they’re called Col. James Toughguy (ret.) They get to keep their title as long as they append a retired suffix to it.The lesson is that we don’t want to let go of our hard-earned social renown. Just because one is older, it doesn’t mean one is free of vanity. In fact, it’s possible to argue that age makes one MORE vain, as that is one of the few pleasures one has left. In a disintegrating world whose house is falling down all around oneself, the mental pleasures are the last to go.[To read more of my writings, click on my name with your mouse]

            AI or whatever it was called years ago was already in use for finding plagiarism in student papers.  My department used it extensively.  I forget the name of the service, there was more than one, however the service we used took a digital student submission—say a Word document—and compared it to a database of other papers on like topics as well as Wikipedia entries and the like.Out popped a report that rated the “originality” of the student paper/essay and outlined “suspicious” prose used by the student.  The essential value of the analysis (IIR) at the time was in their database along the lines of the student topic.  If writings on the topic were in abundance in their database, you could expect to be caught out.WRT the current series of academic mediocrities, I can’t say how well the software would detect them, however it’s been perhaps 20 years and those services spend a tremendous amount of resources gobbling up data.  I believe they grab Dissertations and journal articles these days (but I don’t know that for a fact).  If so, it is a simple matter to digitize all publications bearing their (the plagiarist’s) name and submit them to such a service.One wonders however if such a service will process such submissions as they are dependent upon the good graces of the very academics being scrutinized.  ;-(

                    Without the software Compsci discussed, detection would require a great deal of familiarity with the source material (and the software requires the ability to use it or to be familiar enough with it to have the program run). I’ll go out on a limb and suggest Gay could be presented a colorized, Woke version of Hamlet and think it was original work. Like Biden, her stupidity, mediocrity and ignorance are assets to those who wanted her to fill the role.

        “Claudine Gay was a modern lawn jockey.”I witnessed this woke shit firsthand over 20 years ago when I was a tenure-track professor at a community college and got thrown out on my ass after a year.I had my PhD in hand so I was overqualified for the job, but I took it because I came from a blue-collar background and simply needed a job with state benefits. Back then I actually had some good students — one even transferred to Cornell after she got her Associate’s degree.Stupidly, I thought that I had been hired form my qualifications and that my job was to a) teach students a discrete body of knowledge, and b) formulate my own opinions, even if heterodox.Wrong! The place was a patronage swamp staffed by a clique of underqualified left-wing females. The Vice President of Academic Affairs at a college with 30,000 students did not have a doctorate, but by God she was the “first woman” in the position. My department chair was a micromanaging politically-correct Karen with only a Master’s in Sociology. She was utterly unbearable and wrote me up for ridiculous stuff like whether my office light was on or not. (Perhaps I shouldn’t have sniggered when she mentioned something about Foucault, but she would have found something else). She literally wrote me up for not sitting under the vice president’s dais and clapping like a trained seal at the convocation.The trouble started after about a month when I was assigned to a search committee to replace a retiring professor of African-American History. The Dean gave us an application from a Negro candidate who held only a B.A. and had failed out of, or withdrawn from 12 undergraduate courses before transferring from a selective institution to one with open admissions.Stupidly, I thought they wanted my honest opinion. I basically laughed at the application and said the guy was totally unqualified and there were dozens of PhDs on the market we could get.I got thrown off the committee within 24 hours and it was all downhill from there. The place was like the Soviet Union — once they found out that you were not a member of The Party in good standing, they were going to invent reasons to get rid of you.Eventually they hired a guy from Nigeria who could barely speak English for the African-American History job because the couldn’t find and American black. His student reviews were terrible — he missed class, missed department meetings, and lectured incoherently. The students hated him.The college gave him tenure… and threw me out. I haven’t had a decent job since.

            Xman, after you wrote that you were “a tenure-track professor at a community college and got thrown out on my ass after a year,” I hoped that you would tell your story.  Thanks for telling your tale and I’m sorry that it turned out the way that it did.You went down a path that I strongly wished to travel for but was unable to begin.  I love teaching and I taught at the college level after I completed grad school.  I tried to land a teaching job but was unsuccessful and instead joined the private sector.  This was about the time that political correctness achieved a stranglehold on almost all higher education.In retrospect, I am glad that I failed to get that job because I would have ended up with a sad and angry story like you.  The industry that I joined was one of the last to be consumed by hatred of traditional whites, but it has now mostly fallen as well.  We’re in the same boat now, throwing up over the side, and dreaming of mutiny.

                College isn’t about teaching. It’s about administrators stroking each other off with bullshit while stuffing their wallets with cash from make-work “jobs.” Colleges will put any live body with a pulse in front of a classroom and pay them pennies while the diversity coordinators knock down six figures.
I spent the rest of my “career” as an adjunct making less than $2000 per course. I actually taught college credit classes in a prison to convicted murderers for $2000 a semester. (The murderers were actually the best students, the drug dealers were the worst).

                    One fails to consider “grantsmanship” in your analysis.  Having spend a career at a top 20 research institute, I agree that administration is a plague.  However, in the STEM fields there, one published or perished and no one advanced without a track record of securing grants.Indeed, our last department head—brought in specifically because of this ability—addressed the faculty and stated that every faculty member needed to be submitting one $300-400k grant application per year.  This was to allow for rejections and such, but the assumption was good faculty would get one of those every couple of years or so.He specifically excluded minor grants as being a waste of time and resources to submit and monitor.  He also subtly hinted that bad things would happen to those who did not submit such grant applications, such as tenured faculty having to teach more than one class *per semester* (full load being 4 classes per semester officially) or teaching undergraduate courses or untenured faculty not being tenured (although that was pretty much known).

                        Yes. Well, there is certainly a significant difference between a STEM-oriented research university and an undergraduate teaching college. I worked at several examples of the latter. Grants were a non-issue, and publishing was either not required (at junior and community colleges) or minimal at 4-year state teaching colleges.There were a lot of things I probably would have liked to publish, but my primary goal was just to get a steady JOB with benefits first. Plus, I enjoyed teaching.However if you don’t a steady tenure-track position and you’re always hustling adjuncts gig and commuting and fixing your own cars and doing non-academic stuff to make ends meet you don’t have time for publishing.And even if you do publish, they might not care anyway. Requirements for retention, tenure and promotion are often a flim-flam — if they don’t want you, they’ll reject all your publications as insufficient, and if they do want you they’ll basically waive the requirements like they did for Claudine Gay, who never published a book — but has the “right” skin color.Last year I edited a book for a former colleague… he published it this summer, it’s his second book. They DGAF — he’s a white man so he’s still an adjunct.

                I fully intended to be a prof, but what I saw while in grad school convinced me that no history department would be hospitable to me. Therefore, even though I did snag the Ph.D., I never even sought a professorship. Given academia’s horrendous decline since I got my doctorate (2005), I made the right decision.

            Watched The Grrls take over the community college eng. dept. I attended almost 50 years ago.  The leftist/feminist women made it clear they’d only be hiring other females thenceforth.  Equality, you see.  Balancing the pendulum!I spent most of the Eighties working for a state supreme court, and attached administrative agency.  Same phenomenon applied.  The female department heads would use endless tactics to alienate and force-out the males on staff.Often, they then hired THEIR GIRLFRIENDS as replacements.  No I am not kidding.  Who’s gonna tell them no . . . H.R.?It’s been a slaughter.  Everybody wants to pretend this massive exchange of males for females in America didn’t happen the past 50 years.  But it did.  And looking around, baby does it show.

            What an interesting story.  Not unlike what happened to me although I became a white guy going his own way fairly early and benefitted economically much more than if I had stayed.  It has been nice not having to deal with diversity bosses.  I had a string of women and POC managers who were dumb and sometimes evil.  The multibillion dollar company I worked for was 150 years old and at the top of its game when it drank the diversity poison.  Now it’s gone.  Bankrupt first by lack of talent and finally financially.  They screwed their pensioners who were mostly old white guys.

        Well after years of resentment not having been accepted into any of the elite universities I was supposedly qualified for, I have to say I’m intensely enjoying the schadenfreude of watching them self-destruct through infighting and bleed out every last droplet of legitimacy.  It’s also a bit of absolution now with it being quite out in the open that the admissions are completely political in nature and all their academic work is equivalent to middle schoolers copy pasting wikipedia entries for their homework.It was always obvious that the negroid and hispanic students were just there as diversity props, but seeing the same exposed plagiarism from the demographicstein that was keeping the rest of the admissions for themselvesberg away from the goyim, well that just warms my little shriveled black heart.

            My sister hates traditional whites (and loves abortion more than life itself) so it was funny to watch her go back to school for an MBA and complain about how almost all of her grades were based on group projects and how stupid and lazy some of the students were.In spite of herself, she revealed that the ones who frustrated her the most were black women.  When she complained to the dean about her grades being dependent on these students, nothing changed.Of course, she learned nothing from this and would be angry at me if I pointed out the real source of her frustration.

                As mentioned previously, “group” projects were designed to promote minority success.  The best students hated such projects and avoided them if at all possible.  In some cases, the instructor allowed a group of *one*.  😉One rather good instructor we had took great pains to design group projects where each one in the group was specifically responsible for a particular aspect of the project and therefore could be monitored for contribution.  However, this often was subverted as the *group* readily discovered that the project was in danger of not being completed successfully on time, so they finished their part and “helped” the laggard to finish his.

                Oh lordy, the group projects while doing my Master’s.  Worst were the classes where they combined the undergrad and grad students, and getting those little peckerfart late millennials (early zoomers?) to do any work was impossible.  Like they wouldn’t even pretend.
This is on top of dealing with all the damn Pajeets and Ching Chongs who on top of being lazy also couldn’t speak English.  Sometime it would be the professor too, ugh.

        I’d not heard or understood the use of “perceptor” but found it quite alarming, so looking it up brought this–A preceptor is an experienced practitioner who provides supervision during clinical practice and facilitates the application of theory to practice for students and staff learners

                        The 737 first flew in 1967 and almost 12,000 of them have been built. Overall they’re a very good, safe, reliable airplane.
The Max is the latest iteration, introduced in 2011. If I am correct most of the problems have been with the Max-9. The one that the door blew out of last week was literally a new airplane, it was delivered from the factory to the airline in October.

        ‘Unless Bill Ackman has a new religion for these people to embrace, they will burn the whole system to the ground before abandoning diversity, equity, and inclusion. This means the collapse of the university system is inevitable.’Obvious to me in the early Nineties, when I was still naive enough to take some night grad classes at San Francisco State.Feminist-homo heaven, from faculty to stoonts.  Everything was about Deconstruction and Oppression and Empowerment.  Couple old white profs still wandering around the department, like the last bull bison in Montana.  Despite elite reputation, the creative output of their masters students suuked, with two u’s.  Community-college level work.  I bailed soon.Best to burn the colleges down now, make a clean break, before more years of indoctrination pass and more zombies are artificed and set loose.Lime the unis over, piss on the embers, sing a joyful song.

                Thanks for asking LITS.Well it was fiction writing so I got to torment them pretty good.  It’s all about wounding their hearts, and I know how.I was the lone voice, standard.  Realized quickly they weren’t at my level and weren’t my kinda folks.  Vamoosed.But that was around 1990, when I first began cogitating whether to shitcan my (excellent) career and strike forth into ?.  Work enviro was moving rapidly and heavily towards Total Fem, anyway.  Like the nation.Few years later I fled CA and transitioned to my new ‘career’ which basically was informing boys and men, from a foundation of traditional masculinity and Scripture.  Eventually I saw Christ as the highest form of masculinity and the prophets as masculine models.  Shoot for the stars.I specialized in non-verbal autistics, men and boys.  Los extremos.

        We’ll know it’s over when ambitious students go abroad to get their degrees, and US companies prefer those credentials to the home grown variety.STEM universities in China, Japan, even some in Europe, for example.Anecdotal evidence that China has enough STEM colleges that the “prestige” of sending their “little princes” to US schools has disappeared.They’re sending their dumb kids to pay full tuition for the fake degrees for $$$ signaling to their neighbors, but it’s only a matter of time.  US Universities are NOT going to like losing full fare idiots from abroad coming to their “safety school” league ivory towers.

            Andrei Martyanov likes to compare Russian engineering school requirements to American.  Our entire education system has been taken over by propogandists who turn out mediocrity.
He also talked about how the U.S. Secretary of Energy is an idiot politician with polysci and law degrees (Jennifer Granholm).  Her Russian equivalent has advanced engineering degrees in electric transmission.

                In US national politicians generally have a law degree. In the business world typically an MBA. You know the country is doomed just because of this. In China and Russia typically they have engineering or hard science degrees. Putin is a bit of an anomaly in that he has a law degree (I think).

                At one point a few years back the Russians switched to the, “Bologna System,” of higher education when EU integration was still a possibility.
Within a couple years of that switch the Russians noticed a significant decline in the quality of their university grads.
Their (correct) solution was to totally dump the EU system and return to their prior Soviet system of higher education.

            From reading an article here and there over the years, many of the world’s universities are basically diploma mills. In certain cultures, having an ancestry one can brag about is very important, and thus an industry exists to concoct imaginary genealogy to taste. Apparently a university degree is little different. For enough money, !Mbembe-Ngogo or Abdullah can be awarded the degree of his or more likely, his father’s choice. This, to a large degree, is (perhaps make that “was”) the reason that so many furriners came to America for a “real” University program.

        The social promotion system is about maintaining the myth of egalitarianism.I doubt that this is really the case. Egalitarianism served as a catchword that inspired earlier generations of liberal revolutionaries, but back in those days it had a very different connotation. The idea that political equality before the law implies the literal equivalence of all people in every respect, is a bit of a stretch even for staunch Leftists. The actual question of whether and how abilities differ between racial groupings is of very limited interest to most people and it in no way accounts for the extreme degree of passionate feelings inflaming this debate.The social promotion system is about grabbing a greater share of the spoils. Like labor unions and lobbyists, organized minority groups agitate for a bigger slice of the pie, and they aren’t too fastidious about the rationale. While they may resort to the word “underrepresentation” when it works for them, they will just as readily cite poverty, slavery, lead in the paint chips, or anything else when it’s convenient for them.One of the criticisms of HBD that I’ve often lodged over the years is that it is absolutely politically irrelevantwhatpeople believe about racial differences, because the racial spoils system is compatible with any ideology. If every Leftist and Progressive in the country became a thoroughgoing race-realist tomorrow morning, they would not need to alter their political opinions one jot. They could easily shift from, “Blacks are held down by a legacy of slavery, therefore they need affirmative action to help them” to “Blacks are genetically less intelligent than whites, therefore they need affirmative action to help them” without missing a beat.The truth or falsehood of any of these statements is irrelevant to the outcome. Since it’s just a power grab to begin with, it uses whatever weapon is ready to hand, as any scrapper would.I think the only way to stop this sort of grift is to literally take away the punch bowl and let it be known that there will be no money, no sinecures, no benefit whatsoever accruing to minority agitation. The slow process of eliminating AA through the courts has already begun, but it will take a lot more time and effort before it filters through the culture. However, the signation of Claudine Gay was a watershed event that will stand out more clearly as time goes by.

            Intelligent Dasein:  I hesitate to respond to you, because I really don’t want to encourage your further commenting.  However, your main point (that it’s ultimately about power and even accepting the reality of racial differences wouldn’t change the battle plan) is quite true.  Your proposed solution, however, is from another time and place.  The money men (such as Ackman) have already threatened to take away their lucre in order to bring their foot soldiers to heel.  Even if that works in the short term, it will ultimately fail.  The darker hued have the bit between their teeth and . . . more importantly – the numbers.Waiting for the magic ‘courts’ to solve this is like the Jan 6 people relying on ‘rule of law’ and singing the national anthem in prison.  It is time to put away childish things and face reality.  Culture is downstream from genetics – which you resolutely deny – and that’s why idiocracy now holds sway, and will until it all crashes.

            Based on the body of Z-Man’s work he understands this. He said it is about maintaining the myth.It must maintain that myth as a first principle and first priority. Sharing that priority is the myth that inequality exists because of oppression – oppression carried out solely by white people and their civilization.Those are done as a pretext to expand and entrench The Regime’s patronage/spoils system that you correctly point out.Without those myths there is no justification for the spoils/patronage system.The War On Poverty was the Left’s old moral argument. That war failed. In fact, it created more poverty of all kinds besides material poverty. The next step is to say that it failed because of white people. So whites must be dispossessed and gotten rid of as a pre-condition.The Regime wants its patronage system so badly that it will commit any atrocity and tell any lie in order to create it.

            HBD is for white consumption, not black, because it demonstrates to whites that there is no end to the DIE regime, no day when the mission will be accomplished. Blacks will always be behind no matter what you do. If they were too dumb to realize that already, which unfortunately many apparently are.

                True. Theoretically, one might be able to eliminate “structures of oppression.” There is no eradicating instrinsic stupidity. The reality of genetic difference in intelligence is profoundly portentious, and that is why the Power Structure so monomaniacally pushes the egalitarian fantasy.

            “They could easily shift from, “Blacks are held down by a legacy of slavery, therefore they need affirmative action to help them” to “Blacks are genetically less intelligent than whites, therefore they need affirmative action to help them” without missing a beat.”These arguments are equivalent only if you think that the only purpose of any person’s role in society is that person’s greater glory and, more importantly, prosperity. In other words, if the former were true, society is missing out on valuable potential contributions from Blacks. If the latter is true, there *are no* such contributions (at least in cognitively intensive fields). The end results of elevating Blacks artificially (affirmative action) look the same but only from Blacks’ point of view.From the point of view of society it’s the difference between giving someone money in exchange for a product or service and giving them money because they stuck a gun in your face. This distinction might well not matter to leftists since they tend to be sociopathic but the former argument about slavery, whether valid or not, appeals to normal, emotionally healthy people as well. I would contend that much of the power of the modern Left accrued because it was able to make arguments that appealed to normal non-sociopaths. Take away the presumption of innate equality and replace it with HBD and the appeal of the Left to normies falters.

            I would argue that 60% of “Americans” actually believe all peoples are intrinsically equal (yes, they’re that stupid), and 95% of the Power Structure believe it. If I am correct, there is no point in agitating for racial spoils because everybody who’s anybody is already more than willing to transmogrify socioeconomic reality in order to put flesh–negroid flesh–on the egalitarian fantasy. Belief in racial equality is very real; it puts the E in the Leftist DIE blueprint.

            “organized minority groups agitate for a bigger slice of the pie”Your explanation of the cause of the state of higher education is inadequate.  As the current conflict on campi about Israel-Palestine has revealed, these minority groups can be shut down when the elites choose to do so.  Therefore, these minority groups have insufficient power by themselves and whatever that they may accomplish is only because it is permitted by the elites.The controlling elite includes almost no one from the dark races and dispossession of traditional whites is their highest goal.In closing, can you show me an example where a dark minority group won a lasting victory over the people who own most of the media and bankroll most of our politicians?  Such conflicts should reveal who holds decisive power.

                This, a thousand times this. It is why I chafe a bit at the term “Judeo-Puritan.” The latter is fully in charge, and always has been. While our racial kin, they also are our greatest enemy. Much of the Pali-Big J rumble both here and abroad is being orchestrated by the Puritans’s idiot children slumming at State and on campus. It also is a flex, which Ackman seems not to understand. Find a way to checkmate Big Puritan, and Jews, blacks, sexual deviants, or whatever groups or peoples used as weapons go away as a problem.I will admit up front I know of no way to checkmate the Puritans, who have been running amok since 1865. Maybe it will require an outside group getting their backs against a wall. The open border indicates a desperation on their part I frankly do not understand, but it is their project. Maybe like many end-regime elites of the past they have gone mad and suicidal.

            i’ve always wondered how you can make hbd more palatable to normies. One thing I say is “isn’t it possible that there’s no malice involved and it’s how the cookies crumbles. No one is saying that the lack of white punt returners in the nfl is a result of racism or the lack of male kindergarten teachers is a result of sexism. Things vary”.
It’s a way to smuggle in hbd without setting off people’s “racism terrain warning systems”.

                You make it more palatable by *leaving out race*!I never mention race, only that there are those who are less able to perform to “White” standards.  I leave out “White” and simply say, “your standards”.  Talk about incompetency, unearned promotions, and acclaim.  Competent folk have seen DIE in action and will come to their own conclusions. As to where the bulk of the problem lies wrt “race”.Of course, you need to guide them to that conclusion.  It’s not a one discussion thing.  But you plant the seed.  Also, It’s helpful that incompetence wrt HBD is *not* simply minority driven.  Whites are declining as well for any number of reasons.

        Decided to spin up the final season (6) of The Americans last night with my lady. Did it on Hulu. Big mistake. They have ads. I’ll keep it short. Only one white guy – a buffoon on for 2 seconds before being curbstomped out of a doorway. Nearly every actor is fat and ugly; they don’t just have diversity, they use their specific accent (eubonics; Carribbean; every variant of SoAmerIndian and mestizo spanish) In commercials you can max out on diversity. No refineries will blow up due to AfroChemistry. It is painful to watch though.Always on that show you could sense that if they could have it be all non-white they would have done it. It is just the setting makes it so they could not have it be believable. Still by this season, Beamon, the FBI protagonist is a metaphor for the white man, surrounded by an ever greater pool of diversity, (all blacks), who are magical and superior to him. They no longer even tried to keep the setting believable with blacks everywhere – including an extra in center focus in a honky-tonk bar where the Russian spy husband goes boot scootin’. Have to have equity in role count and camera time!The end of that series as a time waster for me was Ep. 2. As they cut in to the national archives an all white tourist group, (the only all white group of extras you ever see), is enraptured listening to a black scholar who appears next to a bust of a negroid in a 17th century aristocratic outfit (wig; long bow tie; ruffled collar; velvet frock …) The black genius scholar guy is telling them all about Lafayette and how wonderful he was.In other words, all white founders will be gone, but Lafayette, a non-slave holder from France, was a negro is a lie they were telling on TV in 2018. I looked and this was released in 2018. That means it was filmed at latest in 2017. Trayvon and Michael Brown had already kick started the revolution.As for Ackman and those folks, they aren’t willing to burn down the enemy and salt the earth with them, so nothing will be done. The religion that could have avoided the need to do that was American Civic Nationalism. They could have made that the civic religion and it could have worked. There is only one problem, Ackman and his folk just don’t believe in it, and the people they agitate for their purposes aren’t going to believe it in a state of constant agitation. It also would have required keeping the demographics of the country. The toothpaste is out of the tube.Now Ackman and his guys are in the shoes of the WASPs who confronted the revolution in the 60s. They are in control now. Now is the test of their will and courage. Of course, unlike the WASPs, they fomented the revolution, so there is that little problem of integrity. On top of addressing that little issue, they need to have the moral courage to do two things: Put down the threats and/or acts of violence in a way as to emerge clearly on top; Use that position to do what the American Colonization Society never had the full support to do.Ackman and his boys are going to tamp down on free speech. Their ability to do something about this is a non-starter because it is departs from massive dishonesty. They want their cake and to eat it to. As long as Noel Saul Ignative and Donald Moss and a litany of the others who have for decades called for white genocide remain hushed up in a corner rather than fully renounced, they will be doomed to run out of fingers to plug their multi-culti dike.Merchants can’t run a civilization. Civilized men need to run a civilization and contain the merchants. A part of the containment operations needed are the will and ability to use force to sit at the head of the bargaining table and say, “Look, we can keep going, but we are good people and we don’t want to do this to you. We do have this option available. You can leave these shores and make the life you want there. It’s up to you.”Looks like the opposite is happening. Grubbing and grubbing for money while the world burns is what we are getting. Call it Afrochemistry!

            RealityRules:  Just fwiw – my younger son’s Christian textbook – about 15 years ago – made no mention of Pierre L’Enfant at all (the earlier edition of the same book, which my older son used about 10 years before, did).  When I complained to the teacher (Christian teacher at private Christian school) she made a kinda sorta apology/excuse and said she mentioned him in class.  Per the book which all students accepted as ‘truth’ and ‘authority,’ DC was designed and laid out (in the fashion of a formal French landscape garden) by L’Enfant’s black assistant, Benjamin Banneker.Needless to say, we pulled our son from that school.  But it’s everywhere taught as truth, and yet another reason organizing society on the basis of a theoretically universalist religion – one of which I am an adherent, although not in those particulars – will not fix what ails us.

            Lately I’ve been thinking about how I used to get together regularly with some friends from my church back in the early 90s. We were all pretty much normiecons but there was a fairly high level of what you would now call “race realism”. One of our gang was an electrical engineer who worked directly for DoD down in NoVa. He would tell us stories about the affirmative action hires they had. There was this one pathetic black girl who was an intern from Howard University (regionally famous 90+% Black school). She was was one of these people who are so ignorant that everyone feels bad for making fun of them. There were a few others but she was the best example of why AA was such a terrible idea.Lately I often think about why things seem so different today. Why does 2024 *feel* so different from 1994? I think the answer is that the elite has clearly gone from making what everyone understood to be a limited set-aside and concession to actually trying to do “equality” for real. In my friend’s engineering department the understanding was pretty clear. About 10% of the jobs were for blacks. Everyone knew there were nowhere near enough qualified blacks to fill these spots. In practice this meant that everyone in the department knew they had to do about 11% more work than they really should.In a sense though, this system worked. It worked because everyone, from the blacks riding everyone else’s coattails to the actual productive people, knew what to expect. It also worked because it was clearly limited in scope and was largely about blacks who were only about 10% of the population. Don’t get me wrong, this system was morally indefensible and introduced huge amounts of waste and inefficiency. I’m simply saying that 90s level AA was a well understood and limited problem that could be worked around and tolerated.It may be that it “worked” too well in fact. People got used to making these concessions to the egalitarian fantasy and the adjustments were factored into everything at the start in the same way that you never see your real income because of income tax withholding. Eventually enough of the people who remembered that it was all a lie died, retired, or gave up. The younger people in the new century then assumed that the basic egalitarian assumptions had been true and demanded that the logic of AA be applied rigorously and everywhere.

                    Cargo cult is good analogy. Strange White men once were on the scene, bringing many benefits to others. Then, for some reason the White men no longer come. We must create the rituals so that the Whites will come again with their gifts. Unlike the island primitives with their replicas of control towers and aeroplanes made out of reeds and wood, seeking to welcome back the mysterious foreigners, our present DEI regime does not want the Whites to return. Talk about ineptitude: they can’t even do cargo cult correctly.

        I dunno how you define collapse of the university system. I dunno if anybody does. As long as they have their big endowments, and as long as the currency those endowments are denominated in has value, (which also keeps the student loan program going), then there is no collapse. There is just a transformation into something stupid, silly, meaningless, and useless, which we are witnessing. So long as the cheap Chinese junk keeps showing up on the shelves, the idiocracy can keep running right along. I think we’re more likely to see pogroms organized by screeching university indoctrinated harpies than we are to see “collapse.”

            I think what’s likely is that the university system will resemble tomorrow’s military: highly diverse, more female, and stocked with people who would’ve not been let in in prior ages. With few exceptions, the uni system is now a system of “monasteries” to paraphrase Z.
To look further ahead, wanting to go to university will be akin to a Medieval townie wanting to join the local abbey. People will be like, “Okay, sure, if you want to dedicate your life to superstition go ahead, just don’t be a judgmental dick about it.”

            The collapse of the university system will probably be part of a more general collapse. I’m reminded of Dmitry Orlov’s of some years ago, titled “The Five Stages of Collapse.” His thesis was that US collapse will be cascading. The five stages will be financial, commercial, political, cultural, and social (I hope I have the order right). Subsequently, in fact a few years later, he corrected himself, arguing that in the US it will occur on all five fronts simultaneously. Regardless of which version you go for, the collapse of the educational system will be part of a more general collapse. For example, if there is a financial collapse I daresay it will have a critical impact on the student loan racket. The collapse of a complex society is a messy affair.Even without a general collapse one has to wonder how much longer youngsters are going to take large and — in many cases — unpayable loans for meretricious degrees that don’t command the kind of increased earning power and job security that would justify the expense.

                In a society as materialist (and atomized) as ours, a financial/commercial collapse and a cultural/social collapse are the same thing. Political collapse too, since the regime’s primary instrument of power is the fedbucks it prints. It’s questionable if it has any other way left to wield power.

            Anna:  Funny that, since Jewish billionaires were DEI’s biggest boosters until it started to affect their own.  It doesn’t matter how many of the faux blaq middle class they lay off.  The slow-motion decay will continue – sometimes faster, sometimes not.  Perhaps the Jewish billionaires should have considered this prior to their war on Whites.  They suddenly realized they don’t all want to decamp to Israel when there are no more White’s engineering things for them to buy.  Cheap Chinesium is supposed to be only for the cattle, after all.

                Do you actually think the ‘Cheap Chinesium’ display you’re looking at as you type was designed or engineered by Whites? Do I need to talk about routers and laptops, let alone internet backbone infrastructure? Whether or not some Whiteys ‘invented it all’ at PARC or not back when Adam delved and Eve span is utterly irrelevant in Current Year. It’s Chinesium all the way down… and if the bits you possess are ‘crap’ then it’s because you didn’t buy the good stuff at a fair price. Cheap crap is cheap crap always.Do you think there is a White alive on this planet with the knowhow to design and fab 4K panels, let alone at scale? You are aware, I suppose, that there certainly are ZERO Whites who can run a TSMC.The irony is that even if y’all did rise up and overthrow the oppressors and build the fabled ethno state, it would have to be done with substantial amounts of ‘Cheap Chinesium Crap’… Or do you have division of miniature Albert Speers in your genetically superior American basement rhythmically defecating Baofengs and 3D printers and feed stock as they goose step to the Badenweiler March?Slinging casual racial contempt left and right might feel good, but it distracts from the very long and hard game of winning or just not losing further. The smart move is to accept that we as a race have royally fucked things up, plus allowance for a fair degree of Dolchstoss from Usual Suspects, plus Managerialism, plus It’s Just Not Fair… Wahhhh™ yada yada…. and then just @#$%ing get on with climbing out of our hole.News Flash: Those Chinky Untermenschen learned from their own past mistakes (colossal, murderous) and ours (a far greater self-own cum fall from grace if you’re honest about it and if you believe we’re supposed to be that unique and special) and got on with it.Back to this so-called Chinesium: It’s going to be a fact of life for the remainder of your lifespan and mine and probably much longer. So either pay up for better kit from them (really no excuses for buying crap if u can afford better grades given ability to intelligently read reviews) or sift through the dross… either way USE it to bury your domestic foes and don’t bitch about it.

                    How upset you are when someone dares  to accurately describe Han manufacturing, Zaphod.
I do recall you being less than complimentary about white  ethnic groups.
I doubt you have enough knowledge about white enginners across the globe to intelligently dismiss their abilities to operate technology they created.
Enjoy your celebration on Feb 10!

Unlike you I’ve been to China, lived in and around it, and done business there. So also unlike you, I know what I’m talking about.
I’m not a Han supremacist or total slavish fan. I just have a realistic clue. That is all.
Like I said above… shitting on the ‘Other’ doesn’t do anything to solve our problems. Quite the opposite sometimes.

            Yeah that didn’t even click until you said something: usually when I see a photo that ‘shopped it’s a man trying to pretend to be a woman.  There’s a slightly better picture of her elsewhere on the site and I’m almost of a mind that they touched it up to try and age her so it didn’t look so much like what they were doing: having a no-nothing kid teach a college class in order to score diversity tokens.

To further the incompetence theme in the post, you can look up Boeing’s position on DIE, as long as you aren’t sitting next to the windows on their new 737 Max planes when entire panels blowout mid-flight.  When you google this though, you will need to spell out “diversity”, because if you enter “Boeing DIE”, you get the literal results.

        A million years ago I was for a brief time a public school teacher in in a lilly white college town.  The few ethnic children were ridiculously fawned over.  Every teacher and administrator had this deep ceded fantasy that they would be that special influence that pulled the kid out of his oppression.  It starts early and it’s been going on for a long time.

            CFOmally:  White women love to fetishize blaq children.  Even when I was a idiot liberal teen, I never understood (and was never able to share) White mothers’ admiration for the first blaq children at our neighborhood pool.  They’d “ooh” and “ah” over these incredibly dark kids next to their blond and blue-eyed youngsters, and I couldn’t for the life of me figure out what they thought they were seeing (and praising).  It really is a form of mental illness, this idolization of the alien.

                These are they dynamics that I think are at play here:
-women like following/mouthing the rules of the rulers-the showy “ooh and aahing” is actually throwing shade; these women don’t want black kids of their own (usually)-testing to see how agrees disagrees-showing the prescribed moral virtue give them a weapon to advance over any “bad white” who isn’t as happy.  Diversity creates intra-racial conflict.

                Just so. Back in 1976 I was a little kid on a youth soccer team. The team was entirely white with the exception of a pickaninny named Bobby Williams. My God, you cannot imagine–or perhaps you can–how all those young white mothers were slobbering over Williams, telling him what a marvelous athlete he was and whatnot. The other kids on the team resented the hell out of it. And this was in West Texas, BTW, not Massachusetts or San Francrisco.

                    I wasn’t entirely immune to it at the time either.  I saw it resurface in my coaching days for my own kids.  One particular example was adopted by a wonderful, loving, although naive white family.  20 years later and multiple opportunities ignored and the kid is still a do nothing, whiney bun , who nearly destroyed the family that took him in.

            It’s just the standard Northern European Whypeepo need to be seen by every other Ditto as a ‘Good Person’. ‘Bad People’ got booted from the cave when food stocks ran low in February. An evolutionarily useful trait rapidly becomes pernicious as soon as aliens are added to the equation.
Also there’s something about the broad mass of White Women and Blacks — whether picaninnies or bucks. Like it or not, it’s most assuredly a Thing. And should make one think twice before listening to them on any other topics.

        Segway to the Boeing Max issues.  The Max may be the first DEI aircraft, as Boeing has been reaching for any non-white star they can find years.  They probably thought that they’ve now built so many redundancies into their planes that peppering their staff with unqualified people wouldn’t result in a lemon of a plane.  If you’re unqualified in some Blackness Studies program, it’s not life and death.  But now these people are being put into important positions.

                i find this dei stuff disheartening because I haven’t flown since 2012 since i’m afraid of heights. I felt that eventually I would start getting up the courage to learn to fly. By that I mean not actually flying the plane but learning to fly without hyperventilating.
The stories of the past year or so have really made me think that I waited too long to learn to fly without fear.

                    Phobias can be tough to overcome. Juice might not be worth the squeeze unless there are otherwise inaccessible parts of the world you really want to see.Back in the day, Lufthansa ran print ads showing a blond pilot checking the undercarriage with a torch in the night in the rain. Accompanying text was: “Lufthansa, the World’s Most German Airline.”Cathay Pacific then subsidiary DragonAir used to run TV commercials showing just the pilots in the cockpit while some VoiceOver blah about ‘service’. The real message was that the pilots were Caucasian and not Chinese. While I take exception to ignorant crapping on the Chinese with their boomers, high speed rail, space stations, and minor detail of their just about making everything we use.. I am not a total tub-thumping idiot and do not think that they make good civil aviation pilots for a whole bunch of sociocultural reasons.Probably a bit late for all that goodness now. Was just ‘yesterday’ but the past is a different country as someone said. You might do best with JAL, ANA, or Singapore Airlines — no DEI in those places, let me assure you. And the cabin crew won’t be land whales. Quite the opposite 😛

                    krustykurmudgeon:  I’m sorry you’re afraid of heights and that made flying so uncomfortable for you.  I never had that issue – took my first flight in 1963 and many times after.  Was spoiled for a bit flying business class when working for the government, although that didn’t help a bit on a 15 hour flight with my frustrated and uncomfortable and screaming toddler.The last time I flew was in 2007, and I found the TSA security theatre tiresome and worthless.  The plane was cramped and filled with diversity.  We didn’t have lots of spare cash to take distant vacations over the next 13-15 years, during which time I became a notsee rayciss and refused to subject myself to bureaucratic and non-White abuse – let alone pay for it.  Add in the  increasing competency concerns due to aggressive AA, and it just isn’t worth it to me any more.Maybe if I had the $ for a private plane and pilot and mechanic – if wishes were horses etc.I wouldn’t worry too much – I’m very sorry to say that I believe you won’t want to fly as things get worse – and that’s assuming they don’t place limitations on your mileage because of “climate change” or “White privilege.”

        The only way this will work is if companies that routinely hire Harvard, MIT and other ivy league graduates simply stop hiring them.
Just like “go woke go broke” wiped out beer sales, any conservative company that’s tire of this nonsense simply refuses to interview or hire these people.
From what I understand, boycotting still works in America. But maybe that’s only for blue collar and not elites who need to prop each other up in order to keep up the masquerade

            Small addition to your post:  add the word “black” after “hire” in your first sentence.  Unless they are legacies, white graduates from these programs must be incredibly talented.  OTOH, whites need to learn to shun these schools, so maybe your post is perfect already.

            I can confirm. I got my PhD in a STEM field. And even in the STEM disciplines, there is too much jargon and superfluous information.I loved the research, but I hated the write-up process. It was antithetical to my desire for efficiency. Often, I simply wanted to:1. briefly describe what I was doing2. show the data3. explain what the data meansBut no, I had to fluff everything up as per academic standards. Even my thesis was a slog to write as only 30% was truly useful information, the rest was just extra information that everyone in the field already knew, all of us have to repeat in everything we write.LOL – the plagiarism debacle happening right is a direct consequence of forcing everyone to write all this superfluous information. Ackman’s wife simply copied and pasted definitions from Wikipedia – right, that’s exactly what one should expect to eventually happen in such an inefficient system. How many times can one rewrite the same information without eventually saying it in the exact same way as someone else…although Ackman’s wife’s transgessions are pretty bad, lifting straight from Wikipedia.For someone to succeed in academia, you have to be great at coming up with new ways of saying the same stuff everyone already knows. Academia is thus an extremely wasteful environment.Nassim Taleb, a professor at NYU, is a great example of this, of this rephrasing and inherent wastefulness in language. His book titles and their translations into plain english:* Fooled by Randomness = Boy who cried wolf* The Black Swan = Reality* Antifragility= The Meek* Skin In The Game = CompassionAmazing how this dude established an entire (succesful!) career just by regurgitating old ideas. Four best-selling books, which simply boil down to Taleb saying he’s the boy who cried wolf (see his reaction to Covid-19), reality always win out over narrative, the Meek shall inherit the Earth and assholes like himself should work on their compassion.

                        Restated a slightly different way, it’s almost as if public funding of research at industrial scale created new problems. Now, beyond all doubt, government funding gave the world things good (space travel, electronics, etc.), bad (chemical, biological and nuclear weapons) and indifferent (your choice) that probably would never have been developed by 100% private endeavor. On the downside, all that money of necessity created entire ecosystems wholly dependent upon continued public funding. The scientific discovery that in the 18th century might have come as a result of a wealthy gentleman’s hobby interest today requires entire university departments, dozens of staff, perhaps a parallel hierarchy in allied corporations, all overseen and managed by a similarly structured government bureaucracy. This is the self-licking ice cream cone problem: yes, research needs to be done, but finding a job for the Senator’s nephew, or the daughter-in-law of the Director, or angling to get the contract to the guy you knew in the frat at Yale, or even to insure that one hires enough lower-level “diverse” staff to placate the HR gods’ current political dictates, eventually swamp out what were originally the core missions of the organization. The problem is eventually you have a Ministry of Agriculture that provides jobs to thousands of cronies but has totally forgotten how to grow wheat, corn or rice.

                STEM graduates don’t seem to be what the used to be.Here’s a Christmas story.  Son and I talking about folks that are basically not grounded in “first principles” of understanding in their disciplines.  In short, they don’t know what they don’t know and therefore fail in their efforts.  My area is statistics, so I cited an example of a video made by an individual proclaiming he could beat the house at roulette.  He demonstrated all sorts of betting schemes with  multiple placement of various bets on the table.  Claiming of course an overall win to be had in the long run.This of course is impossible since all possible roulette bets are in the house’s favor odds-wise.  On a fair table/wheel, all bets are independent and the odds of any combination of bets always is in the house’s favor.  The computation of the overall odds is fairly simple arithmetic.  Indeed, the roulette example is common in course instruction and a typical test question in beginning classes.Son came up with another example using a junior engineer he’s in charge of.  Son and engineer underling were talking and underling said he was working on an idea for an “invention” .  This would be a portable a/c unit about the size of a small fan that secretaries could place on their desks to cool themselves.  Hot air goes in and refrigerated air comes out.  Much preferable to a desktop fan which simply blows hot and humid air out.Son thought about it for about ten seconds and asked, “Where do you put the heat?”The new engineer looked puzzled, so son explained a law of thermal dynamics to him in very basic terms, i.e., you are pulling heat out of air in order to produce chilled air.  “What do you do with this heat?”  This very basic question had never occurred to the junior engineer.  Therefore, he had no clue how  to successfully begin to design such a device, nor for that matter, really design any device as described.Whether this engineer even knew that interior a/c units are already for sale (which run a long tube out the nearest window to dump heat), I can not say.  What can be said is that this engineer was not at the level of thought son expected of design staff.  And yeah, he was White.

                    As a personal anecdote, when I was a teen my dad bought a portable dehumidifier for our humid basement. I was a reasonably smart lad. I’d seen how a window a/c unit worked. I groked the concept of drying out the air by cooling it. At first it drove me nuts trying to understand how what seemed to me to be a modified air conditioner unit would condense water out of the air, yet the air was recirculated within an enclosed space. It was only with a bit more wisdom and learning that I understood that a room dehumidifier didn’t break the laws of physics. Its design purpose was to remove some of the latent moisture from the air; there was no requirement that it cool said air (which was what my prior experience with “normal” air conditioners understood), indeed, to cool the inside air was a physical impossibility, in fact ambient temperature would be expected to increase slightly since there was always lost heat from electro-mechanical apparatus.

        Another excellent article. I was a bit concerned that leaving the daily exposure to diversity provided by Lagos would cause you to lose some of your edge. Thankfully, you are still firing on all cylinders.Unfortunately for the world, the resources required to fund this drivel are not scarce. The endowment for Rice University is just under $8 Billion, which does not even place it in the top twenty university endowments in the US. An $8B endowment can fund a lot of DEI mischief, particularly when it is treated as a non-profit for tax purposes.The solution is simple: tax these endowments–aggressively. The funding for DEI initiatives comes from the excess profits generated by tax-sheltered endowments. Even the dumbest of dumb normiecons should be able to get behind taxing these endowments.

            Guest: Distance from diversity does not dull one’s edge if one has already been marinated in it, up close and personal.  It merely grants one blessed relief from affliction, but one is still easily able to see it and loathe it all the more once removed from its immediate reach.

            I’ve said for a while university endowments are like their own little money printers.
On top of that, they completely distort the surrounding local economies.
The most egregious example is probably Grinnell and its $1 billion plus endowment in an Iowa town of 9000 people.

                Very familiar with Grinnell–actually lived in Grinnell when I was a toddler. Known as a college for rich, dumb kids. To pick a nit, Grinnell’s endowment is between $2.5B and $3B, depending upon the source you consult. Most of it is courtesy of Robert Noyce, co-founder of Intel.

                    Daughter wanted to go to Grinnell.  At that time it was $40k+ plus other crap like board.  I asked a simple question, why?  What was it that she wanted to study and what were Grinnell’s rankings wrt that particular discipline.  She had no answer, well she did have *an* answer, “You sent (older brother) to a named/fancy school.  I want to go to one too”!  Yeah, sure, you must think I’m stupid…She went to my university on full ride.  She was put in a dorm and had to pay that with a job.  Otherwise her choice was to come home everyday to her parents. She was lucky to go there at that. With her level of maturity, I’d have never stroked a check out for university.It worked out however as she matured in those 4 years and at graduation presented wife and I with a reasonably thought out goal and career plan.  She wanted to attend graduate school at Stanford to study genetics and she fooled me by getting in.  Ouch.  ;-(She now makes more money than wife and I ever made together during our working years. An avaricious one she is.

            I don’t like the South Africa analogy due to the stark numerical differences, but, yes, the end result will be the same: a parallel white society that will not be dragooned into the vibrant madness after a point. The open border is both an act of war and an act of desperation because this fragmentation and dissolution is unavoidable now. It is hard to get Normie worked up over even Muh Military at this point.

            All the Afrikaners I know are flying planes for Cathay Pacific. Another ex colleague of mine ran for a while a kind of Schindler’s Ark operation getting his un-credentialed  White SA buddies starter jobs in the UK whilst somewhat defrauding his (admittedly amoral at best) employer to do so. Would that there were more like him! But I dread to think of the fate of their dumb fraction (used to be employed by South African Railways, etc. back in the day). I guess a remnant will survive in the Western Cape.With all this Afrikaner sentimentality, one should still recall that the Afrikaner elite, Ruperts, Afrikaner Broderbund SA Deep State Types, plus of course the local Usual Suspects sold out the rest of White South Africa for some Nobel Peace Prize baubles and banking facilities in Switzerland and Luxembourg + the chance to send their children to the Ivies and a life as Anywhere People.And there are still plenty of Afrikaner and Anglo normies who mouth platitudes while they’re boiled slowly like the proverbial frog. Even now.It’s complicated. Some will survive. But should not romanticise them. Besides they stabbed the Rhodesians in the back when push came to shove. Never forget that.

            Ostei:  Excellent exposition, which clearly demonstrates that those who maintain we’re already living through the collapse are correct.  I skim the triumphant conservatard headlines proclaiming the supposed looming ‘triumph’ of the anti-immigrationists, and I wonder what lies they tell themselves.  It was too late 20 years ago, given differing racial fertility rates.  And yet still, people think that somehow we can pull back from the brink.

            I haven’t checked for a while but last I heard Baraka was being ejected from the current_year canon because despite his eventual race-based social rejection of them, he remained aesthetically bound to his old friends in the “Second New York School,” who’ve come to be regarded as a sort of last stand of whiteness—textual density and allusiveness—in poetry. (That’s not how they thought of themselves, of course.) Basically, the vanguard of poet-academics don’t rate Baraka’s stuff anymore because even his dumbest “blackity black” material has traces of obsolete literary artfulness in it. Everything must go.

“Plagiarism” is such an ugly, patriarchal, White supremacist concept. The more enlightened among us refer to the practice by its rapper slang, “sampling”. All the cool kids are doing it. Claudine Gay’s boosted street verse, righteously speaking truth to power, is surely just a case of great minds thinking alike rather than venal cut ‘n paste.

        I would like to introduce a question in the context of today’s posting. Given the systemically-driven declines in both our society and culture, is it better to fail in slow-motion (as is now the case) or to speed things up and get to the bottom as soon as possible?Slow death buys time, and allows you to remain on the couch longer and open up some more beer and Doritos. This is the ethos of “muddle-through”  and “vote harder” mentality. Kick the can and pray for natural causes while coasting on entitlement fueled government gravy. Not exactly a noble way to finish out a life of easy living.Or is fast crash the way to go? Like a cold plunge into freezing water, it may shock the fat-ass off the couch and at least get him dancing and screaming in front of the TV. Ideally, he decides to throw a few punches before checking out. Perhaps even take out a few of the bastards. Would this be the modern equivalent of “men who plant trees in whose shade they will never reside.”

            Depends on your age. If you’re young and fit, better face the crisis now than later. If you’re elderly, better the slow decline so the crisis happens after death.
If you’re middle aged, you’re just fucked.

                I don’t think age has anything to do with it. If I can sever the carotid artery of some bastard with my bare teeth and last breath, that is a preferable way to go rather than stroke out on the couch watching TV.What ails us is a small cadre of pathogens inducing systemic disease. For about a billion years, Mother Nature has addressed this problem by sending forth antibodies to cure the illness. Antibodies don’t need highfalutin leaders to do their job, they just get the job done or the body dies. When the house is on fire, nobody sits on their ass contemplating the future remodeling plans.

                    To extend your biological example, the body dying quickly via a “cytokine storm” is still a win of sorts as a dead body does not spread the disease.  Hence the reason novel diseases tend to evolve/mutate into less fatal versions in order to survive.  Taking one of the bastards with you sounds like a win, particularly if you are old and the bastard is young.

                I’ve done some thinking as applied to one’s own personal life: is it better to die suddenly or gradually? Short of doing ourselves in, we seldom have much choice. Persuasive arguments may be made for either scenario. Advance notice of death gives a better opportunity to get one’s affairs in order. It occurs to me that, to varying degrees, the latter option is available when one is still in good health. These might be as simple and practical as having a will and trust in place. It’s telling that in most cases that option would only cost a few hundred dollars, yet about 2/3 of Americans lack it. Or it might be simply dedicating one’s remaining years to desired projects, to leave a legacy, even if it would be planting those trees that, maybe, one’s grandchildren would enjoy.I’ve done the easy steps (will) yet have some loose ends, like who would take care of the pets in time of need?

            The “fast-crash” advocates believe this would speed up the ultimate recovery of AINO to actual America. They seem unaware that the reason for the failure is the lack of human capital.  The entire society is brainwashed in DIE and equality.  Any fixing of this would have to be imposed. But who is going to do this imposing?  There simply is not a large number of alternate elites who could inherent the reins and right the ship.We turned the elite educational institutions into propaganda mils and created generations of people indoctrinated into the state religion.  We did the same exact thing to the non-elite institutions. We did it to cultural institutions.We live in a world where everyone can watch the George Floyd tapes from beginning to end and still insist he was murdered by racist White cops and a white supremacist system.I don’t know how things get turned around or if it is even possible to turn them around. But I know it is very unlikely to be fixed in a short period of time regardless if the system fails quickly or slowly.

                Successful revolutions are virtually defined as an exchange of elites. Everything else is just a peasant revolt. One thing the institutions have done very well is prevent the rise of such a counter elite.  Theoretically, it is possible to imagine a triumvirate consisting of, say, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Tucker Carlson, but ultimately they conspicuously lack the necessary hard power to succeed. Caesar had his legions, after all.

This is why the “slow crash” is the better approach. Nothing will fix this until there are larger numbers of independent-minded, high-energy white males. The only way to get more of those is to have outsized birthrates among based white families, and that is a process that will take 30-40 years minimum.
Hopefully civilization can hold out that long…

                    From his comment regarding circulation of elites, I suspect Tarl Cabot might be follower of Academic Agent’s channel.These guys are into the idea that it’s necessary to form a low profile selective cadre of people to carry the flame forward through the approaching chaos and dark times and hopefully eventually provide a vanguard when it’s time to make a move.Might be that there’s a bit of inside baseball as well… but the core idea is that it’s going to be a long multi-generational game. Even if there are elite defections and a circulation of elites ‘soon’… it’s unlikely to result in the type of polity most of us here would want — the demographics and current @#$%ed up state of White Normiedom just isn’t ready for it.Perhaps the day after the day after the day after Tomorrow…. doesn’t make for good lyrics though 😛

            Demographics is destiny. It’s the only thing that matters over the long term.Thus, you need to define what “crash” means, because we are now witnessing crises on multiple fronts.Would a fast replacement of Whites by diversity be better than a slow replacement? No, but it doesn’t matter, because the result will be the same.OTOH, would a fast total economic and political collapse be better than a slow one? Most likely yes, but we can only wish for that.That all being said, on a civilizational level, we are already experiencing a fast collapse. The only thing that could accelerate it even more would be a hot war.

                “Demographics is destiny” is literally true, but I think the jury is still out on this as it relates to societies.  At this point, demographics wouldn’t matter at all without immigration.  Every country with supposedly bad demographics is sitting at record population levels.  We don’t have any examples, at least that I am aware of, of a population that has turned the corner and is falling quickly to dangerously low levels.  We have low birthrates in societies with record numbers of people.People act like when something changes, it doesn’t have other effects.  A rapidly falling population would have other effects likely to incentivize family formation and having children.I saw a graph the other day with China having a negative birth rate (where deaths outnumbered births), but it still has over a billion people.  The most common reasons cited for lack of marriage and children were financial. Despite having more than 1 place to live for every man, woman and child in China, the cost of housing is more in China than it is in the West due to a massive housing bubble despite massively lower income levels. What happens when all these old people start dying and the cost of housing collapses?  The financial reasons for not having children goes away. This can cause cultural changes that promote marriage and having children.People go through a lot of trouble to not have children. When artificial barriers to family formation go away, which they likely will, it doesn’t take much to get people having children again.  Maybe I’m wrong and women and men have permanently changed in 3 generations. But I’m betting on nature reasserting herself. Besides, most people really like the process.

                    I was specifically talking about race/ethnicity. If the population is replaced by invaders, it’s game over.
Low birthrates are not s big deal if it weren’t for replacement migration. (I think we are in agreement)
Re: China (or any place with low birth rates) – I don’t think the low birthrates are caused by expensive housing or tough economy. Or at least, it’s not the primary reason. People used to be much poorer in the past and often lived in very challenging conditions and they still had children.

                        They didn’t really have a choice before. Today they have a choice. They chose not to marry and not to have children even when they do marry.  I have a very hard time buying that people have fundamentally changed in 4 generations. We have yet to see a population voluntarily extinguish itself. Will they chose not to have children when times are much easier in important ways? And can this choice be taken away if they still chose not to have children?  In a sane society like Japan or China, I say the answer is yes. Ban birth control. Ban abortion. Let nature takes its course. Condoms and the old timely withdrawal were methods available to these people with higher birthrates and tough economic conditions.We have the example of the good times producing record births in the post war period. The so-called “Baby Boomers”The population collapses of the past were never voluntary. They collapsed for Malthusian reasons of resource depletion in regards to farming.But I agree with you about replacement migration. This problem MUST be solved. At this point, I think it can be solved. But time is of the essence. They mostly walked to their “new home” and they can turn around and walk right back.  We have the examples of the Moores and our small hatted friends being forcibly removed from the societies they were living in.  It would be trivially easy to do this. What is needed is the political will. No welfare. Make it a crime to employ or house these people. When they invariably try the last-ditch effort of crime to support themselves, deportation.

                        People had limited choices in the past, but they did have faith and their faith was very pro-natalist. They also lived in a small world, with a lot of certainty about the nature of the world, and they were close to their extended families.
Today, they live in a demoralizing, faithless, skeptical, information-overloaded, overstimulating world of seemingly limitless possibilities. Cheap housing will not fix that.

                        In the case of Iberia, later Spain, I have some historical knowledge due to my useless MA of Spanish Lit. Yes the good Spaniards drove out the Moors and other non-Catholics but it was anything but “trivally* easy.” It took them centuries.It’s also worth mentioning that once Spain had been unified, they had a very effective anti-immigration policy. In those days if one was allowed to leave the country alive, that should have been considered a blessing. If one had been banished and returned illegally the penalty was often death.*I’d mispelled this word. Spell checker offered as suggestions: trivially and tribally.

                        Already that has been reversed. So far, the offered incentives for children are abysmal.  Forced abortions were common in the 1 child era. The 2 child era is a misnomer. It wasn’t a 2 child era so much as a ‘if you beg and pay us, you can have a 2nd child’ era.  It takes time to propagandize children in the joys of motherhood and for them to grow up and get married and have children.
One woman is capable of producing 8-10 children no problem. 4-5 is cake. Demographic decline can be reversed in 1 generation, at least physically.

        I was a student at one of this country’s more traditional institutions of learning in the 1980s and 1990s, located in a very large New England city, headed by a man who was passionate about the liberal arts, merit, and possessed of one of the sharpest tongues of any person I’ve met in my life since then.Much of this he saw coming, and would often hold forth to us in his office during rare moments of leisure about the crisis that would befall the US after he was gone. If we — meaning Gen X — did not correct the course that the US educational system was on, then, quite frankly, we would likely not have an old age. Nothing would work: hospitals, government offices, mail delivery, law enforcement, transportation — nothing.Abandoning merit is the death knell of a civilization. This particular person I’m speaking of also hired many, many ex-Soviets and East Europeans, who had defected to the West in the 1970s and 1980s as their societies collapsed around them. They saw what their experiment had led to. I listened to them as a youth with great attention, and now, in middle age, I see their visions playing out in cold, hard reality in front of me daily.How’s that for an education? I treasure it. But it should not be a treasure. It should not have been so rare. By disposing of merit — by pretending the Zulus had a Tolstoy — we have pulled the pin on a grenade.

There was NO chance of that happening.  GenX was so brasinwashed/marketed it to beyond belief.  The girls were uber Feminists shrills.
It’s just been a snowball for generations.  Greatest Gen/Boomers taught us point in life is killing Hitler and kissing MLK’s big black ass.  GenX was all in with addition of porn and action figure collections.

        In other words, to dismantle whiteness they must dispense with the rules of whiteness.This is key I think. Despite DEI and diversity worship, the people in charge are still “acting white”. Even the POC. The whole DEI thing, thus far, is trying to make POC “act white” and to shoehorn them into a lifeway and organizational model that was created by old dead Anglo-Saxons. I’ll bet that Brooke Johnson doesn’t speak Ebonics. Claudine Gay sounds like every AWFL. I’ll bet all those POC “chemists” and “engineers” at Forbes 500 companies aren’t hired just because they’re POC, but because they’re POC who are what used to be derisively termed as “Oreos”.I am frankly surprised that leftist activists have not pressured big organizations to hire black managers that sound like typical basketball players or baby mamas. Maybe too much diversity to handle? Or maybe they think accents are constructs.  The most likely answer is that DEI enjoyers (and cultural marxists in general) are classists not racialists. They think class is paramount, and DEI enjoyers have concluded that talking and acting like George and Betty Schneider of Olathe, KS is the archetype they most want to emulate. It’s an odd thing, too: kind of like the old soft British caste system. Your accent and comportment is what determines your success in life, above all.

            For leftism, diversity is a black person behaving as a white progressive, a Muslim person behaving as a white progressive, a Latino person behaving as a white progressive, an Asian person behaving as a white progressive and so on and so forth.You can be diverse in unimportant things for them: religion (because they think it is BS), clothes, food, etc. In all things that matter, you must be a white progressive and enforce uniformity of thought and behavior.Their rationale is that leftism is the default mode of the human race. Everybody would be leftist if it had not been brainwashed by culture. So, when Muslim women come to Europe, they think they are going to throw their headscarves away and start chanting “I am woman. hear me roooarrrr!”

                My dad, a based 20th century American WWII vet – was sure that the hijabis who started arriving in Brooklyn in considerable numbers during the last decade of his life “wouldn’t put up with it”- that they’d embrace our “way” once they got a taste of it.He assumed that their kind of (hard) Mohammedan Tribalism would play out just like the (soft) Urban-Ethnic Tribalism of the 19th/20th century Big Eastern City: i.e., “there,” but not at all insurmountable: patriotic assimilation first, St. Pat’s day a distant second.(They are not Greeks…)

            What you describe was once the case but no longer is. The deal was that negroes would be socially promoted so long as they at least aped civilized behavior. That is no longer true. Even that minimal baseline requirement is being jettisoned as an artefact of white supremacy. When you have somebody named Ketanji on the Supreme Court, the jig is well and truly up.

            The movement you are describing is well underway in large corporate and academic organizations, at least on the West Coast. It started in earnest with the movement to ban discrimination based on hairstyles, after which every manager damn well better have a few people in dreadlocks on his team, or face the wrath of HR. It has now moved on to dialect in the spoken word and written word. Don’t you dare point out that DaJamarius can’t write a coherent sentence, much less a paragraph or an entire memo.I have an acquaintance who manages a team of developers for a very top-tier consulting firm. His teams must meet DEI standards. Period. Part of his job is to do the work that the DEI hires can’t do, write the client presentation for them, then hand off the completed work product and the presentation to the DEI hires and stand in the background while they deliver the product and presentation to the client. It is completely demoralizing, but the pay is excellent and he is near retirement, so he sucks it up and pushes through.

        It is so delicious, and it is escalating now.Bill Ackman funded a lot of DEI via Pershing Square Capital Management prior to October 7. He claims ignorance of what that all entailed. Many young white males were harmed in the production of his religion, and money from Pershing paid for NGO’s to bring a lot of the border jumpers near you. Ackman now claims DEI a failure  and alternatively he dindu nuthin’. Abe Foxman, the former head of ADL, corrected the current head, the repellent Nosferatu doppelganger, when the latter suggested a fix to DEI that put Jews (officially) at the pinnacle of the Progressive Stack. Jonathan Greenblatt was informed that would be too obvious. Ackman has agreed in full.The president of MIT thought she had, and did have, full protection due to her Tribal blood line. She somehow was a poli sci undergrad who transitioned into molecular science at the graduate level. Maybe that happened. My guess is she was protected and undercut by diverse faculty and administrative staffers who unloaded on Ackman’s Israeli wife. That is a real case of emergent behavior. A hilarious angle is Ms. Israel plagiarized WIKIPEDIA. No one criticizes the use of Wikipedia as a primary source because the odds are they all have done it if they authored their papers at all.After the Right Rev. Al Sharpton jumped on Ackman over the unjust firing of the Academic Lawn Jockey, ol’ Bill reached out to the Rev, no doubt to flash a little coin in his direction. Sharpton’s minions in another act of emergent behavior showed up at Casa Ackman to protest. As far as I know, the ADL’s special security forces in the DOJ and FBI have stood down and the lawn jockeys are still on Ackman’s lawn. “Get off my lawn!” he probably yells.Take a long, hard look at this situation because it is the present as well as the future until the whole rotten edifice collapses. Those vibrants in front of Ackman’s house hold two contradictory thoughts: what they have they deserve, and the machinations and unfairness that got them what they have must be maintained. The Tribe that funded them is letting its lizard brain overtake its usual intellect.Stand back and laugh. There is no side to support, Root for injuries. If you can find a way, profit.

        The attack on DEI from Ackman and other powerful Jews is interesting, but it doesn’t need to be fatal to the university system. It’s mostly Ackman throwing a temper tantrum.Powerful Jews don’t really have a problem with DEI. They have a problem with DEI that doesn’t give Jews a special exemption. The elite still need a system for vetting future members of the elite and the college system remains the best way to do that.Indeed, as Ron Unz has shown, Jews almost certainly are over-represented at elite universities even after accounting for their high school performance, i.e. Jews not surprisingly are rigging the elite college system in favor of Jews. There’s no reason for Jews to blow up that system.I’d suspect that the plagiarism stuff will die (no pun intended) down soon enough and that the new crop of university presidents will go back to business as usual except that they’ll know that Israel and Jews are off limits – and don’t you forget about it.But as Z notes, the whole system is having a harder and harder time functioning as talent on the ground grows thinner. Sure, they can find enough blacks and browns who are smart enough to play their role correctly as university presidents, but what about all the DEI administrators and professors. Way too many of them won’t be bright enough to do their job right.The same is true at corporations and govt agencies.I’d suspect that you’ll see more and more of these breakdowns.

        You hit this one out of the park. Congratulations.
As another writer observed, if the university thinks it is immortal, it may want to have a talk with the monastery…

            I believe that Ed Dutton talked about how even Cambridge and Oxford lost their luster back in the day as they became just finishing schools for the elite’s spoiled children. They only regained their prestige when they started demanding better students.
Point is that Harvard being respected isn’t ordained by God.

            The entire Ivy League, and Harvard in particular, in terms of status is roughly where Cadillac was in the late 1980s/early 1990s: Churning out crappy, substandard, out of touch product while living on the fading glories of the brand’s past.
As proof, ever heard someone say that “X is the Cadillac of (certain product)” recently? Cadillac, like Harvard, was held up as a gold standard of excellence.
What’s Cadillac now? What’s Harvard now? Do you get what you pay for with either?

        It’s easy to see how this happens.&gt; Why do blacks lag so badly in academics?&gt; White supremacy&gt; Well, we’ve moved heaven and earth to fix that as a cause&gt; See? It’s just that sneaky and powerful! It’s literally everywhereI was talking with a guy (data scientist, as they call themselves these days) and the subject of black financial performance came up. I pointed out the obvious facts – in some fairly neutral context – and he simply observed that the data are biased against blacks and that’s another way in which sneaky White supremacy infests literally everything and requires constant diligence to fight.Data “scientist”: I don’t believe data analysis that tells me things I don’t like.That’s why the attacks on things like academic accountability and engineering excellence/competence and all the rest of it. All the things blacks can’t do are because the concepts, themselves, are unjust. The alternative is literally unthinkable.

            “All the things blacks can’t do are because the concepts, themselves, are unjust.”
The reason this line of thought has such staying power is because it’s true.  It is unjust that blacks on average have lower intellectual capabilities to operate within white concepts.  The mistake is thinking we can force people to be smarter than their biological limits, and that pretending they are somehow advances society.

        “For his part, Ackman has declared a jihad against MIT. He is asking for volunteers to scan the academic work of everyone at MIT.”The pettiness and the pride of these people is one thing that does – although it ought not to – surprise me. This action is the height of pettiness and just serves as a good reminder of the attributes that make up a wealthy and powerful individual is these times (perhaps all times). Then again, so what? On a trip to Boston, I had a handful of memories, none particularly great:1. Black guy shaving using a cars’ wing mirror in the financial district.2. MIT main campus, which we walked from our hotel to see, decorated in student missives promoting diversity and de-crying whiteness.3. Boston Tea Party re-enactment appeared to have a Chinese dressed up as one of the participants; don’t think there were any Chinks at that historical event.4. Tour of Harvard given seemed to indicate Leftism everywhere (no surprise).Fortunately, renting a car and driving to Battleship Cove to seeUSS Massachusettswas lovely. Shame I couldn’t train the big guns back on MIT.“The chemistry department at Rice University, for example, spends scarce resources on thirty different diversity and inclusion programs.”I had thought, foolishly, that STEM would actually be a redoubt – but one only need look at bureaucratic scientists over the last century to see that they are a highly cowardly set of individuals, on the whole, indeed. That said, it’ll be hard to find black influence in chemistry, a truly beautiful and fascinating field.Mind you, apparently Congo has loads of Uranium ore, so maybe that means “Dey is gud at da Kemistree…”

        After more than five decades of affirmative action bullshit, the room is really beginning to smell. It took a while for the rot to work its way into vital areas of technology, but here we are. How many times did we go to the hospital dreading to find out who was going to be on the other end of the scalpel? How many times did we board a plane and nervously glance into the pilot’s cabin to see who was there? And how many times have we slammed our phone down after some incompetent boob failed to even understand our computer problem? I will not end this rant with Z’s well-known phrase. You all know it by heart.

        The only question is that will we take a long somewhat linear path downward or will we at some point reach a tipping point and  have some sort of collapse? No one really knows or can know.I think the Z gave an analogy in an essay of our situation being like a drunk falling down some stairs, he falls down then tries to get up and is stable for a minute then falls down a few more steps again. Then gets up again and repeats himself.One thing i dont think has much chance of happening is a 1861 type standoff and civil war. We just dont have it in us anymore i think so whatever happens will be different than our last conflagration.

        “Claudine Gay was a modern lawn jockey. Instead of standing on their lawn with a lantern, she held up her diplomas.” This is perhaps Zman’s most brutally funny passage in recent memory.That said, Prof. Gay was standing on a Jewish lawn. She forgot this fact. Ackman was of course nowhere to be found when the Ivies and the big State U’s were pounding on rednecks and discriminating against Asians. But the Oct 7th thing changed everything.It is almost a cliche’ that our Jewish friends ask of any new development: “is it good for the Jews?” So I guess I would ask: “is this development good for Whites?” The sun is out and I’ve has a good cup of coffee, so I would say “yes”. Anything that gets elite Jewish folks thinking about the mistake they’ve made supporting DEI/AA is probably good for us. But I’m sure many here will kill my buzz haha………..It’s also worth observing that the “university” as a modern, apolitical institution had a very short history. The Catholic Church had to approve the professors in the old days. In Imperial Germany, the Kaiser’s ministers had this role (Bismarck was known to interfere in these matters). English Kings and Ministers interfered with Dons at Oxford and Cambridge. Later on, Commies were suppressed. There were always politics in academia. Of course, competency was at least expected.

                I think Jews and much of the white Left have as much poor impulse control as blacks. The Tribe probably had to emerge from behind the curtain, though, due to a rushed ethnic cleansing due to the ongoing implosion of the GAE and the realization that the tide has turned. It will hurt them.

                        A lot of our present troubles stem from a shipload of Jewish refugees being refused asylum in multiple places in 1939.

                Once you see it, you can’t unsee it.  I heard a show called “Justified” was good so I gave it a look.  I couldn’t get passed the the first episode, in which the villain was a violent gap toothed hillbilly with swastika tattoos complaining about Jews.  That is the choice Jewish Hollywood gives us.  You either love Jews, or you’re a violent gap toothed hillbilly with swastika tattoos complaining about Jews.

        Good riddance… my only wish is for these institutions to die out faster.. I recetly saw the Bear Grylls survivor island, men v women pop up on YT. A must watch for just the chuckles factor alone. TLDW, men achieve order from chaos in nature, having a sense of great accomplishment, enjoyment and comraderoy among their peers. Women cry, complain and bitch until someone comes to save them… facsinating, what would women do without excel, hr and shopping.. men must go back into the wild to feel free and happy.. women just wait at the finish line for the survivors.

            We have a number of shows like this (including this one) in the UK. And this is one thing that they are all good at highlighting: the innate differences between male and female.A group of blokes might build a hut out of timber of their own accord, for their own needs, and stand back to admire it; each appreciating the others work. Not only could the womennotdo this, if they managed to, the usual back-biting and sniping would take place:“Charlene’s crude joint just looks messy to me girls, and Sandy has thatched the roof poorly.”The simple fact is this:Women can ‘excel’ only when special frameworks (guides) are provided for them to do so. If these frameworks become devoted to female progression, so much the better for them.It is the reason why, at school, most of the top performers in exams were girls. Most of the most studious students were girls. The greatest rule followers are girls.Such a framework can be seen in Western education: go to school, go to Uni, get a job, climb well-defined career ladder.The greatest scientists and minds who ever lived often had no framework to follow. They followed their hearts (and also their lust for cash) to pioneer things. Read about the life of John Harrison, the problem he solved, and tell me if any woman would ever have bothered without some sort of guarantee of income or ‘career progression’ to do what he did. They could not have, because the very definition of pioneering, original work is that it really hasnoorder, or framework, or guidance system.

‘Read about the life of John Harrison’, never heard of him. Will do! always up for new role models to add to my collection ;p
I’m not into women-hating, it’s like getting mad at a dog licking its asshole, just part of nature. But I sure do hate weak men and parasites that have infested our beautiful world. Essentially making modern men and women into useless bootlicking whores for any regime that lulls them with pretty lies.

        For those who don’t know (and unless you’re really into the “inside baseball” of academia, there’s no way you could be expected to know), it is flat-out impossible that Gay’s advisers didn’t know she was plagiarizing. That’s one of the things dissertation committees are FOR. Not that they expect to catch students plagiarizing, but to make sure that everyone gets proper credit for everything. In academia, your advisees are a *major* part of your reputation. If Jones is a luminary in your field, you want to kiss his ring, and the easiest way to do that is to have all your students cite Jones all over the place.Also, if Jones is a luminary, people in the field will be familiar with him. If you use his work and don’t cite it, any competent committee will send your chapter draft back with a comment along the lines of “I see you’re drawing heavily from Jones here.” They will want you to not only cite Jones, but quote Jones directly (half the work in turning your dissertation into a book is stripping all those cumbersome blockquotes back out. One is tempted to bet that Mx. Gay never published a book for that reason — some junior copyeditor, not knowing she is one of the Sacred People, might point out that her language looks suspiciously familiar to Jones).It is simply impossible this didn’t happen (if they didn’t know, they are even more grossly incompetent than Gay). They knew. They just didn’t care.And that’s bad enough, but that’s also whatpeer reviewis for. You submit a paper drawing from Jones, to a journal in the field in which Jones is a luminary, the peer reviewer is gonna recognize Jones. Again, either the peer reviewer is beyond incompetent, or there basically was no peer review (and peer review is supposed to be anonymous).So take your pick, I guess — either they actively aided and abetted Gay’s plagiarism, or their “review” process was so slipshod and incompetent that they don’t recognize the work of luminaries in their own field. Or, as the Undocumented Americans might put it,por que no los dos?

            Peer review is going to be the next domino to fall. It’s clear it’s ideological gatekeeping at this point.The only way to get confidence back in this system to open-source all data used in these studies, as well as a nauseating amount of documentation as to procedure. It will lead to far fewer studies, but the publish or perish model of just sending out regime-approved, uninteresting twaddle to get their numbers up has to go.

            These DIE-Hires though have long track records of being “someone else’s problem” (SEP as Douglas Adams once put it).  She was wholly unqualified for anything she had done in her entire life, but whatever gatekeepers existed at each tier of her career passed her along because making her someone else’s problem waswayless risky than trying to tackle the problem themselves.  IOW, it’s asking a lot of the last set of academic gatekeepers for her PhD to be the one’s to defend the integrity of the entire system that created Mx. Gay, even if they wanted to, which they probably didn’t.

            “So take your pick, I guess — either they actively aided and abetted Gay’s plagiarism”I think its a bit of both.  They make exceptions at first, this person didn’t cross all the T’s and dot all the I’s but gosh darn it everybody really likes them.  Let them thru!  Eventually that happens so often that the quality begins to suffer, and eventually you end up where we are now.  But its a confluence of factors that lead to something like this.  But the one common thread of them all is what i referenced above.  Joe is much more suitable for this position, but everyone really likes Jim and gets along with him!

            No need to choose. It is both. One of the “primary sources” Gay failed to cite was WIKIPEDIA. I have yet to here a peep about that aspect, largely because I suspect all of the so-called academics under 40 use it as a source and see no problem with it.

                How times change, Jack!
When I was a lowly physics undergrad, we were told by our computational mechanics tutor:“Don’t cite Wikipedia as a source!!!!”.
I think Wikipedia is useful, but I still believe that any study worth taking seriously would at least reference the book from which Wikipedia pinched the info.

                    The worst part is it is apparently a given that Wikipedia is routinely cited now (not the linked primary sources, if they exist at all on a particular entry). The rap on Ackman’s wife is she didn’t cite Wikipedia, either, not that she cited it in the first place. In other words, she and Gay would have been fine if an attribution were made to Wikipedia.Those of us who predated the digital age at least were forced to plagiarize from actual primary sources, which required awareness they even existed.Idiocracy is attained when no one realizes it is an idiocracy. We are close, and this affair indicates we are there.

            “it is flat-out impossible that Gay’s advisers didn’t know she was plagiarizing”Gay plagiarized a fellow student from her own lab, not a luminary in her field. That fellow student and Gay were working on very similar problems, using the same methology (from what I understand).Not only that, but the parts she plagiarized had to do with explaining the methodology. That student she plagiarized is now a professor and is on record saying she didn’t plagiarize any of his ideas, but simply the way he wrote certain information. See the recent New Yorker article, which interviews the fellow student who got plagiarized. He explicitly states she didn’t steal his ideas, just his way of explaining the methodology.It’s the difference between plagiarizing “Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius” (common knowledge, and only so many ways you can write that sentence) and plagiarizing a novel understanding of how water molecules interact with each other during the phase transformation from liquid to gas. Common knowledge information vs novel idea.You’re not wrong about committees picking up if students are stealing ideas from the top researchers in the field (hard plagiarism). But you are wrong that this is what happened here. Here we’ve got a case of soft plagiarism (still plagiarism though) of people simply copy&amp;pasting “common knowledge” information.Even Ackman’s wife’s plagiarism is of the soft kind, copy&amp;pasting Wikipedia…though I do find plagiarizing Wikipedia definitions of common knowledge words to be truly ridiculous and hilarious.“So take your pick, I guess — either they actively aided and abetted Gay’s plagiarism, or their “review” process was so slipshod and incompetent that they don’t recognize the work of luminaries in their own field. Or, as the Undocumented Americans might put it, por que no los dos?”My pick is that you completely misjudged the situation.

Severian assumed Gay plagiarized big ideas from luminaries from her field, when in reality she was simply sloppy with citing descriptions from her fellow labmate.

            Peer review is another one of those supposed assurances of quality control that really isn’t worth very much. Numerous instances of faulty even fraudulent papers have been found even in (once-) reputable journals. I’m most familiar with the status quo in medical research journals. If the situation is that bad in what I’d hope are, if not STEM, at least hard science adjacent disciplines, how much worse must the problem be in the humanities?  Turns out there’s a world of difference between a handful of muckety-mucks browsing a paper and, if they’re diligent, commenting upon glaring faults. It’s quite another to go through it with a fine-toothed comb, for which virtually no one could possibly have the time or inclination to do.

        “Afrochemistry”…. Not really sure what to say. I keep telling myself nothing can surprise me anymore. But the surprises keep coming. [Felt like screaming “what the…!!” but no use]
We are better off starting from scratch than trying to untangle this enormous mess.

                    No, that’s not it. They are gloating at the thoroughness in their work that evokes such cravenness. Daring anybody to call bullshit, but – deliciously for them – nobody does, either through the narrative being ingrained beyond question no matter how egregious the offense, or out of fear having been instilled pour encourager les autres.

                    Moran ya Simba:  I don’t think they do, as insane as that sounds.   They think White man’s magic will survive the disappearance of the White man.  It’s an amazing balance between believing their own BS and simultaneously knowing deep down they’re fakes and incompetent.  It’s that standard black/brown massive self confidence on top of innate inferiority.  Don’t try to figure it out; logic is in no way involved.

            Exactly.  It’s impossible not to despise them.  Just the sight of one of them makes me angry.  At this point I want them to make it so that white people aren’t allowed in universities anymore.  Not as students, faculty or even the janitor.  The more things that lead us to separation from these monstrous creatures the happier I’ll be.

            It’s a fluff course deliberately designed to accomplish three things: (1)  provide a jump-start to the career of the instructor; (2) achieve a DIE target for the school; and (3) allow persons who lack the academic background and/or capability to complete an actual course in Chemistry to get credits in chemistry. The course description states explicitly that no prior knowledge of  chemistry is required. I can assure you there are many other courses like it in other departments–Afrophysics, Afroengineering, Afromicrobiology, Afromedicine, etc.I witnessed the beginnings of this process decades ago in law school at a top-twenty law school. Aggressive affirmative action recruiting led to a situation in which thirty percent of the class simply lacked the cranial capacity to tackle the standard class load, so the school created an entire host of grievance law classes to accommodate the morons admitted into the institution. It had the added benefit of enabling the school to hire a load of diverse faculty to teach said grievance law classes. Needless to say, it is no longer a top-twenty institution.We don’t need to burn it all down and start from scratch. Yes, the Ivy league institutions and other top-tier private schools are a lost cause, but there are dozens and dozens of top-tier public universities in America. We need to eliminate the Regent system, which is designed to remove accountability, and have university administrations report to a committee of the state legislature that funds the university. This simple change will make a dramatic impact overnight, at least in Red states.

        It’s worse than you think. For decades I have known about the replication crisis in all sciences, including medical science. Only about 30% of published studies can be replicated.   Probably our culture is at the end of low hanging fruit for study so if you have a carrier you need to cut corners.

            A replication problem in medicine and the life sciences is not new. In high complexity one small factor in thousands or millions can be off in the replication experiment. But in physics it suggests fraud.
It is deeply demoralizing to think that one’s vocation is becoming meaninglessness

            I’ll be frank.  My main thesis advisor sat me down and told me that one doesn’t “job” the data. I didn’t hear this message from anyone else.  Chinese and especially Indians were generally sloppy when they weren’t active messaging the data. The motivation is that you need publications and grants.  Inexplicable, or more messy data, doesn’t further those ends (though in the end often turns out to be the most interesting).  I’ve supervised chinese and indians.  I found many chinese were generally responsive to a message of integrity if they saw you were you were a straight shooter. Many NE asians  generally seem to admire anglo sensibilities.  I’ve caught indians actively changing data.  I pitched a rage fueled fit in one incidence that shocked many coworkers.   Say you have a hypothesis  that drug A will cause X response.  If you find it doesn’t do jack shit, you have a lot of wasted time and nothing one can build a manuscript or grant application upon.  Hence the motivation for shenanigans.

        In related vein I see there’s been another incident with a Boeing 737 and Boeing 737s all over the world are being grounded for rigorous inspection. The lower levels of engineering and maintenance competence are here and now.

            Which reminds me of one of my “favorite” dogs that didn’t bark: after TWA Flight 800 exploded off Long Island in 1996, not a single 747 was ever grounded. Not even after the NTSB declared that it was due to an internal fault.

            I saw that and, given what little I know of airframes, my first thought was “that shouldn’t happen”.  Notshouldn’tas in “of course bad things shouldn’t happen”, butshouldn’tas in “the way the thing is engineered it shouldn’t even be possible to happen even if it’s design wasn’t great”.  What I’m getting at is: that failure is really bad, an indicator that something even that simple was goofed up.

            This is just that odious rumpswab head of the Dept of Transportation flexing.  “Think of the children!”
Not to be a pedant, but it’s “only” the 737 MAX 9.   Boeing hates to “clean sheet” design new planes…very expensive and no guarantees.
I could ramble on for pages (airplane nerd), bottom line is this:
Boeing has enormous political clout and would rather force Congress and the FAA to give it “exemptions”, even for safety systems, rather than release a perfect product (or subject it to expensive recalls).
“Regulatory capture” fully in effect.
