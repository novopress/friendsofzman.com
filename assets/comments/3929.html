        I am amused, and forgive me for this, that the US has conflicting royal families. The Bush clan vs the Clintons is a bit like the Wars Of The Roses was over here, with the winners getting to slaughter tens of thousands of troops who thought, wrongly, they might end up on the winning side.Seriously, the war against ordinary people is never ending. The mistake was getting rid of the original concept of slavery, because employing ‘workers’  under more glamourous titles is the new slavery. Curious how all leaders and bosses still employ slaves.A Rose By Any Other Name. Seems relevant here.Perhaps some things never change, other than a name or title.By the way, would this war between the Bush and the Clinton be joined by a third claimant of black, female pretenders? The future looks interesting if chaotic.

            We can only hope the loser of this war ends up under a car park.
