        Meh – they always trot out that horse to beat over the heads of the poor. You should have graduated high school, you should have postponed having kids, you should have studied something serious in college, etc. The fact is that when you look at the private sector jobs that are created each month the majority of the new jobs are low wage (retail, health aide, hospitality). College grads are working at Starbucks and not all of them majored in something impractical. Tech and automation are hollowing out decent jobs – in the future it may make the most sense to forget debt slavery and devotion to some stupid private sector job and become a parasite freeloader working 20 hours at Chipotle.

            The poor are poor because they made bad choices. Welfare amplifies those choices, keeping them in poverty. The rich benefit by pulling up the ladder and avoiding competition with the middle.
