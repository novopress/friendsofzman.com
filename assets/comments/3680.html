        The longer I look at Tsipras (can’t quite help it these days, even though it’s a pain in the neck) the more I get the impression that he is a very narcissistic character. This perpetual glow, this basking in attention, this enjoyment of his own excitement and flamboyant rhetoric.
The Greeks have it coming, and it’s 90 + x per cent their own fault.

        One of the joys (?) of living in Europe is that there are so many shades of opinion squashed into very small space. As an Englishman, I tend to take a slightly jaundiced view of the frantic goings-on on the continental mainland but the cChannel ale isn’t as wide or as deep as I would like it to be. Oh well…. In the meantime while it is entertaining to watch all these political shades try to forge alliances and compromises, the over-riding pleasure is seeing the way socialism pops up in different hats and pretends all the previous failures and miserable alliances have never happened before.The media here has got giddy the way lefties do excitedly talking about a ‘revolution’ in Greece just because there are a lot of young(ish) people out on the streets of Athens waving flags and shouting from the top of cars because their man almost won a majority and can now pick and choose the running dogs with whom he and his lot can make friends.But, as always, it is the socialist (or Nationalsozialismus, if you prefer) cause that seems to be the reason the young keep getting on the streets for a party as if all this will work. I have no doubt the Greeks are tired of austerity and think waving flag will change things, but there is no money other than what they must repay and even if they got their wish and the massive bail-out of Euros is cancelled they still don’t have any money. But, thanks to the pleasures of democracy, they haven’t been told this.In the cafes of Athens they may well be planning over drinks how to spend all the money that had been unjustly denied them, but like so much of Europe there is only the Germans who are paying to keep them afloat.As I like to say, the Germans showed once they can march in and do what they want on mainland Europe, and Greece perhaps ought to recognise that while the present Deutschland divisions come with collar and ties, they will come.Still, you can’t blame an excitable people who like the idea of socialism to solve all their problems. there has to be some reason to keep the flags under the bed, because they don’t keep you dry when the rainy weather comes.
