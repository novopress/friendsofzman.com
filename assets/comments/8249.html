        Meanwhile, in OZ,  from the Brisbane Times:*****“Vilification on the grounds of religion is now illegal and in serious cases could result in a criminal conviction with a fine of up to $7500, under laws passed by the ACT parliament on Thursday.”Both Labor [Leftists] and Liberal [Conservetives] supported the move put by the Greens [loons, like all “Green” parties] Shane Rattenbury, who said the display of hatred, intolerance and offensive behaviour towards Muslims was one of the biggest intolerance issues in Australia today.”*****It’s my understanding that this is regional and won’t stand up to a challenge in their Supreme Court but it sure as hell is a sign of the times.Punishing badwhites for badthink.Thank God we have a 1st Amendment backed up by our 2nd.For now.

        I was at the Library of Congress a few weeks ago. As I looked at the many murals of women — many seem to have forgotten to pull up their dresses and all of them were ivory skinned — representing this virtue or that area of scholarship (gender studies was not to be found, alas), I wondered to myself how long it will be before we start painting over these or even chipping them away in some act of public defilement.

        The reason why the Cult loves Islam so much is because they admire its Maoist tactics. Ditto Castro’s Cuba and Stalin’s Russia. I think the DNC/BLM/Occupy/Code Pink/Huff Post, and so on, ad nauseum, would happily imprison or kill all of their political enemies and all wrong thinkers if they had the chance, and then live happily ever after under a caliphate run by Bill, Hilary and O-idiot.

        I would like to chain many of our politicians up with hyenas, but I’m afraid they would get along very well with each other since they have so much in common. Maybe they’d fight over the dinner bowl but the politician probably has an unfair advantage. The hyena only has teeth and claws, but the politican has no morals and lots of animal cunning.
Does this mean I am mentally ill, or can I too become “head of… the country’s leading provider of mental health services?” (No politicians or hyenas were harmed while making this advertisment.)

        After an Islamic suicide bomber caused a plane to crash, the only survivor’s remaining were three men who were previously traveling alone.  The three men consisted of an alt-right blogger, a muslim and a modern progressive.As all three were all walking in the desert, the alt-right blogger found a bottle.  Immediately, he picked it up, removed the cork and rubbed it vigorously.A giant genie appeared and hovered over the three men and said:   “I will grant each of you one wish and one wish only”.In his haste and excitement, the alt-right blogger spoke first.  He said:  “I wish for liberty, morality and justice to reign throughout all nations of the world!’  The Genie said:  “Your wish has been granted”.Next, the muslim speaks.  He said:  “I wish for a worldwide caliphate to administer sharia law instead”.  The Genie said:  “Your wish has been granted”.And finally, it is the modern progressive’s turn.At first he appeared undecided and, after much consternation and hand-wringing, he said (as the Muslim stared at him through angry eyes):  “I wish for three more wishes”:“First, please behead the alt-right conservative terrorist for his cold-hearted insensitivity”.“Next, since I am now a kafir, please allow me dhimmi status so I may live.”“And finally, may I please have burkas for my wife and daughters.”And the Genie said:  “All your wishes have been granted”.

        For now the odd story here and there is making the news.  But beware the silence when the news stories stop and people simply start disappearing.  It is probably already happening given the high numbers of unsolved disappearances and murders that occur daily.  Maybe the odd story today serves as a warning shot across the bow to the rest of us?

        The appropriation of maoist struggle sessions should be no surprise to OGH.  See them for what they are, and call them for what they are.  You’d think they’d spend more time ginning up some filter to hide the nakedness of it, but there you are.
Rubbing one’s face in it is educational to the subject of abuse as well as being entertaining for the nomenklatura.

        Historians of the future will be puzzled how an imported socially-distant group who loved to hate not only their hosts but their own cult (Shia versus Sunni, anyone?) could be so quick to get in the first “offended” claim and thus get the unequivocal support of an establishment that the freshly-offended wanted to destroy.
Hopefully they will exist, because I would imagine a dominant RoP won’t have any time for real historians.
