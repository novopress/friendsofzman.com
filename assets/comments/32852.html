        The steadily increasing Diversity must be a major factor in the feelings of dread and doom that many white people feel, whether they are willing to admit it or not. It certainly has directly affected my life in ways that are impossible to avoid.  And Camp of the Saints seems to be coming true.
My apology if you covered this later in your talk of this morning‚ÄìI haven‚Äôt yet finished it‚Äìbut this is something that jumped out at me.

            Yes.  Even whites who don‚Äôt want to admit it are emotionally affected by mass non-white immigration.  Huge parts of America will never be white again.  I wish it weren‚Äôt so. But at least whites who feel under siege are a different political animal than the ‚Äúnice‚Äù normies of the past.

                Some years ago, a left-wing sister of mine made sure that her family moved to a different neighborhood because it had ‚Äúbetter schools,‚Äù in the same exact way that people on our side have described left-wing behavior.  I had visited her former residence, and so I knew the real reason for her move.She and her husband belong to that credentialed academia industry that now is so powerful.  Many people like her insisted on living in trendy, hip neighborhoods near universities and colleges.  It‚Äôs interesting to see the demographic shifts in those kinds of neighborhoods (I used to live in such areas myself), and it‚Äôs very troubling to see how those whites who are now in search of ‚Äúbetter schools‚Äù bring their pathologies to other areas.  I recently heard that the once beautiful, historic community of Harper‚Äôs Ferry, West Virginia is suffering from this.

                    RamzPaul did a good video on white liberals taking their pathologies with them when they move.   One thing I‚Äôm trying to do is when people use euphemisms like ‚Äúbetter schools‚Äù, is to try to make them face up to what they really mean.  You can even pretend to be shocked by their racism!  Don‚Äôt you want your children to have a multi-racial upbringing? Hehheh

                                If anyone was still making genuinely edgy humorous TV shows there‚Äôs a hilarious sitcom that practically writes itself about a White shitlib family with Mr. Magoo levels of self-awareness who do just that. A good running gag would be that in every episode someone sprays them with gunfire (and totally misses in good ghetto style) and they wander around talking about how charming it is that their neighbors like ‚Äúfirecrackers‚Äù so much.

                            The PNW has the most ridiculous White shitlibs of any region. They will complain about their rent going up and unaffordable housing just like normal people. I often feel like torturing them by telling them that for a few months of what they pay here in rent they could buy a ‚Äútownhouse‚Äù in Baltimore outright. I really wonder how a human mind can tolerate those levels of hypocrisy and doublethink.

                                    Being a shitlib is a luxury belief. It is because, quite literally, White people created such a utopia, full of plenty and free of any real problems, that they can indulge in this thinking without facing any consequences for doing so. If you don‚Äôt live around black people (or maybe you live next to a black university professor or something), it‚Äôs easy to extol their virtues and how sad it is they suffer. You will also see these same shitlibs talk to southerners, who live in towns and cities that are 30-50% black, about how racist and evil they are.I suspect humanity has always faced this sort of thing in one form or another. VDH wrote a book about the tension between Greek farmers and the urbanites who did all the writing and thinking, for example.

                        Tell me about it.  As I‚Äôve noted before, I live a few doors down from the ex-Governor of Montana.  We often meet when walking the dogs.  Nice guy, but a total lib.I don‚Äôt have your backbone, 3g4me, so I‚Äôm polite‚Äîor reticent‚Äîas is my nature with neighbors/strangers.  Nonetheless, he broaches the subject of politics as seems was his former life‚Äôs main activity, and often quizzes me on the nature of political shenanigans at my old university.  At that point, I‚Äôm a bit more animated and disagreeable.  His wife, as is mine, is aghast at the ensuing exchange.  üòâI must thank him for one thing however, he really brought home in what a damn bubble I‚Äôve surrounded myself.  Yes, there really are people like him.  I left my exchange(s) him feeling like Roddy Piper in ‚ÄúThey Live‚Äù when he put on the glasses. Yes, there really ‚Äúlizard people‚Äù out there in skin suites!

                            It‚Äôs not just that people who want open borders are an existential enemy, it‚Äôs that people who want immigration at all are an existential enemy.The stupidly nice white people are going to cease being stupidly nice or they will cease being at all.I‚Äôve been reading about late Bronze Age collapse in Wilkinson‚Äôs ‚ÄúAncient Egypt‚Äù and Cline‚Äôs ‚ÄúCollapse.‚Äù Two take-home results are that (1) war is the permanent state of mankind and (2) not all nations within them survive the collapse. Pathways to ethnonational survival include being numerous and fecund (Egypt) or if not numerous being smart (metalworking) and utterly vicious.Not fecund, not smart, and not vicious -&gt; extinctionOne white pill is that for all our demographic problems there are still nearly 200 million of us on the North American continent, not counting irredeemable white leftists and counting real Canadians. It‚Äôs about preserving our people, not the borders of dead countries. Our biggest obstacle is lack of reliable organization/leadership. The recent hurricanes are, I think, teaching many normies that current country-level leadership/organization is not only worthless but detrimental.New nations are born from the corpses of empires and old nations reborn, long submerged under imperial dominion. One worry for the long term is that the same rats who destroyed America with behind-authority-exercise of financial power will attempt to similarly control all of the successor states that will arise. We need not just a new administrative class but a new ruling class.

                        This ridiculous urge of whites to surrender to non-whites in spasms of virtue signaling is so demoralizing.¬†This really is the new religious salvation for most whites.

I suppose these are the issues upon which we live or die:¬†Can we face reality and take our own side?

                    I lived in Harper‚Äôs Ferry back in the early 80s. The problems began when the feds came in to take over the area. We locals had always had access to the beauty of the area (confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac river beaches, ruins of old mills, decent hiking right on the Appalachian trail, etc). Then suddenly we couldn‚Äôt go down to the river banks anymore ‚Äì parking areas closed, etc.It‚Äôs on an Amtrak commuter train straight into DC.I can‚Äôt even imagine how bad it‚Äôs gotten at this point.Same thing happened at Lake Chelan in WA state when the feds took over.

                        Many years ago I loved going to Harper‚Äôs Ferry.  Guess I‚Äôll find other beauty spots.  It‚Äôll be a long while before I pay money again to visit a historic site or museum, unless I know that the proprietors aren‚Äôt Woke.  I was burned way too many times in recent decades.  Madison‚Äôs home was already turned into a disgrace when i was there in the 90s.  I‚Äôve heard that even Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon is getting ideogically ‚Äúupdated.‚Äù  It‚Äôs criminal.

                                On the one hand, I actually approve (as a non voter) of a lot of what Sarah Huckabee Sanders has done.  On the other, I was aghast when my neighbors informed me of her husband‚Äôs business interests in commercializing the Buffalo.  I hadn‚Äôt realized others had their private property seized when the  Buffalo Wilderness area was first created.  We live quite close by and would lose everything if the commercial plans come to fruition.

                                        Lots of conventional conservatives may share our traditional values but they also love to enrich themselves by transforming a nice small town into a place where they personally would no longer want to live.
5 years ago was the last time that I tried to fight this but, in spite of overwhelming public opposition, the local politicians gave the developers everything.
I think Z Man referred to this process as privatizing the social capital into personal profit.
I‚Äôd like to think that I could resist this temptation, but I imagine that the wealth is hard to turn down.

They had been brought over by the Spanish and the English and others over the previous 200 years.  It‚Äôs not like some white plantation owner ordered someone to go capture some slaves in Africa. That mythology is something that has been promoted lately but it‚Äôs false.

Now the folks who are not flooded out can spend money and effort to challenge their ‚Äúfair market‚Äù appraisals in court.
Yes, this is Pima County, AZ, USA‚Äînot Kazakistan.

        As a Gen-Xer, I‚Äôve spent my whole life watching things get worse. When I was ten, everyone around me had intact families, a stay-at-home mom, great health insurance, doting grandparents, safe (aka White) schools, and a government that, at least on the surface, didn‚Äôt hate White Americans. Not anymore.Now, we‚Äôre faced with an endless firehose of brown immigration as we‚Äôre lectured about our ‚Äúprivilege.‚Äù Meanwhile, we‚Äôre towing an increasingly heavy load to keep this country running. Our government hates us and doesn‚Äôt bother hiding it. We‚Äôre constantly vilified in the media, and our kids are encouraged to hate not only their parents, but themselves.Newcomers are given free food, free housing, and a free pass to terrorize Heritage Americans. Meanwhile, more of these ungrateful foreigners show up every day. No one with any real power seems to care. In fact, they relish it. If you complain, you‚Äôre the bad person. At the same time, violent thugs like George Floyd are celebrated, and that dude in a sundress is lauded as stunning and brave for exposing his privates to your daughter.It‚Äôs obvious what the elites want. They want to make us a minority in the countries thatourancestors built, because someday Whites will finally have enough. And when that day happens, they‚Äôre hoping that there won‚Äôt be enough of us to make a difference.No matter how you slice it, this can‚Äôt end well.

            ‚Äù‚Ä¶when that day happens, they‚Äôre hoping that there won‚Äôt be enough of us to make a difference.‚ÄùBingo!  That‚Äôs the end game.  Every mass subversive movement needs an enemy.  Often the enemy is the chief/current power in charge, in racial terms, that would be Whites.‚ÄúIn George Orwell‚Äôs novel 1984, the chief enemy of the Party is a shadowy figure named Emmanuel Goldstein. He is portrayed as a former Party leader who turned against the Party and is now the focus of intense propaganda. Goldstein is blamed for all dissent and rebellion, and his image is used during the ‚ÄúTwo Minutes Hate‚Äù sessions to rally Party members against perceived enemies. ‚ÄúSubstitute the group name, ‚ÄúWhites‚Äù for the individual named, ‚ÄúGoldstein‚Äù and you have pretty good analogy in modern racial terms.  Orwell was an ex-commie himself.  He ought to know.

            Problem is that white women either chemically sterilize themselves with birth control, or kill their own offspring. If you look at the birthrate of whites, it‚Äôs clear that all our enemies need to do is wait until our own women reduce our numbers to the point where we‚Äôre irrelevant.

        Even if America holds on, the things that made the country fun are gone.  I mean like road trips, exploring different states, etc.  Because everywhere you go, there are brown people.  The days of driving into some town in the middle of nowhere and falling in love and meeting a future wife, stuff like that, they‚Äôre gone.  The fusion of romance and mystique with nation are gone, IOW.  America was a very romantic and mysterious place at one point.  It is all very corporate and transactional now, on top off being miserably brown.And I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúbrown‚Äù as a racial distinction so much.  I mean that sort of gloomy disposition and lack of creative spark that is a predominant feature of Mexicans and Indians etc.  Brown means ‚ÄúBlah‚ÄùI think Europe still has a very good fighting chance.

            Good points.  I used to love to go on short and long road trips, including ‚ÄúSunday drives,‚Äù as my parents‚Äô generation called them.  Another one of my favorite things to do was to go to historic sites.  Now, so many of them have been taken over by people who read Howard-Zinn as gospel.  And so many of the rural areas and small towns which I enjoyed seeing are noticeably declining, if they haven‚Äôt yet been turned outright into places like Springfield, Ohio and Charleroi, PA.

            Design and fashion aesthetics mirror demographics. For instance, automobiles, clothing and houses are now almost monolithically earth-toned. It is exceedingly rare to see a splash of color and formal dynamism. This is one reason I drive a red car and wear Hawaiian shirts. I just cannot abide the dismal conformity.

                Interesting perspective.  I, of late, have gone in the other direction.  Black car, no highly noticeable personal adornments, just nothing to make me stand out.  Part of it, obviously, is a desire for current privacy (or as much the illusion of such as is possible for the present).  But part also is my distaste for the feminine constant demand for attention and personalizing everything (bling for the phone, vanity license plate, etc.).  It‚Äôs like little girls who used hearts instead of circles to dot their ‚Äòi‚Äôs in handwriting ‚Äì a stupid conceit to proclaim they are ‚Äòspecial.‚Äô  No, no and no.

                    Fair enough, but you‚Äôre conforming with the people you despise. I want to separate myself from them as much as humanly possible.

Here, in little Mexico, the houses and commercial buildings are often painted in bright, primary colors on the Hispanic side of town.  It‚Äôs the culture‚Äînot mine theirs.  Separation works wonders in that I need not see such of my neighbors, have little care what they do 10 miles away.

                        In most of my area, White people with no tats, weird piercings, or other garish and ugly affectations now stand out. The Indians don‚Äôt seem to get them. It‚Äôs sad that the only younger women, in particular, who don‚Äôt looks like sluts or hookers are foreigners. If you see a woman pushing a stroller or with a toddler, it‚Äôs almost never a White one. I try to tell myself that I‚Äôm stuck in a very shitlibby place and that even in other parts of the NW there are actually some remaining normal Whites with kids.

                All the 2016-7 hoax stories of Trumpist motorists menacing minorities had the MAGA guys in red pickups. Bad writing. Anyone who knew those guys knew their trucks were black or white (newer), silver or blue (older), the old Bronco colors‚Äîeven spraypaint camo more often than red. Red was for the rare urbanite who moves things across town, like florists and musicians. Not even high-volume-shopping rural wives chose red. Nobody seemed conscious of it, but the color specifically signifiednotbeing a rustic danger. ‚ÄúBottom‚Äù truck.Recent pictures of Trump events show that his biggest fans have switched to red. Could be cause for optimism.Make their fantasies come true.Or, don‚Äôt be mistaken for them (like a Hawaiian shirt). But again, nothing conscious. It could still signify submission.Butbut, I‚Äôm the only musician I know who still drives one, and it occasionally generates remark‚Äînothing direct, just noting the persistence of it, an insistent redness in a time when even McDonalds has gone gray.

        ‚ÄúAre we doomed?‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a great question. On the one hand, we are not sending Federal troops to Tennessee to kill Confederates. We are not drafting 2 million men and sending them into the trenches of France, or drafting ten million men and sending them to Normandy and the Bulge. We are not doing duck-and-cover nuclear drills or building backyard bomb shelters. We do not have 25% unemployment.It‚Äôs been a lot worse in the past.On the other hand, we are ruled by a feckless, arrogant and hubristic elite that wants to destroy our energy supply, import tens of millions of brown people, kill white babies, have women command battleships, thinks ‚Äúgender is fluid,‚Äù and is completely subservient to Israel. We are $35 trillion in debt and adding another trillion every three months. The median house price is $430,000 and the median car price is $50,000.Obviously this cannot go on forever, but when and how does it end?From the historian‚Äôs perspective, someone is always doomed, and someone is always succeeding. I am increasingly thinking that us white dissidents are going to end up like the Confederate veterans of 1870.Weare fucked.On the other hand‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs never been a better time to be a lesbian, a black, an illegal alien, or a quarter-black, half-Subcontinental whore.Theyare doing fine.

            ‚ÄúWe do not have 25% unemployment‚ÄùI‚Äôd argue it would be that high if you understood how many do nothing fake jobs exist in the private sector, usually attached to some democrat supported industry: Healthcare, higher education, a good deal of tech, local, state, and federal government. Plus you don‚Äôt see the programs in those industries that employ people not even good enough for the do nothing jobs (optics). Perhaps you don‚Äôt see them on cable television (too expensive for poor people) but you‚Äôll see them on the free internet TV (tubi, pluto) want to get paid to spend time with grandma? Apply now to be her caregiver! Deflation is going to come one way or another. Why do you think Federal deficits are being run at GFC levels but we aren‚Äôt in a recession huh? 2020 was a financial crisis because the GFC never ended. I will continue to hammer this home because this is what the history books will say 100 years from now, because the people currently running things will not be writing them.

            Yeah, I remember that.  I was in school in the late-60s through the 70s, and none of us, as kids, worried about nuclear war, economic collapse, population explosion, plague, etc.  The Vietnam War was mentioned now and then in school, when it was happening, but we didn‚Äôt dwell on it.As we boys approached the time when we had to register for the draft (I was in the first cohort for that), wedidthink a bit about getting into a war in Iran.  Jimmy Carter was hopeless, and many of us knew it.  But it wasn‚Äôt like these things hanged over our heads at that age.  Gasoline prices were an issue, since they inhibited cruising around town, and for adults, they were a big issue, as Z mentioned.Z is also right that TV programs like ‚ÄúThe Day After‚Äù were promoted, at least, as anti-Reagan propaganda.  Some people saw through it at the time.  Not that nuclear war is to be desired, but a lot of the anti-right propaganda was very heavy-handed back then, as it is now.

                I remember being at least marginally frightened of nuclear war in the 70s and early 80s. And I had a cousin, who was more like an older brother, who was borderline obsessed with the topic.
To wit, one summer evening in 1981 we were in my backyard stargazing with my telescope. Peter had his eye to the eyepiece when he suddenly bellowed and jumped backward. I asked what was the matter. He said he thought he saw a nuclear explosion. It was a flash of lightning far to the southwest.

                    I think that one big difference, back in the 70s and 80s, was that adults were clearly more in charge. And unless you believed the dominant liberal media of the time, which many people unfortunately did, this made a difference in outlook. I was fortunate to have conservative parents and grandparents who distrusted the news media and Hollywood.A Pelosi or Biden or Kamala wouldn‚Äôt have been taken as seriously, as Z suggested. Presidents such as Nixon were willing to make constructive dialog with the Soviets. Reagan, for all the rhetoric, also was willing to find accommodation. And, for all their real mistakes, they and many of their advisers were concerned with having a sound economy and a reasonably tranquil society. LBJ, although he had been somewhat of a pragmatist, went off the deep end with the Great Society and Vietnam, falling for very foolish advice, but many presidents were not ideologues. The media termites have steadily done their damage, though.

                The propaganda is indeed heavy handed, but also quite unrealistic as in not based upon science.  The 60‚Äôs movie ‚ÄúOn the Beach‚Äù being one of those.  In that movie the end of mankind came after a nuke exchange, but in the form a radiation rather than physical destruction.  I remember as a child a discussion between my father and a good friend of his discussing this movie and the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù of such nuke weapon use.  My father in his blunt, crude, and I suppose ‚Äúignorance‚Äù simply replied ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù to his friend‚Äôs hysteria.I remembered this exchange when yet again it came about many years later when Carl Sagan‚Äîthat fraud‚Äîresurrected this old idea in the new pseudo-scientific form of ‚ÄúNuclear Winter‚Äù.  Annihilation by radiation being debunked by then.  And of course, it was a ‚Äútwofer‚Äù of sorts since it meant the death of the entire planet‚Äôs flora and fauna, as at that time we were just beginning to enter the ‚ÄúGaia‚Äù worship (Earth Day) era.Now of course, we have moved on to another FUD‚ÄîClimate Change!  Grifters gotta grift and hysterics gotta panic.And so it goes.

                    Sagan certainly was a fraud, thank you.  Unfortunately he drew a huge, admiring crowd.  I wonder who PBS is now pushing as his successor.  Is that black astronomer still a thing?
Anecdotally, I heard second-hand that Sagan was pompous and arrogant. Not too surprising, I guess.  A college student admirer of Sagan who was to help him get to a lecture had his bubble burst.

        It is both ironic and predictable that at a time we are closer to nuclear war than ever before, the popular culture doesn‚Äôt focus on a military-related Doomsday scenarios any longer. The Tribe that controls popular, academic and official information, even if less so than in the past, wants to foment the idea of consequence-free military aggression. Instead, we see fears of ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and so forth pushed to make coin. Actual threats that enrich those who control all information are minimized.Economic instability and mass migration along with the incompetence you mentioned loom large as actual disasters, so therefore they are ignored if noticed at all. It is a miracle that, to date, the greed-drenched bumbling that is Project Ukraine has not resulted in mushroom clouds. One day the luck will end, either with nuclear war or with steady and slow financial and/or demographic collapse. It feels close, whether it is or not, because a quick trip to Walmart makes it impossible to ignore competence, racial and financial realities despite the information blockade.

        ‚ÄúEven so, there are reasons to be worried. The behavior of the authorities in response to the floods in Appalachia underscore the fact that our government is not very good at doing basic things anymore. The main road was washed out and no one thinks it will be replaced in their lifetime. The reason for that is we drive over torn up roads every day that never seem to get repaired properly.‚ÄúThat said, doomsday seems to be a part of the American DNA.‚ÄùPerhaps there are two separate things ‚Äî on the one hand, expecting conditions to get steadily worse and on the other, expecting some apocalyptic end? The former probably can‚Äôt be denied by most observers. As Charles Hugh Smith pointed out two or three years back, the USA is steadily losing first-world capabilities. The same seems to be true across the pond as well, in western Europe.What‚Äôs interesting for me is the increasing divergence between the paper USA ‚Äî the USA of fake economic statistics and a gargantuan mountain of fictitious capital on the one hand, and a brittle, stagnant, deteriorating society, real economy, and physical infrastructure on the other. It‚Äôs the brittleness that‚Äôs a sight to behold ‚Äî the federal government looks like it simply can‚Äôt respond to emergencies like hurricanes, nor their aftermaths.

                I hope you are right, but I don‚Äôt know.   Clearly the regime can move the 82nd Airborne to Haiti in 48 hours after an earthquake, but not across North Carolina after a week to help with disaster relief.  I think they don‚Äôt really give a shit.  I bet if those hill people had been shooting at feds a task force would be dealing with them within a couple of days.In re the mediocre federal response to the hurricane floods: I took leave to help with earthquake disaster relief when I was on active duty- I thought of it as a high point of my service ‚Äî and that was for Italians, not my countrymen. To be an active duty servicemember in North Carolina or Georgia sitting on a base with all kinds of equipment that could be used for search and rescue or recovery and just sitting on my ass would be infuriating.  How inspirational would it have been to see the US Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines showing up actually using their energy and dedication in service to their people?   An opportunity blown by administration/regime to show them actually caring about Americans.(it occurred to me when I typed ‚Äúopportunity blown‚Äù that this time it is not to Kamala‚Äôs advantage.  Would AI have generated that sentence?)

I don‚Äôt think anyone can defend those terms for interracial inter religious crowds.here‚Äôs my humble definition of what is called America:A bordered crowd.I like the term ‚Äúthe voters‚Äù. It reminds me of the equally funny term, ‚ÄúAmerican passport holders‚Äù.I had a brief back and forth with a guy who claimed to have a masters degree in philosophy from Catholic university in dc. He commented that a nation or country or even a people is individuals living in the jurisdictional boundaries of a country and subject to the laws of that country. THIS he says , makes ‚Äúa‚Äù people.i replies that i lived in XXXXX for nine months. When you are in another country you are subject to its laws. Was I, for those nine months an XXXXian? Did I cease to be an American? Was I both ?CAN I be both?the mind of the white man is seriously degraded if this is masters degree level thinking.

            Sounds like you were speaking to a civic nationalist Christian (Catholic). He likely carries a vial of Blessed Magic Dirt around his neck.

        I listen to EMJ, because he makes me think. Not a sycophant, nor am I going to pollute this comment section critiquing him. Anyway, he‚Äôs been talking about American identity.He‚Äôs big on narrative, which he admits, being a PhD in American Lit, iirc. Daniel Boone and the cowboy. These are boomer phenomena, I don‚Äôt say that as a put down.I ask myself what my identity as an American is. Didn‚Äôt think much about it as a kid, I just knew I was one. Yet, a strong sense of alienation, which I chalked up to being weird, and, honestly, extraordinarily intelligent. (That‚Äôs what everyone told me, school was easy and boring, high test scores without trying very hard, so I figure it‚Äôs true. Whatever.)Lately, I start to wonder if that sense of alienation wasn‚Äôt just my thing. In middle age, I start to think being an American means the flood and drowning. Being told what you are by people who don‚Äôt understand you, and if you assert yourself, you‚Äôre racist-sexist-homophobic-antisemitic. Even satanic I guess lol.So maybe older people feel doom, and I suppose rightly so, but I just want to breathe, to know what that feels like, not sure I ever knew. I thought that was an American‚Äôs birthright. If you‚Äôve ever almost drowned, you know what a desperate feeling that is.Maybe a so-called Xennial perspective, idk. Not talking radical freedom either. To breathe, as an American.

                That‚Äôs one way, but another is to develop a high sense of brotherhood, or ethnocentrism.  Look at India for an example and its caste system.  Remove race for the time.  There are several high IQ castes, Brahmins being one of the better known.  The swim in a ‚Äúsea of muds‚Äù as you put it, but reproduce among themselves and are in a sense quite ethnocentric in their dealings.  Over a millennia they‚Äôve survived intact.
We perhaps can never get there, but it doesn‚Äôt require a White homeland.

            EMJ has descended into intellectual dishonesty. He avoids race by claiming whites are defined by their ancestors‚Äô specific nation-state origins rather than their indigenous European DNA. He has finally acknowledged weaponized migration but dodges the key role played by the current pope, Catholic charities, and other church-related organizations and efforts. He prefers to focus on the actual and true Jewish hand in weaponized migration rather than the treachery of his church, which along with white Protestants have played supporting roles. He recently was on a podcast with a white, staunchly Catholic Irishwoman who refused to play along with his dodgy bullshit.

                In my city, the Catholic and Lutheran churches have been at the forefront of encouraging immigration, and working closely with the Democratic city government and NGOs to increase this as much as possible.  Immigrants get everything they want, including lavish, years‚Äô long welfare benefits, and subsidies from the NGOs.  I‚Äôll take the old Mayor-Daley-style corruption over this kind of criminality.

                Seems to me he‚Äôs running black outreach since he was on Whitlock, which is forcing him to stake out positions that are alienating to his core people.Kind of like Republicans going for more than 13% or so black support, and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got to say about it!I like his focus on ethnicity, though. I think race is real but too broad to be very useful, plus ethnicity brings culture into the discussion.I imagine when people were fretting over Italians and English, or whatever, getting married, the thought of black and white was shocking. White really isn‚Äôt a thing without black, so to speak. Question is if the genie is out of the bottle. Idk. This Tower of Babel business is a bunch of crap!

            So much that we‚Äôre witnessing seems unprecedented.   There were mass migrations that helped bring down the Roman Empire, but those Germanic migrants deep down weren‚Äôt that different from the Romans.  Not like the migrants of today.Some rulers in the past were destructive and craven, but I can‚Äôt think of any who were as willing to destroy their own people as ours are.And the massive attempts by today‚Äôs ruling classes to turn morality upside-down.

                    It may be the death of Christianity. Love or hate it, it has been one of the pillars of an advanced civilized society. The Gaia loving pagans will likely go back to human sacrifices to appease their new god.

I get the sentiment, but it‚Äôs already being done.  What do you call abortion‚Äîespecially late term abortion?  Baal smiles.  What do you call transgendering children starting as young as 6-8 yo followed by medical enhancement?
It‚Äôs here, just in a bit different in form as from the ancients.

            This futurewasseen.William S. Burroughs‚Äôs vision (extrapolated from then-present Tangier‚Äôs international zone) was a dystopian tranny crimescape‚Äîa universal ‚Äúracial jungle,‚Äù one might say‚Äîheld in suppression by a messy conspiracy of drugged doctors, etc. His books are strange and difficult so almost nobody remembers them, and /ourguys/ are only interested in skimming author bios for any reason to call a writer a loser, so they have no idea. What would an obscurely intelligence-affiliated homosexual pedophile who gets away with murder know about thereal world?At about the same time, Philip K. Dick foresaw (observed, crazily) the dystopian uses of data, from ‚Äútotal observation‚Äù to exterminating the public mind.The old guys I know who are implementing current_year‚Äôs horrors were, when we were young, fans of both authors. They have no idea what they‚Äôre doing.

        AFAIK, the banks failing is very realistic.  If there was a run on the bank, the banks would all go bankrupt.  They‚Äôre loaded up on low interest bonds and mortgages.  If they had to sell these on the open market, they would get a major haircut due to the low interest rate of the bonds and mortgages compared to the current bond rate.AFAIK, this is what happened to those 2 banks that failed in 2023.  All the tech people started wanting their deposits and those bonds were not worth anywhere near face value.  AFAIK, nothing has changed in the banks.How this would affect America‚Äôs economy is a mystery to me as is what the government and fed would do were this scenario start to play out.  My guess is they would find a way to stop it.  Maybe a 2 week bank holiday or something?  Massive money printing?  Endless assurances the FDIC would cover all losses (with printed money as they don‚Äôt have enough saved)?

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶doomsday seems to be a part of the American DNA.‚ÄùFUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) sells.  It‚Äôs simply another way of expressing a continuous topic we discuss here‚Äîemotion vs rational‚Äîdecision making.  The PTB have used this for years to persuade the masses to back them in whatever efforts *they* decide upon, not necessarily in the peoples‚Äô best interest.Doubt my analysis?  Look at the media, if you‚Äôve a strong stomach, and check out the current political ad‚Äôs.  I have yet to see one, yes just one, that discusses the candidates policy goals.  Every single ad is a hysterical warning of how the opposition candidate will do harm to you and yours if they are elected.  Pure FUD.I remember such even as a youngster during the Cold War.  Always the threat of Communism and enslavement and that the threat to ‚Äúout way of life‚Äù if we didn‚Äôt fight it around the world (better there than here).  Now as I look around and reflect, we live under a system of surveillance and corruption of the courts that would make a ‚ÄúStalin‚Äù envious.  But as the proverbial ‚Äúfrog in the pot‚Äù, we are/were oblivious, and it‚Äôs perhaps too late.And so it goes.

            A lot of that has its roots in fundraising. You raise a lot more funds by scaring the donors than you do by outlining your 7 point plan. As political campaigns have become more expensive, the scare tactics have ramped up proportionally. Some percentage of our political division is attributable merely to this.

                With a bit of irony, I recall the Cold War.  One difference is that then the Russians were as afraid as we were of escalation.  In the back of their minds could be the thought, is it worth it?  Does the West really want to turn such into a ‚Äúhot‚Äù war and invade/destroy us?  Best control this situation.  D√©tente was the cry of the day.Now the Russians have *zero* doubt of our (neocons) intentions.  We, in essence, have attacked through our proxy Ukraine.  The world will never be the same as back in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs. Our intentions have been revealed and Russia is back to rearming and rebuilding on such understanding.

        It‚Äôs really since the plandemic that a lot of folks have been waiting for the other shoe to drop. This was what brought a proliferation of the survivalist/prepper industry. You even see ads for prepper food storage on normie tv now, during sportsball games. Or are those targeted at me personally by the AI ad generator? Pretty sure it‚Äôs the former, but not discounting the possibility of the latter.Maybe 1/3 of the population didn‚Äôt buy what the regime was pushing and that‚Äôs a lot of people. Their fears are not baseless. The discerning person, having recently witnessed the Russia hoax and the plandemic, among other things, knows that the regime‚Äôs mendacity is bottomless, and justifiably asks ‚Äúif they‚Äôll do that, what won‚Äôt they do?‚Äù

What we may get is a slide into misery over many generations. If whites get bred out or become too small a population, we will go the way of India. But that takes many generations. And on the other side, like it or not, technology continues to advance. And there are still a lot of smart people in the world.

            Your past experience as a Baby Boomer says very little about the future.

I mean, mRNA vaccines and all that, right? Another app on my phone just got updated!There‚Äôs still a lot of smart people out there, let‚Äôs not be negative, they‚Äôll think of something, probably using the technology they invented because they are smart.No way, man.

                I‚Äôm not a baby boomer I just know some history. But as far as technology, I mean it‚Äôs not like you are responding on this site with parchment carried by Pony Express. You are literally using 21st century technology that requires an understanding of quantum physics to work. My claim is that people hoping for a technological collapse are the ones hoping for the hand of God to come save the day.

That‚Äôs collective mind reading. How would you know such a thing? These are nonsensical statements. They are meaningless generalities expressing what you think large numbers of other people think. Air from a hair dryer.Now, if you could do this, I‚Äôd listen: ‚ÄúHey Art, meet Bob. Bob, tell the man what you think.‚ÄùBob: ‚ÄúI am hoping for a technological collapse and also hoping for the hand of God to come save the day.‚ÄùThen I‚Äôll believe you.

                        Oh gotcha, you can do collective mind reading of older folks like you did in your original post, but I can‚Äôt when responding to it. Totally makes sense. But none of that changes the fact that you use far more technology today than you did 10 years ago.  And you will use even more a decade from now.

                    Technological collapse, or at least subsidence, will occur in tandem with congnitive decline, which is already in its infancy. At some point very soon we will reach Peak Technology, if we haven‚Äôt already.

                ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still a lot of smart people out there,¬†‚ÄúThere are, but what are the numbers of such people?  In there lies the rub, or perhaps more appropriately stated the concept/theory of the ‚ÄúCritical Fraction‚ÄùI stated this before, so won‚Äôt bore folks with elaboration, but in short the theory discusses how many of such ‚Äúsmart‚Äù folk are needed for a 1st class technical society to thrive and just how smart they must be.When the number falls below the Critical Fraction, we begin to see the signs of  deterioration/collapse‚Äîless innovation, more infrastructure failure, less successful medical treatment, more internal strife, etc.Like climate, this doesn‚Äôt manifest observably over night, but when it is apparent, it‚Äôs too late.  At that point the society reverts from 1st world to 3rd world.And so it goes.

                        This is indeed correct, but that could be due to lowered admission standards and increased enrollment.  Producing, last I read, a frightening/depressing statistic‚ÄîMillennials are the most ‚Äúdegreed‚Äù cohort in history, with something like 40% having a post secondary degree.In the above sense, our ‚Äúsmart‚Äù people are not as smart as before, but simply the recipient of worthless pieces of paper in faux degree areas.  The situation is that we now have college attendees with an IQ as low as 105 or a bit above normal.  Those people are simply not to be classified as smart, they are equivalent to the ‚Äúscarecrow‚Äù of the Wizard of OZ.  College for them is at *best*, what HS completion was to the ‚ÄúGreatest Generation‚Äù, or even my generation of early Boomers.But how about those college attendees with a more traditional IQ of 120-125?  They would be in the top 10% of the population and would be those who could master a solid STEM curriculum.  These we might conclude are within the ‚ÄúSmart Fraction‚Äù.   What are their numbers?  Have they declined for whatever reason?I suspect a decline, but those are the numbers we must look at rather than a simple overview of all college attendees which is misleading wrt CF theory.

                Genes matter more than culture or economy.  Big economic crash? Even if it happens, so what?  Russia had a hard landing and they have crawled out of it. Japan and Germany were destroyed after WW2 but they were back humming along 10 years later. If you have the right genes you can do that. The reason I say India is because there used to be white indo-europeans that ran the place and they had a thriving culture. But they mixed with the locals and 2,000 years of stagnation followed.

                    India is not a good example without careful clarification. India had and still has a ‚Äúcaste‚Äù system which had a few of the upper castes holding all the ‚Äúright‚Äù genes.

                            The best thing I encountered with such Indians‚Äîwe had many in the dept‚Äîwas their arranged marriages.  I was invited to one, but hesitated to visit India.From what I gleaned, the Indians I encountered were philosophical on the practice and did not seem to object.  These things were common and the parents were in a better position to judge compatibility than two hormonally challenged teens.  Additionally the families choose each other on those aspects aside from sex and hotness.  There is strength in numbers and an implied reciprocity between families in economic matters and such.Welcome to the Middle Ages in Europe. Not everything was bad and some things should have never been abandoned.

                    Germany and Japan also had merciful and advanced conquerors to lift them out of the murk. The US and allies felt that it didn‚Äôt make sense for the defeated nations to become basket cases. Will the Russians, Chinese, Iranians, and Indians feel the same and undertake a ‚ÄúMarshall Plan‚Äù to help us out or will they gloat and laugh?
Also, as others have pointed out, the US gene pool is increasingly polluted with low-IQ ethnics who may not be able to make use of a Marshall Plan type rescue effort.

                It‚Äôs remarkable how a handful of crappy books from almost 60 years ago live in on the minds of that generation. One can see why they made the decisions they did. A few stupid best-sellers like The Population Bomb that fizzled out in their predictions ‚Äî surprise! predictions! ‚Äî gave them the greenlight to run roughshod over the US for the next 35 years as they held those books up to every critic like garlic in front of vampires. Any noticeable political, economic, and social sign of decay was met with these books and a six-pack of Hopium from Budweiser with Reagan on the label.And that‚Äôs why we get the ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt happen‚Äù business from dudes who haven‚Äôt been in the workplace or worried much about money since the early 1990s. They live in a different world and their experience with money at this point is whether to give the Mexican roofers an extra $10 or $20.

            Outside of software and computer chips, technology really hasn‚Äôt advanced all that much since the 1970s. Certainly, relative to the dizzying pace of technological change from say 1900-1970, it has stagnated. This is reflected in the zeitgeist of both eras. Back then, people expected a more ‚Äúspace age‚Äù future because it was happening all around them all the time. Today, people expect a future of stagnation and decay, because it‚Äôs happening around them all the time.

                Well there is a theory that all the things you mentioned up until about 1970 were the low hanging fruit of real world technology, so to speak.  But since that time the focus has been on computers and the digital revolution.  Technology follows an s-curve. A particular technology or industry doesn‚Äôt improve rapidly forever. After it matures, a lot of the energy moves to other areas. We went from building faster rockets to building faster computers. So you can‚Äôt have a flying car to get to Japan in an hour. But you can FaceTime them in the next 5 minutes without leaving your home.

                    A slow down in innovation is one thing. Stagnation is another. Total collapse is yet another.  There‚Äôs a big difference between those three things is what I‚Äôm trying to say. Technological innovation in cars has slowed down. But a car today better than one from 20 years ago, not to mention 40 years ago.

                        The cars are indeed better. However, when something goes wrong with one, you can‚Äôt just pop the hood in your driveway and affect repairs economically like you could in the old days. Instead, you‚Äôve got to take it to the shop and take out a loan for them to replace a headlight. What‚Äôs more, your car is spying on you. The ‚Äô62 Dodge Polara shakes its grill in horror.

                            I‚Äôve also mused upon this over the years.  I remember when cars‚Äîespecially American‚Äîsucked.  The poor quality issues ebb and flow over the years of course.  However, when we bought an American auto years (generations) ago, you paid relatively little and could repair them much more cheaply.Now of course, cars are much improved, but much more expensive‚Äîand with this generation unrepairable by the common man.  Cost is not due strictly to inflation and improvement‚Äîbut to government mandates, especially safety.  Is such worth it? Do you have a say in equipping your car without such mandates?  Of course not.  In the ‚Äúnanny state‚Äù you have little say in ‚Äúrisk avoidance‚Äù.The effect being that today, the typical new auto is unaffordable by the average American, and the used car market continues to shrink due to less purchases and shortened longevity of the product.  In a generation we will have fewer people driving because no one can afford to.I suspect that‚Äôs the real plan behind government auto mandates and new State taxing proposals‚Äîto drive up costs, reduce ownership/usage, and control movement within and outside cities.Henry Ford is spinning in his grave!

                To go from no aircraft in 1900 to going to the moon in 1970 is a staggering achievement.  They designed and operated some of these air/spacecraft with computers but of course lower on the technological scale.  They used mostly just white men and slide rules.   We are still flying many of these designs from that timeframe- the F 16, F 15, C-130,etc   Television and mass radio came about in that time frame.   Of course a lot of it couldn‚Äôt have been done without those Hidden Figures gals.  (My boomer co-worker actually believes that fable)In contrast, we have been on-line for 30 years now.  The method of accessing the internet has changed of course but in many ways it is still the same internet as it was when I dialed in at 1200 baud in the mid 90s, using Netscape.  Blackberry put out the first smart phone maybe 20 years ago and then the I phone came along in 2007.   Better cameras and all that but still‚Ä¶   Technologically things seem to have slowed down.

            The only countries that actually collapse are the stupid ones, the grotesquely imperial ones, or the ones that suffered a horrific unforeseen event.Stupid: the Mayans, Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia.Grotesquely Imperial: Roman Empire, Qing China, the Ottomans, the USSR.Horrific Unforeseen Event: The Hittites, The Aztecs, Austria-Hungary.Whether you collapse completely or decline and get stuck in a rut depends highly on the locals who remain. Unless the locals are terminally stupid, I guess that life goes on, however uncomfortably, for a few centuries. My guess is the Western world declines and gets stuck in a rut. I imagine that much of Europe functions and smells like Turkey and North America functions and smells like Brazil or Mexico. It‚Äôll be okay, but certainly not glorious.Japan, Korea, and China are a different matter. They will carry on well, but without the continued innovation from the West that drove them to prosperity. They‚Äôll be the civilized standards but they‚Äôll get fossilized over time, like Asians tend to become.

It‚Äôs a tired old saw that they ‚Äústole‚Äù all our technology and would be nothing without the West‚Äôs science. This needs qualification because it begs/assumes the question of future innovation. The scientific publications and patents given to the East Asians, last I read, exceeded the West. Faculty I‚Äôve known have for years jointly published with Chinese colleagues.These things would leave me to wonder if we‚Äôve simply handed the ‚Äúbaton‚Äù of scientific innovation over to them. Time will tell.

        Yep, logic says Doomed.  We‚Äôre facing the worst demographics imaginable, and have been for a long time.  Second, the U.S. ‚Äúelite‚Äù are the worst people imaginable ‚Äì possibly the worst people on Earth.  For a current example, the government isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfailing‚Äù to respond to the disasters ‚Äì they are responding exactly as they intent to.  This doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre competent to do a better job ‚Äì they‚Äôre probably not ‚Äì but they want those people to die.  Someday I hope someone important has the balls to publicly call it murder.  Zog is an evil regime and it makes the world a worse place and has been doing so for more than a hundred years.  My American pride has been replaced by shame.As for the pervasiveemotionalsense of doom, how much of that is a kind of wishful thinking?  Doom would go a long way to wiping out that demographic problem mentioned earlier.  If the disaster is bad enough, outsiders stop coming in.  Maybe some people who shouldn‚Äôt be here go away.  Maybe the authorities can no longer really stop you from ‚Äúcleaning up‚Äù your neighborhood.  Nobody has to worry about what the various types of ‚Äúvictims‚Äù have to say any more, because when Doom comes nobody has to care that your great-great-grand-daddy was a slave or your HIV meds cost too much or somebody said a No-No Word in your presence.  In short, when Doom comes, everybody gets a license to say ‚ÄúF*CK YOU‚Äù and start looking out for their own interests without a daily guilt trip from the Usual Suspects.I feel the Doom in part because, even though I‚Äôd probably die, part of me really wants Doom to cure the intense feeling of betrayal and disappointment that came from learning the great country I thought I lived in as a kid was, and is, a lie.  Doom is bad for my self-interest, but again ‚Äì part of me wants to see D.C. get nuked and enjoy it for a moment before I get vaporized myself.

        Today‚Äôs young people (&lt;35) seem to be particularly prone to anxiety. Their brains have been toasted by the massive vaccine assault that started in the late 1980s and the junk food that is now the standard American diet. Many of them are drug abusers (marijuana in particular) and have been raised in the sketchy family arrangements that are now ubiquitous. The economic prospects for many are dismal, with a future of low-paying jobs and living with mom and dad in store. Throw in the obvious misgovernment of the country and the chronic warfare that invites WW III and you have a recipe for pessimism and doomsday thinking. Who could blame them?

            Warday by Whitley Streiber and James Kunetka is another great post nuclear apocalypse novel.  Warday is strictly realistic, however, without the supernatural elements of the Stand and Swan Song.  Also, Warday depicts a limited nuclear exchange rather than an all out nuclear conflict.  The United States survives, albeit the U.S. that remains is a de facto balkanized country that is a Third World power at best.

        Late to this comment thread but the two ‚Äúend of the world‚Äù movies that I remember wereOn the Beach(came out in 1959) andThe Omega Man(came out 1971).  In the fomer a global nuclear war has created such elevated levels of radiation that they kill all human life.  They are slowly drifting to the southern hemisphere where an American nuclear-powered submarine is sent to the north to investigate a strange radio signal, which turns out to be meaningless.  And in the end, humanity is extinguished.  In the latter, a biological war has turned most humans into quasi-vampires, although exactly what illness they have is unclear.  There is one really interesting scene between Matthias, the head of a vampire clan called The Family (played by Anthony Zerbe, who really deserved a best supporting actor Oscar for his performance) and Richard Neville (played by Charlton Heston) where Matthias says that they need to go back and start again, understanding when ‚Äútechnology threatened more than it offered.‚ÄùAs the Z-man says, the scenario for a war between Iran and its allies and Israel/United States has the potential to inflict huge damage on the world and its economy.  The longer-term issue is that the BRICS countries are developing a payment system in which the dollar will be bypassed for an increasing number of transactions, weakening its role as the global reserve currency and making it increasingly difficult to finance the huge deficits.

        I love the doomsday game.Planet of the Apes: The ruling class of the West smashed themselves to bits in two great wars that caused all their loyal dogs to die (in one sense or another), so they decided to replace said dogs by uplifting apes from Africa and Asia who then took over civilization on them. Fancy that.Terminator II: In the aftermath of the 9/11 holocaust, the security state took over and started hunting down dissidents with machine-like ruthlessness using computer algorithms as their preferred troops.Y2K: As good a date as any for the death of Heritage America, the end of a world, even though the fatal wounds were delivered decades earlier. See also the above.Orwell, 1984 and the like: Everywhere and readily acknowledged.The Walking Dead, Resident Evil, zombies: A mind virus, designated WOKE, infected huge swathes of the population, decaying their mind, morals and spirit flesh until they became shitlib NPCs who hate the living and attack normal, healthy people on sight. Sometimes coalesce into feral mobs that run rampant through cities.Soylent Green: Is TV game shows, Reality TV, social media, corporate retreads. Why have a real culture when you can just eat the reprocessed remains of your neighbors and ancestors for all eternity?Matrix, Fight Club, Office Space, others: Corporations have taken over America and reshaped our perception of reality. What do?Bonus Round: Aliens are other races for people who do not think they are racist and demons for people who think they are too sophisticated to believe in demons. Have fun with all the alien invasion flicks and movies like Andromeda Strain, Alien.To start: Meteorites are angels cast down to earth, so the vibranium that powers Wakanda is demonic material.America and her ruling class were warned, but warnings are no longer needed when the storm makes landfall. Evil men always learn the wrong lessons in victory. Always.

                Our doomsday ‚Äúgame‚Äù scenarios have indeed expanded with our modern imaginations colored by expanded knowledge of nature through science.  However, the psychology behind such seems older than the modern settings you depict.

                    The psychology behind our doomsday games is deep, and perhaps a bit more grounded than you let on. Movies are the dreams of America. Sometimes of Hollywood and sometimes from the greater collective. Most of my list are movies that reinterpret existing dynamics and trends in order to express problems the population should be aware of and address. The doomsday nature is an expression of urgency and exaggeration for clarity at the cost of material accuracy. Soylent Green was likely tapping into cultural trends showing up in 1973 and earlier. The Matrix reimagining cubicle farms powering our soulless corporate overlords as battery towers for soulless machine overlords is not that profound and certainly not prescient, although the note about humanity darkening the skies was a subtle nod to the Christian lore in a movie plagiarizing the messiah narrative shamelessly and crudely.Terminator II is the one that should keep you up at night. How did a movie from 1991 predict the security state that was not to be born until 2001 so accurately? From the fiery origin to the shapeshifting nature of the enforcer expressing the collective of a well-meaning informant flagging her troubled son for the FBI, the media, and the police officer chasing you on the street. To Sarah ‚Äì the crazy conspiracy theorist asking for the Epstein list or the release of the JFK files or sounding the alarm on the Patriot Act ‚Äì being restrained and medicated by the experts while she was the one with an accurate enough grasp of the present and future.How much of that existed in 1991? How much was the logical extrapolation of existing trends? How much of that was an oracle being touched by the other side?

                        I remembered a few more details from Terminator 2.The T-800 has aspects of it that reflect the old enforcer, the old internet, and the old system siding with the dissident. The T-1000 is the new enforcer, the new internet, and the new system tasked with terminating the dissident. The T-800 has to be destroyed as the last chip, which is to say, the logic of the old ways invariably lead to the new. The dissident has to let go of the old ways for a clean future.If you want to make a case for diversity being tasked with creating the new system by Silicon Valley and the like, you may. Shame about their end though.The queen mother in the Biblical narrative of the kings of Israel is a stand-in for the often evil spirit of the age which controls the king. Sarah Conner is the spirit mother of the dissident whereas the foster mother is the spirit mother of the normie who just so happens to kill her husband while he is drinking milk.Terminator 2: Judgment Day is close to the ideal film for a dissident in his formative years, and prophetic dreams do not get much better either.

        I. I think the financial collapse happened in 2008. It‚Äôs taken a massive expansion of debt to keep it from running its course. All of this is still going on, 16(!) years later.Somebody (Citizen? apologies if that‚Äôs wrong) on here points out that the world still doing business in dollars gives the US an unlimited credit card. It‚Äôs an unbelievable situation, really.Maybe it‚Äôs a long draw down, a soft landing. Idk. Maybe it‚Äôs the only way to avoid the wars and tragedies these things cause. You notice things started getting dicey around the same time the fed started raising interest rates. OTOH, we risk being more exhausted than we‚Äôd be after a disaster.To the point of the post and podcast, only certain doom would make bleeding out the more reasonable, if still desperate, option, but then you have to ask yourself if the threat is real, or just something people have been programmed to expect.II. For whatever reason, this discussion has got me thinking of the notion of a linear, progressive time. I‚Äôm pretty sure we got it from Christianity, which got it from the Hebrews. I know it‚Äôs not this simple, but I think it has to be the ultimate source of the idea that we have to keep moving forward, that we can count on some breakthrough, that pushing limits will force a breakthrough. The End is chasing us to The End. I‚Äôve never liked it.

        Although monsters lurk in the unlikeliest of places, no one really believes they will encounter one. Historically speaking, however, we should be on a crash collision course with a monster ‚Äî a world-bestselling conqueror.The 1930s had Adolf Hitler. The 1810s had Napoleon Bonaparte. Ever since the Industrial Revolution began, we have had one monster a century.The world conqueror, schooled in politics and nursed on the milk of mass media, wears a benevolent smile.What can today‚Äôs monster be waiting for?The development and perfection of an anti-ballistic missile shield. Once nuclear weapons are neutralized, mass armies are free to march again ‚Ä¶‚Äî Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            He is here. His name is Xi. The amount of subversive control they have over our politics is enormous. I recommend him the book unrestricted warfare, written by PLA officers outlining how it could be done while avoiding a disastrous war that could go nuclear.
