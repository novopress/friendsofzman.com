        Frankly, there’s too much of everything these days, except for competence and level-headedness in government circles.  I counted up the college bowl games and there’s 49 of them – 49!  And most of the sponsors you’ve probably never heard of.    It used to be a matter of honor to qualify for one, now it’s like who doesn’t get in?  In my neck of the woods we have the “snoop diggity dog Arizona bowl presented by gin &amp; juice dr. dre and snoop” – sounds like a real winner – lol.

            Personally I’ve always preferred the classic contests put on by the Poulan Weedeater Bowl and the Taxslayer.com Bowl.

                The various bowl games are just excuses to rake in the advertising dollars.
Only a die-hard sports fanatic would take them seriously. Watching one is an exercise in patience because not only does the advertiser get his say so, but the sponsor speaks up too, since he has shelled out good fist currency greenbacks for the privilege.

                    Shreveport…it’s a fine town. NOT! Had to fly to nearby Bossier City and Barksdale and always stayed on the post. Not a good liberty town, that’s for sure.
Northern Louisiana is basically southern Arkansas with lots of feral blacks.

                        I once was going through Shreveport and decided to stop and eat in a hurry. I pulled off and stopped at a Church’s, bad move. I was the only pale person within shouting distance. it was daytime fortunately or else I would have got back on 20 and went somewhere else. As it was, I got the food to go and ate while driving.

                            Seeing a white person in a Church’s is a rare event. I am pretty sure the company deliberately locates them in negro heavy areas. You brave the negros to get the chicken, or not.

        From what I see, guys are spending more money than ever on sports. Whether it is gambling, buying incredibly overpriced tickets, the apparel, or the multitude of services like Red Zone, it seems like more of a cash cow than ever.One thing that might spell its doom though is that younger kids don’t have near the interest anymore. There’s still a lot, but gone are the days of sports cards, hanging out with your buds to watch the game, and the frenzy for local teams. They might suck the current adults dry of money, but it likely won’t last for generations.

            The gambling thing has truly killed professional sports for me. When SCOTUS struck down the ban, I thought it meant that I could go to AC or Vegas and have a fun time betting on a couple of games or laying down a couple of props. What it actually meant was that these leagues all turned into casinos that have a suspiciously high amount of influence and power over the future outcomes that people are betting on. The leagues are all in bed with these casino companies, you see a gambling ad every single commercial break, all the sports shows on TV, radio, and podcasts are basically gambling shows.The legitimization and proliferation of gambling is probably the best evidence yet that the government is just another gang of thugs. At least the mafia had the good sense to tuck the bookies in shady bars and keep certain people away from it for their own good.

                Gambling is going to destroy sports. There’s too much money in rigging the games. It’ll be just as notorious as boxing in the Don King era.

                        Players have already been suspended for betting on their own sport, and one guy has already been banned for life for manipulating his own props. I find the idea that nobody is colluding with these companies (that are not shady bookies, they are huge corporations that operate in the open) to be totally implausible. You could be making $50M a year and still end up with a gambling problem – see Phil Mickelson, or Michael Jordan.

                        Yup.
It’s an accepted part of the NBA the refs have supported some star players over others since forever. Heck, once went to a girls high school basketball game where the refs were clearly corrupt.

                        I have a nice MLB team but the last couple of summers started driving around a bit to attend some AAA and AA-league baseball.  It was really great—smaller towns, cheaper tickets, close-up seats at intimate stadiums, paler crowds.

            On local teams, although it’s a common complaint, all my local teams are filled with people with no connection to the area. Even the lower levels are like this. Even the damn colleges are like this since everyone nowadays is a transient that uproots their lives every 5 years for the next big scam. It inspires nothing in me and is difficult to get into. There is no pride in it.
Only thing my family watches is World Cup (mostly for the drama and corruption) and the Thanksgiving parade. No TV, no Netflix, no Prime. Not interested.

                Not since the early 1960s has there been anything resembling a team full of local boys. The joke – which most people don’t want to think about too deeply – is that they’re merely “rooting for laundry”.I grew up in Lagos-on-the-Mississippi (AKA St. Louis) and the sportswriters were always fully erect when a local boy made good in the local laundry. Whitey Herzog, Kurt Warner (kinda), David Freese. They tried to make Dominican baseball players and Slav hockey players wax poetic about STL, but only dull sportsball enjoyers fell for it.Fun fact: Stan Kroenke (owner of the LA Rams) was from Columbia, MO and I remember the local journos making hay of that fact, thinking a Missouri boy would NEVER move a team out of St. Louis. Well, he did!

                The roster mayhem brought on by far too free and easy free agency has destroyed sports at all levels.
In the 50s NHL all the teams were family units that hated all other teams. Detroit, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, and Boston fought wars on the ice.
Now? It’s just a bunch of random meat bots that all go out for drinks after the game because they are bros on social media.

        …owning a team is mostly about tax dodging and rent seeking and you see the problem…
Unless you are the Rooneys, who turned owning the Steelers and local political influence in Pittsburgh into controlling an entire league, and in the process making themselves the Democratic Party kingmakers in Pennsylvania by controlling the billions in the nationwide NFL economy. When you have every Democratic President from Jimmy Carter to Joe Biden pay homage to you, and you have the power to call off the fraud machine in a swing state in 2024, you are more than that.

If a guy wants to watch some TV, Professional Sports doesn’t make fun of him, tell him he’s a loser, nor shoves “Stronk, Induhpendent Whamen!” into his face and down his throat 24/7/365.(Oh theADVERTISEMENTSdo, but what guy watches the ads? Except us, cursed with the ability to notice.

            The NFL became unwatchable when they changed the rules to keep the clock running on out-of-bounds and other plays.  They kept the games at 3 hours, effectively replacing game content with more ads.  On the rare occasion when I watch, it is unbelievable how little action there is.  I can watch maybe a quarter or so, before I switch to a movie.

                Same thing happened with college football. Difference being televised college games tend to run to more like 4 hours, with similar proportional increase in how much of it is advertising. I don’t know how they expect to gain new fans. But I’ve been puzzled by people’s entertainment choices for many, many years.

                It’s even worse in stadium; all of the delays without even a sembelence of entertainment.  Amusingly, the NFL has countered with “club levels,” basically sports bars with really high cover charges.
To me, the worst parts are the instant replay reviews, which add long delays at precisely the wrong moments in the melo-drama that is sports.

        Something weird happened with basketball recently. The NBA signed yet another record TV deal. This by itself is basically business as usual when it comes to sports, as Z indicates. Yet, this deal was signed while the NBA is in the middle of a full throated collapse in ratings. We are talking about 40%-50% declines year-over-year, after last year’s already horrible ratings. The NBA’s signature day of Christmas is now getting eaten alive by the NFL. It seems people have just totally tuned out the NBA, and it isn’t too surprising. The players are just the most unlikeable and obnoxious bunch of people this side of a protest at Oberlin. They don’t play hard, they take half the season off, they whine at any criticism they get, they virtue signal, and they are rewarded with this behavior with tens of millions of dollars. Adam Silver is totally ineffectual as a commissioner, with no idea how to keep the players in line to make a better product (this was David Stern’s great skill). The entire league seems to have landed on a single style of play and it’s a bad, unfun one to watch. It’s truly unwatchable.So the question is why did the broadcasters pay the NBA all this money for such a junk product? The best reason I heard is that the ratings might be bad, but they are at least somewhat predictable and it is a product that fills tons of hours that need to get filled. That is where we are at now with sports broadcasting and broadcasting in general – the sport might be junk nobody watches, but at least it exists. The record contract is cheaper and produces more predictable results than having to fill those hours with content.

            Consider the possibility that sportsball is at least somewhat subsidized, much as broadcast media in general is, because the circuses must go on, just as the propaganda must be propagated. Some of the same fedloldollars that prop up the networks can be redirected to prop up the circuses. It is not a big leap, after you notice all the sportsball stadiums paid for with public funds.

It’s because they are not just paying for the live broadcasts, but also highlights, access to players/coaches, and (while probably not explicitly in the contract) tip offs of “breaking news”. Essentially 24/7/365 content to fill not just TV but also their online properties as well.

        This post touches on something that the entire current global system is desperate to avoid thinking about, which is that the current cycle is about to turn over over and the end of the constant growth of the last couple of centuries is nearly upon us.The global population will probably peak within the next 2 decades, possibly even 1. At that point, or even before(do even the morons in charge think Africa is going to be a comparable market to the West or Asia?), so many of the current systems that are based on more, More, MORE are not going to be functional anymore. Entertainment is a bellwether of this since oversaturation is already occurring and new audiences aren’t being born.The concept of contraction is foreign to a massive percentage of the current population, as it has been generations since anyone in the West has experienced it without it being papered over. It’s not surprising that Buffett has Berkshire like 1/3 in cash right now, he knows what’s coming once the cancerous fever dream we are living in ends for the masses.

            Good comment.  It touches on Z-man’s point about oversaturation of higher education.  Who is going to attend these colleges and universities if the smart kids aren’t being born?   From what I see the higher education racket is banking on immigrants.  That’s one reason the country is being flooded with third world trash;  the MORE MORE rackets need human flesh to keep going.In regards to higher education, the low quality human capital they are bringing into the class room will come out four years later as low quality human capital with a degree.  If you think the Indian engineers are bad, just wait till your HR department starts hiring Angolan engineers.

            I agree. There were so many albums from the past where each song is very good, sometimes great.  Often the album was considered an art form, such as the “concept album,” like Tommy, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, The Wall, Sergeant Pepper, etc.

        One was album sales where you paid for ten songs, even though you wanted just one song.
Yeah, that was sometimes lame. However, if the album in question wasAppetite for Destructionbought on the basis ofWelcome to the Jungle, then it was a win-win!
Of course, most albums are notAppetite.

            Actually, there were a lot of great albums back in the musical peak times of the ’60s and ’70s, and they are still avidly collected by people who weren’t born until the ’80s and ’90s…and they play them on turntables…As to the new generation of vaccine and fluoride damaged kids, not sure that’s the case…

                I am one of those 80s born aficionados, and I play them on the turntable. I love albums – clarifying thatalbummeans the estimation of the sum, not the parts. The reason for the turntable is not just sound quality (to be fair, I am a decent musician as a hobbyist), but the who ritual of selecting, putting on, and focusing on nothing else, except maybe the sleeve cover.The point is, Music used to be the focus, where the auditory used to be the sole stimulus. Now, music serves as non diegetic background music to whatever else is distracting the younger, and often older, listener.This is why the album is dead: It required focus and discipline.

            The real artists wanted to take listeners on a journey with their albums – this started back in the mid-1960s but bloated out with the pre-punk “concept albums” of the 1970s. Talentless cut-outs like Vanilla Ice were the ones selling an album on the back of a single song.

            The album was a highly unusual art form born of technological accident, its flourishing a unique aspect of Peak Whiteness—now past. I often see conservatives complain about it. Record companies didn’t like it either. (That’s why conservatives complain about it. They’re suckers and shills.) The industry resisted it, thwarted it, and tried to flee from it at every opportunity. There are whole nerd museums full of the literal hundreds of instantly failed gimmick single-song formats that followed the 45. Consumers rejected every one of them, even the ones you think were popular (cassingles, e.g.)—until the 99¢ mp3 “ringtone,” which black people bought seventeen hundred trillion of.It was Apple’s improvement ofthat, gussying up that idiot market enough to fool white people, that finally killed the album. It’s a sign of IQ collapse. Napster et al. were of little significance—except in industry propaganda (and the “techno-libertarian” jack-off fantasies it inspires). Pirates are album guys. Pirates, nostalgists, and vinyl “collectors” arethe only remaining album buyers. What’s interesting is why the industry lies about it. Internally they don’t. They’re just glad it’s over. Albums made the industry anartbusiness, the music label an agency for (client of) its musicians, the producer a social superior to the executive, etc. That’s not how they want it to be. Whiteness is inefficient.

        Like real estate in California for a long time now it has mystified me how people can pay these huge prices for sports and concert tickets and the subscription fees to watch their favorite, usually black, sportsballer?Operations like Ticketmaster and its upcharges would make Al Capone blush.Never mind $250 or much more for tickets to see NFL games live to avoid the race mixing tv commercials.But it just keeps going on.Until it doesnt, i guess.

            deflation is in the answer.  Another guy i read likes to point out that the “rich” have almost all their wealth in paper value and can’t access this, but he is incorrect.  Worked at a big investment bank about a decade ago and the “rich” were taking out jumbo loans against the value of their portfolios.  Round and round we go…………………..where we stop…….deflation
The reason why people fear deflation instinctively is because when you boil it down, it means you’ve got too many people.

                “The reason why people fear deflation instinctively is because when you boil it down, it means you’ve got too many people.”
It’s much simpler than that. It’s feared because we’ve been told almost since birth to fear it. It’s hard to fight a lifetime of propaganda. And it’s doubly hard when most people who end up unafraid of deflation got there just by being contrarian, not reasoning it out from first principles.
Deflation is just a symptom of the moneyed elites losing power to steal from you. That should be a cause for joy, not trepidation.

                I sadly left coastal California because of overcrowding and non-whites, but I miss it a lot because the weather is mild summer almost all year round and you have quick access to the gorgeous ocean and mountains. Marin County or Laurel Canyon in the 1960s must have been paradise.
But one of the curses of being a human is that you usually don’t appreciate the good times as you are living through them.

                Just today I was remarking to a fellow at work that my last NFL game was in 1986.  End zone seats, a few rows up from the field in the then-Rich Stadium, were $10.  Those seats are now in excess of $200.  And when the Bills move to their new – taxpayer funded – stadium in a year or two, they will likely cost double that amount.
And still the meatheads pony up for the privilege of worshipping a tribe of entitled luggage testers.

        On the one hand, they need to make going to the theater appealing, which means massive computer-generated worlds that dazzle on the big screen. On the other hand, it means dealing with the reality that content best watched at home is easily pirated. That leaves little motivation to pay for quality writing and directing.So true.I was lamenting this to my wife the other day. It’s all amazing CGI and special effects. Doubt a movie likeThe Deer Hunterwould ever be green-lit today. What a story that told. Then again, I think the director (Cimino?) was one of those intense fellows who controlled every aspect and wanted realism.Don’t see much of that in Hollywood these days.

        Live attendance at sporting events is an interesting trend to watch.  Colleges still have a built in base of support that is willing to spend a lot of money to go to games.  Last night Duke and Kansas played in Las Vegas, reported attendance was over 14,000 and it looked like it on TV.  The Maui Invitational is currently being held in Maui, and although played in a small gym, each of the eight schools involved can get a couple thousand fans to travel over to Hawaii during Thanksgiving week to watch the games.With college football, attendance has held up at the successful power conference schools but is dropping otherwise.  There is growing pressure to break off the top 60-70 schools for football and let the rest of the NCAA sports return to some sort of normalcy.  I suspect one of the hang ups is the loss of tax exemptions for what is obviously a for profit enterprise and has been for decades.

                Well, if you qualify your statement as “athletes pretending to be students”. You’d have something.  Waay back when, about 30 years or so at my old institution someone did the numbers on our a basketball team.  Seems that 96% never graduated with a degree.  They played as long as they were eligible and then vanished!  Athletic department got all huffy and so, but they were never able to refute the numbers.  Football was little better.Never was a sports ball fan, so I couldn’t care less. Athletics dept was a wart on the ass of the university as far as this academic was concerned.

        First, I want to wish our esteemed host and everyone here a very Happy! Thanksgiving and one filled with joy and cheer.Happy Thanksgiving everyone!Secondly, its pretty clear that Live Sports presents a big issue for streamers. Anyone seeing the glitches with the Tyson Fight knows that Netflix has not solved that, though Amazon Prime with Thursday Night Football has.Live sports is the only way to get the male audience. They’ve checked out long ago from anything Network or Cable, which remains a female/gay ghetto. Example: CBS “Tracker” is absolutely repellent and of no interest to any straight male. And that is one of the less “CW” type shows. Indeed CW itself now owned by Nexstar, is moving towards live sports, they have ACC games, LIV Golf, and other stuff on and are slowly dumping their woke female/gay shows.Interestingly some of the streamers have shows oriented towards men: Stallone in Tulsa Kings, Colin Farrell in Penguin, are two examples.As I noted back in the early Obama Admin, Network TV went mostly female back in the early 1980s. Astonishingly as it seems, even through the mid to late 1980s there were shows aimed at men and thus live sports faced competition for the male audience. Though clearly the balance of shows in terms of hourly broadcasts were female oriented.[My methodology was to look at the Fall Network schedule on Wikipedia. I’d count up the hours for female and male oriented and see the balance. I chose Fall only as it represented the Networks best guess of what would work and got the most money spent on promotion and filming. Those shows I had no personal knowledge of I looked up on Wikipedia and made guesses based on actors, format (sitcoms skew female mostly — there are exceptions) and plots. I figured it plotted out nicely the feminization of the US before the internet and driven by marketing dogma that women make/determine most consumer purchase.]OT: Zerohedge has a link to Marc Andreesen being interviewed by Joe Rogan. His news was that he and other VCs had meetings with the Biden Admin last spring. They were told flat out there would be only 2, maybe 3, big firms allowed to do AI. Everyone else would be forbidden. And the AI and the firms would be government controlled and run — that the Biden people would directly control their AI research and deployment. That the Biden Admin’s view of AI was total and direct social control to everyone’s minute actions. What people could or could not buy, etc.That furthermore, at least 30 VCs and start up execs were debanked, totally. Their money seized, gone, and left without a bank. That this was the further enhancement of Operation Chokepoint — aimed at destroying gun companies and marijuana growers, and would be expanded to eventually everything that the Admin did not like.So if you wonder why Trump won, that is the answer: Obama’s desire to control everything as a Shadow Xi Xinping. Those with ambitions predictably thwarted it.Another rumor I have heard (not sure I believe it) is that the Lightbringer has a very virulent case of HIV and is dying. Hence his “I don’t care about nuclear war” moves. He does look bad, weak and frail, in a way he did not just two years ago.

            Is there such a thing as virulent HIV that overwhelms the current regime of drugs?  Magic Johnson’s still hanging in there more than 30 years after his prognosis, so I can’t imagine The Lightbringer wouldn’t be getting drugs that were even more effective.  There’s no way they’d let him die from what was called “gay cancer” at one point.

            Seconding the recommendation of the Rogan interview with Marc Andreesen. Andreesen points out how much commie garbage was already implemented and how much more commie garbage was in the cards.
I’m not sure about the Lightbringer’s health, but Slick Willie is looking absolutely terrible these days. Maybe it’s because he knows his only offspring is actually a Hubbell rather than a Clinton?

        I made the mistake of going to a Boston College football game with a relative perhaps 8 or 9 years ago in Newton, MA. There was no advertising at the game other than posters and the like. But the game was frequently halted 2 or 3 minutes at a shot for what appeared to be no reason at all. Of course it was for advertising to the television and radio audience. If you’re at home you can get up to take a wizz or whatnot. But at the stadium you pretty much have to just sit there and wait for the referee to resume the game.

            You’ve got to be a true blue fan to make the hassle of the gameday experience worth it. When football games lasted two hours it was one thing, sort of like going to the movies, but now it’s 4, not counting the drive there, parking, getting inside and back out, making it more like a 6 hour odyssey, and a whole day commitment for anybody who wants to tailgate.

            The average gameplay for an NFL game is around 11 minutes.  It’s bad enough on TV when you can distract yourself during commercials.  But sacrificing 6 hours for 11 minutes of content is torture.

        It seems like more than just a coincidence that right when growth in sportsball as a business concern is beginning to become threatened, gambling on it is becoming more legalized and much more promoted. Helping draw and keep the attention of “fans” who might otherwise not have cared so much. Which helps keep those streaming subscriptions up.The mysterious unexplainable thing about the new music industry economy is why so many fans are still willing to pay top dollar to be packed in like sardines, sitting in uncomfortable chairs, to listen to shit music. But they do. Which suggests sportsball may also continue to have some kind of future. Although one can picture, in a deflationary environment, a day when some of the multimillion dollar player contracts can no longer be paid.

I couldn’t agree more.  I would add that most music acts are using autotune and pre-recordings, so you are really just there for the choreography.  I would rather watch a no-name local band at a small venue, than watch tiny figures running around faking it to a soundtrack I can listen to at home.

        Entertainment is extremely price sensitive. When prices become unreasonable people will just run up the Jolly Roger and pirate what they want. I think I paid $4 to get the entirety of the Rugby World Cup last year.

        I think sports will devolve into a gambling racket.  Young people seem more interested in their fantasy teams or the myriad ways to bet on just about anything that happens during the game.  That may be the major source of revenue for them going forward.

        “You can’t beat technology” should be the motto of the age. Power will belong to the set of incipient elites that best adapts to this reality. So far, amazingly enough, it is the Trump/Vance/Musk triumvirate is winning the future, but they do have less baggage from the old managerial world.
Note: That does not necessarily mean “our side” is winning. Power requires sacrifices, and the DR, or whatever we’re calling it these days, will (probably) be the first on the altar.

Starting this season, they stood up an app called ‘Victory+’ on which nearly all of their regular season games can be watched for free within their respective territories (based on IP address) on cell phone, tablet, smart TV etc.. They figured out the cable model was failing, many of their fans had already cut the cord, and decided to make the leap into running their own app &amp; production. Unfortunately it reverts to TNT and Max when the playoffs come round.The ads cover the cost.. for now.Maybe they start charging in a couple of years, we’ll see. My guess is it goes pay when a lot of other teams jump on and abandon the regional sports cable channels.

        I think I read recently that 99 of the top 100 TV programs last year in terms of viewership were mostly NFL games, and a few marquee college football games.  Almost no artistic content, or whatever name we want to give it.Tomorrow we will see the continuation of the (relatively new) 3-game Thanksgiving football.  But there’s now a game on Black Friday.  Then, right back to the Sunday routine.It’s becoming 6-sigma problem.  The effort to squeeze the first couple of decimal places of profit requires little energy.  But the next 3 sigmas, so to speak, grow exponentially harder.Consumers go through the same calculation.  How much effort am I willing to make to squeeze just an ounce more entertainment out of something?  For a lot of people the answer for now seems to be “okay, one more subscription that I can cancel after the 7-day free trial is fine.”  But eventually that loophole gets closed.Millions upon millions of people are so sad and lonely that they just want to stare blankly into a screen just to feel nothing.  To go numb.just like other addictive substances, the programs latch onto the instinct to just want to go blank.A much smaller percentage recognizes the futility of it all, and just embraces a numb-free world.  Lots of other hobbies out there, and tv is not worth the time or effort.  VPNs?  Eh.  Sounds like work.  Not worth it.  Think I’ll go for a hike, maybe cook something cool and save myself $50 by not paying for something that exists only for people trying to fill that aching void.

        don’t know how much general interest there is in vinyl, here, but i recently purchased a ‘near mint’ copy of the Manassas double album.  It originally sold for $9 in 1972; the equivalent price today would be $57.  I paid about $50 including shipping.  sounds gorgeous in a way digital just can’t match.what is peculiar to me, is that many people today are buying vinyl that was based on a digital source?!  not sure what you are actually hearing at that point.here’s the thing, a shiton of master tapes (that any vinyl reprint should be using) were lost in a massive warehouse fire in 2008.  so for those albums you really can’t get a pure analog new pressing.  info here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Universal_Studios_fire#:~:text=A%202019%20expos%C3%A9%20from%20The,Universal%20Music%20Group%20(UMG).the musical equivalent of the library at Alexandria burning down.

            Vinyl records suck.  They are delicate, prone to damage, cumbersome and non-user friendly.   All the folks raving about the fidelity are just imagining things.***  Just like high end bourbon consumers.  Sorry fellas, its all the same stuff.I have 4000 songs on my Ipod and I can carry it in my pocket and pick out any number of them by twirling my finger.You can’t even make it through an entire LP with out having to trundle over to the blasted record player and flip the disc.  No sale.  OK, there are some folks who like the old cumbersome stuff.  Some people still shoot flintlocks.  But don’t try to put a shine on the flintlock being a better weapon than an AR.***  I admit, I have no ear for fidelity.  It’s a blessing.  The quality of the recording should be a minor concern compared to the quality of the song writing, the skill of the musicians and the beauty of the melody.  I’d rather focus on those qualities than how much compression I can perceive.

                Fairly put, but for me mp3 stuff doesn’t cut it, so I rip CD’s.  If you want to get a good idea of such—for me at least—tune into your Sirius Radio.  They compress the hell out of their downloaded stuff.  Very noticeable when you switch to any local fm channel while driving through the city.

                It may not be that your ear sucks but that you haven’t dropped high 4 figures to low 5 figures for a system. If your amp isn’t tubes, and you don’t test/replace them constantly, you  might as well go with transistors, at which point there’s little difference between that and digital.
If you rip your own 256 or 320 mp3s, like@Compsciis evidently doing, that’s going to be really hard to beat. Extract to FLAC, and probably no audiophile with less than mid-5 figure setup can tell the difference.

        There’s another factor that’s ready to pop the sports bubble: Gen-z has absolutely no interest in sports. Sports consumption is almost entirely driven by boomers and Gen-x to an extent. Millennials are interested mostly for reasons of fantasy football, but other than that there’s a huge dropoff. As boomers die off, you’ll see enormous drops in viewership.

        Great essay. Only thing I think was left out is the rise of legal sports gambling, and how that industry (just like the pharmaceutical industry and legacy news media) is in many ways heavily subsidizing the entire sports industry even as traditional revenue streams are starting to decline. I haven’t checked in a while, but I understand the lifetime value of a customer for Draft Kings or Fan Duel is so extreme, that they are both willing to pay an abnormally high amount for advertising and customer acquisition, and not really bothered by low overall ratings of casual fans.

        Fortunately jazz, Z’s favorite genre, has only benefitted from tech.
You no longer have to live in an urban area to hear it and since the 90s there has been a steady flow of out-of-print albums being released as CDs and Mp3s.

        One thing about Prime though – they toss in the channel for free with the Amazon subscription which usually pays for itself with the free shipping.  So not as bad a deal as others.
The content is not that great, but there are a few things that are interesting – the behind the scenes sports documentaries are pretty good (“All or Nothing” I think they are called).

            Amazon shipping is subsidized by the taxpayers in the form of below cost USPS deliveries.  It’s a win-win-lose.  Amazon gets a monopoly in online selling because it’s too good of a deal to pass up and USPS gets to keep it’s bloated employee base.  The only losers are the taxpayers funding this shell game.  But yes, I am a subscriber.  It’s too big to beat, and I figure I am already paying for it with my taxes.

            Amazon is the ideal business. Its product is the destruction of other businesses. It’s wholly above traditional economic incentives and motivations, yet it’s run by insane chiselers, ruthless maximizers of workplace dystopian-ness, with a management philosophy inspired by theSawmovies. Given an unbreakable monopoly in mail-order junk, it’sstillunwaveringly devoted to ripping you off with fake products and reviews, “AI”-enforced packing practices so incompetent they seem optimized to break your shit (which they’ll gladly send again, broken again, until the whole stock is smashed), etc.And—The submerged 90+% of the Amazon iceberg is “black” surveillance and censorship apparatus of unknown scope and provenance.If I watched TV, that’s whose channel I’d tune in to. It’s the monster from the libertarian id.

        At least with American sports, you generally only need one subscription to watch, say, the NFL.  If you are a soccer fan (especially European/SA), each league seems to be on a separate platform.  And then the international tournaments are on yet another platform.
Sucks.

                Yeah they’ve really started pushing soccer here… it’s OK to me to play it, but watching it on TV is incredibly boring.
Rugby OTOH, not so bad. Much more watchable than NFL, and matches finish in much less time since that clock keeps running.

                    Anybody who tries to tell you soccer isn’t boring is a stone liar. Nobody thinks it’s exciting. Nobody. Not even the Euro hooligans, who had to come up with songs to sing during the games to keep themselves entertained. But they are loyal to it in spite of the boredom, because it’s their culture, and they feel that certain something inside when their team (finally) scores against the enemy team from wherever. Kind of like how the Ohio State fan endures the irritation of the endless commercials and stoppages in play for that feeling he gets when they score the winning touchdown against Michigan.

        Speaking for myself, there have been very few films that I’ve deemed worth watching in the last few years — Dune 1 and 2, Blade Runner 2049, Parasite, Snow Piercer. The first two were directed by a Canadian and the last two by a South Korean. There seems to be a dearth of good ideas and/or the courage to invest in them.

            Agreed, but in fairness the low hanging fruit has been picked.  I was a TV watcher as a child in the 50’s and beyond.  We didn’t know it was slow poison then.  Now in old age, I’m quite bored with it all as new ideas are becoming rare and most shows/movies are reboots or remakes of old plot lines.  I note as examples of how bad it is the movies you mention—they are complete exceptions to the above and pop up perhaps a few time in a year.  Hollywood knocks out between 500-700 movies a year however.  You can compute the odds for yourself.   😉

                You can never go wrong with a good steak. Grilled a jerk paste-encrusted NY strip over pecan last night, topped it with a sauce of lime, cilantro and sour cream, and accompanied by corn fritters and a bottle of Sicilian red. Mos’ satisfyin’.

            I just do a bone-in turkey breast, roasted over lemon slices and coated with herb butter. Generally makes a square meal with southern cornbread dressing and the rest of the trimmins.
And toward that end, happy Thanksgiving to Z and all the Zsters. Thanks to Trump, Musk and a few others we can at least be thankful to have been spared four years of Kamaltoe and Minnesota Spats.

        As the cost to produce and distribute digital media started dropping in the 90s due to the internet the amount of media produced grows exponentially because everyone can do it. Now there is so much media being produced there isn’t enough time to even watch it let alone find it, even with recommendation algorithms. This has led to the exponential growth of online ads as well because the ease of content production is connected to the ease of selling ads to monetize it. Clearly media is in a bubble that will have to burst at some point otherwise all media eventually ends up being 100% ads.

        Nowadays, my only contact with sporting events occurs on NFL Sunday, if and only if the Buffalo Bills play at 1 or 4 in the afternoon. I get three hours of chores done while drinking beer and listening to the ballgame on the radio. TV? Never. If they play in another slot, I’ll catch the highlights on Youtube the next day, if I think of it.

        Technology kills that which it loves. It’s like the scorpion crossing the river on the back of the frog and promising not to sting. But of course technology is going to sting. The biggest stinger of all is on the scorpion we call AI. If Skynet ever arises, we can thank our greed and laziness for making it possible, on the river we call our lives.

        The one good thing about the modern age is that with websites around, you can follow your favorite band and see when they’re going to be performing near you. The internet has made a whole raft of things possible, mostly good. I don’t see many people hating Amazon Dot Com or Reddit — some things *have* gotten better. The internet will undergo rapid evolution in the centuries to come, its architecture adapted for the holographic and VR worlds. And with every new step into a new frontier, there will be billions to be made by the quick and clever. Long live the internet!— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
