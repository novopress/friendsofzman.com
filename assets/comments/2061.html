        Dan Snyder should offer to move his team to Los Angeles and rename it the Los Angeles Stars.  It’s an offer that could not be refused.  Los Angeles desperately wants its own team and the NFL desperately wants to put this issue of the Redskins name behind it. The city and the league are so desperate, I suspect they might be willing to build Snyder a stadium for free.  The Stars could replace the St. Louis Rams in the NFC West and the Rams could move to the NFC East, which is a pretty decent alignment. Plus, there’s the delicious spite factor:  Snyder would not only end up richer from being in the biggest media market in the country, but he’d have made the league pay for its abject cowardice.

        It’s time to change that offensive name.  I would suggest “Washington Dirty Politicans”.  Or perhaps “Washington Crooked Senators”.  Or maybe “Washington Tax and Spenders”.   How about “Washington Red Ink”?

        Never!  Always fire from the hip. The pondered anger has no spark.

        Also “ashamed of,” not “ashamed at.” Otherwise, I agree with the content. No need to post my comments.

        Z, your screeds could have been written by my more-inclined self. The rule of law has indeed been thoroughly cheated and in short order. The hippies clearly expect the general populace to follow suit directly. It will be fun to watch them get theirs…
