        I’m not sure if this got attention or not, but I thought it was awesome how the people behind Trump, on the stage, did not panic nor stampede. And when Trump was being moved out, and he gave the raised fist, they all started cheering. Nodobody knew how many people had been shot, or died. But they stood their ground and probably avoided many more injuries and deaths.
That was almost as impressive as Trump’s response.

            It is the most important aspect. Likewise, and this is hard to see this close in time, those people are not afraid to be there in the first place, State-sponsored assassination attempt aside. The people there know full well this evil Regime may put them in the crosshairs as well.

            That’s a relevant observation, that the crowd didn’t panic. A panicked mob may even cause more deaths than some real or imagined threat, as recent experience with pilgrims at Mecca, not-so-recent attendees at a Who concert, or any number of other unfortunate incidents could attest.

            But by then, many in the crowd already knew it was a setup that had barely failed…Crowd members saw the shooter climbing up to the roof with a rifle, and pointed that out to the Secret Service..ignored completely, which means the SS was in on it…Police snipers saw the shooter setting up, and were ordered not to shoot..Even after he started firing, ordered not to shoot..Finally, one of them, Jonathan Willis, killed the shooter anyway, and was promptly arrested, and subsequently fired…All this was posted on Telegram by Jonathan Willis…Trump was saved when he moved his head a millisecond before the bullet passed, causing only a grazing wound..Meanwhile, his female SS minder tried to hide under his body rather than protect him….

                        Just because it might be, doesn’t mean it is. Nor does the situation painted require some immediate and drastic action on one’s part. Action upon misinformation is often a tactic of one’s opponent. Certainly action under misunderstanding of the situation bodes ill for success.
Think, evaluate, use your good senses.  There is lots of FUD circulating by folks who profit from such.

The Telegram account was reported first on Gateway Pundit, not exactly an obscure little amateur.
You know, the same SS that interfered like mad, breaking the evidence chain with JFK’s remains?
We’ve been “well, let’s not get carried away…” ever since. Bah, humbug!

                                You are supporting the post by Pyrrhus who said the police told the their sniper not to shoot the assassin?  Not heard of that, but if so what does that mean?  That the FBI knew of the assassin’s intent and allowed it to proceed, or that the FBI, or whoever, was not sure of who the person on the rooftop was—bad guy or good guy at the time?  Then the shooting began and the bad guy was taken out.There are other assertions as well made.  To assume all those assertions are true and to make the worse of them is totally premature until investigation completes.You are jumping the gun.  The situation is now stable and we await further inquiry.

                It makes sense that the local police sniper was ordered not to fire first by the SS, as they might be worried that if they did start firing the SS might shoot the sniper while in an hysterical tizzy.

                    You would think the SS would (and definitely should) know where the local police snipers were stationed and therefore would not fire upon them.  That is simply basic coordination.  At the very least, the SS was grossly negligent in its pre-event preparation and coordination.

            Marko:  Excellent point.  Because that crowd was WHITE, included lots of MEN, and lots of folks who grew up before social media turned all of society into a middle-school ‘mean girl’ cat fight.  That area of Pennsylvania is composed of primarily heritage Americans and working class people.  People accustomed to figuring out how things work and then keeping them working.  The backbone of the teetering system of “White privilege” which includes hard work and being on time.
﻿Trump’sresponse makes me think he might be worthy of them, after all.

        Liberals at the top are calling for “unity”, and Trump pointed out in an interview with the NY Post this weekend that this is difficult because the differences are ideological and policy-based. If you support men in dresses rubbing up on children at your local library, and I don’t, what is the unifying position? Of course there isn’t one. One person will win and one person will lose, and the winner will impose his position on the loser by force. For decades, the left has been the winner. They believe that they are on the “right side of history”, which is a liberal/progressive frame in and of itself. So their vision of unity is, really, everyone becoming a liberal. Which of course isn’t going to happen which means they aren’t going to change. Indeed, it has not – hop on Reddit or shitlib X and you will see that, outside of the “too bad he missed” stuff you’d expect, they are whining about gun control and claiming that the problem really is the right because the shooter was a Republican (they say this in a world where the Lincoln Project exists, and Dems organized for people to register/vote against Trump in the primary no matter their party affiliation less than six months ago).There are no brakes on this train.

            The media’s most impressive ability is to make peoplestop knowingsomething. People who themselves participated in strategic primary party switching truly don’t believe that anyone has ever done that.There were no covid lockdowns, no vaccine mandates, no staged plague street theater from China, etc. That’s all nazi propaganda. Ask any Democrat. Ask Sailer (but I repeat myself).The other gunman in the news this week was Alec Baldwin.He’s not famous for acting. That was a long time ago. Until he killed that woman, he was best known for leaked voicemails of him screaming insanely and threatening violence against his teenage daughter. Tabloid stories of him abusing every woman he knows go back to the ’80s.He’s an absolute psycho, consumed by parody-level misogynistic rage, the kind in tv shows for girls.Finallyhe got mad enough to shoot a bitch—fully intentionally. He aimed and fired, seeking at least a symbolic murder, to send her a message with a gun. Any other explanation is implausible. We know who he is. But who remembers? No one. Not one of /our/ lawyer-podcasters has played the voicemails.No onehas said, “Of course he shot her and meant it. He’s fucking insane! We all know!” Because we don’t know—anymore.It’s an amazing phenomenon.

                This is an excellent observation and your conclusion is irrefutable. For me, it is almost terrifying. I have some family legal issues with a very elderly relative. I have been texting two of my siblings over the past two years about one particular aspect of it (I am handling it) asking for their cooperation and participation with me in handling it as a team. For two years, they did nothing but argue with me (over text messages) about how I was insane, that it wasn’t needed, I was overreacting, etc. (Oh, and these are both females.)Two weeks ago a lawyer was needed and we didn’t have one. I texted my sisters to inform them that this was why. They both denied that I ever raised the issue once with them. Haughtily as well, as if I were — again — “crazy.”I promptly printed all of our texts (I kept them all) into PDF format and sent it as an attachment so they could read their own words over the years. I said: “You will be angry that I am sending you this. But your untruthfulness and/or lack of memory is why I had to keep a record.” I have not heard from either one of them since.

                People remember, even if they remember it vaguely as a ghost that haunts them. Or they just stay mum because they would like to forget. And damn, they almost have a point, because everything that has happened to the country is malicious and was done on purpose. That’s hard to accept.
All of these things you mentioned are like elephants in the room for the whole country. It’s causing everyone, young and old, anxiety to different degrees.

                As to Alec Baldwin, the woman he shot was making a documentary on child trafficking in Ukraine.
(I say they knew his proclivities and set him up as a patsy with live ammo “accidentally” finding its way onto the set “to save a few pennies.” He may  have thought he was firing blanks.)

                    There we go again with illogical conspiracy theory based upon a set of supposed facts with less probability as the easier explanation—gross negligence. So someone sets up AB with live ammo to kill women. 1) they assume he doesn’t check the weapon, 2) He fires the weapon (it is not defective as he claims) 3) He is so accurate as to shoot the poor lady in the head rather that miss. 4) The women hit, dies rather than lives (bullets always kill?)Just the way I’d plan a plot to get rid of a pesky documentary film producer. No way that’s gonna fail, right?  And much more creative than a car accident.

                Did he vote in the primary? If so, does that mean he switched? Was he a registered Democrat before— 2 years ago, when he turned 18? Honest questions. When I think of 20 year olds, I don’t think consumed by politics, but I could be old.
The only thing that sticks out to me that I’ve read is that people say he got bullied in school. For all anybody knows, he wasn’t even politically motivated.

            Yes, their idea of “unity” is much like their notion of “having a dialogue on race.” In the case of the latter what the really mean is that Leftists get to lecture and hector a captive white audience and in the end browbeat them into joining their anti-white crusade. Unity, indeed–the unity of the slave barracoon.

            I read that Trump is scrapping a pre-planned speech and having it rewritten to emphasize national unity.That obviously won’t appease the lunatic Left, but it makes sense if he’s trying to appeal to normie and conservacuck pundits, who still naively believe that democracy is real.
Hopefully he understands that it’s not the Reagan era anymore.  National unity is impossible in modern multicultural Woke America.  Deep State power &amp; raw tribalism trump the marketplace of ideas.

                Need to hear the rewrite, but it’s a good move.  The Lefties will never join Trump, but the “Conservative” never Trumpers may move toward him a bit if they feel he’s less of a reincarnation of Hitler.

            Not going to be easy, but they have become so extreme with the men in dresses and transing kids etc. that not very many people support that madness. Especially if they have kids.

                Possible.  One of the things one encounters with those traumatically shot is they are often “dead, but don’t know it”. Lots of damage can be done in the few minutes they have to bleed out but feel no pain.  This is one reason cops keep shooting the suspect until basically they run out of ammo.  “Anyone worth shooting once is worth shooting twice”, is a crude but somewhat accurate phrasing in the milieu.

        I see MSNBC pulled Morning Joe from its lineup today.  The point of the show the last eight years has been to work liberals into lather about Trump.  I don’t think either host is capable of self restraint, so it will be interesting to see if and when they bring it back.  Few media lefties have been able to completely restrain themselves, David Frum wrote something that should get him deported back to Canada.  Also worth watching is what happens to the Secret Service and if Trump keeps using them the rest of the campaign.  The women serving in his detail should have been standing outside Jimmy Carter’s house.  Another institution that is most likely past the point of reform.

            Someone on Twitter made the point that the Navy has a sub filled with misfit sailors. The sub never does anything useful. Years ago it was revealed that NYCV has a “rubber room” for misfit teachers. Instead of firing them, they put the teachers in this building where they do nothing all day, but get paid. I once knew a woman who worked at the IRS. She was near retirement, so they put her at a desk where she spent her time with the others close to retirement, doing nothing.My sense is the SS handles their dead weight the same way. Trump gets the screwups.

                Economists are mystified over the low productivity of the US economy over the last thirty or so years despite the tech advances. I think this exactly explains it in a nutshell. It can’t overcome the deadweight/diversity which burdens the entire economy top to bottom.

                        They equate productivity with job loss. We ship our production off shore. We have more goods, but less (American) labor involved. But I’ll let Citizen provide the final answer here.

                I listened to a X Spaces this weekend where someone with experience on this said that they have major turnover problems, SS isn’t a very good job (boring work, lots of travel, etc.), and anybody even remotely competent transfers to the FBI as soon as possible. Of course this is not something that the feds want you to know about, but more proof of the competency crisis.

                Did a project for a utility company that put all it’s misfits they couldn’t fire because of union rules into a room.  Everyone called it “The Departure Lounge”.
Some of them played games, read books, twiddled their thumbs.  Some actually came up with ideas for the company and made themselves useful.

                Japanese businesses were known for a similar practice, where some were shunted off to a room to do nothing all day.In that New York case and other districts, look closer at the Teacher’s Union that makes it far harder to get rid of incompetent or harmful teachers. In addition to the rubber room, they also practice the Dance of the Lemons. The classic example is of a principal who should’ve been fired but was reassigned to another school to continue the mis- and mal-education. Now you can appreciate yet another reason why they resist the vouchers, and rail at home schooling.

                    “Japanese businesses were known for a similar practice, where some were shunted off to a room to do nothing all day.”
I forget the term, but 1980s bubble-era Japan had a backroom slur for these types which referred to a woman’s urine tract when she was menstruating (as in something is only half-useful and even that much is discarded). Supposedly it came from the yakuza, which…even for gutter terminology is pretty raunchy.

                The easiest way to deal with a troublemaker is to transfer him, her, or xer to another department. I’ve experienced this first-hand in the military 😎 This is even a background theme in popular culture. Does anyone remember the scene inDances with Wolveswhere Lt. Dunbar arrives at the frontier output and meets the commandant who’s wearing a dress?Slightly more seriously: Bad image from any angle for the Secret Service here, no doubt. Overlooking, reportedly, a 20-foot ladder, a figure with a rifle atop a nearby building and one reported to police well before the event, seems a major lapse of vigilance. To stoke the conspiracy fires, of course what more plausibly deniable way to increase the risk of a mishap by placing incompetent staff with Trump? To their credit, at least the good guys (?) killed the sniper quickly. “Of course, that was all part of the planned operation,” said some guy wearing a tinfoil hat in the corner.

                    The older brother worked as a prison doctor.  The new warden was a radicalized female, who had been shuffled out of three other managerial positions in other departments.  She had all kinds of great ideas and new programs to try.
Of course my older bro didn’t last much beyond the probationary period, neither did 90% of the staff.  The cross-lateral turnover even in state agencies is just insane.

                    To me the ladder is even more mysterious than all the other supposed coincidences. Are we supposed to believe the kid himself brought the ladder? That would mean he managed to get it into position without anyone saying anything. Of course there have been a few legitimate investigative journalists who have worn a safety vest and brought a ladder or some power tools to a supposedly secure location and just walked right past security without being challenged. Is that possibly what happened here?If I were in charge of looking into this, I would prioritize analyzing photos from the site that show the location of the ladder to get an idea of when the ladder first appeared and who moved it into position.

                            That actually sounds less plausible than the kid bringing the ladder. Then again with so many xirlcops in law enforcement these days perhaps they just decided that their makeup would run in the heat if they went up there.

            What we saw in real time is how adding dead-weight isn’t just useless, but dangerous. Watching those three women messing with their glasses, being unable to put their gun back in the holster, and getting in the way of men who knew what they were doing showed that.
Add enough clowns, and you’re going to drastically reduce the capability of the competent members. I’m still on “Team Incompetence” as opposed to “Team Malice” on this, but an unsecured roof that close to Trump makes me wonder if there wasn’t someone on the inside giving a tip.

                Certainly the incompetence is a factor with the Secret Service. The question that will never be answered is if they assigned him bad agents intentionally, hoping they would get Trump killed.  Obviously the diversity push brings down quality overall.  The biggest question is what caused the shooter to act.  He is really young to feel this hopeless and radicalized.  I don’t think we will ever have good answers on that question.

                    Introduce yourself to the next generation. 20 year olds have gone through Covid, the insanity of education in the 2010s, and phones pushed in their faces from age 6 or 7 onward.We are older and think of “20” the way we experienced being 20. That was a different world. It is gone. These children were used as lab rats in dozens of ways.We are in serious trouble because many of them are like this. They will be useless for the entirety of their lives, absorbing the energies of the rest of us, destroying what we create, sapping our will to remain in this arrangement further.The fact is that we are going to pay a terrible price for most of what occurred from the 1960s onward. We have very few serious men remaining (spoudaios).We did not raise them, so we will not find them. I do not believe it is possible to stop what is coming now. Like nature, it will do what it wants with us.

Correct. And if the true answer is in the affirmative, then what we witnessed was a combination of incompetence and malice.

                    Since he was 12 years old he’s been told Trump is Hitler. Then the Covid lockdowns probably really drilled it into his head 24/7 and no real world experience as he couldn’t go outside for years. And his father is therapist supposedly and if that’s true he probably put him on psych drugs. Maybe even some hormones. So, when it started looking like Trump was going to win, he wanted to stop Hitler.
What else is there to understand?

That he could have possessed, on God’s Greenacre, any reasonable expectation he could succeed in finding an unpoliced perch from which to get off even a single shot. He may have operated under the influence of drugs or delusions of grandeur but it’s complicated and not fully disclosed HTF he found a ladder and scampered over a hot tin roof to position his weapon and nearly kill the President through iron sights from 1.5 football fields away under stress. It’s curious, to say the least.

                        Nowadays if someone is attracted to the idea of being a therapist, there’s a very high probability that they themselves are mentally ill and in need of help. Say what you want about Freud and the other early psychotherapists. They may have been unscientific quacks but they were at least intelligent men making a sincere effort at finding out how the mind works.Today’s therapist is generally an uncurious and neurotic xirl with a bachelor’s in “studies” and then a master’s in therapy when she gets tired of working at Starbucks. Even the few males left in the field are generally severely cucked soyfags.

                If they’re that incompetent they could easily be bribed or cajoled into giving away info. But I think the shooter was more likely groomed by a faction with plausible deniability. Someone deliberately deployed forces away from the building so as to give him a shot. Gotta be an inside job.

                Now expand that out to the military.  Just imagine how bad it is there.   If we go to war with Russia, China and probably Iran, we lose.

                I have no training or expertise in executive protection but I saw the arial photo of the rally site. If someone told me that you could only secure one part of the grounds outside of the main stage area it would have been the roof of the building where the shooter was. i can’t see any way that the SS made a “mistake”.

                    They let the local LE take those positions but they allegedly told them they couldn’t fire first and probably told them if they see something to ask them first before they can take out an assassin. The police snipers were probably terrified the nervous nellies of the SS would shoot them if they shot first.

                “…an unsecured roof that close to Trump makes me wonder if there wasn’t someone on the inside giving a tip.”There’s simply no other explanation. Certainly there is incompetence in every government agency, but what is the sheer probability that some random, 20-year old KID, who is by all accounts a loser and a dweeb and not a marksman, would find the ONLY place where he was able to shoot Trump.. and it JUST SO HAPPENED that it wasn’t secure?The explanation is not “Aw, shit, Fred, we sure fucked that one up” as if they backed a bulldozer into a dump truck on a unionized construction site while looking at porn on their cell phones.I want to know who this kid was talking to on the Internet. I’ll bet the farm it was FBI agents… just like the Gretchen Whitmer “kidnap” hoax.Unfortunately it’s probably the case that the very same people who told him where the ladder and the unsecured roof was are the ones doing the “investigation”…

            Those women may be the first place you ought to look. From the new first female Secretary of Secret Service: “During aCBS Newsinterview in May 2023, Cheatle stated the Secret Service, which had a 48% departure rate, needed to “attract diverse candidates and give opportunities to everybody in the workforce, particularly women.” She said she aims to have 30% women in the agency by 2030.[12]”That 48% departure rate isn’t a failure. It is stage one of success. Get rid of white men and install women, then illegal alien invaders trannies and POCs. Then, when you have completed that phase, go kinetic against Heritage America.This is the plan. I hope the punditry is ready to stop with the language of uniting the entire country and starts with the language of, ‘Hey! This is racial Bolshevism. It is time for White people to organize and forge their country.’The hour is late. They have all of their moves laid out and are executing them. There will be more assassination attempts. Probably not just on Trump.

                        Who was that that left Bartleby?If the EL&amp;E section didn’t reveal another Every Single Time, you can be sure that somewhere lurks the ADL.This thing is highly organized. They can if they want choose nincompoops to execute at the head level. But, how hard is it to take orders that say, ‘These are some things that will “nudge” these white men to leave the service. Diversity is our strength. What is your plan to hire more women and POCs? Okay good. Look, we have an extensive support system for you that is ready made.We can get you more POCs once we amnesty more Migrants. Now, recruiting pipeline is something we have taken care of for you. Sarah, Rebeccah, Elliot and Elijah have an extensive list of preferred candidates out of the Universities the new DHS “Jobs For New Americans”, list and other extensive sources of talent.Now. You focus on recruiting. We’ve  got Charles Q Brown, David Goldfein along with Cory Booker and Hakim Jeffries overseeing a task force dealing with the Sec Ops side of the SS. They have the deep expertise and political power to manage this aspect of the force. We are going to merge the FBI’s agent training program with the SS and we are also going to bring in an international Sec Ops advisory led by Avi Shelot, head of Israel’s State Security Task Force and Strategic Global Advisory Service.”Then Cheatle just goes on autopilot. She doesn’t need to be competent. They assemble the team of deeply embedded conspirators around her. I just took a stab at how this might work. It wouldn’t shock me if this is exactly how it works.We are dealing with a highly scripted and highly planned Color Revolution and ongoing Controlled Demolition. Let’s hope this is a wake-up call for Trump and the entirety of patriotic Americans.To take words from Peter Theil, “They have a lot of surface area to cover.” The job of Heritage America is to give them even more surface area to cover. They are taking out the entirety of the Western World. I think Canada and Britain are finished, though Britain can still rally. The fate of our people rests in the hands of French, German, Irish, Italian and American patriots.In America it rests in how serious and how much will Trump and his team have to begin mass deportation. They have the power of the purse to take the money away. White Papers has many good peaceful humane approaches. Immigration and mass deportation, is the queen on the chess board. We must do everything in our power to support Trump. As some OGC guys mentioned the other day, Fukuyama lost. History just started again.

        I have often said that most of what our side does is vent to relieve pressure.  Nothing matters until the shooting starts.  There is no reforming the system or saving America.  Discourse is all a pointless exercise.  You are dealing with deranged, unhinged, purely rotten people that we call the left.  However much you think you hate these people it is not enough.  Anything less than the permanent removal of these scum bags from society isn’t worth a single breath.  They hate you and want you dead and they will do whatever it takes to accomplish that.  Maybe now Normie G. Civnat will realize this.  Maybe….

        I really hate saying this, but I’m actually a little numb to all this at this point.  They’ve tried to bankrupt him through the courts.  They’ve imprisoned his friends and associates and gone after his family.  And in just these last few months, they’ve attempted to imprisonhimin hopes that some Riker’s Island inmate would be allowed to get close enough to shank him.  Having some left-wing loon taking a shot at him just seems like business as usual at this point.As an aside, I work near a Biden campaign outpost and had to walk through a police perimeter in order to get into the office this morning.  It looks like the one of the responses of the Left to this weekend’s events is something along the lines of:  “Those crazy MAGA types are going to blame us for this, so we have to increase security forourselves!”  Trump, I’m sure, was and still is being allocated the diversity hires and being left essentially to his own devices.

                    I hear ya’, bud. But the Power Structure has, by every waking moment, been attempting to destroy and expel Trump from the moment he was elected. I don’t see how anybody who’s alive to that fact could think they would scruple at trying to kill the man. I pretty much felt an assassination attempt was just a matter of time. And I’m very pleased it failed.

        Trump’s luck is astounding. All the shooter had to do was aim for his chest &amp; that would’ve been it for him. I’m utterly puzzled why he doesn’t have private security, he of all people could afford to hire a private military company to protect him &amp; they would do a far better job than the secret service which is now evidently diverse.Those SS women around him aren’t anywhere near as tall as Trump, you’d think they at least hire amazon women who could actually properly shield the guy. Those two women hovering around his vehicle looked like deer in headlights, the one couldn’t even holster her gun.Also why in the hell was there not guys on those rooftops, they could’ve at least bought some cheap drones at walmart to fly around to be eyes in the sky. Trump would be better off letting his own civilian supporters protect him, there’s no shortage of people who are both armed to teeth, competent with firearms &amp; unflinchingly willing to die for the guy purely out of a sense of loyalty. A random group of MAGA supporters would’ve done afar ﻿better job of securing the area than the SS did &amp; that sounds hyperbolic on the face of it but in reality it’s not. Trump basically saved himself since it took at least two shots &amp; Trump dropping to the ground for the secret service to finally react, that’s not exactly a high bar to beat, some gangbangers randomly plucked off the street would probably have faster reaction times.That was an utterly pathetic display across the board, I have no doubt that there was genuine malice at play but given what I saw plain old incompetence borne from DIE policies was also influential in what happened too. If Trump wants to live to see this upcoming election he better minimize or, if possible, outright remove both those elements from his security detail.

                    My level iv are ceramic. They are lighter in weight than steel and certified against rounds of the caliber employed by the shooter across multiple hits.My plate carrier wouldn’t have helped Trump against a torso shot though given the angle involved. It would have missed the plates and, as you point out out, the thinner side armor is ineffective against high velocity rifle rounds.I am convinced Trump was saved by Divine Intervention and the attack and clusterfucks were real and possibly deliberate. A dude with a distinct AR pattern rifle could not have made it up onto that roof unless there was at least willful blindness.

                        Yes, should have mentioned ceramic, however was thinking thickness of plate rather than composition.  You’d notice a plate easily on Trump if he wore one.  Side shot is the key here.  He really had no protection from the angle of attack as you’ve astutely noted.

                I’m probably over analyzing &amp; I didn’t make it clear in my post but I was wondering why he didn’t go for his upper chest, worst case scenario he hits armor &amp; even that still has a chance of splattering right into his face if it’s hard armor. If it’s soft ceramic armor then at the minimum there’s going to be severe blunt trauma to the upper chest.
I’m just thinking if I really wanted to be absolutely sure but then again I wouldn’t use an AR to do it. In hindsight I’m going way too autistic on this lol.

                    I’m not that sure.  I can hit a 5 inch plate bench rest at 3–400 yard pretty steady.  Prone, without a rest, not so much.  Easy to move around with only arm support and breath control is essential.  Scared shitless because you know you’ll be dead in 60 seconds?  Yeah, it’s easy….not.  Actually, if I’d have taken the shot, I’d lock into a sitting position and be my own bench rest.  I think this guy was just plain lucky on his first shot.  Note, no SS personnel were hit and that was a pretty big cluster around Trump, but I’ve not reviewed the timing and action of the events.

            Well, the shooter could have been shooting for the center of mass. A foot or so high, is not improbably for a less than proficient “marksmen” especially if only using iron sights.  Body armor from the side won’t help with steel core 5.56 ammo, readily available.

                Trump was lucky.  We’ll never know if the guy pulled the shot and missed by 2 inches or 8.  Crazy how close security let him get. If he had brought a .30 cal hunting rifle with a scope, Trump would be dead.

                That’s true, I’m projecting a lot of details of how I would’ve handled it.A lot of plate carriers have slots on the side for plates &amp; those soft ceramic armors are armored all the way around even the sides. Still that doesn’t cover the arm/shoulder, the steel core of a green tip round could definitely pass through to the chest cavity if it didn’t hit bone. A 308 black tip &amp; probably just a regular fmj would make it but thankfully the shooter didn’t employ any of these strategies.Kind of surprised he didn’t actually now that I think about it, I assume he had to have been pretty well versed in this stuff given the gun youtuber shirt he was wearing frequently uses AP rounds in his videos.

                    Yeah, but the kid was 20 yo.  He had to “steal” the rifle from dad. (If reports are to be believed).  His proficiency might be amateurish.  Many ranges available are *not* longer than 100 yards or so.  Intermediate distances and prone shooting not available, etc.

                            I remember a few year ago, when Antifa was wreaking havoc, people were saying that they were no longer just LARPing college kids.  They were getting actual training in terror tactics, maybe even at “summer camp”-style sessions.  Meaning, they couldn’t be airily dismissed as hapless fools who were no threat.  Even their street battles back then showed signs of organization: piles of bricks deposited ahead of time, bicycles stashed nearby for quick getaway to elude vehicle pursuit.  Maybe this little crapweasel had some training before the big event.

                                They clearly had help from authorities – cops ordered to look the other way (remember that empty cop car placed in the middle of the street in CA that got petrol bombed by antifa during a protest? How did that get there?), or even act as agent provocateurs (masked guy who broke the first shop window to escalate Minneapolis riots turned out to be a cop).Antifa seem to have handlers in the police or intelligence agencies, maybe DNC/Clintons? 2020 color revolution was way too coordinated. So whoever the shooter was (Crook? Yearick?) he was likely a product of that pipeline.

                        “His proficiency might be amateurish”I think we can safely say everything he did was amateurish in regards to the shooting itself. If he really wanted to be absolutely 110% sure there was a litany of things he could’ve did to exponentially increase his odds of success.He could’ve spent a lot of money to get top tier equipment to make that shot ridiculously easy at that distance, which was very very close, so long as he could hold still long enough to let the gear do the heavy lifting. He wouldn’t even need to sight in at anything past 25 yards so long as he zeroed the optic in line with the bullet trajectory or just sighted at 25 as is &amp; did the math before taking the shot.With a name brand gun that takes a modern long range shooting cartridge, a high power scope, a tripod &amp; match grade ammo he could zero at 25 yards &amp; have enough leeway to ensure a headshot even if the zero was off by a few inches in any direction at the distance he shot. He could’ve even brought a range finder to remove any doubt as what the distance to the target was, he certainly would’ve had enough time to use one before taking the shot thanks to Trump’s piss poor excuse for security.164 yards isclose, ﻿if it was someone who wasn’t so utterly incompetent Trump would be dead. For a sniper shot against a former president this was like peak advantageous conditions, they practically rolled out the red carpet for the guy to kill Trump &amp; he still fucked it up.

                            Yes, but how much advance planning would your scenario require?  With a very good weapon, and if he practised assiduously for 6 months, I’m sure the end result would have been better. It’s just my own theory, but I don’t think this attack was planned very far in advance.  He might have been fantasizing about it, but I think it was Biden’s catastrophic debate with Trump that galvanized this guy into action.  At that point, the realization that Trump was in a much stronger position, with a chance of overpowering the doddering Biden, might have pushed him over the edge. He might have thought that Trump had to be stopped at any cost and it was too risky to let him make it to Election Day.

I’m inclined to agree, doesn’t really disprove my claim that it was a half assed attempt.
Take that ulvade shooter, he spared no expense, if he was the assassin I’m positive we’d be talking about Trump in the past tense right now.

Everyone on mandated SSRI’s. Constant barrage of propaganda. A televised image of the dear leader that was completely fake.
On the plus side: “Gun-Kata”. Bonus: Sean Bean doing what he does best – dying in the movie.

            Yep. They are not going to stop now. With each passing week they will become more desperate to take Trump out or at least intimidate him into bowing out of the race. If Trump continues–and I imagine he will–he will display the courage of a lion.

        Perhaps in time the failed assassination of Trump will be seen as the turning point in the cold civil war, the point when the good guys finally figured out that they are under attack and begin to organize a resistance against the gathering darkness.
God willing.

            Exactly what I’ve been saying to people on the voter fraud part. The same people that think there was funny business in 2020 are saying, “This put the election in the bag for Trump. It’s a lock!” Really? You think they’re all of a sudden going to stop doing that stuff? You think republicans are all of a sudden going to grow a backbone and effectively fight it?

        I don’t subscribe to the Atlantic but I ran across a freebie last night. It was an editorial by cheese-pope David Frum. Go read it if you have a strong stomach. He says that Trump deserved what he got by calling for violence over the last eight years. He actually says this. He says that Trump has taken over the Republican party (for no reason at all in his mind, giving no context.)People are saying that the attempted assassination was a set-up. I think this is exactly right. By the continual calls for violence against Trump, which they will never acknowledge, then the degraded Secret Service protection under Mayorkas, they set him up for this. My question is how Trump will respond going forward. He’s got to find a way to tighten the security if he continues his rallies. No more open-air rallies. It wouldn’t surprise me if the unhinged element calls him a coward but pictures speak a thousand words. They can’t overcome the iconic images and his rallying cry to “Fight!”

                It’s like the picture of the guy in front of the tank at Tienamen Square.  It didn’t end well for him, but he’s immortal as a symbol of humanity facing down tyranny. What’s more, that image can’t be interpreted any other way.

                    It’s like the picture of the guy in front of the tank at Tienamen Square.The Tiananmen Square massacre was fake, so…I’d really REALLY have liked to see a closeup of Trump’s ear because in the existing footage, it doesn’t look like it’s been pierced by a bullet, and both his shirt and the hair right at the top of his ear, are unblemished by blood. After being crushed in the SS scrum like that, it should’ve been all over him.In fact, I have no sure way of even knowing if Butler, PA is real. Never heard of it before, never been there, don’t know anyone from there, it could all be CGI, and maybe they edited the satellite maps when I wasn’t looking.Yeah, I’m being ridiculous, but that’s the timeline we live in soon enough, as Compsci notes above. A cognitive event horizon is coming down, where everything you do not experience in person, is by default suspect. We’re back in the Middle Ages, where all you knew about the outside world was what was in the weekly town crier bulletin.So until further evidence, I’m with Andrew Anglin on this one.And maybe one of you 2A-types could help a gunpoor Eurobro out and tell me what’s going on with that sniper behind Trump, the left-hand guy with the tripod. When the firing starts, he first startles, and then his barrel starts weaving around. Is that a normal recoil? If he’s actually firing that thing and not just trying to find the target, it it seems to me like he’s dropping them all over the landscape.

                        I’ve not seen what you describe, but a weaving barrel would be consistent with finding a target using a high power scope.  Indeed, I usually have to lower the power to 3-6 to locate, then turn the power up to max of 18 or so to acquire precision.  Then comes the breathing regime.  What folks don’t realize is that a quick shot from a sniper is a myth.  What you see in the movies is either simply fake, or after a considerable amount of acquisition/aiming time.  And we’ve not even spoken about windage adjustment.

                            Thanks. The footage is the bit where people say the two SS snipers are aiming straight for the assassin, waiting for him to take his shot.

                                As I noted above, The snipers might have waited until confirmation of the target.  They don’t know at the time the intent, nor who the person who is aiming the rifle is.  It’s not their job to keep track of all the LEO’s on the scene.  That indeed might bear in judging the incident command on the scene.  But I don’t blame the LEO snipers at this point.

                                    Yes, I’m not wondering about whether they’re standing down or waiting for the shooter or whatnot, only the seemingly erratic movements of the barrel, right as you hear the return volley.
I assume the guy didn’t just spray them around in a panic, or we’d have heard about it by now, what with all the talk about an SS competency crisis, but it doesn’t look like any shooting video I’ve seen, neither in movies or documentaries.
Maybe it was the prone guy doing the shooting, it’s a bit hard to see.

                                        The assassin sprayed about 6-8 shots as I counted in a very quick time.  When one does such quick shots, your technique is essential.  If you hold your weapon poorly, your rifle will not settle down back on target (more or less) after recoil.  This means you need to reacquire the target all over again and that takes time.  The temptation is to squeeze the trigger when not quite on target, hence miss.  Wash rise repeat and you get lots of quick misses.  Hitting bystanders does not count.  Again, go to doubt that this guy had knowledge of requisite skills of a trained sniper.

                We’ll all have time to recalibrate our positions on this, but in this case — and at this very moment, I’m watching a YouTube interview by Larry Johnson with former FBI sniper Chris Whitcomb — higher-level involvement at the very moment the events were unfolding looks likely, then I’ll swing to your position. If there was such higher-level involvement then they will attempt a cover-up. That will tell us 100% what happened. And I don’t for a minute say that couldn’t have happened.

        They attack then call for peace before they think the other side has a chance to respond. For close to a decade they have been calling for the death of Trump and his supporters, but now all of a sudden, they think it is time to put aside our differences and come together as brothers. Note that there was no remorse in Biden’s call for unity over the weekend.Interestingly, this is exactly the same script they followed with the failed assassination of Slovak populist PM Robert Fico. First they called for his head, then he was shot and they called for peace and reconciliation, while adding that it’s all his own fault for being too hateful.

            As noted here several times, “it’s all fake and gay”.  Not a one (Leftist/liberal) believes what they say wrt peace and reconciliation.  If you can make the statements I’ve heard now and in the past—even once—you are beyond “redemption”.  You are simply an “evil” and must be destroyed before we can move on in life.  What form that destruction must take perhaps varies, but there is not going to be settlement via handshake and a pledge to be better persons in the future.

                You are exactly correct. I won’t link him or mention him by name, but one prominent online shitlib was gloating over the poor man who died, outright laughing and mocking him, claiming that since he was a Trump supporter, he obviously supported the “insurrection”, Putin, and all the rest. Because of this, he deserved to die. This is what these people actually believe. They hate you and want you dead, they hate you with every fiber of their being, they don’t value life, they don’t value their fellow man, they don’t seek out the Good/Beautiful/True, they have adopted the Deuteronomy worldview, and as such they want you destroyed. This needs to be remembered.

That’s a good interpretation.  I’m a somewhat unrepentant Freudian.  They hate themselves as far as I’m concerned.
However, point I try to make is *not* to hate them back.  Such hate makes you reckless and less effective and physically less able.  Sublimateyour hate into absolute resolve.  You’ll then know what to do when the time comes.  You don’t need to hate cows to work in a slaughter house.

            It’s infuriating, but not as infuriating as this:
If Trump is somehow elected and wants to get anything done, he’s going to need allies.  That means reaching across the aisle.  It means compromising with most of the RINO’s in his own party.
They’ll be no mandate for this guy.  Even if the R’s swept everything, they wouldn’t know what to do with it.  We’ve seen this happen before.
What does Team R even want?  They just want power and sinecures, there is no grand vision.

        Over the weekend, I went from lean stay home to lean Trump (which really doesn’t matter either way in my solid color state), and it was primarily because of the fist pump. Which demonstrated authenticity and genuine spirit, things sorely lacking in our professional political class. However silly/lazy/misguided/coopted he may be, it showed that he cares. These days, the bar is just that low.If the Democrats are going to scale back their Evil Fascist End of Democracy Orange Man strategy, then what platform do they have? That was pretty much their whole campaign. It’s either that or concede defeat. What else are they going to run on, their success in the Great Replacement?

            If Trump survives till the election, I think he’s earned our vote. And I say that as a hardcore abstainer. It won’t do us any good, of course, but giving him support might do Trump a bit of good from a personal standpoint.

        This event will highlight another feature of the managerial state often cited by the Zman, which is the lack of accountability of key actors. In a sane world, the director of the Secret Service would have fired the team responsible for Trump’s security and announced her resignation by now. Alas, in our world there will be no accountability.

            They held a press conference yesterday in Milwaukee. The female head of the local Secret Cervix team for the convention — who thinks she’s a young Kate Winslet — displayed nothing but brazen contempt and arrogance for the questions from the media. Most of her sentences began with “Soooo…” followed by a passive-aggressive non-response to the substance of the question. No shame. None.

                “They must all be removed from their offices. They will not change. These are people in their 30s and 40s. Out with them. The whole order must be overturned.”We need to return/become a “shame culture”.  Seems most no one is ashamed of their failures and seeks always to blame others and defer responsibility—whether correct or incorrect in such assumption.  There is no “the buck stops here” thinking anymore.A few years back, there was a tragedy in South Korea where a ferry taking a HS class on an overnight trip capsized, killing the students aboard.  The captain of the boat was asleep in his cabin and the first mate was on duty in control room.  This was standard procedure—hell the captain has to sleep sometime, right?Well, not in SK it seems.  The captain was so ashamed that he committed suicide the next day or so.  He was, after all, the head person on the boat and responsibility simply—in the Korean culture—fell to him for all actions of the crew.But wait, there’s more.  The HS official who was responsible for scheduling the trip and hiring the boat company also committed suicide to atone for his role in this tragedy.  After all, he should have known better than to hire such a company.  Huh?Hell, I’d be happy if we just simply fired a few of our incompetents rather than continuously allowing them to “fail up”!

        In 1066 at the battle of Hastings the english were winning. then their king was struck in the eye by an arrow and the tide turned and the course of history was changed. this time Trump turned his head slightly to look at a giant video screen showing a chart of illegal immigration and thus the bullet missed by a hair…and likely the course of history was changed. And we know what happened when the Archduke Ferdinand decided to take the long way home. July 13 definitely looks like an inflection point to me.

        Until now, the cold civil war has been a one-sided affair, because white people did not know there was a war. They told each other that the actions of the regime were for money or power. Now they are starting to sense it is about something else. The “existential threat” is not against “their democracy” but against heritage Americans. If the regime thinks killing Trump is funny, they will have no qualms about killing you and your family.Exactly. To add to Sun Tzu, first you have to know you even have an enemy. Those of us who are outliers sometimes suffer from the hubris of thinking only we are capable of understanding the Secret Knowledge we possess, that the rubes and Normies and Grillers never will learn The Truth. I’m guilty, to be honest, and I’m as wrong as everyone else who thinks this way. Outliers simply get to the head of the line first. The number behind us is swelling now. It will explode. Wewillwin. Just as no one is willing to die any longer for this evil Regime, no one is willing to be killed by it, either.The die is cast. Our enemies are ruthless but reckless and just turned the ball over on the one-yard line. It will prove fatal to them. They shot at a pretty lame king and missed, but the quality of their target does not matter. I hope and pray the separation that is coming is peaceful but fully expect it not to be.

                Thanks. I had thought Trump was being lined up to be the Judas Goat to get young white males from the South and the Midwest to join the military. That may have been the case, but the almost assuredly State-sponsored assassination attempt has put paid to that.

                    Also, if we assume the assassination attempt was hatched within the Power Structure, we must conclude that the judiciary, in the main, has not yet been enfolded within the Power Structure. Too many court cases going Trump’s way these days.

                        The lingering traces of an independent judiciary are unexpected but not without precedent–that’s happened a few times in Latin America, with Nicaragua and Bolivia springing to mind. The leftists down there resorted to violence and general mau-mauing of the judges, not unlike what we have seen here prior to DOBBS and outside courthouses handling the Trump cases. I obviously believe the system is far beyond repair and reform, but if it were at all possible (or desirable) it would require an independent judiciary and a military and domestic police agency purge on an unprecedented scale.

He never once said the words “white people”, but has praised Dreamers, shelled out to blacks with the platinum plan, bragged about the vax, deferred to Javanka, and made clear he’s ready for total war for Israel.If he wins, or rather is allowed to win, I’ll be various curious to see if he is this time going to war with the Deep State or will again simply be pleading to be allowed to have some legitmacy as he governs as a “big tent” republican who wants to cut taxes, be patriotic, and be friends with everybody while they hate him anyway.Again, unclear what Trump will do or what he is capable of.

        I expect to learn that the shooter had been on SSRIs or similar meds, and had been in therapy. That would follow the general pattern of younger shooters all the way back to Columbine.Then look into who had been in his orbit.Curious that his phone is super, hyper, totally secure, too.

            Phone numbers of whom he called and texted for the recent past are routinely stored and, to my knowledge, not strongly protected private information (e.g. easy available to the law.) Same for location data, possibly also for certain mobile data (DNS searches for instance.) Of course, actual messages could be recorded but that should require a warrant or equivalent. I know almost zero about physical unit, but only a fool would think the spooks don’t have backdoors engineered into most operating systems. As I’ve outlined above, however, the Law wouldn’t even gain much by full access to his mobile, since in normal use substantially all of its use, and much of its data, is routinely copied to the cloud.

            If it’s who they say it is, his parents were both in psychology—maybe even (((psychology))). Kid never had a chance. Drugs would be the least of his brain damage.He’s absent from the internet, so maybe he really was an unusual guy. But erasure can be arranged. It looks like the last thing they got around to deleting was an ad he appeared in—a BlackRock ad. Cute joke, feds.We’ll never learn about him. Conservatives have reverted to form, just calling him a loser. Whenever they find a reason to do that, they’re done thinking. And Democrats have found a reason to call him a Republican.Story’s over!

I legitimately don’t get Trump’s thinking, the VP pick is supposed to protect you from assassins, not make killing you an easy choice for the people with that power. He flip flops from brilliant to paint chip eating retard in his decision making at the drop of a hat.

                Funny how Vance thought Trump was “cultural heroin” back when Trump was making speeches about the forgotten man and how heritage Americans have been taking it in the shorts for 75 years, but now that Trump is talking about stapling green cards to the diplomas of people like Vance’s wife, now it is okay to view Trump favorably and join team Trump.Choosing an Asian is an instant sign that a white guy is subpar, and that goes doubly for subcontinental ones.I had originally planned on not voting this year, which went to wanting to support Trump after his Saturday badassery, but this pick is an instant “fuck voting” for me.

            Vance is just about the only “name” Republican who isn’t currently anti-Trump. He’s an absolute scumbag and if he becomes president we’re doomed—and by “we” I meanus specifically; not even Schumer hates us more—but the list is very short. Voters don’t know, and campaigns are for them.

        If it is civil war the left wants, it is civil war they will get. And they will lose, have no doubt.Perverts, lunatics, and doddering seniors CANNOT rule. Leaders need to produce pease, order, and security in order for the society to create a standard of living and keep their citizens happy. The left can only produce chaos, fear, and debacle. Their own people are turning on them and each other. We can literally sit back and given time they will destroy themselves. The problem with that is that the longer it takes for them to do that, the more innocent people they are going to kill.And – there was no conspiracy here. You cannot fake incompetence like that. Spoiler alert – that is the level of readiness not only for the secret service – but for the Marines, Army, Navy and Airforce as well. Welcome to vibrant and diverse times.

        The regime put Biden on TV last night because too many people believe the regime ordered the hit.  It wasn’t maybe a week ago that Biden called for Trump to be put in the crosshairs.  And he’s been making these weird whispery threats since the debate that Trump is going to experience some sort of major “challenge”.Old people don’t have good filters.  Maybe the reason Biden hadn’t dropped out is because he expected Trump to drop dead.The regime has run multiple hoaxes, two absurd impeachments, 5-6 civil and criminal cases to fine him a billion dollars and try to lock him up for 500 years.  Getting some loser Antifa terrorist to “sneak” onto a roof unseen to try and kill Trump is a piece of cake for these people.  They’ve got 1,000 more lone wolves they can tap.The thing nobody is saying yet that Trump needs to say – but won’t – is that there needs to be an independent investigation that completely bypasses the FBI.  And if the FBI was involved criminally, let’s find that out.No sane person is relieved to hear that the FBI is leading the investigation.

        “So their vision of unity is, really, everyone becoming a liberal.”
Exactly, unfortunately some/most of the “Normies” buy into the lie of “unity”, which really means “capitulation“ to Leftist values. Normies tend to think the situation is like choosing what color to paint your house.
There are values which define one’s very concept of what it is to be a moral and decent person in this world, those values cannot be compromised without becoming an indecent person yourself.
And so it goes….

            Well said. I often make a similar argument to leftists in my life, generally regarding religion. Leftists have this belief that different religions simply means calling God a different name, celebrating different holidays, and eating different foods. They don’t grasp that it means very different answers for what construes a moral person, how we should live, and what our society should look like. Their talk about unity is really around their own neo-liberal secularism as the primary moral guide.

                “…it means very different answers for what construes a moral person, how we should live, and what our society should look like. “
That’s what it’s all about isn’t it?  Too bad it took some of us so damn long to learn this.

        The Republican softball shooting, Shinzo Abe, Robert Fico, Donald Trump…recent political violence has been remarkably one sided. Yet they want to try and tell US to tone down the rhetoric and unify. If a MAGA person had taken the same shot at Joe, everyone in this comment section would probably be on a train to the gulag right now. Hopefully this becomes an inflection point for normies, and perhaps Trump himself. Optimistically, I hope that everything they’re doing to him only hardens his mettle to what he needs to do IF he gets into office.

        The federal judge in Florida just dismissed the classified documents case against Trump. She ruled the appointment of Jack Smith was unconstitutional, which of course means the clown show in D.C. is as well unless the Supreme Court finds otherwise. People like Smith soon will be offered up as human sacrifices to try to appease the gathering mob. Bank it.

            The timing. I don’t blame anyone who believes the regime decided Trump is their guy and is now moving heaven and earth to make it happen. Although the blatant illegality of Smith’s position shouldn’t even need to be pointed out, and would be controversial only to retards and willful liars.

        I read a blog post that perfectly encapsulates my current mindset regarding leftists. It is actually a riff off of something Andrew Torba wrote on Gab but the guy expanded the language quite a bit. I could not have said this better myself.Hat tip to the based Italian bro Giuseppe Filotto for penning this. If even a small fraction of normies put this plan into place it would have ripple effects through society but your average person is indeed a coward and afraid of confrontation or being called an “ist” of some sort.I was already pretty much operating under Torba’s guidelines, but I like this guy’s “expanded” version much better.https://www.gfilotto.com/andrew-torbas-comment

            Apex:  Interesting read, but I cannot wholeheartedly endorse it.  Going into local politics or replacing a degenerate teacher assumes that piecemeal change will work and that the underlying institutions and systems are sound.  They are not.  Aggressive self-defense and pushback will get you arrested and your family destroyed.  And the truth is no defense when POX lies rule the day.I did what Torba advocates (cutting off all association with liberals) back in 2008.  Cut off some long-time friends and essentially all extended family.  I have never looked back and my life has been the better for it.  I thank God daily that my husband and I ‘retreated’ into the woods 15 months ago.  Our lives are infinitely better because we’ve minimized our exposure to the filth of modern “American” life.If millions of people were to do the same (instead of the usual calls for reason, reconciliation, and forgiveness), then we’d start to see some changes.  But relying on the wisdom of the crowd is a fool’s errand, and I cannot see that what Mr. Filotto advocates leads to anything positive.

                “I did what Torba advocates (cutting off all association with liberals) back in 2008. Cut off some long-time friends and essentially all extended family.”Agree with this approach — my caveat being that I cut them off emotionally, but they do not know it. They really are too self-absorbed to realize that my interactions with them consist mostly of observation, and in those cases they provide fodder for derision, proof of concept, to be share with others not of their stripe.Meets the “keep your friends close and your enemies closer…” mantra and there IS some sense in that. By giving them nothing — again they are too dense and solipsistic — and that includes very ‘successful’ ones with all the $$$ trappings of the ‘success’ and status they worship.The difference being first hand observation, compared to second and third hand. Trust? Zero given. Sharing private thoughts? Not on your life. Observe, exploit, deride —- and if and when you discard, never a word, total ghost.It really is easy once you have removed yourself emotionally.

And the truth is no defense when POX lies rule the day.You are speaking with the living embodiment of this as you know. I have walked down this awful road, so you are right, that part I should have caveated because its 100% true.They will throw the book at you for sure. My take home there was being non-verbal vs. being verbal. Not threats, just a “get the f-ck away from me” type thing. The same way I don’t want a Jehovah’s Witness trying to pitch me their religion, I don’t worship your DEI god so stop talking about it. Also the colorblind kumbaya crap was weak.

        I return from the dentist and peruse the headlines and Golly Gee, Trump picked JD Vance as veep.  I suppose – as a White man – he is the least bad of the options Trump was considering (conservatards, blacks, women), but this just reaffirms my decision not to vote.  Usha Vance may be a very nice women – but it doesn’t matter in the least.  She and her children represent the dilution, subsummation, and ultimate extinction of the White European race.  Assuming Trump were to somehow win and serve a full term, Vance would be a frontrunner to be president in 2028 (assuming AINO is still standing).  Can’t you see all the headlines now?  “The New Face of Murka!”  “The Modern, All-Murkan Family!”  Barf.  Gaah.  No. NO. NO. NOOOOOOO.

        Z is absolutely bang-on about the reflexive Leftist response when they sense the tide has turned against them. Suddenly, they become oh so irenic and conciliatory, proferring the fig leaf of peace and brotherly love.This is what happened after 9/11, too, you’ll recall. Leftist constituents (Sand Hutus) visited the most horrific act of death and destruction on American soil ever (worse than the Civil War and Pearl Harbor because civilians were the primary targets), and in the aftermath we saw a powerful upsurge in patriotism. American flags suddenly sprouted from every car antenna and every domestic awning.Naturally, this horrified the Left (far more than 9/11 itself). They sensed that the project of diversifying America into oblivion was being put in jeopardy. Because the terrorists were brown muzzies, diversity itself was being rigorously interrogated.Then the Left did what they always do in these rare situations. They demanded that their opponents cool off and regain their calm. They claimed that 9/11 was not acasus bellibut rather an opportunity for greater tolerance, understanding and intercultural comity.They were terrified that white Americans, justifiably outraged, would strike back and put an end to their dispossession and subjugation. Naturally, of course, the Left’s pacific rhetoric was nothing more than a delaying action and was 100 percent insincere. The gambit was to tamp down any scrutiny of Leftist machinations, douse the embers of fury, and once the danger was past, reignite the anti-white project.And they got what they wanted. White people eventually lost interest in the lessons of 9/11 and again acquiesced to their own destruction as a people.I would like to think it will be different this time ’round. That Trump’s near assassination will create a durable, vigorous white identitarian movement. Alas, I can’t say I’m particularly hopeful on that score.

I agree, Ostei.  I’ve said it here before and I’ll say it again – as long as we dirt folk have a warm house, a cold fridge, and a hot spot, there will BE NO REVOLUTION.

            I don’t think any of that requires a left/”left,” though they do take advantage. The core American value isidentification with the aggressor(often wrongly diagnosed as Stockholm Syndrome).
Muslims bring the war home? Give them your cities. Blacks rape and rob you? Set them free. Jews brag that their plans to destroy you are almost complete? Worship them harder. Corporations collude to exclude your children from the economy? Tax cuts. Cops beat your grandma at the MAGA rally? Fellatio. The military disobeys and overthrows your commander in chief? OUR BRAVE BOYS
It’severything.

                But the American version of Stockholm Syndrome was nowhere in evidence prior to the second half of the 60s when a new, virulent and more evil form of Leftism came to the fore. If Stockhom Syndrome it is, it is the creation of the New Left.

        I think Biden and Mayorkas are afraid.Biden has had THREE video appearances. The one late Saturday night, the one on mid-Sunday, with Harris, Mayorkas, and Garland, and the one later Sunday night.The one with his cabinet members and Harris was telling. Forget the words, look at the body language. Harris (from left to right on stage) was confused and afraid, picking up on Biden and Mayorkas’s fear. Both looked afraid and Mayorkas looked like a political dead man walking. Tellingly, Garland was smirking, until he realized the camera was on him and quickly frowned. It was remarkable.We know there were 9 separate requests from Trump’s team for more security, all denied. And RFK Jr. has no security.My guess, only a guess but I think borne out by the fear shown by Biden and Mayorkas and the smirks by Garland (who believes himself untouchable), is that Mayorkas had Biden sign an order / directive that Trump be given only bare minimum security required and that furthermore only the most junior people be assigned to his team. And that further, no outgoing fire was to be allowed without direct authorization. In short, a passive-aggressive assassination plan, one “clever” in that it was bureaucratic not direct action.However, a retired fire chief was murdered by the shooter, and two others seriously wounded.There is ample video of the Secret Service and local cops taking no action as a dude in clear view crawls up on the roof with a rifle. For three or four minutes.The families of the victims are certain to sue, and sue directly Biden and Mayorkas for failing to provide proper security and as “private” actions that is going to put them in the cross hairs like Trump has been, even more so if Dr. Jill and First Crackhead sat in on meetings where this policy was crafted. There are people like Elon Musk and Bill Ackman able and willing to fund those kinds of lawsuits and prosecutions, out of a desire for brushback (both have had actions against them by the Bidens for years now).There is almost certainly copies of this directive if it exists, floating around as insurance policy for a CYA. No one will fall on their sword for the mumbler in chief.

        From the outside looking in, after this weekend, America seems like a super-sized version of early 1990s Colombia. Except the main export is not Cocaine, but war, miscegenation and gay porn. But the murderous energy is there alright. Since I know and like many Americans and our fate as European vassals very much depends on who takes power in DC, I very much hope that Trump and the decent people of flyover country will be able to manage a return to sanity.

                There was a recent story to the effect that 37 Mexican candidates [for political office] were assassinated by the Mossad so that (((Sheinbaum))) could seize control.
https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-candidate-assassinations-hit-grim-record-ahead-sundays-election-2024-06-01/
For those of you who don’t know, the (((Sephardim))) were yuge in Mexico, and my suspicion is that very large numbers of mestizos &amp; castizas have Sephardic blood.
There were so many j00z in Mexico that Lev Davidovich Bronstein fled there, in an attempt to hide from Saint Joseph Djugashvili.
Fortunately, however, Saint Joseph hunted down Bronstein, and drove an icepick through Bronstein’s skull.

            “…after this weekend, America seems like a super-sized version of early 1990s Colombia”Sure, it can be seen as such from a recent time perspective.  But go back to the 60’s—70’s for a longer perspective.  JFK assassinated, RFK and MLK assassinated, Malcolm X assassinated, the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) Liberation Front bank robberies, Bull Conor and dogs and fire hoses, Patty Hearst kidnapping, Black Panthers marching with weapons in Sacramento, students shot down in Ohio State by the national Guard, Vietnam war protests galore and the 68 Tet offensive.  Fun times to be had all around.“Violence is as American as apple pie” said H. Rap Brown.  And so it is….

                I mean it does makes some sense in that Indians are going to have some level on intrinsic resentment towards Whites obviously, since their people were subservient to the British until pretty recently, but man… indians are lolcows socio-culturally. “plz bobs, vagine, etc.”
Well actually I guess that makes sense too. You don’t want your janissaries to be strong lest you end up falling to the Mamluks.

                    I think there is also an undercurrent that Indians get special treatment as a wedge or bribe against the Chinese. By placating or selling out your country to India, you keep them in the Western Sphere, when it would otherwise lean at the very least unaligned, or possibly even anti-Western/Atlanticist.The thing is, one of the major deals made with India is just to let them flood your country, instead of the standard bribes in Central Asia etc. where you simply invest in some infrastructure and a handful of fixers get enriched.India has its own homegrown billionaires and power nexi, after all.Sorry to bore people with the Antipodes, but here Down Undah there is a definite but subtle subtext that the centre-left leans Chinese and the centre-right leans Hindu, especially if you look into who tends to benefit from their respective corruption scandals.I also remember a while back us making some deals with India to get them onboard with AUKUS or pacific containment and a sweetener was sold as “mutual education opportunities” which is obviously just an excuse for millions of coolies to flood in and practice their Bobs and Vergana skills.And the whole UK Conservative Party/Hindu thing over there.

                        Another thing is the Anglo-Indian imperial relationship stretching back centuries. India provided vast reservoirs of soldiers and manpower for British military might: once they were done, the Empire was gone. India really was the “jewel in the crown”. I think there is still some nostalgia for that among Anglo elites…like their nostalgia for the “Great Game” against Russia.One more thing: India/Anglo-India does produce some top-class people. There is some serious talent, and they have a definite “meeting of minds” with the upper caste of WASP society on both sides of the Atlantic (especially the eastern shore). Speaking from my own experience &amp; acquaintances.

        I think also, a Hot Civil War is inevitable at this point. Elites are divided, with some significant elements aligned with Trump and MAGA. Others are all in with Obama/Biden.The DOJ is intent on prosecuting Trump right up to his inauguration, if he wins, and possibly beyond. The DOJ seems to imply they are the master, not the servant.Meanwhile, people are asking:How is it a 20 year old has NO Social Media history or presence?How did he stash a rifle and ladder in a secure area?How did he just casually move the ladder up onto the roof and climb up the ladder with a rifle, in full view of everyone including police?It won’t end even or especially if Trump wins. And explicitly, it will not just stop with Trump. That’s why he has some scared elites on his side. Elon Musk noted he had in the past months two separate attempts on his life by armed men within a twenty minute drive of Tesla HQ.If it comes to that, how well with the DEI military, police, Girl Bosses, and diverse and vibrant “newcomers” work against people with literally nothing to lose and nowhere to flee?

        Never forget that they are relatively few in number. And they will flee rapidly as an emergent behavior when properly motivated. And the fog of chaos fundamentally defeats the jackboot cordon. They have imported millions of military age males with the intent of sowing harm against the bottom of the societal pyramid. But these mercenaries can be incentivized and redirected toward the root of the problem. That should be the first wave. Everything else is clean-up.

        I hope you are right Z but I have my doubts. Middle America is an optimistic lot and apple pie and baseball runs deep, most still think Walt Disney content is still Snow White and the seven dwarfs.Optimism is a long candle that is still burning, even with Trump I predict.The calls are going out by the lunatics to have peace, cross that aisle and shake hands, no harm done.Trump now has the support of the big boys like Bill Ackman.Trump still I think believes that he can be Ronald Reagan and Ronald Reagan dodged a death bullet too, only to bring us a high stock market and billions more in debt, and done little to stop the managerial states march.I don’t think white normie is radicalized much at all by this, just a talking point for a week, then on we go.Let’s all just get along as Rodney King said.I hope that I am wrong.

                    I think we who inhabit boards like this underestimate how much normie believes we can return to Ronald Reagan America. Trump believes this strongly I think. The key will be Trumps picks for those around him and it starts with his VP pick. If the VP pick is a friend of the Republican establishment then we can count on Trump, should he get in again, playing Ronald Reagan.The left will wait him and his demographic out and the ratchet wrench will turn again in four years.

            “Let’s all just get along as Rodney King said….”
I respect your sentiment, but King did not said that.  What he said was, “Can’t we all just get along?”  And the answer is *no*, we all just can’t get along—for the thousand reasons given here in this group of DR’ers now and in the past.

            G Lordon Giddy:  I see it largely as you do.  But  most people are optimists, and desperate to believe that good always wins in the end.  Any common sense points you could make will be booed today by people high on hope.  Nothing to do other than wait things out.

                3g4me, I’ve just rewatch the old Lord Of The Rings trilogy and come away with a bit of a different take on your comment.Most people are cowards in the face of evil.  Optimism backed by *inaction* is only a cover and hope is a detriment to positive action.  In the LOTR’s stories, every battle scene is one of the good characters abandoning all hope, and in such facing evil because it is better to die fighting such than to live under evil.In the abandonment of hope, Tolkien elevates the heroic actions of the good into a sublime act of sacrifice, which in the end defeats evil.  Of course, Tolkien was a devote Christian and patterned the entire story around Christ’s sacrifice on the cross.Nonetheless, there seems a point made for us here if we can understand it.

        Two big Ifs and a small But:If the goal is to appeal to white people, now is not the time to be countersignalling Trump, Vance’s wife, democracy, any of this.  At least not in public.  Fuentes grasped this immediately and shifted his rhetorical fire from Trump to Project 2025 in masterful fashion, and I say this as a non-fan.Ifthe trend holds, the GOP is going to roll and will increase its share of the nonwhite vote to the point that conservative boomers can croak feeling righteous and vindicated.  No amount of waving around Table 43 by any geriatric White Whisperer is going to change any of this.But pointing out the fact that the calls for murdering Trump have come from Jews, Jew-owned or Jew-produced media, or Jew-owned politicians may be a good idea, depending on the audience.  This has the advantage of being both moral and, for the moment, expedient.  Going from sound asleep to Naxalt is progress, especially in the event that Trump is handed a poisoned chalice in the form of a wider war in the Middle East.

            “…in the event that Trump is handed a poisoned chalice in the form of a wider war in the Middle East.”
If he wins the election (doubtful, given the rigging and 10 million voting illegals) and escapes assassination (surely they will try again), last roll of the dice is spark hot war with Iran/Russia and leave Trump holding the bag. Powerless to move against the onrush of events (so they hope).

        There is irony that the spiteful mutants who are invoking the bad Uvalde/Parkland/Sandy Hook gun-toting school shooters yet cheering/agonizing over the Trump assassination attempt are in a sense rooting for the bullied shooter trying to kill the Big Bully.

        I hope Z-man is right, and this is an inflection point, but this was merely oneattemptedassassination. The 1960s saw quite a few assassinations – successful ones, but at that time they were targeted at leftist politicians. The late 1960s were so white-hot politically, Boomers are still getting misty-eyed over their part in it, and many still think the country is run by greedy racist WASPS.I would not be surprised if Trump gets shot at again. I would also not be surprised if a right winger starts taking shots, psyop or otherwise, so that the Regime can claim that there are “nuts on both sides” and do the equivocation they love doing. This may be the chaos the regime is looking for, instead of Antifa riots this time around. Instead of school shootings, we’re going to have rally shootings. And if more than one politician gets shot, or God forbid dies, then we are back to the late 1960s all over again. Which was the last inflection point, by the way. Would the long-hairs and progressives start their long march through the institutions again? Or will it be young conservatives this time around?

            “Days of Rage – America’s Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Revolutionary Violence.”In the 60’s an early 70’s, bombings were an almost daily occurrence and assassinations were commonplace.  The white leaders did short prison sentences then went on the long march through the institutions.  (they won).(Black leaders went to jail for a long, long time)I agree with you though…I honestly thought they’d have the most ridiculous over the top Florida Man MAGA Patriot Front Proud Boy target the other team to justify a Jan 6 x 1 million crackdown.

                            It’s a dumb question. Hinckley shot Reagan because in his delusional mind, he thought it would impress Jodi Foster, whom he was obsessed with. His delusion’s were compounded by the fact that Foster is a lesbian. Politic’s played no part in his motivation.

            Could it be said that the attempt on Reagan was truly an outlier, attempted by a mentally unhinged man looking for recognition from a Hollywood star, as opposed to a politically motivated individual? I’m sure there are various conspiracy theories on Reagan’s shooter, but it comes across, superficially, as simply a madman doing mad things.

                The conflating factor in 1981 was the rise in drug trafficking and the associated crime involved as the money flow increased.  Drug use spread from low life inner city to more chic upscale neighborhoods and clientele.  As lone as drug use was a lower SES kind of thing, it was tolerated.Crime of course entailed violence using firearms, particularly handguns, hence “Handgun Inc” after the Reagan/Brady shooting.  Brady became the symbol for the movement to ban handguns—but the precedent or firearm control was already set by the laws I cited above.  1934 allowed infringement of the 2nd Amendment as to what could be considered legal to own.  1968 allowed restriction of who could own and sell.  Those were the two biggies.  Nothing after—including the Brady Act—could hold a candle to those two acts, without which we’d now have no anti 2nd Amendment laws in effect.

        An assassination attempt two days before a republican convention nobody was going to watch? Call me skeptical.unseen1@unseen1_unseenThe story so far.  A loner who lives more than an hour away with less than a week to review the spot and figure out the security zone to escape detection from law enforcement and the secret service while carrying a rifle through a crowd of thousands finds a hole in said security,  climbs up to a roof with a perfect view of the stage and has enough time to take  4 or 5 shots at  the head of the former President with bystanders screaming out his location and sniper nests on overwatch…hey anyone want to buy a bridge? Either he was the luckiest person alive, law enforcement, and the secret setvice are the new keystone cops, or……Take your pick and as always think as you will….

                For whatever reason, the idea that there is no one with any competence at the helm of the ship terrifies people in ways that even the idea of evil supergeniuses in volcano lairs does not.Hence the urge to 9D chess every happening instead of accepting that yes, the secret service is just as riddled with incompetent diversity hires as everywhere else these days.It’s an amazing testament to the system the long gone competent white guys built that these sorts of fuck ups don’t happen more frequently than they do. I have a buddy who worked as an assembler at the 787 plant down in SC, who told me a decade ago that the DIE hire put in charge of operations there had switched the assemblers to doing their own QA checks on their subassemblies. But that dusky retard’s decision has taken 10 years to bubble up into panels blowing off midair because of how rigorous the original engineering was.

                        It would be child’s play for him to have squeezed a red dye pack on his ear. His hand was on the side of the lectern right before he lifted it to his ear, so it could have been concealed there. And the famous picture of the bullet whizzing by in the air could well have been doctored for all we know.But the difficult illusion to pull off is the other people who were hit/killed. If it was fake, and I’m not saying that it was, then this is where to look for chinks in the armor of the facade.I have a hard time believing this was staged, I’m more inclined to believe inside job (vs. the staggeringly unbelievable incompetence of leaving the roof unsecured), but I am willing to consider all possibilities.

                            A picture of a bullet in the air is hard to believe.  I need to see it.  If we are talking about 5.56 AR rounds, you have a bullet leaving the barrel at 3200 fps.  For a 22 caliber round that’s a small, fast object to spot and film for any civilian camera.  Best I’ve ever seen is a trail left behind a 45 cal (slow) pistol round standing directly behind the shooter.
Color me skeptical.

                                You’re not seeing the round, you’re seeing the trail of vapor caused by the passing of the round. This occurs under very humid conditions. If you’ve ever seen footage of naval aircraft doing flyby’s past the carriers, you notice what appears to be “fog” forming on the leading edge of the wings. It’s the same thing here.

As if they would hesitate to kill a few randos to give it verisimilitude. I think the theory here is that no shot went near him – the dead bystanders were far away from Trup.

                                Again, as explained above, could be due to wild shooting and poor technique in holding the rifle and reacquiring the target.  This is common among the untrained in stressful situations.

                            “the difficult illusion to pull off is the other people who were hit/killed” … I agree with this and this is definitely red flag, but at the same time, we now know about crisis actors. It’s also not inconceivable that former military were recruited to play these roles, resurfacing when the time is right.Everything is so easily doctored and manipulated anymore, I think the most prudent thing is to be skeptical.I, for one, still refuse to believe Ashley Babbitt was actually killed without first hand knowledge and why not, given that the Las Vegas shooter was a sock puppet that was invented?

                There’s only one thing that doesn’t make sense to me. I am willing to believe that it was just total incompetence from Secret Service, but if I put myself in the shooter’s head, how do I know that the SS is totally incompetent? I would expect that, by crawling on the roof less than 2 football fields away from Trump, with a massive rifle, in broad daylight, would get me killed in a second. It wouldn’t even be worth trying because I would be gunned down instantly. For him to do this, he would be making a massive bet that they wouldn’t fire upon him.

                Granted this is still a developing story. Per data from this blog:https://www.coffeeandcovid.com/p/unity-monday-july-15-2024-c-and-cOne has to believe the sniper set up a tall ladder, climbed a building and set up a sniper post, allegedly was accosted by an officer whose fate is uncertain, was somehow overlooked by trained security offers who would presumably spot such obvious anomalies, etc. etc.One could give Mr. Sniper the benefit of the doubt in that he was somehow clever enough to smuggle in the ladder and rifle ahead of time, since carrying either, especially the latter, from the parking lot one would think would draw the attention of police.If the above are true, at the very least it was gross negligence on the part of those tasked to provide security.

                    I suspect this was emergent behavior on the part ofonegovernment agency. The incompetence either was intentional or known, it is hard to tell which it is, and does not matter. For example, an elevated location would have been a priority for security. I suspect a TLA sent a Manchurian Candidate to do the dirty. Think how different the JFK assassination aftermath would have been if there were ubiquitous back then.

                First of all you have to go on the dark side and believe that Q is coming from official sources. Once you’ve gone over to the dark side, it’s easy to believe.Eric Trump appeared twice on X-22 Report, which is the number one Q podcast. He ties current events to Q posts toward the end of his daily podcasts.You know how political messaging works. Eric Trump, husband of the head of the RNC and son of the president, wouldn’t touch that place with a 10-ft pole if they wanted to disavow it.You also have to remember the movie “Argo” (true story) and rumors about Kubrick and the moon landing (open to debate). Dr. Steve Pieczenik is on Team Trump. He used to write movie scripts with Tom Clancy. I wouldn’t bet the farm on it, but it’s plausible to me that there is something else going on here.

                    Arthur Conan Doyle’s true passion was not Sherlock Holmes, or even writing in general. Doyle reserved his most energetic zeal to spreading the gospel of what he called”spiritism”, i.e. talking to the dead in seances.Doyle pooh pooh’d the unbelievers. Why, he had ample proof! Had done it himself! Ofcourseyou can talk to the spirits of the departed dead! He wrote whole books giving his irrefutable evidences for spiritism to a public too foolish to believe his iron clad proofs.Towards the end of his life he became fixated on his hobby. Nobody could dissuade the man; his faith was unshakeable. Doyle was a wealthy author, his name known around the globe in his own lifetime and after his own death. Doyle wasn’t stupid, wasn’t retarded, was by nearly all measures a successful man who had done exceedingly well for himself. Yet such was his conviction in spiritism that he fell for a well known hoax perpetrated by a young Victorian girl who claimed to have photographed a real, live fairy. Doyle went to his grave believing the photo was genuine.Some people go in for Scientology or Christian Science. Others become apostles for seances and fairies.And some go in for Q. What are ya gonna do?

            I’ve seen a purported aerial pic of the building and a line drawn from gunman to stage.  The roof area used for shot is huge, however flat with white roof coating.  It literally forms the entire side of the field Trump was speaking from.  One or two SS agents patrolling on top of that roof would have prevented any gunman from ascending and taking station for the shot.  Something is amiss here, very amiss.
But what do I know.  I’m a conspiracy theorist.  🙁

            Not to mention, conveniently, all the alt-media personalities who masquerade as dissidents are back on the Trump Train. I said just months ago these characters were setting it up for a comeback story since the court cases wouldn’t legit result in anything. Here we are.Demoralize, energize. Demoralize, energize. That’s the game. Trust nothing! Definitely not your old democratic institutions we’ve destroyed! Except trust this obv fake “outsider” I promote! Now we get to hear trash from these influencers for the next 4 or 5 years about how Trump has learned and is going to cross the Rubicon. Legit. He’s got your back (this time!) (again!) (please clap!)

I have seen people claim that the assassination was faked so that Trump wins the election. The same people also claimed that elections are fake too. You can’t have it both ways.

                    I don’t think Trump is that ham-handed. This might be out there, but I think it was faked as part of the reveal for what happened to JFK. Or maybe a reenactment of a previous assassination attempt we don’t know about.

And voting is fake and gay, at least on the federal level. Voting probably works if you run for fire chief or dog catcher.

                            OK, so if voting is fake and gay, what is the purpose of the great optics?
I agree that the image of bloodied Trump with his fist up is cool, btw.

                                    The snag in that is that Trump actually listens to what the people want and his allegiance is to the people first and foremost not to Elon or Theil.

                                Optics is even more important when your legitimacy is under scrutiny – that’s why Hitler spent a lot of time and money on optics, even if there were no elections to the Reichstag.
And optics can be used for a lot of things, not just to win elections, as 9/11 demonstrates.

                                    Sure, but I am still getting an incoherent picture. What is the purpose in this case? How does a cool picture of Trump increase the regime’s legitimacy? Or is it Trump’s legitimacy? I just don’t get it.
If you are explicitly saying that this was not faked to make Trump win, then you seem to be in the minority among the people claiming that this was a fake attempt.

Fair question.
I don’t know, it just feels scripted. But as someone said earlier, a lot of disillusioned MAGA folks are back on the train with a vengeance, and the optics makes for great recruitment posters for WWIII.
And yes, that doesn’t make sense either, because the shooter wasn’t Iranian or Russian, but it still feels very, very pat, very cinematic.

                                            Thanks for the answer Felix. Sorry for pushing, but what is the point of getting the MAGA folks excited again if not voting?And voting is fake and gay. See my problem?You could argue that Trump will get installed and that excited MAGA folks are more likely to join WWIII and that would make some sense. Is that it?Plausible, but IMO not necessary for them.Honestly, I don’t see anything wrong with the simple theory that some young deluded moron wanted to be a hero and a few helpful agents made it easy for him. Plan A was to get Trump killed without being implicated. If not, it’s OK, because there are always plans B and C etc.

Is that it?Just a suggestion. If my theory is true, this is just act one, and we’ll know more after the next few episodes have been aired. If the next episode involves some kind of Pearl Harbor, this episode has set Trump up for warlord status.And voting is gay because politicians don’t have any real power, but it matters a lot who your flesh puppet is, if you want to start a world war. Trump is the best of the cast for that, and infused with the unholy power of that image with the flag, maybe they think they can pull off another war.This means – if I’m right – that Trump will go full war hog-mode after the election. We’ll see.

                                                    Thanks, Felix, this is coherent and plausible. It does not imply that the attempt was fake in the sense that Trump was in on it, but other than that, it’s plausible.I still think that the simple version I mentioned above is more likely and that the resulting scenario described by you is more likely Plan B. But the details don’t really matter in the big scheme of things.

And yes, your stepped scenario is probably more plausible than mine (which does imply that Trump was in on it, since it involves being fake hit, using a blood squib on his ear and all that.)
Just wanted to get an outside take on the record. I got conned by Trump once, so I’m wary.

There was more, but this is the gist of his talk. I tend to agree with that.Now they are stuck with Plan B.

                                                    I believed Trump was being tagged as the pro-war Judas goat until the assassination attempt, Felix. The attempt almost certainly was orchestrated by a pro-war faction/agency that went rogue. My guess is that insane and ham-handed power move has changed the course of history in that WWIII is off the table now.
Read Frum’s column today. Notice the failure to blame Putin somehow for it. This came from someone who wanted WWIII too much and trusted Trump too little to deliver on it.

If it’s fake, that shoe still fits.
And I figure it could go either way regarding the WW3-thing. That photo makes one hell of a recruitment poster.

If it is Vance, and I say this as no fan, WWIII is definitely off the table. If Youngkin or someone like him, I’m wrong. And if I’m wrong, Trump is a dead man walking even more than he was supposed to be on Saturday.

WWIII is off the table.
Thank God.
And it likely was a rogue agency, CIA likely, that correctly did not trust Trump to deliver WWIII. Trump also will live longer now with someone who is even more anti-war ready to replace him. Maybe I’ll forgive Vance’s coal-burning.

I read the Redneck Manifesto back when it was a thing, but the only thing that tells you is that he’s a liberal – a sanctimonious one at that.Trump probably picked him because he thinks he is easily bullied. I still have the feeling we’re in a movie where the big plot twist is still to come. Trump wouldn’t be the first candidate to run on a pacifist platform only to warmonger on all cylinders once in office.As I said above, if this is scripted, this shooting is the perfect setup for a Pearl Harbor-event.

In addition to the unlikelihood of 341-dimensional chess, the right Neocons and right Tribe are in full meltdown over Vance. They perceive, correctly, the Grand War with Russia is being tossed on the ash heap of history. I wish that same confidence applied to Iran but we’ll see.

Let’s hope you’re right.

                        If you believe that this is a mass lesson in medium manipulation and that Hollywood is helping put this production on, as I do, think Hollywood special effects. Very similar idea, in fact, to the movie “Argo,” using Hollywood to pull this off.

                            How can I prove that you are actually a real person and not an AI or an agent provocateur?Melania Trump could easily be a secret agent for the deposed Iranian Shah, working to secure the rights to K. C. And The Sunshine Band’s back catalogue for the heirs of Jimmy Hendrix. Easily!! Can you disprove this?How do any of us know that J D Vance is not the bastard great great grandson of L. Ron Hubbard, and that his Hillbilly Elegy was ghost written by Fred Reed for the price of 6 chickens and a case of Yuengling?It is very unfortunate that the theories generated by obvious, glaring lies told by the Rulers (9/11, Waco, JFK, et al) have created a class of people who think they are very learned and wise, and who can imagine conspiratorial smoke arising from the most innocuous of ice bergs.Sure. Everything you positcouldbe true. But what actual evidence do you have, other than assertions? What logical fallacies do you bring to the table, similar to Building 7 collapsing when no planes struck it?Nothing? Oh, but itcouldbe true! So could all the examples I provided at the outset.Anythingcouldbe true, but not everything isplausibleby any but the most lurid exaggeration and reckless conjecture.

                    Haha, I am not that much upset about the downvotes. What bothers me is when a downvote is a substitute for a reasonable answer. I elaborated on my question and it only got more downvotes. I see a lot of cognitive dissonance around this event and a some of the theories being floated around seem like poisoning the well to me.

                You don’t think that Trump could have Hollywood on his team and this could be Hollywood special effects? Yes, I know there is hostility around here to Q and I don’t really care if there is or not. All I know is that Eric Trump doesn’t appear on the number one Q show twice if it is something they want to disavow. (Thanksgiving Day 2022 and earlier this year.)

People do all kinds of crazy things in exchange for money. Executioners, porn stars, prostitutes, mercenaries, assassins, public school teachers– the list goes on and on.
David Duke has been interviewd numerous times by mainstream media outlets. Why would Duke do that unless he wholeheartedly agreed with the anchors interviewing him? He must be a secret Zionist!

        I’m fascinated by the fact he was a Registered Republican. The fit would’ve been an Antifa lunatic. Haven’t checked today, but I haven’t seen anything indicating that was the case. Did he leave a manifesto, what were his motivations? The narrative is kind imposing itself on the event.If it gets people off the couch, great, but I’d still like to understand what is going on. The young are different, probably because of their demographic reality. Not even based on race/ethnicity, necessarily. Different influences at the least. It’s obvious to us here that demographics are making politics less ideological, but is that reality breaking through? My friends are doing the standard ‘he’s a lefty, cast him into the void’ bit, because of course no True Republican! would turn. I’m not defending the guy, but it helps to understand the nature of the conflict.

            I read that it’s common for people in his state to register with the party they dislike to vote for the weaker candidate for the primaries which probably explains why he was registered republican. Apparently he also donated money to actblue &amp; he was also a featured extra in a blackrock commercial which has since been pulled.

            I have registered as a voter in various opposition parties in California when I lived there and here in Illinois so that I might help select a weaker candidate to vote against. It’s a common practice. Unfort it means I get spammed by Chuy Garcia soliciting funds on behalf of Biden and the like.

            I’m fascinated by the fact he was a Registered Republican.You give way too credit to other people’s minds. It’s not like he was reading Russell Kirk or George Nash to get a sense of whether he’d have been a Rockefeller Republican or a Nixon Man in ’68, or maybe gone over for LBJ in ’64 based on Goldwater being too extreme, like Trump or something.Almost certainly his comprehension of politics was limited to three to four sentences deep, max. Beyond that, nothing but 2018-2022-high-school-tier opinion and speculation and predictions about the future, which is the most people can muster these days, having had virtually no education and with absolutely no knowledge nor inclination to learn about the past.What do these kids think about? There’s nothing in their heads but emotion.

                But apparently he cared enough to switch registration and attempt a political assassination. Right?

                There are certainly plenty of Republicans who really don’t like Trump. Enough to try to assassinate him? Idk, and I don’t like pondering it, you know?

                    Republicans years ago linked arms with Democrats and marched in serried ranks with them in the effort to neutralize if not destroy Trump. Being a Republican hardly means you’re on the right. In fact, it probably indicates you’re only slightly to the right of the Democrats, which means you could still be to the left of Trotsky.

        I just watched Trump’s kids at the convention together voting Florida’s 125 delegates for Trump. They sure don’t look like people whose dad missed death by a millimeter. Of course, maybe they get their inheritance quicker if Trump gets whacked.
And whatever happened to Don Jr’s beard/rent-a-girlfriend aka Gavin Newsom’s ex-wife?

        This will not change anything. All it will take is one person assaulting a protected group and the assassination attempt will be forgotten.
There will be some basement dwelling loser that will try to take revenge by shooting a low level democrat politician.
Also, the guy was a registered republican so the official narrative will be that this was chickens coming home to roost.
