        The problem with satire is that so few “get it”!

        My mom is from yankeeland (the northeastmost state…) and back in the Selma days she explained the difference between the goodthink and badthink whites to me as “In the north the people love the race but hate the individuals while in the south they love the individual and hate the race.” I was too young to understand what she meant at the time but I have since learned the truth of what she meant.

        Zman’d proposal is almost perfect! But the “natural borders” idea makes so much sense too. I say we annex Cuba, and put all the blacks and the New Englanders there together. Then they can marinate together in there very own socialist Paradise!
All existing Cubans will be allowed to move to either Vermont or Miami, their choice. But if they pick Miami, they must man the south-facing machine gun nests for at least 3 years each. Unlimited ammo, and a small bounty for each waterlogged head.

        The piece may be more satirical than it is satire. Syllogistic?
Idealism increases in direct proportion to one’s distance from the problem. Zman dreams of closing the distance. Put a needy family in the basement of every Yankee home. The old Yankee put his hands on a problem, not a distance.

        Your funny Mr. Z man.That is a great yarn too. You must have a blister on the inside of your cheek from your tongue.
No mater how its sliced, it still depends on welfare from the white world.Break that chain, anything is possible.Personally, I think the whole thing has to burn before anything resembling a remedy is possible. Kind of like the tyranny breathing down our necks. Its remedy through generational movement, our total redue.

Unfortunately Satire only works if it doesn’t sail over the audience’s head.

        This is an intriguing issue. Here in the much smaller UK (and about to get smaller components if the Scots Nationalists ever get their way) we have less land to give to our future problem, the muslims. As Europe takes in more and more non-whites (and hands them passports that allow free passage through any EU border) then they will want to settle in their own areas in — probably –southern England. It could be said we are already giving them big parts of London as well as some northern towns like Rotherham, Bradford and Rochdale and so on but the muslim issue is one of converting all us infidels, so they will want to spill out of their enclaves and spread the good word. Nope, our issue can’t be so easily settled with creating yet more muslim states.I mean, what’s the good of flying the green flag of islam over Downing Street if there are places still in the British Isles that won’t bow down to it?Privately I think what will happen is borders will disintegrate and towns will become fortified strongholds again with their own ways of stopping anyone they don’t want coming through the gates. Soon no one will want to have barbarians inside the gates ever again. we may have to go back to tribes, and that would mean I am with my tribespeople in Elmete or any Brigantes area.I imagine that in the States your traditional boundaries will have to be dissolved if you are setting up areas for black people, in order for them to be truly fulfilled and happy once free of the baleful influence of whites. The old borders and divisions will not do. If these happy places have to protected it would mean natural boundaries, or places where fences can be built easily. One caveat would be that any white person who, in identifying with blacks and their ways, isre free to go there (subject to the laws of the black-ruled societies there, of course) but not free to leave. If so many white people love other races they are free to join them and help them out, but it is a one way ticket.That should make a good few people think twice about how much love of diversity  they have in their hearts.

        This piece is so wrong on so many levels.New England and the Pacific Northwest, as well as California and much of flyover country, are historic Whitopias.  Leave them alone.  On the East Coast, Whitopia extends through Virginia into North Carolina.I say Atlanta, Georgia makes the perfect ground zero for Blacktopia, which would radiate outwards to envelope South Carolina, and Alabama.Displaced whites could make a painless move to Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina for the more civilized, and Louisiana for the more adventurous.  Mississippi would serve as a kind of amorphous border zone, and there might be some blending in southern NC.

            But then Blacktopia would be subject to white racism from bad whites. The only way this can work is to make sure there is separation from the bad whites and protection from good whites.

                Of course.  It won’t be Blacktopia if there are whites there.  Native Whites will have to be pushed out of Blacktopia, much as ethnic Germans were pushed out of Eastern Europe after WWII.  That’s the price you pay for progress.  But I think it will be relatively easy for displaced Whites to settle in the surrounding Whitopian territories.

        You are an evil jester, Zman.Blactopia needs defensible borders. Or perhaps containable is a better word. That leaves…Florida. I’d cut if off at the panhandle though, in the interest of containment. Everything east of Tallahassee and south of Georgia. That leaves every Aferican an acre, if not a mule. And  !5 million non –Afericans to be compensated. I know my son would take 80k for his paid off home in paradise and a bus ticket north, but you have to figure in an average of a quarter million payoff to make people happy, so maybe three trillion for the move-out plus your original two trillion for the move in. Sounds like another stimulous package to me.When the air conditioning stops working it’s not like they really need it, judging by my brother’s wife, who actually hails from the dark continent. And they can live like Jamaicans in all ways, where they may be poor but life is easy. Lotsa natural resources. The mulatto’s can take over ruling the joint like Jamaica too. Nobody seems to object to the natural order of things as long as there are no white people to stir it up.

            Government employees also fret about things like racism and income inequality a lot.

        We already have blacktopias in Detroit, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Chicago.  Starting some more of them in New England would be a hoot. How about in San Francisco and Austin?
Seriously, people already self-segregate.  The problems come in when people move to a different neighborhood, and fail to adopt the reigning ethos, courtesies, and behaviors of the existing community that they moved in to.  And that goes for members of any ethnic group or economic class moving to any new community.
