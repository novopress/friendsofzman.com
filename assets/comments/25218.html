        Drove by the local hospital today.
The ER parking lot was half full at best.
And yet the hoax continues‚Ä¶.

            Every few weeks I stop by the highest prestige local hospital to pick up some equipment my doctor‚Äôs not allowed to have delivered to me. For more than a year and a half now, the place has been post-apocalyptically empty. I have to walk past the emergency entrance to get to the employee door they have me use now, and there are no ambulances outside and nobody waiting inside, ever. Between that door and the room where I make the pick-up, there are two security desks and probably fifty miscellaneous non-patient rooms for testing etc. I always see exactly three people, two guards and the woman who hands me my stuff. I‚Äôve never passed anyone in a hall.The other medical offices I‚Äôve visited during the plague seem only half empty, as you‚Äôd expect when they‚Äôre doing so many phone appointments and ‚Äúdistancing‚Äù everybody else‚Äôs. From what I‚Äôve seen, and from other people‚Äôs pics and film, hospitals are acting very weird/ominous.

        How do you write a Postal money order to Z man without knowing his secret identity?
Me, I‚Äôve always sent him cash, which is obviously risky but less so than other means.

            He also likes XXL shirts that say; ‚ÄúDedham Massachusetts Est. 1636.‚Äù While this is not as much the equivalent of a cup of coffee in Z-Bucks, the man does have an affinity for small beautiful New England towns. Even though he loathes the Yankee invader.

        Somewhat OT, it is interesting how the Regency is just drifting into ‚Äúvaccines forever and ever‚Äù and lockdowns when politically it would have been so easy to let the good times roll, with lots and lots of hand-outs: ‚Äúfree‚Äù electric cars, solar roofs, etc. With no lockdowns and a national party ‚Äúpresided over‚Äù by the Regency. It really is Karens all the way down.Look at NY‚Äôs Kathy Hochul. Cuomo was so loathed and despised all she had to do was just show up and hand out goodies. Instead she‚Äôs choosing a fight with the nurses union there, and other reliable allies ‚Ä¶ for no reason at all. The National Guard as nurses? Yeah right. People who can‚Äôt get access to hospitals for all sorts of things are going to blame her, and its a self inflicted wound.More proof if any needed that Karen Covid Mania is just an unstoppable emotional need. Professional politicians who should know better fall prey to it. Either that or they‚Äôve perfected fraud so highly they don‚Äôt even give a fig leaf of making people not all the time miserable.

            That‚Äôs what is perplexing during this time. Instead of scoring easy points this Biden Administration bumbles from one avoidable disaster to the next one.
Afghanistan withdrawal, Haitians, border patrol shaming, France submarine dismissal, calling Putin a killer in interviews, atrocious handling of China-USA summit in Alaska, VP Harris doing‚Ä¶what, exactly?
This continues but the point remains that Covid is just a bullet point in the list of things great and small that they are screwing up.
More ominous is of this is all part of the plan.

                Assuming the plan is to harm the US as much as possible my thought is that the Afghanistan botch job was a smokescreen to cover the real goal of delivering all kinds of state-of-the-art US military gear to China so they could performance test and reverse engineer all of it, thus giving them an enormous advantage in any conflict with the US.
Degrading US capability prior to a spring campaign against Taiwan would also explain the hysterical desperation to get the US military jabbed before winter.

                Can anyone remember waking up one morning and hearing some good news concerning our current state of affairs? How is it possible? Even something positive by mistake? Good thing the fall to doom is a long way. Newton was wrong. 32 feet per second per second is not the limit. Will we hit terminal velocity before impact?

            Slightly disagree on Hochul.
The WEF bagmen realized she was an even bigger flunatic than Cuomo.
Thus, ol‚Äô Andy was, ‚Äúcleaned up, ‚Äù as they say.
Went by the major local ER today.
There was nothing doing on a lovely autumn afternoon.

                OK, but how is rationing services a win for any politician with ambition? Hochul would like to be something more. She‚Äôd like to be re-elected. At this point, AOC could likely beat her as a Governor candidate. Or Hilaria Baldwin. [Who is Hispanic you know!]‚ÄúVote for me, I prevented your husband from getting admitted to the ER so he died of a heart attack‚Äù is not exactly a winner. Nor is rationing them based on race, or other things. Among other things it creates ‚Äúconspiracies of one‚Äù that being only one, are impossible to detect by surveillance, agents provocateurs, etc. But hey, the emotional high of being the vaccine moralist is just too heavy a drug for her to resist.

            Scratch a Dem pol and you will find a tyrant. Look the Covid scare has given the Dem mayors, governors absolute power over their domain that rivals that found in Communist China. That sir is pure nectar for the low IQ grasping sociopaths that constitute the bulk of the Democratic political ranks.
Besides they absolutely HATE the average citizen including their minorities. I saw that in the anti-gun debates that raged here in CA during the 80‚Äôs. And again when they let their own cities burn during the BLM riots.

        Taking psychedelics, or more specifically, hallucinogens is the equivalent of throwing a monkey wrench into the most sophisticated piece of machinery in the known universe.  It is no surprise Reason is an advocate of them.  I went to a high school were acid was a big drug of abuse, which was a strange thing in the latter 80s,  and had it offered to me many times.  Even as a dumb teenager who was no stranger to trying drugs of abuse, even I understood it wasn‚Äôt a great idea to deliberately just ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the mind, just to see what would happen.   I‚Äôve run into some of those kids as adults and in some cases,  it ain‚Äôt pretty.

            You‚Äôre mostly correct about psychedelics.  There are some guys who have pseudo-mystical experiences on them without downsides, but I suspect these guys are spiritually shallow.
I know two guys whose latent schizophrenia was almost certainly triggered by too much consumption of psychedelics.  They never came back.
I enjoyed them as a young guy but my problem was that 1 in 3 trips descended into harrowing existential horror.  It‚Äôs just not worth it.

                I just recently came across (youtube pushed on me) a YT video pushing LSD and that‚Äôs what got me thinking about it again (LSD was very commonly taken in the high school I went to).  The problem is nobody really understands what‚Äôs going on.  LSD and shrooms are not well understood or studied.  They screw with the psyche, the mind, your inner voice.  They don‚Äôt merely screw with brain chemistry and affect mood, they literally affect your mind to the point that you can be entirely disconnected from yourself and the world.  We know that they can produce effects long after the drug has worn off. How prevalent that may be, I don‚Äôt know, but it can‚Äôt be good. We also know of people who have taken the drug either only once or a very times and never came back from the trip.It just seems to me that the mind/mood distinction is too profound. Taking a drug that enhances your mood in some way just seems to me to be in a whole different category than something that causes you to re-frame a lot of stuff and to hear and see things that are not there. As you say, no doubt people who were already prone to something like schizophrenia could cause the onset or cause to come earlier than it would have.  Bottom line, I‚Äôm glad I passed and would definitely pass today.

            Tars ‚Äì you‚Äôre on to something: John Lennon get heavily into acid in ‚Äò66 after The Beatles stopped touring. In her last book his then-wife Cynthia said he took so much of it he was incommunicado for extended periods. If you look up how he acted in interviews ‚Äò63-‚Äò65, he sharp, acerbic, &amp; witty. By the late ‚Äò60‚Äôs he seemed withdrawn, somewhat surly, &amp; kinda spaced out. His personality completely changed or so it appears.
Can‚Äôt imagine taking that much of a hallucinogenic &amp; not having it affect some sort of lasting effect.

        When I was a young guy I would run into older guys, particularly on the job, where I would say they were stuck in Vietnam.  Then later in life, I started running into guys who never left Iraq.  In both cases, men went off to war, but only shells came home. It was rare that I could really put my finger on exactly what made me think that, or at least any one thing, but it was obvious they weren‚Äôt left with a full deck. Of course, I didn‚Äôt know them before they were shipped off.

        One or two of /ourguys/ in the few comments on that WSJ Ice Age Americas article.  Plus a couple of the usual shallow dipsh*ts, but whatevah.Before History Channel lost its friggin‚Äô mind, I saw a documentary about the white seal hunters who followed the edge of the ice sheet to our east coast some 4000 years before the Siberian waves arrived across the land bridge.  I was sitting next to a full-on wagon burner Indian, big fella, long braids, turquoise &amp; silver, black ten gallon hat.  Probably Paiute.  Poor lad almost lost his stack.The article mentions a possible 30,000 year old human presence in the New World.  I believe we have an older history than we realize, and that our development is molded by evolutionary response to repeated catastrophe.An ignored facet of ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù history are some 3000 pyramids, labyrinths, henges, and dolmens of the megalithic age.  Those were built by /our/ people.What is truly strange is that some of those pyramids still emit focused radiation. The claim is that they moderate weather or earthquakes.  How in hades would that be possible for people who still tied on their moccasin boots with leather strings?  How could they remain active after up to 20,000 years?They‚Äôd do so with no moving parts, as static transformers.  With quartz crystal filled columns in their labyrinthine undertunnels and shaped stone chambers above as channels, they bled off the static electricity building up in the cumulus layer of clouds or in the fissures underground.Their technology was strange to us, but I say they knew something about the electromagnetic layer, the immaterial layer of our dual ecology that we call the ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù.  Much was lost when asteroids struck the ice sheet of North America, ending the Ice Age in the oft-remembered Flood of rapidly rising sea level.  One fragmentary clue is the marvelous acoustics of medieval stone cathedrals.  More clues are the large scale maserotic masonry- inert, degraded in some ways, but still grand- built in the following ages.We were, and are, the builder people.  This is what the barbaric Habiru (Hebrew) refugees, aboriginal Dravidians, (and savage Amerindians, earlier), faced when another recurring period of asteroid strikes hit the Fertile Crescent and Caucasus/Pontic, driving us from our homelands into theirs as told in Genesis.Function determines direction.  The thin shell of the biosphere is trying to achieve another step in its function, and we‚Äôre the step to break through the chrysalis.  We can‚Äôt take the blame or credit for being the Elves, but Elves we are, and must not let ourselves be overwhelmed by‚Ä¶haha, such projection!‚Ä¶‚Äùthe banality of evil‚Äù.  The banality, really, of the brute, unthinking nature of Nature.  Of the combinations that didn‚Äôt quite make the grade.

        Today‚Äôs topic seems to be a potpourri of esoterica, so please allow me to offer up an obtuse insight. The internet blog sport of Normie bashing is strong on this site (and deservedly so); but in my experience, normies really don‚Äôt think of themselves as Normies. Rather, they always seems to think that ‚Äúthe other guy‚Äù is the normie despite holding tight to his/her commitment to voting harder. And they don‚Äôt get the joke when they are the butt of it because they are oblivious to their own mindset. In a form of peak irony, they see themselves as normal and therefore not a Normie.Alright, so where am I going with this. The future freedom fighter will be a highly innovative and effective infiltrator that can get inside, get close, get low, act, and then get the Hell out without drawing attention to themselves. And to do that successfully, you will need a form of social camouflage that allows you to disappear within the herd. And that is no easy task given that mimicking a Normie is repulsive to most DR. In all likelihood, you may need a mental gimmick that enables you to wear the robe of Normie without going nuts in the process. Think of it as getting to play a cameo role on the sitcom The Office for a day. Join the fun, play the role, get in, get out, and leave your mark on history behind; even if no one else knows what just happened.

                It‚Äôs true that Jews mostly game the system solely for their personal or tribal benefit, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm suggesting. At the root, I‚Äôm saying that most DR types are inclined to stand in a firing line and take back this country the old fashioned way, which is noble and manly, but expensive in lives lost. Modeling indicates that the road to success in the modern technological era, and facing a new kind of enemy, is via the backdoor and hitting where in really hurts, and that takes a different mindset and skill set.

            We all do it.  We‚Äôre not all as red-pilled as some other fella. There are conspiratards who think we‚Äôre all sheep falling for the media‚Äôs attempt ‚Äúdivided we fall‚Äù gig and stuck in ‚Äúidentity politics‚Äù whereas they, the smart ones, understand there is a secret cabal of people who orchestrate EVERYTHING behind the scenes. Yet they are dumb enough to leave just enough evidence out there in the open so our super-smart/clever conspiratard can piece it all together into a coherent narrative.The lack of self-awareness is not confined to the ‚Äúnormie‚Äù and conspiratard, it infects us too.  We all have our blind spots. We all don‚Äôt have access to accurate information.  We are completely in the dark in many respects.Our enemy‚Äôs single biggest weapon is disinformation and propaganda.  They are VERY good at it.  This means we are all forced, even those of us who are aware of it, to try and figure out who is doing what and for what reason. Our knowledge, even if correct, is incomplete and we have no real way of knowing what is correct or wrong or what is only complete and what is just outright fabrication.When I read the news, the only thing I can truly be sure of is that the news piece is designed to mislead me in some way.  That is a total mind-f***.It‚Äôs not just politics.  Millions of people believe we are about to have a hyper-loop spiriting us across the lands at 700mph in a vacuum tube. That is entirely because of media propaganda.  Or they believe ICE cars are going to be outlawed in 10 years or less. Or that we are on the cusp of building a city on Mars.   Just look at that crazy Elizabeth Holmes. Her entire scam could not have happened without the L√ºgenpresse‚Äôs propaganda machine. A lot of these major new websites have ‚Äúarticles‚Äù that are nothing more than a paid advertisement designed to fool readers into believing they are reading a piece of journalism.Journalism is WAY too large. There are WAY too many people trying to make a living writing articles on the internet. Not only are they ideological leftists pushing propaganda, but because the industry is so over bloated, none of them are making money. This essentially turned them into mouthpieces of corporations and NGOs and the state.

            Thanks, that helps.  A lot. I‚Äôm having a hard time keeping my yap shut, being Cassandra and all.I can‚Äôt possibly scorn Normie.  That‚Äôs cheap points, and why would he care about whatever bug is up my ***, anyways?Reading Selco on how people change into something truly evil even for the most mundane transactions gives me great pause.  Fantasies of blowing it all up and then grabbing the bugout bag for escape and evasion in the woods is no guarantee of ruling the ruins.So true that enjoying today in this miraculous age is a fine waste of time because the alternative is terrifying.  Gods help us if we get what we think we want.  4S and planting trees worked for them, I‚Äôd do what I can to switch that around.  Playing catch-up is so frustrating.

            Sort of. The thing what looks like the iron fist of the Imperial Capitol is highly dependent on a super inflated stock market, and steady supply of cheap food and utilities. IOW a relatively passive and lethargic population. Really that its the only way you can maintain control of a population when you are outnumbered 10,000 to 1..Bread and circus.That said what you are proposing is what Chairmen Mao wrote in one of his tracts about the saboteur hiding among the population. The same with those who resisted the Nazis in Europe during WWII. It works and is too costly for the other side to deal with. And mind you the Nazis had the sort of manpower and competency our woke masters can only dream of.

        As a Subscribestar paying member, I don‚Äôt know how I missed this one. Yes, maybe I do know how I missed this one. I like to listen to this when I‚Äôm doing projects, so I try and listen on my Android phone. To do this I let my Lastpass log me in and autofill in the credentials and then I have to further put in a 4 digit code that is emailed to my Proton account. When I go to my email to get the code Subscriber star disappears. I am in an endless loop. Largely I listen from my PC until I can figure how to have both windows open at the same time. I‚Äôm sure it is possible, I‚Äôm just getting more and more lazy when it comes to doing technical configurations.If you have read all that crap, and as an aside, I‚Äôve done well per a Bonner recommendation on buying in the energy sector. I saw this on CNBC this am and I‚Äôm figuring they are seconding Bonners recommendation and I will buy more. ‚Äú‚ÄúOil prices have disconnected from the marginal cost of supply. Instead, they are travelling to the level where demand destruction kicks in, which we estimate at ~$80/bbl.‚Äù That‚Äôs what Morgan Stanley wrote in June, and in a note Tuesday, the bank wrote: ‚ÄúThis remains our thesis.‚Äù ‚Äú

After Tuesday‚Äôs bond rate tantrum the Dollar Index (DXY) now stands at 94.32.
The market price of silver is down to 21.58 and gold is down to 1729.

With reports of child rape in one refugee camp in Wisconsin and a possible gang rape of a female soldier at another, this displays how inherently evil our current ruling class truly is.

                    Along those lines, I was out shooting the breeze at a bar a few weeks ago, and wound up in a conversation with a fellow in his late 30s/early 40s.
He was trying to catch up with a woman via text, so the conversation turned towards that topic.
Eventually, he revealed that among his circle of friends it was essentially a given that the ladies had or were making the rounds among the guys.
Not sure how common this is today. The guy seemed fairly normal for the most part.

        I haven‚Äôt listened to the podcast yet, but as someone who grew up less than 4 miles from the national cathedral, I am not at all surprised to see that the religion of leftism has moved on to the stained glass phase. I was looking at the  Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, and of course he‚Äôs from yale and has like been awarded a chivalric title or some such in England, so naturally he‚Äôs gonna want to appease baal and what not. But this can get really awkward for the left, the more they pretend to be a form of Christianity, cause actual Christians still exist and the Bible is there to be read and compared with their bizarre doctrines.

            It‚Äôs also not all that surprising that a ‚Äúchurch‚Äù (more like a memorial) with no set dogmas of any sort could be coopted by zealots of a different sort.  It‚Äôs like in China where it‚Äôs mandated that all churches are arms of The State, but like much else they do it here voluntarily.

                I visited WNC back in 1984 and really enjoyed the experience. I took several photos of the structure and of several stained glass windows with my Nikon FG and tripod. I‚Äôm not emotionally involved with The Lost Cause, but the Generals of the Confederacy are part of American history, among other events depicted on those windows. I left there touched by the feeling that I had visited America‚Äôs Church, even if it was officially Episcopalian. Well, once again the Evil Twins of PC and AA have struck; I should have seen this coming. Yet I have an 8 x 10 blow-up of the ‚Äúspace window‚Äù that I had framed, as well as other interior and exterior shots. Oh, well: I still have happy if fading memories of National Cathedral‚Äìand of America.

            Back in 2000 I went to a Sunday service on the Cornell campus, and that day the visiting minister was the dean of the Yale Divinity School.  Everything you‚Äôve ever suspected about the moral relativism of the elite left was on display in his sermon.  Honestly, the worst stereotype of post-modern Protestantism wouldn‚Äôt do justice to the words coming out of his mouth.  His message was, in sum, ‚Äúin a changing world, what‚Äôs right and wrong is always open to interpretation, but you people can sleep at night because elites like myself stand sentry at the cultural doors and will each day reveal to you the new truth.‚ÄùI was in the early days of getting red-pilled and still retained vestiges of atheism, so I should probably thank him.  That hour in the chapel provided a very valuable lesson in how evil manifests itself in our world.  Without evil, there can be no divinity.  In a way, he provided proof of God‚Äôs existence.

                Probably one of the best comments I have read on any of his threads. FYI: there was a Livestream involving Edward Dutton, Richard Spencer and Devon Tracey (of Atheism is Unstoppable fame), you can still find it on YOUTUBE I believe. The topic was religion as a social utility. Quite interesting but also disappointing at the same time.

            I‚Äôm guessing most of us have seen NYS governor Kathy Hochul‚Äôs bizarre sermon from this past weekend, but if you haven‚Äôt here is yet another Cloudy taking a stab at the deep theological issues facing us in 2021:We are not through this pandemic. I wished we were but I prayed a lot to God during this time and you know what ‚Äì God did answer our prayers. He made the smartest men and women, the scientists, the doctors, the researchers ‚Äì he made them come up with a vaccine. That is from God to us and we must say, thank you, God. Thank you.  And I wear my ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô necklace all the time to say I‚Äôm vaccinated. All of you, yes, I know you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre the smart ones, but you know there‚Äôs people out there who aren‚Äôt listening to God and what God wants. You know who they are.I need you to be my apostles. I need you to go out and talk about it and say, we owe this to each other. We love each other. Jesus taught us to love one another and how do you show that love but to care about each other enough to say, please get the vaccine because I love you and I want you to live.I didn‚Äôt see anything in her sermon where she explained the process by which ‚Äúthe smartest men and women, the scientists, the doctors, the researchers‚ÄùcreatedCovid in the first place!  What, was her god just not paying attention at that moment?Jokes aside, this kind of religious justification for drawing a boundary between vaxxed and unvaxxed cannot end well.  It‚Äôs essentially sanctioning violence against the hold outs.  It‚Äôs what God wants, right?

                The general rule in academia is: if you want to find out what a given egghead really, truly hates, all you have to do is look at xzheyr field of study. Academic historians loathe the past, which is why academic history is now nothing more than an endless quest to find everyone and everything from before The Current Year lacking by The Current Year‚Äôs standards. Professors of English Literature loathe the very idea of literature, which is why their writing is the ugliest, most obtuse, neologism-filled gobbledygook you‚Äôll ever find. ___ Studies are just self-loathing dressed up as hatred of Normie, and so on. Thus, ‚Äúdivinity school‚Äù people are all Satanists, de facto if not de jure.

            From the git go there were all manner of Christianities.  The torah based church in Jerusalem lead by brothers James and Jude.  The most popular church and creators of the first new testament were the Marcionites who reject the evil yaw way.  Gnostic.  Pauline.   Those that became Catholics.  The Arians were popular.From Martin Luther through now, there‚Äôs been an explosion sects.  Unitarians, Universalists, Zio rapturists,  Christian Identity,  Whatever-ists.Personally, I think the Marcionite approach would have been better utilize  Paul‚Äôs Christology, lighten up on the old testament stuff.I‚Äôd go further, utilize  Dyeus Ph‚Äôter  who is Our European Heavenly Father, and then add on a Jesus like dying and rising Son. And a daughter too.Julius Caesar was killed, and I‚Äôm sure he is coming back.    Soon.

                    Ah shucks.  I‚Äôm not being facetious here, Christians, and no offense meant.This is how the New Testament and early Christianity was developed.  I want a Christ Militant to the Judeo-Wokism that all the Third World is copying.  We forget that China is copying and adapting what they learned from us and our small-hatted hangers-on.I ain‚Äôt fooled by the faux atheism of the Bolshevik Soviet or aggressively sneering Judeo-Atheist fronts like ‚ÄúAmerican Atheist.org‚Äù, Skeptic Society, or that James Randi bozo.Status snobbery by these types is poor gruel as well as obnoxious.  I want something meaty to satisfy the social-emotional goals of the traditional religious.Agnostic atheism doesn‚Äôt answer the questions *they* are asking in a way that works for them, and Judeo-atheism is actively hostile.  Christianity has proven that it works quite well enough for people at that practical level.It‚Äôs strong enough to even uplift Africans!  I would certainly like to bring it up to our century, just as the Niceans brought it up to theirs.

                        I think we are on similar paths.  There is a lot of good stuff in the Judastan testaments.  And it also has ways it leads our people astray.
Having our religion based upon a foreign people as heroes: Not Good, it leads to fetishing foreigners.    Hurray for the mythical mad man Moses massacring Midianites.  Yaw way akbar!
I agree too that the snarky atheist are annoying, even icky.
We want and need religion.  A Christianity that keeps the good parts, and leaves out the judey parts, homes the Christ upon Europeans people.

                        Yup.  We are of like mind.
I found out that (((Harry Hopkins))) was in charge of the Lend-Lease to Stalin.  Stalin and his Bolshie administrators paid nothing.  Hitler would‚Äôve won.
Also, 50,000 of the first convicts sent to Australia were Irish rebels.  Their uprising began as they saw a wounded Britain defeated in the American Revolution.
