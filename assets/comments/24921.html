        The quest for meaning can be satisfied easily for a woman: have a baby. Studies have shown that women‚Äôs work-drives drop dramatically after they have their children. They transfer their needs into the child‚Äôs achievements.
For a man, it is not so simple. He needs actual achievements. The ‚Äúmid-life crisis‚Äù where you buy a cool sportscar is an attempt to buy himself some coolness, which substitutes as meaning.
Either way, male or female, the real whammy starts by the Age Thirties.

            Meaning can only be found in truth, then in God. Liberalism puts all ‚Äúmeanings‚Äù on the same level. Thats the modern crisis

                The last part is spot on. For most people deep meaning is a luxury good  if they have cognitive capacity enough to want it that is.
A simple  ‚ÄúI am a member of my society and this is what is expected of me‚Äù is all they need but our society doesn‚Äôt have that.

            absolutely wrong, for a man fathering a baby instantly gives you a new purpose and priority. or at least it should .  and if you are fortunate , then you may get grandchildren too. My kids and grandkids mean as much to me as they do to my wife.

If taking care of, providing for and protecting your kids and wife doesn‚Äôt give a man purpose, I‚Äôm not sure what would.

            By nature,
Women want love, the love of a man and children and family.
Men want to be respected. The respect and admiration of a woman, his family, and friends.
A man wants to be strong and able to provide for, support and protect his family.
A woman wants to be attractive and lovable.
Men lift weights, buy ammo, and watch Rambo movies.
Women buy cosmetics, pretty dresses, and read Sense and sensibility.

        We are rudderless because sound minded Americans don‚Äôt want to consider self rule or authority and instead depend on other to do what they must do themselves.If we to end  this mess and are willing to pay the price which is questionable, to get started get a win plan.The Taliban did. When we win we  become the State and impose Sharia. It was a solid plan with clear goals and it was successful. Pretty good for supposedly 85 IQ goat herders.If when our side comes up with one or more win plans, than they  can get started.And note restoring real America is not a plan. That only barely worked when it was a moral and religious White nation and only White male landowners  could vote.It died in less than a century.And no on is ever left alone. Ever. Even if you are dead we are dealing with people that will slander you memory or dig up your grave and defile your corpse.You want out? Make something that works start with ‚ÄúAnything that makes it hard to start a family , stay married and have kids gets curb stomped.‚Äù

        In Los Angeles the bag boys at the grocery store wear shirts that say ( proud to be an essential worker) on the back of them. It‚Äôs truly sickening. It‚Äôs almost enough to get me to hire a greasy jogger with purple gums and blonde hair to deliver moldy bread and bruised fruits and vegetables to the front door. FYI when I‚Äôm at the grocery store these days, it‚Äôs 70% instacart food slaves wandering the isles looking for truffle oil. We used to run into our neighbors while shopping. Not anymore.

            Stopped by one store this morning that I don‚Äôt frequent that often.  Sign ‚Äòstrongly encouraged‚Äô masks for ‚Äòour guests.‚Äô  I‚Äôm not a damned guest, I‚Äôm a customer.  We‚Äôre not talking friendship but a mere commercial transaction.  I‚Äôm so enraged by the presumption of intimacy by everyone.  And guest/ host implies I have an obligation to comport with their standards, instead of customer/seller where they have an implied obligation to appeal to my wants and needs.  The commercial pretending to be the personal has invaded every aspect of life,  and I want to kill it with fire.

                I hate that presumption of familiarity.  Last week the FDA put out a tweet pertaining to Ivermectin that said ‚ÄúYou are not a horse.  You are not a cow.  Seriously, y‚Äôall.  Just stop it.‚Äù
I can feel my jaw clench when I encounter that sort of unprofessionalism.  I blame much of it on parents who have spent the last 20 years calling their kids ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù or ‚Äúdude‚Äù.

                Was in a Farm and Fleet of all places, and an honest to God, real life Karen informed me (while way back in the store), that I needed to have a mask on. I said ‚Äúok‚Äù and continued my shopping. Everyone was masked up and no one else said a word.Ignore them.If they persist, leave.

        Gk Chesterton covered this to an extent in ‚Äúorthodoxy‚Äù although it‚Äôs been a hike since I read it. If God were to be asked what the major problem on earth would be, He would say, sin.
But then people would have to start changing their lives and that‚Äôs hard.

            I first read ‚ÄúOrthodoxy‚Äù 5-6 years ago. Its a great book, I need to read more Chesterton. At the time I was shocked by how relevant it was to the contemporary world I was growing up in. The creeping Bolshevism in the culture and all the social ills of the early 1900s had a  nearly 1:1 modern equivalent.
Of course his writing is top notch as well. He is a master of the pithy phrase or one liner.  There is a gem on nearly every page.

        ‚ÄúOnce those challenges were conquered, there was no need for the sort of men who rush to the sound of danger.‚ÄúThis is actually why I had no problem with those Congressmen going to one of the ‚ÄòStans to try an lease helicopters to get Americans out of Kabul.  Sure, it was a bit reckless, but we don‚Äôt have enough of that.Instead, we get told it‚Äôs not their ‚Äúplace‚Äù and that it should be left to the same professionals who so utterly botched the simple job of flying Americans out of the country that their only recourse has been to shamelessly lie about what they did.  How many people can claim that they knew about a terror attack timing, location, and method 24-48 hours ahead of time, yet STILL manage to let it happen and kill 200 people and 13 US Marines.  That‚Äôs a level of stupid that far exceeds anything those Congressmen did.

As far as America‚Äôs this or that moment, people can pick and choose.  The decline began long ago, even if the oncoming fall is only just becoming apparent to many.

            This anecdote is why I added focus to my 4S dictum. If you don‚Äôt focus on the root of the problem, you will forever be spinning your wheels chasing the side-effects of our societal cancer. The latter is known as palliative care, which is just a humane way to die with minimum pain.

            The only way to prevent such an attack would be to bar all Afghans from entering the airport area, and to shoot any that tried to come in anyway.
Since the orders to our Marines were to pack as many Afghans as possible that would fit into a plane and bring them to the USA so they can rape and kill Americans, collect welfare and vote Democrat for the rest of their lives, the attack could not be prevented.

            Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma decided to play Rambo and went over to personally rescue people. These pointless and foolish acts are driven by a need to be seen as men with a purpose beyond the role they play.
What‚Äôs more pointless and foolish than the POW-MIA flag? Those servicemen, many of whom were draftees, are indeed forgotten and even if you knew the exact location of one of them it would be against federal law for you to engineer their release and repatriation.

        being a socal native, hedonism is something i know a little about.  if you visit cali you might get a teeny sense of how amazing the climate is near the coast (go 25 miles inland and the story changes).  the light really is golden, and the sun kissing your skin is pure bliss.   but.  like the sweet liquid in a Venus Flytrap, it is a lure.  it makes people like the Greek story/myth of the land of the lotus eaters.  they rot away lying in the sun.a few years ago i read a small essay about the difference between happiness and pleasure, and how people that confuse the two are harming themselves.  here it is:https://www.cram.com/essay/What-Is-The-Difference-Between-Happiness-And/P34QFRSZ7BWQthe reason pleasure is a kind of trap is that if the brain experiences pleasure because of some activity, it will learn to seek that activity out.  more than anything else, humans are pleasure machines (see what i did there?).  why is that? well, what is the role of pleasure in a human (or any animal)?  it is a reward for performing desired activities.  desired by whom?  the great maker of course.did you know there is a part of the brain called the pleasure center?  when you eat, you feel pleasure.  when you have sex, you feel pleasure.  when you do things to help your family, you feel pleasure.  see where this is going?  in a state of nature, there are few sources of pleasure, outside of internally generated kind.  but there are some.  animals will seek out fermented fruit.  why?  cause it has alcohol in it.  animals will also seek out plants like jimson weed, to get high on.this is why lesbians and feminists (but i repeat myself) are so unhappy ‚Äì they never do the things the maker wants them to, so they get no pleasure.here‚Äôs the really interesting thing; the capacity for pleasure, like every other attribute of life, varies between individuals.   imagine one person who can‚Äôt even enjoy the finest steak, while another person can get immense pleasure from an apple.  think that first person isn‚Äôt going to be envious of the second person?chasing pleasure is like Icarus trying to fly to the sun; the more you experience artificial pleasure, the weaker your response, and the higher the intensity has to be to get you there.  eventually you flame out and are wrecked.

            Karl, as you aptly note, the mind can not stand a constant input of stimulus, hence it attenuates.

        Zman said: ‚ÄúLike all living things, humans are wired to do what is necessary to reach sexual maturity.‚Äù I would state it a bit more explicitly: From Nature‚Äôs point of view, an organism becomes useless, indeed a liability, the second that its descendants are the ones that reached maturity (can live without requiring the parent‚Äôs support.)Of course, with humans it is more complex than that. Older people past child bearing age, whether biological parents or not, can and do contribute to the family or the tribe in many ways. But they also become a burden at some point. Some organisms are a net burden their entire lives. How to deal with the deadwood is an open-ended problem, unhappy to contemplate. üôÅ

        Speaking as one who was a near-lifelong resident of Virginia, the ‚Äúpardon‚Äù was somewhat of a surprise. Not in the least, was that I was unaware that rape could get the death penalty in the old days. I don‚Äôt think anyone denies that Virginia was Jim Crow in 1949 or that Negroes got the worst of it back then. But the US military was as harsh: in that era, solders too were executed for rape, to include the father of famous Civil Rights ‚Äúmartyr‚Äù Emmett Till. Harsh though the death sentence was, I do not see any claims that the defendants were innocent of the charge(s). (But to be fair, I didn‚Äôt look.)If naught else, this latest news item, as well as recent abolition of the death penalty and legalization of marijuana, show how much Virginia has changed in 70 years. A lot of this, of course, was driven by the cancerous growth of the Federal government of which Virginia ‚Äúbenefited‚Äù due to proximity to Tubman DF.  üôÅOf course, Virginia‚Äôs current regime is no more representative of the average resident, any more than that of DC represents the country. Keep those stout trees and lamp posts clear, boys, we may need them yet.

                When I think of how the Russians treated the Germans after WWII, I‚Äôm reminded of the saying ‚ÄúIt is good war is so terrible, lest we become too fond of it‚Äù.
Cured the German of war fever, anyway.
US war adventures will continue until we are on the terrible end of it. Something the US mainland has never truly seen.

            At common law, all felonies were punishable by death.  Rape has always been a felony in the Western tradition.  The erosion of the death penalty by the black-robed shaken isba tragedy ‚Äì first barring it for rape back in the 70‚Äôs I think, and then I think it was the 90‚Äôs they decided death penalty for raping children was ‚Äúcruel and unusual‚Äù and thus unconstitutional.

                        Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do like Styx, but it‚Äôs because I get a kick out of them. I like Falco and Slipknot for the same reason, and Primus might be my favorite band.
What tripped me up about Styx was seeing Dennis DeYoung on VH1 back in college. He seemed so earnest about it. Idk, it‚Äôs complicated?

                    I disagree.  I‚Äôm a Journey man myself, but those were bands that actually had skill sets. It was mostly the effete snobbery of the Rolling Stone types that gave them a bad rap; an early example of the coastal elites pissing on flyover country.

        I‚Äôd call this another case of Hitler‚Äôs revenge, Chapter CXVIIIAmericans didn‚Äôt become obsessed with making the trivial into the epic until Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers came out in the late nineties and early 2000‚Äôs. While the violence portrayed was realistic, everything World War II related became elevated to CRUSADE status which Bush and the neocons exploited mercilessly when it came time to send the troops over to the Afghan and Iraqi wastelands.It has spiraled downwards and dumbwards from there. People know deep down that the country is spiritually empty and not worth getting a leg blown off projecting power in some Third World should hold. Yet, as our host points out, people WANT a crusade. And once one government manipulation winds up (War on Terror), by God will sign up for the next one (War on Covid).In all likelihood, it will probably continue to spiral down until finally a group coalesces around the last few things worth fighting for like family, farm and faith.I imagine this will happen quicker than any of us suspect.

                    I recall ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù as a pretty good movie. However, the plot, as I recall it, was that the Army committed resources to rescue from the risk of a combat death, said Ryan, a sole surviving son. While high drama and a good emotional tug, I find it very hard to believe that in wartime, the military would risk major resources, including multiple lives, solely for such a reason.

                        Paul Fussell, a Battle of the Bulge veteran, said that the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan should have been spliced out as a separate film and shown to every high school male senior under the title ‚ÄúOmaha Beach: Aren‚Äôt You Glad You Weren‚Äôt There?‚Äù.
The rest of the film he thought was on the level of a sub par John Ford Western.

                        Ben, the story line in Ryan was a bit imagined, but the occurrence of an entire family line perishing was not.  The Sullivan brothers all being killed early in WWII was a major blow to the country‚Äôs morale.  The military changed their deployment policy such that relatives did not serve together as closely as the Sullivan‚Äôs were allowed and were more inclined to deferments for only sons and such.

        I tried earlier but comment in moderation.  In brief, though it‚Äôs been used before, the Age of Anxiety suits these times very well.  When American adventurism peaked and crested at the Pacific rim [with a brief resurgence in space], the tsunami rolled back leaving us searching for purpose.  When the everyday event is enshrined, even the trash collector is a hero.  Anxiety springs from the inner knowledge that we are merely jousting at windmills.Modern HeroesBereft of lyric Homer VoiceFolly to Rime heroic VerseYet a troubled Heart leaves no ChoiceBut Speak Thoughts in Mind well-rehearsed.The Age of Heroes, its Race runOn Trojan Plains, in Labyrinth StrandsAchilles‚Äô Games where Honor won;Minotaur felled at Theseus‚Äô Hands.What can compare, O modern ManWhose Knights of the Keyboard en masseVainglorious on Twitter Stand,Victorious o‚Äôer naught but dross?No monsters walk abroad, for they all have been slain;Yet vicious are the ones, in virtual domain.

                    Though I still haven‚Äôt read the whole thing, in whitey on the moon by Paul Kersey, he documents how Congress and the bureaucrats turned it into a welfare program for credentialed diversity and wammen.But, you still have to take into consideration what NASA‚Äôs real mission actually was, which was to perfect ICBMs. By the time of the Moon Landing, they pretty much knew what they wanted to learn.Actually having colonies on other worlds just isn‚Äôt feasible any time soon.The amount of money they spent on NASA in the 60s (among other things like Vietnam and medicare/medicaid), caused the stagflation of the 70s and 80s. We have not since recovered. We have been de-industrializing ever since.

        In years gone by, the quest for meaning (at least for normal people) would typically involve doing your job to the best of your ability, or raising a fine family, or just being a normal, decent human being and community member.  Not any more.  Now it‚Äôs all about the ‚Äúgood feels‚Äù to be had on social media, the curse of the planet.  It‚Äôs all just so superficially pathetic.  Kudos from your real flesh &amp; blood friends, family or co-workers simply aren‚Äôt enough these days.  It all has to be blasted out to the world in order to get that REAL feeling of accomplishment.

            Bingo. This has always struck me as bizarre; that so many people hanker after the attentions and adulation of others. Seems very odd to me, but perhaps there have always been this many crazies and social media has just blown the lid off.Either way, earning your keep, taking an interest in stuff, building family and extended networks based on actual values ‚Äì not mass movements ‚Äì seems the way to go.In fact, for the DR, so practical sloganeering could really appeal to normie‚Äôs want to start a family. That‚Äôs what we could in fact offer, and that is one key drum to beat. Want affordable family formation? Want a society that doesn‚Äôt think your lilly-white kid has some unearned privilege? Want to simply hang out with the like-minded and do family stuff?I haven‚Äôt looked at the demographics for a long time, but I have noticed that many wokeists don‚Äôt have or want kids. That is something I am keen to support. Gotta keeps these wretches away from mine own seede though.

            UsNthem:  Yes, that desperate need for constant attention and affirmation.  Cue all the Hollywood denizens posting about their spawn and their causes, the dindus flaunting their latest White kill, the dinduettes claiming credit for hair braids, hoop earrings, and shaking their steatopygia.  It just does not compute for me ‚Äì even when I watch videos of a presumably decent White family learning to homestead, I cannot conceive of exposing and monetizing my own private life the same way.

            No, nowadays validating one‚Äôs purpose in life requires such socially useful actions as dredging for dirt, no matter how trivial, so that you can get a game show host fired. Dislike someone? If you dig enough, he‚Äôs BOUND to have once told a dirty joke or said something sexist. If it‚Äôs really important, like an alleged sexual assault from 40 years ago, just make up some shit. After all, you‚Äôre a helpless victim! They‚Äôll believe you.Or for the second and third tier activist, how about getting a bird renamed? After all, a black birder might take offense at one named for an obscure Confederate general. Or how about a boulder on a university campus? Apparently someone used a now-out-of-favor epithet for it a century ago. So that rock must go! Or, if you‚Äôre late to the show, just throw a brick through a window, beat somebody up, or set a store on fire, to show that you‚Äôre down with the cause!

        Perhaps the overarching theme for which this age will be remembered is the Great Crusade for Egalitarianism and Equity: The final overthrow of hierarchy of every kind, in the instantiation of the insistence that ‚ÄòEveryone is alike and equal in every respect!‚Äô Whereas our evil ancestors made distinctions among the various groups of people, today‚Äôs Anti-Racist Egalitarians are engaged in the righteous struggle to make sure all our institutions and beliefs reflect the fact of Perfect Equality For All. Groups like Blacks who have long been denied equality now become our Sacred Symbols, and are exalted to the degree they once were oppressed and ignored. All Egalitarian Warriors can bask in the glow of smug self-righteousness which comes from knowing that they‚Äôre taking part in a Holiest of All Crusades: the crusade to erase all distinctions.

                    The entire point of jabports is to prod the productive class into a China-style social credit system and central bank digital currencies with built-in expiration dates and taxation.
Obviously, the expiration dates, rates, and available spending categories will all be managed via social credit score.
There will probably also be a health score component based on jab records, BMI, exercise frequency and intensity.

        Everyone is the hero of their favorite dream. I think it may be in the DNA. In olden times, this was a largely personal reverie, but in the age of the internet, everyone can manufacture their 15 minutes of fame if they know how to work a cell phone camera. Fight videos are now epidemic online and OnlyFans has elevated depravity into an art form. It‚Äôs all part of the accelerating vortex of the toilet bowl we are descending into.So, what to do? First, step out of the sewage pit, wash yourself off, and get the Hell as far away from it as in humanly possible in your personal circumstances. Then, tune out of all mass media and learn to survive on your wits &amp; labor. Your goal should be sore muscles at the end of the day, most days. Do that and your head will clear, your humility will return, food will taste better, and you WILL sleep through the night.Stop trying to solve the world‚Äôs problems and focus on healing yourself. Most folks are walking wrecks but don‚Äôt know it because of affluence addiction and the firehose of media saturation. It‚Äôs either fight-die or flee to a safer &amp; healthy haven.Oh, and the real hero part come later.

                i shitpost like a champion :).  i especially like to go on xhamster and critique sex videos.  sometimes i go on realtor.com and send shitposts to realtors about the crappy home they are pushing. or i put in an offer for half the asking price.  so far i have refrained from going on lefty sites, as it‚Äôs no fun picking on retards.

                In theory, your advice may have an incremental impact at the margins of society, but you will be competing against the Big Boys, who have weaponized mass media for decades now and are masters at the game of indoctrination. And all of this is largely closing the door after the horse has run off. The prime time to indoctrinate is during the formative years of early childhood development, and Progs own the public schools, TV cartoon networks, and even children‚Äôs books now. I submit that you‚Äôre dancing in the feces with the other muckrakers and don‚Äôt realize the contamination it‚Äôs doing to you too.Change will come, it will happen very fast, and it will follow in the wake of collapse. Nothing motivates people like having no choice but to adapt or die.If you want to perish in the melee pit of collapse &amp; chaos, that is your choice. But there is a seed vault in Svalbard Norway that is intended to help restart humanity in the event of a planet-wide catastrophe. You can do something similar with people too. But the point of most post is simpler. You have complete control over yourself, and it‚Äôs a conceit to presume you‚Äôre going to change the world with some snarky criticism.

Then why are they panicking,  burning their own online platforms to slow down our triumphal online campaign? Because if not for systematic censorship, the dissident right would own Youtube by now.
Ten years ago, almost all major MSM outlets had comment sections on most articles, because they trusted the indoctrination. Boy, were they wrong!

        I think the idea that we are experiencing a spiritual exhaustion is exactly right. This exhaustion is not merely one we see among the irreligious: I know lots of church-going bugmen for whom the big weekly celebration of God and the bi-weekly small group meetings are not working.They keep looking. Maybe the thing where the men‚Äôs group funds a trip to Ethiopia to dig a well in some godforsaken village somewhere will do the trick. But an Evangelical whose older son is busy in the Big City and whose younger son just came out as gay is going to wonder what, exactly, was the point of humiliating himself for decades in globohomocorp so he could become the Director of Southeast Regional Marketing.It‚Äôs a good question.

            And the Ethiopians think, what is this white man doing here and why did he dig a giant hole in the ground?
Then a week later, the hole in the ground is full of feces, goats, and dead bodies. The white man, safely back at Metro Atlanta MegaChurch can virtue signal about how he provided Ethiopians some clean water.

                The copper pipes were dug up and sold for scrap. The pump and any other hardware was sold on the black market for what it would fetch. Meanwhile, the women carry water from the nearest well, a few miles away, just as they have for decades. They scrounge further afield for firewood. It never occurs to anyone to ask where all the trees have gone, nor why only barren ground remains.

            I think the idea that we are experiencing a spiritual exhaustion is exactly right.
I see what you mean, but I haven‚Äôt experienced that myself, on the contrary: becoming a white nationalist was invigorating, it gave me a clear lodestar.
I don‚Äôt understand it when people lament that we don‚Äôt have visions, nothing positive to offer young people; I find it almost offensive: is saving your people from genocide not noble or elevated enough?

                Good shout, Felix. Protecting and saving your heritage and people is probably ‚Äì spiritually, at least ‚Äì the highest thing a man can do.
Just a shame that what we offer is hard work, and not obviously materialistic. Why worry about old dead great-great grandpa ‚Äì he was probably a why ‚Äòspremacisss anyway ‚Äì when I can just keep upgrading my iPhone.
That said, many people of my acquaintance are realising things are broken. And that the solution typically is local in fashion. With family and extended clan coming first.

                I agree Felix.  I guess that I am too skeptical to be traditionally religious, but I find meaning in preserving and extending the white race.
If I had to adopt a religion, I would do what I‚Äôm told the Japanese do:  worship my ancestors.
Worship them not necessarily because they were the best but because they survived and they are mine.

            It is always just assumed that an ‚Äúall white jury‚Äù was just out for racial blood and not at all interested in finding the right party.Of course, the opposite is NEVER considered. When a black jury TODAY exonerates a black from murdering or raping a white, oh that‚Äôs never because of racial solidarity or when a black jury convicts a white man.It‚Äôs all sickening.

        Zman seems to be hinting at a transhumanist future in his final paragraph. Our Tech Lords very much desire that future and believe that they can bring it about. I would call our current time ‚Äúthe age of universal narcissism.‚Äù The widespread narcissism makes people easier to control and, given advancements in technological surveillance and AI, may well lead to the end of our species as we have known it (at least in The West ‚Äî which has become the focal point of the totalitarian drive toward a mechanistic neo-feudalism).

                I too believe that the Cloud People will ultimately fail in their technocratic schemes; my fear is that they will destroy potentially billions of lives in the process of bringing disaster upon their own heads. What you‚Äôre talking about is a ‚Äúremnant‚Äù ‚Äî a group that survives the mass carnage. You speculate that some may go crazy and/or off themselves when they find out it was all a stupendously propagandized hoax. You might be right about that. My faith is that there will be other survivors who emerge with a renewed sense of humanity and the necessity of genuine freedom.

I tend to agree.
Their current project really has the stench of the Tower of Babel about it.
The supply chains are so effed that the MIC is unable to get critical electronic components.
A bunch of guys with nothing more than dirty rags, rusty AKs, and well-worn prayer rugs just sent the most powerful military on the planet home with its F-15s, nukes, and its tail between its legs.

                        Yup.
The smart grid is about controlling the electrical power to your home.
That will be tied to your jabport and social credit score.
Same goes for electric cars.
They will control where you go, when you go, what route is taken, and the speed you get there.
No travel for those with low social credit scores or expired jabs.
Too much bad think detected?
Maybe you get locked in and driven to the nearest camp. Or maybe off a cliff into a lake.

        This post is on point and encapsulates the vacuous existence most are living in the modern age.
Where are the challenges and endeavors to conquer today? Traveling the stars has been relegated to a few billionaires. Technology advancements only strive to deliver products and mindless entertainment in a faster manner to the population.
The ruling class is insane with the belief that we are only exist to worship the almighty GDP Excel spreadsheet. In their eyes we are merely atomized economic units to use in a constant game of Global Tetris for control.

            ‚ÄúAlso he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all ‚Äòprogressive‚Äô thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won‚Äôt do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don‚Äôtonly want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin‚Äôs militarised version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people ‚ÄòI offer you a good time,‚Äô Hitler has said to them ‚ÄòI offer you struggle, danger and death,‚Äô and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet.‚ÄùThat was written in 1940.

                What ‚Äúsold‚Äù Hitler to the German people were results, i.e., relatively easy and painless victory both militarily and economically in the early years 1936-1940.  Hail Caesar!
Once the tide changed the love affair began to crumble.  In the meantime, the Volk enjoyed their comfort, their vacations, their prosperity, their parades.  Then came the Catastrophe.
The fat, stupid, and lazy so-called ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù people are overdue for their own Catastrophe.

                        Similarly, one can argue (and we often do), that the catastrophe has occurred over an equally long period, indeed is still ongoing. To take but one issue, in a very real sense, our nation (and many other once-proudly White nations) have been invaded. Not by bayonet-tipped riflemen, nor by tanks escorted by bomber planes, but rather by lesser breeds, the majority of whom were INVITED by the host country! How often has that happened in world history? Yet it happened right here.

        Before starting today‚Äôs, I must say I missed entirely what was laid out clearly in yesterday‚Äôs ‚ÄúChristian Zionism‚Äù.Hechler lit the fire under Herzl‚Äôs ‚Äúnext year, in Jerusalem!‚Äù, hoping to bring the eschaton.  Herzl‚Äôs rather practical idea to create The Jewish State was ‚Äúwell, why don‚Äôt we just buy it?‚Äù, and the Pennies for Jerusalem program was born.Jerusalem was a deserted derelict, Palestine a wasteland mismanaged by six Arab families, legates of the Ottomans.Once again, Jacob craftily used guile to take the birthright due his bigger, dumber brother- us, ‚ÄúEsau‚Äù, the Aryans he had been marrying into.We taught them to organize and made it possible, again.  Such a deal!The Zman had hinted at the man behind the curtain and we antisemites started baying.  It turns out the enablers cranking the gears are Christian!So easy.  Like candy from a baby.

        I remember I was on a work holiday get together zoom meeting last Christmas (wow, it‚Äôs been so long) and the Karens were virtue signalling about how much they were inconveniencing their families and changing their plans to ‚Äúfight‚Äù COVID.‚ÄúWell *I‚Äôm* not going on a trip this year‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not visiting my grandparents this year, too risky‚ÄùThey kept saying how bad COVID is, but it was clear that they actually quite enjoyed putting themselves under lockdowns, and ‚Äúsacrificing‚Äù themselves for a bigger cause. Looking for meaning. Fwiw these chicks are also hysterical, insane, and likely haven‚Äôt gotten an orgasm from their husbands in over a decade.Normies look everywhere ‚Äì COVID, ethnic food, going Rambo on Afghanistan, casual sex etc. As others have said one can only find true meaning in God, community, family (including racial extended family), and nation.

        It‚Äôs been used before, but The Age of Anxiety‚Äù perfectly suits our times. The American adventure crested when reaching the Pacific, though for a time the further expansion of empire, be it global, or in the realm of space, allayed the inevitable rolling back of that tsunami. Bereft of meaning and purpose, we see this anxiety reflected everywhere as people, searching for meaning, find none in this postmodern world.  The elevation of everyday events into near mythic proportions enables even the trash collector to imagine himself as a ‚Äúhero.‚ÄùModern HeroesBereft of lyric Homer VoiceFolly to Rime heroic VerseYet a troubled Heart leaves no ChoiceBut Speak Thoughts in Mind well-rehearsed.The Age of Heroes, its Race runOn Trojan Plains, in Labyrinth StrandsAchilles‚Äô Games where Honor won;Minotaur felled at Theseus‚Äô Hands.What can compare, O modern ManWhose Knights of the Keyboard en masseVainglorious on Twitter Stand,Victorious o‚Äôer naught but dross?No monsters walk abroad, for they all have been slain;Yet vicious are the ones, in virtual domain

Reminds me of the scene in Charlie Wilson‚Äôs War (excellent movie, by the way) where some evangelical Congresscritter is visiting an Afghan refugee camp. He holds a rousing speech, and every time he says ‚ÄúGod‚Äù, the towelheads all cheer, so he imagine they‚Äôre just like him.

        Orange Man really missed a trick there with his half-hearted Reagan nostalgia.The worst lunatics are always the people who were fully aware of, but unable to participate in, some great social upheaval. All the damage we associate with ‚ÄúThe Sixties‚Äù (or ‚Äúthe Boomers,‚Äù if you prefer) was actually done by people just a hair too old or young to be hippies. The original stuff ‚Äî Civil Rights, the Port Huron Statement, all that ‚Äî came from guys born in the late 1930s. They had vivid memories of WW2, and even more vivid memories of the angry young strangers they met in 1946 and were told to call ‚ÄúDad.‚Äù All the early ‚ÄúSixties‚Äù stuff was their revenge. The later stuff came from the Tom Hanks type cohort ‚Äî people who are certain that they would‚Äôve ended racism and the Vietnam War at Woodstock, if they hadn‚Äôt been in sixth grade at the time. They are responsible for ‚Äúthe 90s,‚Äù the worst decade in human history.Take it back as far as you like. Your most enthusiastic bagel-bashers ‚Äî Himmler, Goebbels, Heydrich, Eichmann ‚Äî had vivid memories of WW1‚Ä¶ that they just missed. The Social Gospel lunatics of the 1880s just missed the Civil War, and so on. What Orange Man should‚Äôve done, then, is weaponized 80s nostalgia. As I wish I could remember who said, the 80s were the last golden Indian summer of America. The worst people today are the ones who have vivid memories of it, but didn‚Äôt really get toexperienceit ‚Äî hence the popularity of stuff like that ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù show, which I‚Äôm told is basically ‚Äú1982, the TV Series.‚ÄùOne could build a robust movement around people who felt they got cheated out of ‚ÄúThe 80s,‚Äù in the same way the previous generation destroyed the world because they got cheated out of ‚Äúthe Sixties‚Äù‚Ä¶ if one were so inclined.

                Sure, except it would be followed by something similar to what we‚Äôre experiencing now. But the Ruling/Managerial Class simply did not have patience. They boldly stole a presidential election, and did it on an industrial scale that cannot be hidden. The results are going to be catastrophic for everyone. I often hear people on the right referring to themselves as ‚Äúaccelerationists.‚Äù No, you‚Äôre not. The Ruling/Managerial Class hold that honor.

            watch ‚ÄúTriumph of The Will‚Äù and pay attention.Not a bad idea, it‚Äôs on YT. You get to see what N√ºrnberg looked like before it got razed.

Terrible quality, alas, somehow nobody ever restored it.The sound bites are rather trite, although Goebbles and Uncle Adolf gives a good show.

There‚Äôs a story this morning, by Joe McDonald, writing for the AP, which is titled ‚ÄúChina bans ‚Äòsissy men‚Äô from TV in new crackdown‚Äù.
Lately I don‚Äôt seem to have any luck poasting URLs chez Z, but it‚Äôs a story worth searching for.
[And if Ang1in hasn‚Äôt written an essay about it yet, then I‚Äôm sure an essay about it will be soon forthcoming].

        &gt; When it started, ever nurse and doctor went on-line every day to tell us how exhausted they were, as if they were rescuers working day and night to save people from a collapsed building.Look at the rhetoric now, and it‚Äôs clear the meaning of many health care people is not to care for the sick, but punish the heretics.  While a lot of it is LARPing, reddit and twitter are full of doctors and nurses practically giggling with glee at refusing Ivermectin and putting the unvaxxed on ventilators.Deep inside everyone knew the medical community was full of low-key psychopaths, but now it‚Äôs socially acceptable for them to show their hate and contempt.

            In fairness to health practitioners, the nature of medical care pretty much precludes any sort of healthy, sympathetic relationship between practitioners and patients. Patients have a general tendency to wait until problems get out of hand before addressing them, distrust medical advice, and seek alleviation for symptoms instead of an underlying cure. This is particularly true of stupid people. Thus, you have lots of instances where overweight sedentary, average-IQ patients come in with a problem, demanding pills or special treatments/therapies they‚Äôve read about online, with no understanding of their actual health problem, or it‚Äôs best solution. Thus, it‚Äôs not hard to understand why lots of health practitioners might hold these sorts of people in contempt. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right, only that is understandable.

                Pretty much a universal theme among doctors I know and I can sympathize.  However, with many of the current generation the boundary seems to have been crossed where instead of just being pissed at not taking their advice, they consider them unworthy of any care at all, and maybe even worthy of active harm.

                    Chet:  It‚Äôs not the stupidity that bothers the doctors; it‚Äôs the implied lack of respect for their ‚Äòstatus.‚Äô  I‚Äôve challenged doctors (all authorities, in any field really) for all my life.  And not from stupidity or cupidity, but trying to find out the truth.  Hard to say who takes it worse, the clerk at the DMV or the vaunted herr doktor.  Prove them wrong (not all that difficult to do) and they hate you with the heat of a thousand suns.  And today it‚Äôs not lack of respect for their implied knowledge and authority, it‚Äôs having the temerity to have different political opinions versus their holy ‚Äòsettled science.‚ÄôAnd, to be honest, I‚Äôd find it equally difficult to care deeply for the health of the fat, slovenly White lady who was in front of me at the pharmacy the other day, taking a loooong time and asking which med was for ‚Äòthe sugar.‚Äô  If I overheard her correctly, she was a mere 2 years my senior (I had just come from the gym and lifting and was picking up something for my husband; I‚Äôm not on any prescription meds).Yes, I understand we need to have charity and assistance for the worst of our people, but some days it‚Äôs really hard to care about people like that.

                        3g4me‚Äîbingo!  Agree 100%.  My impression is that doctors are most aggrieved at being questioned and most adept at simply following ‚Äúauthoritative‚Äù treatment guidelines once they‚Äôve pigeonholed you into a diagnostic category.
The current COVID-19 bs has firmly convinced me of this‚Äîand further, that most doctors are not that smart.  High IQ and a smiling persona not withstanding.

                        Adding to what Compsci said, most of the medical profession is composed of midwit ‚Äúbox-checker‚Äù strivers. They tend be very good at memorizing facts and taking tests. The sign of real intelligence though, is being able to integrate facts from a given field (like medicine) into a whole picture of what is going on, incorporating even one‚Äôs prior knowledge of things in quite different fields in the process. The box-checker struggles to do this though and also looks to authority figures *first* instead of analyzing the problem first and then checking to see if the ‚Äúhigher ups‚Äù reached the same conclusion. The medical profession today is running on the respect and prestige it gathered in earlier times when less was known and the practice of medicine required more actual thinking. Most people aren‚Äôt aware that their beloved doctors are often little more than human search engines.This is a systemic problem today in all the ‚Äúprestige‚Äù fields from journalism to science. The people in them are far more mechanistic than the public knows and are far less skilled at critical thinking than their predecessors. This may be why so many of these people react with childish anger and name calling when challenged (denialist!, anti-science bigot!). They know ‚Äúthe science‚Äù (i.e. the current dogma) but they don‚Äôt understand the reasoning that led to it.  When shown something that seems to refute established dogma they just sit there like a confused robot with smoke pouring out of its ears.

                Nor does it inspire confidence in the medical profession when they prescribe me something that my pharmacy would charge me $169.58 for, when a nearly identical (?) product is over-the-counter for about $10. Is it any wonder that my insurance won‚Äôt cover this Rx?
In this case, I‚Äôve asked the MD to clarify and perhaps, offer a generic. And I‚Äôm sad to say, similar has happened at least once in the past, with other MDs.

            When you realize that hospitals get $10,000 more per ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù Medicare patients, you realize why they are filled with ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù patients. Medicine today has become a racket. Maybe it always was, but there was a time when physicians actually believed the Hippocratic Oath. Now, they believe in getting a Mercedes for their 3rd wife.  It also annoys me that there is so much media attention to how hospitals are at the ‚Äúbreaking point‚Äù because of Covid. But, I don‚Äôt see any evidence of this, although you‚Äôll know someone, who knows someone, that says that the local hospital is at capacity. I never meet any hospital employees that say this. I certainly don‚Äôt see any medical personnel that make the correlation between ‚Äúmax capacity‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonnel shortages‚Äù, either because of burn out or because of required vaccinations. When you add the joke that is the PCR Test being unable to discriminate between Covid and most any other virus and the false diagnosis of anyone at all having Covid, you see the mercenary nature of modern medicine. Admittedly, this is out of the doctors‚Äô and nurses‚Äô hands, since administrators and lawyers drive all the decisions in hospitals. But, most doctors or nurses don‚Äôt step up to oppose this. That would shut down the money treadmill for them.

                The ‚Äúunderstaffing‚Äù is because the bean-counters, watching houly, declared there are too many staff on the floor today, because according to corporate efficiency guidelines, each patient interaction should only take 5 minutes or less‚Äì so everybody gets their hours cut to one day a week.Grampa didn‚Äôt listen, and has spilled his tray, barfed on the floor, got out of bed and fell, pooped his depends, and is demanding something for the 3rd time this hour.  That counts as 5 minutes.The facilities are ‚Äúcrowded‚Äù because the patient beds are socially distanced and a wing or two has been closed to save $, because we‚Äôre not supposed to go in until near death only by covid.Corporate medicine!The bottom line!The numbers are what‚Äôs important!

                I believe it‚Äôs considerably more if the patient is put on a ventilator. Talk about perverse incentives. Last week some guy was tweeting his ER visit (he blew out his knee). His paperwork described his symptoms as pain, swelling, and the inability to put weight on it. They coded his injury as ‚ÄúCovid related.‚Äù

        People of the future looking back on our age and trying to describe it? We don‚Äôt do that now, we used to make an honest effort. They will do what present historians and the like do now, manufacture a narrative that fits their agenda. You know, negroes hanging from poles and trees everywhere. It was bad back then.
Kind of like he that controls the past controls the present. We live in the age of lies. Hopefully your future robot historians will craft an honest research. I suspect we may not get them but will get your future ape historians.

            The official history of times I clearly remember is already wrong, and I‚Äôve only gone 50% gray. Almost everything has been forgotten before we‚Äôre even old, and what remains that isn‚Äôt material artifact is all lies. In my field of expertise, those lies are told by people I know, who were ‚Äúthere‚Äù with me, not experiencing what they now say they did.It‚Äôs disturbing, even at its smallest, e.g.: The true trajectory of the Beastie Boys‚Äô career was obliterated while every fan they ever had is still (statistically) alive. They replaced it with a current_year morality tale, a metonymic pr√©cis of ‚Äúour‚Äù ethical growth from irony to #metoo. What actually happened was, during a slump in their popularity, their fanbase changed from broke and black to proto-woke white, and the band‚Äôs attitudes and aesthetics chased after. Does anyone remember? No. They *really* don‚Äôt. But it happened. We lived through it. It can be demonstrated, documented. Remember? ‚ÄúNice conspiracy theory.‚ÄùWe may have always been like this.

        This age strikes me as being the age of Globohomo: Weimar part 2 (pretty much a repeat but gone global). Most of the planet now had a culture created by the tribe for hysterical females. All of the preposterous narratives are lies that appeal to emotions, the more hysterical the better.The lone major patriarchal holdout with a chance of not succumbing is China. Most of the white pills these days seem to come from them. Billionaires humbled. Entertainment stars ripped of their pedestal. Boys urged to be more masculine with camps to help them become more manly. Many (but not all unfortunately) feminists silenced and pound me too shut down except for when it benefits the patriarchy.

        The rural and small town life before agricultural technology, Wal Marts, and highway improvements got out of hand is probably the closest I personally got to happiness on earth. We still had the old timers around who remembered the very early 20th century, a time before rural electrification.There was strong community and churches then.The same thing was present in cities within the ethnic neighborhoods where until the freeways and the suburbs  and the shopping malls destroyed those connections communities flourished.Man needs more than technology to thrive.But what we will probably get is VR devices strapped to our heads so that we can tour those long gone places in our heads.

            Isn‚Äôt it amazing at how people shriek and howl when their electricity goes out? They won‚Äôt even keep a good kerosene lamp in the house, ready to go, at all times, to light their way when a bad storm blows in. All they know how to do is literally sit in the dark, and bitterly complain about why someone isn‚Äôt doing something for them, right now.

            G Lordon Giddy:  I doubt the powers that be want White people to be allowed to visit their past happiness even via VR ‚Äì could encourage bad thoughts, you know.  It‚Äôs blatantly clear to anyone who‚Äôs trying to buy land or a house or merely move from an overpriced apartment these days that there is a deliberate national and global effort to prevent Whites from forming communities just about anywhere.  Probably 75% of suburban home sales are now to corporations, who massively jack up the selling or rental price.  The goal is not to actually raise capital from it, but to own the property as an investment.  As far as who will actually live there someday, it‚Äôs certainly not intended for White families.Our real estate agent tells me of her exhaustion, showing and doing paperwork and having deals fall through for a myriad of reasons, but the pressure and the sheer number of people trying to buy land or housing ‚Äòsomewhere else‚Äô is truly astonishing.  She said both the two local land surveyors asked not to be sent anymore requests for surveys until February 2022, they are so backed up.  I asked her if there were going to be any locals left by the time we built our house and moved up there ‚Äì of course, that presumes we‚Äôd be able to get to our property in another state without proof of vaxx.  Sidenote: I‚Äôm not going to the soon-to-be Sabaton concert locally because they also have the vaxx or test requirement.  It may not be explicit everywhere, but the implicit requirement and force behind it is becoming more widespread and blatant.

            Interesting. As someone who turns 60 this year, my fond memories are of what replaced the bygone era you describe. I miss clean, orderly, dare I say, 100% White, suburbia, visits into the big city (the parts that hadn‚Äôt deteriorated yet; it was only a decade or two into Civil Rights), the convenience of rapid travel on the still-new super highways.  Perhaps that‚Äôs partly normal nostalgia for what‚Äôs past. But it‚Äôs no exaggeration to say that most of that is gone, at least in the places where I experienced it.The upscale shopping mall that replaced fields of rolling hills and forest I once dirt biked upon, the still-extant bike trail once through woods and fields now a thin line of green crowded on both sides by cheek-by-jowl ugly townhomes and cheaply built million dollar homes, the browning and blacking of communities once downy white, these are all symptoms not of progress, but of decadence. Although I still am slave to the comfort of civilization, as each day passes I understand why my father retired deep into the woods, far from the madness of crowds.

        Perhaps normal people are starved for choice in the spiritual realm, but our progressive enemies are quite fulfilled in their version of the great awakening. We see it as madness, but they see it as a jihad. The danger is their religion sweeps across the land like Muslims in the 7th century, and we‚Äôre in for a thousand years of a Clownworld Sultanate.

        Great stuff from Zman. May I suggest our host write part 2 of this essay on the Age of Recognition?
As Reynard implied, the quest for meaning and the quest for recognition seem to have merged these days. It‚Äôs not enough to search for meaning, because in this age of narcissism and exhibitionism, meaning has no meaning unless society recognizes the individual seeker.

            That‚Äôs very interesting point though about the need for recognition. In the past we had a homogeneous and monolithic society. We belonged to true communities. ‚ÄúRecognition‚Äù from the community was granted by age old traditions, and was on a much smaller scale‚Äì it was entirely parochial. We had traditions, rituals, rites of passage for such a thing.I grew up in a Catholic family. The individual goes through several rituals and rites of passage throughout their life: baptism, confirmation, marriage, milestone anniversary, funeral. These are all societal moments of recognition. I have an unread copy of Bowling for Soup sitting around, but I know we had many more secular institutions, like men‚Äôs clubs, which fulfilled the same purpose.  There are very few options now days. There is no community, there are no traditions, and consequently there is no recognition besides what we can scrap together from total strangers in a virtual setting.

                Excellent. Dovetails with the other day, re: hierarchy. Absent the infrastructure of a culture that provides incentives that conform to shared values and accrue status upon those who fulfil those rites ‚Äì while folding individuals back into the service of their people, the result is those rites of passage ‚Äì or said differently, the channeling of biology‚Äôs wont to break from pro-civil behaviors, will still happen, but instead they are directed by one‚Äôs base motives animated by a culture of freelance opportunism and self-indulgence. Cue the dark triad men and feral, narcissistic women.There is a reason that rites and the corresponding duties aligned with biological ages and roles within the family, tribe, community etc. Another of Chesterton‚Äôs fences. The dishonesty about the state of man (and especially woman) has been championed by the hubris of modernity. Worse, it is further insulated from the harsh and immediate feedback of nature‚Äôs corrective hand by the silk sheets of abundance.That sense of purpose ‚Äì I argue its really a sense of duty or ‚Äúservice‚Äù, is left to the idle whimsy of feeding those base impulses. Like most traditions deemed oppressive or backwards by Progress, the stewardship of channeling biology into pro-civil status and duties gave way to unbridled expressions of individualism and self-‚Äúempowerment‚Äù, primarily as a function of conspicuous consumption.Duty is now dopamine mining. Status accrues on the back of that dragon;  random, disconnected, and ever more demanding of moar novelty and ever more discivic. A social economy of abject poverty of lottery tickets. The problem being there is always a winner, proving the system to be fit.

        It reminds me of the G.K. Chesterton quote: ‚Äú‚ÄúWhen a man stops believing in God, he doesn‚Äôt believe in nothing, he believes in anything.‚Äù In a similar sense, when you take away a unified purpose in society, the individual doesn‚Äôt merely lack meaning, he projects meaning onto everything and hunts for it any way he can.Today we have narcissists who crave attention by any means (mainly via social media). This is the only meaning they can find in their life.‚ÄúThese pointless and foolish acts are driven by a need to be seen as men with a purpose beyond the role they play.‚ÄùEveryone is playing a role these days. Everyone wants to be the hero of their own action/drama movie. And they see you and everyone else to be their popcorn eating audience. But if everyone is a movie star, there is no audience.
