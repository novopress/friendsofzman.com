        Yesterday I read the GQ profile of Christopher Knight.  Fascinating guy, but not for the reasons that the author thinks.  I’ll say one thing for Knight – he’s more honest about himself than his interviewer is.  But he is still deluded.Knight is the ultimate refutation of Rousseau’s ruinous nostrum that man is born free in nature, and enslaved by civil society.  On the contrary, only in civil society can man fully realize his potential for freedom. This is not to assert that civil society is not capable of being destructive and injurious to freedom.  Of course it can.  But civil society is the starting point.I can’t think of anyone who was less free than Christopher Knight.  An intelligent man was reduced by Nature to total need.  He was reduced to his most basic functions, sensory, gustatory, and excretory.  Knight could not see ten feet in front of him – his world was eventually reduced to a dim grey screen.  Despite incessant reading to pass the time, Knight’s intellect ceased to function; in his solitude, there was no deep thought or soul shattering illumination.  By his own admission, when he left the woods he had nothing to say, nothing to reveal.  He drifted in, drifted around, drifted out.  He gets points for surviving, but again that is basic, primal.  A roach can survive a nuclear event – does that make the roach free, in the celebratory and hortatory sense of the term?Like I state, I give Knight credit.  He knows that there is no “lesson” to be derived from his experience, no “moral”.  His freedom was the freedom of nothingness.

        The welfare state has demonstrated an impressive efficiency in destroying every people in it’s reach wherever it has been deployed, excepting, possibly, the Jews, for whom it merely tends to freeze progress.

        “Knight never fully explained why he disappeared into the woods, telling GQ that he didn’t have a reason and that it was a mystery to him too.”
I hope they got his DNA sample and are running it through cold case databases. Something tells me this guy wasn’t in the woods because he enjoyed camping. I might agree that the “aesthetics” of modern life feel diminished, but that sounds like a flimsy reason to spend 30 years hiding in the woods.

        North Pond is not Walden Pond and Christopher Knight is no Henry David Thoreau.  At least he wasn’t on government welfare.  A lot of Mainers are, city dwellers and rural folk alike.  They’ve “dropped out” too, but I don’t see any merit in that.

            My definition of dropping out does no include sponging off society. As far as Maine, it is becoming Appalachia North. I blame the French.

        This hermit unlawfully, by means of force and fear, took personal property?  A thousand times?  That’s what robbery is. If Michael Brown taught us nothing else…

        I’m sorry, but the hermit had it wrong.  He was no independent yeoman living off the fat of the land.  He was a thief, and a mooch.  He only survived by stealing from the poor saps who sucked it up and participated in the system.This is always the case with all these forms of higher hippiedom.  They claim they are separating themselves from a corrupt society, wrapping themselves in a mantle of purity, but they are utterly dependent on that society.  They get sick, they go to the “free” clinic, or the emergency room.  They steal, or busk, in order to eat.  They spend their money, if they have it, on pop culture and drugs.  They think they are free, but they are more enslaved than the office dorks they hold in contempt.There is no freedom in nature.  The guy who loved grizzlies got eaten by one.  The kid who dropped out and walked into the woods died of starvation and exposure.  The days of Davy Crockett are over.  These days your back to nature drop out is likely to be a vegan.  He won’t hunt or fish, so he steals.  There is no tofu in the paradise.The only viable drop-out model is the old medieval monastic order(s).  The monasteries were a haven for those who could not function in the wider culture, but were genuinely independent and self-sustaining.  But note that a monastery is a community, with strict rules and discipline.  You don’t get to sit around and smoke weed all day, and get in touch with yourself.
