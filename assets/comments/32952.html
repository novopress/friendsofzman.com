        Every chance we get we should impose diversity on the elites (and on every liberal we know).  Shame your liberal friends into getting black doctors.  Demand our military and top level officials fly on jets with black pilots.   Tell them to take migrants into their neighborhoods. Encourage feminists to let transsexuals into their locker rooms. You’ve got to be vicious and strategic.  The character of these people never changes but they do feel pain and they will back off.

            Well you hit the nail right on the head, T.I got into the workforce just affirmative action was ramping up. The diverse workplace back then was in the shipping department and out on the shop floor with the peons… but you never saw it in the office where the management worked – and for good reason. Management HAD to be taken seriously, dontchya know!!!Whenever I was hunting for a job hunting I kept a very sharp eye out for diversity. If I had to work in close proximity to it I turned my nose up at it.F that rattle…

                In general I concur, but there will always be exceptions to the rule. For  example, if some of the co-workers were women that looked like Halle Berry (in her prime) I would swallow my racist pride and try to make the best of a difficult work environment.

                This is a point I make a lot. They’re not even hypocrites. Being a hypocrite assumes you have the same rulebook, but hold yourself to a different standard (or exempt yourself).What people don’t understand is that there are two completely different rule books. One for the Chosen People and one for the Bad People. The Team Blue rulebook doesn’t even contemplate the idea that they might have to conform to rules in the Team Red rulebook.Which is how you get to be a complete racist who hates white people. Team Blue? Totes cool. Abortion? Not even required to acknowledge it’s a life form, let alone a person. Unless it’s a future Republican, then suddenly yes, that child should be killed.Because the overriding rule in the Team Blue rulebook is: The ends justify the means.The reason they hate Trump so much is he’s on Team Red but keeps using the Team Blue rulebook against them.Win or lose next week, in 100 years the picture of Trump yelling “Fight!”, wearing a McDonalds uniform and handing out fries, and riding in a garbage truck will be iconic.  Dissidents will print copies and hide them away to share with their children while Google sends drones into their homes to search for Bad Thoughts.Their fear is that Team Red has burned the Team Red Rulebook and has started writing its own rules.

            There is a vast gulf between the liberals and the elites. You might force DEI on the former, and that will happen if this proceeds (it may collapse soon), but the latter–never. You never will see video of the pilots who ferry the anointed to Davos.

                    I’ve commented before on the White pilots who fly around black ‘celebrities’ like JayZ or provide security for them.  Unfortunately, there have always been Whites who will do despicable things for money.

                        White people in professional fields try to be professionals. When you drive the truck you don’t get to decide what is loaded in the back. A pilot is still an employee with a family to feed, quitting over bad freight is rather silly.

                            By your reasoning, then, the ‘professional’ nurse who assists in ‘genderreassignment surgery’ is just an employee doing her job and declining to participate or looking for other work in the field would be ‘rather silly.’

                                How about a surgen saving the life of a child you don’t like the race of. Should an airline pilot refuse to fly the pax who are the wrong race.
Your example is rediculus and extreme. Gender affirming care is not a public service last I checked. I think everone in the field are abusing children in the worst possible way and should be jailed.
I think transportation services fall in a slightly different catagory.

                                    I’m not talking about public transportation or even chartered planes.  These are private planes and private pilots who are highly paid to fly around trash and they do it for the money.  You obviously see commerce and businesses as race neutral.  I do not.  And a surgeon is not a public servant and ought to be able to decide to whom he is willing to provide his services and expertise.  No, I do not consider health care a God or government-ordained ‘right.’

                                        An ER is somewhat of a public utility.
A lot of celebrities fly commercial and corporate. The pilots have no choice on who is in the back. You imply they should quit and walk away over flying trashy celebs and politicos.
You should be specific that the pilots who fly their personal planes are bad humans and not generalize.
The vast majority of profesional pilots are just workers. Maybe we are all just scum to work in the corrupt American sustem. YIMV.

                        We have plenty of evidence and get more daily that there is no shortage of white people who are willing to betray and sell out their own people in a way that other races simply do not. We saw it vividly in Ohio just a couple months ago. Maybe it is due to the centuries of strife in Europe but there is something in our make up that leaves us unable to look out for each other.

                Yes. If I had ever gotten tenure I would have trolled the fuck out of them. I would have had a blast. I would have gone into the Faculty Senate and demanded that they change the name of the college to “George Floyd University,” LOL.
Alas… I never got tenured because they figured out that you don’t give people who are not on Team Left the ability to use the same power they use against everyone else.

                One of the rare times that the Right made the Left live up to the edicts that they impose on us underlings
Way, way more of that is needed.  Make the consequences of their totalitarianism hurt, personally.  This is the only lingo they understand and respond to.
The Right must stop apologizing and wanting to Be Friends with enemy elements.  Like Trump’s first term — immediately wanting to Be Bygones with Hillary.  Let’s all get along b.s.  That told me he ain’t got what it takes.

                    To be fair to Trump, he did put his hand out across the aisle to unify what was a very divided country.
Where he failed spectacularly was not realising early on that you can’t make deals with people who go only for the kill.
He compounded that error by putting his enemies into positions of power in the government where they could do a Julius Caesar on him.The left then went on to impeach him twice and he still didn’t get it.

            Way too many of them care more about what they say and how it makes them feel than what they actually do and whether the results are beneficial to anyone.  They’re just as likely to tell you “I’d go see a black doctor, but you know, I have a very unique and rare situation, and medical schools discriminate against blacks, so the white doctor was my only choice.”I personally enjoyed women getting the snot beat out of them at the Olympics last summer.  I can chirp from the cheap seats until I turn blue, or I can just widely share video of a woman being pulverized by a man in the boxing ring.  Then I laugh and mock it.Sometimes the best answer is to just be patient and they’ll get punched in the face a few times.  They’ll never change their minds, but watching them get punched in the face?  Priceless.For the rest of us?  Just walk away and refuse to participate.  We did more good last year destroying Budweiser than all the cries of hypocrisy.  We just need to get better at sustaining it.

                I concur with your approach.  I don’t go around demanding group boycotts, and almost every retail company is equally loathsome, but I have to buy food and household goods somewhere, so I grit my teeth and generally try to get the best deal I can.  But I have never bought Chobani and I refuse to by Tysons – and now that I know they’ve joined with Ulukaya’s immigrant scheme, Irefuse to buy Boar’s Head.  It helps to have an alternative (where we now live I buy Kretschmar cold cuts).I, too, enjoy watching women squeal about the trannies – every last female afflete has demanded equal access and equal funding to men, because they deem it ‘fair,’ regardless of lack of audience or interest.  I don’t believe women ought to be professional athletes at all.  And after they invaded every last male space, turnabout is fair play.  While my spending alone may not make a difference, if enough Whites did their  best to discriminate in spending, I believe it would make a much bigger impact than voting does, in AINO’s corpocracy.

                    As I’m fond of saying at rightie sites like Breitbart, there would be NO ‘trans’ anything were it not for a century of preceding feminism, which demanded trans, homosexual celebrationism, drag queen story hour, and all the rest of it.The Breitbartians hate hate HATES hearing that they and their entitled daughters and wives birthed transsexualism.  Better to roar and rage and pretend they had nothing to do with it, whilst borrowing an aggrieved and innocent tone.  When in fact, those very dotter-daddies approved and paid for it.American women and weak men created the frankenstein of trans.  Now he shows up at all your athletic competitions to rub their Holy Feminism in their shocked faces.

                            I would bet you large sums that those sad grandparents never discussed racial reality with their children and never lay down unambiguous lines about what they would and would not accept as far as future family members (our boys knew early on).  Weak, shriveled fruit from poorly-rooted trees.  The fact that they are willingly accepting and caring for mixed-race grandchildren tells you all you need to know.

Whether you think this all started in 1865 or 1965, or whenever, it’s not like we woke up one morning and, “Oh, noes, our country is full of ferriners!” It took decades at the very least, though it was heavily weighted in the last few.
It’s going to take baby steps to get back from where we are, too. Probably more time than it took to get here, because entropy.
Hopefully progression on that path is acceptable, or might as well throw in the towel now.

                    When self-checkout first started, they were a godsend. Even the express aisles were a couple miles long, and a lot of the people had well over 20 items. A single clerk could handle maybe a dozen checkouts, so I was able to get out of there with my bottle of scotch, maybe waiting 30 seconds for the ID check, because they always prioritized people who had few items.

            Been hearing a lot of that.I live in an average American city that rarely makes the news and has no reputation for being minority-filled. It’s 80% white, steadily so since an Asian influx in the ’80s—says this official graph here. I live near one of their churches, so I seethoseAsians all the time, in graph-appropriate numbers. But I only see white people—more than apairof white people—when I do white-people-specific things, like shop for specialty gasoline or go see some avant-garde chamber music.The numbers are fake. Our eyes are just starting to adjust to the darkness. By the time wesee, I doubt we’re even 25%. I doubt we’re over a third right now.

                Poor silly Scandi bastards! They don’t realize that the US is turning into one of those third world countries that borders other third world countries. The official government of country A controls its capitol city while, hundreds of miles away, you have the capitol of country B, which is totally controlled by their government. The intervening territory just slowly fades from the A type of peasants to the B type with local “security” being provided by whatever local warlords or narco-gangs happen to have the most firepower.I can easily imagine that eventually the “USA” will be greater DC and the metroplex up to NYC, while Mexico starts in Northern VA.

                That applies across much of AINO today.  The Texas public school in a neighboring DFW suburb, a few blocks from where we drove our older son to his private, Christian primary school was almost entirely mestizo.  The public primary school in the prosperous ‘safe’ suburb in which we lived (and thankfully left 20 months ago) and where our younger son attended first grade is today 26% White.  Yet another example of why I despise voting.  Demography is destiny.

Bingo.  Nail on the head.  There is this strange idea that all of this damage is somehow reversible. It is not. All that lies ahead is figuring out how you will survive the new ‘Murica.  There is no going back to the place it once was.  It may as well be called Little Africa now.

                So many are WAY the hell too gloomy. The solution is that the Empire must die. ALL empires die, so this is not some wild fantasy, but a certainty. It’s also true historically that the imperial elite governing empires that are about to die rarely see it coming, and most were a lot smarter than the trash running the GAE. It’s like predicting rain. The ‘when’ and the ‘how much’ is hard, but predicting that it is going to happen at all is trivial. Even the Sahara Desert has precipitation events.It’s not about ‘country’ any more. It’s about people, our European people.America-that-was is a rotting corpse, stinking in the breeze. Mourn it and get the grief out of your system. There are way more than enough of us to form a new self-sustaining defensible polity when the imperial state twitches its last death throe.How long will that be? Your guess is as good as mine. It could be next year. It could be in 50 years.So what if they borders are different? Do you know how many times the borders enclosing the German people have changed over the last 2000 years? The Spaniards fought a 700 year war get their land back after Islamic invasion. The Italians fought 30 years to expel their Islamic invaders. We need to leave the merchant-heritage timescales in our American thinking behind.Endure and resist in what ways you can. You have no idea what Black Swans may come smack globohomo on tranny arse. No one in 1913 could imagine what was coming. These idiots could spark nuclear attacks on New York City, Washington DC, and City of London. We could have a solar event that takes down the grid for months or a volcanic event lowering insolation and suppressing crop production for a decade. Then everything would change.If there is one thing I’ve learned from reading the vast literature of the Soviet resistance on the Eastern Front during WW2, it’s that you NEVER quit. They lost staggering numbers of men: a million in a pocket here, a half million there, again and again and again, but they never gave up. Victory is never assured, but defeat is assured when you give up. This struggle is for our living people and their unborn, not some dead country.

                    Horace – official borders or precise territory is the least of my concerns.  White people are under 10% of the world’s population.  Whites in AINO are perhaps 53% – including however many shitlibs.  About 64% of the US population below age 40 is non-White.  Those millions either need to be expelled or exterminated by fewer and fewer White youth (again including shitlibs).  I consider that more than gloomy, and will notrely on hopium.

                    Agreed there is too much DOOM, but an EMP or Carrington event is not going to affect TPTB all that much. They probably won’t have to cut their air travel all that much. Most of the .mil hangers are EMP protected, as well as a fair share of commercial. Plenty of generators and transformers safely hidden away, as long as you are only taking care of thousands, not tens of millions.A financial collapse would leave most people to busy with root hog or die to do anything, either. AINO is going to be resilient.Like it or not, you can’t realistically toss out 40% of the population, then 50% of the remainder, then probably 95% of that number and hope to succeed.Going into any struggle with even numbers is for sucks. Here we are assumingwe can do it outnumbered 50:1. And we are using the rosiest of assumptions to end up at 50:1.

        This is rampant in the corporate world.  But in olden tymes, the “first” to be elevated to a position was generally smart enough to understand the game that was being played. So they would surround themselves with competent people and it all worked out.  Worked indirectly for two of those early in my career.  Problem now is you have these “new” university cohorts that have been told how “special” and “smart” they are from grade school (as well as how “bad” whitey is), thus hubris + no self reflection.  And they surround themselves with Chavez types.  You can’t work around that the way you could in old days.  So instead we just get civilizational entropy.

            I recently saw this with a former client. Girl boss replaced old white guy who was there forever. She then cleared out the finance department of the pale and stale, replacing them with diversity. Soon, I started receiving calls about how various programs and processes were not working. These are things that were put in place long ago. I would get emails like “I entered all of the data but now it is missing. The system must have erased it.” Turned out that she did not understand how to save her work.Something that compounds this is the millennial assumption that all the systems they inherited exist to keep them safe from themselves. They have never known a time when technology was not there to prevent them from making errors or there to salve their booboos when they made an error. The incompetent workman now blames his tools, rather than himself.

                        D-K effect aside, competent individuals are often not promoted because they are competent and therefore threatening to incompetent superiors.  There are variations of this.I recall this happening to me in a position I held.  I completed a project for which I was recruited directly by the CEO to complete (it was months overdue)—in 6 weeks.  The powers that be (between me and the CEO) assembled to discuss the roll out and process and see the demo.  I was then specifically not allowed to present such, but rather had to “train” superiors to make the presentation.I was naive in those days, but not that naive.  I was in essence fired after that via no more assignments and the project there after handled by that superior—and I’m certain all the credit accrued to him.

                            That happened to me.  I’ve found imcompetent bosses give you a run down of a problem, ask for your opinion, then present your opinion to superiors and then take credit for it.  Or they just flat out don’t manage, a team of three i was once on, myself and two women.  If you combined both of their outputs i still out performed them by 50%.  You can only do this so long before you begin to burn out, but don’t you dare ask your manager to have the girls pick it up, even though you’re all paid the same amount.  Paycheck gap my ass, more like effort.

                        First, I meant “Second paragraph.” Second, he is not talking about talented exceptions; he is discussing the unwashed median. Third, the world has become a bumper car ride or padded room for young folks (the proxy for tech), but they have no understanding of how this ride or room works, and, therefore, they cannot maintain the system that insulates them, and they lack the self-awareness and efficacy to address that issue.I work with young folks, about 18, that are probably the top 5% of the nation’s youth in this age bracket. I like them and they like me. I am very good at my job. But I have been doing this for a good number of years, and the level of helplessness of young folks is distressing. This helplessness derives from the ability for tech to present proper “rails” for them to ride upon. Thus, they rely on manna from Heaven that has always taken care of them (from calculators to grammarly to chatgpt to worksheets to airbags) and never know how to fish for themselves (apologies for the terribly mixed metaphors).

                The guard rails are just the latest manifestation of a general disinterest in learning the “why” of things. Starting somewhere in the late Boomer, crescendoing in mid Z, underlings wanted to know the answer to the problem, like their teachers trained them, instead of understanding how the system works.

                        There are some of those, to be sure. I find it very difficult to believe that even in a 25-ish person company, there wasn’t one Silent or older Boomer who, if asked, wasn’t happy to share what he knew. Sometimes in excruciating detail. Which is largely why they had to be asked, and, eventually, were hesitant anyway — too many, “Don’t you ever shut up?”
As an older X, you’ve seen that, I’m sure.

                I hired a negress once for the simple reason that on objective measures, she was the best candidate among an indifferent lot. I now regret it. She has become a social pest, and particularly right now as the tsunami of Trump derangement reaches its crest. If such a situation arises again, I will hire the “second-best” candidate.

                    Yep. I realized long ago that there is no upside to associating with blacks — even the “good ones” — because everything becomes fraught with the potential for racial tension.
There is nothing — NOTHING — I need in life that I cannot get from the other 87% of the population.

        The worst part is that, because these people are superstitious primitives, there will never come a “you won’t have Nixon to kick around moment” for the white race. Surely, if a state were to hypothetically lose one-hundred percent of its white population, they could not blame that state’s failures on the white man? Oh, but they could, and would (and will, if they get the chance.) There could literally be no white people left in America, and, like a neolithic cult, the diversity would gather around statues and paintings of white people and shout at them. “There’s no more glow juice (electricity) in the magic boxes (computer monitors and TV screens) because the big bearded white man (the Lincoln Memorial Statue) is withholding it from us out of spite!”Of course, our flight or secession (or even extermination) won’t be quite so clean and complete. That’s good news for us, as even a small group can multiply quickly, if they’re resilient. But it’s bad news because it means those whites lacking resources to escape are going to get all the negative attention that would otherwise go to the statues and portraits of long-dead whites. I was in the minority as a white guy in many places as a young man, from schools to workplaces. I imagine it’s only gotten more hellish since then for those kids left behind. Unless you’re incredibly tough or charismatic, you get devoured very quickly in those environments. The national news hides it but local blotters coast to coast are filled with details of daily pogroms against white kids, up to and including murder. A lot of these murderers are black adults killing white children, showing up in court, laughing, and getting less time than smalltime, retail dope dealers would. No “football numbers” getting doled out to them, as the cons say about sentences of ten years or more.I don’t think I’ve ever felt the kind of rage I experienced the last few days when the Obamas ferried themselves across Martha’s Vineyard to lecture America. Obama, ridiculous as it sounds at this remove, did actually have the chance to lower the temperature. This was all willful and intentional. I finally understand the kind of rage that vendetta-prone Italians in the old country felt, wanting to literally just bite another man on the cheek and spit the bloody mess in his face. I guess I’m a bit of a “primitive” myself.

        One of the attributes of civilisations in decline and dissolution is the lack of attention to detail and quality, the lack of emphasis on quality and performance. And this is throughout the collective West, not just the USA. Sure, DEI is a major culprit — but the malaise goes deeper than this and one might argue that the tolerance of DEI is itself a symptom of broader decadence. Performance and accomplishment have largely ceased to matter in both popular and elite culture. Hence my running around manically to find a competent mechanic, a competent electrician, a competent plumber, a competent locksmith. And these typically tend to be older white men in their fifties and sixties. People like that character played by Clint Eastwood in that 2008 film, “Gran Torino.” When they’re gone, a key element of the undergirding of western civilization will be gone. As it is, I doubt anyone here feels comfortable flying on a recently assembled Boeing aircraft.

            A few years ago my wife wanted our kitchen cabinets redone. The older white guy who built them originally gave us a bid my wife considered to be high, so she went with some Mexican guy instead (she is part Scottish and something of a cheapskate, so when she goes cheap I tell her inner Scotswoman is showing). The Mexican made a mess of it, so she hired the white guy to undo the mess and refinish the cabinets, which cost more, of course.

                Same here. If it’s an old white man, I accept his bid without haggling. You get what you pay for. You want quality, you pay for it. One of my mentors decades ago hammered into my skull the saying, “Not cheap at any price.”

Millennial twat dentist with woke stickers on her car who inherited Daddy’s dental practice referred me to a couple of greasy Pajeets who took my insurance.

        That last sentence. Keep your eye on the Middle East, because the incompetence that has infected our institutions has reached into the military-industrial complex and into the highest reaches of the Pentagon. It will be difficult to gaslight 300 million Americans should one of our aircraft carriers get split in two by a Persian missile.

            That’s what it’s going to take, unfortunately. A Battle of Sedan-type disaster is wonderfully clarifying for the national mood. Alas, it’ll have to be in a declared war against a near-peer opponent. Not just Houthi and the Blowfish doing it, as that will be written off as sneaky Arabs getting lucky (as they so often do, vs. AINO). But since Netanyahu is so obviously trying to drag AINO into a war with Iran, at the same time the Neocons are so obviously trying to drag AINO into a war with Russia, many opportunities to lose a carrier or three should be emerging shortly.

                I’ve seen this concept called a ‘1905 moment’, a reference to the Russians being surprised at the ass-kicking the Japanese gave them during their brief 1905 war, which did massive damage to the old regime’s legitimacy. The Russians were so used to fighting central Asians with mid 80’s IQ, that they failed to make the distinction that Japanese (iq 105 population mean) were simply not more of the same. It damaged the regime’s auras of invincibility when it was needed most in the years before WW1 when they were attempting massive social and economic reform.The mistake was pretty unforgivable, because the data was right out there in the open. The very same time Americans were enduring our War of Northern Aggression with ironclads and railroads the Japanese were having a civil war also with ironclads and railroads. Forty years later the Japanese were building warshipssuperior to those of Russia.We are well set up for our own 1905 moment. Our army has been hollowed out keeping personnel up for the units deployed against Russia, with their equipment and doctrine decades obsolete. The navy is obsolete and filled with incompetents. The air force is still powerful, but is one punch. Even now, and I remember all the objections to it happening at the beginning, but way too many critical parts are sourced from China and elsewhere overseas. Airframe readiness rates are at record lows in peacetime. When spare parts dry up in wartime AND THEY WILL, globohomo airforce will be forced to cannibalize planes to keep some running, like the Iranians had to do with their F-14’s back in the day. Airframe readiness rates will drop to the single digits, and that’s even if they suffer no combat losses, which isn’t going to happen.I don’t think China or Russia are worried in the slightest about the potential of losing a conventional war with FUSA. They are worried for two reasons. One, they don’t want a war at all, because even they beat globohomo’s tranny ass, it won’t be a bloodless beatdown, and they don’t want to pointlessly lose people and suffer economic disruption for no gain. Two, WHEN they spank the Empire, globalists will be forced to either acknowledge the most profound strategic defeat (utterly unexpected by the dumbdumb people, and hence with maximum psychological shock value) in human history, or go nuclear. No one wants to bet on the rationality of the trash who rule over us.

                Losing a carrier in the Persian Gulf won’t be enough.  There will be plenty of excuses to go around and while it would hurt, it wouldn’t be devastating. A devastating blow could be launched against the Houthis or Iran or whoever.  This would cause a lot of problems, but probably not spell the end of the empire.Losing a carrier in the Taiwan Straight is another story.  Sending in another carrier to deal a blow could easily end up with another carrier on the sea floor.  There would be no chance of replacing them in a timely manner.  Given these risks, America would likely back down and with it the empire goes down.I remember when the idiots running our country back in the 00s and early 10s kept insisting China would become “democratic” for some unnamed reason as it became more wealthy.  What kind of moron believes that when you do something and it causes you to become wealthy, once you become wealthy, you will see the ‘error of your ways’ and entirely change?  These same people are still in charge.

                    Not entirely true. The Shanghai district became the first “free-trade zone” in China in the ’90s. (As “free-trade” as China has, or even the USSA, for that matter.)
Their economic boom is largely correlated to their liberalization. The wogs’ mistake was thinking the Chinese would prefer a high standard of living and freedom to communism and authoritarianism.

                        Liberalization of trade and commerce is not general liberalizaton (“Democracy”).There was never any reason whatsoever to assume China would embrace globohomo.
People don’t stop doing something that is creating an outcome they wanted.  This is why I also don’t believe China is going to embrace a new Maoism either, despite the recent crackdowns.

                            Things with China did not go as predicted because the people running AINO could not admit that the Han Chinese have a far stronger ethnic, political, and psychological will than AINO.
This is why the Han Chinese were able to resist converting their society to a political system that would have been compatible with the long-term goals of AINO.

“What kind of moron believes that when you do something and it causes you to become wealthy, once you become wealthy, you will see the ‘error of your ways’ and entirely change?”
The Han did change, but only in some market reforms. They assumed once Chinese people saw what the market would do for them, internal pressure would do the rest. Sometimes that’s been true, sometimes not.

                    I’ve heard a lot of people say that, if a carrier is sunk near Taiwan that the US would be forced to nuke Beijing and Shanghai.
Somehow I don’t find that credible. But there are lots and lots of Americans who believe WW II was won by bombing, so I suppose anything is possible.

            Today’s aircraft carriers are as obsolete as battleships were in World War II. The only thing keeping them afloat, should the United States pick a fight with the wrong country, is the residual fearof its militaryleft over from the 1940s.

                10 years ago, even 5 years ago, everyone was droning on about how 2gw was obsolete and how even 3rd gen warfare was fading slowly and everyone would have to learn how to do 4th gen warfare.  Here we are, back at 2nd gen warfare.When they stop building new carriers, I’ll believe they are obsolete.  People were saying tanks were obsolete.  War requires a lot of shipping. A lot of movement of people on the seas.  Having an offshore mobile base for planes seems like a pretty big advantage in war.Perhaps they are obsolete, but only against peer enemies with hypersonic cruise missiles.  A kind of partial obsolesces.  OTOH, we’ve yet to see one of these battles take place.

            My 4-D theory is someone in the Pentagon has been tasked with tipping the Iranians off about what Israel is doing in order to prevent the big war between Israel and Iran. Lots of rumors about the last Israel attack having to be aborted. They supposedly put a hundred planes in the air and then fired a few dozen missiles at some abandoned buildings. The rumor is they encountered air defenses they did not know the Iranians possessed and had to abort the mission.Of course, if Iran knew what was coming, they would be better able to intercept the Israeli planes. Most likely the first wave was to take out Iranians air defense and then a second wave would strike various military targets. The rumor is Iranian AD locked on Israel jets well before they got within range and maybe the Iranians knew exactly when and where they would be.It is a theory. It seems clear that the Pentagon wants nothing to do with war in the Levant or Ukraine. They see the problem. For now they are winning the debate, but time will tell.

                The Americanmilitary industrial complex (MIC)have been running a scam on the taxpayer for decades now, whereby they wage lopsided conflicts against third world peasants with overpriced weapons of questionable efficacy. The end of the Cold War could have been a problem for them, as no one was funding the farmers and herdsmen, but they solved this by funding both sides themselves (perhaps unintentionally).The Middle East is a far bigger problem for the MIC. They cannot say no to the Jewish-influenced politicians upon whom their funding relies, any more than they can risk having their scam exposed. Dead Ukrainians may be explained away by state media, but bodies of Israelis under the rubble of Tel Aviv would be a catastrophe ofunimaginable proportions. Desperate times for the MIC!

                Supposedly the latest, greatest gen 5 F-35Is were easily tracked by Iranian radar and had to turn back after an early launch. The Israeli F35s are probably better than the scrap heap ones in our military and have a much higher in-service ratio compared to ours well under 50%. Yet the neos are slavering for a shot at backwards Russia.

                From the descriptions I’ve read and heard, it sounds as though the radar warning receivers (RWRs) in the Israeli aircraft lit up like a Christmas tree and reported, “Signal Unknown,” which spooked them.
That RWR report absolutely should spook them for a couple reasons. One is the obvious idea that they were being tracked and a firing solution was being developed.
The second reason is that it signifies a serious lapse in AINO’s signals intelligence, which is one of the areas of electronic warfare where AINO was believed to still hold a significant advantage versus the Russians.

                    My “info” (rumors, really) is a few decades old, but I would question the foregoing narrative just a bit, never the less.No sensible big country in its right mind is going to share its latest signals intelligence or other “above top secret” tech with an ally. Not Russia with Iran, and Not the US even with Our Greatest Ally.Whatdoesalmost surely exist is espionage by friendly allies. Technical know-how, classified and otherwise, has been exiting the US for longer than I’ve been alive. We’re speaking here mainly of the classified stuff. China gets most of the press for borrowing our secrets. But surely Israel has been helping itself to our secrets for a very long time too.In Cold War years, Soviet Union of course stole a lot of our stuff. In my then-field, was the infamous Whitworth Walker spy ring that for decades sold them not only some of our most classified codes, but also the hardware to run it on. Or more specifically, their designs. This latter is an important point: Just because you have the blueprints doesn’t mean you can build the hardware, at least in quantity.While Iran clearly has manufacturing ability, I would be surprised if their highest tech were on par with Russia’s much less EU nations, America or even China.On the other hand, I’m sure Israel can build most stuff as well or better than anything we can do in America. And to this final point: If they can, what’s to stop them from building some of their own hardware, warfare electronics in the present case, that is custom tailored to their own needs and, perhaps evenbetterthan what America could supply (and keep in mind, we probably don’t supply our best stuff to Israel, much less to Ukraine. _) Israel at minimum will have to recreate hardware we refuse to supply but for which they have stolen plans. Ultimately, they may have something better that they’ll probably not share with anyone, even us.Most of the above is speculation of course. Perhaps Israel truly doesn’t have advanced EW, radar etc. capacities relative to Iran. Maybe they did have to stand down their raid. Was the recent “leak” of Israel plans of real plans or clever disinformation?Please don’t get me wrong; I have no special love for the Zionists but anyone who underestimates their ingenuity will have their asses handed to them, as quite a few people in Gaza could attest.

                It’s a retarded theory any competent war planner would bust a chuckle at. If there were a faction in the Pentagon leans towards seeing that kind of war as a problem, it follows they see Israel as a rabid animal. That kind of conflagration would likely wipe Israel out before the US had time to react in the way Israel desires. Self-correcting problem.

                It flies under the radar mostly, but there have been numerous leaks from DOD of late, to your point, and charges have not always followed. A woman suspected of leaking to Iran over the last foray wastransferredrather than even suspended pending investigation. We live in an essentially totalitarian system now, so factionalism is all the rage. The factions at odds here seem to be Defense and State/IC.

            Unfortunately, the reverse is as likely to happen as not.Think Pearl Harbor, 1941 . . . . “surprise attack” and a disaster of the first order for the U.S. Navy.Why was the fleet at Pearl?Because FDR had insisted on putting there a year or so prior over the objections of the commanding admiral at the time.Without getting into the backdoor to war thesis, on the face of it, the public should have blamed the president for his incompetence, putting American sailors and soldiers in harms way.Instead, it was off to WWII.What happened to the admiral by the way?He was fired, before Pearl Harbor.What happen to FDR?Got re-elected for a forth time in 1944.

        The focus won’t be racism, but mostly sexism.  The childless cat ladies will be outraged and may focus part of their rage on black men if they don’t turn out for Kamala in high enough numbers.  My theory on her lagging numbers with black men is that she reminds them of the worst ex girlfriend they ever had.  I doubt the black vote even matters that much in key states, but these women are not rational about anything and are just looking for anyone else to blame.

            Living around NYC for decades, saw plenty of these. Long ago called them “DUBBs” Dried up bitter bitches.  They bought into the Cosmopolitan mag “you can have it all” myth and either waited too long and remained single or did end having kids late.  But had to subcontract raising them, messed the kids up, and were exhausted all the time.  Then eventually drove their husbands away and are alone, angry and with seriously screwed up offspring that don’t like them.

            Obama was the ideal black candidate because he was polished enough for black men to admire and safe enough for black women to view as a role model for their sons. He was their favorite actor, Denzel Washington, as a politician. Harris reminds black men of their baby momma and black women find her alien and false. Blacks will still vote 90-10 for her, but turnout will be much lower than typical. It will not matter all that much, outside of PA or MI, maybe.

                My favorite part of the election so far was when Former President Polly Prissy-Pants went out to lecture black men about voting for Kamala and coming across as “disappointed” in them because they wouldn’t vote for her.I saw the video and he was the most tin-eared I’ve ever heard him. It was like even HE didn’t believe what he was trying to sell. But it was all hectoring and I imagine the men he was talking to were fighting mightily NOT to roll their eyes. 🙄Between him and Michelle his wife nagging men to vote for Kamala, oh yeah, THAT’S a winning approach! 😒(Y’know, at some point ladies we just shut your voice out of our minds when you get wound up to nag us.)

            The cat ladies might think better of that plan and instead focus their anger on “Mormons” like they did after the gay marriage referendum didn’t pass in California (largely due to the high number of blacks and hispanics voting against it)

                It will be interesting to watch the “progressive stack” fall apart as the country’s planned “browning” proceeds. The media had generations to coax Whites into accepting all sorts of evil perversion, now including the idea that you simply cannot object to trannies going after your kids.The same elites who did that have seemingly spent all their time on just encouraging non-White migration willy-nilly. The result is that the incoming brown hordes have not been properly “trained” at all in the virtues of letting their women run wild and then watching their sons become women themselves. You see an especially disturbing and yet also hilarious example of this in Europe where the stupid White lefty women and faggy Eurotrash men are perpetually shocked when their pets install Sharia law wherever they predominate.Seemingly the only progressive values the incoming hordes sincerely embrace is a kind of primitive tribal socialism which just boils down to “more free shit for people who look like me”. This wouldn’t be a problem if they weren’t carelessly importing dozens of mutually antagonistic little hate groups who will start fighting over the gibs the moment they hit the ground.

                According to the 2020 exit poll 11% of Pennsylvania voters were black and they went 92-7 for Biden.  I don’t think the candidate split will change much, Trump might hit 10-12% and the percentage of the electorate might drop to 9-10%.  He needs to improve his share of the white vote to win the Rust Belt states.

        Dunning Kruger may be our only hope for the failure of globohomo’s burgeoning tyranny. If they can’t run basic utilities then they can’t very well impose an effective CBDC regime. Bearing this in mind, we should probably demand all the dieversity we can in the federal government. Does anyone have a more feasible or more effective idea of how it can be crippled?

        For the true believers it is about diversity. For the scheming misanthropes it is a patronage network and an enforcement network.This is about burning the ladders and shutting the doors. The country has been occupied for a long time. Now it is conquered. The, “diversity”, is a permeate satrapy designed to wall off any and every avenue to those who have been conquered.It is the failed leaders of the conquered who were so incompetent that they put themselves into this position and fell for such a stupid idea. Now some people who are extremely competent are going to move in and perpetuate and consolidate this permeate satrapy. Of course, they will struggle to contain the ethnic blow ups and squabbles and eventually fail. But, they will task second and third order minions with managing that and even use bots everywhere along with unprecedented tyranny. Still it will fail, but it could take a long long time. In the meantime, they will finish picking the carcass clean.

        I dunno, Z.I’m inclined to agree about declining competence… but a week or two back, I saw the first stage of a mighty rocket fall out of the skies, punch a hole in the clouds on the way down… and then stand on its tail, and gently lower itself on a column of flame back onto a gantry and shut down.It is my contention that technology like that may indeed allow the upcoming Artemis program to put diversity on the moon.Then you can beat on the bongos for me while I recite freestyle poetry about Blackie On Da Moon…😂

            If NASA does it, you can safely bet that they’ll get a non-white male to be the next one small step for (man)kind on the moon. My guess would be a black person or a white woman. I put $50 onJeanette J. Epps.If Elon does it, I can see him just picking the best individual(s).I think all the news about Elon’s rockets has discredited NASA, and you also have the ongoing discrediting of Boeing, the Armed Forces, and DEI in general. People see what great men can do, after a long period of media-created “great men” like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and John McCain.I’m not fawning over Elon but it’s cool to see ambitious men moving the needle again. Hopefully this will inspire others to plow through the decades of rot and funk and have fun doing so.

                    That set me laughing. Thank you. It also reminded me of the last seconds of the relatively recent Amazon jet crash with the diversity pilot trainee being screamed at too late by the white flight instructor “PULL UP! PULL UP!” That got me laughing again. I’m laughing as I’m writing thinking about it.

I might add here, NASA has extensive contracts with Musk for the latest “moon race” endeavors.  I’ve not pursued what they ask of Musk, but I suspect NASA needs help.

            Musk’s success at rocketry can be simply attributed to the fact that he refuses to kowtow to DEI in any fashion…of course he’s being sued, and doesn’t care…Musk hires the best he can get his hands on, pays them well, and most important, turns them loose….That used to be common in America, but now is a rarity….

            We’ve discussed this before, but bears mentioning again since your example is so often cited in discussion of declining intellect and ability.  People often use such examples to rebut those who claim we are declining as a first world technological society.The answer here lies in the theory of the “Smart Fraction” or what percentage of the population has to be at a level to keep this “shitshow” running.  Nothing in this theory states that intellectual decline affects all areas of the country equally.  So we see a Musk can attract the talent he needs, whereas Boeing declines to mediocrity and failure to keep doors on its planes.  Of course, DIE is a confounding effect, but nonetheless does not change (exasperates?) the problem.

Machines can make your Big Mac, keep you driving between the lines, park your car, remember the phone numbers of all your friends etc etc ad nauseum.If we can put monkeys like Shitavius and Tyrone on the moon, surely we can make machines to either replace him or supervise him on the factory line?

        The Dunning-Kruger thing requires one key system feature: no short-term feedback loop. Foreign policy failure – total military hegemony to enforce our will. Financial failure – reserve currency printing, endless bailouts and welfare. Educational failure – confer worthless degrees and forgive student loans. Societal failure – SSRIs, pot, narcotics to numb the hopeless masses. Of course, eventually thermodynamics assert themselves.

        ‘Julie Chávez Rodriguez no doubt looks in the morning each morning and sees a world bestriding figure, when in reality she is a hapless simpleton’America has to replace tens of millions of white male boomers who are semi-competent to maintain national infrastructure and techno-creative potential.What the nation has replacements are gazillions of three-named empowered wimmin.  Julie Chavez Rodriguez and Kammie Harris are prime examples of government-by-snowflake that is the modern American Deep State.  Bureaucracy is over-run with fifty years of increasingly empowered princesses, few of whom are fit to replace the white male boomers they have degraded, toxified and overthrown.As allies, they’ve imported fifty million young foreign males to spice up sexual competition and pressure, and to cover up their disenfranchisement of generations of white males in favor of Everything for Princess.Precious Snowflake now must pack and hump the weight of running the empire, and they are inadequate and inept in every way except for Self-Esteem proficiency.Neither political party will so much as recognize this as a problem, much less correct it by shifting from a feminist society to a masculine culture.

                Yes I’ve been reading about JCC’s attitude toward illegals. Of course if he was still around he’d have to do a 180 or face oblivion. I remember in the mid-2000s, seeing, I believe it was the Sierra Club, which had always opposed more immigration, being harangued into “seeing the light”, and dropping their opposition. So much for the environment…

                    The whale donor of the Sierra Club became an open borders fanatic with a predictable early life, so the thinking evolved. I would hazard a guess that AGW is no longer as big of a thing since it conflicts with mass migration, which is the endgame.

        The toll that diversity has taken at my company is immeasurable.  I have to be honest though, my company doesn’t make it as bad as others.  I have a rule that deletes all of the “culture” emails before I see them.  I do not attend any “all hands” meetings as they are simply a “white people bad” seminar.  We have a chief diversity officer, a fat Shaniqua who has been in the racket since the early 2000s.  So far all that she has done to earn her 450k per year salary is not allow us to use “ladies and gentleman” in any form.  I shit you not – this is 100% real.I work on a small US team of developers who is 100% male and White.  Not even kidding.  We’ve tried to hire “diversity” but it has not worked out at all.  One black guy we hired lasted 3 months and he was fired because he did nothing.  He kept making up stories that he had a sick father or something or other.  He was caught by management in a lie and he couldn’t explain it and even admitted it.  That was it.  10 lines of code in 3 months from this guy.  Next up was an Indian software “architect”.  He lasted 3 months too.  Lied about his resume, and couldn’t produce a single line of code.  Nothing…  There were a few more as well and the result was the same.Some of the younger millennials we have are also amazing.  They all work from home and simply require a computer, phone and internet to do 100% of their jobs.  The amount of times these pussies call in “sick” is remarkable.  Even when i have been “sick”, I’m still able to work.  You can work from your fucking bed for crying out loud.  Everything about them screams fragility, and they complain incessantly about something they aren’t getting that they feel they are entitled to.  I find them to be the worst generation this former country has ever produced.A guy I worked with at one of my former tech companies has lasted in the industry for 20 years.  He’s a retard – probably 85-90 IQ at the very best.  He’s black, of course, and we used to call him “The Rock”.  He always thought it was an endearing term – as in “The Rock” is super solid!”, but in reality, it was because he was as dumb as a rock.  Maybe even more so.  He got promoted at his current company to a director level over a straight White guy who also applied for the position.  I know him too, and he’s probably in the 130 IQ range and was really good.  Of course they gave it to the retard, and the retard did one smart thing – he immediately hired the smart White guy to do all of the work to make him look good.  This is the new way of things.

        Good essay.The proposed peace agreement in Ukraine must have also been cooked up by a simpleton.The Secretary of State landing in the Middle East in a war in which the United States should seek peace and then declaring himself a Jew first is the act of a simpleton.Alowing a person from the board of the Hebrew Aid Society promoting importing refugees into the United States to be in charge of the security for very border of the United States is the act of simpletons.The list of the acts of simpletons never ends in the 21st century.United Simpletons of America.USA!

        “Handing power to entitled stupid people brimming with unearned confidence is playing with fire.”
That’s a keeper.
My wife’s medical group is floundering financially because the schedulers can’t competently schedule patients.  The company does big time-and-motion studies to try and figure out why their patient throughput is so low.
Exasperated, last week, my wife came home and detailed how managers scrutinized every tiny step in the process.  Every tiny step, save one.
Guess which one?
I’ll give you three guesses why, but you’ll only need one.
The company would rather go bankrupt than confront this reality.

        On the subject of campaign incompetence, I’ve been kind of amazed at how ridiculously out-of-touch Harris’ ads are with the actual campaign being run by Trump. A few weeks ago they started up with a bunch of “tax breaks for the rich” ads because Trump’s a “billionaire” don’t you know. Even setting aside the fact that they’ve been painting Trump as a failure in business lying about his wealth for the past 8+ years, Trump has said absolutely nothing about tax cuts. It’s the kind of ad that might have made sense in 1980 during the Reagan/Carter campaign but means nothing today. Next they were claiming Trump wanted a national sales tax! I couldn’t even figure out what the hell they were talking about until I realized they were trying to criticize raising tariffs. I don’t believe for a minute that even the most politically aware had any idea what the ads were supposed to be about. Now they’re going with ads claiming Trump wants to slash Social Security. Again that might have been relevant in 2000 when Bush was running, but Trump quite consciously never goes near that issue except to say he’ll never touch it. It really seems like the campaign’s DEI hires just went back into the Dem HQ archives to randomly choose ads from the past and just reran them.

        The biggest problem with elected politics is the overwhelming presence of lawyers running for office. These mouthpieces have the gift of gab and an enormous ego, but no real experience running anything. We could happily trade 30 lawyers in power for 30 engineers and tradesmen.The goal of a harmonious society should not only be to maintain the status quo but to improve things. Lawyers improve nothing. They are troublemakers and busibodies, honing their skills like wasps.It should be noted that both Lenin and Castro were professional lawyers in a peasant country. Setting a lawyer to run an economy is like setting a plumber to run a university symposium. The results are hilariously tragic.I’m frankly surprised that countries like Canada and the U.S. don’t have more businessmen candidates running for office. Many entrepreneurs came up from sales and that’s even more gift-of- the-gab than lawyering.An assembly of businessmen, coders and electricians would be more likely to do something about the debt, if nothing else. Their practical experience could only help.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

        Handing power to entitled stupid people brimming with unearned confidence is playing with fire.Hence, Ukraine and being forced to the brink of nuclear war. The people in today’s Pentagon and State Department would have been hard-pressed to be middle managers only a generation ago, but today they assure us mushroom clouds are overrated. Women and Incompetents of Color loom large in their ranks.I disagree with you that there will be doubling down if Harris loses, which seems possible. In fact, her vapidity and incompetence will provide a chunk of the elite the cover to move past DEI on moral grounds. If she loses, or, to be precise, Trump is allowed to win, DEI will have permitted Orange Satan to rule again and must end! This possible destruction of DEI also will prompt a lot more fortification, to be clear, although much of TPTB may not participate in it this time.As for Dunning-Kruger, anyone who has had the misfortune to interact with a DEI hire realizes one reality: the more the incompetent the person, the more certitude xhe has of their superiority. And the more incompetent the DEI hire, the more the whites who promoted xher play act they are in the presence of genius. Blacks are the worst, and were so even before DEI, so we have the likes of Ibram X. Kendi,nee’Henry Rogers, who may be functionally illiterate but is convinced of his literary pretensions since, after all, William Shakespeare was a secret negro. The problem is the white women who have convinced themselves that to be true, and the remaining sanity in Corporate America is chomping at the bit to put an end to that gynotardation. Godspeed.

            Perhaps D-K Effect is not quite appropriate for our DIE and AA folk.  Is such hubris as to one’s competence and ability simply the result of stupidity, or a lifetime of indoctrination fueled by wokism?  Imagine being told every setback one experiences is not one’s own fault, but due to racism of one sort or another and then coming up through a system that evaluates you differently and allows you to be passed “up the ladder” regardless of your ability.

It is definitely both. A non-white who can vomit out a coherent sentence, no matter their intelligence, is viewed by a Wokie as a sage. The stupid non-white comes to believe it. That’s a pretty vicious cricle.

        This is definitely at play in Hollywood. Bob Iger’s pet Board chair was dumped for a guy from Morgan Stanley, a big Elon Musk fan. Musk is bankrolling Gina Carano’s lawsuit against Disney which is in Discovery phase as a retaliation for Disney’s labeling X as racist, etc.The reason is Disney is bleeding money with no respite in sight. While Blackrock and State Street and Vanguard are fine with losing money to send the message, the rest of Wall Street is not and Disney has heavy, heavy debt. Murdoch Sr. was astute enough to have Fox News generate $1 billion in profits every year to neatly cover his debt payments. Disney has no such cash flow: the parks are in decline, favorite rides of its aging customer base demolished for “intersectional” black/gay rides, etc. Star Wars is still in the red (lots of initial revenue for the three movies under Disney, but costs ate up most of that — the other stuff has been money losing and even more fan alienating). Marvel has not had a hit since 2019 Endgame, and Deadpool/Wolverine are a Ryan Reynolds one-off that Feige hates and notably there is not another scheduled.Iger can’t and won’t change course: he has political ambitions still, needs the approbation of Hollywood, and loves the message. He owns almost no stock btw.Thus there is no common culture. Youtube videos dissecting the utter trash that Hollywood makes generate more views than the trash itself. There is also the revolt of the counter-elite.Silicon Valley has AI ambitions. That require lots of reliable power, hence the push to nuclear. NO WAY the alliance of cool wine AWFLs, Soros radicals, Obama machine people, and the like allow lots of nuke plants to make dudes in Silicon Valley rich. Meanwhile the Pentagon is counting on AI to provide an advantage over Russia and China.We are already seeing the clash between DEI religion, and Wall Street, SV, and the Pentagon. It will only get worse.

            The slow death of cable tv is really what’s killing Disney’s bottom line, since Eisner married Disney’s fortunes to cable 30 or 40 years ago and nobody has come up with a new plan since then, or at least not a good one. (Iger’s outwardly successful tenure just riding Eisner’s coattails). Parks haven’t been a growth business in many years and movies have always been hit or miss. Indeed, the problems plaguing Disney’s movie business are hardly exclusive to it, those problems are Hollywood wide. It was the formerly burgeoning cable business that propelled Disney in the modern era, until it didn’t. Unless somebody comes up with a new strategy it will continue its slow decline into extinction.

        So off topic, I was at the humane society last weekend and noticed something interesting.  As a white guy walking past the dogs they just would come up to the bars and give me the sad eyes, but when a white woman came in with a small group of niglets  all the dogs just started going ballistic and barking their heads off.A few walks in with my new little precious princess I’ve already detected a simple path to the ethnostate that gets around civil rights.  Now this dog is an extroverted Siberian Husky who never bites or gets aggressive and all the white people I come across just adore her, yet all the hispanics I’ve passed will either ignore her or give me a dirty look.  I think they’re afraid of dogs, my theory being that the beast races only get vicious dogs to keep in their yards so they react with fear assuming the white man’s dog is similarly there to bite their corrupted brown flesh.I think just having a dog-based HOA would be the path to having a pure neighborhood, blacks and hispanics dislike dogs just like the muzzies in Sweden were afraid of trees.

            Generally, dogs belonging to negros will hate whites, just as dogs belonging to whites hate negros.The famous South African Boerboel, one of the world’s great guard dogs, is trained thusly: When a puppy, it is placed in a sack that is tied to a tree limb. A negro is paid to beat it with a stick. This is repeated for several days. Henceforth the dog, which knows the negro by his smell, hates negros forever. When visiting friends in South Africa, I was greeted warmly by their (HUGE) and friendly boerboels, and I would say “some guard dog,” to which they would reply, “well, you’re the right color.”Last I checked it is kind of a pain to import one into AINO

                How did the Picts keep the Romans out of Scotland?War hounds. Before their front line berserkers went into battle, they’d line up 500 war hounds and say, “Sic ’em, boy”.Also, I didn’t know wolf hounds were still a thing. They still exist! I saw pictures from the 1890s of wolf hounds…they are literally 8 feet tall, when standing, and like Great Danes, as tall or taller than their trainers on all fours. (I once felt breathing on my neck, and turned around to find a couple GD’s staring at me eye-to-eye. They came with bikers to Sturgis, back when it was real.)Those wolf hounds are thick and massive, like St. Bernard’s. They were bred to grab up a wolf in their jaws and shake him, breaking his spine, as a terrier does a rat. Just some ideas for our future white fiefdoms.

        The Harris campaign is in flailing mode, desperately reaching for anything shiny enough to distract away from their inept candidate. She is like the beauty pageant who when asked her most important issue, she’ll reply, “world peace, or ending world hunger.”A vacuous person who began her political career on the arm of SF political heavy Willie Brown, she was introduced to the right people at important dinner parties, who then utilized her as a front for their own interests.Imagine getting picked as a VP for Harris so you can make her look smarter. That’s not an achievement. Walz was selected because any Dem with brains knew better than to hitch their ambitions to this dumpster fire of a ticket.

            Walz is the perfect example of “rising to their level of incompetence” aka “The Peter Principle”.Tampon Tim worked fine as long as he stayed in Minnesota. He fits in with the “You Betcha” Socialist Germans and liberal Scrowegians that populate that state. After all, whoreallylooks at the Governor of a state that’s not New York or California? Sure, Florida and Texas have Governors that have made their names in the public sphere, and Michigan and Illinois have self-promoting governors who don’t understand The Streisand Effect when they seek publicity, but Minnesota? Where it’s cold all around?So Tim takes the big stage and Good Lord was the man outmatched. In Minnesota people overlook the dude’s a big bumbling doofus since he’s Democrat and Socialist you betcha! Problem is people OUTSIDE of Minnesota saw him and as they say “Uff Da!”He’s the perfect pairing with Kamala because everything they say or do makes us cringe.

                “Walz is the perfect example of “rising to their level of incompetence” aka “The Peter Principle”.”
If I remember correctly, according to that principle you rise to your level of incompetence and stay there because it can be seen you’re incompetent at that level. But today, you keep getting promoted regardless of how incompetently you’re doing your current job.Walz was incompetent as governor but no problem making him a VP candidate. Other examples abound. What matters today is your attitude and image and performance be damned.

                The “Peter Principle” made quite a splash in the 70’s, but does it hold up today?  Remember, in the 70’s there was no DEI, no AA.  Folks did indeed work in corporate American of the time and rose through the ranks as employees based upon their achievement record in their position. (Yes, there are always exceptions—such as nepotism.  But in the main…)Now comes along AA, followed by DIE, and such evaluation of achievement is no longer pertinent wrt hiring/promotion.  The employee wears his “achievement” rather than earns it. I maintain that today more often than not, there is no rising to one’s level of incompetence as the individual was *always* incompetent—unless your sole criteria for employment was to a “fog a mirror”!To this effect, I give you our current presidential candidate, Harris.  An empty vessal, if there ever was one.  A century ago, she’d never have been in any elevated position other than menial labor and most likely relegated to mother and home maker—which I assume she’d be competent at.  That’s to AA and DIE and wokism, there are millions of Harris’s among us.

        Much has been written in these parts about the crisis of competence that is creepy up on all aspects of life like the fog. Every day, competent people are aging out and being replaced by people who lack the competence.This is the reason why many who hate the boomers so much right now will come to regret their attitudes in time. Despite their shortcomings, and they are many, the boomers as a generation were generally competent and had a decent work ethic in whatever fields of endeavor they went into. Their replacements, by and large, do not. This is likely to be the single biggest issue affecting our society over the next few decades.

        Some of the incompetence is feigned, like with my PCP. I had my annual physical yesterday. He came in wearing a mask. He’s a white man, gen X. He’s pretty sharp though. He’s not really incompetent, but fakes it to keep in the good graces I suspect. He asked me about the atorvastin (again) that he prescribes but I ignore. He’s always worried about my cholesterol. I told him I don’t take statins. He giggled and said that explains my cholesterol. My bro’s doc told my bro to get out of his office for not taking some vitamin he recommended. He flat-out fired my bro for not taking his advice. My doc doesn’t do that. Worth his weight in gold.We talked about shoes. He was admiring my Clarks. He said he has wide feet so has trouble getting good shoes. I’ve had this pair of Clarks for over ten years. He said something about Ozempic and I said I don’t watch those commercials. He seemed relieved that I wasn’t going to hector him about Ozempic. I am a little overweight but if it’s all the rage in Hollywood, I’m not buying it. I’m suspicious of simple solutions. He asked me about my diet and I said it’s mostly meat but I’ll eat a well-cooked vegetable now and then. He giggled and said that was fine as long as I’m not eating Hungry Man exclusively. He mumbled through all the vaccines I’m supposed to be getting and I mumbled something that he didn’t bother to enter into the computer.We parted on good terms, again. Fake compliance that may look like incompetence is sometimes a good thing. I’m aware that this is the only way a white man can survive in today’s clownish simulacrum of a society. I’m glad that I don’t have an arrogant Dunning-Krueger for a PCP.

        As I recall, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager in 2016 was a homosexual. He was really someone who could connect with the masses.

            A very recent complaint about Democrat campaign managers was that they couldn’t find any straight white guys, so they had to go outside.

        One interesting angle to the Trump-Rogan beef is that Rogan is terminally a Boston Southie, whereas Trump is literally the personification of 1980s NYC.
That said, and maybe I’m reading the situation wrong, but I feel like the Trump-Rogan beef is a bit oversold.
They’ve been at mixed martial arts events in the past, they must’ve had some brief conversations at those.

            Way oversold.  Non-existant and fake, like most Leftist campaigns.  Rogan and Trump promo’d the interview with a dual cameo at a UFC event.

        Another good essay. Technically, Z is repeating the popular yet not completely correct view of Dunning-Kruger. Yes, it’s usually applied to the case that a dumb fuck overestimates his competence in a given field; indeed that’s the safe way to bet when dealing with virtually any Democrat or Progressive organization’s staff picks.However, the formal theory says nothing about a person’sintelligence, the definition only requires that a person have a misperception of competencein a particular field or specialty. In most cases probably it’s to over-estimate one’s abilities, but it could also be a person under-estimating his knack at something.
