        The disfiguration of America is striking. In the 80s it was the suburb, the suburban strip mall, the shopping mall/galleria, and the mega church. Now that is decaying and you have a mass human disfigurement.
It is absolutely striking to see TGR and its disfigurement of the population itself. In some areas you can drive vast distances and not see a single American ‚Äì a person who looks like you.
It makes Starbucks, Little Caesar‚Äôs and Taco Bell happy.
Disfigurement. That is the legacy of the Regime on The Potomac.

        ‚ÄúOf course, no one dares talk about is replacing those baby boomers in the workplace.‚ÄùCome now.  We all know those thieving Boomers will be rightfully replaced by those Millennials and Zoomers whom they wrongfully displaced through dint/luck of birth cohort.  Right?Wrong.  The Boomers were overwhelmingly White and the powers that be have decided to replace them with a non-White demographic‚Äîa demographic woefully not up to such a monumental task as extending a 1st world technological society such as they were given.The Boomers will all be dead and gone in 20 years.  Gen X‚Äôers will mask the decline, some early Millenials will cushion the collapse, but in the end it will be for nought.  50 years from now, historians will understand and note our self induced destruction.

            Compsci-Good points, I just slightly disagree with your timeline.I feel as though we are already seeing significant declines in the workforce due to Boomers and early Xers retiring or being forced out of the workforce via ageism.I think this will accelerate as all the Boomers cycle out of the workforce because X is a numerically smaller generation and the relative quality of our education was less than that of the Boomers and other prior generation.I write this as a very late Xer. I‚Äôd like to be able to argue that my generation will somehow turn things around and create a new Golden Age in the West, but I look around and I just don‚Äôt see it.

                What concerns me is that as the Silents and Boomers (and Millenials) pass, so goes the deep talent pool of knowing how to do things from scratch. There‚Äôll be nobody left to teach the next generations how to bootstrap or even do anything.

                    We have YouTube as a great repository of human knowledge until some future 28 year old MBA at Google decides that maintaining 50 year old video files that no one watches is too expensive and has them deleted.

                Howard, can‚Äôt argue with you there.  My weakness is being an overly optimistic sort wrt my dire predictions. üòâ
The declining education system was a good catch.  In these matters of prognostication there are any number of confounding factors.  Your observation, educational decline, might be ameliorated by AI as such unfolds in the current decade.  Who knows?

            It‚Äôs interesting that the Harvard Bus School MBA program currently runs a teaching case study on the decline of Boeing ‚Äì with a grand reveal that Boomer accountants and top management *a quarter century ago* are directly responsible for the lethal decline of a once gold standard aviation company.Nothing is dare said in class (and the teaching notes make no mention of it) about the loss and marginalization of pale, stale and male Boomer engineers and their replacement by vibrant DEI quota ‚Äútalent‚Äù.Thus one of the *real* teaching and learning take-aways is a strong validation of Z-Man‚Äôs Expectations Gap concept.

                Yep.  Recently speaking to an old friend I went to school with (50 years ago and just reunited) who is familiar with Boeing‚Äôs quality control decline.  Oddly, he could not lay his finger on the cause of the problem until I pointed out demographic changes and DIE initiatives out to him.  He has not stopped talking about such since.  It was a revelation.  This guy is bright, yet blinded because no one he interacts with dared be the first to ‚Äúcross that line‚Äù.

            I happened to go in a Verizon office yesterday for a phone problem. The staff were  young people, mostly non-white, heavily pierced and tattooed,a few of the men effeminate-looking and all dressed in very unbusinesslike, casual, almost scruffy clothing (their equivalents are everywhere). We Boomers are leaving the country to a generation of pitiable Sad Sacks.

                ‚ÄúWe Boomers‚Äù largely welcomed in our progeny‚Äôs replacements with open arms in the name of luv and equality.  ‚ÄúWe Boomers‚Äù are considerably less likely than Millennials to gift any of ‚Äúour‚Äù money to our own children during our lifetimes.  Too busy spending it and ‚Äòliving our best lives‚Äô to think about future generations.  ‚ÄúWe Boomers‚Äù are a prime example of short-time preferences.  The fact that Boomers tend to be White and better educated is a legacy from earlier generations ‚Äì one we squandered.  Those ‚Äúpitiable Sad Sacks‚Äù are the result of ‚ÄúWe Boomers‚Äù preoccupation with ourselves.

                    No argument here, but a bit of a clarification/addition‚Äîfor what it‚Äôs worth.This ‚ÄúBoomer‚Äù married another Boomer who also has three degrees.  We Boomers put our children into private schools as soon as the public ones revealed their true nature.  We Boomers put our children through university while 1) approving the major and university, and 2) requiring that both children work while going to school in order to pay their share, which actually was about the total cost if one considers the scholarships they received.The result.  Two offspring who graduated with honors, no debt, and walked immediately into 6 figure jobs‚Äîboth marrying similar spouses.  In short, the children laugh when we chide them about cutting them out of our will or leaving them nothing.  Now the bad part‚Ä¶We failed them, but they don‚Äôt know it yet.  With luck, we‚Äôll be dead before they know such.  How?  We gave them things‚Äîmaterial things‚Äîand thought we did well to do so.  But we had one thing given us that I now realize was something they did not receive, and what was the most valuable thing that could be given‚Ä¶a spiritual upbringing in a faith community.Materialism distracted wife and I from the one thing all parents, rich or poor, can give.  That I‚Äôm sure will be my final regret when my time comes to an end here.

                        No, Compsci, we must break from those hidden chains and forge anew. They are too easily swayed, buoyed by the illusion of belonging to a past that never was.
You have done them a service; I suspect that your decency was intrinsic, not learned from an artifice. That is the true heritage you have given them.
The purpose of the system is the System. Christianity was such a vessel, but having been turned, is become social gospel and messianic projection. It could not keep up with the modernized environment.

                    Exactly 3g4me. This ‚Äúhooray for boomers‚Äù circlejerk going on in this thread is a little nauseating. It certainly wasn‚Äôt the face tattooed 20somethings that sold the country‚Äôs patrimony to China in order to buy themselves a 40 foot RV to cruise in with their 3rd spouse. As someone just barely old enough to know what they missed out on, I say that today‚Äôs youth deserve pity far more than scorn, they don‚Äôt even know what they could have had.Vox day is a huge clown, but he isn‚Äôt wrong about the boomers and their infinite self-regard. For some reason that generation thinks being handed the keys to history‚Äôs wealthiest empire and leaving their grandchildren a smoking crater is something to celebrate.

                        What is nauseating is this total cluelessness. As a group, Boomers had less to do with selling out to China than you do with the border jumpers.
Boomers had no right to tell people what they could and could not do with their own stuff. While we were not happy with it, legally and morally, it was not our call.
Gen Z is a larger cohort than Boomer. Millennials are only a bit smaller. Why can‚Äôt they stop the migrants? This is legally and morally their call.

        ‚ÄòThe American economy is experiencing what happened in the 1970‚Äôs.‚ÄôBut America is a vastly different country today than in the Seventies.  I drove around the western U.S. before I left the nation, for an evaluation.  I saw an utterly transformed country.  Shops boarded up everywhere, litter all over the avenues, crazies wandering around.Tent-cities everywhere . . . streets full of men cast away in the 50-year pogrom to replace them en masse in education and employment with The Empowered Ones.  Replacing an 80 million-strong productive workforce with an unproductive and entitled workforce has consequences.  That isn‚Äôt about retiring the old U.S. economy and plugging in ‚ÄòAbenomics‚Äô.  It‚Äôs a collectivist (and demonic) social mandate that guarantees the destruction of the nation.Yet that policy is wildly popular with the international elites, women, and the parents of daughters.  That is a guaranteed demographic time-bomb that is ignored at peril, yet is embraced not only by Progs, but also by ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô and Christians.  It is a wildly popular suicide.Likewise, the Biden Administration made it clear all along that their aim ‚Äî actually, the NWO elite aim ‚Äî WAS to gut the economy and the nation as a whole in order to ‚ÄòBuild Back Better‚Äô.  Because racism and sexism and homophobia.  They wished to utterly destroy the nation so that a more egalitarian, globalist system could replace it.  It‚Äôs difficult to make an economy function when the stated aim of the government and its bankster handlers is to ensure it DOESN‚ÄôT function.‚ÄòThe Trump plan is to restructure the economy, which will require massive spending and a considerable amount of pain.‚ÄôMight help short-term, but doesn‚Äôt solve the problem, because finagling the numbers and systems does not address the real issues in New Amerika.  It‚Äôs just more scamming and showtime.

            I live near San Diego, CA, which likes to bill itself as ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs finest city.‚Äù The decline of the city has been striking, with many of the signs of decline you cited. Not coincidentally, what used to be a Republican stronghold is now dominated by Democrats. They hold three of the four congressional seats in the county, all of the seats on the San Diego city council (and the mayor is a homosexual to boot) and a majority on the County Board of Supervisors.  That board recently voted to make the county a sanctuary county. Fortunately, the county sheriff said she has no intention of implementing any sanctuary  policies in her department and will continue to cooperate with immigration authorities.

            Quite right. No-one trusts the dollar to be a stable repository of purchasing power. Probably not a single person here does. Holding dollars or dollar-denominated paper such as T-bills is to watch your purchasing power erode away like a sand castle to an incoming tide. But the empire needs others to want to accept dollars in exchange for hard goods. And this can perhaps only be done (and that too only in the short term) by an escalating level of violence. This is the crazy and desperate logic of a hollowed-out empire.

                    Right?There are too many wealthy Chinese hoovering up real estate in the West to make anyone feel comfortable holding their wealth there.Then you have the Euro. No one is going to trust a currency backed by a federation where the government of Germany, the key power, just collapsed.On top of that, that key power is rapidly de-industrializing because it insists on trying to function using the most expensive and unreliable forms of energy. No one with any financial sense is buying into that.No one in the West will trust Russia and the ruble because there are too many bad memories of the Soviet times. All the sanctions and being locked out of SWIFT do not help either.Adjacent to that, intentional or not, the recent debacle in Syria just caused a huge hit to Russia and the momentum that BRICS had built in recent months.Like it or not, the fall of Assad has created a big perception problem for Putin and team. The ongoing quagmire in Ukraine isn‚Äôt helping either.

                        It‚Äôs not just trust in the various other currencies/govts. There‚Äôs also the issue of a deep bond market.If investors, businesses, banks and central banks want to hold your currency to use later, they need someplace stable and liquid to hold that currency, something that they can sell in an instant with no loss to obtain that currency. That‚Äôs T-bills.China doesn‚Äôt even have a govt bond market for foreigners. Germany‚Äôs govt bond market is tiny ‚Äì and the Euro is tied to other countries beyond Germany. Japan, are you kidding me. Russia‚Äôs not even in the discussion.Btw, it‚Äôs not just that other countries can‚Äôt challenge the US dollar; it‚Äôs that they don‚Äôt want to challenge the dollar. They know what having global reserve currency does to your economy. It de-industrializes it. They don‚Äôt want that.

I don‚Äôt recall you stating this point so starkly before.
Is resigning from being the global reserve currency a necessary prerequisite for re-industrialization of the USA?
If Trump decided to follow your economic advice, do you have any to give?

                                U.S. labor (and for that matter, all ‚Äúrich‚Äù nations‚Äô) is horribly expensive by world standards. This is probably the major factor that so many jobs ‚Äúwent overseas‚Äù in recent decades. Firms in the third world don‚Äôt need to obey silly environmental, pollution, workplace safety, etc. regulations either. That (and tariffs) is why an avocado that costs you $2.00 in San Diego can be had at a fraction of that price just south of the border. In the 1990s when I was in my early 30s studying Computer Science, when I was in a sarcastic mood I would ‚Äúshare with‚Äù the younger students ‚ÄúThere are people in India and Pakistan with advanced CS degrees who speak fluent English, who work for about one-tenth the U.S. wage scale.‚Äù Needless to say I wasn‚Äôt very well received. Nevertheless, I think that statement was broadly true and probably even truer three decades later.Anyway, what factor(s) would make U.S. Labor, and therefore U.S. manufacturing more attractive overall? Simple: a vast decline in the real cost of a U.S. worker. That could be accomplished by a deflation, or similarly by massive inflation that reduced his real wage cost. If this realignment happens, it might well put the entire economy through the wringer probably on a scale of the Great Depression.

I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not true. I know of no inherent characteristic of a reserve currency that inexorably leads to deindustrialization. It didn‚Äôt happen to any degree for at least the first 20 years of Bretton-Woods.
On the other hand, it does decouple the immediate consequences from the action of profligate spending. People used to empiricism can be tempted with stupid ideas like ‚Äúdeficits don‚Äôt matter‚Äù or ‚Äúinvite the world‚Äù.

                            Terrorism is a good asymmetrical weapon for weak players to use against stronger ones. I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of what ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù** does against Russia that makes headlines pretty much falls into the category of terrorism or comes damn close. Recall that group of drones they sent to attack some buildings in Moscow. They did some damage but nothing significant. The whole point seems to have been to get a propaganda victory. Then you‚Äôve got their love of assassinations using bombs like when they killed Dugin‚Äôs daughter and now this latest hit on the official mentioned at ZH. You might even look at the assassination of Soleimani in Iran as the start of this trend.The US has certainly done assassinations before but I suspect this may be a major shift in the focus of its military strategies using ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù as the cats paw to test out this new scheme. If this is true it‚Äôs a clever way to pivot away from trying to intimidate the world with Wunderwaffen which the Ukraine war has shown to be less than ‚Äúwunder‚Äù. Imagine if our trillion dollar MIC were to pivot more towards ‚Äúpersonalized war‚Äù (facial recognition drones, smart bullets, designer viruses created for just one person or a small tribe).** I‚Äôm putting ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù in quotes because we all know that Ukraine has about as much sentience and agency as ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù does.

                        I think this might identify the unspoken question about Bitcoin.The coin people and Trump backers (it seems) are are pumping Bitcoin and private ‚Äòstablecoins‚Äô as the big new thing.
Whitney Webb warns that CBDC is unnecessary; the governments are shifting to managerial class privately generated stablecoin because it is already mature, established, and just as trackable and programmable (restrictable) as cbdc. Also, it has that unaccountable public-private vibe one finds in NGOs.
As Citizen points out, there is no deep, liquid bond market for international settlement in Bitcoin. Banks, business, forex couldn‚Äôt operate as they do now.

                            Currencies have always been backed by governments since the first coins were minted in the 8th century, B.C.. Because of this, I have been skeptical of Bitcoin-type currencies that bill themselves as free of government control.

                                If those coins were made of gold, silver, and heck even copper, they still have value (ignoring sometimes astonishing numismatic premium) whether a government minted them last year, two centuries or two millennia ago. Their value was effectively set by the free market, not by government edict.

                    ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no other choice than the dollar (and thus treasuries) ‚Äì at least for now. Name me a currency that is better than the dollar. Name me a govt bond that is in the same universe in terms of liquidity as t-bills.‚ÄùThis is all correct but it‚Äôs not a choice between one crud fiat currency and some other crud fiat currency. It‚Äôs an issue of getting out of fiat altogether, whether dollar, euro, or yen. Hard assets ‚Äî land, gold ‚Äî and something hopefully impervious to state confiscation. I would assume (but don‚Äôt really know) that wanting to get out of national fiat currencies is part of the allure of crypto.A little thought experiment on my part as I muse aloud. Suppose I inherited ten billion in liquid US dollars. What would I do with it? Well, I wouldn‚Äôt keep it in cash or treasuries (beyond some minimum amount). I would make large purchases of land elsewhere in the world, hopefully far away from the greedy maw of the US empire and its satellites. I would buy large amounts of precious metals, again hopefully outside the orbit of the empire. I would renounce US citizenship as fast as possible so that the minions of the empire couldn‚Äôt hold me over a barrel. And it goes without saying I‚Äôd be out of the USA, and outside the ‚ÄúWestern empire‚Äù. also as fast as possibleIf these options were closed to me, then what? I would play the game of capitalism the way Musk is. Because today the conjoining of capitalism and state power is closer than ever. It‚Äôs crony capitalism at the top and decay and stagnation elsewhere. These are my thoughts as I muse aloud.

                    I have to agree. In fact, I had lost sight of the economic picture with regards to Syria, but it is a perfect example of how the financial kingpins of this world periodically sow chaos from the Acela corridor. They have no other tool when things look dire for the existing international financial arrangements than to sow chaos in the rest of the world. That eventually starts a flight to the dollar in order to buy U.S. debt, the ‚Äúdirtiest shirt in the hamper‚Äù. It has always worked before (but of course someday it won‚Äôt.)

                        Syria, and many other troubled countries, will continue to economically function, albeit poorly, because their transactional exchanges will involve other currencies like the dollar and euro.  This is how Zimbabwe‚Äôs populace survives.

                    Collectible surveillance. The most dystopian currency imaginable.
The teenage Randians among us don‚Äôt carewhat it is.They just enjoy the thought of other people being ripped off, losers and haters missing out, etc. They‚Äôll give upeverythingfor that feeling.

            Exactly.  Once my adopted nation heard the Fed‚Äôs Build Back Better agenda (we have to destroy ourselves in order to create a More Just World) and saw America intentionally ruining itself via the Scamdemic, they jumped off the Dollar Train. Fast. I guess folks have forgotten the forced closure of hundreds-of-thousands of small businesses because, uh, Covidemic.
Thus, the dollar began a years-long tanking here, because what sane nation would place any amount of trust in a country that has announced ‚Äî overtly and covertly ‚Äî that it wishes to die?

            The debt wouldn‚Äôt be that big of a deal if our GDP was real.  Problem is, the GDP is bullshit. Nov 2024 was a 76.1 billion trade deficit.  I doubt we have had a single positive balance of trade number in this century yet.  The national debt has grown every single year since 1963.There are all these articles and videos from the usual suspects about how Americans are so uninformed because despite everyone complaining about the economy, the US economy according to GDP is doing great.What are you going to believe, your lying eyes and purse or the BLS?

        There was a video floating around X the other day where some woman with a wonderful Canadian lilt was giving Trudeau the business during a town hall for selling Canada out to the globalists. Trudeau ‚Äì to his credit?? ‚Äì seemed obsequious. Just a few years ago, he was yelling at the same types saying ‚ÄúMadame, vous √™tes raciste!‚ÄùThen of course a few weeks back Starmer in the UK basically apologized for immigration. I haven‚Äôt heard anything out of Australia yet, but those bloody c*nts had better get their act together, soon. It‚Äôs a shame about Australians, because they were the most ornery and irreverent English speakers I knew when I lived abroad.But nice seeing such a big vibe shift in the Anglosphere. Almost miraculous. There haven‚Äôt been this  many white pills since 1924.

His finance minister, the woman who terrorized protesters awhile back, resig-fired in a bitchy letter to the PM.
Turdeau is trying to prevent the collapse of his leftist government as happened in France and Germany.

                Australia is much like Texas in that it coasts on a reputation that ceased to be reality long, long ago. Australia has been largely urbanized most of its existence. The Covid tyranny was not a one-off, either. For example, after the Port Arthur Massacre the police with very little resistance sometimes kicked down doors to seize firearms. That was ‚Äô96. Like Texas, Australia still has a few based areas but they are and have been for more than a century in the minority.

        Nibbling around the edges isn‚Äôt going to fix anything.  The American economy is rotten to the core.  As a result of the rot, it is simply too expensive to manufacture or mine in the US if foreign competition is a viable alternative.  It‚Äôs why we import steel rather than making it ourselves despite the massive iron ore deposits we are blessed with.It is impossible to compete with foreign companies which operate in places without all the regulations the US has.  Even if workers in the US were literal slaves, we could not compete with workers in places like China where all the laws are simply not enforced.  This only worked in the past because of the high productivity of American workers at the time. We had the best production machinery in the world.  Now they have the same high productivity machinery and are not burdened by endless regulations.

            This is the lesson that too few take from Mustache Man‚Äôs big mistake. He correctly realized that selling Germany‚Äôs vastly superior machine tools to untermenschen in exchange for cheap, low tech goods like food and fuel would eventually let them build their own factories. German autarky might have worked, but he quit trading tools for food way too early. German ag wasn‚Äôt close to sufficient, and it‚Äôs coal reserves weren‚Äôt suitable for autos. So he took on massive spending to get coal gasification going, and to jump-start ag.He would eventually come to realize that his autarky would only work if he played to German strengths, and annexed untermenschen in Grozny and Ukraine to do the grunt work.

        Go deeper. We have been too affluent for too long and most Americans are now fat and only suited for busy work in the service or parasite industries. The value of the dollar is essentially tied to the productivity of its people, and we‚Äôve just imported tens of millions of illegals to mow lawns and pick strawberries. Trump cannot wave a magic wand and turn this deadweight into rocket scientists. Each of us has a duty to remake ourselves as solid, strong, wise, and valuable contributors to real productive accomplishment. Anything else is failure.

I‚Äôd go further than that ‚Äî no way, no how.
There are all kinds of qualified people holding lesser positions. Without the H1bs, you would just hire them out of the low- and entry-level positions, freeing up space for younger programmers to get experience.
Rip the damn bandaid off. The wound is going septic.

        Since the plandemic, I‚Äôve kind of given up making economic predictions, because who could have predicted that, which was primarily an economic event, first and foremost. Being so informed, that they are willing and able to do things beyond imagination to save/protect their system, introduces a little humility in forecasting. I note that they did that with Trump in office, which he is about to be again.

            ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kind of given up making economic predictions, because who could have predicted that, which was primarily an economic event, first and foremost.‚ÄùIf you had heard about the repo problems at the banks late summer 2019, you knew something was coming.  I just didn‚Äôt expect the fraud of covid.  Though when you consider how much of the economy is fraud, well you need an even bigger fraud to cover it up and give you excuses to print money and bailout your cronies.  The covid numbers were fraud, so what do you think about economic numbers?  And i‚Äôd argue they‚Äôve been fraud since the late 90‚Äôs.

                The numbers have been fraud far longer than that.  It was JFK who didn‚Äôt like unemployment. So he changed the way it gets recorded and magically we have lower unemployment.  It was under Nixon that they first started really mucking around with inflation numbers, so magically, we‚Äôre whipping inflation now (WIN!).

                When you consider September 2019 was when the left, out of the blue, began an impeachment against trump, it really makes you wonder what the hell was going on. Like someone should foia all communications during that time.
Then, when the impeachment was over, COVID happened almost like clockwork. Was the impeachment a time buying exercise?

        The problem with Abenomics is it didn‚Äôt have any effect on Japan‚Äôs low birthrate, currently 1.2 per woman and dropping. Not enough babies were born 25 years ago to provide the workers in 2025 to design and run an industrial economy, or any economy. Our birthrate is better, 1.7 and declining. It‚Äôs 1.6 for blacks, whites and Asians; 1.9 for Hispanics. No recent data for immigrant women, but it‚Äôs been 0.4-point higher than native women. No one has a solution to this. But birth rates did tick up with the Reagan prosperity, as more families could afford to keep Mom home with the kids, cooking.

            I am very skeptical about any link between economics and fertility. Programs to increase TFR with tax breaks and cash prizes have all failed. Even cultural pressure seems to be failing in Asia.  Now, any cultural pressure that does not address the defect of sexual equality is doomed to fail.

                ‚ÄúI am very skeptical about any link between economics and fertility.‚ÄùI‚Äôm not, its called a depression for a reason.  Japan is essentially in the same boat as we are.  They ran up a huge debt bubble, and then decided to put all the debts on the public ledger because letting capitalism do its thing would mean the people running the show wouldn‚Äôt be running the show anymore.  That is all QE and 0% rates are about, making sure the people in charge stay in charge.  Shoulda let it happen peacefully, we all know where this goes next.  How you gonna have a family when a base house costs 400k and the media brain washes your wife to hate your sex?

                    Birth rates have collapsed everywhere. Sure, the economy has some impact but not much. Urbanization hurts for sure.
But the big reason is equality. As soon as women are allowed to get an education and allowed (either legally or culturally) into the workforce, birth rates plummet.

                    Dude, I‚Äôve lived in Japan for 30 years, nobody talks about the national debt. Its not a topic most normal Japanese  people talk about and never will be brought up. Nobody gives a shit about it. The economic hardship factor coming from that somehow suppressing birthrate doesn‚Äôt compute with observable reality.
What does, however, seems constant is low birth rates in countries with a presence of a high standard of living, living a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù life where no discernible physical danger is present, and abundance material wealth.
Economics is just an excuse not to have kids, not a valid reason.

                        Huzzah to Templar for the contrarian view. Something doesn‚Äôt wash with the ‚Äòeducated women‚Äô schtick; I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more a conformity with school year scheduling.
In other words, we outlawed puberty so we could match Rockefeller school schedules. Marriage after all is license to procreate. Let‚Äôs bring the young ones back into the system at an earlier age: work, marry, trade skills (remember Home Economics?). And adjust society to young people having kids, instead of scheduling kids to ‚Äúsociety‚Äù.
Earlier participation is what we need.An ‚Äúold maid‚Äù was 18 in Mom‚Äôs day.

                    TFR doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. There is also the phenomenon of women waiting into their thirties to have kids. This, I would argue, is a consequence of economics.Let‚Äôs say women had their 2.1 kids at or by 21. If this pattern holds then women would be grandmothers at 42, great grandmothers at 63, and great-great grandmothers at 84. However, if women hold off on their 2.1 kids until 35, then they are grandmothers at 70, and unlikely to ever be great grandparents, let alone great-great ones.See the problem? The TFR is still 2.1, but a whole generation is missing‚Ä¶

                Yep. I see all kinds of analysis for why birth rates have collapsed and many of the reasons (urbanization, high costs, etc.) mentioned, I‚Äôm sure, have some merit but, ultimately, are minor.
The big issue is equality. No matter the country or economy, as soon as women are allowed to be educated and are allowed (either legally or culturally) to enter the workforce, birth rates plummet. But no one ‚Äì and I mean no one ‚Äì wants to admit that this is ‚Äì by far ‚Äì the biggest contributor to falling birth rates.

Who, exactly, does that leave to oppose it?  Not enough is who, and these are carefully kept voiceless.

                    The unnoticed part of the Information Revolution was that women went from factory assembly lines (‚ÄúLiberation‚Äù) to fill the burgeoning need for data entry. The system needed sterile drones, and got them: the Hive.

                            I think the same is true for men. The jocks arrange for the company softball team, the student government types way too often end up schmoozing themselves into leadership, the nerds didn‚Äôt fit in, and still don‚Äôt. Everyone just keeps living the life he knows.
But IME, most men don‚Äôt form the more vile of the high-school-esque cliques in theworkplacethat women do.

                    CitizenOASC is correct on this.  The Pill made demographic collapse inevitable for developed economies.  Modern feelings of ennui accelerate it.  Unrestricted female hypergamy turbocharges it.  There‚Äôs credible data from multiple sources out there showing the bulk of young women are all chasing the same 15-20% of men ‚Äì and they‚Äôd rather become cat enjoyers than settle for ‚Äònormal‚Äô.  And of course most people are fat and gross now, so not much natural attraction is even possible.I can‚Äôt recall the source, but it was pointed out that we have instincts for sex and for nurturing, but perhaps not for reproduction per se.  Technology enables the comfort, convenience, freedom,and economic advantages ofchild-free life ‚Äì naturally folks will take advantage.Our society is evil, so not feeding it more people seems pretty defensible to me.  Let it die out.  Perhaps white people will re-evolve 10k years after collapse‚Ä¶

                        The hypergamy thing is definitely real, as is the fat slob epidemic. Data on female mate choice shows a very skewed bell curve, especially on the dating apps, which are how maybe more than half of young people meet these days. Pareto principle definitely applies.For some young men dating is almost as easy as ordering a pizza, for others‚Ä¶ a seemingly Sisyphean task. That said, I strongly believe that 20% could be expanded quite a bit if more young men would get off their butts and exercise just a bit. Really doesn‚Äôt take that much, 2-3 hours a week in the gym is definitely not an impossible task and it‚Äôs basically all you need if your diet is decent and you are consistent.The other problem is females are often really bad at making choices and their sexual drives are commonly self destructive (at least in our current small hat led cultural milieu). Go check out the romance novels they are reading, 95% of the titles are some variation of 50 shades of Grey. Bad boy who is mostly a POS but they can save him sort of thing. Very stupid, very self destructive. Might just be nature, idk, but I don‚Äôt think it was as bad as this before the 60s cultural dissolution of most traditional norms.Works out for me‚Ä¶ I have a sort of resting murder face and was gifted with moderate attractiveness, but I really don‚Äôt have much to offer besides sex. It should not be this easy for me. I don‚Äôt even have to fill out my profile, we just match and I charm and tease them a bit and‚Ä¶ fish in a barrel. Great for me personally but very bad for society. I am definitely not husband material at this time.Anyway, American culture is a small hat sewer and it‚Äôs been collectively poisoning us spiritually and psychologically for much longer than I have been alive. Very bad situation. As is the multicult. People need structure, traditions and stability. Probably impossible in a society as racially and culturally fractured as ours.Babylon was warned against for a reason.Reform.. I hope it‚Äôs possible. But it would take a long time and you would have to remove nearly all the bad actors from power and replace them with very wise and incorruptible paragons‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt see it happening‚Ä¶ maybe it might.If Trump were to release the Epstein/Diddy files and clean house of the worst of the corrupt power base we might have a shot.Hope so. Won‚Äôt hold my breath, but hope so.Bit larpy of a thing to say, but honestly, often feel like Bernhard/Helmholtz in ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù. Worth a read if you haven‚Äôt read it. Our contemporary social environment is way too similar to what was predicted in a book written almost a century ago.Freaks me out sometimes. That someone was very close to accurate in predicting a sociological experience very similar to our modern situation so long ago.. 1931, when all there was, was radio. I wish I had that level of prescience.Huxley is a mixed bag though, tbh. A lot of his writings are terrible. Was definitely touched by the muses when he wrote BNW however. Lightning in a bottle. Classic work of speculative fiction. At least half of his predictions have since become manifest. We even have the mostly ignored war between the west and east conglomerated power blocs.Fahrenheit 451 too. Many parallels.

                ‚ÄúEconomics‚Äù in the sense of monetary incentives is probably irrelevant. Theidea that children are unaffordablematters. Itworks. It‚Äôs not an economic idea. It‚Äôs a curse, a hypnotic spell that sways intelligent women and low-T men.Low birth rate is a sign of obedience. The spurious causes‚Äîeducated women, true wagie buying power, etc.‚Äîare other signs of it. To restrain the birth rate in Africa, Bill Gates needs an army of needles. To make Swedes and Koreans extinct, it takes only a word.But also, not breeding may be a correct reaction to the world being made uninhabitable. It‚Äôs being made uninhabitable for Swedes and Koreans, not for Indians and Nigerians.

                Good data here:https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rateThe crashing TFR is probably nature correcting for overpopulation.Example:https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/11/001128070536.htmHumans aren‚Äôt the only creatures on the planet that adapt their child bearing to the environment around them. Humans just add a layer of complexity but it‚Äôs a fairly normal biological process of adjusting the birth rate to suit the availability of resources.Thats why policy changes don‚Äôt work short of straight up paying women to stay home and have kids while simultaneously eliminating most of the rearing costs. Everybody‚Äôs got a price.A lot of women work because they can. But many more work because they must. It is almost impossible these days to support a family on one income because we‚Äôve monetized every aspect of existence.Pay a woman $100K salary to have a minimum of 4 kids, raise them to adulthood, stay married, and never pay taxes again.And if we‚Äôre not willing to pay for it, how big of a problem is it, really?

Then the wives can stay home and raise their own children as they ought to.  Out of all the people my husband and I knew socially and economically, I was the only stay-at-home mom.  It cost us big economically, but we don‚Äôt regret it.

        ‚ÄúWhether it can work in America is unknown, but we will know soon enough.‚Äù
It most probably can‚Äôt, and for reasons you carefully and patiently explain earlier in your essay. Trump will be trying to bail out a sinking imperial ship that has gaping holes in a dozen places with nothing save a cup in his hand. All empires are by definition extortion rackets and these rackets have lifespans that eventually expire. The same is now happening to the US empire, on which the sun is now setting.

            The smart industrialists are not going to invest in America anymore IMHO.    They have gamed out all of the scenarios and come to the conclusion that it just won‚Äôt pay off.   For example billions of government supplied dollars spent to place a semi conductor factory in Arizona and the DIE policies are making it impossible to ever be competitive.   The majority of the perspective companies bailed out.You do have some like Elon Musk but he is just a scammer.   None of his Teslas would sell, save for massive government subsidies for EVs and tax breaks for owning one.   Even then people are coming to understand just how impractical they are for most people.

You can buy a BYD (Chinese electric car) for between $21,000 and $23,000. This is probably why Musk needs US government protection (Trump is threatening a 100% tariff on imports from Mexico). Crony capitalism at its finest.

                    BYD is‚Äîif I have read and viewed tests correctly‚Äîan example of a quality EV in every sense.  Musk would do well to be afraid.  Again, China can build crap and rob you blind if you are unwary, but that aspect of their competition will never hurt us.  Higher quality will, and China does produce some good stuff.

                        That‚Äôs not what I heard. I‚Äôm pretty sure it was BYD which just had a recall in Australia for electrocution hazard if you go to unplug it while still charging. There are a lot of reports out of China of BYDs crashing(on their own), airbags not going off, people trapped and unable to get out of burning BYD cars. People jokingly call them Burn Your Driveway.This may be just exaggeration for effect, but we‚Äôve all been dealing with chineseum for over 2 decades and should have learned our lessons by now. Good luck trying to service anything out of China.

                    These Chinese cars should never be approved for our highways.  Take everything you know about pure Chinese (as in Chinese branded, not American branded made in China) consumer goods and now apply it to cars.  I recommend you check out the Big Clive youtube channel.  My favorite example is USB charge block that put 240v (UK spec) across the USB ground, the only part easy to touch.
They just had a recall on BYD cars in Australia for electrocution risk.  Not to mention the potential for spying.

        The generally-accepted figure for those living paycheck to paycheck is 78% of wage earners. When inflation outpaces wage increases, these people feel it intensely and cannot be BSed out of that feeling.  They have little in the way of savings so any monetary setback (e.g., a major car repair) goes on the credit card to be repaid at arm-and-leg interest rates.

        They‚Äôre just going to start telling the truth of the economy once Trump gets into office, or something close it. Expect further massive downgrades to the 2024 job numbers, and start reporting GDP contraction to get a ‚ÄúTrump recession‚Äù declared in 2025, even though the media spent most of 2021 claiming that two quarters of GDP contraction isn‚Äôt AKSHULLY a recession.Trump is going to be fighting these dynamics and the City of London while trying to nudge the economy is a structural direction that is healthier for America. That takes time. Unfortunately his moves are long-term, while the City of London has the media, the Washington bureaucracy, many large banks, and the cosmopolitan elite on its side. It‚Äôs the same dynamic with immigration really.

        Trump wants to use the threat of tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the US. That‚Äôs fine, but if he manages that, he‚Äôll create problems for the dollar and inflation.Bringing manufacturing back will help blue collar workers but will also increase inflation. There‚Äôs a reason firm like to manufacture overseas. I‚Äôm fine with this, but will Americans be happy about higher prices? Probably not.Also, by reducing the trade deficit, you reduce the number of dollars leaving the US and thus floating around the global financial system. Given the relatively fixed need for dollars in the global financial system, you‚Äôll increase the value of the dollar, which causes a host of problems.First, you cause inflation around the world. If businesses in Vietnam buy and sell goods in dollars, a rise in the dollar makes everything more expensive. Second, you increase the debt repayment costs of dollar-denominated debt (and there‚Äôs a lot of it) around the world. Both of these will hurt economic growth.Also, if the trade deficit shrinks, you could have lower demand for US treasury debt, which would push up interest rates. That‚Äôs not good.All roads lead to inflation. Trump will cut taxes and, despite what Bessent says, keep the deficit high, which means dollars getting pumped into the system which is inflationary. Bringing manufacturing home means inflation.The dollar needs to fall for a variety of reasons and that means inflation.

            Yep, all negative consequences in the immediate future.  That‚Äôs the pain talked about here and everywhere there are knowledgeable people in the conversation.  The real discussion should be to the effect of what brings the greatest good in the long run.  For me, it‚Äôs that my neighbor has a job and a hope for a better future for his children.  That his/our/my standard of living declines, so be it.Our standard of living is built on debt.  It was phony to begin with.  It can never be made real. When I was a young boy, we had everything we needed.  I desired nothing material, yet we possessed nothing in excess.   Now I have such abundance that more causes problems in simply possessing such, and yet a growing proportion of my community cannot meet the simple costs of food, clothing, shelter.Such is the disparity of wealth in this country.  Enough already. We as a species were not designed to live in such abundance, it makes us weak and crazy.

                        The population now is around half again what it was when your parents bought.  People moved further away to get lower prices. You can still do that. Just that your old neighborhood is no longer the place with the lower prices. You have to travel further, because of the more than 100 million more people in the States.
It doesn‚Äôt help that policy choices and personal preferences have driven those prices through the roof.

            Yes. The incoming Trump Administration seemingly has baked into the cake continued inflation and increased interest rates. It will engage in deficit reduction kabuki and blame the cost cutting‚Äôs inevitable failure for the higher prices and the higher cost of borrowing. Will that work politically? Don‚Äôt discount it in a country with a high rate of innumeracy and economic illiteracy. If the rubes can be fooled into transferring the blame and the nation can reindustrialize, the country theoretically could thrive a long time. Also helpful is a media, including the financial press, that has discredited itself and will be ignored even if it reports accurately. The other problems, which are more severe in every imaginable way (think demographics, feminism and the resultant atomization, among other factors), makes a sustained renaissance a very unlikely result in the long term.

                Agree, except the govt can‚Äôt afford positive real (above inflation) interest rates. They will deficit spend and one way or the other, keep treasury interest rates below the true inflation rate.If GDP is real growth + inflation, positive real interest rates are a budget killer. Assume 3% inflation and 2% real GDP growth, so 5% nominal. If you have the real interest rate on govt debt at just 1%, you‚Äôd have a 4% rate. With debt to GDP at 125%, that‚Äôs 5% of GDP going to interest on the debt.The govt only takes in ~17% of GDP, so nearly a third.Entitlements = ~14.5% of GDPDefense = ~3.5%Total = 18% of GDPYou already have a deficit of 1% of GDP from just those two. Discretionary spending is ~3.5%, so now, the deficit is up to 4.5% ‚Äì which is very close to nominal GDP. And that‚Äôs structural.So, here‚Äôs the equation:Nominal GDP growth = (Entitlements + Defense + Discretionary) ‚Äì Govt Tax ReceiptsWhat did we leave out of the equation? That‚Äôs right, interest on the debt expense. Therefore, we have a new equation:Annual Growth in Debt to GDP = Interest CostsAgain, if you have 4% interest rates on 125% of Debt to GDP, you get 5% of GDP for interest costs, which means that debt to GDP grows by five percentage points a year. Thus, in four years of Trump, debt to GDP would increase from 125% to 145% (a tad more really). And that‚Äôs assuming no recession.That won‚Äôt work. Govt borrowing would crowd out too much other borrowing. The bond market can‚Äôt handle that amount of new debt without being forced to buy it. The whole global financial system would come unhinged.Nope, we have to have negative real interest rates. That means either Fed buys some of the debt or it forces banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and others to buy it. Regardless, that means dollars flowing into the system via deficit spending and that means inflation.

                    I didn‚Äôt know there would be math!
I actually follow you but don‚Äôt see how negative interest rates could be imposed long term unless there were more political control of the Fed than there currently is. From memory, Europe‚Äôs experiment with negative interest rates ended after quite a bit of central bank grumbling. Also, hasn‚Äôt there already been some movement toward requiring financial institutions buying Federal debt? I know that‚Äôs at least been put on the table. If interest rates reflected reality even now, what would they be? It certainly would exceed those of the Seventies.

                        The Fed doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to buy the debt. They or Treasury Debt could just change the rules on banks, hedge funds and the mutual fund industry to require holding more treasury bonds.The Fed could also open a lending window to bank where the bank could borrow at a rate slightly below the interest on treasuries if they use the money to buy treasuries. Or the Fed could just guarantee treasuries so the banks could buy without fear.It‚Äôs not my world but even I know of five or ten things the govt could do outside of directly buying the debt. But you still end up with inflation.As to what real rates would be without interference, hard to say, but probably ~1% on T-bills and ~2% on 5-10 year bonds. Historically, the 10-yr earned nominally about the nominal GDP growth.

                            Btw, they could also just lie about the rate of inflation. If the govt says inflation is 3% but it‚Äôs really 6%, then nominal GDP growth will be ~8%.
If treasuries are earning 1% above the govt-stated inflation rate of 3%, the rate would be 4%, well below actual inflation.

                    Agreed.  More simply stated, the only way to keep from bankruptcy is to reduce real debt with inflation.  The only other option is spending cuts to everything, including the military and entitlements, but those are impossible politically until you are already in bankruptcy.

                        Correct. It sounds crazy, but the best option is to inflate away the debt. The alternative is a depression where the debt is wiped away via bankruptcy.
People hear this and think Weimar Germany, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be so drastic. However, the problem with this plan is that voters hate inflation.

        ‚ÄúThe Trump plan is to restructure the economy, which will require massive spending and a considerable amount of pain.‚Äù This hits the spot!A fair measure of system resilience is its ability to withstand pain in order to improve efficiency. Few countries have such systems. Even China is struggling with this. Ironically, Russia stands out here because they are willing to accept a lot of pain to avoid Western domination. Argentina is taking some pain but perhaps they had run out of choices. I‚Äôm skeptical the US oligarchy will be able to endure pain. Beating up on the working class was one thing, but firing bureaucrats and cutting the MIC is another.

            I just watched a video about Argentina by some economist on youtube.  He says there are a bunch of payments due in 2025 that they don‚Äôt have the foreign reserves to make.  IIRC, he said the central bank had a huge net negative of foreign reserves, albeit slightly less negative than the day Milei took office.  According to him, they have a ton of Dollar or other foreign currency denominated debt.  There had been a 5 year grace period on that debt that ends this year.

        I remember reading somewhere ‚Äì I think it might have been in Caldwell‚Äôs book ‚Äì that the unspoken rule used to be that democrats were able to have control over the culture while republicans were able to make money. At what point did that agreement get broken ‚Äì maybe Obama?

            Those dynamics started to change under Clinton. Obama probably cemented it though, especially as he sat back while big tech took over our society.

                As somebody here (Alzaebo?) pointed out the other day, it happened because the corporations were taken over by the indoctrinated products of the pozzed academy, which just happened to coincide with Clinton being in office. The revolution began in the academy.

                    My mom made me see that movie where Dennis Quaid played Reagan and it was irritating. While it is true that the Berlin Wall fell not long after he left office, I feel that people like him misdiagnosed communism. It‚Äôs like  when someone is cured of cancer and it comes back a few years later and kills them. Whatever system we have in america now is basically a more implicit form of communism.I also think Reagan may have had an outdated view of the soviet union. It obviously wasn‚Äôt heaven on earth in 1981 but all the things Reagan thought about the USSR was really from the 20s and 30s. When people think about the Soviet Union, that‚Äôs what they are really thinking of.

        150 years ago, you eeeeeeevil capitalist American pig dogs sailed your fiendish gun boats across the Sea of Japan, parked them in Tokyo Bay‚Ä¶ and then went ashore and declared that Japan was now open for business. Samurai warriors armed with swords looked down their noses at you and wondered what in hell was wrong with you people. Horses crapped in the street, and shrines to exotic gods were everywhere.80 years later‚Ä¶ The Japs sailed their aircraft carriers across the Pacific, and Japanese planes bombed the shit out of Pearl Harbour. The Americans coughed in the fire and smoke and wondered what in hell was wrong with those people.40 years after you defeated them in the Pacific‚Ä¶ they beat you up and ate your lunch! The best optics are made in Japan. The best cars and motorcycles and steel and glass are made in Japan. Time flies.Over In the sandbox: in the 1990s the ragheads were mostly backward foreign weirdos that annoyed (((our greatest allies))) and occasionally us ourselves. 30 years have passed. A couple months back, some muds calling themselves ‚ÄúHooties‚Äù ‚Äì put the run on a US Naval aircraft carrier group and ran them out of the Red Sea. Iran struck at heavily defended Israeli targets with hypersonic missiles‚Ä¶ and destroyed them. It‚Äôs debatable whether or not they‚Äôre refining weapons grade plutonium at the moment.30 years ago Reagan would get those monkeys to the negotiating table with a dirty look. Today Biden tries to beg Arabia for any spare gasoline because he kneecapped his domestic suppliers. The Saudis told him to FOAD. Biden shat his pants and demanded ice cream.The world has changed, Dissidents! Again! You‚Äôve talked a great talk ever since I found you all 5 years ago or so. I hope I live long enough to see what you actually do‚Ä¶üòÇüëç

As necessary as a restructuring is, the considerable amount of pain is precisely why I believe this won‚Äôt happen.  I don‚Äôt think Trump‚Äôs ego would be unable to accept this.
