        The Left will never accept regionalism.  They are convinced that they are correct about everything, and everyone else is wrong, even though many of their stated positions fundamentally contradict each other.  To accept regionalism is to accept that they are not right about all things, at all times, in all places.  Liberalism is a religion, and blasphemers must always pay the price!

            I like to refer to this as rabid self-righteousness so, yes, it is a religion.

                Of course liberal globalism a religion; DisruptJ20 was coordinated from St. Stephen‚Äôs Episcopal Church, where they follow the teachings and example of the rabidly globalist Jewish activists Jesus (Matthew 28:19) and St. Paul. (Galatians 3:28.)

                        I don‚Äôt have STDs; are you projecting your own skankiness? And, being a straight heterosexual male, I neither chop off my balls like Jesus implored his followers,(Matthew 19.11-12) nor do I want to live in an androgynous utopia where normative male-female relationships are prohibited.(Matt. 22.30)
But I bet you‚Äôre just the type to appreciate a feminist Rabbi who comes White-knighting for skanky whores. (John 8:4-11)

                            Your obnoxious sneering is unwelcome.I‚Äôm angered by your attacks on such commentors as Let‚Äôs Play, a good and gracious man- and on Joy, just now.You waste your fine talents on vitriol.I appreciate the unconventional detail, very much, but your bile is making we non-religious look bad.I realize you‚Äôre angry because the coded dialect of monotheism doesn‚Äôt answer your questions.   That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt know either- we use a wrench to try to turn a screw.Please use that mind to examine the deeper social functions of religion.Start here:  ‚ÄúReligion began as politics‚Ä¶‚ÄùAnd do try to notch down the outright prickitude.  Help us.

                                    Learn to translate? I did! Jesus worships Uranus. And hears Uranus talk. Have you ever heard Uranus saying anything?

You‚Äôd do well to realize that some Jews took a big punch bowl of old Greek paganism and shat a Jew-worship turd in it.

                                Alzaebo, I like your sprit ‚Äî it‚Äôs the spirit of an anti-Christ.‚Ä¢ Christ taught to be meek. You‚Äôre not being meek.‚Ä¢ Christ taught to be angry. You‚Äôre angered.‚Ä¢ Christ taught resist not. You‚Äôre resisting.‚Ä¢ etc. etc. (I could make a huge list.)Like most Europeans, you don‚Äôt actually follow the teachings of Christ; you effectively piss on them just as I do. So what do you think worshiping a Jew helps a White man? Do tell me.And I‚Äôm NOT against religion or monotheism, I‚Äôm all for it ‚Äî what‚Äôs written into our Declaration of Independence. Why cannot you just worship GNON (the Laws of Nature and/Or Nature‚Äôs God, Deus, sive Natura) like a good ol‚Äô red blooded American boy?Bile is bad? Try out this patriotic bile, snowflake:‚ÄúI almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved‚Äîthe Cross. Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!‚Äù -John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, September 3, 1816Triggered, boy? Maybe this sort of free nation where we can speak our minds just isn‚Äôt quite right for you.

                                    Try to keep the comments at least somewhat relevant to the topic. You keep demanding everyone debate your views on religion. This is not the place for that debate.

                                        Z man, I was on topic. Jews promote globalism, from Jesus and St. Paul to George Soros and Barbara Spectre. That Jewish poison keep bubbling up from Christianity in places like St. Stephen‚Äôs Episcopal Church, the coordination center for the D.C. protests. Christianity is a globalist poison to our society.

Agreed.  The current Left cannot actually accept anything reasonable from a practical socio-political point of view because, for them; Their Indignanty is Their Identity (TM).  That is, because of their indoctrination into the ‚ÄòUS sucks more than anything anywhere else‚Äô dogma, they are forced to define themselves by what they are indignant about in normal US life.
Exhibit A is this last weekend‚Äôs well organized but incoherent  ‚Äòwomen Indignant about whatever‚Äô gathering.

                They can not accept anything outside their ideology, it is existential to do so, acceptance is admission of guilt. Dutch said it perfectly, they can never be wrong, the whole edifice of cultural marxism would collapse.It‚Äôs one reason why they hate Trump and The Great Fuck You of us dirt people. To acknowledge any aspect of the revolution, the counter cold civil war against them is literally admitting defeat. Sure there‚Äôs members of the hive who write pieces where they skulk around the edges of admitting they may have done wrong, but it is rationalizations, to create modified memes and narratives, they are plugging up holes and weak spots in their armor of lies.

            10-4 Dutch. Excellent comment. The left is kind of like the ultimate opinionated horde. Their opinions mean more to them than the people around them.You and Z are dead nuts right. They never accepted regionalism, in it‚Äôs purest form, with the Compact of Confederation of the States, a loose confederacy of state governments where states rights were to be the rule could not be tolerated, and ever since the Compact Theory has been accorded fascist status by Yankeedom. In his speeches against ratification Patrick Henry noted that the delegates in Philadelphia had overstepped their bounds in that they had not been sent there with power to create a central government, but only to amend the Articles of Confederation. But certain delegates had to have the specific intent, because in the face of gathering in Philadelphia with the mandate from the various States to address specific shortcomings, and strengthen the bonds of that Compact, instead went far beyond any of the States wildest suspicions, and created the instrument of administrative tyranny aka The US Constitution. And the only way the Fabian‚Äôs could get the States to ratify it was with the addition of the Bill of Rights, which if you see the contrasts, the States themselves, and by Compact, had no need for a BoR, because of the nature of their sovereignty and closeness of association of the people who resided within them.And they have never stopped in acting out in their dread and fear of Regionalism, to this day. They have created a steady stream of perjoratives relating regionalism, which is really at the heart of it, sovereignty on the individual, tribe, local, and state level. Take popularism right now. The legacy media, the echo chamber of Yankeedom, has at every opportunity painted with the press‚Äôs brush of negativity and fascism, racism, what have you.

        Just as President Trump will focus resources on rejuvenating our failing national infrastructure, so to should the educational structure be torn down to the studs for a major renovation.  We have spent so much time and been bombarded over the past eight years by programming of how wonderful the world‚Äôs countries are compared to the US.  Oh, the Middle East!  Oh, China!  (Don‚Äôt get me started on Global warming!)Well, it is also time to renew, re-introduce people to the various regions of the US so that perceptions (many that are now out dated) can be updated and fellow Americans can be appreciated.  Shows like Mike Rowe‚Äôs ‚ÄúDirty Jobs‚Äù or Larry ‚ÄúThe Cableguy‚Äù are hardly a pint of water against an ocean of progressive brainwashing about many countries that have nothing on the US.  But they are quick and ready to highlight the weaknesses of America while others are shown in better light.  President Obama was quick to praise China for it‚Äôs new and gleaming roads and airports without mentioning that they are all new, or without saying he would do anything to fix America‚Äôs decaying infrastructure.  Well, he did talk about ‚Äúshovel ready jobs‚Äù but that‚Äôs all it was ‚Ä¶ talk.As with individuals, regions need to be appreciated.  I still marvel at the simple ‚Äúaccent‚Äù differences between regions even though we speak the same language.  Everyone has history.  And these histories need to be learned and appreciated.  Things that happened over the last eight years were so divisive as to set our nation back decades.  For example, the whole debate about things like the Confederate Flag.  Condemning a symbol of something that has many definition and trampling the First Amendment Rights of others is not something to be tolerated in this country.So this brings me to the foundation of the problem ‚Ä¶ lack of understanding a appreciate of our way of life and what this country is founded on.  American History and Civil Government needs to be required and integral to any matriculation through our education system.  Let‚Äôs face it.  Ignorance is the main problem and today ignorance reigns.  We have to fix the education system.

                    I mostly agree with the saying ‚ÄúIf it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it.‚Äù  But education is broken and needs to be fixed.  The Trump Train has the momentum to make the changes and fight the unions, primarily through direct competition, to force change.

                        @ LetsPlay ‚Äì I just finished reading a very interesting book ‚ÄúThe Shame of the Cities‚Äù written by American author Lincoln Steffens and published in 1904. It‚Äôs also available as a download PDF and well worth a read. It could have been written today. No that shame is not unique to America, we Europeans share a similar shame in the way we have allowed these things to happen. In many ways, we have only ourselves to blame since we, the voting public, put our respective politicians into office.

                            Karl, thank you the reference.  I will be sure to look it up.  As you can hear with current protests, the Left seems to think the problem is always ‚Äúnot enough money,‚Äù however, America spends more money per student but has no way of correcting the performance deficit.  It is voters at the local level but it reaches all the way to the Federal level with socialist programs like Common Core that seek to make all students ‚Äúequal.‚Äù  Just as teachers do not want to be bothered with ‚Äúboys‚Äù, they want them to act like ‚Äúgirls‚Äù who are less rambunctious and energetic as boys typically are.  Everything is for the benefit of the State but postured as benefiting the children.

                    Can‚Äôt begin justify your traitorous longing for a foreign King to dominate you in a middle-eastern capital?

                        Great gods, you puke.Why do you not revel in the fact that Whites took a Semitic strategy book for slave raiders (the OT), and a propaganda campaign created by a spy for the secret police (Paul, whose mission was find the Apostles for execution- he was purged in turn by the next administration: the NT)-And turned these things into something great and glorious, a deep well of memory and self-programming that brought us this world of miracles?The historical person of the Christ- a legitimate heir to the throne, a reformist representative of the people, rejected as a royal bastard by the ruling class- is not what is important.What is important is his archetype.He is the embodiment of goodwill in any population.You err, because you can‚Äôt separate the functions of several components.Time crushes things together.Right brain information processing is holistic and aphasic- trying to put it into words gives us oracles, prophets and madmen because that processing is for a different function than speech.  (Speech itself is misunderstood- it has two deep functions, not one; communicating information and emotive organizing of our groups.)Let‚Äôs start again:The Bible, ‚ÄúGod‚Äù, and heaven (the nonmaterial world, the afterlife) are separate things.  They‚Äôre not really related.Ideas come in camps, and are melded by the crush of time.Now- proceed.  And stop being a toad.

Fair warning‚Ä¶.
‚ÄúIt is beyond reasonable dispute that Luke dates the birth of Jesus to 6 A.D. It is equally indisputable that Matthew dates the birth of Jesus to 6 B.C. (or some year before 4 B.C.). This becomes an irreconcilable contradiction after an examination of all the relevant facts‚Ä¶.‚Äù

                        Troll. I hate Trolls. A Troll‚Äôs purpose is to disrupt the comment thread. They show up any place there is worthy and honorable discourse, in particular when the discussion involves peoples self determination and individualism, and a Republic that cherishes such freedoms.This is no joke. There are thousands of paid Trolls, agent provocateurs and self appointed cultural marxist thought police and SJW‚Äôs who lurk and slink around comments threads waiting to pounce.

                            I have noticed trolls are usually passive/aggressives. They stir up with contentiousness and wait, smacking their lips, fingers itching, for someone to take the bait. Then they rise up over the din they have created and plead innocence. After all it‚Äôs not their fault if others are so easily riled.
The best counter is to ignore the bait. They cannot reach their goal if they cannot get a response.

                                Most definitely.Like the ‚Äúprotesters‚Äù against Trump, it is the toxic element they represent, like the cold civil war, there is something disingenuous behind it all. What they are attempting is disruption of freedom of speech, peoples right of self determination, government as will of the governed, which they see as a problem to be solved by way of discrediting things that don‚Äôt fit their world view, when these are things representative of a failing system and of genuine concern. It is toxic behavior, a symptom of a discredited ideological system of totalitarianism. Trolls are totalitarians among us. They represent no kind of solution and are a danger because they are part of that system.

        I don‚Äôt like to comment on blogs with admiration usually, but in this case I believe I am entirely justified. I think this is a post displaying rare insight into what could be seen as a complex dilemma. America is clearly still affected by the civil war. Gun psyche for example. And like a ship chasing the lubber line, Trump is a product of an America that has gone too far left, and needed to come back to 0 degrees badly. If that means going 10 STBD, so be it I say.America aside, the west in general are battling the leftist cultural disease. It would be worth some thought into what distinguishes the rest of the west with the leftist damage on America due to the civil war to isolate exactly what has happened and where it diverges.Top article, cheers.

            For the anglo world it‚Äôs the sixties. That generation is in it‚Äôs prime now and until it‚Äôs gone very little real progress can be made . Believing that trumper can do attitude could change thing is an illusion like treating cancer with leukemia. The patient may not survive the procedure.From my outsider perspective the most important thing is can the trump movement produce the next generation of political leaders that can make a convincing anti progressive argument  If it‚Äôs just a one man show it will only serve as a rallying cry for the new progressive generation .As for the Europe, it‚Äôs a different story. We are stuck long term with the left of center politics . EU has become a global trade behemoth and it‚Äôs not worth it to dismantle just because our far left is flourishing in it. Sadly it will likely lead to a old world vs new world conflict .

        The Trump rebound will last as long as it takes for people to get a bounce back in their step and reacquire their worst political instincts, as it did with Reagan. Right now we hope to make it past the bodies of John, Lindsey, and Paul to the first turn on that track. The Trump era will be the last period of time that we shall see any successful resistance to the tyranny of universal suffrage. Burke‚Äì‚ÄúTell me what the prevailing sentiments that occupy the minds of your young peoples, and I will tell you what is to be the character of the next generation.‚Äù Those  sentiments lay between ignorant and misinformed.

            You forget that the Reagan administration was almost immediately hijacked by Bush. Reagan getting shot by a Bush family friend was the ‚Äúconvincer‚Äù, after that Reagan let Bush pretty much run the show. So no one should be surprised that the ‚ÄúReagan Revolution‚Äù went nowhere.

        I‚Äôm all for natural regionalism. It‚Äôs the first step toward semi-autonomous super-states governing themselves with an eye toward unity if there is an external threat. At that point the Northeast would be begging for help as it is filled for the most part with Ivy League sissies and would be quickly annihilated by an invading force. (Anyone who has a gun and would like to keep it will have moved south as soon as they feasibily could). Canada and Mexico would also come begging. The Reverand Dr. Smith and Vandeveer sound like they actually wish for civil war. They would be the first to grovel for help if it actually happened as they would have no idea of how to defend themselves. The natural order on the continent would be restored. I know this is pretty much a pipe dream but it‚Äôs fun to think about.

Haley sell out in SC) with a NYC Billionaire‚Äôs campaign sign also in his front yard.DemocRats and ChamberPots had abandoned him and it was a plain enough sign if anyone had been looking from the DC Elitist bubble, but of course they weren‚Äôt and still aren‚Äôt.Voting is a polite way of telling the Elites something, if these putzes sabotage Trump, then the ‚Äúpoliteness‚Äù is going to vanish. It should be noted the ‚ÄúSouthern Deplorables‚Äù are now nationwide, but these elitist Progs will never ‚Äúget it‚Äù ever.

            At this point I‚Äôd fly a Confederate flag if I had a house and I‚Äôm about as Yankee as they come. But it would enrage the right people, so it‚Äôs all good as far as I‚Äôm concerned.

        ‚ÄúThe Collapse of the Left‚Äôs Great Con‚Äù, Charles Hugh-Smith, linked at Zero Hedge, should be required reading.  Very relevant to the current conversation.  Hugh-Smith argues that capital has dominated labor in the Marx model, and the wealthy Left has sold out to the power of capital to personally enrich people, leaving labor in the dust.  Labor has figured out the con, and has turned to Trump for some sort of reversal of the process.  The wealthy Left (e.g. Soros) has encouraged the whole Social Justice Warrior thing to mask their abandonment of labor and perpetuate the con, under the cover of social conflict.  So we get a public, coordinated primal scream in pink hats, carefully scripted and choreographed to be ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù.

            But of course, they‚Äôre the useful idiots continuing to fan the flames of dissent, pure cannon fodder.  Unfortunately, the puppet masters are still behind the scenes biding their time.  It‚Äôs the same reason they embrace islam, co-conspirator for the same end state each thinking they will be driving the ship feeding off each other.  Frankly, we got lucky.  Luckier than even most will ever know or understand, but it‚Äôs over.  Not even close.  The left is now a cornered animal.  Possible to put it in the cage and take out a field somewhere?  Maybe.  Possible to let the regionalism approach control the outliers on the basis of universal values and minimize the left‚Äôs influence (aka the all red voter turn out map)? Maybe.  But both systems cannot coexist regionally if they both seek to control the political dialogue nationally.  Sure politics is all local, but the left does not have time to locally turn the tide based on the defectors that have embraced Trump for what he can do for their own personal situations.  In other words, a guy has got to eat.  He might identify with the right and forget about the left until a national tide comes along the can ride back to their side.  The leftist power players do not have that luxury.  It is tantamount to us nuking medina to prove mo is a fake.  Their struggle and potential victory is their way of showing our side has no power.  They are more dangerous than ever.   I want to be wrong. It is my greatest hope.  However, someone once said hope is not a sound operating methodology.  And because of that you prepare for war so when it finds you, you are not surprised.

        It‚Äôs really this simple: negotiate a CalExit and the remaining Republic survives another 50-100 years.Without California in the Union, demographic changes over the next 8-12 years will sweep the Democrats into power at the Federal level on a permanent basis. The Democrats will naturalize illegal immigrants and throw open the gates to new immigrants, ensuring their electoral dominance. Large swaths of American geography will remain red and Republicans could conceivably keep the House and periodically control the Senate, but the Executive Branch will be controlled by Democrats permanently. There will be gridlock in the legislative function and the Executive Branch will govern by Executive Order, rather like Obama did.Regionalism is possible in the former scenario. Democrats will have no incentive to permit any sort of regionalism in the latter scenario.

        ‚ÄúThe one thing all sides of the political class may accept in the end is a restoration of the natural regionalism that has always existed in America.‚Äù  I‚Äôd agree with this, IFF the inmates weren‚Äôt running the asylum (in both parties, but especially on the Left).  The one thing that reconciled me to the possibility of a Hillary presidency was her corruption ‚Äî she‚Äôd mandate school prayer, concealed carry, and NASCAR viewership if she could make a buck off it. But she‚Äôs also in her 70s, i.e. the last of the old school.  The younger generation **really believes this stuff.**  The Cult really is a cult; the thought that someone, somewhere is doing things wrong, and thus in need of a good reeducation, is what gets them up in the morning.  Short of actually herding them into camps ‚Äî and do we have an ETA on that, Herr Trump? ‚Äî they‚Äôll never stop.  It won‚Äôt end well.

        Much in this post confirms what I have myself learned in this last year.   One quibble.    The ‚Äúblue‚Äù state and ‚Äúred‚Äù  state thing began in 1992 with the Media propaganda effort to elect Bill Clinton.    I remember this vividly because I started screaming at the television when I first saw it.Stories were going around about Bill Clinton‚Äôs association with communists,  his travels to the Soviet Satellite states and his opposition to the Vietnam war through protesting in London.    I realized immediately that coloring Clinton ‚Äúblue‚Äù  was an effort to divert attention from his Red Communist activities during the 1960s.Coloring him ‚Äúred‚Äù  would make what he was all too obvious,  and it would cost him millions of votes on that basis alone.    They colored him ‚Äúblue‚Äù  because hiding information is one of the methods they use to manipulate the elections.

        The local Swiss paper just published two photos showing the crowds at the Obama inauguration and the Trump inauguration. While the sizes of the crowds is clearly different, I suspect those who were in attendance for Obama were unemployed and had nothing better to do that day. Of course that point was not mentioned.

        Z Man;I suppose we may be seeing a ‚Äòcleavage plain convergence‚Äô (to borrow a concept from mineralogy) forming in our politics now.  IOW, just as any mineral contains hidden systematic weaknesses at the molecular level which causes it to split apart into characteristic shapes under pressure or a blow, (and this property is so characteristic that it serves to identify unknown minerals) so does a political entity contain hidden (papered over_?) systematic weaknesses that may rupture under strain.It is a good insight that Regional Culture is a highly logical cleavage plane, and it is a potentially likely one, since it also looks to be coincident with other potential political cleavage planes such as class interest, economic interest, recent history, religion and social-cultural norms.  That said, regions are not universal or definitive.  For example, the regional schemes cited make it look like the entire upper midwest, where I live, is part of Yankee-land.  But outside of the few (but significant) Cloud-ruled enclaves like Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis SP, Madison WI, Ann Arbor MI, etc., the bulk of the land area feels much more like the South on most of the other non-historical variables listed above.  And this is bourn out by the county-by-county red/blue map.Indeed, whatever one thinks of Lincoln, one of his critical but often under appreciated political accomplishments was to paper over most of the very real potential cleavage planes in the North.  For a real but largely unexplored example, on the basis of language and religion, it might have been possible for a provence of Gross Deutschland to have emerged from the breakup of the 1860 US.  It galled the New England Yankees to have to appoint German generals for the blue armies but Lincoln wisely and rightly insisted upon it.  To begin with, many ion the troopers under their command (unlike the black regiments) spoke no English*So we can conclude the IF another real civil war were to break out, a great deal of multi-dimensional ethnic cleansing will be involved, both voluntary and involuntary.  And for that reason alone, no sane citizen should wish for one.  As you said in your previous post, those who talk glibly or, worse yet, join Soros et al in promoting enter and intra ethnic violence are playing with fire.**Yes, yes, I know, both groups were said comprise inferior troops at the time: A vexed subject.  But just as Stalin said, ‚Äòquantity has a quality all by itself. and so they contributed something just by showing up dressed to play.

Read the Z-Man again: This stuff takes 200 years +++ to resolve. The Germans are getting close to resolving their 2500 year old conflicts with the Gaels, Slavs and Romans. Of course, being Germans, they are already starting new conflicts, but that‚Äôs how we humans roll.
Any solution that does not consist of us grinding them down, and them grinding us down, is nonsense.

                I believe you are mostly right but you need to factor in the methodology of the participants.  The right thinks in large terms like the bricks in the wall.  The left thinks in terms of the mortar, cut it away and the bricks fall.  The left doesn‚Äôt really contribute anything they just destroy‚Ä¶.

            I think ‚Äúrapid change‚Äù is mostly the result of people not noticing the gradual change and then all of a sudden noticing it all at once. In this case, I suspect Trump will get a lot done in a short time, but it‚Äôs mostly due to the fact that so much of it should have been done decades ago.

                I have to agree with that.  In many things in life it can take a long time to build up to what looks like ‚Äúrapid change‚Äù.  I know this is what happens with me very often when I‚Äôm working on a project.  It can months or sometimes years ‚Äì to build up to the point where all the pieces are finally together enough to pull the trigger finally and pull something off.  To the outsider ‚Äì it looks like rapid progress , but the reality is there was a lot of groundwork that was laid before hand.One of the things that has caught me by surprise with the whole Trump thing ‚Äì is that there are so many people out there who seemingly think the same way I do ‚Äì and share (much) of the same opinions that I do.  I live in MA ‚Äì which is populary perceived as a liberal shit-fest,  but I have to say: I know a lot of people out here who lean hard core conservative -and not Neocon Republican conservative.I started getting turned on to people like Vin Suprynowicz and Boston T. Party ‚Äì back about 12-13  years ago when I was (finally) turned into a gun owner by a co-worker.  I had always leaned libertarian/ conservative, never had a problem with gun ownership ‚Äì and have had a problem with ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù since my college  years more than 30  years ago when I spent quite a bit of time falling down the rabbit hole of reading hard core feminist writers such as Andrea Dworkin and others of her ilk.When 9/11 came about ‚Äì I was completely against the war in Iraq.  And argued that one out with people left and right both in person and online. I made a few converts ‚Äì and found that by disseminating what I read to the people I talked to ‚Äì I helped make my case.  So I grew my own personal email propaganda list where I send out my own selection of articles and columns on a daily basis.  I find that doing this regularly over the last 10-11 years has changed the minds of quite a few people, both family and friends.  You‚Äôve been making the list for the last few months BTW since I ran across your site during the election.Still ‚Äì after constantly beating on this stuff for those 10-11 years ‚Äì I was getting sick of it.  The constant drumbeat of leftist bullshit was getting tiresome.  I was seriously considering say eff it ‚Äì and just going back to minding my own business and finding better things to do with my time.Then Trump started really making traction ‚Äì and I started seeing almost the exact same sentiments and opinions and beliefs I‚Äôve been holding for a few decades ‚Äì showing up everywhere on the internet.  From opposition to the Iraq war , to opposition to taxes, to recognition that feminism is a cancer ‚Äì and a whole host of other subjects ‚Äì I have to admit it took me a little by surprise that so many people seemed to suddenly share these opinions.Why did this happen?I don‚Äôt know.  Was it all just bubbling under the surface all this time?  I don‚Äôt really think that is it. I think there are people out there who have been hammering this stuff home for decades now.  Between a proliferation of ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and libertarian type sites ‚Äì to the candidacy of Ron Paul ‚Äì to InfoWars ‚Äì and a whole host of other things ‚Äì I think that gradual change  you referred to was there bubbling under the surface for quite some time.  It probably would NOT have bubbled over without Trump.  Trump is unique .  Ron Paul couldn‚Äôt get the pot boiling enough to get traction ‚Äì maybe because he comes across as too nice of a guy.  But I think him getting screwed over the way he did ‚Äì opened a LOT of people‚Äôs eyes.  So he too helped us all travel the path to get us where we are today.We‚Äôre going to have to keep the pressure up on Trump. My assessment of him is that he WILL take on the beast of government ‚Äì if he knows he has people behind him. With any luck we‚Äôll see some rapid change over the next year or two.  I won‚Äôt surprised if he is taken out somehow or nullified so that he cannot accomplish anything.  I guess we‚Äôll have to wait and see how it all plays out.

            that simply isn‚Äôt a given.  there are many examples of societies making huge changes of direction, in a short time.   do not discount Trump‚Äôs immense personal charisma; he will draw the herd to his cause like moths to the moon (they won‚Äôt even know why they are doing it).

        Yankeedom has made a wreck of this country. A hell of a lot of evil has originated there, including particularly the importation of Prussian schooling into America. I will not be sad to see those bastards fall on their face.

        I stopped reading TNI, for the most part, about 10 years ago.At that time, I thought of it as a sort of Reaganaut foreign policy journal that had evolved toward neocon as many foreign policy Reaganauts had done [I continue to think of Reagan‚Äôs foreign policy, explicitly ideological, crusading, and ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô-oriented though it was, as more about winning the Cold War and not quite as much about a new world order or spreading democracy everywhere; he seemed not quite realist, not quite neocon], and then in the 2000s had seemingly recoiled from the neocon message as it seemed to sputter under Bush.TNI in that era at one point seemed to go full-Eurasianist, publishing writers like Daniel Larison. At the time, I didn‚Äôt care for that. In retrospect, I‚Äôm more sympathetic. I don‚Äôt really know what happened to Larison or any of those writers, and am susprised to hear TNI again characterized as neocon.I rather thought of The American Interest as the neocon organ, almost as if founded by TNI defectors. Maybe it was, I don‚Äôt quite recall.Oddly, I find TAI more sympatico whenever I turn to either.Guess I have a long wait for a national-interest based American Realist house journal to emerge. Where is the ghost of Nixon hanging out?

The distinction is the long ago screw up of the Daily Telegraph website that required me to open a new account. Circa 2008. The internet casts a long shadow.

            Excellent refutation of the neocon loonies.Reagan‚Äôs pragmatic goal- prevent a nuclear war- became open-ended utopianism.Gods I hate that shrieking preacher, Mark Levin, trying to sacralize Reagan and the Founders.  Myth isn‚Äôt a practical policy guide based on past example.Thumbs up for mentioning a patriotic American, President Nixon.He tried every form of compromise, yet was still savaged by the neocon-Left for shutting down their Asian money machine and line item vetoing their corruption.John Dean‚Äôs wife ran a whorehouse out of DNC headquarters across the street from the Watergate hotel, and the Dem Congress pushed thru the 1974 Omnibus Budget Act, giving the fedgov unlimited spending.  The Dem rats dropped a dime to the plumbers, and the media sprang the trap.With Schumer making JFK noises, beware, Trump, beware the ides of March.The intel agencies- half of which were never for America‚Äôs interest since their beginning- are about to be purged by Trump of the civilian scabs who have ruined our brand.He‚Äôs planning to replace them with military patriots who understand that the proper role of the agencies is ‚ÄúAmerica first!‚ÄùThat‚Äôs why Wiesner‚Äôs Wurlitzer is cranking out the tunes again.With the groomed mole spider taking his place in the dark pool web, the Left doesn‚Äôt need to be in power if their goal is disruption.Obamacare, for example, was never meant to work.  Pure Cloward-Piven, a government system meant to collapse under overload- with the takeover ‚Äòsolution‚Äô positions preplaced, waiting in the wings.Obama‚Äôs first day of ‚Äòprivate citizen‚Äô- unmonitored activity- echoed his ‚Äògolf vacations‚Äô.  His golf trips coincidentally took place by the homes of rich, gay Democrats.He met two homosexual  billionaires on his ‚Äòfirst day‚Äô.This is an underground network of mutual understandings and face to face messaging.These radicals just choreographed a global demonstration of power in 673 cities.Think tranny bathrooms were bad?We have pussyhats putting women in hijab in the front of a women‚Äôs rights march.These people are totally, batshit crazy.
