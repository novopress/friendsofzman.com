        The same people who are sobbing about government workers being fired spent years advocating for people like me who refused the covid shot to be fired. They almost managed to do it. I have no sympathy for any of these people.

            Nor did they care when Bill Clinton was the one doing the firing.  Clinton fired 400,000 federal employees.

                Many people suffer from this.  Both left and right.  Trumps tax cuts in his first term and probably this term will be like covid checks.  The corporations will get the lion share of the stimulus and the people will get crumbs.

                    The average Republican voter has had his mind warped by decades of conservative grifters chanting “lower taxes!!!”
Every Republican Congress raises spending, increases the “debt ceiling” and cares nothing of so-called fiscal responsibility when they have the power.
Taxes need to go up on everyone from the wealthy to the working class.  Granted, we will likely never get a (real) budget surplus or pay down the debt, but we should at least pretend were doing it.  The Japs, Chinese, Saudis, the ECB, the BOE, these people all want their money.

                        Downvotes notwithstanding, you’re right. Up to now they have mostly just talked aboutgetting federal spending under control, while actually cutting taxes as if they had. Interest payments increasingly eat up the budget. Weimar-level inflation represents an easy way out. Tax rates should be the least of our worries.

                They also didn’t care when Clinton sent cops armed with machine guns to deport screaming children at gunpoint to communist Cuba. One can only imagine the outcry if Trump’s people were doing this:

                        Clinton was the result of the party trying to get itself righted after 12 years in the wilderness.  Unfortunately, they picked a guy who was utterly corrupt and his wife utterly criminal.  These people stole close to $200,000 in furniture from the WH in early 2001 and never returned nor paid for most of it.The policies were a response to the Contract with America.  We were a different country then.The Clinton’s normalized criminality in office.  The popularized it, in fact.  We as a nation never recovered.Trump did the thing Ross Perot ought to have done: run for the GOP nomination and not a 3rd party.  If Ross Perot runs alongside Pat Buchannan in 1991, we probably don’t get the Clinton’s.

                    That was a tough call.  The direct blood line was Elian’s father in Cuba.  I was torn myself.  It really is a conservative thing to return a direct descendant.  Isn’t one of the things we hear tirelessly is how a father’s right to his children are ignored by the courts here in the feminist kingdom of the USA?

                        Yeah, but they could have reversed that and made it a case to have the father liberated from Cuba.  That was always my beef with it.  They just accepted the words of a guy held hostage in Cuba.  Even if the father believed it, his wishes should have been assumed to be under the threat of death by the Castro’s.We could have done a prisoner exchange type thing and freed the father to come to Miami instead.  If he gets here, stays a few weeks, and decides to return to Cooba with his son, the whole thing would have ended largely without incident.Instead…we got one of the many Jack Boot demonstrations by Janet Reno’s FBI.

            I was watching some clip of a young hussy sobbing about losing her government job. “This is my dream job and it’s being taken away by an administration that doesn’t care about science!!!” My amusement could not be overstated.  Who would have thought that a lifetime of being sheltered from reality might lead to this type of hysterical behavior.  It may sound harsh, but hardship and suffering would do people like her a lot of good.

Okay, the smart asses at “Nature” are now forbidding deep links to both the HTML article and to the PDF file.
There’s a special place in hell for smart asses who obstruct deep links.
Anyway, let’s try an indirect link to the story; we’ll travel through TinyURL and Bing:
https://tinyurl.com/yc2xjw7u
Once you pass through that TinyURL, and get to the Bing links, you can then click into the “Nature” article itself, and save a copy of both the HTML and PDF versions of the “Nature” story.

Not sure I agree with your interpretation.  30+ is the tail end of fertility in women.  The closer to 40 the more difficult pregnancy gets and birth defects like Downs increase in probability.  Peak is probably more like 18-28 years old.  I don’t see any reference in the study indicating that the rates are better or worse.  They even say that 90% of women report being seen for perimenopause in these younger age brackets.

                    Vizzini: “Um, no, not by any measure.“
Classically, as recently as a century ago, our women had very strong fertility, and bore multiple children well into their late 40s.
But then we got (((Birth Control Pills))).
A bish who isn’t a total slut shouldn’t have any trouble whatsoever pushing out four or five children in her thirties.
But if she started on BCPs in her early teens, then  all bets are off the table.

        Between election and swearing-in, the Grrls screamed bloody murder: Orangester will hunt us all down and lock us up!This, as you say, reflects their souls, displaying what they’d like to do to you and me, and in fact what they did after J6; the Left sees the Right as the hated enemy, but the Right sees the Left as misguided. Oh noes! We’re being hunted! is sure to push the Protection Button in millions of U.S. men.The result is the Right never punishes the Left for its criminal and totalitarian conduct. Like Trump, on election night 2016, pardoning Hillary as soon as the count was in. That gave the Left a green light to go forward with any and every malevolence they could conjure. Which is exactly what they did.The fact that the Left is largely a female/feminist entity rarely is admitted, much less examined. This truth makes men uncomfortable.Yet it’s at the heart of why the Right cucks on dealing with the Left justly. The men of America no more can punish the Prog Totalitarians than they can punish their own daughters, because both largely are the same group. Females in America largely live without consequence for their actions, in comparison to males.Without swift consequences for doing evil, evil abides, regains strength, and returns.

            Unless there are thousands(10s of thousands?, 100s of thousands?) arrests, trials and convictions nothing of consequence will change. Given that majority of the prosecutors, law enforcement, and judiciary went along with and/or participated in the whole scam and are still in place who will enforce “the Law”.

Are you being sarcastic, or trying your hand at irony?
Your premise, if genuine, is that blacks are the way they are either because of something Whites do TO them, or something Whites fail to do FOR them.
But the truth is otherwise.

They (foolishly) did that so they could show that they were kinder and more generous than the hated US, that if blacks were liberated from Sheriff Rainey and Bull Connor they would be just like us, except better.

That “Black Mess” was created by the jews &amp; Unitardians &amp; Quakers which controlled the trans-Atlantic Chattel Slave trade.
The “South” was a completely innocent victim of jewish/Unitardian/Quaker perfidy.

                Perhaps so.But remember, the Left operates by herd dynamics. The instantaneous embrace of Today’s Religion is their strength, but also their weakness.A purge of Leftist leaders — not just political but media, entertainment, so forth — might well stampede the Herd from fear, for that’s their primary motivator, with social status running a close second. Lefties are hall-monitor dictators and cowards, and will cave.After that, they need some type of de-programming to wipe 16 years of Prog indoctrination outta their noggins.  Re-purpose the schools to that task after outlawing the NEA and AFT.I do not believe the will for any of this exists currently in America.  Americans are blissfully ignorant of the spiritual realities of their nation.  Trump’s spiritual advisor is a New Age feminist!  lolI’m just pointing out options should the nation ever become self-aware, masculine and serious.

                    Now yer talkin! The question really does become, “how do we get the girlbosses back out of power,” doesn’t it?We could paint a version of UBI- getting paid for staying out of the rat race (“working”)- in other words, womanhood as it used to be- as the New Liberation.The cost would be far less than make-work jobs, and it would address women’s fears (being stranded) and needs (such as having to pay for childcare or public schooling so she can work/pay taxes).Gasp!  Economic incentives/paying women to get/stay married, instead of rewarding them for divorce or singlehood!Competent women will still do their own thing with niche businesses, as they always have. Lifestyle jobs should be a hobby, as should many university majors. The 80s demand for data entry that ’empowered’ a need for rote office jobs has largely passed, people enter their own information on screens now (rather than transferring it from paper on a dumb terminal.)I’d say that deprogramming will happen the same way it happened: a new list of Goodthink talking points by a new set of status symbols (such as a Trump, Musk, or Vance, manly cowboys in humorous bro ads, etc.,) and they’ll follow right along.After purging the embeds and holdouts, of course, by firings, arrests, etc. casting them as low-status pariahs.Not adverse to “putting Bibles back in school”, that is, stop muzzling the Christians, let them openly and confidently proclaim – the Prog weirdos certainly do.I’d muzzle the Progs for sure, because we’d end the Dept. of Ed and return schools to local control, useful hands-on skillsets, and segregation.

Yes, it does. Gotta get rid of Girlboss Amerika if the nation expects to thrive and survive. They are the heart of the Left.
For one thing, the nation would have to incentivize marriage, as you point out.
Likewise, it must de-incentivize the parents of daughters to send their princesses to college and career. The opposition, of course, would be huge because it would come from both Lefties and Righties.  But it could be done.

This!  Trump can only lose if he gives up and “makes nice”.  If he tries and fails, there is always tomorrow.  If he gives up, there is no tomorrow.  Whatever one thinks of Trump, he rides a sea change in public opinion.

                Julius Caeser’s penchant for magnanimity toward Roman political opponents worked well for him until it didn’t one mid-March. He didn’t survive his post Rubicon reality check. Trump narrowly survived his Ides and had eight years of state sponsored persecutions. He crosses the Rubicon now I think. He is about legacy. He survived the lawfare and summer bullet. I think perhaps gone is the art of the deal guy prepared to let bygones be bygone. I don’t know if he succeeds but it seems he learned the lesson Caesar didn’t get the chance to.

            TheRight has its own playbook.  While leftists shriek and project, the ‘right’ is telling White people that Happy Days Are Here Again.  Don’t worry about anti-White hatred and replacement; an EO has said no more DEI in fedgov so BigCorp will stop hiring H-1bs, stop the interracial advertising, and hire you!  Except, that’s not happening.  Just likeReagan didn’t cut government spending and didn’t stop immigration.  ChrisRufo is overjoyed that soon we’ll all be miscegenated tan/brown, just like his hapa kids, so White guys need to suck it up and go work at Panda Express.This joyous celebration because someone is trying to reform the worst excesses of the system by working within the system is naively premature.  No one is going to jail; no one is going to be eliminated.  The Left will find places for its most devoted acolytes.  TheRight will tell the struggling Whites to pull themselves up by their own boot straps.Same old, same old.

                I see many on our side so optimistic.  Maybe I’ve been disappointed too many times, but I don’t feel that optimism.
We get inspiring words from Homan about deportations, but then I see articles that say that the number of deportations is lower than under Biden.  Who can tell?
Musk tells us he is slashing billions but maybe he’s just pushing hype like he did with electric trucks.
Only time will tell.  I’d like to celebrate.

            This is indeed a problem but I think most men are less hesitant about punishing other people’s daughters – especially when they’re 40+ year old blue haired hags.  No normal man will weep over Nancy Pelosi dangling from a lamp post, nor for the fat HR manager at his workplace.Hard to imagine the needful will be done, but I’ve seen a lot of things happen the last few weeks I thought were impossible.  We’ll see.Much could be accomplished by severely punishing a few of the very worst.  Not many women would have to be hanged before the rest would sober up.  A lot of female pushing is just a quest for boundaries, much like a disobedient dog.  Provide forceful pushback and things quiet down.

Same point I also made elsewhere on this thread.
Decade after decade, the Left identifies its chief enemies as white Christian males. Ok, that tells me this is the demographic they fear. Therefore, white Christian males are the core of your holy army, for even your enemies identify them as such.

                The men must begin by discipling themselves. I agree that a few select female targets will cause the rest to fall in line. But unfortunately much of what passes on this board is not particularly serious in it’s thoughts about gender issues. Female “empowerment” only happens in the vacuum of male irresponsibility and indifference.

                Certainly they had, and have, cultural manipulators which include the intel agencies and the elite families like the Rockefellers.
But women made their own decisions to rebel against God and nature itself.  Nobody held a gun to their heads; indeed, as I witnessed, they were quite willing to force males out of education and employment, and take those slots for themelves (under legally mandated coercion, no less).

        It sure feels like, this week, the leftists found their footing and are back on the offensive. Their attacks are basically the same as they were in 2017. They’re trying to turn Elon Musk into Sean Spicer. The Free World (led by Macron this time) is uniting against Trump. Brave feds are resisting by not sending a requested email. Trump is angry that he keeps losing and just wants to watch the gorilla channel and go to bed. John Leibowitz and Jon Oliver are Speaking Truth to Power in a stunning fashion.Of course the world isn’t what it was in 2017. Even though Russiagate was obviously a stupid hoax, they ran with it 24/7 to manufacture consent and it worked. Nowadays, people can’t watch the media without thinking of the plandemic, the Hunter Biden laptop, etc. A lot of this stuff seems geared more towards the true believers than the normies. Normies seem to broadly support what Trump is doing in a way they did not in 2017. The necessity of action on the federal leviathan, immigration, the MIC, etc. is very obvious.

People are struggling in an economy stuffed full of inflated dollars and don’t want to hear abut USAID sending $50 Million to some Backwaterstan country for queer interpretive dance programs and then being arrogantly told “Well it’s just a drop in the bucket.”Screw. You.People are already taxed to the gills and to find out that if a private citizen or firm did exactly what the government did with USAID money we’d be facing a RICO suit for money laundering ain’t gonna sit too well, especially when it comes out as we pull our tax forms and receipts together.Cut that crap. Fire the deadwood. Slim down budgets, give people their money back, and slam the gates shut.

                    “…only part of our money is being wasted…most of it is simply being stolen or handed out to insiders…”Bingo!  Does anyone really believe $50M for “queer interpretive dance” is a thing?  It’s just a moniker to label a cut of the “swag” going to provide some payoff to who knows whom?  It’s not misdirected funds.  It’s money being stolen and washed.  Pure theft.  Such a scheme is nothing new.  We see such all the time in the private sector where some company’s accountant embezzles company funds.  Hell we had here, in AZ, an *entire* county where the treasurer stole over $30M over a period of *years* before discovery.  Fed’s are just bigger in scope, but no different in effect/process.

For that matter, the Obama’s getting a divorce? I wonder if there’s more to that story as well. Like, you know, Michelle wouldn’t run to save Barry from the noose? We can only dream.

                Normie’s opinion on any subject is neither sought or desired.  They (we) are completely irrelevant.  Factions of the ruling elite want this to happen and that is why it is happening.
What the hell is normie going to do about anything?  Vote harder?  The leviathan has been growing non-stop for 80 years across every administration since FDR regardless of the congressional makeup or who was President.  The only time normie ever gets part of what he wants is when normie and the elite’s desires align.

                    There is a lot of wisdom in what you say. I’ve only seen it mention occasionally since Trump won in november. Stated perhaps in different words there is likely a faction of the plutocracy that became alarmed by the lunacy of the last four or more years. Thus they threw in with Trump hoping to arrest the damage. I wish the effort great success of course, as probably do all readers here. Whether and  to what degree they are successful remains to be seen.

                    “The only time normie ever gets part of what he wants is when normie and the elite’s desires align.”This is true in all times and places and of all forms of government. “Our democracy” was only just a way to let the oligarchs walk down the street in peace while the plebs blamed each other for problems. Pretending the plebs had power when consent could be manufactured was pretty ideal from the POV.That said, the plebs don’t always want the correct things. Mobs are not known for the their intelligent, thoughtful decisions.However, we’re living in a time when the elite are so far gone that they largely out of touch with any reality. The mobs at least know what they are angry about.

                “People are already taxed to the gills and to find out that if a private citizen or firm did exactly what the government did with USAID money we’d be facing a RICO suit for money laundering ain’t gonna sit too well, especially when it comes out as we pull our tax forms and receipts together.”
May I disagree? IMO, the *vast* majority of the population–taxpayers or not–are entirely unaware of any of this stuff and too stupid to understand it if they were.

            They’re yelling but there’s nothing behind it.  Their behavior during Covid was recent enough that they have to leave huge gaps in their complaints.  Formally these gaps would be filled in with regime nonsense but with megaphone gone they’re left with all carrot and no stick, and the carrot is old and nasty.

            Shitlibs were always going to strike back in a more organized way.
But on the only issues that really matter: the Squatamlen invasion, DOGE and ending the Rothschild wars, voters are still strongly in support of Trump.
As long as he doesn’t blink, Trump should get victories on all 3 fronts, regardless of what the shrieking harridans on MSNBC have to say abou it

                I haven’t seem a lot of talk on immigration. It’s become so toxic especially after the last four years, it’s like they finally came to their senses and realized that Americans want these people out, no ifs ands or buts. The focus definitely is on DOGE, because DOGE has a guy on the toop they can target and isolate (as I mentioned, they are trying to turn him into an idiot buffoon like Sean Spicer). After that is Ukraine, portraying Zelenskyyyyyyyyyyyyy as a superhero while Europe is stepping up to fill the void.

                    Problem is that NATO, sans USA, could not even wipe their ass without US toilet paper.  All this nonsense from Macron is just that.  Trump does, or should do, what he wants, signs what is needed and Macron and company will/can do nothing.  Should they decide to take up station in Ukraine, Putin will—as he has since the war began—consider them belligerents and lawful targets of war.  In any event, the USA is out of there wrt military support and Russia can sweep up the rest.
As is said, “The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on”.

                    There is a story floating around that the mercenary entrepreneur Erik Prinz has proposed a plan to the Trump administration to fast track the mass expulsion of millions of illegal aliens using planes and buses on a massive scale. The suggested cost of this plan is $25 billion. The current pace of expulsions will likely rid us of the illegals sometime in the next century, so a plan like Prinz’s is likely the only way to make a significant dent in the illegal population any time soon.

                        I bet the DOGE business, if allowed to play out, will have a larger effect on immigration than any direct policy, by incentivizing people to leave.
I’m sure some percentage of illegals were trafficked here and don’t have the means to leave— they would end up being the focus of policy. I doubt it would cost $25b.
If that story is true, it would amount to another MIC grift. Lol amazing, this system!

            Mycale: “It sure feels like, this week, the leftists found their footing and are back on the offensive.”
OTOH, (((Michelle Trachtenberg))) just kicked the bucket.
“A year before her death, Trachtenberg had responded to comments on Instagram about her health, her weight loss and eyes which appeared to be jaundiced.”
I guess she didn’t receive the Kosher version of the v@xxine.

                She apparently died of complications from a liver transplant. Young women generally don’t need new livers unless they cooked theirs with drugs. One of the channels I listened to suggested liver damage from eating disorders, which is possible. However, heavy drug use tends to keep people thin too.

            The use of Musk in this way is delicious, but structurally unsound. He is successful BECAUSE he lacks the temperament of a cabinet minister, he is loyal to Trump because of the excitement of the role he has been granted, but he will put his foot wrong soon. In fact, he has done so already, and in politics unlike business your enemies can’t be turned back by success following failure.
Imagine if Obama had put Reverend Wright in as grand vizier. We would not have stood for it. Musk needs to work fast, his shelf life won’t be long.

        I’m guessing the average consumer/voter has experienced at least 50% inflation since the Tea Party. The bleating of the media faux “resistance” doesn’t resonate now as folks hunker down at the kitchen table over their eye-popping monthly bills. The ratings, such as they are, contain at least directional truth – look at all the CNN/MSNBC firings. The Washington Post Op/Ed editor resigned yesterday rather than follow Bezos’ directive for more balance. The dogs, whipped by inflation, just aren’t consuming the media “dog food” anymore and the Oligarchs realize it. You just cannot gaslight people after all this inflation.

            More then 50%.  Whatever the CPI states, i’d add at least 2 or 3% to it.  Officially we’ve had 30% inflation since 2020, and all the years since 2008 it was around 1 or 2%.  They saw the turmoil high inflation created in the 70’s and early 80’s and then decided why tell the truth when you can lie and save money on social security payments.  Boskin commission i believe it was.

                It’s actually around double the CPI. There’s a great website called shadow stats that tracks the inflation numbers using the old (more accurate) CPI calculation method (pre Boskin commission in 1995) and compares it to the “new and improved” CPI.

                    It’s always easier to change the measurement scale than to actually change the numbers.  They’ve been doing that since I was a boy—and that’s only what they officially announce under some rubric of “improvement”.  Government economists are worse than whores.

                        This is a great point. There was a great article in, of all places, Politico recently that was talking about the farce of the unemployment numbers (amongst other economic measurements). It was by a former comptroller of the currency, titled “the voters were right about the economy, the numbers were wrong.” WELL worth the read. Some of the numbers on there are stunning, even to pessimistic dissidents. The biggest that stuck out to me was the unemployment number. Now we all know the U-3 is BS, but by his estimation, if you included all the groups that should be included (but are left out of the U-3 headline number) he puts the unemployment rate around 23%. That blew me away.

            Tea Party never stood a chance. It was called nazis, racists, and bigots by the leftist media, in a preview of what was to come as the Great Awokening enveloped our society immediately after. They of course acted like scared boomers always do when called names by their enemies. Then, the conservacuck right swooped in to co-opt it, which it did successfully. Wikipedia has a good rundown of the regime’s side of the story on this. But still I read it and think of how far we have come…

                Ah, yes, the Tea Party! Brings back memories! I was an infuriating thorn in the side of my local Tea Party by constantly bringing up the fact that this was a white people’s movement. Of course they fell all over themselves trying to insist they had a “large tent” and minorities were welcome, but I never saw any at the meetings, which I attended after putting National Alliance literature under the windshield wipers of every car in the parking lot. They threw hissies over this stunt!

                It’s a standard view of /ourguys/, too, as examples of “elite overproduction.”The left/regime/blob (whatever you like) is a closed social circle that excludes almost all whom meritocracy would admit, and those who feel most unjustly excluded—mostbarelyexcluded—are crippled by longing for its embrace. Sailer and Hanania come to mind.If only Stalin knew how clever I am… Actually, great as he is, he must! So I’ll speak always as if into the ear of the throne…Relevant to the news, they’re both great admirers ofalpha trannies, supposedly now getting mass fired from NSA/etc. Hanania held it up as yet another example of how the regime is better and smarter than you jealous losers who’ll regret your stupid prejudice. For years Sailer has been creepily lauding late-in-life MIC/CEO troons, whose last gasp of manhood sees them put on the bully sequins and stomp around the joint, daring anyone to object.Troon psychosis is integral to the “censorship industrial complex.” That’s why it’s been cultivated, putting them to work as humansurveilleurs, obsessive as machines. Seeing some of them possibly actuallyin trouble with the bossis a promising signal, even to the most black-pill-choked among us. So of course it’s a stupid thing only losers would desire.

        It is definitely true that the left always projects. But they end up projecting more for their masters  than for themselvesthey believe everything they are told to believe and get likes for from fellow travelers on social media.We are all the heroes of our own story, no one more so than a female leftist.The white leftist is desperate to be seen as a good, smart person. A primary requirement is to immediately repeat whatever you are told to say. Since they are superior beings, the can’t admit that they are spouting lies or projecting so they convince themselves it is true. They become characters in a play who have lost sight of their just saying lines they have been handed.

                There is a real dichotomy to online dissident discourse. On the one hand, it gets our message out more widely than before. On the other, it diverts our energy from what could often be more effective “meat space” organizing. These things are true simultaneously.

        A fine essay, as usual (and thus, easily taken for granted).In an age where annoying terminology increases and abounds seemingly without constraint, “democracy” is my pick for most annoying term. For one, there ain’t no democracy. All governments of any notable size are oligarchies. Human beings have simply never figured out how to mass-organize in any other fashion. To pretend that power is with the common rabble is utterly silly. And what is American-style so-called democracy in practice? Organized bribery. Big-moneyed interests own all the so-called “representatives” of democracy. While such an arrangement in its current U.S. form may be extremely preferable to a hard tyranny, it probably shouldn’t be over-romanticized.

                        In Plato’s Republic, democracies naturally degrade into tyrannies. Someone in control without votes is not automatically tyrannical. A tyranny is rule that is destructive to the people and the state as whole.

In which respect it is rather like “freedom”. Freedom describes a contingency – Of “freedom” we ask, “OK Freedom. Freedom to do what?”
I mean, the Hutu and the Khmer Rouge won THEIR freedom, didn’t they?

                I suppose it would depend on the specific tyranny. Look, I’m not the type of fella who would trust the people allegedly in charge even if they claimed to be entirely on my side.

                        The system still runs with extremely impressive efficiency. There has undoubtedly been an explosion of degeneracy in the past 60 years and far too much lunacy/idiocy/feminine emotivism substituted for basic reason. However, I think rather than dealing with those problems through an explicit tyranny, we’d be better off reintroducing measures such as social ostracism and good old-fashioned judgmentalism. Let’s face it: men allow women to get away with far too much nonsense these days. If men started writing off the problematic women, the problem would begin to solve itself, no overt tyranny required. As the accountable sex, it’s incumbent upon us to reestablish and enforce standards of decency/sanity.

                            Thoughtful option.  The Left, being feminist women mostly, will respond to male ostracism and judgmentalism; they hate these.
But you’d have to break the cohesion of the Herd first and shock them out of the old (feminine) way, into the new (masculine) way.  That means consequences for doing evil.
Otherwise, they’ll re-form the Herd quickly and shelter there, gaining power.

                                The left for a long time was mostly men. Women in public political structures exist mostly in your generation, and the enthusiasm for it is relative contained to Boomers and Gen X. Women don’t respond particularly well to male ostracism/judementalism. It merely turns into cat fights. Such an action itself is effeminate in a man. Masculinity involves the difficult doing that provides for the whole family.

        The “left” screeches because that’s what the left does, but since 2020 they’ve lost a critical mass of oligarchical support (for whatever reason). So that now it’s largely toothless screeching, whereas for a while there it was actually something to be feared. This one baizuo I know, who left me speechless in 2022 (I think it was) when she told me that we live in a right wing dystopia, today could have more of a point. Not that we do, but that there is more substance today to back that claim than there was then. Whether or not “our” oligarchs are truly right wing (another discussion).The Precious clearly went to work from day 1, with a purpose, staffing fedgov in general and the intel agencies in particular with every kind of tranny, homo, and sexual deviant. You could fairly say this was the one of the 3 most successful accomplishments of his presidency (along with enriching medical insurance companies and reigniting our race war). The “deep state” had been there for a long time, with its own agenda, but it wasn’t always hostile to normal people. It was this step which went a long way in turning it earnestly so.

            In a world where every politician, CEO, physician, judge and NFL coach was a nuggra or a deviant, and the only white people alive were wearing shackles or in dungeons, the Leftist would still believe she lives in a righwing dystopia. These people are disturbed mutants. Nothing more, nothing less.

            “but since 2020 they’ve lost a critical mass of oligarchical support”
If you are the ones rigging the vote, you know how the actual vote really is.  Perhaps they’re trying to get in front of something they’ve suppressed for a long time.  We all talk about how the media lies, well perhaps they know that level of lying isn’t possible anymore and still get people but all the devoted to believe?

                    Thesine qua nonof terrorism is the purpositive slaughter of non-combatants. And it applies equally regardless of who’s doing the slaughtering. But this is not to say that military conquest of nations–the neocon/BFE stock in trade–is any less repulsive.

                        I agree with the general definitons. Alas, the real world of combat and other violence rarely allows clear-cut distinction. It make give one the warm fuzzies to have lofty ideals and think that only the bad guys wear black hats. Limited warfare, the kind with clearly-defined militaries battling each other and (for the most part) leaving the civilians uninvolved went out of style by the 19th century — to the extent it ever existed at all.Ideals of gentlemanly warfare are quickly proven wrong, whether it’s the small child bearing a hand grenade running at your position, or the need to weed out the insurgents or their collaborators by any means necessary. Note that I’m not justifying bad behavior on anyone’s part. I’m only saying it’s part and parcel of most war and pretending it doesn’t exist won’t make it go away, and indeed drastically reduces one’s life expectancy in survival situations.

                            Terrorism is generally considered to be an act of the weak against the strong. Either they have the inability to strike military targets so they attack soft targets, or more pejoratively, they hold human life so cheap that they don’t scruple at slaughtering innocents. In this respect, Hiroshima might not qualify as terrorism even though the liquidation of non-combatants was the primary object if not the objective.

                    Terrorism = deliberately targeting civilians to achieve a political goal. Whether that’s on a Pan Am flight, in a Moscow theater, or at Dresden. Freedom fighters are freedom fighters. Terrorists are terrorists. Although some people might lie to confuse the two.

        I run a hobby page with a reasonably large membership. Today I posted a story about the Houston Texans threatening to leave if they don’t get a billion dollars worth of improvements to their 23-year-old stadium. The fact that we have people in government so stupid as to shovel taxpayer money to billionaires for frivolous things like making their Taj Mahal even more Taj Mahal-ier is absolutely ludicrous.(The Cleveland Browns are doing something similar, but I’m a little more sympathetic since they want a dome. I still think trashing a 20-year-old outdoor stadium is a waste, though.)But a comment on my page hammers home how pissed off people are right now who wouldn’t have been not too long ago. A scion of an area chain of car dealerships that went belly up added his commentary which was basically, ” Fvck the billionaire bastards and their minstrel circuses.”In other words, nobody was shoveling money at them to help keep their business alive. Especially after GM’s incompetence was a big reason they were having problems, and then GM cut them off.The gentry class didn’t have any problem with trickle down and billionaires who could build a better mousetrap. Everybody has a huge problem for what constitutes the billionaire class today and how the idiots in government shovel money at them.

        Honestly, anyone who has grand ideas in my opinion is disconnected from reality. I foresee a future of declining resources, conflict for the remaining resources, a declining standard of living, and strife. No on in the current age has a very clear picture of themselves because 99% of our lives are lived in abstraction.  The future looks like the past, with random plagues ginned up by the elites because they think those are a more “humane” way to shrink the population and draw out the timeline resources will last.

I absolutely think you are right about the birthrate. I’ve resisted this conclusion for years. But it’s a drawdown. They are absolutely doing it.

                    Well i assume the elites have “grand ideas” and i don’t expect them to work.  Unless someone finds a denser even cheaper form of energy that is as safe as oil, my visions will play out.  But that doesn’t mean the elites will remain on top.  I understand their thinking to a degree.  They see White westerners as spoiled, and in lots of ways i agree with them but they’re still my people and i have an old belief in loyalty that many lack today.

                        That, but we seem to lose sight that depopulation—with the exception of Africa—is already baked into the cake and will occur anyway.  The problem is two-fold.  One, some elites can’t handle depopulation, and two other elites like Gates can’t wait!  They’ll be a drastic decline in world population by the turn of the century, especially if we turn off the aid to Africa. 9B is the peak we’ll reach.

        I independently arrived at the Opposite Theory about 20 years ago. Like everyone else I watched the left make promises and deliver the exact opposite – but I wrote that off as stupidity and incompetence on their part, whereas the Dissidents seem to ascribe it to deliberate malice. I wonder if it’s not both?

        I have a theory that is sort of an NRX style “just so story” but I think might have some truth to it which is that I think liberals behave like the tribe.Julie Kelly has mentioned how in interviews with the prospective jurors in DC, the often say that they don’t view Trump voters as americans or people they would want there children to marry. Isn’t that kind of like how j— view iranians?Other examples might be how liberals in places where there not the majority often act like spies or as representatives of a diaspora. A shitlib in Nebraska moving to the bay area is sort of a prog aliyah.

        As a mid-tier boomer (I hate to admit) I cannot stand these old brain dead ex-hippie F’s of my generation.  Rote chanting points lapped up from the former legacy media.  No apparent critical thinking skills when it comes to “democracy”, the US government or especially Trump.  They cannot possibly die off soon enough.

            Good point. But whereas the Tea Party disappeared leaving no trace, the Blob, after engulfing Occupy, moved in Occupy’s direction. This was most apparent in the Blob’s corporations.

                For some reason our guys have decided to go along with the lie that Occupy was a co-opted or destroyed populist economic protest, a threat to finance (and/or the Jews) that they thwarted with reactionary “wokeness,” etc. Exactly wrong.Occupy was a memo to corporate re: social organization, a model society founded on anti-whiteness.“The left” is theetiquette armof the regime.Forgetters need to go back and watch some film. E.g., why do we know what “progressive stack” means? Because it wasthe organizing principleof the Occupy teach-in, the new HR handbook made public.The spike in “racism” etc. on Google ngrams—everyone’s evidence of establishment coordination of The Great Awokening, supposedly in panicked reaction to Occupy (we’re all Marxists now)—wasenforcement.To its cynical purveyors, who of coursebecometrue believers, anti-whiteness was a management strategy, first for “campus” management, military and academic, then applied to the general population—by finance capital. Occupy was a demonstrationofits power, not against it.

        These efforts to repeat what worked in the past affirm it.
“Failed efforts” but that is implicit. It is amusing to watch senators and congressmen stand in front of X bureaucracy shaking their fists in the name of the people while one or two dozen people “protest” in solidarity. I knew much of it was astroturf but about all of it is. To those who said eliminate/marginalize about one or two thousand people and this ends–and whom we dismissed–so sorry. Even freakshows had some dignity in that there was an actual audience for them.

        The hammer is coming.  My advice though is that if you live in an area with high levels of Federal workers, that you start thinking about how the coming recession will impact your business.  I don’t mean that like you should fight the cuts.  I mean it like you need to diversify.
