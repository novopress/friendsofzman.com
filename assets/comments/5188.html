        I favor it being a White House op. The primary motive would be joy. The Clinton’s hate Obama as they love themselves, so there is a long and continuous history of Clinton probing and resentments for Obama to pay back. You cannot disrespect The One. This is just a final slap down of both Clinton’s, and, as you, say, leaving the imaginary high road clear for The One in perpetuity.The fact the Hillary would take a job in the enemy camp and that the party of Obama would have here there exemplifies the grossness of politics at an extreme end in the same way that the Clinton’s marriage exemplifies marriage–or the Obama’s for that matter. This entire democratic process is reality tv now, 24-7. Maybe Trump is the only credible candidate, considering our fake political arrangements.

        Team Clinton Inc. said mean things about BO in the campaign for the Democratic Primary 8 years ago.  See: Birther, Lack of experience, voting present, etc.  Teh won did not forget and payback is a _itch. He is a small man. Also agree with Joseph K,  the crumble is about to happen so let’s pin it on the Republicans and preserve O’s “legacy”.  Also, crazy is not a requirement for leadership but it doesn’t hurt either.

            Payback time.  People forget that the Birther meme started in the bowels of the Clinton campaign. The Clinton operation finally may have met a team more ruthlessly vituperative and vengeful than they.

                In sports, it is not unusual for a great coach to nosedive later in the career, after their top assistants have moved on to other jobs. Musical acts often run into this trouble. The original band, manager and producer make a great team for a while. Then some members go solo and the producer moves onto other projects. The magic is gone and that’s it. Politics is a similar bag. It’s not called Hollywood for ugly people by accident.Team Clinton no longer has the top-shelf talent on staff. A Lanny Davis would have made sure there was plenty of distance between this caper and the boss. He would have made sure never used the e-mail service. Instead, assistants would have sent and received e-mail on her behalf. Old pros know that you never write when you can speak and you don’t speak if you can nod. Hillary is now surrounded by amateurs.

        Reading between your lines, I deduce that you are part of the conspiracy. One of the conspiracies, anyhow. I’m not sure which one, but I’m watching, now, for further data.

        I like the idea that someone is too crazy to be considered a “serious alternative.” As far as I can see in politics, that has never been a barrier.The UK’s Liebore party is set to elect a man as leader who wants to befriend terrorist-sponsoring organisations, crucifying people with money and generally heaving the lefties even further back into a mythical ‘dream’ that soon develops horns and an arrow-pointed tail. Most people think it is too crazy to even consider such thing, but he may well win handsomely.As the US appears to have either come close to or actually chosen various crazies over the years (albeit smiling and subtle crazies, which may be the worse kind) then I can’t see what the objection to Biden is.

            There’s crazy, as in you have silly ideas about the world, and then there’s crazy, as in you have different silly ideas in your head at any given moment. It’s the difference between chaotic evil and lawful evil. You can work around someone who is predictably nuts. Biden jumps from one crackpot thing to the next without rhyme or reason. He was picked for Veep because he made Obama impeachment proof. Nothing Obama did would warrant the risk of Biden getting the top job.Biden is an amiable guy and generally harmless because people around him make sure he is never handling anything dangerous. That’s been the case since he arrived in Washington. If he is made the nominee, it means the party knows there is no chance he can win. Given the circus in the GOP, that’s too big of a risk.

        If I am going to go full conspiracy here I’d say that the point behind this operation is to put GOP Inc. back in the White House for a spell.  The Democrats would much rather see things fall apart on the Republicans’ watch, and the shit is going to hit the fan soon.  Obamacare needs to collapse to get us to single-payer, as planned; the Israelis are going to hit Iran; China will implode taking down half the world economy; an oil price collapse will cause chaos across the Middle East and in Russia; the Saudi Monarchy could fall.  Not to mention the GOP will be needed to finally pass amnesty and get that Pacific Trade deal done so that the concept of national sovereignty can finally be put to bed.  The Democrats have done the heavy lifting for 8 years; time for GOP Inc. to do its part.

        Nixon was undone by Nixon. He dipped his toe into the cover up and the proof was on the tapes. Not legal beyond a reasonable doubt proof, but enough guarded conversation and direction to make the impeachment charges plausible. Without the tapes he could have survived. Most likely if he had destroyed them, even after their existence was revealed, he could have survived. Once they became a subject for the courts, he was screwed because then it really would be a crime, destroying evidence. In spite of his intelligence he failed to appreciate how badly his opponents wanted to see him in the dock. He was right, previous presidents had engaged in even worse acts. But he wasn’t FDR or JFK. He was the guy who exposed Hiss and he was going to be made to pay for his sin.
