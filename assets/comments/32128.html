        The reason neither side is putting out a coherent plan for the future is that it doesn’t exist. The Left wants to rule over a country that functions like it did in 1985 but looks like a Bennetton commercial. That won’t work, and, deep down, they know it.The Right is hoping that non-whites will discover Natural Rights and start acting white. (No joke, Sailer has said this is what he expects would happen if the Left would just stop with the identity politics stuff.)Obviously, neither of these are going to happen. The only ways forward are rough looking. You either get Brazil or you get some form of separation – not civil war, just states and regions taking on a lot more control as the federal govt fades in people’s lives. The national elite doesn’t want to rule Brazil, nor do they want to give up their power to state or regional elites.

            Their plans aren’t coherent beyond “diverse, inclusive, and prosperous liberal democracy” (Dems) or just “line go up” (GOP). That’s because they can’t be…the country is too big. Even if we were 88% white like we were in the 60s, a country of 350 million can’t get along well. Europe fought some nasty brother wars when they were all the kind of mono-ethnic nationalist paradises that we here on the DR pine for. So ethnic enclaves isn’t necessarily the path to peace.What seems to be the common denominator is population and density. The bigger the both, the more strife there is. Simple as. I think many of our problems will be solved when the world has 4 billion as opposed to 8, and the US has 150 mil as opposed to 400 mil.

                The only reason we’re 350 million is because we’re NOT 88% white.
Crowding is one thing, diversity is another, but crowding because diversity?Look out below.(Oh, wait, that’s us.  Look out above.)

                China seems to be managing their big population pretty well, but their leading ideology is something like a Confucian national socialism. Also, it is easier to manage a nation that believes in their future. Americans, and westerners in general, know that the future sucks. Even the wokest believers of the new gay religion can feel it deep in their meager souls.

                    It’s easier to manage a country that is one ethnic group [for all practical purposes].  That’s why America can’t rebound and China will do well.
China wants to go to the moon to put a Chinaman/woman on the moon.  The U.S. wants to go back to the moon to put a black and a woman on the moon.
Advantage China.

                            For some timely lulz—
I was on a large call today with NASA headed up by Rachel Levine’s brother basically (egregiously male presenting tranny), lots of blackety black administrators that control the multi-billion dollar budget, and some lefty middle aged cat ladies. That is “NASA” as it stands in 2024. A hollowed out husk.

                                Yep, NASA cannot even create a *new* idea—thus the return to the moon stunt.  One that is bound to unimpress.  Can’t wait for them to announce the lunar voyage “diverse” crew.  Now that will be impressive.  I’d say one woman, one Black, one White, and an Asian twofer from Japan.

That’s probably why whoever it was [presumably an handful of patriots in the Pentagon/NSA] created the Elon Musk phenomenon; likely they could see the handwriting on the wall, and they knew that if we were to stick with DEI, then the Russians &amp; the Chinese would walk all over us.
Ergo thePentagon/NSA Bros surreptitiouslycreated Elon Musk, so that Elon could do what FedGov could no longer do.

Their fear will grow causing more draconian measures to enforce conformity.  Eventually when normie has nothing to lose, well…. A solution might actually present itself.

                True. As the system doesn’t run as well as it did in the past and their multi-everything utopia doesn’t emerge, our rulers will get more and more authoritarian. But, as you say, it won’t work. Indeed, it will only push things forward more quickly.

A blessing in disguise.  Can you imagine the existential pain of knowing the past and being forced to live in such a dystopian future?  Reads like the euthanasia scene from “Soylent Green”:

                    Yes. But an ever shrinking portion of Whites and Asians will be able to afford this life. Whites are also being cut off from opportunity and will frankly struggle to compete. We are suited for innovation and exploration, not test taking and credential acquisition. The world as it is constructed favors the latter and thus not Whites.I live in an enclave where wealthy Ashkenazi are being rapidly replaced by East Asians. At the same time, Obama/Soros/Globocorp’s Section8 and low-income housing are also sprinkling in ever larger numbers of people who would never have been in here even recently. I wonder what will happen when some drunk SoAmerIndian harasses young girls going to and fro along the synagogue row or outside of the bubble tea shop.It is quite possible that this aspect of their project makes even their enclaves Lord of The Flies scenarios. Wilmot Robertson said these people have never proven themselves able to run a civilization. I see confirmation of that opinion every day. Moreover, the upper middle class may appear solid, but that can change and change quickly.Things are getting stranger by the day.

Whites could choose a lifestyle less focused on credentials, but largely don’t. And when we do, end up having to pay the college loans for those who did chase the credentials.
We could choose to avoid the financialization, even though it means we will never be truly wealthy. We could choose to avoid the blue hives and have a life more like what we claim to prefer.
We just don’t.

                The problem, as Z has repeatedly noted is that Brazil wasalwaysBrazil and there is no structure or institution in that nation that wasn’t put together by Brazil.  The equivalent would be if space aliens visited Brazil, changed out everything in their country with Japanese infrastructure and institutions, and then left.

                    Evil Sandmich:  Excellent point.  Brazil evolved to be what it is, with the demographics it has.  Plus it aspired to ape the White world, and actually received some financial and population from that world.  As Alzaebo notes, when all the world is Lagos, there is no help coming from anywhere.

                    Exactly. Brazil has Brazilian ways of working. They work in a suboptimal way, but they kind of work.Living in Central America, you can find a car cheap. They take shocked or old cars from the US, they fix it here very cheaply and you have a car like new, much cheaper than the States. So, even if people is poor compared to the States can afford a car.In US, you will be poor but the cars will be expensive because safety rules, climate change and so on.Here we have shitty public services and low taxes. You will have shitty public services and high taxes. And so on and so forth.This is why this attitude about “we are going to be a shithole, like Latin America” is fundamentally wrong

This observation appears to allude the vast majority of Jews, particularly those in places of power and influence.

            Citizen:  Thing is, demographically we already are Brazil; people just don’t want to face it and admit it.  After I mentioned the black mayor of St. Paul having his student loan paid off by Biden, my husband looked up the St. Paul demographics – less than 50% non-hispanic White (and as usual, that will include Juice, Arabs, etc.).  In 1970 it was 94% White.The past is a different country – Iremember it well – and all the seeds of today’s poisoned fruit had already been sown and had taken root.  Yet all we get are appeals to a faux-past of equality and magically-powerful documents.  Laws, institutions, systems – they are all reflections of the culture and genetics of the people, as you well know.But most people will not face this reality.  And the few who will are still loathe to take concrete steps to insulate their lives and plan for the unavoidable dystopian reality that their children will be forced to navigate.

                This ^^^.  The retards claiming that the pendulum will swing back are not understanding that there are no longer “Americans” left to swing it back.  The left has won, and there is nothing in sight to show that this will ever change.  This isn’t the movies, and the good guys don’t always win.  The left has already won.  We keep talking about how eventually their house of cards will collapse, but will it?  When you have removed the founding stock nearly completely, who is going to lead a charge to return to normalcy?  Hispanics?  Asians?  It’s not happening.All things must end, even America, and that it has.  What’s remaining at this time is the last few remnants of a forgotten country.  People who still think they live in the land of the free and home of the brave.  America is just a strip mall now, being looted by the low IQ, feral black and brown savages that have conquered the country.  I see a lot of what happened in South Africa happening here.  Violence against White people is permitted and encouraged, systems collapse because blacks are fucking retards and can’t build or manage anything, and all of our institutions have been destroyed.  A civil war, as horrible as it may be, would probably be the best outcome, as there might be a chance of a victory and something new to come along.  It’s not going to happen though, and I don’t see anything coming along to fix things.  All of Europe is on the same path, and White genocide is being committed at every turn.  White children born today will live a life of misery and persecution, and what’s worse is that their parents seem to welcome it.  It is more important to profess your piety to the new religion than it is to care for your own children.  At this point, send the meteor…

                    Tired Citizen:  “This isn’t the movies, and the good guys don’t always win.”  Preach.  Only Pollyannas accuse this of being ‘black pilling.’  AINO is running on fumes.  Yes, there is a lot ofruin in a nation  . . . but thatruin has been ongoing and accelerating for more than 60 years.  And for those who want to point to how long the roman empire staggered on, I point to the pace of change in the last 10, and the last 20 years.  Cultural and demographic change on steroids within a vast and fragile system.  Whether there is some sort of catastrophic crash is not the point – we are living through a slower-motion crash, but the denouement will be the same.

            The Left wants to rule over a country that functions like it did in 1985 but looks like a Bennetton commercial.I really don’t think so.They want anything from, resembling, or reminding anyone of 1985, including Benetton—early, “optimistic” globohomo—obliterated forever in an orgy of total pain. Theyenjoyrule because it allows them to rain injury from above, to be the world’s sadistic “top,” but that’s not the end. Theirrecoverability of everythingis.They don’t even bother making utopian promises anymore. The future has no character except that in it you—Whiteness™—are dead, enslaved, and/or genetically swamped forever.Regime propaganda has been so effective, the vision of the average Democratic voter is more murderous than Pol Pot’s. Their leaders areholding them back. The “next” generation—the already installed regime-in-waiting exemplified by, e.g., AOC—will not. They’re average Democratic voters.

            As divulged today, a drugs panel of “experts” declined to recommend MDMA for approval as an exploratory therapy for PTSD. A primary rationale stated for the decision, and announced by a xir, was too many participants in the trials, which were somewhat successful, were white. “Not enough POC were included and so we don’t want to favor this one demographic over the others.” Literally clownworld.

            There was an HBO show a couple years back called, “The Young Pope,” and one of the story lines was about a cardinal who gets fed up with the young pope and decides to flee back to his old see in Honduras or someplace. The main reason being that he wanted to go back and bang this smokin’ hot chick he was banging before he went to Rome, except the hot chick was married to a devout narco, who happened to find out what was happening.&gt; Do you know who I am?&gt; Yes. You’re Carlos Garcia.&gt; And do you know what I do for a living?&gt; I’ve heard that you’re a narco.&gt; No, I’m not just any narco. I’m the biggest narco around.

        I get annoyed with all the “cycles of history” talk that many on the right like Hunter Wallace of Occidental Dissent use.
If there are any cycles of history they seem exclusive to White countries and Chinese dynasties.
Looking at places like South America and Africa, I don’t see many cycles there.

            Yeah, if I have to hear someone talk about the 4th turning again, it’s going to get physical. Whenever someone brings that up, I always mention that even if that theory is correct, it applied to white people. Why do they think that a bunch of Hispanics, blacks, Asians and Indians are going to act like white people.

                Agreed. Not only that, the 4th turning has so many holes and inadequacies that it is worse than jibberish in terms of explaining what happened, what may happen and why.
There is this cycle you see, and it runs in this time frame. Now we are going back to this portion of it because it has been that many years.
It is just rubbish that is more evidence of what happens in a society where mass men write books for mass men. Garbage.

                        i believe history does cycle.  but not necessarily as depicted here.  first proof.  name one form of government that has not failed.  second proof.  the natural man is an enemy to god.  meaning a man naturally has no moral code.  time and time again men have put away the moral code to foolish endeavor (like wealth or power over other men).  it is a viscous cycle of failure then re learning the same old lesson of integrity of morals.  meanwhile, governments fail, people starve, world wars . .. . its the same shxxt driven cycle.if you lived in russia, would you want america to build up arsenal on its border?  no, just like americans dont want russians building up in cuba.  and somehow american powers think american arsenal used against russia and in russia will go unnoticed.  its the same tired game of trying to get one over and leads to war or extinction if nuclear.mankind knows nothing and will self destruct as nature intended men to kill to their own demise, but man being a stubborn creature will rise from the ashes to begin the cycle again as near neanderthal thought.  then some smart near neanderthal asks “why are we killing each other lets work together.”   bla blah blah. its a cycle.

                                yes, hard times make strong men.  I’m referring to the longer cycle of civil self destruction over thousands of years civilization after civilization lost.  the surge to civility and innovation then the collapse.  i do not think mankind is capable of maintaining a civil technologically advanced society long term.  the perversion of civility is always present and awaits the embrace of man in the end.  its as if some greater force (devil, evolutionary time bomb, failure to recognize  ….) is bent on man remaining a knuckle dragging ape after all mans efforts to lift himself up. i believe the cause is mankind’s failure see the big picture of infinity.  meaning every creature here on earth is a treasure to be given great care and love, managed in a responsible manner (see the failure of government).  there are no others as far as we can see into the darkness of infinity, yet we kill and fight each other like animals.  for what?  to start over from the ashes.  we need to smarten up and put away the natural man,recognize/avert the path to civil destruction andembrace the moral code of civility long term.  we can talk about it some more in a thousand years after the restart if man has not gone extinct.

            This is exactly why I want to shake conservatards I know who say, “the pendulum will swing back the other way”.
No, it won’t.  They cannot accept the fact that they’ve lost their country, and it is gone forever.  It is never coming back.

                Strictly speaking, I agree. Though all it would take to fix things is for the productive class who do useful work to “quiet quit”. Once food stops flowing into the hives, things will sort themselves out right quick.
So when could that happen? I think maybe those who have no recollection of the ’70s might be able to do it. The rest of us are all either hopelessly damaged goods, or have hope that with the right ideas, we can make America great again.

                The “pendulum,” with one brief exception, has been rocketing leftward for about 60 years and is only accelerating in that direction. In fact, there is no pendulum, only a flamethrower running on an inexhaustible supply of Leftism.

                    The whole pendulum argument stems from the changing fortunes of the two parties.
The retards who attempt to make that argument, never bother to consider that one side never advances its supposed agenda when in power.

                    I read a Twitter thread the other day about how support for “gay marriage” and “gay rights” are dropping for the first time in, well, ever. But so what? Congress near unanimously enshrined this into law. Nobody can voice opposition to “gay marriage” and get a job in corporate America or the government. At best, the people who say the pendulum is swinging back now say, “well, if you choose to be transgender that’s fine, but don’t talk to kids about it.” That is no pendulum.

        Leave 1976 behind? We can’t even leave 1938 behind! Every new boogeyman is Hitler, and everyone who suggests restraint, diplomacy, and sanity is Neville Chamberlain appeasing him with “peace in our time”. Every candidate or aspirant for any prominent office must go through a formal ceremony of disavowing our enemies from World War II, as if we expect the Third Reich to somehow pop back into existence any time now. When will World War II finally be allowed to be over, consigned to the history books and placed in the care of the historians?Not only that, but we have never moved on from the Cold War, either, and are told that we must treat modern-day Russia as if it was still the Soviet Union of 1963. Forget what we all saw on our televisions 30 years ago! We must act as if nothing has changed at all. And now, apparently, we must start re-litigating the War Between The States, tearing open old wounds long thought permanently healed.The United States has no future, because like an old man sitting in a rocking chair on his porch, it is living in the past, obsessed with the stories of its long-ago glory days.

            “The United States has no future, because like an old man sitting in a rocking chair on his porch, it is living in the past, obsessed with the stories of its long-ago glory days.”
The future will come to find us anyway. Loved the rant, though. Wish I could spread on the Internet.

        Boomers’ parents and grandparents also legalized contraception and abortion, dropping the birth rate from their booming nearly 4.0 to the Boomers’ &lt;2.0. They prevented us from reproducing ourselves. That’s echoing now with the national birth rate about 1.6, and what’s left of white millennials, the unaborted, even lower. It’s hard to “honor your father and mother” when you’re disembodied body parts slipping down the drain in an abortuary.

            Did we lose a billion people in the last three years?Thanks to Big Pharma, there are excess mortality rates and wildly excess miscarriage and infertility rates.But, what is not being counted, are the number of babies NOT being born.Add that in to the casualties, and a real number becomes clear.What I read was that the world population has actually dipped to 6.8 billion.We were at 7.7 billion in 2019.I don’t want the duskies crowding us out to extinction.The capitalist dipsticks can crow about plenty of room, but what breaks down before the resource infrastructure is the social infrastructure.What is the per capita on the loss of white people, outnumbered as we are?The tumorous growth-growth-growth guys didn’t plan for a declining population.If the smart city transhumanist eggheads didn’t solve for a grid collapse, then I’m sure the crash of growth rates is going to catch them by surprise too.Just like the rapidly draining talent pools is catching them by surprise.

                It’s a truism that markets always go up “over time.” This is accepted by pretty much everyone. “Stay invested for your retirement, the market always goes up over time.” I have this idea that it correlates to population, which has always been rising for as long as anyone can remember, since the black plague anyway. When population declines, I think markets always go down “over time” will become the new reality.

                Alzaebo:  Ultimately it doesn’t matter – we cannot outbreed the non-Whites.  Neither can we ‘under live’ them.  Dissidents like to talk about reality – well, nature is a big part of that and it’s a constant battle to the death for resources and survival.  No, human nature has not and will not ‘develop’ past that fact.

            Birth rate is hardly the only factor there. Child mortality (5 and under) dropped from roughly 40 per 1000 in 1950 to 7 per in 2020. Sure, society in the last, say, 50 years doing everything it can to kill or prevent as many babies as it can, and, yet, Millenials are more numerous than Boomers. Some from immigration, sure, but to a large extent, it’s that child mortality dropped by a whopping 83%.

                    Might be. Spiteful mutants tend to spawn from relatively successful whites, who already had decent child mortality numbers. And while the diversity are fecund as heck, they are also wildly disproportionately aborting them.
My point was that if birth rates were identical between 1950 to today, just the decrease of child mortality would represent a 3% increase in population growth. Which largely explains the number of Millenials. Heck, child mortality now is a quarter of what it was for the first of the Xers.

                        My pet theory is that Spiteful Mutants are on the rise as much because of increased assortative high IQ mating as reduced childhood mortality. Confounding factor being that the middle and upper middle classes also have the least childhood mortality and therefore the most mutant-mutant mating pair-ups when they do bother to reproduce.
The rise and apogee of managerialist class-consciousness gives rise to its own internal ‘contradiction’ in that their kids and grandkids exhibit noticeably high fraction of autistic troons and all-round freakouts.

                        Harsh Darwinian selection perfected the species and got us to the level of the Industrial Revolution, which turned the whole phenomenon on its head.  Not sure about spawning from “successful Whites”.  The greater the mutational load—which entails less successful, lower IQ folk as it does successfully Whites—the greater the probability of such mutation being passed on, and added too.  It’s cumulative, albeit random per se.  The only way to reduce it is “harsh Darwinian selection”.

                            Yup, that harsh selection comes in the form of Autist hybrids.Big Nose tribe are lethally focused because they are an autistic race.
Their genetic / cultural strategy combines a means to enforce a core pool reinforcing certain traits such as paranoia, intent, verbal IQ, while boiling off a majority ‘fringe’ into assimilation, resulting in such things as Judeo-Puritans, Khazars, and Islamics.
The extended seeding of such strains may be far, far larger than we thought, thus great swings and hefty leverage of historical “cycles” in the West.

                                The anti-Christian reaction of two millenia likely comes from the possibility that evangelical Judaic cults swept the Roman empire, converting as much as one fifth of the empire’s population.  The abandonment of mandatory circumcision ended a core group restriction and enabled the spread.
Thus, the revenge against Rome is not for the exaggerated “genocide” of 70 AD; but of the upstart Judaic Jesus factions gaining more traction than the supremacist Ebionite factions.
Talmud coalesced in the same centuries New Testament did;Khazaria rose to power at the same time the Islamic Revolution did.  These are Ebionite reactionaries against Romano-Christian rise.

                        Agree with Steve, the child mortality rates is the number I’m not factoring in. Counter to that is the birth defect and disability rates, Zaphod’s Autistic Fertility ratio as well.
“Spiteful mutants tend to spawn from relatively successful whites”- such a good catch. Cross-segination has a limiting ratchet, just as consanguinity does.

            As others have pointed out 3g4me, Tired Citizen, et. al. The time for moats and minefields was 20 years ago. Flamethrowers and machineguns can be used but they will be pointedinwardlyif used and it would be far too messy for the stomach of most people.The enemy isn’t at the gate, he long ago breached the walls and gate, he is your neighbor and -you- are already the minority even if the lying stats do not show it. For some reason many (most?) of you are not getting the memo yet. I guess because it is not within 3-5 blocks of you which I’m told is the ‘effective radius’ for most people to notice a problem.Perhaps I’m “blessed” in that regard, I like Z, have lived many years in a “diverse” area and so have rubbed elbows with the outcome of other people’s poor voting most of my adult life.Now that I’m back in DC for a few months I’m reminded how amazing it is here. My neighborhood it’s own little United Nations basically. I heard 4 language outside my window in the past week, none were English. One was Spanish. Loud music, loud cars, late night conversations on your mobile phone that you think is a megaphone the entire neighborhood should know about. The sidewalk and grass near it is your trash can. Should I go on? All the typical “strengths” that diversity brings.My only consolation is that shortly I will be back on another continent also hearing strange (European) languages, spoken by White people with almost no diversity in sight and I’m hopefully near the end of permanently disconnecting from this sewer other than as an economic zone which is what all the “diversity” comes here for, to carve out some meat from the dying corpse.

                No AP, I hear you.  I’ve lived the vast majority of my life within 100 miles of the beaner border, so am well familiar with the blessings of at least that particular spicy flavor of diversity.  However, you must admit that the sewage flow has been turbocharged in the last few years or so.  The last several times we’ve flown out of town there have been any number of “squatamalens” etc., on every freaking flight – it really is unbelievable and nothing I’ve ever seen before.We just returned from a trip across the pond, and you are right, there are obvious language issues.  But they are with fellow Whites.  Yeah, there are muzzies here and there as well as occasional coal black Africans, but it overall seems a hell of a lot less nastily diverse than say, DFW.Even though it is most likely too late, the three M’s still are an enticing fantasy – along with miles worth of rope for the enablers…

        Today’s ruling elites have a Silicon Valley/Berkeley/Boulderethosabout them. They are David Brooks’ Bobos and Richard Florida’s Creative Class—i.e. aloof, educated, left-leaning hipster techies who are too cool to make it into the office. Steve Jobs was perhaps the most thoroughbred expression of the breed.The culture of the last 30 years, with the rise of neoliberal economics and old Leftist protest-slogans becoming official government policy, has basically been the result of this class imposing their autistic view of reality on the rest of the worldviathe instrumentality of the internet and the image of the tech-enabled individual, smartphone in hand, as the New Prometheus.I never found this class very convincing as an elite, and now it seems their vision is looking increasingly threadbare and perverted. Steve Jobs has degenerated into Sam Bankman-Fried, who is the inevitable culmination of where this project was always heading. The increasing deterioration of the neoliberal worldview will continue to afflict society like a canker until it is swept aside by an example of manhood who doesn’t wear a black turtleneck or long to live in the metaverse.AI is autocorrect on steroids; a nice tool to have if you want quickly generate some copy for a project, but hardly anything to found an economic revival on. The point of diminishing returns in the IT era has been reached, but nobody has a Plan B or even an alternative idea for how to organize an alternative economy. That is the condition predicate of fundamental social change; and when it comes, political change will follow.

            “AI is autocorrect on steroids; a nice tool to have if you want quickly generate some copy for a project, but hardly anything to found an economic revival on.”
Sigh.  You are as ignorant of AI and its potential (good and bad) as you are on HBD.

            Very nice. On the AI bit I would expound a bit. The GAE is all based on managing perception and developing technology that is aimed at propaganda, mass communication and mass deracination.Were we not ruled by usurers and short to non-sighted merchants we would use AI for better purposes. There is a society that is doing that, and it is China. AI and technology aimed at improving things in the physical world can be the basis for economic revival. China has run circles around the GAE in terms of applying technology. They used labor arbitrage and sheisters like Krugman/Friedman/WallStDispossessers to build out a massive manufacturing capability. They wisely spent their human capital and engineering know-how on developing robotics to automate manufacturing as the next step function in efficiency. What they have done and where they are going with it is impressive.Meanwhile, we are run as a junkyard and pawn shop. We offered huge amounts of money to get micro-chip factories back in America. However, we imposed DIE on those companies. They took one look and, after initial excitement to build here, they saw a useless workforce and balked. Those factories opened in Japan and Israel. Cui bono?Yep. Who imposes DIE here may stand to benefit in a relative’s hinterland. Disgusting.

                That’s somewhat the point I was trying to make.  AI is a completely different beast than the generalized computer technology launch of the 80’s of which we are still feeling the effect—socially and economically.  To say that AI is just another application, and a simplistic one at that, is dangerous and I flatly claim ignorant.One need only look at the current nascent AI programs being released/demo’d to see the problems which may arise through such technology use—and then to realize just how such use may become irresistible given the declining intellect of our work force.  Do we really want our children being taught by an AI that is programmed to respond only with “politically correct” answers?

                    Well, saying it is a glorified auto-correct does not mean it is not dangerous.  It could very well become an unremovable, non-optional tyrannical auto-correct that in time could warp perception.  Much like the crappily drawn cartoons that push degeneracy – they are crap, but still dangerous.

        Who knows what the “elites” are doing. It is most likely that whether America remains the hegemon or its empire accelerates its retreat and collapse, they are preparing for either outcome. And what is that? As Biden says, they are here to, “FINISH THE JOB!”That job is the demolition of America and the entire Occident. That demolition has as its cornerstone the demolition of the people of the Occident. They are not building a wall against diversity, they are inviting in the diversity. More people means higher GDP and GDP is their God – the magic number out of the equation from which all good comes. So, no wall is being built. It is eradicated so diversity can Finish The Job. For them, the most important thing to ensure is standing after the demolition is that the GAE and the people who run it ensure that Israel is the highest priority. Ironically, that little piece of The West in the Levant that we were told was so needed because it is Western, is the only place in the supposed West whose people, identity and territorial sovereignty remain sacrosanct and defended.Meanwhile there is Occidental man. Yesterday for me was one of those days needing to sift through many search results. Doing this, you see a huge number of ads. In every ad, I never saw me and my kind. I live in virtual AfroAsia now. Out of curiosity I clicked on a couple of the job ads – what is out there? Every globo-corp careers page has eradicated me and my kind. Diversity is going stronger than ever.Globo-Corpo is committed to this project. I don’t think the government is coercing them. They are all in. Global consumers reign and whitey, you are the global minority, so we’ll employ the consumers of the future, and they are not you. So long.After a long day and success in solving my problem I wanted to relax and indulge in one piece of globo-homo produced culture that I thought would be the perfect escape. For the first season+ it was. It was a 2 season series call Barberien. It is the story of Arminius vs. Rome. It isn’t incredible but it is good. They wanted historical correctness and identity to be so accurate that the dialogue is in two languages. Rome and her translators on both sides speak Latin. Very cool to hear Latin spoken. The German tribes speak German as do the Roman translators.Along comes the newest episode, and one of the protagonists who sacrifices his love and his position in the tribe to make Arminius the King of the tribes comes back into the story. We encounter him anew inside of the Roman garrison and his wife is a sub-saharan African. I groaned and my heart sank. I took the dogs out and told my lady to keep it rolling. I came back in and saw the Negress engaged in a girl-boss scene telling the German tribal Queen what to do. I poured myself a glass of bourbon and went outside to enjoy a nice night on the deck. It is finished. I won’t watch another second of that and accept the lie that in 10 A.D. in the Teutenberg Forest sub-saharans were girl boss tribesman or even tribesman at all.This thing is relentless. The people of Germany, (and all European homelands), are being dispossessed of their homelands and ethnically cleansed. As part of this, we are being erased from all modern day cultural imagery. In addition, in our own stories, our own real history, alien peoples are now substituted. That isn’t some diversity casting initiative. It is way more sinister than that. It is being done to erase our distinct peoples, our distinct stories and our exclusive inheritance and to abrogate our ties and claims on our homelands by giving alien peoples legitimate claims. That is evil and unacceptable.I would guess that 90% of whites in corporate America have no problem with the anti-white pogrom. As long as they are employed and pursuing wealth – it isn’t coming for them. I would guess that 90% of whites in America have no idea how important culture is. My guess is that most look at that and say, hey there were negroes in 10 A.D. Germany. Huh! Cool. I wonder how many Germans remain who have the proper visceral reaction to this evil attack on their heritage and identity.Our problem isn’t a presidential election or a Congressperson. Our problem is, how do we preserve and transmit our very identity so we can remain a people as it is under an unprecedented attack. We have an existential issue to address that is far more important than politics. Look at public schools curriculums and web sites. Tranny-fication is an issue, but it is also a brush fire that distracts from the fact that deeply embedded in the curriculum and the mission of the school is creating a global citizen. The youth will not know nationhood. I talked to some early 30-somethings who went to school in bumble Utah and in school they were told, and happily accept, that they will live in a multi-cultural diverse society. They loved that idea. That was well before 2024.We are in deep deep trouble. The Use and Abuse of History in post-American politics is an issue but it is extremely minor compared to the total deracination and wholesale replacement of our roots as Westernkind across our entire culture.Something is in place that has widespread agreement in the Ruling Regime. That something is the total eradication of identity, white identity above all since it is Occidental Man’s homelands that the conquest is primarily aimed at. No matter who is elected. This project continues.I often wonder what it would take to get a Netflix special that is the story of say David or Moses where the actors portraying the Hebrews are sub-saharan. Cast a pygmy as David who then takes out Goliath and then goes on a rampage circumcising his conquered lands. Wouldn’t that be amazing! I would love to see that if only to see the reaction. I suspect it will be far more intense than the properly expressed outrage that say Egypt expressed when Cleopatra was cast as sub-saharan. Isn’t that sad? Egypt, no longer a Macedonian/Indo-European population, was outraged that Cleopatra was portrayed as a sub-saharan and not Macedonian. Whereas the broken people of The West tolerate outrage after outrage on the deep attacks on our identity.The Use and Abuse of History that is beyond who is elected has roots that are deep and wide and has implications far beyond the clown show of American electoral politics.The task ahead is a heroic one. When Rome fell, Indo-European man had Byzantium as his continuation of the Greco-Roman world, was genetically renewed on the Italian peninsula and had a lock on his ancient homelands throughout the Northwest and east. This time, his own ruling regime and the global cartel that is instituting a new global-corporate-consumer-feudalism is flooding his lands and his very mind with the alien. There is nowhere to run. It can be turned off in your living room, but it takes an act of will to do it. The Barbarians are inside our gates and they are glowing inside of our no-longer exclusive history on every screen.Will we use history and take control of it? If not, we will be severely abused in the coming decades.

            Superb comment! Painfully clear grasp of the overall problem.Relative to framing a theory and plan for an effective response … it seems to me that what “they” are doing to us — what they have already accomplished to this point — is pretty similar to what they see as the great civilizational crime of the white race.  It also seems that they are even more successful at executing this destructive plan against white persons and cultures than was for multiple centuries that civilization they now accuse and destroy.  I mean, at least there were peoples and practices left on the planet that could later be tapped to array as forces against the (now) hated white world …. arrayed, interestingly, by the most successful members of that same white race and culture.Look toward Germany, and what they are consciously, implacably and openly doing to import persons as tools destroy their culture and people.  The cultural self loathing of their globalist elites is clearly driving them to destroy their own people in atonement for racial guilt, and to expunge the crime of their mid-20th century forbearers.And in this larger Western counterstroke, they intend to harness (and have in fact already harnessed) the powers of technology to ensure NO enclave of the former culture remains, no matter how small or non-threatening. They are running a global war of extermination, and cannot themselves seem to see the irony of their beliefs and actions … or more likely, they just don’t care, as their hatred of what they see in the mirror is so great. .And as you point out, they have done so in part through the medium of direct distortion of our culture and history.  Of course, they’ve control now of the whole thing — education, finance, corporate realm, government, et al. So I’m not so dense as to believe that is their sole weapon.  I do believe, though, that it has been for well over a century their most powerful, and insidious one.The story is key to any people, and destroying ours (obviously) is central to their program. They’re the “artsy folk” … living in the world of story and myth creation.  They know it’s probably THE main support of any culture, and they figured out many decades back that to destroy a people, you first had to corrupt, pollute and destroy their story.We must have an effective mechanism to counter this.  I believe tying their current program to that thing at the center of all they do — White Guilt over privilege, supremacy, colonialism — and relentlessly hammering away at that, has to be a central part of any plan for moving forward.Yes, they do not recognize or acknowledge hypocrisy.  They can’t or their worldwide project will be weakened, perhaps fatally.  But it must be done anyway.And yes, it takes a certain obsessed and creative sort of person to conceive, organize and execute such an operation.  Unfortunately, almost all the creative sorts who deal in words and imagery dyed their hair magenta, pierced their genitals and stormed left as their project began to overwhelm our civilization.But without such a counter-effort, we will certainly perish (or “be perished”).

        I sometimes wonder if the people running things actually believe the techno communist future they talk about will actually work with a population of people who can’t even maintain clean water in their own countries. It almost seems like a red herring designed to get people focused on that instead of the looming demographic crisis, whether that’s intentional or not it certainly seems to have that effect. People who believe that’s coming have to also believe the brown hordes will be able to sustain that because of AI. As for me I look at a place like Detroit as a reminder of what happens when blacks are put in charge. Naturally I have a hard time believing anything will overcome their deliberate plan of africanizing society which is already well under way.I’d have a hard time believing it’d work even if they weren’t doing the equivalent of putting termites in charge of maintaining infrastructure. All those green energy plans effectively amount to devolving civilization back to pre-industrial conditions in actual practice. Plus someone has to physically maintain the alleged AI controlled robots that will do everything that the brown people are physically incapable of doing.Meanwhile there’s seems to be an underlying understanding that the whole system is crumbling in real time &amp; there’s only a limited amount of time to take out Russia &amp; China to feed off their corpses. If they were so confident in their future utopia then it wouldn’t have been necessary to kneecap Europe’s economy &amp; agitate for war in an act of desperation.It’s kinda funny to think about, on one hand they’re very concerned about extending the life of their empire that they’ve utterly destroyed through short sighted greed. At the same time they’re utterly beholden &amp; dominated by a nomadic race who’s mode of living entails reducing countries to dust while looting all the wealth &amp; then moving onto the next host. That latter group also has a sub faction who is solely concerned with maintaining a country whose continued existence hinges on the empire existing to protect it but also can’t help but work to destroy said empire. Both of these groups simultaneously want a one world government ruled by them that is utterly anti human &amp; unsustainable by its very nature.If this was a fictional universe it’d be hard to take seriously due to how implausible it is on the face of it but it’s real &amp; we’re living in it. I can totally understand why some people want to believe we exist in a simulation. It’d be far easier to rationalize that it’s all fake rather than trying to wrap one’s head around how this quagmire we’re in was even possible in the first place.

                I had never thought about atheists in regards to simulation theory, seems rather contradictory since presumably someone or something would have to be running the simulation. Maybe I’m reading too much into it though.

                Egads.  Both assume a giant magician outside the box.Neither can explain origination.
Origination is self arising processes, oyster pearls arising from a tiny flaw, accumulating across vast repetitions of the Big Diesel.
The cosmic Ecology is far beyond mind or Mind.  Sapient intelligence and collective intelligence are processes of the organic layer nesting memories into cohering structure, imprinting that structure on biochemical flesh and electromagnetic spectra.  That is the blueprint that, expressing itself, appears to be the work of Reason.

                    The original Origin, when all were formless forces, was time dilation.  What we call gravity, (‘branes’ are today’s external Magician), is whirlpools of time dilation, where one “end” is a micro-picosecond slower, causing another faster “end” to begin swirling in a vortex.  The original Flaw was that ‘nick’ of time.Matter, in the Origin, congealed from its twin Energy.  The arising differences in state led to more details, more fractal differences arising betweenst the two interacting.Physical constants that proved, survived the Cycles of the Big Diesel.  Each one, a note, added to the orchestral that became a symphony of today’s complexity.  Ultra fast cycling slowed to today’s congestion.Our assumed axiom of “everything, all at once”, a vast orchestra necessitating a Creator leaves people looking for a Source; that is like asking to find the first cup of water in an ocean.No need. No First Mover, no Source, because then the koan becomes a search for the Source of the First Mover.  In other words, to ‘prove’ my God is bigger than your God.

        I think the correct metaphor for our impending future can be found in that newly minted medical term that has evolved in the wake of the Covid madness . . . Turbo Cancer. For those of you in the dark on this phenomenon, the mRNA vaccine has now been shown to spawn a new kind of cancer epidemic that has major far-reaching consequences for our species. Specifically, an abnormally high number of young people are now showing up in hospitals with Stage 4 cancers that went undetected until it was too late. No early warning signs of Stage 1 or 2, just straight to a death sentence. Our near future will soon be one of unprecedented surprises of every sort imaginable.

        The people walking through the door are Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Fani Willis, Jasmine Crockett, Cori Bush, Ibram X. Kendi, Scott Wiener, and the rest of the spiteful mutant contingent. It’s a future too horrifying to contemplate. So, it isn’t surprising that the GOP reminisces about the days of Reagan or the California of Saileer’s youth, possibly the greatest place that God and man ever built for a person to live. They are institutionally incapable of resisting this tidal wave of sewage that is coming our way. That’s why the GOP is on its way out and it is going to be replaced by something that can, however long it takes.

        Reagan was just another link in the chain of causality that led to the present.  With the benefit of hindsight, we  know that he helped dismantle America and added some of the worst aspects of libertarian economics to mainstream economics.  Under his leadership, the new industry America invented was outsourced.  It was under his leadership that the financialization of the economy got started.  It was also under his leadership that the consumer debt cycles really kicked off.  He appointed one of the worst fed chairmen in history.Reagan obviously wasn’t all bad and certainly was not the only agent of decay at the time. But he was not the hero certain demographics of people remember him to be.  He was the aspirin and band-aid to our brain cancer.

            I think we need a better term than financialization. Your typical midwit has no concept of its meaning or its consequences. One possible replacement that is more explanatory, but also more cumbersome, is strategically directed inflation.

                I think we need a better term than financialization.what would be the definition of; looting a large and wealthy country so severely that it will be completely destroyed in the end? The removal of industrial capacity has been criminal. Why would a country willingly allow the production of their essential goods to be off shored? Medicine, steel, micro-chips, hi tech tools and devices and weapons are all made for us by other countries. The stupidity of the people in charge is staggering. They have  willingly destroyed us.I have heard people blame greed, envy and a hatred of the country as the reasons behind a lot of the policies. I think it may be a severe lack of imagination of the outcome of their shortsighted policies may be to blame, or just a selfish unimaginable level of stupidity.TPTB seem to believe they will be exempt from the fallout of their policies, no one will exempt.

                    Everyone and his dog has an explanation for the offshoring, but you cannot argue that for whatever reason, there was a hollowing out of US industry. People weren’t buying US cars, (insert ideological reasons) so Gary was shutting down steel production, so the Iron Range taconite processing shut down, and we end up with a Rust Belt.
It’s not greed, unless you think Americans were greedy by not blowing all their savings during a recession.

                        Everyone remembers how hard it was to get the supply chain going to at least some degree after a very short interruption for COVID. And mostly that was just backlog from unloading ships.
Now let that shutdown go on for a decade or more, and the factories and plants producing all the precursors being unable to be started back up under the extant regulatory and environmental policies.
Greed is always a fun answer, because it allows you to feel morally superior, but it’s almost always wrong. Greed wasn’t invented in the 70s.

So far as I know, not one of the Gary steel mills that shut down by the mid ’70s ever fired back up. I saw firsthand the debris of the iron mining industry in Minnesota. The parts that could be sold off are long since gone, the rest slowly rusting away.
I don’t know how much of a role Reagan played in that saga. The requisite industries could not be restarted.

            The financialization of the economy started long before Reagan.  The resulting inflation was tamed by Volker and it took a bad recession to do it.  Millions of people who couldn’t buy a home in the late 70’s suddenly were able to do so.  Deregulation of telecom spawned the miracle of communications we all carry in our pockets.  He also got shot, and then carried 49 states.  Unemployment cratered.  All the stuff we associate visibly with a good economy…was good.Most of the ills you list came later.  The silicon industry was destroyed in the early 2000’s for example.Reagan is a bit like the Kings of Old.  Not a saint, but a remind of what was, and for many people, of what could be again.That hope is a pernicious cancer in people’s minds.  There is no going back.  All we can do now is destroy the current system as illegitimate and try to bring some sanity back to civilization.

                First, this :“resulting inflation was tamed by Volker and it took a bad recession to do it.”is categorically false.  There was inflation throughout the 1980s. The average yearly inflation in the 80s 3.5% and that is using BS numbers of the government. (an item that cost 1 in Dec of 79 was 1.66 in Jan of 1990)  There has been inflation almost every single year since like 1943.  The relatively high inflation of the 1970s continued through the 1980s.  This is despite all of the offshoring.“Millions of people who couldn’t buy a home in the late 70’s suddenly were able to do so.”Yeah, because everyone is just dying for 15% mortgages.This is not even considering the massive housing inflation that has plagued us ever since Volcker (which, admittedly started before him, but he never slowed it down let alone stopped it).No, Reagan nostalgia is people wishing they were living in the 80s again when they were young, had more hair and pop music was better than today (though worse than the 70s).I never denied the decay of the US started before Reagan.  Nor did I say he was the major driver of that change(though he certainly supported it).  But it really picked up in the 80s.  But people forget, their minds clouded by nostalgia.What Reagan really was, was a turn back to relative normalcy in the culture.  All of the open degeneracy and protests and the cultural collapse all seemed to go away during that time until the 2000s.  It was a time of optimism that replaced the “malaise” of the 60s and 70s.

Don’t lie to me, boy. I was there. We chopped f**king wood for 3 months every Fall just to not freeze to death.

Inflation was less, not cured.  3.5 was the average, but there were higher periods in the 80s.  You forget how much of a big spender he was.  HE didn’t appoint Volcker, that was Carter.  HE appointed the worst fed chairman probably in the history of the fed, Mr Greenspan.
Reagan was a mixed bag.  Some was very good, some not so much.  Reagan would have been the first person calling us racist.  Reagan gave us ML Kang day.  His VP was in with the neocons.

                            Tars you need to check those numbers.  I bought my first home in 1981.  The interest rate was 13.1%.  This was common and reflects not a yearly rise of 3+%.  The recession was as usual, 100% the product of the Fed as they needed to choke out the money supply.  Reagan did the hard decision and told Volker to go for it.  It two years (of pain) it was over and we of course remortgaged the home at a respectable rate of around 7%.  Later again at 5% or so.Rates lower than 5% were never heard of before the 90’s and especially the 2000’s.

        Having spent decades successfully deconstructing everything, destroying every parallel institution, and utterly annihilating God, the left (and much of the right) is desperate to replace it with something.
That’s AI.
When I see Sam Altman or Elon Musk rambling on about how AI will save and/or destroy it and therefore must treat “it” very carefully, it’s hard not to think they’re talking about creating another god and determining how to placate it.
They’ll fail.  Unless their actual goal is to bank a very tidy profit.  In which case, they’ve succeeded.

            There’s been a hilarious back and forth between Yann Le Cun (should be Con or Cul, IMHO) on Twitter in the past few days. Won’t go into the whole inside baseball of the thing, but best viewed as a proxy fight between Zuckerberg (Le Cun is piss boy of the month thanks to being an AI luminary employed by Meta) and Musk.

        The future is hot garbage. 1 trillion in debt every 100 days? I had to look up this fact. A million seconds is 12 days. A billion seconds is 31 years. A trillion seconds is 31,688 years. I don’t know how this ends, but I feel we will be fighting over potatoes regardless of who is in charge.

        Whatever the “elite” vision of the future is, they will fall short of realizing it. Dysfunction will prevail. All the WEF/NGO style manipulation is sort of like kneading dough that doesn’t have enough yeast. No matter how hard and earnestly they knead, the bread won’t rise. The power grid won’t be reliable enough to support the dreamed of AI future. If the AI is to have reliable power, then nobody else will. Either it is shut off, or the people it is supposed to reach are shut off. Or the green new deal will have to be abandoned. It will not be abandoned, for it is Holy. So there it is. The parking garages won’t support the EVs. The dieversity won’t be able to maintain basic utilities (that’s the present, not the future). And these geniuses think they can implement CBDC. LOL.On the bright side, we will still have too many Whites to ever reach South Africa levels of dysfunction, barring nuclear war, yellowstone caldera, cascadia subduction zone etc. So the Brazil/Mexico comparisons are probably better, only with a lot more factionalism. Probably too much factionalism to control. The regime will maintain as much power as they are willing to fight for, but my observation is they aren’t willing to fight very much. If at all. This isn’t 1861, where the will and means exist to raise a huge army to force the union together.

                What can be done about it? There’s very little reason for a decent white guy to take a chance on women, and end up giving her the house (but still having to make the payments on it) and paying alimony and child support while he lives in the back seat of his car, or his parents’ basement.
At the very least, that has to be reversed. You divorce him, you get nothing. That will force the issue of women refusing to grow up and reject the bad boys in lieu of the good providers, materially and spiritually.

                    Steve:  While there is plenty of blame to go around on both sides, the majority belongs to the intrinsic nature and behavior of women.  Therefore, current incentives based on the false narrative (i.e. paid maternity leave and baby daycare) merely worsen the problem.  Put the money and incentives in the hands of men, keep women under both behavioral and financial control, and then you might see some progress.https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1767742022301909466.html

                        Interesting. Anecdotal, I know, but I’ve observed the same effect with inheritance that they documented with lottery winnings.
Not sure I agree with their belief (without seeing the data, I have no idea if it supports their conclusion, or if it is just a confirmational bias) that wealth shocks simply facilitate breakups already on the rocks. I think you have to rule out that women in that situation now have options (travel, etc.) that they never thought they would.

        Peter Turchin’s observations on elite overproduction and the creation of counter-elites might be helpful. The elite live in a very competitive world.  If the official elite is incompetent, they are setting themselves up for replacement by the more competent.  Let’s make sure that some of those new elite are on our side.

            I think that you’re seeing a bit of that now. There’s a new crop of elites who either don’t get along with the current elites or realize that they’ll never be allowed in the inner Kosher circle.Musk is bristling at the controls being put on him. King Cobra doesn’t want to be a well-paid house slave to real rulers like Haley. JD Vance seems to be thinking along the lines of Cobra. (Note the Indian presence with both of them as Vance is married to a Brahmin.)As to whether any of this new crop of elites are on our side is questionable, but anything that disrupts the system is good for us.

                    Right… but Bill Ackman is fighting for Israel and his people against elements of the elite which have smoked too much of the woke stuff and gone anti-imperialist on Zionism. Only admirable thing about him is he bats his corner. Wish more of us could that for ours.
David Sacks seems to have Socrates’ terminal problem of following his Daimon wherever it takes him and calling it as he sees it — viz. he’s a more honest specimen.

            Turchin certainly shows the history of elite (and self-styled) elite competition. But I’m not sure his theory proves what the outcome of that competition will be. It could be argued that we already had the big intra-Elite competition and that the Woke dipsh*ts won.

        It’s hard to say what the “Left’s” goal is. They’ve successfully replaced white people in most facets of society. Unskilled labour – Hispanics. White collar – Indians, Chinese.The mentality from the Boomer leftists/centrists in power seems to be that they are great statesmen, high above all the racial politics, wonderful saviours, ushering in a new era of harmony and diversity. And their only priority seems to be to bring in as much diversity as possible.They are just morons and will be replaced soon by their own imports.The question is, what happens with the leftover white people. In their narrative, their ads, their universities, white people (especially white men), are the past. We are dinosaurs and we are going extinct. Racists, sexists, homophobes.Their problem, is that we are still here, and still doing things. That is 220 million + on the American continent alone. We are still producing children with a rate of about 1.6 per woman, higher than many ethnic groups. The worst white people (conservatives, Christians) are producing children at a higher rate than 1.6. So there will still be 130 million whites by 2100 at worst case.So what happens to us? I don’t really know. The regime has a massive problem of believing their own BS.

            It’s hard to say what the “Left’s” goal is.So what happens to us?It’s really quite easy to figure out what will happen, esp. when you think about the reproduction rate of “white” Christians and the progs’ neurosis about “racism”. The progs are ever afraid of setbacks and recidivism, and their own mentality will make them frightened that the diversity is unequal to the task of preventing recidivism to conditions of, say, the 19th century. The progs’ mortality, their secularism, and their awareness of their own low birth rates will make them frantic to lock in their gains while moving the ball closer to the goal for a winning kick. Given their mentality and habits, solutions are easy to foresee.Expect systemic WASPicide throughout the Anglosphere and western Europe. (Pretexts will be manufactured.) Expect also eradication of all the pope’s “white” shamans, wherever they live. Expect billions to turn a blind eye while your ilk is hunted as if just rabid rats. Eradication of “white” Christians is necessary anyway, and it wll be very popular.The projects in South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia will be greatly intensified. There will be death squads of brownskins in Europe to crush stupid nationalists. (I am being reduntant.) A doubling or tripling of replacement migration into all of these areas, esp. the USA and Canada, is a foregone conclusion beginning next year. There will be much moredancing in the streets.There will be a massive expansion of lawfare to persecute any and all prosperous or independent “white” people, not to mention lawfare against repollution schools like Bible colleges and seminaries.“white” people will be chased out of every college science department, every engineering department, every business school, and every law school.Firearms held privately, except by the diversity, will be seized. Within twenty years there will be no “white” cops or military officers in (((Western))) civ. Farms will be seized for redistrubution to replacements. European Americans will abandon the Democrats, and the GOP will become a faction for “white” progs.

Flip the question. What happens to those that are geriatric, do not breed, lie with their own sex … (see: do not breed.)
What happens when those they wish to usurp refuse to sacrifice their young to the gods of war? Refuse to go to movies? Vote? Refuse to eat out?

        I remember Reagan’s solution called “mainstreaming” which closed down the halfway houses which served to bridge the gap between prison and re-integration into society, sheltered workshops that kept idle retarded little hands busy, and mental institutions for those too addled to behave in a civilized manner, or to remember to take their psycho-meds on a daily basis, so now we have the leftovers and left-outs homeless on every street corner and loonies twirling from the lampposts and attacking the public. It might have cost more in taxes to do it the right way, and then we would also have a place where all the psychology majors and karens could exercise their efforts upon a grateful portion of society. And let’s no even mention the vast cash cow portion of society called registered sex offenders, which exempts a great swathe of qualified white males from ever having gainful employment again.t

            Problem is those things largely didn’t work. People didn’t want halfway houses in their neighborhoods because they were filled with recidivists. Despite the “best” efforts of group therapy, pharmaceuticals, and electroshock, shrinks contributed absolutely nothing to making people better — shrinks only work if the patients aren’t too screwed up to start with.
It’s not just that it would cost more taxes. It’s that it would cost more taxes with nothing to show for it.

            Reagan did not close down mental institutions—and probably most of what you state—as those are under the purview of the States.  What shut down the mental institutions was money hungry State legislatures and the promise of psychoactive drugs to “treat” mental illness outside of institutionalization.Mainstreaming was also not entirely a product of the Reagan administration.  This pernicious idea was pushed at State level by any number of progressives of the time.  It most affected the typical citizen through the local school system, where all sorts of “special needs” students were placed out of specialized education and into typical classrooms to the detriment of the students.  Court decisions of the time did not help matters either, and to this day exasperate the problem.  I suppose that may be laid at the hands of the Fed’s.The ADA was passed in 1990 which opened the floodgates was passed under Bush I.

                Mainstreaming was just something that pretty much everyone could agree on, even though it was not exactly Federal. That was back in the day when at least people could more or less admit that what they had wasn’t working.
I think Reagan can be fairly blamed for using Federal money to whip the states into adopting policies, starting with his withholding road tax from states who would not impose 21 drinking age, and continuing with the War on Drugs, the War on Education, and the War on Medical Care (EMTALA).

                I could never understand why we send retarded children to school.  It is pointless.  It’s a super expensive babysitting service.Keep in mind that it’s not like we send them to 3 years of elementary school to learn the most basic of basics like signing their name and other basic tasks.  Classrooms for them exist all the way to the end of jr high, at least when I was in school.  There might have been high school classes for them too, but that they were all bused to some central school for retarded children and so I just didn’t see them.It’s the same thing with “L.D.” as it was called when I was in public school in my district.  L.D. supposedly meant learning disabled. But what it really meant was troublemakers and dumb kids.The whole problem with the crazy people is the same problem with retarded children and the dumb people and troublemakers and that is that there is a magical “solution” to these problems.  Whether it’s medication or extra tutoring or anger management classes, there is always some lettered “experts” trying to monetize social problems while also maximizing the damage they cause.  They always use extremely disingenuous and emotional rhetoric to implement their evil programs.

                    Yep, wrt special needs children it seems to stem from the parents refusal to consider “little Johnny” as *different*.  However, school systems also were at fault for poor special needs education.  What we find now is the hiring of special teachers’ aids to handle “little Johnny” so he’s not too disruptive on his other classmates.
Disruption in the classroom is the number one problem in our public schools.  One that gets suppressed because it’s so closely tied to our minority population growth.  The Obama administration also threatened school systems for disciplining minorities in k-12.

        Reagan beating Carter triggered many Dems in the DC area, employed by the Feds in various Departments, Bureaus and Commissions, to decamp to the provinces. They saw the handwriting on the wall and brought their proggie views, before those were widely recognized, and infected field offices. I, along with many of your readers, saw variations on that theme.Thus an early element of what we now know as the Deep State offered its own contribution to that Long March Through The Institutions. Those DC refugees typically left relatively high-paying jobs (e.g., GS-14) to parachute into, say, GS-12 or -13 positions where they still had some clout and so could influence subsequent hiring and policy.Another example of institutions turning left. Fortunately for the country, many of those are aging out to their fat Fed retirement programs. Unfortunately, they have way too many stay-behinds to wreak havoc, derail, delay, obfuscate and obstruct.p.s., Reagan used a Real Rate of Return criterion in various policy areas to make proposed investments demonstrate that they weren’t just pissing away taxpayer money. That dovetailed nicely with Margaret Thatcher’s saying:Socialism works until you run out of other people’s money.

        “There were elements of the institutional left that opposed Reagan.”
Memories…Got me thinking as I am old enough to remember the election.  What were the knocks on Reagan as compared to today.
Reagan was a divorced man!  Reagan was a “movie actor”.  Reagan was too old.  Reagan was a know nothing, but good at the “part”.  Reagan falls asleep at cabinet meetings.  And so on.
All I can say is what a difference 40 years makes.  What were considered disqualifications then are nowde rigueurin politics.

        I’m very sympathetic to everyone in this thread poo-poohing the Fourth Turning cliches.That said, there won’t be any reform until there’s generational change and a major crisis. Max Planck’s dictum that “Science progresses one funeral at a time” certainly applies to politics too. All the gerontocrats running things aren’t going to crap their diapers and suddenly awaken to the fact they’ve screwed everything up and they need to step aside.It could be argued that Victorian England was the only system to generate meaningful internal reform without a crisis in the last 500 years. Pitt the Younger had all the basic ideas but it would take 40 more years to implement any of them.

        “Today the dollar is under pressure mostly due to Washington perfidy.”It acelerated an underlying process but that process of de-dollarisation existed in robust fashion before 2022. The US economy has been an ever smaller fraction of the global economy and in addition the debt overhang that has snowballed in order to maintain USA’s global military hegemony over the last two decades or more, and the inability to keep interest rates even at the rate of true inflation, has made holding US financial assets increasingly unattractive. This loss of reserve status — and the concomitant of the dollar being under pressure — will be a continuous rather than discrete process. For recent examples just looking at the various sterling crises Britain faced once it lost its imperial possessions after WW2.

            The “BRICS ratio.”
1 barrel of oil = 1 gram of gold.
The summary is, slipping a fake Fedbux IOU inbetween commodities – our famous “reserve currency” schtick – causes wild swings in the float, because the price is tethered to the IOU, not the availability of the commodity.
The BRICS are pegging commodity to commodity, with gold backing as an anchor.Very stable. Not subject to the unpredictable swings of the United States club.
When the crazy guy starts waving a gun around, people start heading for the exits, fast.  The BRICS just unlocked the exit door.

        There is a bunch of history that is applicable. Rwanda, 1994. Cambodia, 1975-79. Armenia, 1917. Some various combinations are our immediate future.It is looking like it will be lawfare, all the way down. Maxine Waters, wants trials for Trump donors, voters, and supporters. She is quite likely to get them. Meanwhile Hunter’s first trial is fixed with friends of Dr. Jill and ex addicts and ex Secret Service all on the jury. The Canadian Trucker donors had their bank accounts all seized. No reason the same will not happen to Trump donors and pretty much all YT people. “The AI says you supported Trump! Guilty!”The public morality of the corporate, ngo, legal, bureaucratic, and military class holds that YT is genetically evil, bears hereditary blood guilt, and must dealt with. This inevitably leads to the Hotel Rwanda and Killing Fields movies.  If you wanted like Lenin “the worse the better,” well you are getting it.Trump will not even survive the month of July at this rate after his 100 year plus sentence. No the Supremes are not going to hear anything. There is no Reagan or voting to save us.

            The Hunter trial coming immediately on the heels of the Trump trial tells me Hunter will be found guilty. Then the narrative will be “See? The rule of law is fair and impartial. Even the president’s son is not above it.” And then it’s open season for draconian punishment of Trump by this proven fair legal system. Followed immediately by the GOP nominating a different candidate, probably Bloody Nikki. If the fix is in for Hunter to be acquitted, then why bring him to trial at all? And why now? It’s not as if the media would say boo about it if charges were dropped.Yes I believe Joe would sacrifice his son for another 4 years. Assuming Hunter is actually incarcerated in a federal pen and not on some south seas island.If you’ve been reading my posts here I’ve been floating the idea of the big hebrews making an alliance with Trump and fixing it for him in November, but as new information comes in I update my outlook.

                One count of lying on a 4473? Five year max, most likely suspended. For much the same reason that Trump is arguing selective prosecution — they only prosecute around 30 (that’s 30, not 30 thousand) of the roughly 80 thousand 4473 violations every year, and almost all of those prosecutions are enhancements for another felony.

            I think the only winning play for Trump is to sell off all his NY assets as fast as possible, then give them the finger. Don’t go to sentencing. Go hold a massive rally in Texas or Florida on the 11th. What is NY going to do about it? Send their State Police to Texas and face the Rangers, or maybe the National Guard?
That kind of overreach would absolutely cement Trump’s election. And then come January, stop every block grant, all federal support for NY. People are sick and tired of the fuggin’ crybullies.

        The group that the current ruling elite idealizes actually does have a solution. Post WW2, the Allies oversaw massive population transfers all over the world. Germans disappeared from everywhere east of the Oder-Neisse. Muslims vanished from the subcontinent. Russians, white and red, vanished into gulags. Palestinians vanished from Israel.

                Putting aside the fact that Trump is a rather vulgar man, he is also a pretty plain spoken man.  I will take plain spoken vulgarity over the pretty lies of the ruling elite in both parties.Leftists like to pretend that we don’t see Trump’s flaws and are enamored by his BSing.  The fact that most of the “plain” people in America see him as a savior really says a lot about our leaders.  While Trump may be all the things they say, he doesn’t drone on about how wonderful “diversity” is while bombing the 3rd world.Though one can never really know what is in the heart of another man, I do get the feeling that regardless of his ability to help, he doesn’t hate 1/2 the country and would genuinely want to help the working class.He’s definitely a mixed bag, but still far better than anything else on offer from the elite.

Yep, I like the idea posed that Trump is a populist and that his support is really a populist uprising against the elites, not really against one party or another.  A sort of pox on both houses, burn the house down movement—although perhaps his rank and file don’t quite see themselves that way.  In this manner of thinking I have no problem supporting him and have said so in the past.  I can criticize and yet with good conscience vote for him.

            That is mostly anti-Trump agit-prop. Trump is as Yankee as you get, just the Queens variety rather than the Connecticut variety. His appeal may be greatest in the South, but that is true of the party as a whole. People also forget that Reagan was a tough populist in economic issue like trade. Trump’s China policy was a copy of Reagan’s Japan policy.Stylistically, Trump reflect the tastes of television, while Reagan reflected the tastes of the golden age of cinema, but politically there is not much of a difference. Both men had a natural feel for their audience that is rare, but necessary in a great salesman.

                I wasn’t alive when Reagan was president so take me with a grain of sand.
My gut instinct is that the successor ideology to reaganism is ted cruz Ron desantis style “true conservatism” which I’ve never much liked.
Trumps worldview is less dogmatic and more a smorgasbord of various stuff.

                    The thing to keep in mind about those two guys, and many like them (eg Rubio) is that they’re play acting.  The highest compliment they can get is to be called “Reaganesque” by Peggy Noonan (who was a Reagan speechwriter that milked Conservative Inc for decades).  They’re the people Zman is talking about when he refers to old men reciting lines from 50 years ago.Trump’s worldview represents a smashing of the post Civil War D vs R status quo.  On many issues he’s not much different than Bernie Sanders.  They agree on the problem, but not the solution.  On other issues he’s a lot like Reagan who Trump knew and met with.  On other issues like immigration, he’s far to the right of Reagan.A lot of the #resistance to Trump is people fighting to maintain the status quo from the 80’s and 90’s.  A two party system where they join forces and 80% of the country has no representation.

                    Reagan had a sense of humor and it wasn’t just an act. After getting shot, his joke about hoping his doctors were Republican demonstrated a human side the stuffed shirt robots like Ted Cruz or DeSantis just don’t have.

                Didn’t the trade deficit explode under Ronald Reagan?   I recall also that this was a time with peak anti-auto-worker sentiment with constant bellyaching about how much money these union workers were making.  It was a way of blaming blue color workers for the endless regulations driving up the cost of auto production.

                    Trade deficits are not that simple. It’s just inflationary fiscal and/or monetary policy with insufficient domestic production to sop up the excess cash sloshing around. Spending under Reagan doubled. But with high consumer sentiment, people were willing to spend this newfound “wealth”.
The complaints about unions were also more involved. Why buy an American lemon when you can buy a more or less defect-free Datsun for half the money? Thus, the quotas and tariffs on Japanese vehicles, like @Zman is referring to.

        Watched both conventions that year not quite 8yrs old. Remember the Dem convention especially because The Chappaquiddick Olympian was all over the place trying to snare the nomination out from under Jimmy Carter. My takeaway @ the tender age of 8yrs old: Democrats are insane &amp; Republicans @ least try to deal with reality.
Still the same today although I ditched the R party to be an independent; thank Shrub II &amp; his WMD lies/Dept of Homeland Security for that.

            Man, you’re a seriously hardcore political junkie. When I was 7 years old (1974), the Watergate trials were on TV in the afternoon and my mom watched them constantly. I just rolled my eyes, heaved sighs of disgusted boredom, and decamped to the great outdoors to play guns with my little buddies. I didn’t become remotely political until about the age of 16.

                In high school, I was napping on the couch.
I felt a great disturbance in the Force; waking up, I saw the tv was on, and watched Nixon announce his resignation,
Then, I fell back asleep, as if drained.

        How interesting, not done reading yet.I remember! The Reagan boom was when we reached working age.The 50’s and early 60’s boom was when we were being born and starting school.The whole country was building hospitals and starter homes, and making baby clothes, and selling baby shoes, and dentists and parks and schools, and roads and factories to supply all this, stuff for all these little kids. Kids underfoot everywhere.You see all those old skyscrapers in New York? Know what they were for?They weren’t offices and banks and such.They were filled with ladies at sewing machines, making all those baby’s and kid’s clothes.The first crack in the offshoring door was when JFK okayed 4% that garment industry to be made in Asia. Everybody there was union, the workers productivity went to their pockets and stayed in their communities, people had the dosh to go bowling on Friday night.

            I grew up in the late 50s-early 60s on a farm 9 miles from a town with about 1,800 people. A clothing manufacturer had factory there where a couple dozen farm wives could earn some extra income sewing baby clothing. The plant was unionized–ALGWU–but these were rural Midwesterners who worked hard and had no demands other than that their paychecks came on time.
Not long after Kennedy’s 4% ruling, the plant shut down. Not because of the union, as a libertarian would claim, but because nobody in America was going to work in a sweatshop for 10 cents an hour.

            People could still have the dosh to go bowling. They just choose to have 2+ cell phones, Netflix, internet, fast food, air conditioning, a car for every adult,etc. People have chosen a lifestyle of golden handcuffs.
I’m not saying they are making the wrong choice; it’s none of my business what they choose. Just emphasizing that it is a choice.

        “Demographically, America is like the filmWorld War Zwhere the new vibrancy isscalingthe walls. No one knows what to do about it, other than build the walls higher.”
Wrong and even more wrong. There was no wall to begin with, neither literally nor metaphorically, and the zombies already breached the lines long ago. As far as not knowing what to do about it, well, shucks, Z, it’s not knowing but notwantingto do anything about.
