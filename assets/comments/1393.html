        I think projection is all you need to highlight. The idea that the left even understands the damage it does implies a self-awareness that simply isn’t there. Death cult is an idea that can be expanded a lot but the left simply won’t see it.Le Pen is no fascist unless you buy the leftist lie that if you want to save France for whites you want a French Gestapo and to have a command economy with private business under your thumb. Preferring your own people and nation is hardly leftist, which is to say fascist or communist.Far right is about contracts, tradition, law, consent, and cultural integrity. Resorting to force to protect these things is acceptable but it hardly places one idiosyncratically on the left where coercion is the order of the day.Finally, Le Pen is socialist in her economics and as constrained by the French electorate’s slavish desire for every last parasitic public benefit as the next politician.

        Their faulty education has left them deracinated: they know not what they do.
