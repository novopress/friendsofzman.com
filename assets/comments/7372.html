        The London Times called Powell’s speech evil. His conservative party colleagues turned on him. That was in 1968. Today England is in hospice, dying of immigration cancer. It is being kept sedated by massive injections of PC morphine from the whacky BBC and the government. It will take a while to die, but it will surely die.

            Germany and France are in a desperate hurry to follow England down the drain.

                Your choice of the word desperate is really interesting. These countries injected themselves with immigration cancer in the first place. The phrase tired unto death comes to mind. Western Europe, under America’s military umbrella since the late forties, has been the epitome of self-indulgence. Exhausted now, they’ve  stopped having children, they’ve stopped working, have nothing to live for and are desperate to hasten the end, which wasn’t coming quickly enough. Hence the injection.

        My paternal Grandfather (born in Bath) immigrated from London to the city of my birth, Los Angeles, sometime around 1910. My mother’s ancestors were Scots (Ferguson). I have always longed to go to England to personally trace my roots.I have, from afar, watched in abject horror to what England has become. I now know I will never go there. I will die without this dream being fulfilled.The “Long March” of the Frankfort School and the Communists to take over the West has been completed in all of Western Europe and there is no solution but submission or a very bloody war (which I still think will ne instigated by Germany. There is already and EU army forming up with over 2 million servicemen from Deutschland and the Netherlands heavily involved). Islam is being used as a tool (really, a blitzkrieg) by the EU and globalist elites to force submission of the emasculated white men of Europe.Brexit is as good as dead, if not by vote then my demography.We here in America are next in line. Only us, aligned with the Eastern European states (and also OZ who have oceans and real men still as protection) have a chance.We MUST elect Trump and keep The Lizard Queen as far away from power as possible.  If we do not, we are history as a nation.Heed the words of Mr. Powell.Thank you, Z, for posting his entire speech. I know too few here even know of it. This needs to be shared far and wide.

            I think if you did come here you would be pleasantly surprised.Outside of London and a few big cities life goes on much as before. Don’t write us off just yet as there is more to England than the rantings of a motley bunch of socialists and Islamic nutters.

                    no, they come off the reservation to where the majority live and they suffer as they do everyday,I live here and fear of their capabilities never crosses my mind.when at my home in America though I am far more alarmed  at the destruction of such a great society by your leftie pols only in Utah visiting relatives do I see the America I grew to love when first visiting long ago.At least in England we have a conservative govt under pressure from the right and we will have for at least another decade…you will have Hillary! I know where I feel safer.

                            What do we Americans really know about England?  We see BBC programs and outrageous stuff like the new greaseball mayor of Metropolitan London.   I know that the English are an inscrutable people.  Thud doesn’t strike me as a fellow who lives in a fantasy world, so I will tend to believe he knows far more of what is going on in his own country than I ever will.   The English have been through periods of nearly complete social collapse before, and they have pulled through.

                                I want to believe you but Ive talked to Englishmen who told me there were no Islamic “no-go” areas in the entire country.  Either they were wrong or I was. I encounter many upper middle class Britons who think similarly, love Obama, and hate Trump.  The upper middle class in the Anglosphere is hopelessly deluded, perhaps because things are going well for it even if they won’t for the next generation.  I was on Simon Shepherd’s blog today and he states that things in the UK are as bad as I believe them to be.Either way, allowing the Mohammedans to control port cities through which the country is supplied is very bad.

        It’s fascinating that Powell used the United States as a cautionary example. Our inability to properly assimilate our 10% black population seems like a quaint problem now compared to what Europe faces. Of course, our problems have only gotten worse since 1968 with the invasion of thirty million Hispanics. But as bad as our problems look– and they look bad– Muslims are a death sentence for every society they have ever infiltrated. A track record of almost 100% success. Only the Spanish have managed to evict the Muslims, and that took them centuries of effort, and of course, “rivers of blood.”

        I have a distant female relation, by marriage, who lives in London and was born Jewish. She does not particularly follow her family religion but there is no doubt of her heritage. She is, like many thirty-something citizens of London, both well paid and a socialist: her hatred for the ‘evil’ Tories knows no bounds. So much so that she voted, oddly, for the Muslim Lord Mayor who was put forward by Labour (and in so doing ignored the Jewish man who was standing under the Tory banner.)I am told this is what democracy is, but I do wonder if the day may come when she begins to realise that the forthcoming small incremental changes to her city, slyly driven by Muslim ideology, will make her regret what her and her social justice warrior friends have done in the name of virtue signalling. Or perhaps, having money, she will find an excuse to leave it all behind.She may even realise two things as she departs: first, Jews like her may vote for Muslims but no Muslim will vote for a Jew, and secondly, the political party she holds so dear will never ever have anything but a muslim candidate for office in London, given he huge success of Sadiq Khan. That Labour here is pro-Muslim and anti-working man  — traditionally the core of the party — is slowly becoming clearer by the day, and that may dawn on her too.I hate to say this, but I do wonder if the word ‘betrayal’ may finally come to mean something to her.

            The answer is no. Nearly half of Lenin’s cadre of Bolsheviks were Jews. When the revolution was finally secured, Stalin began calling the Bolshevik Jews in for execution. Stalin was no fool, he saw them as his greatest threat. They submitted knowingly, for the good of the revolution. Eisenhower gave the  Rosenbergs  the opportunity for life, but they kept silent and sacrificed the mental health of their children. A million Jews and hangers on demonstrated in NYC for the Rosenbergs.

        London has fallen. And I can’t believe that the same people who endured and sacrificed so much during WWII, let London fall without a shot, or even a whimper. This is not some tiny bodunk town nobody but the locals care about, but the capital of England. Yes, that England! I feel like I should be in mourning for them, but it seems like they don’t care enough to save their culture from the Moslem onslaught. The Moslem world is chortling with glee at the latest feather in their barbarian caps. Maybe this will be a wake-up call to the Brits. Not only are the barbarians at the Gate, they’ve already taken over the place. All without a shot or a raised sword.By chance, I read Enoch Powell’s Rivers of Blood speech a couple of months ago. I can’t believe how prescient, or how his words fell on so many deaf ears.

        The dirt people are the only ones through history who have ever changed the world for good. Gonna be a lot of gates of Vienna before this is over. It will come down to a tireless minority of indomitable spirits, a tiny plurality of determined people who will end up sacrificing everything for the West who will again defeat tyranny. That is humanities self extinction trait, that the pendulum has swung full retard again towards self destruction again, and it is without fail the psychopathic fucktards who run the nation states who without fail have done everything possible to enable this tribulation. It is going to really hurt this time, for that absence of statesmanship, and the first principles and reason employed that created the Christian Judea West to begin with has been the door that opened the West to the infidel perversions and islamist horde.Yumaris aljin mae allah.

        THE ISSUE of our time.  Everything else going on in the world is minor.  Yet many people in the West refuse to even acknowledge the problem, much less recognize the scope and consequences.

        The silver lining in this is if the Euros give their countries away to the Muslims we can’t justify spending blood and treasure giving them back like we did twice in the last century. I’m good with that. And we might if we play our cards right we might get some doctors and engineers out of the deal. Like we did in the 30’s.
