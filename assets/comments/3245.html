        The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on.
Sorry Omar K, today it is more that the moving finger having writ on the OpEd page hangs round and writs it over again and then examines the online comments to see if it is in line with correct thinking and whether the rest of the Eloi approve and will thus invite the finger to their next little soiree.

        The word journalist has lost all meaning.  Emil is not trying to intimidate F. Chuck Todd here; he’s threatening trust fund hipsters with attitudes and blogs.I find it hysterical that all these ubermenschen who have flouted and belittled bourgeois values since infancy are now in a twittering panic because someone might reveal their louche sexual habits or tedious drug use.  People who think it acceptable to use nude selfies for passport photos are now worried that strangers may see their junk.  Is it possible that the Eloi and the Morlocks have bred, producing this weird race of bestial effeminati?  It’s like the drag queens have inherited the earth.
