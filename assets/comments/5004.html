        Wouldn’t Cosby make for a great Democratic presidential candidate given his philandering track record? After having declared, Hilary should immediately withdraw from the race, saying she’ll devote all her energies to supporting him, and bake him some cookies.

        The thing is, Cosby didn’t have to drug any of these young women to have sex with him, so why did he? If wealth and power are these fantastic sexual elixirs, then why didn’t Cosby just go with that? He even had the added bonus of celebrity. People are willing to forgive a lot from their cultural icons, but drugging women to have sex with them is probably not one of those forgivable things. It’s a shame he chose the criminal route as a means to his end, because he was one of the few well-known and respected black men who for years has spoken up about the destruction of the black family and cooesponding debasement of their culture.

            Apparently he straddled the fence.  He counted on and was covered by his fame and his “blackness” for years to do as he wished with a string of young women.  He gained fame and respect for honestly speaking about the real problems with the Black family and it’s urban culture.These two pursues were at odds.  Now Bill understands that.  If he had known this a decade ago he would have kept mum on the latter.  Then he would not be having these problems now.

        Government these days at any level will always do the easy things first. it is easier to pay an ‘executive’ to send emails about things to other ‘executives’ rather than hire someone to replace worn out roads. Emails are cheap, concrete and cement expensive.In the UK most of the sewers were built in Victorian times. They are, in their own way, marvels of civil engineering. But they won’t last forever. As they decay and no one can be bothered to do anything about it, only the emergence of human waste on the streets might bring all sorts of issues (and diseases) out into the open.Someone once said that we couldn’t build pyramid now, which may or may not be true. But we certainly can’t repair the roads that our forefathers laid down and haven’t the will to make the sewers hold up.

        Rail projects, be they high speed or light rail, or whatever are vanity projects for Progressives. They are very much like stadiums- “…see? we’re a big city- we have light rail. You can take high speed rail from here to ‘wherever’…” I’m not a fan of public funding for stadiums, but at least pro sports (not necessarily the stadium projects themselves, mind you) are popular. Light and high speed rail are popular among the progs and the SJWs, but ordinary chuckleheads (and suburbanites, which to the progs are the same things, mostly) like their cars. That’s why the power of the state is being used to get people out of their cars. State governments and bureaucratic agencies like the Metro Council in Minnesota  are being used to make war on the ‘burbs.

        It’s not scarcity that’s preventing the repair of infrastructure.  It’s more like a man taking his paycheck and spending it on booze instead of food.  The money’s there, the food is there, but intercepting them is the pleasure to be gotten from alcohol, and that’s where the “resources” are going.  We’re a people that can’t deny ourselves our pleasures, so the money is spent on fun and games, leaving nothing for those boring, prosaic infrastructure projects.My city, in eastern Ontario, is typical.  We live in a cold, snowy climate.  It snows every year, sometimes a lot.  Everybody knows this.  Yet every year, it’s reported in January that the city’s snow removal budget is already exhausted.  There’s no money for snow removal!  Something that’s thoroughly predictable, and without which the city will simply not function.  Yet all summer long, we’re treated to Bluesfest, Jazzfest, Gayfest, You-name-it-Fest, all of which are funded by the city.  Who can be bothered worrying about snowplows when there’s fun and entertainment to be had?

        I notice you mention scarcity as not being an issue anymore on a fairly regular basis. Whenever I read that I am reminded of the freeway bridge that collapsed in Minnesota. The bridge collapsed, not as a freak accident, but because the gov’t decided that there weren’t enough resources to repair it before it collapsed. I believe most rational people would believe that is cya bureaucratic bs. Yet as one looks around at our society, infrastructure put in place by previous generations is slowly collapsing. New York is building a new underground aqueduct to replace ones built 100+ years ago that are in danger of collapse, but with budget “cutbacks” (meaning not increasing as much as “needed”) it seems doubtful it will be completed in time. Los Angeles has lengthened the time between repaving streets to close to one hundred years, does anyone really think that is workable? I look at Detroit and just want to cry, the work of generations has been allowed to collapse because …  New York may well know a scarcity of water, L.A. a scarcity of transportation, Detroit knows a scarcity of everything. You may say this is all “man made” and you would be correct, but isn’t that true of most scarcities? Rome collapsed, not because of a scarcity of resources, but because of their misallocation, much as we are doing. past generations built for the future, but it seems that as the gov’t gets larger the need to consume grows to the point where investing (truly investing, not spending called investing) is pushed off of the table. Governor Moonbeam (Brown) stopped the last freeway project in L.A. and declared freeways unneeded and a waste, now he wants to build high speed rail between Bakersfield and Fresno so Senator Feinstein’s husband can make another $billion. So we can’t pave the streets, but we can spend a few billion on a train between two dead cities that nobody will ride. there is still scarcity, not just of resources, but of accountability.
