        “There’s nothing that screams smug pussy more than slapping a question mark onto a statement…”SURE there is. Upturned inflection at the end of EVERY assumptive sentence as IF it were a question. Granted, that’s an in person, aural thing.Shakespeare: Shylock was…um…bad…or something, right?What does that make the International Trade Bank?

            All the uptalk is grating. On-line, the passive-aggressive use of questions makes me want to punch the person in the face.

        Like Western Europe, we’ve come to the point where our regulations and taxes are making manufacturing nearly impossible.  I’m opposed to this deal, but as I see it the purpose is a quid pro quo for the corporations – you don’t fight continued outlawing of production of a wide variety of goods, we let you bring in the same things made elsewhere.I’d admire the Democrats for fighting it, but they just want more union concessions before they sign off – nobody is bringing up the free flow of immigrants from signatories part of the deal, a precedent that if it slips by without the media bringing it up, will be a standard clause for every deal moving forward.

        Unfettered free trade is like open borders: “the free flow of people, goods, money, ideas, trade, etc.,” sounds good on paper, not so much in real life. When the globalists are for something, then you know it’s gotta be bad for the average working American. And if it gives the Executive more power, then that’s a non-starter. If Obama wants it, then you know it’s extra extra bad for the country.

            Yeah, anything that allows obama to have negotiating powers with any nation is going to leave us, the USA, totally screwed. Obama simply has no negotiating skills at all. He’s either total stonewalling or total capitulation. Like many bullies, he folds when confronted with strong opposition.

                Yes, O’Butthead may be a bad negotiator, but never forget, he’s also playing for the other team. Just because he’s wearing the USA jersey, means nothing to this traitorous bastard. May the fleas of a thousand camels infest his armpits.
