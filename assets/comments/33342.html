        I always look forward to your prediction posts, Zman.  It inspired me last year to do one of my own, and this year was my second round:https://neofeudalreview.substack.com/p/2024-predictions-review-and-2025Basically I am decidedly pessimistic.  The institutional voting fraud that was instituted during the false-emergency of COVID, i.e. nationwide vote-by-mail overseen by a Democrat tsar at the Post Office, put there by Marc Elias, combined with continued electronic Dominion voting machine fraud, ubiquitous ballot harvesting fraud, and outright ballot stuffing (none of which previously has been punished), means that elections now and moving forward are not merely controlled or managed by the elites but *decided* by the elites.Under this perspective, for Trump to win can only mean one thing: then he caved to the elites behind closed doors.   To be allowed to win the election, he must betray his base and give the elites everything they want after he wins. This means total support for Israel (including West Bank and Golan annex recognition), this means open borders from India, this means limited to no deportations of illegals, this means no criminal charges for Fauci or anyone else associated with COVID or the Obama-era Spygate coup attempt, this means total capitulation to the Musk/Thiel surveillance state, this means war with Iran, this means whatever the elites want in Ukraine, this means unlimited graft continues to the elites, this means so much more.Ugly stuff is ahead.

        Mass immigration is like an evil hydra that refuses to die. Every time you think it’s on the ropes, a new head pops up, vicious and determined as ever.This time, all the “conservatives” are demanding infinity Indians. Why? Well, after people rightfully ridiculed the idea that all Indians are super computer geniuses, it went back to standard talking points – whites are bad and we deserve to be replaced. Same as the leftists.Why do so many people have this psychological response to idolize and promote foreigners? There’s a huge desire among a huge portion of our populations to bring these people in and erase our nations.Anyways, the answer is NO. To everything. Indians are not super geniuses. They will scam, scam, and scam. They will scam things that it never even occured to you as a thing that could be scammed.They will bleed the system dry until every emergency room is clogged up by 3 generations of Indians treating a trip to the hospital over a runny nose as a family outing. And other constant bizarre and foreign behaviors.As a Canadian with first hand experience, you can’t push back hard enough. Keeping Indians out of the USA is literally an existential crisis for your nation.

            I have a feeling that we might have a shot at limiting Indian immigration in the US and immigration in general. I definitely could be wrong, but I suspect that Jews are changing their mind on immigration, especially Indian immigration, as something “good for the Jews.”
We may find ourselves in alliance with our old foe on this issue going forward. We’ll see.

                There may be a Jewish/Indian alliance for a while but it will be the mother of all falling outs at some point. Based on what we saw over Christmas that may be sooner rather than later.

                    That’s my point. Jews might be finally waking up to the fact that allowing in a smart, aggressive, ethnocentric group isn’t a great idea. They had the playing field all to themselves. Now, there’s competition. Dumb.

                    Yeah, at some point, the Ashkenazi Jew will notice that Europe is becoming a hostile place for them. Israel is getting taken over by the Orthodox. Asia won’t let them in.
What’s the leave: the US. Might not want to fill your last refuge with low-IQ browns that dislike you (Hispanics) and high-IQ browns who act like you (Indians).

                        “Israel is getting taken over by the Orthodox.” The secular-orthodox division is interesting to watch because it mirrors the liberal-conservative division in whites.
Divisions like this are where ethnocentrism is crucial. From what I observe, the chosen do not let this division prevent them from presenting a united front to other groups, while the liberal-conservative division in whites yields outright hatred, which precludes cooperation.
Will the secular-orthodox gap remain bridgeable? Will the less successful white liberals, harmed by DEI and mass immigration and disgusted by tr@nnies, find common cause with conservatives?

                            The Ashkenazi would never betray in the Orthodox, but that doesn’t mean that they want to live in Israel dominated by them. If that ever happened, the Ashkenazi would be happier living in New Jersey or California, so best to make sure America isn’t too full of Central Americans and Indians.

            Mass migration and national and white erasure are the whole ball of wax. It may not be possible to achieve but those who want these evil things are trying their best to attain them. I appreciate your Canadian perspective on Indians. It comports with my gut about the Subcons but the confirmation is welcome. Watching King Cobra flame out here and vicariously torch Vance in the process makes me think we may be able to avoid the same fate. The H1B visa exploding prior to Trump’s inauguration was beautiful watch. After all, Trump bases his policies on who was the last person in the room and what is in popular media. Vance now may whisper in Trump’s ear something counter to what he would have prior to Christmas.

                I don’t understand Musk at all. Doesn’t he come from a place where whites were marginalized? You would think that a lesson would have been learned by actually having to live in South Africa.

                        Yes, he does seem unstable.  I remember his ridiculous outbursts when the cave rescuers in Thailand didn’t want his help.  Musk called the Brit leading the effort a “pedo” on Twitter.   Bannon called Musk a toddler over the weekend.

                    Don’t know the inner workings of SA, but I suspect diversity there, like diversity here, does not hit all levels of the socio-economic strata equally.  True, in SA it might have affected even the upper echelon Whites, but they likely had better means to avoid/escape than the lower levels.

                        From what I gather, and if anyone knows contrary please correct me, only recently has the wages of blackness started to hit a previously insular South African upper class. Musk left before the diversity damage hit those otherwise isolated from it. As pointed out earlier, he may be unstable as well.

                            There’s also an overclass of Indians in SA too. I just assumed that Elon doesn’t think about blacks that much, just as I don’t think of Native Americans that much. Compared to blacks, Indians probably seem rather normal and civilized to him. Probably most anywhere in Africa benefits from non-African immigrants.

                    That s-show with Musk and Ramaswamy is fascinating to watch.  But it’s  mainly about their friends.  The H1B crowd is their circle of friends.  It’s how they got here and how they built their empires.They both stepped in it royally and will now have to figure out a way to reingratiate themselves with the 97% of Americans who understand we don’t need Indians here at all.  Most of those H1B Indians are displacing white DEMOCRAT core constituency voters in places like CA, WA, FL and elsewhere.  H1B rage is not just a MAGA thing, and white males getting passed over for jobs for cheaper Indians crosses every political party demographic.They quickly found out that a great way to get everyone to hate you is to demand more Indians in America.

                    Lacking even the instinct for survival, humans will almost invariably fall back upon old habits and superstitions to get through life. In a heathy society, that may be enough. In a sick one, it can lead to perdition. In other words, Musk carries within his subconscious the Afrikaner habit of welcoming infinite nonwhites into histuisland.* Only through very conscious effort can this tendency be resisted, such as in little Orania.*The Highveld settled bythe Boerswas uninhabited and uninhabitable—except by those who possessed the technology to drill boreholes and dig catchments. The first blacks to pitch up on their farmsteads were survivors of the Zulu expansion. Later, they built hospitals for the many migrants who followed, reducing infant mortality from 80 percent to 20. They profited from the labor, but ended up losing their self-determination.

                    A lot of Musk’s problem is the same as the problem of any person who is rich enough. He seesgrowthas essential. He probably primarily thinks of this as economic growth, but he also must know that historically, economic growth rode on the back of population growth. Without a growing population you don’t see growing markets, labor pools, real estate investment opportunities, etc… This is at leastpartof the ruling class affinity for immigration given that everyone is now quite well aware that the native born are not even replacing themselves.Now, of course, not all the pro-immigration thinking is due to a desire to keep the population up. Some of it is certainly due to hatred of the legacy White population on the part of (((certain))) groups who are now joined in their animosity by self-loathing White libshits.There is some validity to the concern about a stagnant or even declining population of course. You can look at Japan and see that it puts a lot of stress on society in the form of demographic shifts toward older ages.Of course, the reallong termsolution in a healthy society must be a return to normal birth rates. This will require a massive moral and cultural restructuring, primarily the destruction of feminism, but also a general movement away from immediate gratification and hedonism.  It’s no surprise that many wealth people, being largely insulated from the negative effects of immigration that we are exposed to, simply go with clicking the big red button for infinity migrants from wherever you can get them.

                Years ago I read a book called Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells by an Indian author, who converted to Christianity, which laments the loss to world of the White race. Here is a excerpt:“Old Bill ruminates about the funeral of a police dog, and slides into a sweet dream. He has the forest mind of the European, treasuring the mystery of the dense forest, the charm of free-roaming animals, green plains stretching to horizon hills, and the cool spacious lands of the West. He and Philip contemplate about like matters: birdwatching, crossword puzzles, book clubs and murder mystery evenings — nuggets in the Caucasian way of life. Shahedul Islam laments that if white people disappear, he will no longer see men and women creating true science fiction, walking in fantasy costumes to a fancy dress party, and reveling in Dracula and Frankenstein. Fun, fantasy, imagination and Nature love. They form a question: Why is that in the eyes of the media, the social regime and the ‘liberals,’ the white race alone is guilty, worthless, dispensable, soon to vanish gently into that good night in “the new demographic”? Innocent thoughts?”Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells (When Giants Break the Spell): Raymond, Frank: 9781544060446: Amazon.com: BooksA link to an interview the author did on Red Ice Radio in 2016https://youtu.be/lZ4UVddLZCA?si=1YZWWf3DslED12tt&amp;t=2

            I’m not a fan of the subcoons. God knows there’s already too many of them over here. And in their own weaselly ways, they do plenty of damage. But as offputting and harmful as they may be, they’re unlikely to rape and murder, turn your neighborhood into an unliveable cesspool, singlehandly demolish a beautiful culture and turn it into a tarn of primitive idiocy and filth.
You want to send the pakoras packing? Fine, fine. I’m with you. But there are others I’d like to get shut of first.

                Well, in the old country, they’re really big on rape and murder. Their entire country, not just neighborhoods, is an unimaginable scene of filth and squalor that beggars belief. Bringing them here ensures that eventually they will do the same to what’s left of our beautiful country and culture.
There can be no ‘first’ – how about ALL?

                My cousin David in Toronto would take exception to that. He recently sent me a link where a mob of about fifty pajeets were going through a nice suburban neighborhood shouting at the locals, trying to feel up the women who were outside and one of them had a bullhorn and was yelling, “This is our country now! If you are English, go back to England. If you are French, it is time to return to France! Your government let us in and now this country is ours!”i understand you’ve got an axe to grind with a number of other groups, but these people are much more cunning and well financed.

            The magic juju words about America being a “melting pot” are very powerful.Be of good cheer, though.  Those days are rapidly ending.  I predicted last year that cries of “racism” would be met by jeers and be rejected by whites, and that day is now upon us as Elon and Vivek learned brutally on X last week.  Indians are a weird subculture and I think we’re going to see some sort of labor tariff emerge that says, “OK, you claim this is about acquiring essential skills.  If that’s the case, then you must be willing to pay more to get it…not less.”If Vivek were being truthful (him and Elon keep using sports analogies), they’d admit that low availability, high demand, skills pay incredibly well.  Just ask the Mets re: Juan Soto.  People saw right through their b.s. so now Elon is throttling negative feedback on Twitter which is what he claims he opposes.It’s a great time to be alive.My daughter goes to college in Canada.  On the sister campus to her college, it’s like visiting some weird hybrid of Jakarta, Tehran, and Bejing.  I can’t believe Canadians haven’t rioted yet, but maybe that’s why Canada is now saying they’re going to start cracking down on student visa abuse.  (They already have…student visas in the provinces were cut something like 30% last year.)If mass deportations are successful, the H1B people don’t stand a chance.

            Where I live (Middle TN south of Nashville, one of the fastest growing areas in nation) the Hindus are either surgeons or they operate the liquor stores! Often sharing the same family name, if you get my drift. They can be pushy social climbers, more than the Chinese, and I ascribe that to their former position in the British Empire, learning English with only a slight accent, which the Chinese are not that good at. Indians will also avoid areas with “bad” school districts for their offspring and enroll their kids in private, even religious (Christian) schools, to avoid contamination with lesser beings.

        Can someone explain to me how Ramaswamy is a billionaire?  From some accounts, he bought alzheimer failed drug for pennies, rebranded and went public and sold for 2 billion before it failed and crashed again.  Is that correct?   If it’s anywhere near correct, then this country is shit.  It’s an affront to every honest hardworking person that some shyster fast-talking  39 year old indian can be a billionaire like this.  Without creating any value, he is worth more than all of us combined and them some!  Does that seem right?Further, the mask has come off Musk, Ramaswamy, and Trump.  They want us buried by LEGAL immigration.  Fuck them!

            “Big pharma” sells the rights to its failed drugs in order to facilitate the financial uplift of certain connected persons via scams against innocent “investors” (or simple laundering). Fake drug is sold to insider or chosen future insider. He founds a startup based on it and falsifies its value in such a way as to allow suckers (but usually Peter Thiel) to give him a pile of money. He absconds into prominence. As a successful business titan, he funds antifa and/or conservatives worship him.

        “Trump, who has proven to be a world historical figure. “Really? From where I sit, Trump hasn’t done anything significant and positive – nothing to stop or reverse adverse trends – either at home or abroad. Just words, generating more words…The most that can objectively be claimed is that Trump’s first term may not have been as bad as the alternative.This second term was clearly allowed by the powers-that-should-not-be; and therefore, there is no realistic cause for optimism among those who desire peace, prosperity, decency – or that kind of stuff.And as for the transcendental values of truth, beauty and virtue – nobody’s even talking about doing anything positive in That direction.There is only one dead cert for a world historical figure in recent world politics (someone who objectively turned-around and massively re-built a major nation after a decade of accelerating terminal decline); and he is the arch enemy of the US Establishment.

            If 2nd term Trump falls for the “skilled immigrant from India” scam and opens the floodgates. I will make a bold prediction and say that yes, his presidency is a worse one than Kamala’s infinity Guatemalans.
Hopefully saner minds prevail in his cabinet. He really has the chance to be a truly Great man of history- IF he seals the border to aliens illegal and legal.

                The rot within AINO is so morbid and profound that it cannot be excized without completely rebuilding the country. And to rebuild, one must first raze. Anybody willing and able to do this would indeed be a world-historical figure. I have some sympathy for Trump, but I deeply doubt he has the stomach to do what is necessary.

                ‘Trump is the most consequential politician the world has seen in 100 years.’
What has Trump actually done?  The only thing your points show is that the ruling class was illogically consumed with hatred for him. These are not accomplishments. The most you can say is that he’s delayed their plans.  Now, he’s seemingly on board with said plans.
There are literally countless other politicians far more consequential during this period.  Here are just a few of the most obvious:

Ive said it before and I’ll say it again: they would preserve the status quo (that elections aren’t rigged) even if that meant letting Trump win.  They also know Harris is “stupid dangerous”.  Stupid harmless, smart harmless, and smart dangerous they can work with.  Stupid dangerous gets them killed along with the rest of us.

        Dissidents are prone to pessimism because for the last two decades, it has been the safe way to bet. Trump’s win IS a good thing…but Trump is only the stepping stone to what is coming. White people are the smartest and most resourceful people…once they’re motivated. And unified.

        “This is an example of something no one could see coming”Except some of us did. I predicted none of his trials would really result in anything substantial, that they were, essentially PR to keep in the news. Like much of what we see today, it was simply propaganda. The only reason to keep him in the news, including the fake alt-media, was to bring him back.I predicted 2 years ago they’d give him a comeback story, including some sort of major event to redeem him in light of his supporters feeling betrayed by J6.If you recall right, you also told me I was wacko for thinking Thiel still held any sway.Here we are.Wait until you find out they’re purposely trying to get you upset about immigration so they can weaponize it to unleash the “smart wall” on US citizens. Remember, folks, the wall isn’t to keep them out (they’ll keep letting them), it’s to keep you in.

            There are a handful of people like you who understood what was happening several years ago, and you’ve been proven absolutely correct. Two weeks ago Trump was shown on the Jumbotron at the Army-Navy Game with an ad for Palantir right next to his face — and people still ignore it. What can you do?People want to believe it can be turned around.They will never give up this hope until they’re eating ash. I enter 2025 with total resignation.Trump had the entire US government apparently ready to put him in prison for hundreds of years just 18 months ago. No single person can withstand an entire government’s desire to jail you. He did. Not only that, he became president. They want “the people” to believe they’re responsible for saving him. It’s one hell of a script.

LOL the scamps.  They do love their signaling!  It makes them feel superior.
Palantir certainly is a major NWO intel gamepiece.  All surveillance, all the time.
Donald has some serious dark family mojo in his past, all the way back to Bavaria.  Let us not forget Operation Warp Speed and two weeks to flatten the curve.

                Brother, that’s what they want too though. Either whipped up into a polarized frenzy or total resignation. The first provides a thin “democratic” political legitimacy to what has clearly become akin to a fascist oligarchy. That’s for the dumb asses you mentioned that ignore even that billboard you mentioned. They’re all gullible as fuck, including larping “dissidents;” both sides love fighting with each other for scraps or putting on the show or profiting directly from it.However, the second means the elite get a blank check to do as they like anyway. If anything, they want intelligent, good, politically-minded men jaded and funneled into this second option most of all. YOU are the one who will read history. YOU are the one who will ask questions. YOU are the one who might think, things could be different. YOU are the one who will say, to hell with it, and run for local office.This will be a very controversial opinion here…The solution is to re-build our truly democratic institutions, one brick at time. It’s a long, hard work with likely no acknowledgement let alone praise. If you look at the history of our country, it did, in fact, exist. Not everywhere at every moment. But it existed. Really, there is no grand end where we’re all saved by the cult leader, and we win. The work is renewed every generation, as some exchange freedom for security, without concern for their legacy, and others toil away at trying to be good men, because the best time to plant an oak tree might have been decades ago, but the second best time, is right fucking now.No one wants to hear that though. Instead, I have to be content to screed this  out under the silly name “Son” and be happy with the few upvotes I get here. 😛

        Mr. Wolf summed up my view of the coming fight.
Well, let’s not start sucking each other’s dicks quite yet.
Our mortal enemies are merely regrouping for the next push. As my coaches always said, you’re either getting better or getting worse. My bet is the GOP will fink the mid-terms to hang Trump out to dry like they did last time.
We need to see this struggle with our alien rulers as the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end.

Look how he and the Muskrat already started dancing away from immigration hardlines, and wanna escort in a horde of Injuns.  (They’re all injuns to me, dot or feather.)These people are billionaires.  They can’t understand our world, they have not experienced our world, it’s on teevee and not fully real to them.  Suffering is what makes it real and bigbux is a cushion.This world is a battlefield, full of predators.  You can find some soft and tender moments and love exists, sure, but don’t confuse that with reality.  Right now it’s the Wild West on earth and in heaven.

        I suspect the biggest and most important issue for us, White men and White women who properly crave the White patriarchy, was a big win in 2024. For several years I think many were walking around in a daze. The reckoning that the moral and financial undergirding of The Regime and its system was anti-White hatred and desire for total dispossession had a second wave that was a tidalwave in 2020. For me, 2012 – 2019 were realizations that, “they”, were anti-White and the entire legal and moral framework was anti-White and anti-West. It took 2020 to realize that they was the GAE, not random outsider crazies. It took Jared Taylor’s accurate and sane explanation of biological reality – that multi-ethnic/multi-racial societies are defined strife and conflict because it is underpinned by the biological reality of sameness and difference playing out in tribal rivalry.2024 was significant. It was the year that several years of trying to find IRL people to start building things with finally yielded results. Of course, you can’t just find any IRL people. They have to be normal, healthy and well adjusted such that their healthy spiritedness expresses itself in constructive words and actions.2024 was very fruitful in that regard. I hope that everyone here had a similar experience this past year. All around us the consequences of decades of betrayal, racial treason and utter madness in worshiping GDP continue to manifest. 2025 will continue to reap those terrible fruits. What is important is that 2025 will also find those bent on constructive action finding more and better company with whom to undertake it.I wish everyone here the best in 2025. Our people are waking up. Do not focus on the ones who are lost, who are traitors or who are broken. Focus on the small number who are strong and engaged in constructive action. If you don’t know anyone like that, be the first to be that one. You have it in you. We all have it in us. It is going to be a long and multi-generational endeavor filled with struggle and filled with triumphs. We will prevail. We are light in the darkness, if we choose to shine.God bless you to our host and to all here. Happy New Year.

        As long as we’re looking at wins and losses, here’s a couple of mine.WinsTrump &amp; DEIThe reaction to Oct. 7 was a shock to Jews. They discovered that the world put them on Team Whitey, aka Team Oppressor, or just Team Jew. Either way, they weren’t on Team Victim. They also realized that while they had control of Democratic Party politicians, the Dem base hated them.But the GOP loves them and so did Trump. Safer for Israel to get the GOP and Trump in charge than the Dems. That’s why I started to think Trump could win early in 2024.As DEI, if you’re going to be on Team Whites, identity politics doesn’t look at good, so time for colorblind civic nationalism. I saw that coming as soon as the protests really broke out hard.LossesKing CobraI thought that the Cobra was a better con man He was never on our side, but he was on his side, and he shot himself in the foot, likely a fatal shot for high office, but we’ll see.Interest Rates and the EconomyI’ve been wrong about this for several years. I didn’t think the economy could handle the Fed funds rate at this level, but it’s cruised along.

                They severely harmed themselves with those Tweets.  Musk is now throttling opposing views to H1B.  That is going to do him serious damage because “Mr. Free Speech” is now “people who make me sad should be shadow-banned”.
Vivek reminded everyone why they don’t like Indians.

                    Yes, the temptation to squelch MAGA voices after Elon got caught lying about the nature of H1b positions was the most important thing to come out of this kerfuffle du jour.Vowing to root out opposition is not a good look. But he delivered on it by tweaking algorithm sensitivity and encouraging large accounts to block  the objectionable voices, thereby burying them.So was it a planned outburst or did he just bumble into this bad behavior?In the end, the only question that matters is “Are white men losing jobs due to H1B abuse?” And it’s Trump’s response that matters when the rubber meets the road.I suspect Trump is letting Elon stew in his own mess – last thing he wants is sideshows not of his own making before Inauguration.

                        I agree.  Trump doesn’t need to weigh in because Elon and Vivek just got their asses handed to them.  If your MAGA friends are successfully engaged in a beat down of the Trch Bros, why step into the middle of that and risk a haymaker landing on your chin?
The truth of the H1B mess is easily discovered by asking one, simple question:  if those skills are so rare and so valuable, why aren’t the Indians paid well above scale for their talents.
Vivek/Elon’s argument is that the Mets should have paid Juan Soto the league minimums.

                            I suspect part of the reason for hiring Indians is also that a lot of the work they do is viewed as peripheral to the business of the companies that hire them. If you make cars you probably want the best automotive engineers you can get. If you run a sign company you want top notch sign painters, etc… IT though tends to be a back office kind of thing. The public doesn’t really see it. It’s not part of the product and even if it is, there are efforts to hide it and make it seem like it’s not even there. I imagine a lot of short-sighted management types just think “the Indians aren’t that good but they’ll do and who really cares about that computer shit anyway?”

        The only absolutely certain thing about the Trump administration, in 2025 or any other year, will be its 100% backstopping of Our Greatest Ally. Otherwise, all of its stated and unstated goals are subject to successful resistance by the deep state and/or the whims of the Orange Man himself.
It’s not real fortune telling to predict an economic collapse/stock market crash, since sooner or later that’s guaranteed to happen somehow. But nailing the year is quite a coup. Many smarter people than me have tried and failed. But I think 2025 is the year.

            Trump will go for a 2 state solution in the ME.  He hasn’t talked about it, but I think he will take the approach of settling things permanently.  The MIC and IC wouldn’t be trying to stop him if they thought he was just going to keep the war machine running.
Israel largely disappeared from the news during Trump’s first term as he negotiated the various bi-lateral Abraham Accords.  He will also seek a long-term solution with Iran and the Saudis.  All of this to get the petrodollar back on line.

        Z-man you may still be correct on your first prediction on Trump. He won the election but does not have the brass ring yet. I have a hard time believing that a government that attempted assassination will just hand over the reins of power and await prosecution. Never count unhatched eggs and never underestimate what desperate people will do.

            Well, you make an assumption that there will be prosecutions of those that matter.  Perhaps there might be some sacrificial lambs upon whom all have agreed.  As we have seen with his immigration backstroke, I would be very unsurprised to see a similar move on prosecutions. No doubt it is part of the deal for him to receive the brass ring, knowing that any breach of the agreement results in immediate termination.

        2024 will go down as one of the most consequential years in history, simply for the elections.Well, just the American one. In Europe, the people tried to elect nationalists but were quashed. We’ll see what happens with the AfD, but I have a feeling that it will win. As always, the USA leads the way. European regimes still thought it was 2021 and they served their neoliberal mandarins on a silver platter for the GAE, only to see the US reject it all. If nothing else, Trump’s win clears a path for new thinking and popular movements all across the West. That may be the vibe of 2025.

        I am worn out by the intensity and relentless insanity of 2024, and just want to recover and relive some sense of old-timey values and integrity for a while. Toward that end, may I suggest revisiting and re-watching some of the classic movies from the 1950s. Two that come to mind are From “Here to Eternity” and “On the Beach”. Perhaps others here may have a favorite or two that may suggest as well. Happy New Year to all you wretched miscreants and rapscallions.

        I usually avoid the yearly prediction game, but this time I have one, though I’d bet it’ll take more than a year to happen (over-under 21 months). I’m completely serious when I say this: Trump is going to kill us.People say “loyalty” a lot when they talk about Trump. Heisn’tloyal and he doesn’t reward loyalty, but it’s true that he’s big into some kind ofloyalty thing.He wants us to say “loyalty” when we talk about him. It’s prominent in the brand, though what it means is a blur.In our response to the Christmas attack, we’ve shown great disloyalty. Vivek and Elon,they are America, Trump has told us.We’ve said no, we are. These guys are stupid assholes.Look at them.So we’re traitors. Sure, “the left” has prosecuted Trump, stolen millions from him, ruined his and his family’s daily lives and shot him in the face—and Vivek and Elon have called him retard Hitler and shit—but they never did anything as bad as what we’ve now done. We’re the real enemy, theonlyone.The viciousness of his patriotic vengeance against us will shock everyone (and overjoy half of them). First we’reallgetting banned, debanked, everything that “tech” can do to us. Then we’re getting shot in pre-dawn raids and in the streets—for “antisemitism,” racism,hate, etc. Over-under: ten examples, then a thousand morons who still think protesting is allowed. That’s a thousand by single bullet, by cop, by soldier. That’s thebeginning.We’ll be hunted by the Fahrenheit 451 robot hounds. If we congregate, we’ll be bombed. The F-15s are coming out! (I know they’re useless, but it’s a TV show.) He might even make “death camps” real.Wesassed backat the Job Creators (a stock scammer and a corporate welfare queen), the holiest of holy men. They promised us a prosperous future, and we said okay, sure, but when you talk like that, you should in fact feel obligated let us at least keep some tiny percentage of what we already have, and not kill us for sport and rob our pocket change.What could be more antisemitic? More anti-American?

        “People are now perfectly comfortable saying they do not want to live around Indians. This is a massive change that seems to have stunned the great and the good last week.”
We’ll see if the powers that be do anything about it, though. They’ve been ignoring what the American people want for a long time without any repercussions.
﻿I don’t see what the problem is. Not a single country in this world would want their demographics upset like the nations of the west.

        Trump is as much the deep state as Obama, Biden, Bush et al. He serves the monied interest (((groups))) that pay him for clandestine control of the treasury. Being a reality TV show huckster and glorified real estate agent his ethics will blow like a leaf in the wind.

                This. We are living through a civil war amongst the International Jews. They used to have a pretty firm grip on the West, having social engineered the ruling classes of most European countries. That they are being challenged for control by the numerous diversities they imported into the West as a hedge against Europeans does not invalidate the pathway by which we arrived to the present.Pres. Trump is backed by, at least, the faction that includes the Adelman’s. Old man Adelman is known for publicly stating his regret at serving in the US military and wishing that he had served in the IDF instead. His widow gave Pres. Trump $100 million. They certainly aren’t in international communist faction, so they are Empire Faction, but in the subfaction that values retention of Israel as more important than retention of America.

        Yeah, when thinking about the kooks and crazies, I’m reminded of those old westerns when the young soldier and his sergeant are pulling nighttime guard duty in hostile territory: “Gee, Sarge! It sure is quiet out there!” Sarge: “Yeah, TOO quiet!”That’s the way I feel about the fact that the leftists seemed to just have melted away after the election. I never did buy their cheery “Well, the people have spoken! That’s our democracy in action!” Maybe, after all these years of their no-holds-barred viciousness, I’m just paranoid, but I still think the other shoe is about to drop!

        By the end of 2025 Israel and Turkey will be secretly at war with one another, with “incidents” being blamed on “insurgents” and “religious fanatics”. Since both sides are already composed of religious lunatics, this should be a fun show.

        I followed the link and read my own comment from last year. Not too bad, though Trump only got 16% of the black vote instead of the 40% I could not resist the urge to write. lol Still, I believed Trump would improve his lot with blacks and he doubled his support and got more black votes than anybody in 50 years. Does that matter? It does! Not because of what team they’re on, but because of what it means for the status quo political coalitions…which are bleeding out.Other stuff:I got the primaries right, but did not see the Biden coup d’etat comingI got the ballot cases right (SCOTUS)Got the terror war against Russia right (ATACMS missiles, and the Moscow terror attack in March)Also got the “radioactive Ukraine” comment right – nobody talked about it except Trump and Harris/Biden never had to answer questions about it. Ukraine/WW3 is a key reason why Trump won despite never being permitted in the discussion.Got the economy/inflation thing mostly right, but that particular prediction of mine was a pretty safe bet“open calls to deploy the military to the Mexican side of the border” – not too shabby and aligns well with the mass deportations theme of the election and post-election. Ditto the fact that calling people a racist is having zero effect on them, that white people are tired of having their jobs stolen, and that blacks (e.g. Chicago) are close to rioting over mass illegal immigration.DIE is, in fact, dying. I still think it will get rebranded, but DIE is in full retreat at the close of 2024.Trump has not yet called for a 2-state solution with the Israelis and Palis. I think that day is coming, though.No major streaming services went bankrupt. I thought Netflix or one of the big ones might fold.While the Catholic Church did not come out as openly gay, parishoners continue to flee and they especially continue to withhold money from the church because the Pope is not a Catholic Christian and everybody knows it. No big developments after the pope blessed gay couples in December 2023…except continued financial problems for the Church of Rome.Any my last prediction:“At least one Trump assassination attempt. It will fail.”There were two. Both failed. And the first one is simply going to go down in world history as legendary.

        “Another loser was my prediction on Argentina. I said the revolt would begin in the summer, but so far, no revolt.”I’d not beat myself up too much on Argentina.  In fact, I see the situation as one of hope.  Argentina has been in trouble due to socialist government programs for longer than you’ve been alive.  The people have suffered to an extent that they were ready to try anything, e.g.  Milei!  Why is this?  Because they’ve tried everything else.  The people know the problem and are ready for the cure.In there lies my hope for Trump, or a future Trump clone.  The only thing not yet known is whether we’ve suffered enough.

        As the resident Argentine (by residence, not by ancestry or citizenship) with three Argentine grandchildren and an Argentine dtr-in-law, I keep relatively close tabs on the socio-economic-political situation in the country. I was an early supporter Milei and still am, but to a lesser extent than previously. His support in the country remains strong, seeing as his administration has made great strides in paring back wasteful government, in suffocating “woke” in its cradle and in spite of the austerity, still maintaining a high national morale from what I see. His foreign policy is not to my taste. but I see no clear and present danger in it.The frontier guard killing was likely to have been done by narcos. Misiones is a major entry point fordrug traffickers. All is quiet with respect to any potential terrorists or guerillas, who for all practical purposes are non-existent at present.

        Well, shinola. In the latest Coffee And A Mike podcast, Matt Bracken relates how Werner von Braun wrote a science fiction novel, “The Mars Project”, in the 50s, featuring a future Mars colony led by a figure titled Elon.
(Braun’s other book was “I Aim For The Stars”; the inside joke is that the subtitle was “And Sometimes I Hit London.”)

        True…the commie kooks won’t stop until one of us is dead…which I think will be them, since folks like me don’t give any quarter…Trump has so far missed a key thing–banning all voting machines and requiring an auditable hand count…..I predict that Trump will only end the Ukraine aid…and therefore the war, when it is too late, and the Zelensky dictatorship is being overrun…I predict that the Fed will tighten far too late…I predict that Vivek the swindler will continue to infuriate MAGA, until Trump shuts him up permanently…..I predict that Congress will continue to steal trillions of nonexistent cash, which the Fed will continue to print…..

        I didn’t make any predictions for 2024.  I’ve made a few for 2025 but their mostly bummers so I won’t post them here.
Overall 2025 will be a failed attempt to pretend it can be 1985 again, even though 1985 really wasn’t 1985.
For our thing, nostalgia plays no role in survival or sovereignty, and the boomers begin turning 80 in about 366 days.
It’s long past time for the indispensable men who might have been right in 1985 to ride off into evening redness in the west.

        I’m withholding judgment until Trump is actually inaugurated and takes the reins.  It seems the asswipes are plotting multiple ways to F up his administration (&amp; inauguration) from the word go.  I’m cautiously optimistic, hoping for the best, but expecting not so much of the best…
As an aside, in case anyone noticed, I also posted this comment on yesterday’s essay for some reason, and I haven’t even started partying.

        All the bullshit thrown at Trump the last 9 years is proof the establishment is scared shitless of him. I fully expect a huge effort to thwart his plans going forward.It remains to be seen how many republicans continue to throw temper tantrums. If so, many will be “liz cheneyed” in the next election.

            The establishment is not scared of Trump. They fuck with him because it’s easy. No consequences.  They kick him around because they AREN’T scared of him and it’s fun to stomp on weak losers.
These people are cowards at heart. If they actually feared him they would be kissing his ass all the time and competing to win his favor.

            The Establishment doesn’t fear Trump; they fear the people who vote for him and the reason people vote for him.  Look at the over-the-top reaction to January 6.  That is fear.

                The “over-the-top reaction to January 6″ was preconditioned by the preceding gun rights marches in Virginia. Depending on which set of lying police bureaucrats one believes, there were either 40,000 or 110,000 (99% white) men with rifles marching. Of course, those were just the subset that were willing to make a public statement. If it came down to show time, that number would be larger. That was a very unwelcome reminder that they live in a bubble that remains unpopped due to Heritage American forebearance.So, from globohomo’s perspective, the Jan 6 folks, though they were not armed, COULD have been armed, and in their tiny femicommie brains that’s exactly the same as being armed, therefore it was insurrection.

                    This is pretty much it: rigid NPC-scripted femicommie minds embedded in large dollops of fear.
The thing is, imagine the reaction/response of these NPCs if/when they are confronted with an actual insurrection, the real thing.  Their first practical lesson will be that words mean something, despite the never ending best efforts of postmodernist force-fed propagandizing now ongoing for almost 100 years, flowing from the “Frankfurt School” approach to installing communism.
Their next lesson will be that reality is ….. well, it’s reality, no matter how hard they screech at it and pretend otherwise.

        Trump’s comeback was predicted by me as far back as 2021. The thing with Trump is he looks better the more you see of him — unlike most politicians. He also appears less wacky. In 2016, he was a renegade figure of novelty, but fast forward nearly a decade and he seems almost mainstream. My prediction? Count on Trump to have a very successful presidency with a booking economy and wise foreign affairs policy. The man has luck on his side, I’ll give him that.
