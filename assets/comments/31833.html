        I see Generalissimo Zelenskyy has bought King Charles’ former summer residence.  With the King, Princess Kate, and Prince Harry out of the picture, I suspect the next front of the war will be the Conquest of England.Zelenskyy, then, might become the Lucifer (high chamberlain) to King William.White children are 3% of the global child population.That means the next generation of fighting age white males are 1.5 percent.Add in the unknown rates of Covid sterilization of this and the next generation of fertile white females, the picture is worse.  Shedding and culture war add to this.The City of London and the New Covenant (America) are both being terraformed as  are historic Palestina and Khazaria.   An Israel-centered copy of the Belt-Road Initiative (centered around Iran) called IMEC has formalized as a counter corridor for trade and energy.At work here is the capture strategy of circular tax leverage.  A few billions in tax-payer credits is sent from the US (and Germany) to, say, Israel.   That money is returned in the form of buying influence in America and the EU.Toria herself said it plainly:  most of the money remains here, it never leaves the taxpayer country.   We fund our own takeover of key nodes.What has been captured is the entire taxpayer base of not only America, but of Europe and the Anglo Commonwealth.  Their whole economies, in other words.Leverage capture, not mere money laundering and organ trafficking, is the point of Ukraine and Gaza.  Lasso the economies under the aegis of war, or pandemic, or pollution (“carbon”).  Debt bondage in different forms.

            (A side note is that South America is also being colonized, as she was post-1492 Spain for slave plantations of supplying timber for naval ships, quinine for explorers, spices, drugs, food, and silver, by Tribal satraps such as in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.  At the same time, their conquistadores are coming north.)

        Yep, yep and yep. The marches have always been important for Russia. I not going to bother looking up the exact number but for well over half a century preceding WW II, Russia didn’t have one generation without a foreign invader on her soil.&amp; yep, it was a terrible mistake driving Russia out of the west in to the orient, good for Russia, bad for us in the short run.However  if we don’t go ah nuking, it just might make America if not great, at least not so shabby, while making our elite class grate, if not lamp post decorations. Pax Americana has become banana republica. If this Dual New World Order comes about  we’ll have to learn to fish or cut bait.  Competition requires clearing the deadwood rather than stacking it in the halls of government, the media, academia etc., as we’ve been doing for far too long.

        The war has been a brilliant success. And it is now on the cusp of its crowning achievement, global war between the West and Russia. This has always been the goal, a replacement for Lockdown Theater, with War with Russia as the goal. The goal to allow the fig leaf (always vital for them) to crack down and rule by brutal force.“Winning” in Ukraine has never been the issue. The issue has been a draft, military rule, and unfettered hereditary bureaucratic rule by Karens and such. The “natural authority” of black Lesbians and War Karens. Think Gretchen Whitmer outlawing sale of seeds as it would let people grow their own food. Or the use of motorboats on lakes because she did not like it. [Sailboats were ok].The point is War. No one in the West fears either Putin’s military or his nukes. If this is wise or accurate I don’t know, but they don’t fear them. War allows a total draft. Not just military age men for service (to get rid of younger White men on the Russian Front) but older Whites for various military-industrial production. The “immigrants” as paid mercenaries (squatting is legal — your home is theirs) keeping order brutally solves the manpower problem for repression. And a higher IQ slave force all drafted in service for the Bureaucratic elites “saves the planet” etc.So it looks like Ukraine in NATO, and French/German/Polish/UK forces fighting Russia by early summer. So War it is. Brandon might even use it to simply eliminate elections forever; neither Dr. Jill nor First Crackhead are willing to give up the White House.

            They tried that already during 9/11 Iraq Etc. There is a reason so many movies of recent decades spoof 1940s newsreel war propaganda. It is because the aesthetic easily earns cheap laughs from the kids these days. There will be no woke version of “Over There” Capra-corn mobilization of the homefront, which again, had flopped when supposed genius Karl Rove pimped it in service of “realignment” schemes. A weird Islam/Latin-inflected answer to the last time DNC was in Chicago, a round-the-clock live-stream Days Of Rage scenario in every big city, is far more likely than what you prophesize. We all see how they treat their own pet protestors; “when you subsidize something you get more of it.”Per your risible girlboss spectre haunting the West, I see VP Harris is trying to look serious in front of the parents of Israeli hostages. I am not holding my breath that MENA calms down to permit a war in Eurasia.

        I have to take issue with one thing (what a surprise, I know).The idea that Russia is going to leave a “rump Ukraine” or a “buffer zone” behind to cause trouble in the future is one of the strangest tropes current in the alternative news and opinion community today.We all have to be cleareyed about this: There is absolutely no scenario whatsoever under which leavinganyof Ukraine intact does not simply duplicate the exact same conditions that led to the war in the first place. Russia will end up completely destroying the current Kievan regime and conquering all of the Ukrainian state, and even this is only just the beginning.The real question in my mind is not whether this will happen, but to what extent Russia realizes this inevitability. It’s the question that motivates my frustration with the pace of the SloMO. Does Russia not realize this and still hopes for some kind of détente with the West, or does Russia realize this and is playing 5D chess? The fact that it must happen is no longer controversial.

            If Russia wins handedly, my guess is that Poland could be coerced to leave NATO along with Hungary.  Thereby creating a de facto buffer zone.  And when I say handedly I mean to an extent where a country like Poland looks at its two hands, one holding America and one holding Russia and then has to make a decision as to who it wants be allied with.  Who in fact can protect it?  If America is exposed as a paper tiger, I would think new arrangements such as this start happening.  and perhaps create a domino effect.

                You’re crediting the Poles with too much common sense and realism.
One of the great maxims of Continental politics is to never underestimate the ability of the Poles to do the wrong thing at the moment best suited to @$%^ things up for the most people(s).
Honourable exceptions for showing up at the Siege of Vienna and for stopping the Red Cavalry in 1920.

                    Not to mention the timely intervention of the “winged  cavalry” in relieving the siege of Vienna in 1683, which forced the Ottomans to flee posthaste, leaving this powdery dark brown stuff behind, allowing Central Europe to transform it into a rich, more refined beverage. Anyway, rumour has it that Poland’s Law &amp; Justice party prevailed in local elections, so the Euroscepticism isn’t dead there. Yet.

            “It’s the question that motivates my frustration with the pace of the SloMO.”I think the slow pace is do to Russia being content with the Ukrainians sending their men into impossible battles to try to gain territory and getting slaughtered in the process.  Russia has reduced its manpower losses significantly using this approach.  They are slowly gaining territory while keeping their losses in manpower and equipment to a minimum.Meanwhile, Ukraine is losing men and equipment at an astounding (and unsustainable) rate.  There is no reason for Russia to be in a hurry.  When your enemy is busy destroying itself, don’t do anything to stop them.

                Think of it as a wood chipper or meat grinder – you shove too much in at once, and it jams or clogs.  But a steady pace of feeding material gets the job done.  From what I gather, the Russians are at a good pace of destruction vs. supply replacement.  Don’t want to get out ahead of yourself.

            Perhaps, or perhaps they leave what’s left of Ukraine with a friendly (to Russia) government as was the case before CIA intervention in 2014 and seemed to work quite well previously for the USSR in the Warsaw Pact countries after WWII.  Those silly people in Hungry for example decided to run their own country in 1954 and were promptly slapped down with a Soviet invasion.

            I don’t disagree with you, but here’s the counter weight that the Russians are likely considering. Western Ukraine is filled with legitimate Ukrainian nationalists. When we talk about Azov and right sector, they’re almost exclusively from this part of the country. The majority of the East welcomes Russia as liberators, this isn’t true west of the Dneiper. An occupation would risk a low level guerilla war in this part of the country, and these grind down even superpowers (see Afghanistan vs USSR and USA, Iraq, etc). Maybe they are planning on occupying, and this is their reason for trying to take their time and kill as many Ukrainians as possible rather than sweeping to victory and taking land. If they kill all the nationalists, then there will be no one to fight such a guerilla war.

russia doesn’t want nuclear war and it doesn’t want human loses(cause russian women don’t make babies), so it has to move slow and act diplomatic.

            Many reasons, of course.The big one that our guys typically ignore is that a war between the West and Putin is a war between the West and a “westaboo,” a deep unrequited lover of globohomo. That’s why it took him so long to recognize that the war had begun years ago, why he only very belatedly admits, under incredible duress, that he’s the relative good guy, why the grinder will grind on for practically ever to give the wronging lover another and another chance until the end of the world.The conflict ends when one of parties to it *changes*, whatever that means. Putin will not learn. Nuland (metonymically) will not learn. Something else has to happen.Remember: Ukraine was characterized by Nuland and Putin alike as a nazi/nationalist stronghold (until Nuland reframed it as a Zionist one, for the same reason) to bait *men like us* into the trenches. We do not have a side in this—except to oppose death.

        Ukraine is a battle in a war stretching back to antiquity, a civil war between Goblins who seek a world Goblin imperium vs humanity wishing a national sovereignty to live normal decent lives.  To say the “west” is at war with Russia is to pass off Blinken, Nuland, Mayorkas, Yellen, Garland as westerners; they are not.  The United States is a Goblin Occupied Government.  Our system is Goblinism.GOGs get established and maintained by the likes of Epsteins, Lanskeys, perfidious publications.  Having achieved GOGness over the US, it simple grows by utilizing strong arm tactics against any place that it can.   Goblins took over Hungary in 1919, and got kicked out.  Ditto Russia.  And now they are back at it, utilizing a duped Americas population as fulcrum and lever to attack Russia.Goblins exhort tipping over apple carts and grabbing whatever they can.  It’s relatively cost free to engage Goblinism for the Goblins.   Great destruction occurs, but theGoblins slip away.  If they grab some loot fine, or if they don’t, they’ll be back somewhere else.To put a stop to this madness, Goblinism has to bear a cost.  It has to be so expensive that even Goblins are dissuaded from Goblinism.

        I’m wondering now if Europe turns away from America and sides with Russia.  Because they are going to need Russia as a protector.
I know China is not a real military threat, but my guess is Europe, if anything, is going to want to have some muscle between it and China anyway.  Just makes sense.
Plus Russia could kick America’s ass in a real war.  So no one really needs the headache and the sanctimony anymore coming from here.  Perhaps America turns to pushing around countries in central and South America and drifts ever more away from Europe?

            Europe will end up siding with Russia but not for fear of China. Europe will side with Russia because Russia is its natural, low-cost energy supplier and economic partner, and because without the American hegemon Europe is too much of a basket case to rule itself and needs an external source of order.
I also happen to believe, as a purely private matter, that the Third Secret of Fatima will be fulfilled by a Russian patriarch converting to Catholicism and taking over the See of Peter, thus restoring Apostolic Succession to the Roman Church (who lost it at Vatican II).

                you do realize catholic organizations are just as responsible as js in bringing in muslims and blacks into western countries.
virgin mary making an apparition in a town called fatima, which is an islamic figure for people who don’t know, implies the whole event was a psyop, these are the two holiest women in islam.
obviously ‘someone’ is trying to fuse islam and christianity together, under vatican and israeli rule to create a new religion.
converting to catholicism = converting to new world order religion.

                    I have come around to the idea that Catholicism is a necessary antidote to any people who live among the JJJs.  It’s something you need in the first aid kit if you go out into the world and deal with things that can bite you and get you seriously ill.No JJJs and really no need for Catholicism.I wish it weren’t so.  I wish there was a place for the RCC that could thrive independently of the JJJs, but I do not see it.  And as go the JJJs goes the necessity for a Catholic Church as the natural antidote.

                Italy, for one, will side with Russia in a heartbeat.  You could push it over with a feather to Russia’s side.
Its alliance with the USA has always been fraught with doubts and unease and has always been, to my mind, a shotgun marriage.  I am sure Spain and Portugal and Greece will follow.  Greece especially given the Orthodox ties.  Next to fall will be the Baltics and Scandinavian countries.  Ireland.  France.   Last one standing astride the USA ultimately will be England.  At least how I see it.  FWIW

            The US strategy in Vietnam was that Ho would give up in fear once we demonstrated we were serious.
And how did we plan to demonstrate that we were serious? Simple. Get our guys killed in meaningless forays out of FOBs while the REMFs changed the culture in Saigon. Show “we” aren’t afraid to sacrifice, and once Ho grasps that essential fact, he will have to quit.
Didn’t work then. Didn’t work in Iraq. Didn’t work in Afghanistan.
Never again.

The USA chose to go to war against North Vietnam instead using South Vietnam as its proxy.Initially Putin approached the “West” to be a part of NATO.  The USA chose to foment a war against Russia using Ukraine as its proxy.With the exact same “Keep going” strategy.Some people never learn.

        It’s going to be interesting to see what happens to spending on things like the military.  The IC  and FBI/DOJ can blackmail everyone to get what they want.  Tougher for the military to do that.You can’t lose three wars in 24 years, and have your Navy threatened by a bunch of goat herders flying drones, and there not be consequences for those failures.Also note that Sec of State Blinken made public statements last week that Ukraine will be in NATO which were followed QUICKLY by the NATO General Secretary stating that Ukraine will *not* be in NATO.We’ve quickly become a chump third rate power.  A lot of the unipolar world orbited around the fear that the Americans would do something.  That power has been squandered, and now nobody cares what the lying useless sh*tbags in DC think about anything.In a war in which Tweets are fired one direction and bullets are fired in response, bet on bullets.It’s really quite shocking how fast the decline has been since 2001.

                Or at least his paymasters did…Watching what the FBI and CIA have been up to in recent years, it is hard to not to think they played an active role.  My all-time favorite reminder to people about how the Government operates, and it’s a point I’ve been making for 21 years, is that NOBODY WAS FIRED after 9/11.  The CIA Director (a Clinton holdover, George Tenet) kept his job.  The FBI was moving from Louis Freeh to eventually the execrable Robert Mueller (who took over on 9/4/11).  Nothing but sh*tbags.I used to think there was no chance it was an op, but looking back, it’s hard to convince myself otherwise.

        “Without a clear goal, there is no way to measure success.”Sure there is. If viewed as a massive inventory dump, of obsolete equipment, combined with money laundering through the kleptocracy that is known as Ukraine, it all makes perfect sense.“Winning?” Right. How about new orders for equipment, likely combined with the fear-mongering of a ‘new threat from (fill in here)’ to gin it up. Posturing by ‘politicians’ to enhance the threat and save us for our own ‘safety.’Maybe certain parties snap up land. Others, vulnerable women to exploit.

                Me thinks the problem, or at least one, is that the equipment dumped into Ukraine was not necessarily obsolete, but what was touted to be representative of our superior ability when faced with an 1st class opponent.  Seems we—the American public—were sold a bill of goods for in part.For example, we didn’t open up the warehouses and send them archaic WWII bazookas, but rather Javelin missiles.  Those missiles were not nearly as effective as we were told over the years.  More effective antitank weapons are those cheap drones that drop smallish explosives or suicide dives.  Those seem not to be in our field use inventory.But what do I know….

        Does the imposition of the CBDC panopticon totalitarian regime depend on GAE victory in Ukraine/over Russia? I think maybe it does. Hopefully it does. It seems very difficult, if not impossible, for an openly declining and retreating power to impose a financial tyranny of that nature. It seems that such a system would have to come from a position of strength, not one of weakness. Weakness that will be evident to all in the seemingly inevitable event of a western retreat. I wish I’d saved all the quotes from the Davos types about how victory in Ukraine is imperative and essential.I’ve seen it postulated that the Russia sanctions were designed more to keep us in than to keep the Russians out. Perhaps the managers believe they can impose the new tyranny either way. But I’m not so sure they are correct.

            This is an interesting post. In the past decade, Netanyahu has been make the rounds with the power elite, promoting Israel as the center of the new global powers. That is, digital technology taking over from physical wealth creation (oil, gas, minerals and mining, agriculture … …). In the presentations he is promoting Israel as the place where all of the GAE companies making digital hardware and software plant their companies, and it sounds like a silo where all of the data will be stored surveilled … … It is an implicit, sub-text of his talks.Moreover, Israel is engaged in full on non-egalitarian eugenics. They are identifying their super talented young as early as 5 and putting them into their military/cyberscience program to foster and develop them. All this while America is finishing the utter destruction of its K-Phd education system.What I am getting at is I wonder if 10/7 was one front of a war to put the kebash on those plans. Jeffrey Zoar this post brought those to mind. Perhaps, Ukraine as control of the world grain supply between that and the GAE’s flyover zone is part of food and offshoring the digital panopticon headquartered in Israel is the plan.Could it be that Russia’s invasion and then the ensuing 10/7 chaos were parts of a front? I do not know, but it is an interesting thought.Clearly Fink had/has plans for turning Ukraine into an economic zone under total digital surveillance. If or how that may be linked to Netanyahu’s project is unclear. It isn’t out of the realm of possibility.There is no doubt in my mind that control of all physical assets goes through the Climate Change hoax.1. Get the plebs to make crazy sacrifices to save the planet. By the time they realize their dispossession it is too late. Social credit of hating Gaia keeps the protest minimal2. If you can penalize owners, producers and consumers of physical assets you can devalue them and then assume ownership for pennies on the dollar.3. On top of either explicit or de-facto ownership of the assets, you institute a tax regime in the name of Gaia that makes the worst taxation and serfdom regime in world history look like a bargain in comparison.4. Meat printing and food printing companies are already in advanced stages in Tel Aviv, the US and Europe. Of course, if you outlaw these products grown in nature due to some harmless and essential gas, now, “the new powers”, as Netanyahu calls them in his ghoulish accent own the production of food and outlaw any competition. Exceptions for the architects of the matrix of course.I never thought I would root against my country and its ambitions, but, well it isn’t my country and it hasn’t been in a long time. May Ukraine fall and weaken the occupiers who seek the destruction of me and my nation.

        “While the Russians have not talked about what comes next, it is clear they will turn Ukraine into a demilitarized buffer zone with a government friendly to Moscow.”
One problem I see with this is that if Russia peels off the pro Russian areas from Ukraine, is there going to be enough of a critical mass of pro-russian people left in rump Ukraine to keep Russian friendly governments in power? Isn’t that why these breakaway regions were grafted onto Ukraine in the first place?

            I think they’ll do what they did in Georgia: keep enough of the country to end forever talk about Ukraine joining NATO.  The bit of non-Russian Ukraine that is left will have a government living under the Sword of Damocles with Russian holding the sword.The Moscow terror attack might be a sign of things to come.  NGO’s operating out of Ukraine with CIA funding launching terrorism against Russia and Russia-controlled Ukraine.The media went to great lengths last week to “debunk” various rumors (some rather silly) that Zelensky was buying property in places like Florida.  Most likely that is exactly what he is doing, and the Government Party plants fake news to discredit anybody who brings it up.Zekensky probably goes into exile in the West by summer.

        At this point, the only thing I am concerned about regarding Ukraine is where Zelensky and his coethnic faux-Ukrainians end up, with all their millions, and whether any of the actual Ukrainians scattered by this unnecessary war ever return to Ukraine.  I would like to see Zelensky and his Dior-loving wife dropped in the middle of Gaza, and I would like to see the blonde Ukrainian women and children sold off to Arabs freed and returned home.

I can think of many other things I’d like to see happen to Zelensky.  It is the same thing I want to see happen to the house members who were bowing down to him and “honoring” him.

        All the changes to civilization over the last 60 years and before is predicated on “progress” and the superiority of the system over all others.
Despite the decline being noticed by many, the narrative of progress still holds in the minds of most sheeple.

        I understand there are some interesting things going on in the US and German military these days.The U.S. Navy recently changed its recruiting policy and no longer requires enlistees to have high school diploma or GED. And Navy retirees may be recalled to active duty.That’s really convenient considering how many military-aged illegals just crossed the border in the last three years. Like G. W. Bush did during the Gulf War, non-US citizens will be granted citizenship if they sign up. I could imagine the other services will do the same thing to recover their dismal recruiting levels.The US Air Force is currently recommissioning  B-1 and B-52 bombers back in to service. Guess they don’t really trust the stealth capability of the B-2. As you may recall, back in 1999 over Serbia, a F-117 “stealth fighter” was shot down by a Russian S-125, which is a missile system from the early sixties.Here at home our Defense Minister Boris Pistorius just announced a restructuring of the German Bundeswehr, including a new central command and a dedicated branch for cyber space.I guess we all know where this is heading…

            It’s only one B-1 to replace another one damaged beyond repair:https://www.twz.com/air/b-1b-lancelot-is-being-resurrected-for-active-serviceThe B-52’s are bring re-fit w/ new engines and avionics to bridge the gap until ‘enough’ B-21’s enter service. This has been a decade in the making:https://www.twz.com/our-first-look-at-what-fully-upgraded-b-52-bombers-will-look-like
Overall, it seems like it is about lack of quantity and a low readiness rate among the existing craft in operation. All 3 types in service are long in the tooth, but unlike the B-1 &amp; B-2, the B-52 is simple enough to endure a while longer with some improvements.

            B-52 commissioning is by treaty with Russia—whatever that means these days.  We are allowed something like 50 functional and another 50 in the boneyard (I live next door to it).  If one of the active fleet is lost, by treaty, a bone yard one can be put into service.  The B1 bombers fill the boneyard, but the total fleet was 100 and a few of them were lost over the years.  What it takes to recommission them, I can’t say.  Worse still, is the remaining fleet of Warthogs—less than 200  (out of 700-900) and the Air Force wants those decommissioned.  Lots of arguing going on, but eventually we will have no lingering air to ground support for the Army.

                Yeah, taking the nukes out of the B-1’s was part of START IIRC. B-52’s being the oldest &amp; slowest were left largely alone and I bet B-2 limits weren’t even on the table. However, to Karl’s point, since neither treaty adherence nor discretion seem important to certain people, we shouldn’t be shocked if more B-1’s suddenly started getting pulled out of the boneyard and restored to nuclear capability. Because, you know.The A-10’s are deemed as too vulnerable in a peer or near peer arena. Maybe so, but they can operate from darn near anywhere on a shoestring unlike an F-35. Plus, the 4 stars want to blow the $ on more expensive and less proven toys vs. Warthog maintenance.Won’t matter much as there will only be so much fuel to put in any of them since the SPR is at about 50%, and there seems to be no hurry to replenish it.

            Just to note that the Navy recruitment plan for those with no high school diploma is that a minimum ASVAB score is still required , meaning that they’re looking for that very thin slice of GAE subjects with the ability to get an imperial diploma (for what that’s worth) but for whatever reason didn’t get one.

        The cavalier attitude toward nuclear war has delegitimized the GAE. Along with the open borders, which are an abdication of the first obligation of government–to protect its citizens, the right to rule by consent has been forfeited. This does not necessarily mean the GAE will disappear in the near future, or that its grip on power will recede soon. In fact, oppression and irresponsibility are likely to grow worse now. The forfeited agreement to govern through consent probably will give way to rule by brute force in the end stages.  We see the outlines of that even now.If Western culture, which is distinct from the Empire, can be preserved, that obviously should be done, but as you noted at the end the Regime may go full Scarface, yelling “look, ma, I’m on top of the world” as it engulfs humanity in a fire ball. This has been a possibility for two years and may be a probability now. It is hard to see factions this deranged yielding to reality.It is a very dangerous moment.

                Putting aside the open question of whether or how much the “president” actually controls the use of nuclear weapons, I’ve had the impression for a good while now that “Biden” is inspired by/taking a page from Reagan. To wit, propagate and promote the story that this crazy old coot has his finger on the button and just might push it. Whether true or not, it gives one’s adversaries pause. And people wonder why Putin is reluctant to respond to western provocations.

                        That’s why the range of nukes from target needs to be a far as possible.  If too close, the launch on detection of incoming missiles becomes more and more likely. The submarine fleet however makes this impossible it would seem, but still keeping them out of Ukraine is reasonable.

            “ The cavalier attitude toward nuclear war has delegitimized the GAE.”
Anyone who grew up in the Cold War remembers the concern for the “future of humanity” and the handwringing about nuclear weapons that was pervasive through arts, film, and literature.
Totally gone now, and it makes me think that they never cared in the first place, and that it was just typical political posturing.  They liked the Soviet Union, and now they despise Putin and that is really all it was.
The cynic in me suspects that had liberal Carl Sagan survived, even he might be supporting this brinkmanship.

I’ve had similar thoughts.
At least in the ’80s, most people seemed to have some concern about dying in a nuclear holocaust.
Now, people just don’t care. Heck, most people don’t even seem aware how close the world is to nuclear annihilation. It’s sickening.

            I have written several comments on this topic over the years here, so I will keep this brief. It’s likely that a very large portion of the US nuclear arsenal will be duds because the plutonium triggers will no longer fire.These triggers were built at the Rocky Flats facility outside Boulder, Colorado. The triggers had a 25 year design lifespan. Rocky Flats closed in 1992, which means the newest production run of triggers is 32 years old, and most are much older.The government maintained a test production facility at Sandia Labs in New Mexico, but it’s not big enough to supply an arsenal. The truth is that nobody knows how many of our nukes will fail to detonate.Rocky Flats was a Superfund site. It was cleaned up and sold to developers who constructed a huge subdivision called (no joke) Candelas on the land. It’s a perfect metaphor for the financialization of the US social capital.

                    That’s just it, as Guest infers, there wouldn’t be one, especially since, as almost everyone suspects, Russia’s arsenal is in pretty much the same sorry shape.
Even before the nuke doesn’t even go off one has to worry if the rocket would even launch (doubtful) and guide itself to the location successfully (ditto).  The rumor always was that the sub based nukes were still viable, but that’s looking iffy too after the Brits couldn’t get their tridents to launch properly.

                        Given what we’ve seen from the Russian military so far, I wouldn’t assume their nuke dud rate would be so high in the event of conflict.
I’d also bet their anti-ballistic missile systems are pretty effective.

            “Western culture, which is distinct from the Empire…”A very important distinction that should be dispersed far, wide and often. As a long-time ex-pat, I find myself making this point over and over with the folks I know here who often fall into the error of conflating them. I always add that Western culture and the civilization that arose from it will outlast the “Empire”, this latter nothing more than a by-product of a parasitic infestation that will run its course and be anathematized thereafter. The West will abide, albeit in almost certainly a manner well-nigh unimaginable to many of those who survive the shake-out, but abide it will. Not so much in North America and parts of Europe, perhaps, but so glorious a culture and civilization is not destined for extinction. .

        In Japan during the WWII, the military ran the country and turned it into a tyrannical state. The Japanese people were constantly browbeat by propaganda. While at the beginning of the war, Japan’s armed forces won countless victories extolled by propaganda of the defeat of a “lazy, decadent West” by Asians.Then when the tide turned (Midway was an important step, but it was the Solomons Island campaign where Japan lost its experienced aircrews and would never take the offensive again), the propagandists turned defeats into victories, yet they could never explain why Japan was constantly shrinking the boundaries of the Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Or why the number of sons coming home in caskets continued to increase and more sacrifices were required of the average Japanese citizen to “win the war.”They called this senshoubyou, or “victory disease.”I think the U.S. is in the same boat. For months, Western media gave us these nonsensical stories about Russians running out of ammo and using shovels, Putin dying of cancer and the ultimate Ukrainian victory. Like with the Japanese state-controlled media (ours is just as under lock and key as the Japanese were),  our media continues to pitch their narratives in the face of objective reality, which is an overwhelming Russian victory.Now, they struggle to explain how the Western “wonder weapons” are not giving Ukraine an easy victory over a Russian military that will end this conflict as the world’s best land army.This can’t be explained away. While I doubt most normie grillers who dutifully took the COVID-19 vaccine and followed all of the “expert guidance” on social distancing and other silly authoritarian claptrap will either shrug their shoulders and go back to watching sportsball, many on the fence will see the lying liars that run our society for what they are. You don’t need a majority to start a revolution and there will be consequences for our ruling class from this needless debacle.

            Agreed.At this point, none of the western country’s gov’ts are running with the approval and consent of their people. Here in Canada, Turdo La Doo is guaranteed a massive loss in the next election. Macrone in Fwance is in a similar boat. Germany and Poland are against further war in the ‘Kraine. These pro-war gov’ts are going to start to fall soon, and not only because of the ‘Kraine. Globohomo Inc’s attacks on industry and agriculture are infuriating the dirt people and their intent in doing so is clear as day. You cannot run a country like this.Rumours are that plans are in progress within the regime to prematurely remove or retire Biden and pin the loss of the war on him, and that is obvious in all the other countries as well. The wild card in all this is Putler.Doug MacGregor thinks Putin will begin a major offensive this spring when the ground firms up. I am not so sure… it IS plausible, handing the Ukes another devastating defeat will certainly crank up the heat on our western leaders and their puppet masters… but as everyone notes… these are stupid, clued out people and they’d almost certainly respond stupidly to the provocation as they have been for the last two years.Is it possible that Putler will wait until these cancerous left wing gov’ts fall – and he has rational adults to deal with?We will find out soon I suppose.

                Poland (in the sense of its government) is against further war in the Ukraine? That would be welcome news to this European, since all I’m hearing from them is grandstanding rhetoric.
As to the attitude of ordinary Poles, I have no idea.

                I agree.  The Russian way of war is working so well that I am not sure they need a big arrow offensive.   I guess at the point the Ukraine Army is retreating so fast that the Russians can’t keep up, a big offensive may be necessary.Macon’s subordinates talking to Shoigu about freezing the conflict and inserting NATO troops into Western Ukraine will only make the Russians conclude that most of Ukraine must be conquered.It seems to me that NATO wants to put troops into Western Ukraine and either try to end the conflict with a rump Ukraine or divide up Western Ukraine.   Black Rock has to make some money on this you understand.    In the end I suspect Russia will not allow that.   Poland will probably have to say hello to their new neighbor.

                    Europe should be suspicious of Poland, they’re rearming fast and it’s with designed for offense it seems. They have fantasies of a Baltic to Black empire so its neighbors should be watching them closely. The government is making all the Russia evil noises but I think they have their eyes on the territory of some of their supposed allies. Poles seem to be as deluded as Ukrainians in many ways.

        “Note that no one in the West is ever asked by the media why they are doing this.…This is why the West is headed to a crisis over the war. Without a clear goal, there is no way to measure success.”There is no need to ask questions when one already knows the answer: Hitler. Hillary called Putin “Hitler” all the way back in 2014 when the CIA was overthrowing the Yanukovich government:https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clintons-putin-hitler-comments-draw-rebukes-as-she-wades-into-ukraine-conflict/2014/03/05/31a748d8-a486-11e3-84d4-e59b1709222c_story.htmlThere is no clear goal and no endgame because ZOG is a totalitarian empire and everything it does is justified by saying “Hitler.”The only endgame is chronic war to keep the proles whipped up into supporting anything the Regime is doing at any given moment.Hitler has become the Emanuel Goldstein of our post-1984 empire…

        At the end of this, Poland is who people should watch. They are already making plans to rapidly expand their military and some commentators seem to think they might decide to get some land back of their own. On one side, a country finally footing the bill for defense without tugging the GAE’s apron strings is a huge plus. On the other side, the Poles are not exactly known for smart geopolitics and if they do something dumb, we’ll be pushed into their stupidity.

            Chet:  Poland, under globalist Donald Tusk, is dangerous.  They have drafted a hate-speech law to protect non-Whites and sexual deviants.  Tusk shut down opposition media and has gone after nationalist politicians.  The Poles want to be part of the cool kids’ club, and Tusk is a favorite in Brussels.  The Poles have decided they hate the Russians more than they care about the future of their own people.  The media terms this “restoring democracy” after he defeated the “populists.”  Now I just hope the rot doesn’t spread further east.

                Donald Tusk of 2024 is the Wojciech Witold Jaruzelski of 1984. Nothing he does is without the blessing of Da Big Boss. Amazing how “we” became the mirror image of the old adversary.

            “At this moment we want to give the Polish soldier absolute justice.  At many points the Pole fought bravely.  His lower leadership made desperate efforts, his middle-grade leadership was too unintelligent, his highest leadership was bad, judged by any standard.  His organization was — Polish.”
I think you can guess who spoke those words.

            It isn’t their land. The reason those people are Greek Catholic is because that was Orthodox land before. Poland took it and tried to convert them to Roman Catholicism. The peasants rebelled and a compromise solution came about where they got to keep all the external trappings of Orthodoxy but fell under the Pope. If you look at how things were last century, those people don’t like Poles any more than they like Russians.

Poland is a pipsqueak when it comes to things like industrial steel production.

        Dementia Joe is the poster child of Western decline, and yet there are still tens of millions of Americans who believe that he is the “right man for the job” and want him to return for a second term as president. That alone tells you that we are way way overdue for a culling of the stupid. Even worse, the stupid among us have no friggin idea how stupid they are. They genuinely believe they are on the right side of history, and it will be rainbows and puppy dog tails all the way down. Can you fix stupid that is this stupid?NO, not with education or persuasion or voting harder. History teaches that only a 2×4 upside the head will have any chance of success. The real value of Russia winning in Ukraine is that it will trigger the cascade leading to collapse of the West sooner rather than later. That is both a mercy and a necessity. Putin is doing us a great favor by kicking NATO ass and thereby forcing us to wake up and smell the coffee. A fast hard bottom awaits us, and it too is overdue.

                Posts like these always bother me. Despite the insanity we live in, the world I experience is still pretty good – when one considers historical and global comparisons. People seem to think collapse is some sifting process and that the “good” will remain. Collapse is not likely to usher in a new golden era. “The worst is not so long as we can say, ‘This is the worst.&#x27;”To me, this is akin to those who fantasize about zombie apocalypses: One believes they will be the survivor running through the woods with his AK, not recognizing that he will, more likely, be one of the dead.Collapse is not something to welcome, especially if you have kids.Do you believe the agitated minority groups will sit quietly and go away when things devolve? Will the government just allow counter-forces to form?Further, there are many more stupid than smart. And when it comes to culling, the stupid are often the last round.

                    The collapse may not occur in social strife, but in an inward repurposing of America in a world of competing powers.  True, this is not 100% inevitable, but still a possibility.
For example, the US in response to China and the growing Taiwan threat is subsidizing chip manufacturing over here and thus lessening dependency on a foreign country we cannot or will not defend.  The first of 3 such plants here in AZ in now opening for production.
White pill for today…

                    It’s well to remind ourselves that collapse means chaos, and people who believe chaos can be tamed to advantage often end by being consumed themselves.

                    Eloi, no disrespect, but it sounds like you don’t think you’re going to make it to the other side and therefore burying your head in the sand is somehow a benefit. The collapse is coming no matter how you “feel” about it. The evolutionary imperative is to survive this challenge or die and eliminate your genes from the gene pool. Your choice.

                        I recognize that in chaos, even the strongest person still has to sleep. In a chaotic collapse, odds of your death increase – not decrease. Not sure why you put “feel” as if your statement has less “feel.” Yours is the fantasy of a reset, ignoring that those who dissent are the first to be lined up against the wall.I don’t care about whites in general or society; I care about my kids. And the problem is people seem to think that a collapse is going to benefit whites as a race. This treats history as repeating rather than unfurling.What is more likely is a societal collapse will institute a totalitarian government (after all – do you really think that the federal government will disappear?) where the whites will be sicced upon by the diverse bunches. My quotation before was not to be glib; I truly believe that as society collapses, we will have a totalitarian one world government where the attack on whites will continue even further. This is not something to look forward to and wish for.In short, I do not believe societal collapse bodes well for my kids compared to the current moment, or even the gradual decay. Not every rainbow has a pot of gold at the end.

                        Again, many of you are Marxist in that you assume a pre-ordained end to history – or at least an assuredness that collapse will lead to a better scenario long-term, not worse. This is not assured.

                        Eloi:  I do not automatically assume that a collapse will guarantee a better outcome.  I do assume that continuing as things are will result in a catastrophic outcome for the future of White people.  I believe the risk – which accompanies any change – is worth the possible reward.  And I’d rather see Whites go down fighting than gradually disappear as a weak, apologetic, miscegenated mess.

                        In a family on both sides of purely northwestern European, I find I am the last of my line. It once disturbed me, but no longer does. I have three grandchildren who, genetically, are mestizos, though their physical appearance is completely NW European and they are being raised culturally as same. I’ve come to believe that “Pure White” genetics may not carry the advantages that once they did, seeing as we seem to have become an endangered species. It may be up to a hybrid cadre to keep the culture and civ of NW Europe alive in other lands than those of the north, never mind the NW of Europe. I have high hopes for my grandchildren, however, and so far, so good!

                    Collapse/Chaos = OpportunityI recognize that as a single man w/ no children I’m not encumbered with familial responsibilities.  In many ways it is men like us who are most dangerous as we genuinely have very little to lose.  There are A LOT of single men in the West these days, so maybe you understand why there is so much clamoring for collapse.  If anything it would at least give us some purpose in life, something to fight for.

            Someone once said that the majority of democracies decline once the citizens learn they can vote themselves benefits from the public treasury.
Further, when this nation was set up, it was perhaps with good reason that only White wealthy land-owning and [presumably] highly educated men were allowed the vote. And, for all practical purposes, from those were chosen public officials, elected or appointed. Turns out that giving the vote and job opportunities to anyone with a pulse may not be in a republic’s (please note that I did not say “democracy’s”) best survival interests.

                And by extension: simply loot the Treasury without voting to determine what people want.
The whole Ukraine funding thing is basically the Government Party ignoring voters and trying to hide what they’re doing.  The public ain’t having it, and the Government Party still fears what people might do to retaliate.
ESPECIALLY if they can somehow get US formally at war in Ukraine.  American soldiers/airmen/sailors getting killed at a rate of 30,000 per month will lead to terrorism here at home.

            It never ceases to amaze me the parallels between the Soviet Union in its waning years and what we’re seeing from our government today. I think Putin had a point when he said that at its base level, our government doesn’t operate that much differently from the Soviet government. Good riddance to the GAE. It’s an unsustainable burden and I’m glad we’re going to be rid of it.

        I submit that Western leaders did have an objective in mind when they provoked the war with Russia via the Ukrainian proxy.  That objective was to crush the Russian economy under sanctions, provoke massive civil unrest, remove Vladimir Putin from office, and replace him with a pliable leader who would return to the 1990s when western oligarchs were allowed to plunder Russia.  Long term, Russia might be divided up into different regions for easier plundering.That objective was totally unrealistic and sanctions have, in fact, backfired;  The Russian economy is thriving and Vladimir Putin is possibly the most popular leader in the world.  And since the objective of the proxy war had no basis in reality, western leaders have no “fall back strategy,” other than to just continue to the war (to the last Ukrainian) and hope “something will turn up;”  In fairness, however, to the US leadership, if the objective was to cripple the economies of western Europe, the Ukrainian proxy war may be succeeding marvelously.  The UK has been in recession for a year and Germany is deindustrializing.

            The stated goal was “to weaken Russia.” Western leaders dance around it, but Ukraine’s welfare never was a major consideration. It is reasonable to assume the United States also wanted to cripple Germany’s industrial base and cement European dependency. The former happened but I’m not at all convinced the latter will.

            Yep, the neocons will view this whole episode as a draw. In their minds, here’s the scorecard:Wins:1. A lot of dead Ukrainians and Russians2. Europe is even more dependent on US3. NATO enlarged4. Lots of $ and weapons for MIC5. Germany deindustrialized with some industry moving to US6. Germany and Russia cooperation dead for a generation or more7. US nat gas industry has a new customerLosses:1. Putin more popular – but we’ll get him later2. Russia more powerful than ever – but they’ll fall apart later3. Russia and China are tight – but we’ll break them up laterYou’ll notice that the neocons are missing all kinds of other losses, but they’ll never see them because they lack self-awareness. As to the other losses, they figure that they can work on them later because they’ll never be fired because they run the show.I doubt that the neocons will much of anything from Ukraine.

        Europe reminds me of descriptions of Byzantium towards the end: hammered by a Christian crusade from their west, just waiting for the Arabs/Turks to deliver the coup de grace.

            The USA was fine to let Western Europe LARP as world powers, it was part of the deal after WW2 for them to maintain some pride. In reality they accepted their vassal status and loss of sovereignty in exchange for material trinkets. This arrangement works great as long as the empire is strong, but when the empire starts to decline, you’re going to be the first to go and it’s not going to be fun. Britain, France, and Germany are now the passengers in a car being driven off the cliff by a lunatic, and they have no way of grabbing the wheel.

A good rule of thumb is, if you have foreign military bases on your land, you are not a sovereign country. It’s getting worse that Europe has grown fat on social services due to us being their military, and now they don’t have the money or will to rebuild, and their social services are reaching a breaking point. It’s a real possibility there will be a vast self-deportation as western economies systematically collapse.

        “Ukraine did not want to go to war and was ready to take the deal on offer, until Washington sent Boris Johnson in to convince Zelensky to go to war in exchange for unlimited money and supplies.”This mirrors what happened in 1939 with Poland vis-a-vis Germany; the argument over the Danzig Corridor (forcibly taken from Germany by the Versailles Treaty) &amp; it’s link to the German city of Danzig (now Gdańsk). Hitler was trying to make a deal with the Poles &amp; very nearly had one until the British swooped in &amp; told Poland not to give in to German demands. The British – along with the French – told Poland they “had their back” which of course they didn’t in reality. So Poland gets belligerent with Germany &amp; incurs a war &amp; gets crushed from two directions (the Soviet Union invaded  Poland from the east 15 days after the Germans attacked) &amp; wound up being under a totalitarian boot heel until the 1990’s.Eastern Europe was later thrown in Stalin’s lap by FDR who was snookered entirely by the Soviet leader, thinking him “Uncle Joe”. Churchill – to his credit – tried to warn FDR off of him but FDR was probably too interested in screwing the British pound over to supplant it with the U.S. dollar as world reserve currency.That’s what happens when you listen to the feckless west. And France has been a “pipsqueak nation” pretty much since June 18, 1815. They never got over 1870/71, the 1917 mutiny or 1940.

            &gt; FDR who was snookered entirely by the Soviet leader
FDR’s administration was filled to the brim with admitted communists. Joe McCarthy drastically *underestimated* the amount of communist infiltration.
Furthermore, FDR lied to the Portuguese telling them he planned to sneak attack Japan in order to provoke the Pearl Harbor attack (he knew the Japanese were intercepting Portugal’s diplomatic cables.)
He was a bigger war-monger than Uncle Joe. He was anything but “snookered”.

                None of this “sneak attack” was necessary, nor have I ever seen such in the alternative historical narrative.  What is known though is that the US sanctioned most of Japan’s oil supply and that immediately threatened all of Japan’s military adventures.  They then needed to secure such supply and that meant neutralizing the one power that could stop them, the USA.

No, it is not. The US clearly was not neutral, but taking non-belligerent actions against the Japs hardly means they were wanting them to bomb Pearl Harbor. Rather, they were doing whatever they could to weaken who they considered to be the enemy without actually getting into the war. The US simply misjudged the Japs.

If the U.S. government didn’t get a Pearl Harbor attack, it would have had to create one.

                Mr. Generic, I sincerely doubt that FDR was personally capable of doing anything that you just described him as having done; his brain had long since been scrambled by syphilis.
The agent who was most likely to have been responsible for the sleight-of-hand you’re describing would have been Henry Morgenthau Jr.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgenthau_Jr.#Early_life_and_education
Morgenthau oversaw everything for more than a decade.
Nothing happened unless Morgenthau approved it.

You can’t blame Stalin for that. I’m not talking about the bought off or color revolution-installed people inside the governments, but the average man on the street in any Slavic Eastern Orthodox country (except Romania and Ukraine) look favorably on the Russian people.
With regard to the Roman Catholic countries, the idea of a pan-slavic brotherhood arises from time to time. It’s not really a terrible idea, but there are always other forces trying to get in the way.

        The west is still living in a world of delusion. The media proudly trumpeted the “Zelensky peace plan” he was passing around in Davos. They key points were:1. Russia ceding all territory to Ukraine including Crimea2. Russia handing over its generals for war crime prosecution.3. Russia will pay Ukraine reparations for the war.Of course, this is insane. This is what the could offer if they had Moscow surrounded, but that’s not going to happen. It just shows the complete disconnect from reality our leaders have, yet they still persist. The floated Trump proposal (basically a ceasefire in exchange for Crimea and Donbas, which is probably the best deal Ukraine can get right now) had them all reach for the smelling salts, and Blinken’s proudly proclaimed Ukraine will join NATO last week. This will just redouble Russia’s efforts to grab territory. I think we will need to see Kiev captured and evidence of western elite misdeeds in this country starting to leak out (P. Diddy style) before they come to their senses.

            If Trump actually proposed trading Donbas and Crimea for a ceasefire, dear God… the BOM really knows how to show he’s as delusional as the ruling class.

                Other way around – Ukraine gives up Crimea and Donbas in exchange for a ceasefire. Remember this is the same political class that, 12 months ago, was absolutely convinced that Ukraine was going to take back Crimea after the glorious counteroffensive. Instead we got a few weeks of them driving American tanks into open fields and getting blown up by drones.

            Russia would never settle for only that. They’re going to probably take everything east of Dnieper River, probably more than that even.
I haven’t been following the news for the past several years, only reading blogs like this. Once you realize everything is a lie, I’m not going to subject myself to their propaganda anymore. Soviet Union 2.0.

            The warm water port and naval base in Sevastopol, Crimea, is of critical strategic importance to Russia.
The GAE knows this, and it explains their obsession with Crimea.
The prospect of losing Sevastopol for any length of time is the sort of thing that would get Russia thinking about breaking out tac nukes.

        I am a project manager by trade.  When I talk to an exec about a new project idea, it’s my job to get their heads out of the sky and talk about specific, measurable deliverables – and what it will require in terms of people, money, and time to achieve.  They hate that stuff, but most realize that’s how things get done.Seems like nobody has had that conversation in an admiration since WWII.  Every war since is just a mix of graft and stupidity.  Ray McGovern is on the Duran right now talking about how the people running the Ukraine war have the same stupid arrogance as the ones who ran Vietnam and Afghanistan.

        Europe, the land of many great and powerful empires over the centuries, has been a pipsqueak for nearly 100 years now – and the US is following along in kind.  All frantically allowing, if not encouraging a flood of s*** colored sludge to degrade their former White nations, because diversity is our strength don’t you know.  At least Russia is standing up for its legacy people – and history.  Would that we had the same kind of leadership.

        Americans will accept the same lie about losing in Ukraine as they did about losing in Iran, Afghanistan, and Viet Nam: “If only we had taken the gloves off, sent troops, more weapons, more money, we would have won!”(conveniently forgetting the US started this by training and equipping Ukrainians more than a decade ago)This time might be different: the US has already demonstrated a willingness to attack strategic level civilian infrastructure (NordStream) and quite possibly civilians directly at the Crocus City Hall.False flags are very much on the table.  Annie Jacobsen’s new book about nuclear war presents a scenario where a nuke pops off over the US Diablo nuclear power plant in California; it’s so awful, it’ll make you want to throw up.Nuclear power plants are forbidden by treaties to be targeted even in nuclear war.  The US doesn’t seem to much care (NordStream, Crocus, Agent Orange, napalming civilians, etc.)If it wasn’t an election year the US could declare victory and run; it’s not, so the madness intensifies.

        “How will the typical Frenchman react when he realizes he is a citizen of a pipsqueak country? How will the typical flag-waving American feel when he realizes he no longer lives in a superpower, but in a regional power that is in steep decline?”I would politely argue that the average Jacques or Joe is way ahead of the political Elites in both countries.I think the average Frenchman understands precisely his situation. He goes downtown to get a loaf of bread and sees Africans everywhere and a mosque under construction. France’s (arguably) best and most famous author’s last few novels were titled “Submission” and “Serotonin” (both amusing reads, unless you’re a middle-aged man like me haha). In the former, France gives into Islam. In the latter, a middle-aged depressed guy loses his girlfriend and slowly goes nuts.The average American sees decline everywhere around him – Walmart, at work, on TV, in what’s left of his “community”.Admittedly, it’s an inversion of the normal collapse pattern, wherein the Elite have more information about how bad things are. Since the Elite have decided to run a system totally disconnected from feedback from their own societies, they are going to be shocked at how Ukraine and many other debacles unfold.

            The average Brit or Frenchman can look out his window and see Muslims and Africans walking down the street.  Maybe the dots will actually connect about how their countries were conquered by their old empires and why they are drifting down into mediocrity.

The invasion was *begun* with gestures of theatrical irony—Algerians to Paris, Jamaicans to London—to establish a rhetorical/symbolic frame for “us” and, more significantly, a sense of *vengeful unity* in the summoned horde of miscellaneous browns.
Blowback is a narrative device, never photographed in the wild.

Yeah, it all jumped the shark a fair while back. Kind of why I believe that ‘normie grillers’ will, in the main, not really be reached. Some will. But most won’t.
Not that I wouldn’t want or desire a mass awakening, of course. May the Good God deliver it.

        The end game will be a reordering of the world and a necessary reordering of the Western view of itself and its role in the world.I sort of agree with the first part, they’ll be some sort of reordering. But the reordering of the Western view of itself? Not so sure, Mr. Z Man.Don’t forget, we live in countries where even today most people who gleefully went along with the Shamdemic either have buried it in their minds, or defend the tyranny that arose as ‘necessary’. Even then, the incredible damage being done (most markedly to small businesses that needed ‘feet-through-the-door’) was obvious. The evil was obvious.In that light, I do not believe The West’s ‘Elites’ will change their view one iota. They’ll either double-down or move onto the next in a long string of hysterical scenarios. And the publick will no doubt swallow it.When you ask:How will the typical flag-waving American feel when he realizes he no longer lives in a superpower, but in a regional power that is in steep decline?Whilst I’d love it for many to come to this realisation, I just don’t believe they will. Satan has his grip on the minds of the most powerful and influential. And also on those of the lackeys and lickspittles, and I just don’t think Joe Normie will wake up to this, after those aforementioned parties have ramped up their propaganda efforts.To be fair, whatever the outcome in The Land of Plenty of Grain, eyes seem to be on the Jewish-Raghead Desert War for now; so it wouldn’t surprise me if it is just mentioned as a mere footnote, drowned by the next wave of hysteria.I hate to harp on about it, but we must never forget theabsolute enormityof the Covid con job, and how many, even in the face of stark reality doubled-down or memory holed past actions. It is an instructive device in evaluating a person’s ability to recognise certain things about the world.

            A covid fanatic recently said this to me: “Why are you still talking about covid? Nobody cares about it anymore. Move on!”
I can’t move on when even some close people revealed their demonic side and are still remorseless; and the people in charge, our “elites” and “public servants”, are still in their spots, without any accountability.
I live my life and don’t waste my time thinking too much about this, but I will never forget.

                Hun,
This is exactly the sort of behaviour I’m talking about it. Just forget it! Just bury it!
You don’t need to go into any details, you just need to know that it was – certainly in my 40 years on the planet – the most incredible hoax perpetrated on the peoples of the West. That’s all.

                    It was worse than a hoax. To me the world ended in 2020. So many people who I thought I knew as decent and good, turned out be the opposite. All institutions, all leaders, the whole system has turned into total crap. Trust is lost forever, belief in basic human decency is gone…

                        Covid was valuable as a clarifier, no? You could have found yourself in an even worse situation and thought certain people around you were reliable, you could have continued to blindly believe these institutions deserved your trust, and you could have continued to place your faith in a system that is utterly depraved. You have learned valuable lessons, and just because the vast majority failed to do so does not reduce that education. I lost my best friend (and others) over it, and am better off for it.

There was no redpill redder than Covid. We are living through a horrible time and cannot afford illusions.

It’s a generational thing.  Boomers will never reach come-to-Jesus civic enlightenment, but the rising generations will mature knowing that they live in a formerly-great nation.  In a century, every American mongrel will understand that we wuz kangs.  With the emphasis on the “wuz”.

        Cogently argued essay.“It seems many in the West still think they can wish hard enough to change reality on the battlefield.”This is called “magical thinking.” It’s similar to what the Nazis were propagating to their hapless population in late 1944 and early 1945. Magical thinking — involving denial of basic realities — is what the sh!head neocon “policymakers” do in DC.With regard to how these loonies and the populations they preside over will cope with their sharp reduction in influence and economic well-being, I suspect many, perhaps most, will not move beyond the first stage of the “five stages of grief” — namely, denial. We usually call this madness.I apologise profusely but can’t help feeling some schadenfreude.

            A consideration. The current arrangement was built mostly by western ideology. The death of the west will cause a transition to something new and unknown.The direction will not likely be an improvement and the transition will also be unpredictable and brutal.For all of our faults we got a lot right before we were overcome by this new madness. The west may deserve the beating thats coming but that doesn’t mean it will be good for the rest of the planet. More losers than winners.The unstability caused by the decline of the west will spread like a plauge and cause an unknowable amount of decline around the world.

                WillS:  It was never our ‘job’ to see to the rest of the planet.  God did not appoint AINO to be the world’s policeman, nanny, chief cook and bottle washer.  Our government subsidized agriculture and do-gooder NGOs resulted in the massive and unsustainable growth of third-world populations, way beyond their carrying capacity.  Our open-borders and ‘equality’ insanity then assisted the movement of this excess population to over-run Europe, AINO, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
F*ck ‘the rest of the planet.”  We shouldn’t have meddled with it in the first place.

                    3gYou seem to have confused my comment with an endorsement of the bad policies of the US and the current policies. That was not my point.A weak west will be just as destructive to the west as it is to the rest. We are not the people or the country we were. We have been sold out by corperate America and we are rather dependent on the others to supply us with our meds and computer chips. We lack the ability to be independent, too many bad policies. I am disgusted with the stupidity and greed of the elite in AINO.When the west dies the modern civilization we have likely dies with it. I find no joy in celebrating the death of our advanced society.The open borders are one of the worst crimes commited against the American people. Maybe you have a solution that is viable and realistic.A stable world is good for everyone, including the DR.A strong America could say f☆☆k the rest of the planet. We haven’t been a strong country in 20+ years. We failed ourselves through bad policies and stupidity.

                Why the pessimism? While I’ve never had access to secret government contingency plans, I’m more optimistic: Except in the case where everybody literally set off every bomb on hand, it seems likely that much of the world would escape the worst radiation. Even the areas close to Ground Zero would become habitable given a few centuries. Of course, what the quality of the remaining DNA will be is an open question.Even if we somehow avoid opening up the canned sunshine, a worldwide system breakdown is no laughing matter. Again, I have no studies on hand, but I’d guess we’d be looking at a cull of a few billions, at the least. Yes, the middle ages might be the bottom we’d hit.

            I heard a reminiscent German discuss the later days of WWII.  He knew they were losing, and the where and how, simply by noting the “victories” the Wehrmacht were achieving city by city as those “victories” approached deeper and deeper into the country.  😉

        “How will the typical Frenchman react when he realizes he is a citizen of a pipsqueak country? How will the typical flag-waving American feel when he realizes he no longer lives in a superpower, but in a regional power that is in steep decline?”It is far worse than that. That France is puffing out its chest to fight for Ukraine when within its own borders it has surrendered sovereignty in select territories is a disgrace. How fun would it be to see one of Putin’s men pointing this out to some French girl boss at a negotiation?How will a Frenchmen feel when he realizes that his country and the land of his ancestors is no longer even his? How will he feel when he realizes that this is far more dire than when Rome ruled his ancestors with small occupying forces, but at least he outnumbered them?How will an American feel when he comes to the same realization, that not only does he not live in a superpower, but that his children live as a despised and legally disadvantaged minority on a continent that was his just forty years ago.The awakenings won’t be rude, they will be savage.

Well said.
Not much point in being a superpower when you daughter idolises Tyrone and your son thinks both he and his father have made use of ‘unearned white privilege’.

            “How will the typical flag-waving American feel when he realizes he no longer lives in a superpower, but in a regional power that is in steep decline?”We shouldn’t credit Normie with too much self-awareness. Following a disastrous retreat from *twenty years* of fuck-fuck games in Afghanistan against a fourth-rate power, one might think the feeling of steep decline would have descended upon his mind. Instead, it seems largely forgotten and Normie is on the couch. Certainly the agitprop business (the media) acts blissfully ignorant of the disaster. What could easily happen after Weekend At Bernie’s II begins in January 2025 is Ukraine drops entirely from agitprop and Normie consciousness, just like Afghanistan. Next war: destination Taiwan.

                Normie’s lack of self-awareness is undeniable after Covid and the subsequent memory-holing of the lies and outrages associated with it. A dog that has been kicked once has more understanding of reality.

            At least the French have the likes of Eric Zemmour and Marion Marechal calling it out, and they haven’t been silenced (yet). Read Zemmour’s latest book and you’ll see that France’s elites are well aware of the s**tshow they’ve created – but they will only admit the truth to Zemmour privately, not in public on TV.Maybe Zemmour hasn’t been silenced because he still has personal connections and old friendships with much of the French establishment dating from before he was the current enfant terriible.  There’s an interesting anecdote in his book where he is hauled into the police station by apologetic cops due to some “hate speech” accusation, and they all want selfies with him!

            Considering that such a reversal will also come with financial turmoil as well, it will be quite “rude.” It may take a lot to dethrone the dollar (which underpins our custom of living), but when it happens, all bets are off.

            The secondary ethnic Neocon dream is to make Europeans kill other  Europeans. If France sends troops to Ukraine, and other White countries join in, it will be a great bonus for them. White men dying in the east while their home countries are filled with more and more diversity.

                We went through such an “experiment” in Korea with all Black divisions.  Such was a failure, hence integration of the service.  Nothing to due with Civil Rights, everything to do with performance.  With the exception of Hispanics—to an extent—our minority majority armed forces will not cut it on the battlefield.
