        Correcting the record is not just an exercise in trivial exactitude. It is about re-centering a people on the foundation of their past so they can once again reach for the stars.This may sound campy but I often think of this stuff when I‚Äôm out walking my dog and look up at the stars. You can actually see them most nights in Oregon during the summer. I used to think it was inevitable that one day people would live out there among those suns. Nowadays I look up and just think, no, the future will likely just be a handful of shit and sand right here on earth.It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine what could possibly motivate the millenials and zoomers in their quests for ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù and ‚Äúequity‚Äù. Starships would beextremelydifficult to build but are certainly within the realm of the physically possible. The young wokists‚Äô utopia has been imagined before and tried before though using slightly different words. When Whites tried it, the result was grim, joyless totalitarianism. When PoC tried it, as in Venezuela today, the result is vast slums full of ‚Äì well full of sand and shit.

Some combination of boredom, self loathing and frustration over falling short of their expectations.

                I can‚Äôt really blame them. A bunch of people who aren‚Äôt your people off on a vanity project while your family rots in poverty would piss me off too.And note while people like to make envy out to be a sin, normal human societies they kind we spent 90% of our evolved life in had a basic degree of equality,. You and your tribe suffered together  and while big men got more,   they earned it and frankly the more had to be shared anyway to buy status.The current situation is untenable for that reason and when people have enough of it, you get SA right now . Sure you starve when Y/T infrastructure gets destroyed  but in that case  everyone starves which is on a psychological level  better for a lot of people of all races.

While the South Africa civil disorder continues apace, here‚Äôs a wry report from Daily Mail. Jailed leader‚Äôs son asks followers to ‚ÄúPlease protest and loot responsibly.‚Äù Good to see that a bit of that dry British wit remains, as well as at least a glimmer of propriety. (Damn! I‚Äôve been reading too much Derbyshire! üòÄ )

        If able to stomach it, review the latest offering from a Harvard educated Sophist who at one point, compares himself to Sarah Conner from the Terminator franchise‚Ä¶https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/voting-rights-black-heroes/Getting past all of the rhetoric of the opinion piece reveals what it all comes down to: Power. Stolen elections are conspiracy, unless it pertains to someone like Stacey Abrams. All history is re-imagined as if Wakanda would be real if America hadn‚Äôt been such a meanie for no reason whatsoever.The future they envision is not equality or absolution of grievances,  but to merely hold the whip and repeat the scenes currently in South Africa.

            Once a parasite seizes power over the host, the bloodsucking escalates until the host is bled dry &amp; dies. As such, we are on a collision course with collapse and it‚Äôs best to develop a contingency plan for this outcome. Do you really want to be in a big city when the rioting goes berserk and roving gangs run wild? Do you have a safe haven where you can retreat and protect yourself &amp; family? And you cannot eat lamentation &amp; I-told-you-so, so best get busy now.

        The thing that gets me, is that after civil rights, shouldn‚Äôt the country be more happy? If segregation was so evil, that would reflect in our manners and crime and behavior.
But its been the opposite. ‚ÄúDeath Wish‚Äù and Dirty Harry weren‚Äôt popular becasue things were good.
Incidently, I remember seeing a ‚ÄúEnd Apatite‚Äù in a BIll Murry movie, I think it was Scrooged.

            I‚Äôm sure the AWs would say we‚Äôre unhappy because we‚Äôre still segregated, albeit informally rather than juridically. If we could just force da ebel whi suprimiss to include the saintly African-Americans, all would be well.

            Trumpism is not becoming fascist, of course. That‚Äôs just nonsensical rhetoric designed to whip the flames of AW. However, if fascism‚Äìas opposed to Nazism‚Äìis required to prevent white genocide and preserve Western civilization, sign me up.

                    Why do you people continue to insist on allowing the enemy to create the vocabulary &amp; grammar upon which foundation the discourse will proceed?
Until you create your own vocabulary &amp; grammar, you are merely intellectual [&amp; much more importantly, PSYCHOLOGICAL] slaves of the parasites which spend every waking hour of their parasitic lives inventing new &amp; ever moar seductive vocabularies &amp; grammars for you to regurgitate dutifully.

        Two questions(maybe obvious for American people, please forgive me for that)
1-Did Lincoln really wanted to expulse every black in Africa?
2- (about ‚ÄúRIGHT-wing liberals‚Äù) : was the republican party, in 1860, considered already as a rightist party, and dem party as a left wing party?
(if not, when did the rep party moved from the left to the right?)

            ‚Ä¶was the republican party, in 1860, considered already as a rightist party, and dem party as a left wing party?Depends on how you define right a d left.The Republican Party was created in 1856 as an explicitly abolitionist and anti- polygamist party.   Does that sound right wing or left wing today?What it was not was  traditionalist or conservative.  It also was not advocating a small government.  It wanted a more robust federal government to reform society by eliminating the above mentioned cultural factors.  Does that sound like a right wing or a left wing political agenda today.It‚Äôs also mostly forgotten now that their opponents called themthe Radical republicansa label that many of them embraced.

            Any political party which abandoned the original constitution and based its raison d‚Äôetre on a sentence in the Declaration of Independence, basically a declaration of war sent to the King of England, that party would have to be considered not only radical but revolutionary. Furthermore, any political party which would justify massive bloodshed in order to further its goals would also have to be considered fanatical.

        For Lincoln‚Äî and for virtually every other White man at the time who favored freeing the Black slaves‚Äî an indispensable correlate to Emancipation was Repatriation: sending the freed slaves either back to Africa, or to some other far off locale. None of them imagined the full equality and integration into American society that today‚Äôs liberals take for granted. None of them were under the illusion that that could possibly work.

            You should avoid attributing our enemy‚Äôs actions to stupidity when malice is more fitting. John Brown and his ilk not only wanted full equality, they wanted ‚Äúinvoluntary miscegenation‚Äù to genetically eradicate the Southern nation, followed by black supremacy.  The primary plan for a good subset of Yankees (‚Äúradical abolitionists‚Äù) was for the blacks to rise up and go full on Haiti/Angola/Zimbabwe on the White Southrens.  That was the original intent of Lincoln‚Äôs emancipation proclamation.The Morganthau plan for the South, as it were.Again, they hate us and want us dead, and have for centuries.

As I have said in these parts recently, all of classical American History, from circa 1750 to 1900*, was just one long century and a half replay of Culloden, war after war after war.
*When the Frankfurt School seized control of the ship of state.

                Poor Whites == the losers at Culloden.
Rich Whites == the winners of Culloden.
[The rich Whites weren‚Äôt actually AT Culloden; they sent their hannoverian scabs to do their fighting for them. You see the same pattern in Culloden IV, the war of 1861-1865, when, once again, the rich Whites cheated and imported myriad taters &amp; lutherans &amp; jews to do their fighting for them.]

        Whatever Jefferson may have been up to with his words in the Declaration‚Äî about all men being created equal‚Äî many other things he wrote reveal him as a race realist who could not possibly have been intending or imagining full civic equality for Blacks.‚ÄúNothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them‚Ä¶.. Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid: and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous.‚Äù‚Äî- from his 1805 ‚ÄòNotes on the State of Virginia‚ÄôSo whatever realm of equality he was referring to in the Declaration, it clearly wasn‚Äôt equality in the sense modern liberals use it. Jefferson clearly had no desire or intention to include Blacks in the America he was envisioning.Likewise Lincoln: he had no illusions about Blacks being equal, or playing an equal part in American life:‚ÄúI am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be a position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.‚Äù‚Äî-18 September, 1858, In his debate with Stephan DouglasSo the notion that the ‚Äúequality of all men‚Äù the Declaration spoke of was full civic equality‚Äî or that the Civil War was fought to promote American Blacks to such equality‚Äî is clearly fallacious.The only people those notions could be foisted on, are those who know nothing about Jefferson and Lincoln.

            The Declaration was written for a specific problem that could not be resolved except by Independence and war to break from England.The problem being dreadful misgovernance all round.Below is the beginning, the Founders explained WHY they had to separate from England.Why British government had become unbearable (and it was incompetence from afar).‚ÄúWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature‚Äôs God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.‚ÄúI‚Äôm quite certain they regretted the next words of all men being created equal.  We all certainly have since.In any case it‚Äôs mooted, that government fell in January at the hands of the elites and we may consider ourselves Free of at least those chains at last.Now do as you will, just as they do as they will.  Let the strongest rule, and not by words, but force, for it is far easier to submit to a tyranny that earned it as opposed to the coward swindlers we have now.  It is easier to kneel to a blood stained warlord then a nigger, don‚Äôt you think?

        If I might be permitted a very small, very limited defense of my former profession, it‚Äôs not so much that professional historians are rabid ideologues, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre incredibly sheltered, incredibly naive, and not nearly as smart as they think they are (I told you this would be a verylimiteddefense).Assume that you were hired to write ‚ÄúAn Introduction to the Japanese‚Äù for some reason. But you don‚Äôt speak Japanese, have never been to Japan, and your internet is so inconsistent that all you‚Äôve got to work with is a few old anime videos and the collected novels of James Clavell.That‚Äôsthe situation facing most professional historians, vis-a-vis actual human behavior.For one thing, academia is a guild profession now ‚Äî has been for a long time ‚Äî and so your average professor is quite often the child, and even the grandchild, of professors. They quite literally grew up on campus. For another, real world experience on your resume actually counts against you when you‚Äôre applying for grad schools, and if you do manage to get it with some dreaded private sector stuff on there, you can kiss your social life goodbye ‚Äî you might only be a few years older, chronologically, but you‚Äôll be lifetimes apart from your classmates (I speak from experience here). Finally, here is a comprehensive list of the graduate coursework I was required to take in economics, statistics, agronomy, and things military:See what I mean? If history is supposed to be an analysis of ‚Äúwhat people be like,‚Äù as one of my most entertaining former students once put it on the term paper, then you‚Äôd think that the three F‚Äôs ‚Äî that‚Äôs Farming, Fighting, and Fornication ‚Äî would feature prominently in the educations of prospective historians‚Ä¶ but they don‚Äôt. You‚Äôd think basic stats would be on there ‚Äî hell, you‚Äôd think basicmathwould be on there ‚Äî but I got into a pretty decent grad school without even taking the math portion of the GRE.All of which is to say that it‚Äôs not surprising that eggheads fall for Derb‚Äôs ‚Äúchallenging systems of thought that contain no truth.‚Äù They don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know, and their entire lives ‚Äî starting, in many cases, with their grandparents ‚Äî is designed to keep them from ever finding out.

                This is of course not to diminish the role of ideology ‚Äì lots of them *are* rabid ideologues, and even the ones that aren‚Äôt rabid are far Left.

            You came up through the ranks after I did, Severian. When I took the GRE‚Äì1994 and 1995‚Äìthe quantitative portion was still very much a requirement. But what you mention is just further proof of dumbing down in academia. Not so very long ago a relatively high baseline of intelligence was required to obtain a Ph.D. and to become a professor. No more. The professoriate has always had more than its fair share of fools, of course. Now, alas, it is becoming inundated with idiots, to boot.PS‚ÄìI was recently speaking to a history prof who was my informal mentor when I was an undergrad. He told me that in the history department where he works‚Äìand from which I gook my bachelor‚Äôs‚Äìcomprehensive exams are no longer required to qualify for writing the dissertation because, ‚ÄúNobody needs to memorize all that stuff, anymore. You can just find it on the Internet.‚Äù I almost vomited on the spot.

        I‚Äôm working my way through Plato now. It‚Äôll take a long time. However, rhetoric and sophistry frequently make their appearance. Rhetoricians were clever orators who were skilled at persuasion but light on content (ie., politicians); Sophists were cunning and specious debaters, what we‚Äôd call ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù today.Clearly, this skills and others are helpful in re-writing the past. Whoever said ‚ÄúThe winners write history‚Äù was only partially correct. It‚Äôs those who keep the archives, and update it to suit current policy, who control the past. The Winston Smiths, if you like. When the Idealists are in control, whether they were the Council of Nicea in 325 AD, the Communists of the 20th century, the Warren Commission, indeed nearly any politically-motivated group of any time, their goal is to whitewash and airbrush the past until it suits their fancies. Then, surely, current reality, or at least perceptions, will fall in line with the desired party line, the Five Year Plan.

            Slightly off topic here but I‚Äôve been trying to read more of ‚Äúthe Classics‚Äù that educated men would have been made to study. I‚Äôm not just looking for a list of books but any convincing arguments as to whether to read online, hardcopy, audio-book, brain implant chip (just kidding).  I‚Äôll also consider non-Western stuff. Right before the Coof Panic shut down my gym I was listening to The Art of War (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZnHA-e73A) while on the treadmill. Plato is an obvious pick but a lot of the modern lists of classics are compiled by wokists whose entire point is ‚Äúlook how awful White Western culture is‚Äù.  So what have all you DR types been reading?

                The internet is your friend. In the first place, virtually all of ‚Äúthe Classics‚Äù are public domain (unless a recent edition, clearly). That means you can get an ebook version or (less available) audio book. Archive.org, gutenberg.org, and librivox.org are my go-to places. If you use a Bittorrent client, there are plenty of similar public domain collections available, including from the above sites.Naturally your local library should have some. I‚Äôm not even opposed to printed books, but I hope you will be able to avoid fattening the wallet of Amazon and their globohomo partners-in-exploitation.What to read? There‚Äôs probably more available than one could read in a thousand lifetimes. I would suggest searching for a list of ‚ÄúClassic Literature‚Äù or such, that will let you fine-tune your choices. I‚Äôve found that reading some criticism (usu. academic stuff) on a particular author is helpful (sometimes this is even included in a collection). If time is limited (isn‚Äôt it always?), you might try to read the best works representative of major authors, or time periods, or nations, etc. For example, Plato left a lot of books, but the best may be ‚ÄúThe Republic‚ÄùI wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about ‚Äúwoke‚Äù revisions. I‚Äôve heard this can happen, but the danger is probably limited. All the better to read a pdf image of a century-old text,  to protect from that. I find specific ebook versions easier to read, but my reader handles both. Or you can read them on your PC.

        Z, thank you for this clarification of the Dissident Project.‚Äú At the core, the dissident project is about peeling back the layers of lies and fabrications like second founding theory. History is a story of a people and our story has been rewritten by strangers who see us as enemies. Correcting the record is not just an exercise in trivial exactitude. It is about re-centering a people on the foundation of their past so they can once again reach for the stars. If the folks at the Bulwark want to know ‚Äúwhat they hell is happening‚Äù there is the answer in a nutshell.‚ÄùHow does this change anything?Politics is the problem, politics is Power.  Recentering the People now conquered and marked for cultural genocide openly and probably actual genocide as policy ‚Äì recenter them to do what?   Get power? How?And I must say I think things have changed.  I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll march or even rally to an idea.  I think the age of ideas has passed, the age of raw power has begun.And do you know, the Republic has fallen- and look who sits on its grave?And other men look and say if they can do that why not I?And my dears they may be hiring , and not hiring pens, but the other.When the Roman Republic fell Warlords took the Empire.  This will be different? Where Cicero failed, Claremont or Taki will succeed?Ideas are dead.Power lives again.

            Yes, but the exercise of power does not have to include the slaughter of innocents. There is a better way. Power should be used sparingly and be highly focused on the root of the problem. As Z has pointed out in recent posts &amp; podcasts, the disease models as an emergent behavior like that found in bird flocks and fish schools. You just need to focus on a few cells and the rest will follow en masse.

        My beef with Jaffa is the whole idea that Lincoln was consciously trying to reforge the American Union.Everything he did during the war suggests a desperate, improvisational quality to each and every act.  He knew his mandate for the presidency was slim and his actions against the copperheads and other southern sympathizers suggest he was well aware that he was staying in power on a wing and a prayer.  All indications for postwar policy point to him taking the ex-slaves and shipping them somewhere far away from the shores of the US.Point being, he was far too busy running a war to have the time to conduct abstruse political theorizing on what the United States of American was all about.  Anecdotally, it appears he didn‚Äôt even think the GA went over that well with the audience.  In all likelihood, to Lincoln, it was just another re-election speech.

            Yes. The excellent book on the Civil War period ‚ÄúThe Fall of the House of Dixie‚Äù does a very good job of outlining the incremental, improvisational quality of Lincoln‚Äôs presidency. The amount of revisionist history around Lincoln just fills an ideological need among the Left and retconners.

            Basil;Agreed.  Lincoln was neither the messianic figure of Jaffa, et al, nor was he the satanic villain as portrayed by some. Just to begin with, he was *not* a New England Abolitionist absolutist.  His 1860 platform was ‚ÄòFree Soil* and Union‚Äô, *not* freeing the slaves, per se.  After the war began, as you say, he was, first of all, mostly just trying to hold his coalition together.  He was very open about this.  As evidence, here‚Äôs a link to his famous letter to abolitionist Horace Greeley.http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htmThe money quote: ‚ÄúMy paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.‚Äù*Free Soil = White small farmers (and about 70% of the pop. at that time worked in agriculture and related) not wanting to have to compete with plantation-based, slave-labor agriculture, particularly in the newly opened Western Territories.

                What Western Territories were slaves going to be working in? Neither the terrain nor the climate were suitable for the kinds of cash crops that would make chattel slavery profitable. Beyond a fringe of southeastern Kansas, there was really nowhere a planter could go and make money from slave labor. By the time of the troubles in Kansas, Cyrus McCormick had already invented the threshing machine. There may have been a possibility of introducing slavery to the irrigated lands of the Southwest, but by the time those areas were being settled and irrigations systems buit, machines were replacing human labor and no thinking person, assuming slavery had survived into the 1880s, would have risked trying to set up a plantation system in those areas at that time. In other words, the Dred Scot case was a purely political ploy to isolate slaveholders and focus enmity against them by stirring up fears which were largely non-existent. Trying to imagine slave plantations in Nebraska is ludicrous. The purpose of the Kansas-Nebraska act was to drive a wedge between North and South and stir up irrational emotions. It succeeded wildly.

                    Epi;All of what you said is mostly true.  But it is also mostly irrelevant to the world of 1856 US politics when the Republican Party was formed.  There was very little common knowledge about agricultural conditions W of the Mississippi at that time.  Besides this, there was no shortage of lying hucksters extolling ‚Äòthe bountiful West‚Äô. Those hucksters were trying to induce gullible settlers to migrate W in order to make their own land speculations pay off.Who can predict future inventions and their commercial success today_?  Why would that situation not apply to the world of 1856_?In 1856 an extrapolation of the recent past made the spread of plantation agriculture seem a likely threat to free labor.  No more than 10 years prior, plantations had spread to Arkansas and Texas, after all.While we can‚Äôt know precisely what Lincoln‚Äôs supporters thought in the 1860 election, we can know what they wrote at the time.  It was almost nothing like what Jaffa et al, *or* Lincoln demonizers say now.

        Integral to the idea of a ‚Äúproposition nation‚Äù, a nation of ideas, is the religious foundation of the people writing the story.
One people can see their God.  He looks like them, has a name, and once walked amongst them, as one of them.
Another people cannot.  He has no name, no face, and can be anything.
Now, which story is more likely to rooted in blood and soil reality, versus anything our imagination needs it to be at the moment?

        Christopher Caldwell had the opportunity to step up to the plate as Claremont‚Äôs most influential member, with his latest book, ‚ÄúThe Age of Entitlement‚Äù. It‚Äôs probably the most important book this century and it clearly shows how the post 1965 State itself was altered to act as both carrot and stick for enforcing the DIE agenda (and all its offshoots, present and future). Caldwell does successfully put everything onto paper, but he stops shy of connecting the dots. Inferring what can and must be done is left to the reader.Zman, a couple of months ago, you cited a talk between Caldwell and Andrew Sullivan (on Sullivan‚Äôs podcast I believe). In any case, Caldwell immediately set aside his entire ouevre he had carefully labored over for years in favor of yukking it up and swapping ole Harvard memories with Sullivan to remind Sullivan‚Äôs audience of his bona fides as a paid up member of the ruling bureaucratic elite ‚Ä¶ no pesky talk about what State mechanisms have been put into place since 1965 (and abused in overdrive by the Obama Admin). There was no time left over by the time these two were done snapping each other‚Äôs suspenders. Caldwell still has one foot in both camps, much like J D Vance, and Murray. It‚Äôs the best these 3 can do until things further deteriorate.  New leaders will emerge with time,

                I‚Äôve found that the way to cut the legs out from under both Progs and their (((kindred spirits))) is to tell them ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pagan‚ÄùThey have no answer for it and can‚Äôt even begin to think on how to use it against you.  It also helps that I am being serious.  I mean, I see a lot of wisdom in the old folkways, and if I am any ‚Äúist‚Äù it would be a naturalist, and that goes hand in glove with a pagan.   And when I tell them quite seriously that I am part wolf and part dolphin, they almost want to cry because their brains start to short circuit.Incidentally, I was a bit stunned, as if I were dreaming of hearing myself, when Novak Djokovic recounted his childhood story about seeing wolves in the forest by his home, and how it deeply affected him when they gave him a stare and communicated something to him. A person will have to have experienced it or then it just seems like b.s.  I was also attacked by a hybrid wolf-malamute as a kid, and I swear it turned me into a little wolf boy.  It does change you.  Gives you an animal spirit.  I can attest to it.Again, these old folk stories have a lot of truth to them.  The wolfman story, for example.  A lot of guys used to always identify with animals.  Hawks.  Wolves.  Whatever happened?  Now they identify with fairies and  unicorns.We lost touch with a primal part of ourselves perhaps.  I am glad I haven‚Äôt.Grrrrrrrr !!!!

            Yes, I just finished ‚ÄúAge of Entitlement.‚Äù I get the same idea of Caldwell. While overall I think his arguments in the book are firmly in the DR camp, he clearly throws in a few sops to modern (Liberal, Zionist, whatever) sensibilities. For example, in his critique of the Eugenics movement of a century or more ago (in fairness he covers both sides of that volatile issue) he mentions how the evil strict immigration laws of the USA (1920s onward) forbade the U.S. consulate to let in the flow of Jews and other refugees who needed asylum in the years leading up to WW II. Implicitly, the USA (and Whites) are guilty in retrospect. Scant mention of whether the host nation even had the right to decide who is admitted and who stays out. Presumably, it is the moral responsibility of the safe countries to admit, without limit, anyone with a sob story, real or imagined, without regard to what benefits or costs these immigrants bring. At the least, I supposed the West is atoning for the sins of generations ago. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work out for our benefit, however. üôÅ

            Guys like Caldwell and Charles Murray can‚Äôt quite connect the dots because it‚Äôs too big a leap for them.

        I‚Äôm familiar with Larry Arne.  He has that Hillsdale scam where he rakes in a million a year as the chief priest of the Lincoln cult.  One thing that jumped out at me was remembering   an old Pat Buchanan saying that the Declaration of Independence was actually the birth certificate of a nation already born in the hearts of men of a certain culture and ethnicity.  I think that says it pretty succinctly.  These ‚Äúfounding documents‚Äù are mere outcroppings of something that was designed to produce them.  A rose bush creates a rose.  By replacing a nation of European whites with other people, we‚Äôre ripping out the rose bush, planting cacti, and still expecting roses to bloom.  They won‚Äôt be coming back.

        ‚ÄòIn a slightly different context, John Derbyshire noted that some people have an unnatural skill at creating ‚Äúelaborate, plausible, and intellectually very challenging systems that do not, in fact, have any truth content‚Äù.‚ÄôI actually do believe that some, SOME, historians in the past have been RELATIVELY honest and followed the evidence wherever it led. I was raised on Will Durant‚Äôs History of Civilization and The Lessons of History. I know he had many preconceptions, but overall, he was a RELATIVELY honest and ethical historian of ‚Äúthe big picture.‚Äù However, today‚Äôs historians that make a living out of telling people about the past are merely barely literate court historians that will write whatever they‚Äôre told to write, in their ‚Äúown style‚Äù, of course, regardless of how ridiculous it is.  The 1619 Project is a good example, as is the concept that White people are responsible for and continue to cause the failures of other races (one race in particular), even though White people as a group are no longer in charge of anything. Except paying for everything and preventing society from collapsing.

            Excellent point. Let‚Äôs hope that South Africa is successful in exiling or otherwise destroying the remaining non-indigenous people, who clearly have been the source of the centuries of misery that continent has suffered, up to and including the current riots, looting, injuries and deaths.

            Edward Gibbon was the best historical writer, ever.  Period.
Knew gods how many languages.  Published an epic work that is still examined 400 years later.  Influential in politics and as a writer.

        Obviously there is some value in educating others about current events and the malefactors publishing literary insanity on the internet media pages. But that education only has usefulness if you believe that we are going to talk our way out of the mess we‚Äôre in. In theory, this new insight would enable you to more effectively persuade others that The Bad Guys are totally wrong and, voila, the light bulb goes off, everyone change their minds and miraculously become sane.The problem with this is that natural selection has been extinct for a few millennia now and DNA pollution is making sanity a rarity in our population. Talking won‚Äôt fix DNA-based stupid. Imagine being in a medieval melee where everyone is swing long swords wildly and you‚Äôre the only one in the group trying to calm everyone down with your soothing words. Whose DNA is going to survive that contest?

        I remember an article in the National Review, early 1981, when MLK‚Äôs birthday was formalized as a national holiday. I recall it cautioning against what was the right‚Äôs wholesale embrace of MLK, even though many of his philosophies were opposed to conservative principles. It‚Äôs been amusing over the years observing conservative commentators just assuming that MLK would be a supporter of free market capitalism, anti-affirmative action, etc. I believe they had this vision that if MLK had survived, he‚Äôd be marching arm-in-arm with Ward Connerly (black activist who fought affirmative action in California in the 80s) in protest of minority quotas.LOL.

            It is an open question how many Conservatism, Inc. hacks understand the truth about MLK but lie about him and how many truly believe the myths that have been created about him.  The younger ones clearly believe the myths.  I wonder how many current writers for National Review have read much of the archives and how they reconcile what was written then with what the magazine‚Äôs editors write today.  I remember how pissed Jim Geraghty was when at some point during the 2016 Presidential primary cycle, several of us in the comments started comparing them to the Washington Generals.  He came off like a true believer, dumb enough to think MLK just wanted everyone to be treated equally and not take it any farther.  This is why the quality of the writing at National Review has declined so rapidly.  They have had to find people dumb enough not to connect the dots.

        The paid buffoon shills at the Bulwark aside, it‚Äôs really remarkable how far to the Left ConInc has moved in the last ten years. I mean, with regard to the Claremont attack, there is nothing that the Claremont Institute believes in, as cited in the attack piece, that William Buckley or Russell Kirk, supposedly the founders of movement conservatism, would have disagreed with  ‚Äì Hell, Jonah Frickin Goldberg would have agreed with 95% of it ten years ago. The move left has been relentless, and fast, and it started before Trump.It sounds odd, but I believe that the collapse of ConInc resistance to gay marriage was the turning point. In many ways the collapse reminds me of what happened to the ARVN in South Vietnam in 1975 ‚Äì what was conceived by top leadership as a strategic withdrawal from an untenable position turned into a rout, because once they started retreating, there was no obvious place to stop. Ditto ConInc on sodomite marriage ‚Äì I mean, if you‚Äôre not going to conserve something that has been part of Western Civilization since long before Christ, what‚Äôs the point?  The gay marriage issue looked minor at the time, one of those things that only square God-botherers cared about, but, like the Central Highlands in Vietnam, it turned out to be a lot more important  than anyone thought.

Hell‚Äôs bells ‚Äì we have the library of Alexandria at our fingertips, everything is only a click of the mouse away!There should be a million Z men. There should be tens of millions of dissidents.

            I think you‚Äôre right. That‚Äôs why there is such a great market for these ‚Äòchallenging‚Äô lies, particularly in the middle classes. People who have never lifted a finger to learn the basics about groundwater, how to sharpen a knife, or how clouds are formed just want you to know how knowledgeable they are. I see it all the time.The important thing is to be seen believing, and also heard divulging, such challenging lies. People‚Äôs beliefs tend to come and go out of fashion like clothes. Covid is a good modern example. This is why it is important to think for yourself. But also, more importantly, to recognise what is actually of consequence to you, personally. This gives you the freedom to tell people that ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt give two hoots about climate change and gay rights‚Äù‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt your problem. And if they are problems at all, they are secondary, tertiary, quaternary &amp;c.The same people believing these ‚Äòchallenging‚Äô lies are the ones who watch poncy art movies and look down, in quite obvious fashion, on Arnie and co. laying down lead on the Predator with a minigun.

I once asked on here if any people had so fully embraced modernity as Jews. Somebody replied that, no, they‚Äôd created it, which I thought was a stretch. But by the day it seems I discover another influential Jewish figure!  And of course, less notable gentile figures whose thinking I often find myself agreeing with.

        This process of rewriting the historical record leads to some peculiar outcomes, especially when the new narrative is involved.Robert E. Lee is the foreshadowing of 20th century Hilter according to the updated version. However, if it is pointed out to a Progressive-Leftist that Lincoln asked a Southern slave owning Virginian to lead the Northern army to bring the states back into the fold, a blank stare or confusion settles across their face.Pointing out that the Emancipation Proclamation had zero effect on the status of slaves in the Union states that didn‚Äôt secede is futile as well.Today‚Äôs knowledge and understanding of our nation‚Äôs history for most people reminds me of the old Tonight Show bit Jaywalking, where Jay Leno would ask simple 5th grade level questions to people outside the studio. It used to be funny how ignorant they were. It‚Äôs not funny anymore. People who forget their past usually forfeit their future.

        The Civil War, however, was not a continuation of a cultural dispute dating back to the English Civil War‚Ä¶.It was absolutely. As was the American Revolution itself. For many centuries royalty, kings in particular, stood between the aristocracy and the commoners, looking out for the interests of the general population and the country itself. They sometimes misconceived their role and at other times failed while accepting it but nevertheless their duty it was.The failure of Cromwell‚Äôs Puritan regime in the UK meant that it could only survive in the New World, which it did. New England Puritan thought was the basis of the revolution and continued in the struggle between the northern states and the south. Just as Cromwell‚Äôs Parliamentarians demanded control of the entire UK, including Ireland and Scotland, the Puritans wanted control over the south and implementation of ‚Äúmanifest destiny‚Äù over a country and people of which they had only the scantiest knowledge. In this case Lincoln was the reincarnation of Oliver Cromwell himself.While Cromwell is today a bad memory in the UK that survives in the minds of many, Lincoln has been portrayed as a heroic American figure. If any history needs re-writing in a more objective and realistic manner it is that of the founding of the US and the immense damage done to the country by the maniacal Lincoln, who could have purchased and freed every slave in the country but preferred to kill their owners instead.

            I think it was Hoffer that noted the Roundheads ranks were swollen by urban poor who had been pushed off the land by the enclosures.   And that the roundheads would not have been triumphant without that element.
So in a way, that was another fallout of the Norman conquest and their dispossession of the native English.

            Superb.  Very interesting is the idea that ‚Äúroyalty, kings in particular, stood between the aristocracy and the commoners‚Äù.That places them in the middle, as a limiting factor, not the top, as a State tyrant.  Thus, constitutional monarchies for the modern, literate age.Note that in the ancient empires, emperors were the middlemen between the gods above and the people below.   Pretty much every empire styled itself as a kingdom of Heaven, with the emperor divine, legitimately representing his people to the gods.A limiting factor, the Face of a national family with sanctioned authority. If that face of the family is lost, we end up with the muddy fusion of State and Corporate, sparking a religious war of legitimacy between the power factions of military (State), administrative (Preisthood), and owner (Corporate).

                Did not Cromwell and his Puritans bring Democracy to the Colonies?
Jaffa gave us Lord Protector Lincoln, just as his people, wanting back into Albion, brought up Cromwell and the corrupt Parliamentarian aristocracy.
Of course the story is revised by the priesthood to justify the victory, and excuse the bloodshed.
The question now is a King, or even a Lord Protector, possible in a multicultural democracy?

                To put a finer point on it, I‚Äôm not sure whether or not you‚Äôre implying the Puritans played the aristocratic role.

        The main characteristic of the Left/Prog restaurant is that there is an intellectual dish for all tastes. The revisionist History stuff Zman discusses here is just one of the items on a big menu:For the Blacks: the 1619/CRT/reparations stewFor the alphabet soup: the right to show your junk in a day spa or marry your dogFor the guilty Whites: the ‚ÄúSecond Founding‚Äù souffle‚Äô, ‚ÄúEquity‚Äù omeletFor the Hispanic immigrants: welfare state tacosAnd finally, for the rest: just steak tartare ‚Äì the raw power of the State.The raw stuff attracts bureaucrats, the subcons, many Asians, the media and others who just worship the State. The nihilism inherent in this dish is no intellectual impediment to the Left. Ultimately, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs for dinner for everyone and you‚Äôll be forced to eat it and like it.

            The problem with having a large menu is that you need a large kitchen staff. I think of the bloated American university system and media as that kitchen. It grinds out all these different flavors of propaganda for all these different factions. This worked for a long time because they all saw Whitey as the common enemy. What we started to see in 2020 was a power struggle among all the different groups.Given that their ‚Äúideology‚Äù is a mass of contradictory impulses this could be very bloody indeed. You won‚Äôt see gangs of Pajeets and Jews having knife fights in grimy Brooklyn alleys but once you mix in Blacks, Hispanics, Laotians, Thais,.. Now the potential for violence is much higher. The problem is that the Big American Pie has been promised to many different groups. Some are accustomed to just taking theirs and killing the competition while others think the contest is decided with SAT scores and accounting tricks.

            Idly web surfing I ran across a web site dedicated to helping SA citizens emigrate to Australia.   Reading the open forum I thought there would be some good tidbits about why they were leaving.  Nothing in that forum. No mention of the elephant in the room.  Just a little talk of rising crime rates and bad schools.  Even those SA citizens leaving are good whites, probably supported Mandela but are leaving still for obvious reasons.  They just wont say it.   It‚Äôs infuriating.

                    Alzaebo ‚Äì it‚Äôs not the fear of the ANC bureaucrats but even more the fear of the Australian or New Zealand ones, who would be quick to refuse entry to any avowed raycist.  Plus, even once they‚Äôve escaped the South African hell, a lot of the emigres try to keep their heads down and fit in socially, and that involves the usual pieties about race.

            What I fear will happen is that White SA‚Äôs will be set upon by an aroused Black populous and before the world will declare a genocide in progress, their numbers will be reduced substantially.  The White SA‚Äôs are preparing to hold out under such attack in the hope of holding off extermination until an embarrassed world comes to their rescue.

                Pretty muchThe country was founded for pragmatic expansionary reasons, adventure, and  fairly pedestrian desires such as getting rich.  Or rather I‚Äôll rephrase it; not ‚Äúfounded‚Äù but ‚Äúdriven by.‚ÄùAnd that‚Äôs where the problems start imo.  Because society‚Äôs ‚Äúpriests‚Äù or the people who feel it their obligation to give some kind of mythological or religious context to this project have fixed on the puritanical themes.  Thus, it was not simply a bunch of guys coming here for whatever reason, but a ‚Äúfounding‚Äù borne of religiosity and  a moralistic enterprise.  That creates a massive disconnect between the reality of why people came here versus how this small little sect from New England tried to sell it.  And not only sell it, but craft it and conceive of it and infuse it with meaning.And it‚Äôs something that these priests won insofar as dominance over the culture.I said some time ago that while all the STEM guys were downplaying or laughing at all the Lib Arts people, the latter were busy doing their thing and remaking the nation in their image.  It‚Äôs our modern analog.  The STEM guys, the down to earth guys who make things and just want to make money and do stuff and raise families, very pragmatic and conventional of mind, versus the modern day priesthood I the form of lib arts majors.And the priests always seem to end up winning.  Boggles the mind that these people ultimately have more sway over the country than, say, the guys who went looking for gold, or oil, or land.  Or that the blue haired lib arts freak has more sway than the civil engineer.

            John Harrison, the man who effectively solved the longitude problem in ever greater increments with his sea-going clocks, H1, H2, H3 and H4, must surely be one of the greatest geniuses who ever lived. At the time, this problem was considered so difficult, that is it alleged even lifelong virgin, antagonistic bell-end, and part time theologian Sir Isaac Newton reasoned that it could not be done.I jest when I say those things about Newton, of course; but the point is Harrison‚Äôs undertaking was monumental, not just intellectually, but also from a practical standpoint. He was, if I recall, a carpenter. A carpenter who read as many works on classical mechanics as he could when younger. And he toiled for years. And his result? Well, it is no exaggeration to say it changed the direction of England‚Äôs trajectory, and really the World‚Äôs too.It meant we could get to brown countries far more easily to oppress locals, raise taxes. Of course, to my knowledge neither Newton nor Harrison were black. That said, the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, where Harrison‚Äôs clocks are now stored is surrounded by, ahem, ‚Äònew Englishmen of dusky hue‚Äô. Sad. Mind you, if Harrison‚Äôs invention allowed whites to travel yonder far more accurately, it also meant movement in the reverse direction; and PRESTO! 21st Century Greenwich.

        Pro history is a lot like pro wrestling. There are a few Heels,  a few Faces, and a whole bunch of Jobbers. The Faces get away with anything ‚Äì e.g. proven plagiarist Doris Kearns Goodwin, or Michael Bellesisles (still employed in academia). Their function is to push the narrative, and the Jobbers‚Äô job is to run with it‚Ä¶ which they are happy to do, for entirely mercenary reasons (only ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù ‚Äúresearch‚Äù gets published). Indeed, when I first started, decades ago, I was told that teaching is ‚Äúan inherently political act,‚Äù so go ahead and use your classroom as a soapbox.The good news in all of this is that it destroyed the profession‚Äôs integrity. Now it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù‚Ä¶ and the narratives are ludicrous, sloppy, and incoherent. When someone comes along with a nice new narrative (of the ‚Äù abductive reasoning ‚Äù sort), not only will the ‚Äúeducated‚Äù classes be unable to resist, they won‚Äôt even know where to start acquiring the tools. The whole structure is rotten; a gentle breeze could push it over.

            Goodwin and Bellesisles are when I started to think the ruling class was succumbing to its own incompetency. Goodwin‚Äôs book on baseball was so obviously fame that even the jock sniffers in sports radio mocked it. I recall hearing a couple of NYC sports guys rip the things to shreds. The gun book from Bellesisles was equally shoddy. IIRC, that won the Bancroft award. It was laughable nonsense on its face, but no one inside the hothouse noticed it.
The old line about not getting high off your own supply comes to mind.

                Did Doris Kearns Goodwin have sex with LBJ during her days ‚Äòon the ranch‚Äô? The guy slept with everything that moved, and that category would include a women as homely as young Doris. Maybe she can speak on this?
Caro books be damned, hers has the subtitle, ‚ÄúThe Most Revealing‚Ä¶ Ever‚Äù in it. Caro a foppish TDS sufferer, yes, but still authored the multi-volume bio that I would, since I read them all, put ahead of Ms. Goodwin‚Äôs weak sauce, which I also read part of.

                It did indeed win the Bancroft (which is basically the Nobel Prize of American History, for those who don‚Äôt know the arcana). I don‚Äôt have the link to hand, but the whole saga started because an amateur, a lawyer, started digging into it. Nobody in the biz could be bothered, even though situations of that sort ‚Äî ‚Äúthis one record group that explicitly says exactly what I need it to, that no one has ever heard of before‚Äù ‚Äî are *always* bullshit (Bellesisles wasn‚Äôt the only one who ever tried it, by a long shot).

                    I don‚Äôt know if it was the case with Bellesisles, but with Goodwin, it was assistants who wrote the books. She had a staff who did the research and put most of it together. She was, at best, the senior editor of her books. It is easy to see how this can go wrong. ‚ÄúThe boss wants sources to backup this point, so let me find her the sources.‚ÄùThe thing with Goodwin that always got me is that she was such an obvious phony. Her baseball book was as fake as a three dollar bill, but no one in that class knows anything about sports or sports fans, so no one noticed. She basically read all of George Will‚Äôs baseball columns and manufactured memories based off of them and a baseball reference. Of course, Will was a ridiculous phony as well.

                        @JackBonifce,google up ‚ÄúMichael Bellesisles today‚Äù and find out what a censure by the history profession is worth. The fact that I‚Äôm about to quote from a New York Times article about his rehabilitation should give you an indication:‚ÄúMr. Bellesiles, who has been teaching history part time at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain while working two other part-time jobs, did precisely what he had hoped to avoid: revive the controversy about ‚ÄúArming America.‚Äù Then, in June, an article he wrote for The Chronicle of Higher Education about teaching students military history during wartime stoked further discussion of Mr. Bellesiles‚Äôs credibility. In it he mentioned a student who told him a brother had been killed in Iraq ‚Äî a claim that turned out to be false. The Chronicle, which investigated the incident after readers raised questions, said the student confessed he had lied to Mr. Bellesiles.‚Äù&lt;/blockquoteStill employed in academia. Still writing articles for trade publications. Hell, he even has a new book out‚Ä¶ which is getting attention in the New York Times. Oh, how he suffered! Central Connecticut State ain&#x27;t Emory, I&#x27;ll grant you, but the only job this guy should&#x27;ve ever been able to get near college kids was &quot;night shift clerk at the campus Kwik-E-Mart.&quot;The guild always protects its own.

                            This failure to maintain standards is universal across the managerial class. If Bellesiles had written approvingly of the Bell Curve, he would be working at Home Depot now. He is a true believer, so they take a stripe from him for violating the basic rules of his profession and give him a chance to earn it back. This happens everywhere. We have a Congressman sitting on the most sensitive intelligence committees, despite being involved with Chinese spies. He hates white people, so no worries.

            I don‚Äôt know about that?There is spiritual or metaphysical equality and their is social equality. The apostle Paul had no problem returning the slave Philemon to his master. I don‚Äôt think the apostle believed in the modern progressive Christian idea of social equality.I also just cannot see the apostles running around advocating that the Greeks or Romans would be enriched by more Ethiopians.What we are living in is a perversion of Christianity.True, Christianity is universal.

                There‚Äôs quotes in the Bible of Jesus telling his followers to reject their parents and families.  And that their fellow cultists are their family now.
That type of belonging was one of the major draws of Christianity in its first several centuries.  Especially in the fourth when the influential bishops were preaching a community of poor ‚Äì and rejection of the preceding local identities.

                    True, it‚Äôs there. And just like the words of the Declaration of Independence about equality.  Those words in that section of the Bible can be taken and run with to no end.Christ was probably talking about His rejection by the Jewish leadership and social structure of His time.I don‚Äôt think He was advocating for Christianity to break up the family structure.Obey your father and mother is a part of the teachings and commands of Moses and Christianity after all.However I will grant that Christianity is a universal religion frought with many ways to use it for nefarious purposes.

                    Your last paragraph almost perfectly mirrors Nietzsche‚Äôs various critiques of the founding of Christianity. He deals with topics sometimes scattered about his various books. But a core one is his essay ‚ÄúThe First Christian,‚Äù of St. Paul. Paul was, says Nietzsche, looking for a way to update Judaism into something new. He took the teachings of the Nazarene, incorporated philosophy of Plato, and made his new faith more popular by incorporating aspects from various Pagan traditions then popular. Among these included resurrection, eternal life and championing the plight of the poor against the rich. ‚ÄúInversion‚Äù or ‚Äútransvaluation‚Äù of values will make the poor, the downtrodden, to be the righteous, while the successful, the rich, the powerful, are made to be the agent of evil. The afterlife promises a reward (also an innovation) to more than make up for the suffering endured in this world. Somewhere he calls Christianity ‚ÄúPlatonism for the masses.‚ÄùQuibble the details if you like, but I think Herr Fritz has it nailed when it comes to a popular religion that provides solace to the poor‚Ä¶while, of course, allowing the rulers to co-opt and mold it to suit their own needs as well.

                        There is plenty of scripture besides Paul that references an afterlife.  Maccabees for starters ‚Äì why pray for the dead if they‚Äôre, you know, dead (which is why editing 1000+ years after the fact causes issues).  So not sure how much of an ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù that was. IIRC there were different schools of thought within ancient Judaism on the afterlife question.

                Agreed ‚Äì the modern day cult is essentially a heresy gone to seed.  In the absence of a vital Church to reign in the loons, the heresy has gained institutional support.
All madness ends eventually.  In our era, sane men need to assert themselves.  They stand like Pentheus, transfixed before the mad cult of Dionysus to the point of being devoured by it.  Where Pentheus failed, the sane of this era must succeed.

                c matt:  Those ‚Äònations‚Äô are still separate nations in heaven.  There‚Äôs a distinct difference between spiritual salvation and earthly miscegenation.  And nowhere did Jesus speak against slavery or servitude, only on mutual social obligations.  The only slavery part I recall was Moses et al, now used as justification for so much evil.

                    The Bible (indeed, probably any venerated holy text) can justify great good ‚Äì or great evil. Here‚Äôs a few examples (I don‚Äôt have citations tho.)
Abolitionist? Quote Jesus: ‚ÄúHe came to set the captives free. Those in darkness have seen a great light.‚Äù Etc.
Slaver? ‚ÄúServants (or Slaves) obey your masters.‚Äù Or the letter to Philemon, already mentioned today.
As [?] said, the Devil can cite scripture for his own purposes (and he does, in the temptation of Jesus). So can everybody else!

            You think ?I mean, the Romans did the same thing.  bringing ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù to the hordes.  In fact, it always seemed to me that the spread of Christianity was a like the kid brother‚Äôs attempt at playing a Roman.And before them the Greeks.  My Greek friend never forgets to hit me over the head with the fact that the Romans stole pretty much everything from his people.  And I say, ok, except for the butt plugging.   And I suppose aqueducts.Point being, as people have long maintained, the English essentially carried the torch of the Greek Empire, or western civilization, or that the English Empire was the carrying the torch of the Roman Empire.  And now America has been entrusted with it. But obviously we dropped the torch and lit ourselves on fire.  Now maybe the Russkies or the Hunkies can do it.  The torch keeps getting passed around.  But the heart of the matter stays the same.  And the heart of the matter is the spirit that lives in white people.  Yes it varies among the tribes, there are nuances, but the differences aren‚Äôt all that extreme.

        &gt;   Erasing a man from a picture and banning any mention of him still leaves a hole. Rewriting the man‚Äôs history, weaving it into the story of the opponents solves two problems.One of the greatest memory-holes of history is that Rhodesia even existed at all.  It‚Äôs especially that way because it showed what might be the greatest resistance of Whites to an existential threat, and also their greatest betrayal by fellow whites.  As the new state of Zimbabwe collapsed into a typical African country, they had to ignore any memory of the peaceful and stable country that the West destroyed.  I‚Äôve been trying to find a physical copy of Ian Smith‚Äôs memoirs and can only come up with used books costing 50+ dollars.We‚Äôre going to see a similar operation in South Africa as they are making their rapid progress in full Africanization, though this will be far harder, as Mandela is a secular hero and the Truth and Reconciliation Committee was supposed to be a model for the United States.

            I used to work with an Afrikaner. He called his homeland a third world country with first world infrastructure. After a couple of drinks, he would call is an African country with European rules. After a few more drinks he say that most Afrikaners know that when the infrastructure begins to fail, it is time to leave or prepare to fight. I never knew which side of that dichotomy he was on, but given that no Occidental countries will take the Afrikaners as refuges, we may see another bush war.

                SA will be a great test of what, if anything, remains of Whitey‚Äôs testicular fortitude. Afrikaaners were once like Canadians, Aussies, and New Zealanders, in that they punched WAY above their weight class militarily. Even the Japanese feared them.
Now? I guess we‚Äôll see. As for the rest, I‚Äôll just note that my tablet‚Äôs autocorrect changes ‚ÄúAussies‚Äù to ‚Äúsissies‚Äù‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôre still pretty macho compared to us decadents here in the Evil Empire.

                    I met an Afrikaner at a secret handshake society meeting who was part of a group planning for what we see today. They were not just preppers or goofball militants playing soldier. Frankly, they were more like a religious sect. They were not small in number either. They owned a lot of land and they were organizing around their ideas.

I approach, first one says, ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt hear anything‚Äù when I asked. Other one blurts out, ‚Äúwe heard you but didn‚Äôt know what you were saying‚Ä¶‚ÄùLike two little children. I let them know, one on two, one more over flight I come over and we get it on. They sheepishly promise no more, soon pack up and leave with their little toys.That there an interaction with three white men, all middle aged. One, coward Mr. SA. The other two sniveling children, also cowards. These are the ‚Äòmen‚Äô that are going to ‚Äòsave‚Äô just what exactly?This just before the covid hysteria. Mr. SA shit the bed I heard, would not come out of his house. Had cut him adrift after the airplane incident.

                        Frankforce, I recently had a similar situation at a gas station with a little foreigner who parked in front of the air pump station and went inside to shop.  When he came out five minutes later I gave him a few choice words about where to park.  He challenged me to a fist fight, and my adrenaline almost got the better of me.  I was a good high school wrestler and can bench 225.  He weighed about 140 pounds.  So I knew I would crush him like a bug with one or two punches.  But I quickly remembered the world we live in.  There were cameras and witnesses everywhere, and did I want to spend the night at the police station and face possible criminal charges over some goofball stranger, or did I want to go home to dinner with my family.  If we were in a more remote area, I‚Äôm afraid of what I would have done to him.  But it‚Äôs a different world today.

One of the resort features was an evening bedding-down of a large herd of Javelina, which are best describe as a type of native, pig-like, desert animal.There were many visitors from other lands who had never seen these animals in their native environment before.  This nightly herd bedding was an advertised attraction.  This SA‚Äôer was I believe a Boer farmer and he was observing with me and few dozen others.He scoffed and said they were just a ‚Äúbunch of pigs.‚Äù  I reverted to my academic lecture mode and tried to explain that they looked like pigs, but we not classified in that family.  He looked at me and said ‚ÄúOh yeah, watch this‚Äù.  He cups his hands to his mouth and make some gawd awful guttural sound.  The pigs‚Äîone and all‚Äîimmediately alert then scatter into the desert on a dead run, never be seen again that evening.  He turned to me and said ‚Äúsee, they‚Äôre pigs!‚Äù  (I assume he was imitating a distress call from pigs in SA)Well, more than one visitor and the resort staff were piss‚Äôd at this old Boer farmer.  I hustled him off to the bar for drinks and we waited there for the wives.That‚Äôs the only SA I ever met.

                    My onyl contact with SA‚Äôs was a woman. I was in college in Ireland for a semester and she was living with her irish boyfriend she met at, ahem, a kibbutz.
She was sooo bossy, and I hated her accent.
That was in the early 90s.
Incidentally, her Irish boyfriend gave us americans the initial tour around campus (Galway). A coed from Bard college asked where the Lesbain and Gay club was, he assured her they had one, and that Ireland was A-O-Gay.
I was clueless in those days.

I get you, but only intellectually. My nature overrides that programming if you push too far. But I also have training and experience to handle myself in these situations that comes through the transgressors backed down.

                    Perhaps someone here knows whether this is ‚Äúlaw‚Äù or simply ‚Äúregulation‚Äù, but Cubans have for years had special status wrt remaining in the country.  I believe it‚Äôs law.  Basically, if a Cuban touches land, he can remain‚Äîasylum needing no justification.  If they catch him in open water they can immediately return them.  It was mockingly termed, the ‚Äúone dry foot rule.‚Äù  It is as old as Reagan era.

            If the Globo elites were smart, they would immediately airlift the Boers to European countries, and spread them out so that their numbers / influence is thin.Whites might start getting some of the wrong ideas if they see Boers fighting in Africa.Unfortunately, what‚Äôs more likely is that they successfully carve off a chunk of territory in the Western Cape. Then, the USA, France, or England nukes them, or provides South Africa with arms to relentlessly attack the white section, kind of like Rhodesia. However, it‚Äôs not 1990 anymore. Would China be opposed to a white state in Africa? Most of the world doesn‚Äôt care, and the USA is a declining power.Wild card scenario: Russia ends up letting them in as refugees. I hope they stay and fight though.

            The preamble is answerswhythe government was created and thoroughly refutes the notion of a propositional nation.IMO. The American revolution was mostly an anti-colonial rebellion. The declaration used a lot of specious rhetorical flourishes to justify that rebellion to enlightenment intellectuals in Europe that had their own hostility to their monarchies.   The founders at the time certainly didn‚Äôt believe most of the BS.But then, after being successful more and more people came to accept the specious DoI on its own terms.Cialdini‚Äôs book Influence has a chapter on that phenomenon, wherein an argument used to justify an action transforms into a central motivating factor over time, in some people.

            According to the very good people who put out propaganda for the Federal Court system, the preamble makes the United States effectively a Kritarchy.  Watch the second video where a diverse group of students talk about what the different phrases of the preamble mean to them.  An Asian claims that ‚Äúfor ourselves and our posterity means, ‚Äúfor our children and the children of others.‚Äù  A black kid follows up with saying it means, that whoever comes to this country should have ‚Äúlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.‚Äù  They won‚Äôt hesitate to rewrite the meaning of the Preamble to fit their aims either.It is like the progressive Christians who try to boil down the entire meaning of the Bible to one verse in the book of Micah that includes the phrase ‚Äúdo justice.‚Äù  To them justice means whatever progressives are pushing politically at any given moment.https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/us

            Wolf:  Ultimately they‚Äôre all just words on paper.  It‚Äôs the spirit of the people and their progeny that give them any power or authority.  Same goes for ‚Äòrule of law.‚Äô  No such thing as magic dirt nor magic papers . .. nor magic people.  Just stouthearted men who were willing to sacrifice for the future and their progeny.
