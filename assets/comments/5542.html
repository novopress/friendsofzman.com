        It is so horribly sad that the leaders on all sides failed to call a halt immediately as the full extent of the horror of trench warfare became apparent.There’s a YouTube video on shell shock that will show you what the horror of the trenches did to young minds. The odds of death or serious injury were excellent and the men knew it. Even the most willing troop had to know the viciousness of senior offices who sent them on such pointless missions. Haig would remark on how certain sectors showed a disappointing lack of spirit in offensive operations, that worthless, heartless, murderous bastard.Paul Fussell detailed the British refusal to construct adequate dry accommodations.Six months of trench warfare and 1400 years of dealings with Muslims ought to be enough to alarm any reasonable leader but it is not so. The last 25 years has seen a succession of loathsome Western political leaders in the main characterized by stupidity, conceptual dimness, historical ignorance, economic ignorance, fiscal profligacy, monetary stupidity, concupiscence, fairy tale notions of human nature and differences, cronyism, leftist lunacy, lies, and treason.In medieval England, the eldest son would be whipped every time land was transferred. Prime ministers, presidents and senior generals ought similarly to be whipped when every 100th foreigner arrives in the nation.

        I could argue that the Russians were worst served by their leaders from the beginning, but that would be quibbling.  The Kaiser was certainly down at the low end of the monarchical gene pool.

        The great issue here is the impending demographic collapse of Europe. The continent is emptying of caucasian people and being replaced with moslems from the middle east and north africa.  This is a fait accompli and cannot be stopped if the progressive policies are not reversed.  Can a government order white citizens to produce children on the penalty of a cutoff of social benefits and jail time?

            I think it’s better to ask what incentives can be created and what disincentives can be removed. Compulsion isn’t necessary.PR and school instruction could promote motherhood as something noble and patriotic instead of engaging in the constant messaging of tough women cops who cause men twice their weight to cease resisting by their mere touch and gruff voice. Women should not be lauded for being (fake)  kickboxers and assassins and feminism should be ridiculed mercilessly.Tax incentives should make it financially easier to have children. Abortion needs to cease and single women should be compensated for carrying children to term and giving them up for adoption.Let us just say certain people should be encouraged to return home or face severe disincentives to have lots of children. We had best regain our ability to discriminate forcefully and unapologetically. We are due processing and equal protecting ourselves to death.Such ideas as these NEVER see the light of day but the lunatic option of importing foreigners to solve demographic problems is the ONLY thing we EVER hear.

        I don’t see Merkel’s Miscalculation as the end of Europe as such: the process had been going on for a long time thanks to the EU. Germany was, as they say, just following orders. But the boundaries (and there will be boundaries once more) will mean smaller areas and while some of these areas may well have a lot of muslims in them, my view is that once the free money dries up whole boatloads of them will bugger off back to whence they came.The significant thing is that there will be areas with no muslims, and for all the differences between Brit, German and French we are a lot closer to each other than bearded twits with their covered up women trailing behind them. Sadly, our media hasn’t spotted this yet, but even the dense idiots at Al-Beeb will see it soon enough.One thing that will accelerate it is that more and more Asian men (for Asian in the UK read Pakistani) emerge from the shadows and try to rape white women openly. After all, their supply line of vulnerable girls might well be greatly reduced of late.By the way, on our stupid media, I actually cracked out laughing when I read one news report here of a fire in part of a mosque ‘administrative buildings’ in south London which — being the Dhimmis that our media is — contained the line “Thankfully the mosque was not damaged.” When our silly journalists use the word ‘thankfully’ in relation to what is an alien and hostile religion, you know we are entering the end days.

            I also read that about the London mosque, but my reaction was slightly different: “Damn! Why didn’t the whole thing burn to the ground!”

                That mosque was a yasidi mosque, who are just as harmless as Baha-i or Mennonnites…Which goes to show people should check facts before running their mouths…By the way, Yasidis have pretty much been exterminated on all the umma, along with christians.

                        “That mosque was a yasidi mosque, who are just as harmless as Baha-i or Mennonnites…Which goes to show people should check facts before running their mouths…”Then: “Actually, an Ahmahdi mosque”Yes, I take your point about running ones mouth.But here’s the thing: my criticism was about our supine media. I accept that mosques exist, but would this report have used the word ‘thankfully’ about a church fire? Nope, I don’t think so, or at least have never seen it (and I have been looking at news for a good number of decades now)And yes, it is still an alien religion to my islands

        What you wrote is not just the purview of the German Human Extinction Movement, it is an allegory for the entire existence of the modern state.Industrial suffering, misery, and death, on a genocidal scale is what states do:“…The story of German leadership since the founding of the modern state is one of suicidal squandering of their most precious resources for no good purpose, beyond self-aggrandizement.”You bet its “relevant today”, that is an understatement of enormous proportions. Genocide is the state. And the state is genocide.The world is run by fucking homicidal psychopaths.Look all around, everywhere its war, war by proxy, war by cultural Marxism, race war, war for profit, for control of energy, food, natural resources.War to crush liberty.And people scoff and are horrified about the idea of secession, abolition, to be free from slavery of the state.Lord love a duck.(PS, Im not barking at you Zman, I’ve had it up to my craw with the insane maniacs running things. Those fucking sonofabitches are who should be run through the meat grinder of genocide)

        Analogies to the fall of the Roman Empire are done to death, but does no one remember how badly the wholesale importation of Goths &amp; others backfired?
