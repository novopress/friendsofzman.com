        OT I was re-listening the podcast on the way home from work. The end about Trump being the Mule. He sees himself as a deal maker and redeveloper‚ÄîMAGA‚Äî but he‚Äôs the agent of people I call the Wreckers. More or less the mini cohort of the GWOT. Anyway, Trump likes his rally boomers and based blacks, and he went down in flames with them in ‚Äò20, but I wonder if he remembers the people who gave him IT in ‚Äò16.

        Ok Z we get it. You called the conservatives out on their b.s. But are you not got lower taxes? I‚Äôm quite sure as a long time reader / listener you are for much lower taxation.So what would you call people who want radically lower taxes? Simply dissidents?

            Our problems are so far beyond lower taxes it can barely be articulated in the same sentence. ‚ÄúLower taxes‚Äù is such a fucking boomer tier take on the ‚Äòmost pressing issue of the day‚Äô.How about the genocidal levels of population replacement? Find me a politician willing to talk about -that- instead. Or the rampant and largely ignored negroid crime sprees in all major cities. Should I go on? Taxes are a concern when you live in a homogenous high functioning society not a rapidly decaying multi-ethnic hostile empire.In Summary: Are low taxes good? Yeah, and its like Item #21 on the list of 20 other FAR more pressing items that have to do with total civilizational collapse.

                It‚Äôs been mentioned a few times here but literally, tax cuts don‚Äôt matter. The government takes in ~18% of GDP before the tax cuts and takes ~18% of GDP after the tax cuts. It takes ~18% of GDP after they raise taxes too. Tax cuts just shift money around more than it makes a real difference in what people are paying to the feds. The beast has never been starved and will never be starved. In the end it just turns into a stupid distraction so conservacucks don‚Äôt have to talk about real solutions to real problems.

                    The reason that is true is that investment capital flees. The US is on the high end for capital gains tax. Russia, for example charges no tax for capital gains held over 3 years.  Some countries don‚Äôt tax it at all ‚Äî they would rather have the investment and consequent businesses than the tax revenue they might get if they screwed savers as badly as the US does.This might all change if The Thing manages to get through his ‚ÄúUnrealized Capital Gains Tax‚Äù but I doubt it would happen. People who bought a house for $250k that is now ‚Äúworth‚Äù $400k are not going to be able, let alone willing to cough up 20% of $150k, or $30k in additional tax next year..

        One tidbit I think many are missing: your taxes are not private anymore. One of the first Lawfare actions was leaking the OMB tax returns. Followed by his associates leaking out. Message: Elites can get you.As Sailer pointed out, Raj Chetty was not the only one to get masses of tax returns with all sorts of data regarding income and occupations and other stuff (like expenses). Other researchers get that too. And if you use any of the commercial software packages like Intuit or Tax Slayer or what have you, THEY retain your tax data and sell it off. That is their business.You can‚Äôt really send in paper returns anymore, the IRS sits on them until July out of Beer Flu fear, so that is out. You are forced to use the services, though for ‚Äòsome‚Äô filers the IRS finally has some sort of no doubt extra leaky e-filing system that goes direct to anti-fa.Who btw are out in force today shutting down the Golden Gate bridge and O‚ÄôHare airport in Chicago over the Palestinians.Over the weekend, 19 retired Admirals and Generals filed an amicus curae with the Supreme Court arguing that Trump should go to jail for ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù (and the real threat was signalling to the Court that there will be coup to prevent OMB from stopping the Draft coming to prop up Project Ukraine). Also the Judge in the Manhattan case is requiring Trump to be at the trial so he cannot campaign. At this point its a lock for Brandon, like Parker Lewis he literally cannot lose. We will see a military coup before the Regime allows Trump back in.It always comes back to Ukraine. The Regime has to have it.

            You can‚Äôt really send in paper returns anymore, the IRS sits on them until July out of Beer Flu fear, so that is out.Why not? So long as you make sure you paid in enough in withholding, or at least as much as you paid last year, you are golden. One can only hope that they would sit on that $485 check a few months.
If you are not writing a check every year, you really need to adjust your withholding.

We have always filed paper returns, and plan to do so until they ban them.  We expected a huge delay, but got our refund (last year we had to pay the gov) in about a month,

        I‚Äôve been reading Z for about four years now and today‚Äôs article is a good example of my content and frustration with his writing. He presents a thoughtful argument about what‚Äôs wrong, but offers zero suggestion on how to solve it. I get that a lot of his work is meant to be meta and more of a thought-inducer, but it leaves the reader going, ‚Äúyea, good point , and‚Ä¶..?‚Äù

        Honestly, I do my own taxes. TurboTax told me that I paid a blended tax rate in the neighborhood of 14.5% last year. (That‚Äôs taxes you paid on the income you received, before all the hocus pocus involved in preparing a tax return.) This year, I‚Äôm up to 19.38% and I will probably stay there next year. The tax I pay to the state is minimal and the city is two and a half percent, which I could avoid if I moved to a township.Honestly, I can‚Äôt really complain about taxes at this level of taxation. I do thank the Republicans for this. That is the one thing they did right. The only thing.

            I‚Äôm probably in the same ballpark but I have to say, I could stomach a 20% tax rate much better if it was spent productively on my people, in our interests.  Instead, so much of it is frittered away on rent seeking middle men, and ne‚Äôer do well dregs.

Why not? What are you getting for your ~20%?
Keep in mind most brokerages worth doing business with are under 3%, and more than a few are offering 0% to 0.5%. Is it really worth 20% to try to get Russia or China to nuke your hometown?

                    Neither does the state. They are just the middlemen, taking money from some to give to contractors who do the actual road-building and arms production, and a whole crapton of stuff I don‚Äôt want, like buying Zelenskyy a couple new villas.But even if we could somehow hold the state to it‚Äôs core mission, the state has proven to be possibly the most expensive way to accomplish any goal. Everyone would be better off leaving charity to the churches and local communities, for example. But the state needs the money flowing through their hands to be able to skim off their cut.

        Let‚Äôs define ‚Äúrich‚Äù though.  Obviously, the real rich (the elites) do NOT pay their fair share.But to most people (especially non-whites in the USA) think the term ‚Äúrich‚Äù applies to any gringo not living paycheck to paycheck, who owns a house, etc.  What used to be a normal middle class American is considered ‚Äúrich‚Äù by the masses today.I submit that someone even making 400K even up to a Million bucks per years is NOT rich; especially if they live in NY or LA.  Sure, they‚Äôre making good scratch and can buy nice things, but they‚Äôre not the ‚Äúreal rich‚Äù who run things and have an army of accountants and lawyers.

            Why should ‚Äúthe rich‚Äù pay more for, say, roads? They likely use them less than thehoi polloi, just enough to get to their helicopter which gets them to their jet. Bloomberg famously used his chopper as his daily driver.Or police. Mostly they are served by private security.Or consumer protection. They just use lawfare.Or aid to Ukraine/Israel. What benefit accrues to them that does not accrue to everyone else?Or ‚Äúcommon defense‚Äù? We are sitting ducks, while they can jet off to their getaway in New Zealand.Why exactly is their ‚Äúfair share‚Äù higher than the 20% tax on their long term capital gains? What benefit accrues to them that does not to you, that you get at a substantial discount?

                    Agreed. I was just coming up with any arguments I could think of to justify taxing ‚Äúthe rich‚Äù more.
I think ‚Äúthe rich‚Äù who are government contractors, particularly in the MIC are the only ones it might apply to.

                They should pay more because we‚Äôve seen what they do when they hoover up too much money. They start buying government and controlling it.If they sat in their basement counting money and thinking of new ways to make money, I wouldn‚Äôt care that they had money. But these people use that money to buy our government and to flood it with third worlders, shove windmills and solar panels on us, make us drive overpriced battery cars, gambling, pornography, force us to eat bugs, decide that we‚Äôre going to have a secular society, force us to go to war for Israel, carbon credits, etc. Anything for the billionaires to make money.They do all kinds of things with all the power they have because of that money. So yeah, count me as one of the people who believe that they should get hit harder. The old folks were right about this.

                Also, have you noticed how Jewish billionaires became a thing in the last 30 or 40 years? They are what, 50% of all billionaires? That doesn‚Äôt happen just because you‚Äôre smart and hard-working. There are a lot of smart people out there. To a large degree, it‚Äôs a rigged game.

        Debt is the real destroyer of individuals and of nations. A quantum of debt is literally a piece of economic nonbeing that cannot be expunged or cancelled. It can only be moved around the economy in a game of infernal whack-a-mole until somebody makes the sacrifice necessary to fill it in.This is the dark secret about debt that makes it such fearsome enemy: it will be paid back, one way or another, with or without the conscious will of the debtor. Many people think that someday their debts will be cancelled, ‚Äúwritten off,‚Äù as they say. This is impossible. Debt is not just a negative figure on a ledger. A quantum of debt-money spent means that something was consumed without any coincident production to pay for it. If I buy a steak with money that I earned, then I have contributed something of equivalent value to the economy and the world is no poorer as a result. I paid for my consumption with production (Say‚Äôs Law). But if I buy a steak with debt-money and eat it, then I have contributed nothing of any value to the economy and the world is poorer by one steak. And it is this missing production which is therealdebt, not the debit on the ledger. The world‚Äôs real, physical steak-deficit cannot be replaced until somebody produces another steak without consuming it. Just as debt is really only consumption without production, the repayment of debt must necessarily be production without consumption. There is no other way to make the world whole again. It is either that, or the steak deficit becomes permanent. There is no third option.This is why debt destroys. We think about the collapse of the World Trade Center on 9/11 as a dramatic instance of wealth destruction, but the CRE crisis currently working its way through the guts of the market could be the equivalent of hundreds of 9/11s, and that will destroy office towers no less thoroughly than airliners do. That is just the beginning. America has trillions of dollars worth of destruction waiting for us, because we cannot hope to reproduce everything we‚Äôve already consumed.Debt is a silent killer that always in the room, always one step ahead of us, like the Kayako ghost inThe Grudge. 2008 was one of those ‚Äúironic revelations‚Äù that let you know your doom is approaching. The culmination of it all will be horrific.

            ID, I share your instinctive repulsion at debt.  You didn‚Äôt even mention the infinite quantitative easing that Obama let loose after the 2008 housing crash.  (I was stupid and moved most of my savings into cash in anticipation of a crash, and missed the biggest and longest bull market in history.)Capitalism seems to be mostly built on debt.  A new business venture almost always seems to require assuming debt.  There seem to be few ventures where the new enterprise has its own money to spend.As an exercise in Aryan frugality, I wonder what our lives would be like if massive debt wasn‚Äôt an option for new enterprises.  Would we be better off?  Certainly we would have fewer businesses and choices because fewer people would have the accumulated capital to spend.We love the choices of Amazon but rue the demise of local Mom N Pop shops.Is restraining debt the only way to restrain global financialization?Can any of you big finance guys defend infinite debt?

                I can‚Äôt defend itper se, butcontraID‚Äôs characterization of debt, itwasfreely accepted in exchange for some good or service, just as whatever he produced was accepted in a roundabout way for the steak. It‚Äôs not the debt that‚Äôs the problem. If Atlas shrugs, that debt isn‚Äôt worth the paper it‚Äôs not printed on, and whomever is ‚Äúholding‚Äù it at that time ‚Äúlost‚Äù.2008 was a fantastic opportunity, BTW, unrivalled since 1929. Even liquidating stocks at a loss, you had the chance to turn it into actual productive assets at in many cases under a dime on the dollar, making it back within a month or two. Thus why the banks and hedges made out so well. The bailouts were just icing.As Denninger (?)  repeatedly points out, the money is made at time of purchase, not at time of sale. Just a restatement of Rothschild‚Äôs (?) blood in the streets.

                        Maybe. What‚Äôs bad debt, other than something you determine in hindsight?
Banning all debt? Worth considering, but how do you deal with exigencies, or enforce it? A furnace going out in the middle of winter might need replacement right away, even if you don‚Äôt have the cash. And if you go to your boss to get an advance, do you throw the both of them into the clink?

                        Thinking about it a bit, can we even distinguish between good production and bad production?
For example, we are probably good if @ID‚Äôs business is manufacturing laundry detergent, but what if it‚Äôs underage gay pron?
I think we kind of have to know what it is that is being produced before we can decide whether it‚Äôs something we should incentivize.
And even then, it requires some moral structure beyond whatever is being discussed.

            ID, there are two broad types of debt:  One is used to increase production of goods or services; the other is used to consume (goods or services).  Once something is consumed, it is gone and no longer in productive service.  You seem to have this concept, but are unclear/or conflate in your explanation.Milton Friedman was one of the major proponents of this concept.  I‚Äôve yet to see it refuted to my satisfaction.  If everyone saved for their first business venture, we‚Äôd be a worse country indeed.  If everyone saved for their first car, a better one.Debt for consumption beyond productivity‚Äîmicro or macro‚Äîis indeed a recipe for disaster.

                        I don‚Äôt think things would be all that much worse. You can‚Äôt get rid of any market, even a stock market. All you can do is push it underground to the black market.
Prostitution, drugs and the numbers game are good indicators, IMO. Being mob-controlled didn‚Äôt make them go away, or even make them too expensive for the poor to afford. It just made the consequences of getting in over your head too dire to consider.

                    Depends on who is placing the bet, and how he structures it. Generally, though, he would do it as an LLC or equivalent, and shield his assets.
However, there are reasons to not shield your  assets, generally that you can get better terms because you have more skin in the game, like DJT did with NY state developments. In retrospect, he should have lent Trump corporate assets to a new LLC to do the developments, but no one knew the Dems would be so evil so soon.

That depends. Borrowing to create production is inherently a call option, as the venture will only pay off if you were correct about customers willing to pay for more or higher priced widgets in the future.
If you have the inside information to outperform the hedge fund managers, then, yes, it can net out positive. But if you misestimated the fickleness of future buyers, all you‚Äôve done is squander the savings representing previously produced goods, at best to be sold off at fire sale prices.

                Money borrowed to start a business (i.e. a self-liquidating loan) may indeed be structured as a loan but in reality, it‚Äôs more like an investment. It should just be considered an investment with a zero-equity stake, and the lender should be legally obliged to take the haircut if the business fails instead of saddling the borrower with the (now nonperforming) loan.
There are simple legal fixes for this kind of thing.

                    That‚Äôs already the case. The whole point of incorporation is to protect the principals‚Äô non-corporate holdings. It‚Äôs just that as a creditor, you are first in line to a split of the assets of the defunct company, broadly speaking, followed by bondholders, followed by preferred stock, followed by common stock. Anything left over (there wouldn‚Äôt be in this case, because that wouldn‚Äôt be bankruptcy, but say it was a spinoff) would go to the principals.But only in the case of true liability or fraud would the principals‚Äô personal assets be at stake.

            What destroys is not debt but interest on debt (aka, the sin of usury, denounced throughout history but embraced in modernity). The compound interest eventually makes the debt unpayable, resulting in some scheme or other to clear the debt (e.g inflation) or outright repudiation. The result is always economic calamity.

                Usury isn‚Äôt simply interest. It is interest plus *recourse* to a person. All debt should be tied to an asset (a business, car, etc) and non performance simply means you get the asset. This is why usury is like slavery, it forces a person into bondage.

                    Let‚Äôs go with that distinction. Who would lend you money for a car if it‚Äôs going to lose at least 10% of its value the moment you drive it off the lot? Before you make your first payment, it could be nothing more than a burned-out husk of scrap metal, and best case, it‚Äôs probably lost 1/3 of its value within a year.Same with a business. It‚Äôs value has almost everything to do with the decisions and business practices of the guy running it. Why would anyone lend to unproven entrepreneurs?Why would there even be a thing like student loans? Either you or your parents saved up, or you go get a job stocking shelves or flipping burgers.I‚Äôm not saying that would necessarily be a bad thing. Car prices would plummet, because those of us paying cash wouldn‚Äôt have to outbid people who are paying credit. Those without the ability to pay cash would just have to ride the bus. It‚Äôs different. Whether that‚Äôs good or bad is subjective.On the positive side, you can already live your life without usury. It just limits your choices.

        America‚Äôs best tax law is Colorado‚Äôs TABOR.  It limits government spending increases to the inflation rate.  Taxes collected in excess of the TABOR spending caps are returned to taxpayers in cash.
Granted, states can‚Äôt print money, so the rules are constrained.  But TABOR was brilliant move back in 1992.  Every 2 years the Democrats try some new scheme to break TABOR or keep the refunds.  They lose 70-30 every time.
Taxes might not matter as a subject of public policy.  But in practical terms, people still care about them.

        The republicans would never even commit to a tax rate.  Instead, the unreachable goal of ‚Äúless‚Äù became the rallying cry, while continuously growing the state.  Meanwhile, the middle and even working class began to see ever larger portions of their paycheck going to taxes through inflation driven wage increases. In the 1960s, even the middle class was earning less than the higher rates and paying effectively 10%. But since the 70s, despite losing ground when adjusting for the true inflation, these classes make way over the lowest tax rate and all of that income (above the low rate) is taxed at the higher rate of 24%.Despite all the crying about how our apparently fragile ‚Äújob creators,‚Äù the vast majority of evidence is that the tax rate is not a major driver of growth. The tax rate on the wealthy was 90% above a certain number in the post war period.  This was a period of unprecedented growth. While it is not apparent that high taxes cause high growth (though I believe they can be, at least to a degree), it is equally not apparent that high marginal rates crater the economy and scare away all these magical ‚Äújob and growth creators‚ÄùTheir plan, which has been successful for decades is to fund the progressive projects and war machine with printed money, pretend the rate of inflation is much lower than it is and stick the middle and working classes with the bill through inflation.

Just helped out at our church with people who wanted assistance figuring out taxes. The highest rate for up to 89k for married filing jointly was 12%, and that was only for the fraction of income between 22k and 89k, after subtracting the deductions. Most of the 2 kid families got everything back, and a not insignificant number got net refundable credits, so got back more than they paid in through the year.

                They paid 10% or less in the 60s.  Of course, not being an accountant, I can only go by what I find on the internet.  But I do know for certain that many, many people had taxes go up in the 70s and 80s by having a large portion of their income at the higher rate.  Without that wage inflation, all their income would have still been in the lowest bracket.

        Maybe I‚Äôm crazy, but I think the feds should stick to their core mission and fund themselves by taxing commerce, i.e., tariffs, sales tax, road tax, securities, etc. It‚Äôll never happen, because people might consume less and save more.
Iirc SCOTUS once said taxing labor is tantamount to slavery, and I agree. I think the same way about property tax, but I guess that‚Äôs more of a state issue. Earn a living, put a roof over your head‚Äî bad! Trade and raid‚Äî good!

        You can say whatever you want about libertarianism, or conservatism, and it‚Äôs probably true, but the fact remains, I have never once in my life seen a tax cut, no matter whose taxes were being cut or by how much or how little, that I didn‚Äôt like. Not one time.But that‚Äôs largely just a shell game. At the federal/empire level, the taxes exist mainly to support the value of their fiat currency.Because the real tax that the regime has agreed to levy is the inflation tax. Which we have been paying for a long, long time. Longer than anyone has been alive. Over most of its history, it was barely perceptible, hardly noticed. The scumbags even managed to normalize the idea that 2% annual inflation is healthy and good. But that was their inflation tax, slow, steady, inexorable. Lately it‚Äôs larger, so more people are talking about it, but it‚Äôs not a new thing.Perhaps inflation is really sort of a societal greed index. A non greedy people wouldn‚Äôt need to inflate to pay for things they couldn‚Äôt afford but felt entitled to.

            Totally agree about tax cuts being always welcome. Living in Oregon you really can‚Äôt help thinking you would be better off with lower taxes. This is the 3rd worst ‚Äútax hell‚Äù in the country. Guess the other two and be totally unsurprised.Think of tax cuts as a beautiful musical instrument, maybe a violin, not quite Stradivarius level but close. Now think of Conservative Inc as a retard plucking out ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù on it with the end of the bow while simultaneously headbanging his tard helmet against the wall and screeching out the lyrics at the top of his lungs. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the instrument. The problem is the ‚Äúmusician‚Äù.

            I don‚Äôt think there has been a net decrease of taxes for most people in the entire post war era, largely because I think you are ignoring a different inflation problem, which is inflationary wages.  Inflation has steadily bumped the vast majority of people into a higher tax bracket.  With deductions, the working class paid absolutely nothing. This was largely true for most of the middle class in the 60s and before.  But all those wage increases to keep up with inflation ever since (which they never quite did) put ever larger portions of their income into higher tax rates.Now we can add in the inflation tax on top of the inflationary wage tax increases.

            What I find interesting about the late 70s era that you reference is that, at that time, relatively small breasts were still hot on women.  Farrah, Cheryl, ‚Ä¶In the 80s, there was a rush for gigantic breasts, even if obviously enlarged through surgery.At the risk of donning on my tin foil hat, I suppose that there was an intentional push for big breasted women, even when fake, to disparage our lovely smaller breasted, and often blonde, girls.Even moreso for small versus large asses in the 90s.  Black girl asses were promoted.Negroification by intention!  (And who pushed this?!)

                    I don‚Äôt have a link for you, but I recall reading of a study that showed men tend to desire the physical attributes they are conditioned to desire. To the point where men conditioned to like fake breasts will prefer them to natural ones (just to name one attribute). And that this isn‚Äôt just true for men, but animals as well, when so conditioned.

                        That seems to support the idea that boys could be groomed for homosexuality. I‚Äôve always resisted that idea, believing that there has to be a genetic component to gays. Maybe not, maybe sexuality is more plastic than we think??

                        I don‚Äôt know about you, but they are never going to get me attracted to morbidly obese black women, even if they are in the VIctoria‚Äôs Secret catalog.  It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôve only recently come to my attention.  From the time I was 12 I was exposed to African Americans on a near daily basis.  I‚Äôve never found the vast majority of them attractive in any way.  Maybe I consider the top 10% attractive at all.  Even they do not compare to a White 5 in my eyes.

                Yes and quite nasty those fat jiggly butts.
Most breast implants suck too.  It is very difficult to reproduce the natural breasts of a young ( 20s) woman with a bag of silicone, especially when laying on her back.  They become circles.
The other women of the world can do whatever they want, they will never measure up to the beauty and variety of the White woman.

        In what should be a great irony, tax day is when conservatives gather to praise ‚Äúthe rich‚Äù (let‚Äôs accept Z‚Äôs shorthand here) by treating the rules of taxation as holy.It‚Äôs not only legal but unimpeachably ethical and rational that people who sell stocks pay far less tax than people who sell wrenches, because *that* income isn‚Äôt income.It‚Äôs a beauty of creation, on par with a sunrise, that broke guys with the worst jobs lose a ruinous percentage of their pay to the government, because that‚Äôs not taxes, it‚Äôs prepaid retirement‚Äîwhich statistically they‚Äôll die before they get ‚Äúback.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a moral horror that nearly half of income taxes are paid by ‚Äúthe 1%‚Äù who receive far more than half the income and own almost everything.Etc.For some real fun on this holy day, remind a conservative commentator‚Äîall the ones on the internet are some kind of bureaucrat‚Äîof the indisputable mathematical fact that government employees don‚Äôt pay any taxes whatsoever, they just ritually mock the act.

            There is the issue of property. Once you‚Äôve earned the money to buy a stock, or a house, or any other investment, it‚Äôs property. When you sell it, you‚Äôre usually just keeping up with the inflation rate and that‚Äôs it. So why should they dip into your capital when it‚Äôs something you worked for and paid tax on?

        Forgive me for going off topic but we‚Äôve got to laugh when we can. And each tax day becomes all the more infuriating the more we discover about this failing GAE.From a pretty funny comedian out of Canada:‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trained to not have a sense of humor as we give up the country to migrants. We see migrants all over the place now. I saw a 40 year old migrant African dude during the snow storm. It was obvious he was a recent migrant, because he was walking around trying to catch snowflakes on his tongue. All I could think was that guy better not be my Uber driver because he‚Äôs going to be shocked at the road conditions.‚Äù

            There was an older woman begging outside of Kroger‚Äôs this afternoon. I mean like literally outside the front doors. Some foreigner, Muslim, wearing some kind of a head wrap.Call me someone with conflicting feelings.1. She needs help, the kind thing to do is help your fellow man.2. Who TF let somebody in this country who doesn‚Äôt have a sponsor and can‚Äôt support themselves?3. Maybe our neocons bombed the hell out of whatever village she came from and that‚Äôs how she ended up here.

                TempoNick:  Highly, highly likely it was gypsy.  Most Americans mistake them for Indians or Arabs.  If she was begging, she was a gypsy.  They are an incredibly dishonest, sly, parasitic race.  No, she does not need help and no one bombed her village.  Her people have been parasiting off Europeans since the time of Alexander.Call her a gypsy (she will get nasty) and ‚Äì if you give enough of a damn and live somewhere the police might still care ‚Äì call the cops.  Ten years ago in DFW ‚Äòburbs the cops would get rid of them.  Then they became protected.  And watch your wallet and anything else around her.  They kidnap White kids as well.  Have been doing so for centuries.  Vile creatures.

        The automated/simplified system at IRS is both convenient and deadly.My experience ‚Äì I wrote the quarterly payment amount in the wrong row of the 1040 (one below where it should be). The final tax calculation and everything were correct.Within a month, IRS software recalculated my 1040 and decided that I should get $30K tax refund instead of $5 or so that I expected. I got a huge check back in mail. At the same time, I got an angry letter that I did not pay $30K taxes (plus interest/fine) and needed to pay it pronto.Sorting these out through IRS‚Äôs phone system was nightmare, because hardly any person understood the problem and even worse understood the solution around the automated software system. I sent back the $30K, submitted a revised return and again got $30K tax refund and another angry letter !!Finally after 6 months of back and forth, a lady at IRS with Asian accent figured out the simple math of it to help me out. I suspect this lady will get replaced by ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù AI in the next iteration.

            Here‚Äôs my little tax horror story. Way back in 1987 I was a college student making ends meet‚Äìsort of‚Äìby delivering pizzas. Well, I was completely ignorant about tax machinations at the time, and when I did my 1040EZ for 1987, I neglected to report my tips!That steamed up the suits and cigars over at the IRS but good and they came after my ass with all guns blazing. They audited me and slapped me with a fine massive enough that it knocked me out of college for four years.So, if anybody ever tells you that the IRS isn‚Äôt interesting in your piddling income tax or that you can somehow slip through the cracks, give ‚Äôem a poke in the chops for ol‚Äô Kozelskii.

                I once went a dozen or so years without filing an income tax return. And then one year I started filing again. Nothing happened. This was about 14 years ago, I‚Äôve been filing ever since, and still nothing has happened.
It should be noted that during all but one of the dozen or so years I didn‚Äôt file, I was just costing myself money in sacrificed refunds. I was not making enough, or owning enough, to be costing the feds anything.

                A tale of two cities so to speak‚Ä¶As a college student, I made a $37 dollar or so addition error on an income tax form for about $2K or so income.  I got a viciously nasty letter from the IRS threatening me with all sorts of penalties if I didn‚Äôt mail them the $37 dollar ‚Äúcomputational error‚Äù within 10 days or something.   Yep, the IRS recognized this shortage as a computational error, certainly they also knew that my entire income was a couple of grand or so, but instead of simply stating‚Ä¶‚ÄùDear Sir, we believe you‚Äôve made a computational error in your 1040 in the amount of $37‚Ä¶‚Äù. No they simply threaten you quite rudely and demanded immediate remedy or else!Several years later, I made another error in my State return in the amount of $10 or so.  I got a phone call in my office from the State examiner.  He was apologetic in the whole and pointed out where the error was made.  He said he did *not* want to pursue the matter further, i.e., collection letter because that causes so much work down the line.  He asked if I would consider mailing a check for $10 to his attention at the Dept of Revenue and he‚Äôd add the check to my form and move it along as paid in full.Never paid a bill so fast in my life.  Screw the Fed‚Äôs.

        In the aftermath of the 9/11 attack, the US Federal Government has spent about $10 trillion fighting foreign mini-wars against goat herders and built overly complex and expensive military equipment that cannot be operated by the low IQ POC that dominates the current crop of recruits. In contrast, China built a highly robotic automobile assembly plant that churns out a finished auto every 17 seconds. How did this happen?Answer. The President of the United States shits his pants. That statement is not hyperbole. It is a fact.And tens of millions of Americans will vote for him to keep shitting his pants for four more years. This cannot be fixed without a collapse.

        Also noting that right now we have double-digit inflation (and will until spending is under control), and progressive tax rates that are not indexed for inflation.  So, unless their is a big adjustment to the brackets, people whose pay is almost keeping up with inflation will soon find themselves in higher brackets paying the ‚Äútax the rich‚Äù rates on very middle-class incomes.

        There‚Äôs also a little chestnut out there about many or most American believing they too will become rich. It‚Äôs some sort of spell placed upon the masses that ‚Äúyour big break is just around the corner.‚Äù  This helped drum up support of the rich by the poor.
I don‚Äôt recall the numbers, but this is likely a contributor to the overall sentiment of the Fox News viewership.

            I have said a number of times that government spending no longer has any functional connection to tax revenue. They create debt currency in amounts that exceed the GDPs of most countries on Earth. There is never any thought at all given to ‚ÄúCan we afford X?‚Äù Thus, taxes exist solely as a means of reward and punishment.

        During the 2000s I put lots of energy into opposing illegal immigration.  There were a number of free market conservatives who defended open borders, whom I really came to hate.The one whom I hated most was Stephen Moore, who served with Club for Growth, WSJ, and Heritage Foundation.  He would say all the unbearable things like immigrants deserved America more than the lazy white working class.  When Hannity would have him on, my teeth would grind fearsomely.Today, he writes for Taki, which is bizarre.  The title of his most recent article?  ‚ÄúBiggest Corporate Welfare Scam of All Time.‚ÄùWhat disgusts me about this man is that he still believes that if we could just embrace laisse faire economics then everything would be right in America again.  He represents the treason of the elites against the traditional American people.When I‚Äôm grouchy, I think of some of the people that I would like to meet alone in a dark alley.  Stephen Moore crosses my mind.

            Of the three, it is going to be Medicare that blows it up. Social Security is a badly designed system, but it is predictable. Medicare brings with it the combination of a huge cohort of people entering the age when medical needs increase AND the cost of those needs going up rapidly. The cost of relatively new/novel treatments are insane and they want them all (which on some level is understandable). I can‚Äôt see how this will ever add up in an actuarially sound way, in that a person‚Äôs Medicare expenses are less than or equal to what they paid for the coverage over the course of their life. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt, and nobody expects it to. Every single person on Medicare will be taking far more from the program than they put in.I think right now, entitlements + debt spending is equal to 100% of tax receipts, which means that the entire military and everything else is on the country‚Äôs credit card. It‚Äôs only going to get worse.

                Yes, it‚Äôs Medicare that‚Äôs going to blow up. The current Boomer stock is very bad shape. I‚Äôm sorry to say that the Gen Xers I know have also not been taking care of themselves. The number of surgeries that involve ‚Äúrebuilding‚Äù some part that are about abuse/poor nutrition/no exercise and not accident is insane.The last year of life can run into millions of dollars. There are not going to be very many Boomers with DNR. When it blows up, it‚Äôs going to start with Medicare.

                    I was just reading a book about the bad old days of polluted water and food full of germs and the successful campaigns to end both. Our modern purveyors of food and drink no longer provide comestibles contaminated with bacteria and viruses. Instead, we have food full of toxins and nutritional disasters (e.g., sugar, HFCS, pesticides, trans fats, and seed oils). Chronic disease has replaced infectious disease on the menu.

            Social Security and Medicare will still be around, but SS will be worth less and you might get means tested out of some of that. But you‚Äôll still get a decent portion of what you‚Äôve been promised.
Medicare ‚Äì which is the big problem ‚Äì will be more interesting. It‚Äôll still be around but at what quality and what price. I‚Äôd suspect the cost of Medicare will increase and the quality of doctors accepting it will fall, which means that you‚Äôll have to get very good (very expensive) Medigap or something like that to go with Medicare.

                At some point, the eligibility age for medicare has to rise. No way around it. Probably as the result of some late night congressional vote with no public discussion prior. And then again, as needed.

            As noted before, SSI has a recurring source of funding and failure clause in the law.  They must reduce pay out to revenue, equally, across the board.  The effect here will of course affect grandma and grandpa, but not the general revenue‚Äîunless Congress fills in the gap with more deficit spending.Spending on Medicare/Medicaid is of course much, much worse, basically unfunded, and is the big unknown.  However, such seems to be a problem elsewhere in more ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù nations like GB, where the NHS is suffering under the pressure of the elderly and immigrant refugees.  The monies allocated yearly for that nation‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù healthcare seems never enough.My prediction is we will see rationing of healthcare.  The poor will suffer as the must, the rich will do as the like.

            You are correct, but not in the way you state it.  You will certainly receive your $2500 or so a month in Social Security, but everything you buy will cost $3000 more.  And you will have full health insurance, unless you actually need it to cover something.  The government will have control over you, but your net benefits will be negative.  Thank you public servants!  Please take an extra round of bribes and make a few more insider trades.

                Rationing of health care will be the norm.  This rationing however will be subtle.   They won‚Äôt necessarily tell you you‚Äôre too old for a knee replacement, they‚Äôll just put you on a waiting list for a couple of years.  Or for example, you need a CAT scan to check for cancer. You get one scheduled 4 months out.  Or you need to see an oncologist and get scheduled 3 months out.  We‚Äôve seen such in many socialized medicine countries.

            He actually did some good things.  He doubled the standard deduction, and limited the deduction for state and local taxes to $10K.  This resulted in many more people that don‚Äôt need to itemize, and people with high property taxes in NY and CA lose much of their deduction.  Basically a wet dream for the George Will/Jonah Goldberg type grifters, who had to pull of their conservative masks and show their hideous faces.

                ‚Äú‚Ä¶limited the deduction for state and local taxes to $10K‚Ä¶‚ÄùMan I hated that. I know that the income limits on that mean it doesn‚Äôt affect the vast majority of taxpayers, but conceptually it is exactly the opposite of what people who want to limit the federal government should want.We should want the bulk of our taxes to go local, and then state. Not go to the federal government to be handed out to states and localities as rewards and punishments. It should be the federal government that gets the short end of the stick when the full tax bill is tallied up. That change created exactly the opposite incentives.

                        They shouldn‚Äôt but the more the federal government gets short-changed in tax revenues and the more that goes local, the less your state will be subsidizing other states. There should be *more* state and local deductions for federal taxes, and state and local taxes should generally be higher than they are, instead of making up the difference with federal grants.Limiting the state deduction ensures that the federal government is first at the tax trough and that more and more your taxes fund projects in other states. The more New York is responsible for its own revenue and projects, the less what goes on in New York matters to you.

I live about midway between Indianapolis and Chicago, so regional news is heavily slanted towards those cities. Chicago made out like bandits over COVID, not just because the businesses are utterly corrupt so got the PPP Cash, but also that the government used COVID Cash to make good on the amount they‚Äôve shortchanged public pensions over the last few decades. North of $100 billion, as I recall. That money had been skimmed off for friends and family of the connected, and the rest of the friggn‚Äô nation was forced to make good on it. Even states running a budget surplus who don‚Äôt have income taxes had to chip in.I‚Äôm all for local, local, local, but not if other communities have to bail out your ass.  Cuz that‚Äôs not exactly local, local, local.

                        @Vizzini, how so? Illinois is by some accounts the highest tax state &amp; local in the country, and they shortchanged the pension funds before the SALT limit.
COVID was just a convenient excuse. They use disaster and environmental funds the same way. They just have to hang in until the next D gets (s)elected president.

                He also reduced the number of brackets which also simplified things. My taxes went up a bit because of this, but with the exception of reporting capital gains (stocks), our taxes today aren‚Äôt much more difficult to prepare than the old 1040EZ.  Not having to pay a CPA every year is a tax cut, too, of sorts.The only times we‚Äôve ended up itemizing are years when we donated a lot to charity.  Since Trump reformed the tax code, most people do fine with the standard deduction.That‚Äôs also nice because it weans people off the old mortgage interest deduction‚Ä¶which was probably the biggest deduction for normal people if they didn‚Äôt have several kids.  It encouraged indebtedness instead of paying off the house.

                    Good points.
Sounded a little fishy, though possible depending on his other deductions, but one of the guys from church who is comfortably middle class wrote a $10k check to charity, and he said it didn‚Äôt bring his deductions up enough to make it worth itemizing. Which is too much, IMO. Absolutely no incentive for substantial charitable giving, but rather to spend it all on hookers and blow.

        Interesting post, Z Man.I remember an episode ofThe Simpsons, that was probably released in the mid-90s, where Homer scrambles to compleat his tax returns. Of course, Flanders has it all done well in advance! The funny thing was that Homer worked for the Nuclear powerplant, and I recall wondering whyhehad to do this. Of course, I was young and dumb.I also recall my father, a self-employed man who ran his own business, spending hours throughout the week sorting out taxes and staff payments. He was under no illusion how much he paid, which is one reason why I believe small business owners are (or were) a key cornerstone of many freedoms we enjoy (or enjoyed).In any case, the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system is what we have in England for most people; and, by the Good God does it hide what you really pay. I‚Äôve always made a point of calculating my own tax (which, invariably, is neverquitecorrect!) just out of interest ‚Äì and the results of the theft are staggering.It was well acknowledged by many tax lawyers and accountants that such a mechanism as PAYE, where your employer takes care of it all for you, would result in a general numbing of Joe Normal as to how much cash is stolen from him. Perhaps that has happened. Just one more step in the ‚Äòdumbing down‚Äô of our societies.I note further that most people even struggle with the basic idea of compounded interest as well as percentages of proportions of a wage ‚Äì but, according to some, we‚Äôre getting smarter! I‚Äôll let you decide the next time you buy groceries and the checkout girl cannot even give you correct change without her till helping her.

            OrangeFrog:  Employer federal tax withholding was yet another ‚Äògift‚Äô of that bastard FDR in 1943.  So most people over 35 just automatically know to subtract ‚Äòx‚Äô amount from whatever their supposed salary and income is.  Most younger people incessantly bitch about it but still support all sorts of equally socialistic financial lunacy like UBI.  The portion of my husband‚Äôs annual salary that is withheld for taxes, social security, and medicare (which we will never see) is simply staggering.  If we had even 50% of it back ‚Äì without any interest ‚Äì we‚Äôd be very comfortably retired.

            It‚Äôs already true, Jack. The powers that be are trying to create workarounds (other than trust funds) for themselves, but for us working-class schlubs, they have already rewritten the minimum distribution rules for children inheriting money their parents saved pre-tax. Specifically, they must take it all out within 10 years of death of the parent, which will be in their high-tax years, instead of letting it be based on their own retirement age.Net result is that all that cash they put aside for their progeny is already being looted. And to the cheers and raucous applause of the Boomer Haters, who somehow have not realized it‚Äôs not the Boomers that are being screwed, but the Haters themselves.If you were counting on inheriting from your Boomer and Xer parents, the IRS just gave you a big F-You.

                        Huh. Our tax guy said that because we are 1-income, only the one earning the money was allowed to give it away. The stay-at-home spouse was not eligible, so, in our case, we were limited to just 1x for each of 2 kids. That‚Äôs not chicken feed, but, shoot, if you‚Äôre middle class and you‚Äôve been halfway decent at putting money aside, you are probably pushing a million in tax advantaged accounts by the time you retire.

                        @steve:
3g is right about the gift tax exclusion part (combined maximum of $36k, I assume the $72k referenced two children). There also is another method known as the ‚ÄúCrummey Trust,‚Äù which your tax guy may have referenced, but that money is in an account as I understand it and likely also to be viewed as low-hanging fruit soon.
That was a good point, 3g, and more important each passing day. I have followed it a long time.

                        Steve:  Perhaps it‚Äôs changed?  At one point, when my father was still alive, my parents each gave us some money.  Same with the in-laws, and my mother-in-law never worked.  And when I had to do my jury duty hell in 2019 the issue came up, and I don‚Äôt recall any mention of it being limited to the working parent.  I suggest you check into it further.

        When the deadbeat debtor can no longer borrow, it prints. Inflation drives prices higher. Demand slows and paper currency reverts to its true zero value. Mises called it the ‚Äúcrack up boom.‚Äù The process can be slowed by gains in productivity, conquest and plunder.
Eventually the well run dry and the kids will be eating bugs. But when? How have we lasted so long?

        ‚ÄúTax collections are at record highs, but the deficit is also at all-time highs. The federal deficit in 2023 was $1.7 trillion.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs no coincidence. The federal deficit juices the economy which juices asset prices. Change in federal tax receipts has increasingly become correlated with asset prices.We‚Äôre now in trap.Even if our politicians found religion and tried to cut spending and raise taxes to get back onto a sustainable path, such as action would likely slow the economy causing asset prices to fall. Even without a recession, tax receipts would fall, blowing out the deficit, making debt to GDP even worse.More likely, such austerity would cause a recession, lowering asset prices AND requiring more unemployment spending and lower corporate taxes, the combo of which would really blow out the deficit.So, to fix deficit problem in any meaningful way would require two things ‚Äì each of which is nearly impossible on its own and astronomically impossible together:1. Congress decides to work together to address the problem of long-term deficits.2. Congress comes up with a plan where the resulting slump tax revenue from falling asset prices doesn‚Äôt offset the spending cuts/tax increases.The only hope would be a very long-term, credible plan to slowly (very slowly) cut spending and raise taxes to right the ship over the next decade. Even that plan would see debt to GDP continue to increase but it would slow and eventually level out over the next decade.There is zero (less than zero) chance that this could happen.Instead, they‚Äôll keep spending and hope that the bond market plays along, which, eventually, it won‚Äôt, which will lead to a quiet form of yield curve control. What happens then is anyone‚Äôs guess. Could be Japan. Could be Argentina.

                There is an old axiom about hard money that applies here. If your government is so corrupt you need a god standard to control them, your government is corrupt enough to find a way around the gold standard. This applies to everything. We have a corrupt, alien ruling elite that generally hates us. The results follow.

                    I find a similar phenomenon when I read economists discussing debt to GDP. They note that countries almost always get into trouble when debt to GDP gets above 90-100% and definitely get in trouble when it hits 120-130% debt to GDP.The only exception is Japan for somewhat unique reasons.Regardless, these economists only look at the situation from one angle. They note how difficult the math becomes once your debt to GDP gets above 100%.But they never turn the problem on its head and say, ‚ÄúMaybe the main problem isn‚Äôt the high debt to GDP but the politicians and system that allowed the country to get to such debt levels in the first place.‚ÄùI tend to see the high debt to GDP levels as a symptom of a disease, not the disease itself.

                        DLS,Yes, and that‚Äôs a huge advantage. Because the world has to hold dollars ‚Äì usually via treasuries ‚Äì some of the debasement of the dollar is put onto foreigners. It‚Äôs a very good deal.It also means that the dollar is stronger than it should be, which is a good deal for some (DC and Wall Street) but a bad deal for others (US manufacturing).That‚Äôs why the end of the dollar as the global reserve currency would ultimately be good for the US ‚Äì though bad for DC. This is why no other country even wants to supplant the dollar as the GRC. Why would they? They see what it did to the US. China doesn‚Äôt want it manufacturing sector destroy.

                    I don‚Äôt think the axiom is true, though. It‚Äôs just propaganda to turn people away from hard currency.
For example, the productivity gains of the 19th century were reflected in deflation, even with a partial adoption of an inflationary bimetallism standard. The government was only able to get ‚Äútheir cut‚Äù by instigating wars, and those wars were becoming increasingly affordable as ammunition prices and especially the contributions of Colt and Browning hit the market.
In order to get ‚Äútheir cut‚Äù in an era of increasing productivity, it would be necessary to add a central bank and decouple from hard currency.

                Apparently, Friedman never heard of debt.
Btw, as much as people rightly trash on the Modern Monetary Theory, I suspect that it‚Äôs very useful in helping to understand how the system works. Now, it‚Äôs completely worthless in terms of prescribing solutions but it does help describing the situation.
I feel like Z once said the same things about Marx‚Äôs work at the time that he wrote about the economy, but not sure.

                        Their basic premise is that ‚Äúmoney‚Äù ‚Äì and thus debt ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt matter because the govt can just print it.Govts aren‚Äôt constrained by money. They‚Äôre constrained by the physical capacity of the economy, i.e., inflation. They argue that the govt can print all the money that it wants until inflation starts to rise at which point, the govt has to slow the money supply or reverse it via taxes.In many ways, they‚Äôre correct. But the idea that the govt can fine tune its doling out of money is far fetched.MMT is also built for people who love govt and govt control, so even if it‚Äôs a reasonable description of how the system works, it‚Äôs still dangerous.MMT in practice will always lead to inflation.

                    MMT isn‚Äôt inherently inflationary, so long as government increases taxation to sop up the excess cash. All they need to do is keep the ratio of money to goods constant.
Which is the real reason MMT hate conservatives, who championed lower taxes for anyone and everyone. MMT requires the government to have the power to raise selectively taxes any amount, for any economic class whose price levels are increasing. If rent on studio and 1 bedroom apartments is increasing, they need to be able to raise taxes specifically on entry-level workers without affecting others whose prices are not increasing.

        &gt; When the baby boomers were in their prime working years, it was good politics to promise them lower taxes and greater returns from their investments.

        ‚ÄúConservatives‚Äù are relegated to the dustbin of history not simply for their embrace of taxes and multi-trillion dollar deficits. They have completely embraced the Police State and abandoned the Bill of Rights.Just last week the scumbag Mike Johnson broke a tie vote in the House that would have required a warrant for the government to use FISA data against Americans. You would think that the Constitution and the Bill of fucking Rights (LOL, you don‚Äôt have any) would automatically supersede pedestrian Congressional legislation, and that Congress requiring a warrant would be redundant, but you would be wrong.When the time came for the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù Speaker to vote to affirm the Fourth Amendment, he cucked, just like he cucked on the trillion+ spending bill that gave more money to Ukraine and Israel than to border enforcement.Piece of shit.

        A little-known secret is that if you are in your sixties there‚Äôs little reason to file a tax return anymore. The IRS backlog for pursing tax compliance issues is about ten years. By the time the IRS gets to your case you will likely be dead or on death‚Äôs doorstep, at which time you can structure a settlement with the IRS for 30% to 50% of the taxes you owed. The IRS ceases enforcement of unpaid balances after 10 years, so if you drag it out longer the amounts due from the bottom of the ladder drop off the bottom rung after ten years.Get your passport renewed before you stop paying, and renew it every few years, because at some point you will be flagged by the IRS and the State Department will not renew your passport. This is an incredibly easy way to throw sand in the gears of the system.

            Guest:  The assumption is that most people in their 60s are retired (my husband‚Äôs friends who worked for the federal or state governments are retired; most who stayed in the private sector/self employed are still working).  The entire tax structure is designed to support older retirees and those getting government bennies (ss, medicare, pensions, disability, etc.).  I see endless YT comments from people 50+ who are all retired and are recipients of multiple programs.We take none of the above, and the amount we pay in taxes is staggering.  We‚Äôve been using my husband‚Äôs 401k to supplement income for family needs and anti-fragility goals (paid off land, house, vehicles, debts, helping our sons, etc.) and it‚Äôs biting us hard.  The assumption is you won‚Äôt need or take it until you are retired and in a low tax bracket, but we aren‚Äôt ‚Äì so it‚Äôs significantly impacted our tax bracket for the past two years.  Even being old enough not to have to pay the early penalty, the cut the feds get is sickening.

                Tax collection is a civil process, not a criminal process. The IRS doesn‚Äôt do anything until they get a judgment against a taxpayer. The IRS typically doesn‚Äôt initiate the process for at least ten years, because their backlog is so deep. Once initiated, the process to obtain a judgment can take 2-3 years and costs the IRS tens of thousands of dollars to obtain, which is why they routinely settle for 30% of the amount due.If you are a typical middle-class or even upper middle class that does routine W-2 withholding (or pays quarterly taxes) the odds that the IRS will initiate a collection action against you within ten years are near-zero. You will get some nastygrams from the IRS, but that‚Äôs about it. I‚Äôve guided dozens of people who wound up in tax trouble through this process.I‚Äôve been around here basically since the beginning. The deterioration in the comment section over the past five years is painful to watch, and the responses to my comments are exemplary. If you don‚Äôt have anything useful to say, why do you feel compelled to say anything?

Pretty sure its an administrative ‚Äúlaw‚Äù process, not a civil process. It‚Äôs not going to be heard in a common law court, but rather in a special tax court, with its own rules for proof, evidence, due process, etc. And at the end of it all, they still have the option to toss your butt in jail or have you just summarily executed, which is not true of your typical civil court.

        When the government collections something between 17%-20% of GDP in taxes every year since World War II, like clockwork, no matter what the rates are on paper or how the code is structured, but the government spends 22%-27% of GDP every year, then the problem isn‚Äôt that the taxes are too high or the code is too complicated.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauser&#x27;s_lawSo this clever analyst noticed that no matter the tax regime, the current US postwar ‚Äúsystem‚Äù can really only collect between 19-20% of GDP in taxes. This has been the most steady, reliable economic ‚Äúrule‚Äù in recent history.Now, you can always argue that the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù could be changed and that the burden could be distributed more fairly blah blah. But it would appear that we‚Äôve reached what the economists call a ‚Äúsaddlepoint‚Äù. To move from this taxation regime would require a lot of economic/systemic and possibly social dislocation.No less a figure than Dick Cheney, the perfect bogeyman fake conservative, said that ‚ÄúReagan proved that deficits don‚Äôt matter‚Äù. If there is any unifying mantra for the Uniparty, this is it. The opposing mantra, offered by my old economics professor Herb Stein, is ‚Äúif something can‚Äôt go on forever, it will stop‚Äù.We‚Äôre about to witness this dialectic playing out in the economy and the financial markets. Our first effort failed, Nixon closed the silver conversion window and we got 10 years of stagflation. In response, the Regime led the financialization of the economy and the dollarization of the world. This system has survived multiple crises intact. Grab the popcorn because we‚Äôre now going to test the outer limits.

            Chet:  My husband still does this ‚Äì refuses to do taxes online.  And even though we can‚Äôt itemize deductions, he still parses everything and always finds something unclear that leaves him intensely frustrated.  And now that we‚Äôve left Texas, we unfortunately have state income taxes for the first time ‚Äì and that just further complicated matters.

        ‚ÄúRarely said, but often implied, was the claim that a complex tax code allowed special interests to game the system and avoid taxes or bribe their favorite politicians to get special tax breaks.‚ÄùYes, of course. But this also applies to any complex legislation ‚Äî one example being the 2,000 pages of Obamacare.Other than the tax paid to the federal and state governments, there‚Äôs another more insidious form of tax ‚Äî the ‚Äústealth tax‚Äù of inflation. One hears little about this except from the likes of Peter Schiff. This stealth tax has been made possible because of the de-linking of the dollar from gold, and the consequent ability of the federal government to create new dollars at will. There‚Äôs some sleight-of-hand involved but the creation of dollars ex nihilo is what occurs and these dollars compete with the dollars in our pockets for a limited amount of goods, thus driving up prices and impoverishing us yet further. What will probably put paid to this dishonest system is the increasing reluctance of foreigners to buy dollar-denominated bonds and general ‚Äúde-dollarisation‚Äù; it‚Äôs this foreign purchase of dollar-denominated paper that has kept this stealth tax of inflation under control for the last few decades. Without it, the inflation will increase from a trot to a canter to a gallop.

            Foreign central bank bond purchases effectively allow us to export inflation. It‚Äôs pretty incredible. But it can‚Äôt go on forever so it won‚Äôt.

                Yes, absolutely ‚Äî for decades the US has been exporting some of its inflation. As that game is now ceasing, the US will have to keep all of its inflation and the consequences will be dire for most denizens of the country.

        It was not so long ago when you would take up a discussion of some important, structural problem that needed to be addressed. It would be with a, ‚Äúconservative‚Äù, be it a Blue Dog or a Republican. The conversation having a chance to get somewhere substantial was very quickly railroaded with, ‚ÄúYeah. But America is still by far the best place to be. Things are still great here, so we‚Äôll be okay.‚ÄùTwenty years later, Shapiro and Fink are on a coordinated tour to explicitly pull away social security, The Fed is taking it away stealthily with compounding inflation, and Fink and His Boys are making a play to manage your money from cradle to grave.It is like the GWOT. Twenty years ago there was a patriotic America, (a fairly robust white majority), for Team America to lampoon and parody with spite. Now, a Palestinian guy sets up a tabletop ala Stephen Crowder in Minnesota and invites Imams to lecture how evil America is and then has his 6 year old lead a chant of ‚ÄúDeath To America.‚ÄùIt kind of makes you think things about how Bush II and his team should go out.This is an interesting article related to taxes, welfare and the future of Americans.https://www.amren.com/news/2019/10/race-welfare-and-media-lies/
