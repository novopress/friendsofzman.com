        I really like that you have replaced the plague doctor image with that of a resurgent phoenix. Hopefully, this  means that you are definitively turning the corner.

        Do any of you boys know anything about the Redoubt or James Wesley, Rawles?

It sounds like they would make the same mistakes of the USA all over again.  “I am a separatist, but on religious lines, not racial ones.”  But maybe a Christian theocracy would have the self-confidence to apply to brown people the special treatment required to force them to be civilized.  It’s not my first choice for my people or a nation, but it would be a huge improvement over the current USA.

            Sandy. Consider:
Rawles:
“The reason for his Christian criteria was as much pragmatic as it was theological: “In calamitous times, with a few exceptions, it will only be the God-fearing who will continue to be law-abiding.”

                Thanks, WCiv911.  Religious faith does not come easily to me, but it can clearly be quite efficacious.  Respect to my Christian friends.  (And even if I don’t want any Muslims in our lands, I must be impressed by their mettle.)
If I ever become religious, it will probably not be due to some divine inspiration, but rather because, historically it has emboldened men to fight and inspired femininity in women.
(Where I live, the Mormon women are noticeably more feminine than the rest.  If I were more unscrupulous, I would pretend to be a Mormon…)

            Budesonide &amp; Azithromycin are literal miracle drugs.
But LONG LONG LONG since having gone off patent, ergo no Pharmaceutical Industrial Complex salesmen pushing those meds on doctors, ergo no under-the-table payola for the doctors, ergo the doctors no longer writing those prescriptions.
PS: I have no personal experience with HCQ nor Ivermectin, but as much as the Pharmaceutical Industrial Complex hated those two, I imagine they must be highly efficacious as well.

                Just a side note.  What I read wrt the above drugs is that they were demonized for one main reason, the “Emergency Authorization Act” for the COVID jab.
Seems this act states that authorization can only be granted if there are *no* alternative therapeutics available (to the jab).  The Fed’s could have been forced to rescind jab authorization had the drugs been deemed effective against Covid.

                    There can’t gave been any other reason for the concerted effort by TPTB to demonize those two drugs.  If the Coof was anything as deadly and frightening as they insisted, then it would have made sense to throw the kitchen sink at it.  Nothing would have been excluded.  But somehow these two drugs, despite reports of success and excellent safety profiles, were the targets of insidious slander.
Everything that happened during the entirety of the pandemic was geared toward EUA of the mRNA clot shots.

                I would add Azelastine nasal spray to the list of miracle drugs.
That stuff is so good it enabled me to stop getting shots for seasonal allergies.
They finally made it available OTC a few years ago.

        Since Z Man is presumably fighting for his life and unlikely to pull through (dark humor), I wanted to note a cultural milestone of significance.For well over a decade, some dissidents have argued that the primary explanation for our decline is anti-whiteness and the primary creators of anti-whiteness share an ethnicity.  Since most white people were used to thinking ideologically, many of them literally could not view the world tribally and rejected the anti-white explanation.  They claimed that the real problem was communism/”cultural marxism,” identity politics in general, affluence/degeneracy, or the greed of our elites.Elon Musk responded to a tweet by saying “You have said the actual truth” and that tweet said: “J3w1sh communties have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.”That the anti-white explanation has achieved this degree of visibility is significant.Of course, the world is complex and there are always multiple causes for any outcome.  However, these causes can be ranked in terms of their strength in affecting the outcome.If white people begin to view the world tribally, many possibilities may emerge.

            I had “it” two weeks ago. I think it was the latest iteration of covid. Because not exactly a cold and not exactly the flu. Seemed a little different. Worst sore throat I ever had. I was really sick. The worst of it lasted 3 days. Consumed two tubes of horse paste over about 5 days, including those 3. I dunno if that cured it, but it didn’t hurt.

Might not cure you, but you’ll feel better about being sick.
And the fun side of you came out in your writing after a couple of glasses. 😁
(I’d give you my recipe for a hot bourbon toddy, but I’d wager Der Germans don’t have bourbon in their stores, and if they do, the prices are ridiculous.)

            We laugh, but Coof-ism really is its own religion now.
My favorite example are the goofy 12-step instructions for the coof self-test that involve shaking and stirring the swab in the vial for 10 or 30 seconds.
They remind me of primitive rituals that try to find signs in chicken entrails, except the entrail readings have actual value.
