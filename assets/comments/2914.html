        “The trouble with this, in addition to be completely wrong, is that almost all people just want to live their lives. They don’t look to their rulers for a sense of identity.”Hey, that’s an amusing thought, followed by a bit called “The Hive Mentality”!

That’s hilarious. Spell check strikes again, I guess. My favorite all time spell check is when I wrote “gorilla war” rather than “guerrilla war” in a comment somewhere. I’m still laugh at that one.

        Foreign Policy is great, until someone doesn’t move their chess piece like you DEMANDED they do, so you can “win” the -Poli-Sci wannabe in “economist’s” clothing- delusion that “only steady growth can ensure survival in a zero sum “community”.Yep, “participation” trophies for EVERYBODY. Even the nice folks doling out the Nobel Prize seem to agree.

        Every nation dislikes if not actually hates another nation for some reason, imagined or concrete. Sometimes it emerges as aggression, non-cooperation or simply stereotypical jokes, which may or may not be actually funny.You can find all sorts of reasons countries don’t get along, from war to interference to exploitation. Most countries at some time or another have put ‘boots on the ground’ in other places or made demands of others.For what it is worth the US created a bad feeling in the UK during WWII. The US servicemen coming to the UK prior to June ’44 had smarter uniforms, better supplies (the UK had severe rationing) more money to buy what was available and being almost all male they found a local female population eager to do something enjoyable while their husbands/boyfriends were away. They were also dismissive of local traditions and ways, ignorant of Europe and carried it all off with attitude. Some of this was excusable, some not, some unfortunate. It’s hard to put a whole bunch of young men in a foreign country and expect them to behave or be anything other than what they were. Plus, there was a war on and most people  never knew what the next day would bring. You took what you could then and there in case tomorrow was worse. On top of that, the Europeans always have a jaundiced view of US military tactics as simply being driven by the idea of using as much ammunition as possible. A thousand bullets where ten might do the trick, sums it up.This is not anti-American. It is just how it is based on how it was. Without America’s intervention Hitler’s Germany could only be beaten by the Russian winter, and even that wasn’t more than 6 months each year. Europe was heading for stalemate unless Hitler ordered the invasion of the British isles and it isn’t clear he thought it worthwhile. Mind you, his lot were only partially welcomed in various occupied countries. There were for a long time bars in Rotterdam that had signs saying no German was welcome there, ever. Probably they have now been taken down in the spirit of EU love, but the fact was some Dutch really hated the Germans after much of Rotterdam was reduced to rubble.Slowly people forget of course what the original causes were, but some things still jar with a lot of people. No matter how much help a nation gives another nation, something will bother them and cause troublemakers to stir up dissent. A foreign policy imagining all that is required is to be nice to people sometimes misses the point that everyone prefers what goes on inside their own borders without impositions from beyond.
