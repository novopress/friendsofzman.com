        There seems to be some backpedaling from Congress with claims this somehow isn’t a law but “advisory.” That’s nonsense, but it shows there is pushback. There is no doubt this “advisory law” will sail through the Senate and “Biden” will allow it to become law. Courts may or may not strike it down. People indeed will suffer needlessly because of this madness.The problem, particularly for Republicans, is what has been seen cannot be unseen. These clowns have denounced cancel culture, safe spaces and other such abominations for year, yet have codified the very worst aspects of all of those. I refer to them as The Help and Ho’s from time to time but that’s very unfair to prostitutes.These people do not represent you in any sense and are only wield power through the barrel of a gun. Refuse to assist or support them in any way that will not result in your death or imprisonment, and ridicule the morons endlessly.

            What’s it say about the Jews when they feel they need a law to force people to like them?

                They don’t want a law to force people to like them. They enjoy forcing other people to humiliate themselves and do their bidding. That’s the really funny part to them, rubbing people’s noses in shit like a bad dog just because they can.

                    No, they’re just extremely paranoid due to the events of the 1940s. Honestly, I can’t blame them. Armenians have had a similar feeling since 1915 – and look at the ethnic cleansing that just happened in Ngorno Karabakh.

                        But paranoia can be paranoia of convenience, too. Hence, it can be used as a tool to get what you want. I don’t think most Finkels imagine a new Treblinka is going up outside of Scarsdale, but acting as though they do sure does generate a lot of benefits for them. Until it doesn’t…

                            You’ve a point there. Seems to work for our Black population and their never ending reference of slavery and racism to *excuse* their poor showing as human beings.

                        No. Half my family is Jews. They just hate you and want to hurt you. “Paranoia” is their public excuse. They don’t believe it. They don’t think they’re neurotic, traumatized, etc. They efface themselves like that to mock you. They think you’re not human and you’re not owed the truth about anything. They think I’m not human because my father is blond. The Ashkenazi identity is psychotic hatred of other European people (and loser Jews). It has no other contents.

                            Z: “Marco Rubio owes his political career, and thus his luxurious lifestyle, to a Zionist billionaire car dealer named Norman Braman. Rubio has been in the pocket of the neocons his entire career.”
ACKSHUALLY, it goes even deeper than that with Marco…

It’s not a coincidence that Marco Rubio and Jack “Ruby” Rubenstein have effectively the same cognomen.

        When I see these kinds of nearly unenforceable laws, I believe they’ll just be used as lawfare when necessary.  Only select political enemies will get prospected with these laws, not the conspiracy theorist (realist) in the black neighborhood.
Unconstitutional of course, but since they’ll only be used on select enemies, it will take them years and financial ruin to get them overturned

            The “law” in question is enforceable only at colleges/universities in the same way that they have their Title IX kangaroo courts for sexual assault, which are used to expel the one found “guilty,” but do not involve criminal charges. Same thing here, except the charges are “antisemitism,” instead of sexual assault. This law is not designed to bring criminal charges, either against students or anyone else. Private citizens are not (yet) in danger of being criminally charged with antisemitism.

                As we saw with civil rights laws, the first step is the establishment of the principle. That is why people should be threatening revolution over this Republican thought crime bill. It shifts the Overton window away from a debate over if speech can be abridged to how best to abridge it.

                    Of course. Yet there still persists a misconception that this bill makes it illegal to criticize hebrews, which is not true. And this silly notion is out there in the dissident sphere that this entire campus brouhaha that’s going on was engineered to expedite this 5 page bill which doesn’t criminalize anything. The brouhaha was indeed engineered and astroturfed, but I’m pretty sure for larger reasons than that.

                        Thank God you’re here to reassure us that we’re getting all worked up over nothing. Whew. Sometimes I watch the teevee and listen to weeks and weeks of propaganda for Israel and Judaism and transgenderism and homosexuality and abortion out of every media and educational and cultural institution in the West and think, wow, maybe I should be concerned that my opinions on this might be a problem for me if I contradict all of these signals.But they won’t! I’ll be free to express myself, that’s what the point of the Antisemitism Awareness Act is, there’s nothing to worry about at all. They should call it the Free Speech Act, actually.

I’m surprised they didn’t. Usually they give bills names exactly the opposite from what they really do, like the infamous “Affordable Care Act.”

Without doxxing yourself, can you give us a little bit of demographic background concerning the Chads [and the Staceys?] who held their ground in this matter?
Again, without doxxing yourself.

                                    Confession.  I got piss’d mightily one Saturday and spend the whole afternoon (of course, no where to go–all closed down) on the computer with Photoshop software and duplicated a CDC card with the vaccine record.  I had the benefit of a real card issued to a friend to copy.  When done there was no discernible difference.  No one I showed the cards to could detect the forgery.  Never needed it for travel, but the exercise left me greatly satisfied.

                        I shouldn’t have to tell anyone that we were already on the slippery slope long before this bill was introduced. And in that context, this bill doesn’t grease it up very much, relatively speaking. You were already in danger of being expelled from school if you said “Jews Bad.” As indeed a number of the protesters already have been.
All I’m saying here is that it’s a silly notion that these protests were engineered to pass this bill. Which should be apparent to anyone who reads all 5 large print pages of it. But they definitely were engineered. For something.

                                Meh, I’m pretty cynical about that sort of thing. I’m sure there was a paid “community organizer” or two ginning up these “organic” protests. That’s not to say that most people joining in aren’t doing it organically, just that this isn’t how it started.

                                    But whether they were doing so to generate energy for the anti-semitism bill or because they were genuinely sympathetic to the Palis is the question. I think in most cases, it was probaby the latter.

                                        Yeah, I think there WAS a lot of genuine outrage about the Gaza slaughter on the Left.But it’s hard to say whether Jewish involvement in the protests was genuine or cynically manipulative. The “surge in threats against Jewish community centers” several years ago turned out to be an Israeli Jew phoning in THOUSANDS of bomb threats. The ADL made a lot of hay out of it, though, and the Jews got millions in security funding.The funny thing about the Gaza war protests, as Anglin correctly pointed out, was that they were not violent and Antifa was notably absent.Then, oddly enough, Antifa showed up at Columbia and seized a building, and the cops had their pretext to storm the place, and the ADL got it’s anti-Semitism bill rammed through the House lickety-split.I have never considered myself a “conspiracy theorist.” But the older I get, the more I wonder about some of this shit.

                    I honestly don’t know why you are upset about this? America has been dead for a long long time. This is just flies buzzing around the decayed corpse.You and I as Straight White Males are basically at the bottom in terms of rights, privileges, and so on. There is no possibility of ourselves EVER having the full rights of say, a black lesbian and that stings. I know it is hard to let go of your memories of the flag, the national anthem, liberty, freedom. But its gone and never coming back. I still get a lump in my throat when I see the flag and here the anthem have all those memories all together rushing back … but they will never return.HOWEVER, as things turn sticky abroad for the GAE, we are now being seen as “needed.” As I said before many times:“All we are saying, is give War a chance. Peace is over, if you want it.”War requires competence and the revolution in military affairs  Iran showed on April 13 (it cost them around $20 million for their attacks, the US/Israel 2-4 billion to shoot down the drones and we could not shoot down a single ballistic missile) is scaring the Pentagon. Whoever has the most drone/missile swarms (which we cannot build at scale) wins. The only way to beat that is directed energy weapons at scale which means organizing nerdy White guys at scale cause Shaniqua won’t get that done. The Pretendian Wars of the 90s-2010s are over. Real War is here.Peace is over. If you want it.

                    Maybe, but things like public accommodation took the better part of a century to bite back. And if the courts don’t have a basis in law, Griswoldet al.demonstrates they have no qualms about just inventing penumbras and emanations to rule the way they want.
He’s at least right. Black letter, this isn’t a big deal.

            That is the best case scenario, M. I can see jewish censorship being the trigger of America’s SHTF moment. Not only is the law itself a trigger, but the people they attack with it could be too. The MAGA types are spitting nails in rage at the current lawfare against Trump. They may not be a majority… but that is a LOT of people to enrage to the point that they are willing to launch a crusade against you. You are daring an insurrection is what I think…

                The law is crazy and will most likely increase criticism of Israel. Their best tactic would have been to let the protests burn themselves out. But that would take intelligence, and these people are really stupid.

        Antisemitism has become what Z calls an “abracadabra word” that means whatever the group using it as a weapon against their enemies wants it to mean. Just like election deniers or climate deniers.Normies hear the word and thinks it means hatred of the Jews, but the meaning is key. They apparently can’t have you criticizing the Gazacaust or any other Israeli policy. Can’t have you reading a Bible that correctly blames the Jews killing Jesus, who was also Jewish.Most normies will be ignorant of this soon-to-be law until they run afoul of it and then it becomes a red-pill moment for many. At the least, it’ll be another cudgel for a regime that doesn’t need them to bash white normies into submission.And as for the Ole Miss frat boy getting hurled into the void for some monkey noises, why son are you at a protest with two parties that seek your annihilation? Only blacks and browns can protest and get away with it even if they cause widespread property damage and loss of life. You don’t have that right, white privilege be damned.

            “…why son are you at a protest with two parties that seek your annihilation?”It’s an old tradition in the Catholic church for the faithful to take note of martyrs for the faith. We usually make them saints and point to them for strength and guidance in troubled times.  Now I’m not saying these frat boys are saints, or even martyrs–but I will say that they help the morale of the “good guys”.  To hide under a rock and avoid confrontation is to cede victory to the Leftist hordes.No one in conservative circles attempts to paint George Floyd as a anything other than a low life.  And yet the Left rallies around him and even makes statures of him for all to see.  Why?  Best answer that one if you want to win.

        The Congress is owned by AIPAC. It’s as simple as that. Is that a good thing? No, of course not. Will this change via voting harder? I think not; but the illusion is a convenient excuse to stay on the couch. How much longer can this insanity persist? No one knows. Given this uncertainty, what is the best use of one’s efforts?

            Some of it is, some of it is not, and the wider “ownership” of the more important rule making bodies like the ADL, Soros / Tides Foundation, CIA, etc. is up for grabs. There is an enormous body of money sloshing around DC and it comes from everywhere: Qatar, the Saudis, the Iranians, the Chinese, Soros/CIA, all of whom are at odds with each other.The answer is “it depends.” It depends upon the particular constellation of interests, money, power, influence, and whose ox is gored. Who “owns” the ADL? Is it Soros/CIA, is it the Saudis? The Iranians? Where does their money come from, who supplies it, and who exercises real power in that organization (it is not always the nominal head). I could not even begin to guess.Our politics are so weird, erratic, and stupid because of the influence of “dark money” unseen by the public but with massive gravitational pull.

                And it all circles back to if the Congress were restrained to its Article I Section 8 powers, no one would give a damn who owned Congress, as they could not give favors to their donors anyway.
In a way, it’s a point of honor that our congresscritters stay bought. They have at least that going for them.

        “There is some universal standard of justice against which the laws are measured.”Universal standards are nonsensical without reference to God. Thus the failure of everyone from Kant to Stefan Molyneaux to articulate a universal, materialist morality.“No one suggests we deport people for telling jokes about fat people.”No, you just get fired from your job and rendered unemployable if you anger the wrong fat person or “virtuous” person.The question of authority always resolves to two possible answers, which is the collective will or the supernatural.Imagine imbuing the madness of crowds with moral authority. But we don’t even get that far. Consent of the governed is entirely illusory in the US and most countries. I’d rather live under a theocracy.

            I’d rather live under a theocracy.In other words, you’d rather live under a priestocracy of gasbags who claim to speak for a god, or gods, and we all know whose god(s) you are likely to prefer. This amusing irony won’t be lost on the Levantine supremacists who often call their god Ha Shem (lit., The Name).Now, you mentioned Kant, and a topic of the blog post is moral authority. Well, it so happened this morning that I read the following relevant passage:Kant, as I say, invented a new moral argument for the existence of God, and that in varying forms was extremely popular during the nineteenth century. It has all sorts of forms. One form is to say that there would be no right or wrong unless God existed. I am not for the moment concerned with whether there is a difference between right and wrong, or whether there is not: that is another question. The point I am concerned with is that, if you are quite sure there is a difference between right and wrong, you are then in this situation: is that difference due to God’s fiat or is it not? If it is due to God’s fiat, then for God Himself there is no difference between right and wrong, and it is no longer a significant statement to say that God is good. If you are going to say, as theologians do, that God is good, you must then say that right and wrong have some meaning which is independent of God’s fiat, because God’s fiats are good and not bad independently of the mere fact that He made them. If you are going to say that, you will then have to say that it is not only through God that right and wrong came into being, but that they are in their essence logically anterior to God. You could, of course, if you liked, say that there was a superior deity who gave orders to the God who made this world, or could take up the line that some of the gnostics took up—a line which I often thought was a very plausible one—that as a matter of fact this world that we know was made by the devil at a moment when God was not looking. There is a good deal to be said for that, and I am not concerned to refute it.https://users.drew.edu/~jlenz/whynot.html

Yes, I would rather live under the rule of people trying to apply the Bible to daily life than I would by people claiming the vote of Shaniqua and her buddies justifies any abuse the government wishes to heap upon me.Your passage about good and evil is full of logical fallacies.The point I am concerned with is that, if you are quite sure there is a difference between right and wrong, you are then in this situation: is that difference due to God’s fiat or is it not?

Of course the source of morality is external to good and evil as we understand it. You can put that as “for God himself there is no difference between right and wrong,” but it’s just sophistry. He has clearly told us there is a difference between right and wrong, but that doesn’t indicate that the differences are external to Him, or that the differences don’t matter to Him. There is no “good” and “evil” independent of God’s fiat. That’s the nature of a supreme being. You want to be able to judge God, but you can’t. You, by definition, lack the requisite knowledge to make such a judgment.

Yet another of the pantheon of devils that human beings found in the deserts of Middle East tricks gullible man into believing that it’s sadism is actually part of a secret occult plan for existence.
Meanwhile said devil engages in Trading Spaces-style gag bet with another one of the desert devils, Satan or Marduk or somebody, it doesn’t really matter which since all of them behave very similarly.
Generations of gullible humans continue the gag up until the present day.

If you’ve read Job (doubtful), your interpretation and rejection of God is what we term childish.  Your idea of God is that of a benevolent caretaker and in essence a “parent” who would never allow harm to come to his children.  Since this is not the case, there can be no God.
This is illogical and not the case.  I’ll leave it at that.

                    You display a profound lack of understanding of the source of Christian doctrine.The source of the different sets of “Christian” doctrines is delusional humans and, possibly, some other ignorant being(s) channeled in a trance. It’s btw that modern Jews have done an adequate job of explaining shortcomings of Trinitarian doctrines relative to Jesus’ own religion—which wasn’t Christianity at all. (Did J need to be saved?) These shortcomings include that bizarre old fetish with Mary’s sex life. The relevant passage reads ‘young woman’, not ‘virgin’. See the website and YT channel of Jews for Judaism for more details.the BibleWhich one istheBible? There are multiple contenders of different lengths and theological positions which compete for the honor. Christianity has no one “fixed, written scripture”, as you claimed below, forgetting again that protesters cut seven books from the papist Bible. Some Bibles aren’t even Christian, not even in an Arian or Gnostic sense of the word. The people who intend to eliminate “white” Christians reject their Bibles in favor of their own quite shorter version, which Trinitarians always misunderstand.Of course the source of morality is external to good and evil as we understand it.The final four words are mealymouthed obscurantism.but it’s just sophistry.Except that it’s not just sophistry. Sophistry is using a mealymouthed qualifier e.g. “as we understand it” when the bare clause is obvious drivel.He has clearly told us there is a difference between right and wrongYou don’t know anything about any creator. Angry egoists and cryptosecularists like you never do, which puts you in good company with rabbis. You’re just citing a literary character as if it were a real, living being and a legitimate source of information. You argue from fake authority.There is no “good” and “evil” independent of God’s fiat.If so, then good and evil originate with willpower exercised capriciously, which is how Shaniqua’s government, too, appears to operate. You’re refusing to trace out the implication of your own dogma. Further, given your assumptions, we can’t truthfully say that the fiat (the acts of declaring this good and that evil) was itself good. Surely the god’s omnipotence implies that it didn’t have to make humans or the world or alleged assistant spirits, nor did it need to declare good and evil by fiat. Notice also that you have ruled out the possibility that the god is good, which I’ve heard is just what the Gnostics believed about the alleged creator of the world. Who knew that you had so much in common with them?You want to be able to judge God, but you can’t.I am judging you, and not just for the battle flag designed under the influence of a Jewish complainer named Charles Moise.

                        Wow. So much to unpack, and probably can’t be done, given your antipathy.“Trinitarianism” is really nothing more than the idea that there are (at least) three distinct aspects of God. If you have even a basic understanding of theBlind men and an elephant – Wikipediait’s not that much of a reach.I get there’s a fetish about Mary’s virgin birth. I agree it may well be stolen from older Mesopotamian legends, but, seriously, no one really cares other than you and maybe a few Catholics. Mary hasn’t been deified, but is simply perceived to be a cut-off man.True that the Bible has been more and less than it is now. The Book of Enoch, for example, was canon before it was expunged, and is the major source of our understanding of angels. Similarly, the Gospel of Peter is the origin of purgatory, yet is no longer canon. Paul (presumably) refers to some scripture that no longer exists to claim that Cain’s offering displeased God.Yes, we have scriptures that did not get proofread by Him, and scriptures that had been proofread by Him that have been memory-holed. So what do we do? Shitcan the whole thing?Your whole anger about the unknown reveals a lot about your character. No one has any idea about why a=GmM/d^2, yet no one gets angry over his ignorance about it. Similarly, I don’t really understand why He thinks gay sex is wrong, but I’m not angry about it. It’s just above my pay grade. Maybe someday I’ll understand it, maybe not, but my ignorance doesn’t affect what is.

                    The Spanish Inquisition wasn’t the theocratic institution most learned in school. Isabella saw the way out of Spain’s money woes in the confiscation of Moorish and Jewish wealth, so petitioned Rome for an inquisition, but keep in mind, appointment of inquisitors was exclusively vested in the Spanish throne, Ferdinand and Isabella at the time.
There may well have been some religious fervor underlying it, but venal corruption is a more than sufficient explanation.

You mean the two groups who had demonstrated hostility to the native people and dominant religion of Spain? The two groups that Spain had fought their way back to self-determination against? The Jews had worked closely in alliance with Moorish Muslims in occupied Spain.
Sounds like a sound move.
Nowadays our government just confiscates wealth of unfavored groups via the tax code.

            IRL. A co-worker of mine regularly traded jokes with another co-worker via company e-mail. One morning he emails a fat woman joke. But, the e-mail app autofill-selects another employee who has the same name, but with a different middle initial. Co-worker does not notice the substitution and clicks ‘send’. That third employee happens to be a high up executive who has a secretary who pre-screens his e-mails. Unfortunately, she is obese. The first co-worker is walked out the door by multiple security guards before the morning is out, and the second is sent to re-education camp.

            The collective will, the supernatural, or a monopoly on violence. In AINO authority resides with the latter.The power structure doesn’t manifest the collective will because Our Democracy is a sham.The power structure is no longer Christian in any meaningful sense, and is probably preponderently atheistic or agnostic. At any rate, its mouthpieces never claim to be acting as divine legates anymore anyway.So, that leaves us with a monopoly on violence, which the power structure does indeed possess. They impose their deranged edicts upon us because they can, and they can annihilate us if we demur. AINO is a postmodern dictatorship.

                    I don’t think you quite appreciate the symbiotic relationship between churches and governments in the old world. They’ve railroaded people, too. They’ve handed heretics over to the civil government for punishment. And remember the stories about how the Catholic priests used to blackmail people with what they said in confession? And then there are the various inquisitions … Institutions have a way of “getting” people who Rock the boat too much.

                            We’ve had prohibition and the anti-abortion nut jobs running amok. That’s going to be the mentality you have to deal with. I think the better way to frame it is to have a secular government that acknowledges God, with Christianity first among equals when it comes to how we order things, but with the understanding that secular interests come first.

        Christian Zionists, millions of them, look to the authority of God, and  they are perfectly fine with banning speech critical of Israel or the Jews, after all the Scofield Bible has drilled it into their heads that Jesus wont come back until the chosen whom are promised the real estate in the middle east rebuild their temple.Christian Zionists are a major problem in America.This theology that is not much more than 100 years old is driving a lot of political disfunction when it comes to Israel and the Jews.

            It’s not so much specifically Zionism as it is Biblical literalism that is the major problem. Zionism is just a subcategory of that literalism.For some reason a lot of people on the right think living under the sorts of fanatics who literally want to end the world to fulfill their particular prophecy is any more appealing than living under the fanatics who crawl out of sewer grates or aloha snackbar the local cafe, but it’s all pretty much the same sort of zealotry, the worst aspects of human faith.Just because the rationalists are wrong about the supremacy of human reason doesn’t mean that pulling a full 180 and adopting blind faith in absurdities is the answer either. Faith is a double edged sword just like reason

            Except for Trump, Christian Zionists utterly dominate the GOP, and even he panders to them. His VP choice will speak volumes about his intentions. Anyone except Tulsi Gabbard (and maybe JD Vance, maybe) will basically signal he is in their pocket. But that may be the price of staying out of prison.I still don’t think they will allow Trump to become president, but they want  him to give a good hand-off to the permanent minority, controlled opposition Republicans, without accidentally empowering any True Right dissidents.(btw, what do you all think of “True Right” as an alternative to Alt-Right or DR? I just came up wit that 🤔)

                I see signs of a Thermidorean Reaction. Not saying it will happen, but they are there.A. Every manager and owner of a hedge fund, real estate firm, and the like knows that they are “next” after Trump — there is no stop sign after him and they want to foreclose that the way Robspierre’s former allies knew they were next.B. The oncoming disaster that is French and UK NATO escalation in Ukraine, requiring massive amounts of US troops locked into WWI plus unless it goes global nuclear war. Russia can rubble most of Western Europe’s cities without nukes while we cannot do the same to Russias without nukes.C. The coming loss of Taiwan and the US Pacific fleet.D. The coming loss of South Korea to the North.E. The collapse of the Green Dream in the realities of actual re-armament which means re-industrialization regardless of what AWFLs want.This is not definitive, but the End of History dream where the US faced no serious military threat is over. Peace is over, if you want it. Real hard war, not the pretend GWOT, requires lots and lots of hard White guys top to bottom to run and win it. No transgenders, black lesbians, and girl bosses need apply.

            Hearing about Christian Zionists and the Scofield Bible has become so tedious that I feel compelled to put the correction somewhere, even though it should be obvious to those who read and believe the Christian Bible.Modern Israel and the assortment of Zionists are people “who say they are Jews and are not” as Jesus said in Revelation 2. They are not Biblical Jews because “Anyone who does not listen to him[Christ] will be completely cut off from their people” as Peter declared in Acts 3 and Paul explained in Romans 2. To paraphrase the latter “A person is not a Jew who is only one outwardly; they must be circumcised in the heart by the Spirit.”This is based on the rebellion against Moses in Numbers 16, where those who rebelled were swallowed whole by the earth, they and their possessions. “They went down alive into the realm of the dead.” Jesus was the prophet who would replace Moses from Deuteronomy 18, who the Jews must follow or God would call them to account.Jesus was not shy about what that would look like in the parable of the Ten Minas and the parable of the Tenants from Luke.This truth is woven throughout the Bible from Moses to Revelation, yet people follow the money and the con men as ever.Judaism is the natural enemy of Christianity because it must deny all the above in order to put forward an illegitimate claim as “illegitimate children”. So-called Christians who align themselves with Zionists dishonor both the Father and the Son. That comes with consequences.

                Interesting thought. I had been an ardent anti-Zionist for several decades, until someone from church asked about it, so I researched it, and found out Zionism is just the idea of creating a Jewish homeland so Jews can GTFO of where they don’t belong.
Are you saying I’m offending God by becoming a Super-Mega Zionist and wanting them all to go screw up their own country?

        Well that is the real hell of it, isn’t it, Z? I can see, clear as day, the blow back that is going to come from jewish censors editing the bible. It is going to be Biblical if they want to get stupid about. In the real world, this is just the Establishment virtue signaling its masters. Pushed to its limits, the question of “who says” will be answered by the cartridge box, not the ballot box. In the real world I suspect the rat faced jewish censors will be largely, but politely, ignored.Westerners are openly contemptuous of theocratic law, but the fact is that there is only one entity that can’t be bought off or blackmailed by Man. Perhaps this hatred of theocratic law is a gift from our (((best friends and allies)))? Say what you want about Sharia Law… but under that system, if you commit crime A, you draw punishment B. To borrow a euphemism… it works that way Every. Single. Time. It doesn’t matter if you are George Soros or Glen Filthie… God’s Will is done in every Sharia court, the judges answer to God almighty and if they don’t – their peers will deal with them. Harshly. You can see why the jews hate the moslems when viewed through this lens. You don’t get retarded black baboons and corrupt jews jamming up national elections with fake lawfare under Sharia law. Obviously Sharia law has it’s flaws and failures but even with them, it is a superior form of law compared to ours at the moment.I was not looking for God when He tripped me and I went face first into a snow bank during an early morning dog walk. I have no problems answering to God or deferring to His judgement. Mind you, I am a harmless old stubfart that keeps to himself and largely minds his manners. You might want to look at the kinds of people that would object to God’s law. The jews, the feminist rage heads, black criminals and welfare monkeys, gays, pedos, etc…perhaps I repeat myself.It won’t be long now. Beeping at orange cars makes as much sense as having jews censor your bible. It ain’t gonna happen and it can only make things worse. Voltaire was right about being ruled by people you can’t criticize and jews are evil, sinful people that are regularly rebuked by God. I will not be hitching my wagon to theirs in this world, thank you very much.

        Remember when the oligarchs looted Russia’s crown jewel assets after the Soviet Union fell apart? Roughly about the same time is when we started to get all of these newly minted Jewish billionaires here in the US. I wonder if there is a connection. Remember, Jeffrey Epstein’s (and his predecessors’) honey traps were also targeting CEOs.

            Russia being the only part of the world that the GAE/British empire never conquered or dominated is something I can’t get out of my head as I watch their campaign against it. Of course as you point at they had their hooks in it for a brief time, only to be excised. Probably makes it all the more maddening for them.

                    When it comes to sex, women inarguably have all the power.All the power.
If Staciey Britt is a slut it is because she wants to be one, and the 95% of Beta Loser men who get zero promiscuous puss are not at fault foranyof this state of affairs. Go tar and feather a Feminist instead. Also, blame those who are actually responsible for the Great Skankening.

                        Nah. Women anymore are seriously damaged goods. They’ve been brought up in a culture that hates them if they even consider chastity and motherhood as an option, instead of pursuing a career. To think women’s locker rooms should be for females only is, at best, to be denounced as a TERF.I meet almost none who, if I were the type, could not be manipulated in any way I chose by abusing their insecurities about, for example, body shape.I get it. Men are screwed up, too. This culture does an excellent job of creating mental cases who deserve each other.

                            All this misses my point: women control access to sex. Full stop. The mental problems of all adults of both sexes is a completely separate question.Blaming men for “sowing their wild oats” is asinine, since men can only do this insofar as women permit it to happen. Ergo, if men (legitimately) complain they are locked out of sexual access due to Feminist Slut Culture, it is ridiculous to blame men because there are no decent marriage partners to be had.And to the point you make about mental instability, we have now had 3 generations of children raised by parents damaged by the Feminist war on the family.And so I will reiterate: go tar and feather a Feminist. She will deny all responsibility, but we know better.

        Who says? Important question. Especially relevant with the GOP. A partial list of things they never swung into action on includes:
Millions per year marching across the border then living at taxpayer expense
Children urged to mutilate their bodies
The 2020 election being stolen
Antifa burning down cities while BLM looted businesses
Jan 6 protestors being tortured through years of solitary confinement
But let Jews be criticized and the GOP is there for the rescue
Unfortunately the answer to who says makes people on both sides of the divide very uncomfortable

        There are still a lot of religious people in the US, and a great many in Congress claim to be religious. So I think God’s judgment is still in people’s heads, and if pressed, they would invoke scripture, or at least a “He gets us” understanding of Christianity.
In the US, God has not been replaced. What has been replaced is authoritarian Christianity for Christian playacting that favors non-judgment and radical acceptance on the assumption that Christ was really just a nice guy who wants to be your friend.

            Indeed, one could say that leftists in government are the most Christian of all, based on the parts of scripture they have picked and chosen to emphasize (last shall be first and first shall be last etc.). Building on Matthew 19:21, they are intent on giving away their entire civilization to the poor. In this sense they bring Christian theology into government with a force that the right never has.

            I would argue that just like Our Democracy, the ostensible Christianity of our rulers is largely grub for Grillers. Ol’ Martha and Merle out in Moline want to believe their politicians are god-fearing Christians just like them. And the politicians tell them just that. But they haven’t cracked a Bible since they were 14 and any of their prayers are as apt to go to Geryon as God.

                Yeah, I’ve noticed since Clinton and his “well used” Bible show, even the pretense of belief has gone out the window for politicians.  When I was younger, the news media would make great effort to publicize Presidential worship attendance.  Presidents would make it a habit to visit different local churches and be filmed. Obama came along and dropped that immediately.  Trump?  Biden?
The show is over.  It was all for the rubes anyway, nonetheless I morn for the country.

                        The point is that once upon a time it was shown/thought to be a believer in good standing was essential.  Now almost no politician believes such and in that we see the degrading/elimination of religion’s importance in our nation.  We are now seeing the effect of such writ large.

                I have mixed feelings on that. I’m not the most Church going person myself, but that stuff was taught to me when I was young and I believe in it at a high level, though not necessarily at the detail level. That’s good enough for me. There’s nothing in the Bible that says you have to go to church every Sunday or that you even have to read the Bible. Remember, most of our ancestors were illiterate.

                    There are exceptions, of course, but most devout Christians read the Bible and go to church. That’s sort of baseline piety. If you don’t do this, it’s a pretty good indicator you don’t take your Christianity very seriously.

        I have a couple of neighbors who fall into the “Christian Zionists”  category.   It has been great fun for me to drop various bible verses on them.   It is also funny to see the contortions they go through to explain Israel’s barbaric behavior.   I asked them yesterday, So it is OK that Netanyahu potentially tried to start WWII by bombing a consulate in Syria?   The dumfounded looks are priceless.Be that as it may, now in the year of our Lord 2024, it is clear to all but the true retards, who is running the show in America and really the entire West.

        I’m old enough to remember when everyone on the right said Rubio was the next “outsider” who was going to take on the system.
Then Trump. Then Hawley. Some even told me Johnson as of not too long ago.
Until you realize that the entire “outsider” narrative, from Musk to MTG to Milo to Vox to whoever is next, is a ruse, you’ll start to see what’s going on here.

        “In the end, the response to all new demands for censorship and prohibitions against thoughts or actions must be “Who says?” Who decided that being rude to Jewish people is the worst sin? When was this decided? Who says we have to pretend crime is not what it is? Unless and until the scolds can answer these basic questions of authority, they have no legitimacy.”But they do have an answer to this question of who says.  The answer is criticism of Israel leads to criticism of Jews which leads to antisemitism which leads to nazis which leads to another 6 million or slavery or some other ill defined evil.Putting aside the nasty anti-White bigotry which permeates the culture, we have a giant cult around “anti-racism.”  The vast majority are true believers in anti-racism with a special exemption for anti-White hate.

        Re-Reading Bros. K now.  Last summer’s re-read was Demons by Dostoyevsky. Two incredible novels that are every bit as relevant now as they were over 150y ago.  The idea (not quote per se) that you mention – “IfGod does not exist, then everything is permitted”, is attributed to Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov, the sensualist second son of the buffoon, Pyotor Karamazov.Yes, without the higher authority of God, man becomes the true master of his moral universe…. or so he thinks. About 100 years later (1978), another great Russian writer, Solzhenitsyn, again made this claim that the West was spiraling into the same trap that the Russians fell under through the Bolsheviks – Godlessness.  AINO, the Anglosphere, and W Europe have now pretty much been captured by the same ((alien)) crowd that took over Russia some 100y ago.  When will we ever learn from history?  Maybe when history is finally taught after/if the  aliens are finally defeated.  That’s the only solution.

        I’m not sure nature grants any rights to anything.  Humans that manage to create any sort of civilization, primitive or advanced, first must agree on a set of rules and or boundaries in order for that civilization to work.  It sounds good to say natural right, as if said right is something guaranteed beyond the power of mankind.I may have the right to free speech, but the G can silence me.  I might have the right to bear arms, but the G can still take them from me.  Nature does not intervene and has nothing to do with it.Rights are those things that an individual can act upon without infringing upon the actions of another.  Me speaking my mind or defending myself does not require any other to take action.However, things like education and health care are not rights, simply because those things require – require – some other person to provide them at some cost.  If a person can teach them selves to read, great, they have a right to teach themselves how to do anything.  But no one has a right to force someone else to do something for them, whether it is educating them or healing them or protecting them.  That is servitude, whether it’s voluntary or forced.The dishonesty becomes apparent when those demanding/forcing your services attach a standard of morality to their demand.Education, protection, health care – those are privileges that are the result of an advanced society who has first provided its own rules and boundaries.

            I think a more correct way to put it is that the rules co-evolve with the civilization. Whatever flaw appears spawns a rule to address it, and civilization plays out under the new ruleset. Each new rule is put in place to address a specific unintended consequence of the previous ruleset.And that’s why a culture cannot just have any old ruleset imposed on it and hope for the best. African culture does not work with European rules because Africans have a different set of social norms and expectations. I’m fine with saying it’s an inferior culture, but if Africa wants to be Africa, I have no problems with it. I just despise anyone trying to turn America into Africa.

        Stephen Steinlight of the Center for Immigration Studies (cis.org/Steinlight), who was previously National Affairs Director at the American Jewish Committee (AJC) for eight years, warned American Jews back in 2001 that the unlimited open borders policies they were promoting essentially ubiquitously as a community would likely result in summoning a tribal-based non-white golem that would turn on them. He recommended a reconsideration of these policies toward much less immigration as well as much increased assimilation. He was of course ignored.Here’sthe 2001 article.Now there is a clash on the intersectional pyramid: who is more of a victim, Jews because of the Holocaust or non-white Muslims because they are brown and not Christian?  It is an intra-leftist dispute based around who is more of a victim.  In my opinion the Muslims will ultimately win because Jews are more or less white looking and undeniably privileged, and the Muslims have extremely high tribalism and high birthrates in addition to the intersectionality bonus.Regardless, Christians should just stay out of the dispute and advocate withdrawal from the region entirely as arguedhere.

        Great post, Z. Allow me to weigh in on this for a bit.Ever since Aristotle, there has been a distinction between natural law and conventional law. Whether we drive on the left or the right side of he road, or stop on a yellow light instead of green, is purely law by convention. It really does not matter which we choose so long as everyone does the same thing for the sake of consistency, efficiency, and avoiding confusion. There are a lot of mundane conventional decisions made by government like that. Does the DMV require that your registration sticker go on your tag, or your windshield? Meh. Same-same. The world, as they say, does not revolve around it.Natural law, on the other hand, is based upon the principles that nature (or nature’s God, if you will) imposes upon man. The fact that man is a mammalian species that reproduces sexually and male and female each contribute half the DNA to the offspring is a fact of Nature. Laws mandating heterosexual marriage should be obvious — indeed unnecessary, Defy natural law and you will pay a price — if you refuse to have heterosexual intercourse, your species will go extinct.  But in fact laws based on Nature ARE necessary, because all people do not comprehend or follow Nature’s laws, or because there is a significant lag between defying Nature and paying the price for it.This is why Plato recommended governance by philosopher-kings, who were trained in ascertaining these natural truths. Unfortunately, it never (or rarely) came to fruition.Hobbes squared this circle by arguing that the only Law of Nature was for man to create a government, which then had the total power to impose law, whether by pure convention or not.And that is where we are at today. We are governed by a Hobbesian Leviathan that has decided it will impose a pro-Zionist position and punish any anti-Zionist sentiment. natural law might argue that people naturally have the right to free speech, or that Israel is an insignificant nation that provides no benefits and many liabilities to the United States, but none of that matters. Our Hobbesian Leviathan has issued a decree, and that is that.Nature will eventually have the final say. We cannot give money to Israel (while we’re $34 trillion in debt) indefinitely without going broke. Israel cannot continue to slaughter children indefinitely without some blowback for it and the U.S. (The 9/11 attacks were part of this blowback. Can anyone seriously argue that they would have happened had it not been for our patronage of Israel?) Voters cannot indefinitely remain quiescent about defending Israel’s border but not out own.Like juggling, Nature’s gravity will eventually cause you to drop a plate and shatter it. it is only a matter of time. In the meantime, the answer is for our Hobbesian government to employ ever more repression.

        The unspoken truth is that there is a civil war among Western (((peoples))). Those who are “non-fancy” like Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb and others on Wall Street see the University agitation aimed directly at their kids and aimed at removing their kids, nephews, friends kids from University spots which are valuable and feed into Goverment/NGO positions of great power and eventually targeting them. “Fancy” people including Soros, and people like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, the CIA, State Dept, are funding and organizing the protests which are spiraling ever bigger in the hopes of creating a crisis that will authorize a total Color Revolution which has been the successful playbook abroad up to now.This bill is aimed at the Fancies by the non-Fancies as part of a neo-Thermidorean reaction**. HOWEVER …It has a poison pill in that it outsources the definition of badness to the ADL and $PLC which will reliably label the Bible, the Cross, Christians, Christmas, Easter, etc. as badness and screaming Aloha Snackbar Rageboys as “nothing to see here, move along” as these guys are aligned with the Fancies.It would be expanded anyway as the FBI uses definitions from the $PLC and ADL in defining and prosecuting crimes, this just takes if from Administrative Law to Legislative Law (there is really no difference in practice between the EFFECTS of the two branches).I don’t really know what the effect will be? Alienate Christians as it used to burn/ban the Bible, Christian services, Christmas and Easter while pushing Eid and other stuff ? Maybe? Will it be used against the spiraling protests and possibly against the Fancies and their cash hoards and organizers? Maybe, though probably not. Will Muslims force Biden to veto the bill? Its possible. Will its failure promote a greater alliance among the non-Fancies with Dirt People? Don’t know.But the move from “shadow” Administrative Law that outsources definitions of crimes to whatever an NGO says into formal Legislative moves was always coming — I’m surprised frankly it took this long.**There are not many slots in Wall Street, Higher Ed, NGOs, Government etc. that have not already been purged of Straight White Males which is why you see the demonstrations filled with: AWFLs, mystery meat indeterminate genders, lots of Lesbians of Color, and strangely very few Islamic Rage Boys. It seems the Islamic Rage Boys are not interested in the higher end of things but their women decidely are. Being focused on the jobs and money of people like Bill Ackman they are a threat the way some jihadi in Nashville is not.

            I can’t shake off the sense that the Big Jews are making an alliance with the Orange Man. In which case the only thing they’re color revolutioning against with these protests is the Biden regime. Certainly I can see no other target. Then after he’s installed, and the big financial crisis/GD 2.0 happens, he gets the blame and “maga” is marginalized for a half century minimum, as the America First movement of the 1930s was.
It’s tricky, because the TDS on the “left” is so far gone that it can’t be totally controlled

        “Who says we should ban criticism of Israel?”
God’s chosen people said so. One could say that some republicans buy into the “chosen people” myth. If they are God’s chosen people, and they say we can’t criticize them, then the authority is God. It’s not much different from the old belief of the King being put in power by God, and his authority deriving from such.

            Sometimes they’ve been called the least self-aware people in the history of the world. They always are asking themselves “Is it good for the Jews?” In-group preference is a good survival trait. Apparently what has escaped their notice is that once they have gained centers of power their continued preference for their own kind at some point becomes a harm, alienating the out group. This tends to work out very badly for all concerned especially for the Jews.

If “Chosen people” refers to merely people who try to live their lives as He says they should…

        The problem goes away if you have a national god. God’s will and the general will are basically the same thing. That has its own problems, like seeing other nations as Amalek.
If your god is universal, you twist yourself in knots over the self/other distinction and end up committing suicide.
Or you can split the difference and maintain yourself while being tolerant of the other. Some Pagans were able to do this, but it seems like we’re too stupid to do it today.

            For the record, I’m not an advocate of returning to paganism. That’s long ago, and it seems to me a question of people.Zealous people in faith or rebellion. Thinking Exodus. Yahweh wants to crush his people for being rebellious and Moses talks him out of it(!). He gives Moses the Law to give to them instead. So now there’s a Law to keep and a form (just read Numbers lol)— the beginning of an inward turning that culminates in the crisis of Jesus’ time. Some rebel again, others take refuge in a spiritual circumcision.So now the faith could spread to the Gentiles. It adapted to us, as we adapted to it, and it thrived. Until we became more or less wholly Christian, at which point the faith started to re-Hebraize itself. We aren’t so zealous, I think, or at least there are limits to our zealotry.(Call Protestants judaizers or satanists, we share blame. But Protestantism is a symptom not the cause imo.)Anyway, my point is we tempered the thing, by our nature, which is why it thrived, as we thrived by the Truth. Hence making Christianity more pagan again. Just my opinion!

I think this anti racism multi cultural thing swept in at a very specific time: post wwii. I just don’t see how god has always meant for the races to be mixed up . Either he separated the races which is a perfectly acceptable interpretation of the curse of ham, or evolution seperated the races . Racial differences should be respected. Africa. An be Christian in their way and whites in theirs, how is that wrong? There was English and Spanish Catholicism which was very distinct.St. Augustine on Galatians 3:28:Difference of race or condition or sex is indeed taken away by the unity of faith, but it remains imbedded in our mortal interactions, and in the journey of this life the apostles themselves teach that it is to be respected, and they even proposed living in accord with the racial differences between Jews and Greeks as a wholesome rule.

                    I’m with you on that. I think— and I’m not a theologian— it’s important to remember that Jesus was preaching to the Hebrews. It was a focused message. The Great Commission fell to His followers, who were in a completely different situation, and they successfully translated the message and dealt with an international faith.Once wholly Christian, I imagine there’s less need to translate and appeal, plus people will start looking for a ‘pure’ or ‘true’ Christianity, and Jesus’ Hebrew-specific message would be the obvious place to start. Add to this literacy and the printing press (the Protestant contribution), the scattering of Israel, etc., and you can see how things could get mixed up. Here we are.

                Millstones and lakes aside, have you considered the possibility that the OT is not meant to be taken literally, that to a large degree, it’s parables. much as the NT?Almost self-evidently, the Garden of Eden is a parable. So why isn’t Abram merely the story of the abandonment of Fertile Crescent’s practice of human sacrifice? The story is not about Abram’s literal descendants, but his spiritual descendants, those who reject human sacrifice as atonement?Reading the stories as figurative rather than literal makes most of the OT make at least some sense. Not that I’m pushing for those who are not spiritually in a place to make sense of Him being upset about people worshiping Him, rather than live their lives as He implores, but, still…

        I’m pretty sure that for the majority, to include most of the clouds and wannabe clouds (especially the latter), the question of who says is settled by what The Man On TV says. For practical purposes, the true voice of god. We are talking about a “people” who are that easily ruled.
I have no doubt whatsoever that if the dissident right gained control of the media and propagated an anti jewish message, we’d have most everybody singing right along in under 5 years.

                I never listened to enough Rush to say where he was on that. But certainly he was never “dissident right.” That show was about as Reagan Rebublican as they come. Which I deduce from my friend Civnat G. Normiecon who loved it and listened all the time.

        “The answer to the question of “Who says?” is “the government says so” but that is not adequate because who says the government has the right to police your opinions? The only possible answer to that question is us, the people, and no such authority has been granted.”Maybe, once upon a time. But for some time now the government has depended on its monopoly on armed force to do what it wants. The acquiescence — even of a sullen and begrudging sort — of the governed to the whims and caprices of a bought and corrupt government no longer matters.At the way things are going even to dream something vaguely “anti-semitic” will become a “dream crime.” But first will come face “face crime” and “thought crime.”But this is what happens in a country where whites will soon be a minority and one where it is essentially owned and governed lock, stock, and barrel by Jews, with goyim thralls in the White House and Congress. The rest of the world — outside Europe and Japan — looks on and wets itself silly.

        The problem with “Says Who” when it comes to government is that it is completely arbitrary.  Bureaucrat X writes the regulation one way, Bureaucrat Y comes in and changes the name of it to “leave his mark”, confuses the hell out of everyone, and gets people in trouble with the law for no reason.  Or, because he wants to get somebody in trouble with the law.“Says who” is what has Trump withstanding 4-5 different prosecutions.  Most of the things he’s accused of aren’t even crimes.  The others are made-up crimes concocted as a means to indict him because there weren’t any ACTUAL LAWS they could use.“Says who” means that the next election is about whether the people currently being allowed to make shit up at random in order to jail their enemies will be allowed to continue doing so.  I suspect there are many millions of fake votes lined up to ensure this outcome.

        In a better world, some of those alleged patriotic types in the “Intelligence Community” would band together and false flag sarin the Knesset, then false flag a massive Israeli response gas attack on Gaza. Then maybe there would be a sufficient majority to say, “Enough. All Jews self deport to your homeland or suffer the consequences.” Something, anything for America First to be something other than hate speech.Then we could maybe follow it up with common sense reforms. (Can’t figure out how to start numbering from 4, but you get the point.)None but members of the nation may be citizens of the state. None but those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. No Jew, therefore, may be a member of the nation.Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest and must be regarded as being subject to foreign laws.The right of voting on the state’s government and legislation is to be enjoyed by the citizen of the state alone. We demand therefore that all official appointments, of whatever kind, shall be granted to citizens of the state alone. We oppose the corrupting custom of parliament of filling posts merely with a view to party considerations, and without reference to character or capability.We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to nourish the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) must be excluded from the Reich.All immigration of non-Germans must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since 2 August 1914, be required immediately to leave the Reich.

Putting aside the humorous nature of taking their boomboxes, this is just flat out evil. He should be arrested and or deported for even making such threats.  He can take all the foreign antisemites with him.

        Serious question. Why isn’t everyone here a Zionist? What exactly is the problem with a Jewish homeland, then insisting Jews return to their homeland?

                I’m not talking about who has “right” to the property. Obviously, we all (or at least most of us) think conquest of the American Indians sufficient claim to  the land.
But what would be the grounds for telling Jews to go back to their homeland if they had no homeland?
Don’t dodge the question. How can this be addressed without “colonization”, which is clearly OK in the case of North America?

        ”Beep every time you see an orange car.” Interesting choice of color Z. Substitute Beep your horns every time you see an “orange man! 😂Marco Rubio owes his political career, and thus his luxurious lifestyle, to a Zionist billionaire car dealer named Norman Braman. Rubio has been in the pocket of the neocons his entire career.
No one financed Donald J Trump’s political career!Another reason he’s the best candidate for president!

        Many readers of this blog have heard of a Jewish doctor named Vladimir Zelenko (b. 1973, supposedly in Kiev). He became notorious for prescribing a combo of drugs including hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19. Few know, however, that he was a thirsty Noahide, too.A young nationalist named Adam Green has done yeoman’s work calling attention to this cult, which many Jews and others hope to impose on the world. Here’sa short videowhich Green published of Zelenko explaining how things will work for criminals as they will be defined in the statutes and case law of creationist Zionocracy, which can still be distinguished from the Zionocracy preferred by David Ben-Gurion.Chabad has publisheda version of the Noahide laws, and you can see that they aren’t 100% wrong. The 4th, for example, will be very popular among people who love living dogs, cats, cows, horses, fishes and so on. Zionocracy will be supported by many millions of fools who aren’t even sons of Ya’akov.Much of the cult’s expected power depends upon blind faith in a big flood which never happened, and in a tall tale about some guy who built a big boat for his family and unhuman animals to live in during the flood. Geology and mythology have knocked down the fable, so expect some bossy people to wage a long war on the “Antisemitism” of geology and mythology. The degradation of academic standards in the West will be very useful to this end, and of course lower class believers will be organized into armed death squads to impose Noahidism on hesitant nations and their leaders. The Z Man and his idolatrous friend, Andrew Torba, are with the degraders and the death squads already, which is ironic given their complaining about﻿﻿H.R. 6090.

        The question “Who says?” has literally nothing to do with the topic under consideration in this post. This is just Z-Man trying to shoehorn contemporary events into the Procrustean Bed of his own bizarre terminology. Since “Who says?” is something of anidée fixewith him, he seeks to trot it out on any possible occasion. The sentiment itself is not germane to any kind of legal, political, or ethical discussion. It’s just a pure bit of stridency, a diffident posture designed to trick people into prescinding from thesubstantialpoint at hand and involve them in a fruitless argument about authority. You might say that Z-Man’s entireoeuvrehas simply been the Taylor Expansion of this refractory pose. “The Diffident Right,” it should be called.First Taylor Polynomial:“Who Says?”Second Taylor Polynomial:“You can’t make me, neener neener neener!”Third Taylor Polynomial:♫You don’t own meI’m not just one of your many toysYou don’t own meDon’t say I can’t go with other boysAnd don’t tell me what to doAnd don’t tell me what to say…♫Fourth Taylor Polynomial:“Welcome to episode ### of the Z-Blog Power Hour. I am the host and sole proprietor of  The Z-Blog, which can be found at thezman.com. Before we begin, a friendly reminder that you can now support my work with more than just your enthusiasm. Listener enthusiasm is not accepted at the bank. So, if you like what you hear, consider kicking in a few bucks to the cause…”Furthermore, the idea that all claims to speak authoritatively will reduce either to the supernatural or to a group consensus is one of the most vacuous and ridiculous things I’ve ever heard said. On a practical, day-to-day level, almost nothing is ever claimed on the basis of such authority. The overwhelming majority of externally imposed orders are issued to us in the name of the institutions to which we belong: workplaces, boards, counties, cities, nations, etc. These groups all have properly constituted authorities who are entitled to speak for them. Consensus is not required to legitimate the orders of a superior, or no one would be able to rule; and gods need not be consulted on matters that are left open to prudential human judgment. Anyone who believes that people only feel an imperative in response to gods are groups is testifying to his own preference for mindless automatism and his refusal to accept the demands of personal responsibility.

            Why can’t you just make your point without being a rude asshole? A normal person could quickly rewrite your comment, eliminating the calc III nonsense, replacing the pretentious ‘prescinding from’ with ‘overlooking’, weeding out the gratuitous condescension, and focusing on your point, which isn’t a bad one. Institutions carry a non-consensual authority in that a participant accedes to that authority without examining and voting on the many rules – both stated and unstated – that inhere within that institution, be it a church, a legal code, a military tradition, a language, the customs of everyday life (like good manners – hint hint), and even basic things like diet and hygiene. It’s called culture.

                Thanks. Believe it or not, this “rude asshole” is just me. It’s not an affectation, it’s really how I communicate. I’m sure if you met me in real life, I would not come across as rude at all. I say the things I say without rancor. This is why I intend to put out a video when I have some time. It really helps to see a person’s face, hear their voice, and observe their mannerisms to get a sense of their personality.

            It all comes from the “consent of the governed,” (even the gods) at least in a very vague way.  This is why the state controls schooling and mass communications.Do you really think it is a mystery why pictures of dead presidents were all around the top of the perimeter of your first few grades of school?If we were still invoking the gods and their representatives in human society, the first few grades would really drive home how the gods wisely chose the king and his bureaucrats to lead us to a godly society.  But instead, it’s all about how these institutions have power, but that we gave them power based on what we know is good, as defined by your earlier lesson you got last period and what you saw on teevee last night.  It’s all very circular.  It’s good and this is why we do it.  We know it’s good because we just told you why it’s good.  Plus, you are able to articulate in your own words why it is good, just like we taught you, so it is therefore self-evidently good.

        How did you come to the following conclusion?For most of human history, the answer to the question, “Who says?” has been God, maybe the gods or perhaps a holy many who everyone agrees has some connection to the gods.That claim requires evidence, but it appears ridiculous to anyone who is familiar with Vedic religion, Jainism, and Buddhism. You won’t find solid support in Taoism or Confucianism, either. These systems have concepts of the supernatural, or at least the supermundane, but it doesn’t follow that fiat is the foundation of their morality. Your authoritarian bias—which appears to be extremely Shemitic—is only too clear in this post.Now, here’s another dubious claim:An unjust prohibition [esp. against criticizing Jews] is no prohibition at all, but merely an invitation to social conflict to the benefit of outsiders.Well, how do you know that it’s “unjust” per se to criminalize criticism against Jews, Levites, and so on? Who says? Likes and dislikes don’t count here. Maybe you just deserve to live in a world in which ZOGbots crack the skulls ofsomepeople who say mean things about the dirty, rotten sons of Ya’akov. The long term trend indicates that “white” Trinitarian Americans have it coming, and it’s fun to watch and hear ganders honking in protest that a sauce good for geese, as ganders see things, is to be poured over the ganders’ flesh, too.We will see shortly, within a decade probably, that the answer to “who says?” will be answered with “HaShem”. This will push and pull our thoughts toward a pseudoscience called theology and its many excuses for creationist superstition. Zionocracy will seek, therefore, to criminalize scepticism, refutations of Zionist theology, and even criticism of egoism (Shemot 3:14). Christians who complain today about Israel persecuting Christians have been carrying water for their masters all along.
