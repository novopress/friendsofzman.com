        “I know, I know. That’s mean spirited of me, but what can I say? I’m an asshole that way.”
That’s one of the reasons I read your blog.
I’m sick of hearing from the eternally nice crowd in conservative circles.  While I applaud taking the high road, we are now threatened from all sides by authoritarianism, entitlement mentality, and batshit crazy.  Time for “nice” is over.
