        The NBA is interesting because it may hold some clues about where things are going. In the 1970’s, the NBA was a mess. The league was about as popular as women’s soccer. In the 80’s they hit gold with Bird and Magic. Both men were great players from a technical perspective, but they were great personalities too. On the cusp of the media explosion, that last bit turned out to be gold.The trouble came when those two aged off. The league tried to rally around Jordan, but one guy winning all the time is dull. TV ratings began to slide. They then decided to embrace hip-hop and changed the rules to make the game more “street” and more “authentic.” The resulting disaster lead to several work stoppages and many franchises either in bankruptcy or close to it.There’s something of a disconnect going on right now. An American oligarch overpaid for the Clippers in order to throw out the seedy heretic. A Russian oligarch finances a team in New York that hemorrhages money. The league just signed a TV deal that allegedly pays them billions. This while core interest in the sport is shrinking.Something does not add up. The sporting press slobbers over basketball and talks about baseball dying. Yet, baseball has five times the revenue and is vastly more profitable. It is a sport played by normal looking people and enjoyed by normal people. Basketball is played by space aliens and becoming a form of polo. Instead of rich people cheering for horses, they are cheering for giant black guys.

        I dunno.  In the US, plenty of middle aged dudes play half court basketball well into middle age. I was playing in flag football leagues into my mid-thirties until I started to lose my speed. I think both sports remain accessible to the masses, but not as much as softball. Maybe it’s a generational thing still in the US, but I still see a lot more middle aged dudes playing half-court basketball than I see playing metric football.

        “It was like a scene out of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” Two immensely wealthy Jews, key financiers of the main political parties of the world’s superpower, discussing how to wage war on the enemies of the Jews, and control the media and presidents.” — Haaretz israeli newspaper.

        Piss on basketball. Now, if it was changed so that it was a sort of full contact basketball, where you oculd legally knock somebody on their ass, it might be worth watching.

        I freely admit that, while I was raised on soccer (and think rugby is a vastly overrated game), I do like watching gridiron. The NFL has made inroads into showing the game in the UK, which is interesting from a marketing pout of view and the proportion of both US fans and those from mainland Europe willing to come to London to watch a regular season game. I admit equally I watch it to see if there are any white wide receivers or running backs or for that matter black offensive linemen, because these things interest me.But basketball I do not get. Perhaps because I am white and can’t jump (and am not over 6 feet tall) it all seems to be a bit weird to me. As far as I can see if you are over 7 feet tall and can draw breath on your own you are likely to find place in the sport. I also do not understand why, it seems if ever happen to see a clip of it on TV, running backwards into someone gets you the benefit of a foul. In most sports, it is usually the other way round. No, please don’t try to explain it because I still won’t watch the game. Slam dunk all you want but seeing someone swinging on a hoop of metal doesn’t impress me.On the other hand I like this type of review of what’s happening in the sport because it becomes a measure of the collapse of integrity and the imposition of cult love in the modern world. Keep it up.

        I’m not American but my impression is that only Football (your type) is popular in America, Basketball is a sport of Blacks and Baseball of Latinos and Hockey is Canadian.
But the guys who play your Football are also a bunch of freaks, FIFA Football is the sport of normal People around the world.
