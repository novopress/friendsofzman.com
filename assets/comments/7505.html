        What passes for political “conservatives” in the press today is like pornography, it isn’t real.

            Look at Kathleen Parker, who regularly represents the “conservative” side on TV and op-ed pages even though she’s endorsed the Democratic candidate for president in two out of the last three elections, counting this one.  MSM content schedulers love pulling that bait &amp; switch, where the veneer of opposing perspectives is presented even though the substance is a wall of beltway establishment conformity.

        The demand/desire for sensible, trustworthy opinion and analysis is great. Always will be. Z-man describes the collapse of the existing rotten system, but modestly fails to note that he himself, like Whittle, Fernandez, Steyn, and others, appear to be among the brilliant phoenixes rising from the ashes. More power to you Z-man! May your readership grow exponentially in the coming months and years.

        Just what are these clown “conserving” but their rice bowls?Think any of them give a shit about any of us? Ever see any of them write about something like what this really pissed of lady has to say on FaceBook? And good on her!“Not sure if facebook will delete me after posting this or not…but, so be it. The following is a message I received this morning as a forward in my email……It will be interesting to hear YOUR thoughts as well!One Pissed off womanI don’t think ‘pissed’ really covers it!!!!Alan Simpson, the former Senator from Wyoming, calls senior citizens the ‘Greediest Generation’ as he compared “Social Security” to a Milk Cow with 310 million teats.Here’s a response in a letter from PATTY MYERS in Montana … I think she is a little ticked off! She also tells it like it is!…………………………………………………………………………….Hey, Alan, let’s get a few things straight!!!!!1. As a career politician, you have been on the public dole (tit) for FIFTY YEARS.2. I have been paying Social Security taxes for 48 YEARS (since I was 15 years old. I am now 63).3. My Social Security payments, and those of millions of other Americans, were safely tucked away in ‘an interest bearing account’ for decades until you political pukes decided to raid the account and give OUR money to a bunch of losers in return for votes, thus bankrupting the system and turning Social Security into a Ponzi scheme that would make Bernie Madoff proud.4. Recently, just like Lucy and Charlie Brown, you and “your ilk” pulled the proverbial football away from millions of American seniors nearing retirement and moved the goalposts for full retirement from age 65 to age, 67. NOW, you and your “shill commission” are proposing to move the goalposts YET AGAIN.5. I, and millions of other Americans, have been paying into Medicare from day one, and now “you” propose to change the rules of the game. Why? Because “you” mismanaged other parts of the economy to such an extent that you need to steal our money from Medicare to pay the bills.6. I, and millions of other Americans, have been paying income taxes our entire lives, and now you propose to increase our taxes yet again. Why? Because you “incompetents” spent our money so profligately that you just kept on spending even after you ran out of money. Now, you come to the American taxpayers and say you need more to pay off YOUR debt.To add insult to injury, you label us “greedy” for calling “bullshit” to your incompetence. Well, Captain Bullshit, I have a few questions for YOU:1. How much money have you earned from the American taxpayers during your pathetic 50-year political career?2. At what age did you retire from your pathetic political career, and how much are you receiving in annual retirement benefits from the American taxpayers?3. How much do you pay for YOUR government provided health insurance?4. What cuts in YOUR retirement and healthcare benefits are you proposing in your disgusting deficit reduction proposal, or as usual, have you exempted yourself and your political cronies?5. It is you, Captain Bullshit, and your political co-conspirators called Congress who are the “greedy” ones.6. It is you and your fellow thieves who have bankrupted America and stolen the American dream from millions of loyal, patriotic taxpayers. And for what? Votes, your job and retirement security at our expense.7. That’s right, sir. You and yours have bankrupted America for the sole purpose of advancing your political careers. You know it, we know it, and you know that we know it.8. And you can take that to the bank.NO, I did not stutter.P.S. And stop calling Social Security benefits “entitlements”. WHAT AN INSULT!!!!I have been paying into the SS system for 48 years. It’s my money-give it back to me the way the system was designed and stop patting yourself on the back like you are being generous by doling out these monthly checks.EVERYONE!!! If you like the way things are in America delete this.If you agree with what a Montana citizen, Patty Myers says, please PASS IT ON.

        Pretty good insight into the collapse of the pornocracy. As an editor and publisher for Penthouse and someone who ran Penthouse.com for a year or two that’s generally right on the money.  Add in the bullgoose lunacy of Hefner (speed) and Guccione (diet coke) and you’ve got it.Back in 1993 I wrote in the first issue of Wired:“The point here is that all media, when they are either new enough or become relatively affordable, are used by outlaws to broadcast unpopular images or ideas. When a medium is created, the first order of business seems to be the use of it in advancing religious, political, or sexual notions and desires. Indeed, all media, if they are to get a jump-start in the market and become successful, must address themselves to mass drives – those things we hold in common as basic human needs.”As some wag put it very early on, “Libertarianism is the deep fuel source of the Internet and from time to time it must return there to feed.”

            The early days of the internet were not so much libertariansim as simply a safe place for normal males to be normal males. I don’t think we truly appreciate just how feminized the culture has become in the last forty years or so. All of these insane fads like trannies in the bathrooms are driven by spiteful young women looking for a reason to harass men. Every time some poor bastard is hauled out in chains for crime think, the accuser is a white woman.This did not happen overnight. In the 80’s we were marched off to sensitivity training and then diversity training in the 90’s. Back then, the internet was where you could say what the bleep you wanted without having to worry about the nags in HR waging a finger at you. It’s so out of hand now, I think that’s why were seeing this huge backlash.

                My late husband was raised Catholic. He used to say the the nuns were bitter because they weren’t allowed to have children. Maybe we have underestimated what happens when you pervert the natural impulses towards motherhood.

        Red pill, however minute, is the only political movement that is alive with curiosity. If the internet is a room, the last time this many inquisitive skeptics met was in Philadelphia, with a special blessing to the anti-federalists. There was a fire, and it was of their own making. They put it out. These are not, as is often said, interesting times, but if they are coming they are red pill.

        Good analysis, but you don’t quite cover why, for example, Talk radio is still a huge profit center and why new conservative online aggregators / sites are growing.If your hypothesis was strictly accurate, then Rush’s audience would be dwindling, local talk radio would be gone, other national talkers (Hannity, Ingram) would be marginalized, and online content like The Imaginative Conservative and Taki’s Mag would disappear in favor of straight blogs.But I do think you are on a fertile trail. I think you have to add in a growing conservative base that are more educated, well read, and still seek thought leaders to conceptualize and distill (like Buckley, et al). Add in that libertarians and independents are finding common ground with conservatives (via Conquest’s 1st Law), and you are close.

            Bo’s own audience lapped him ten or fifteen years ago. His numbers didn’t drop because he engendered a tremendous loyalty. I tend to think his presence has crowded out new talent. Hannity is a drone. There is an audience for drones, but it is not growing. Levin is interesting, but he thinks we are going to talk our way out of this.There is no red pill on the airwaves. Commercial and government interest would not, and have not, permitted it. People in the main have literally never heard it, and are shocked if they do. It’s like porn in the old days. You have to go looking for it.

        I don’t get SE Cupp. Yeah, she does the “sexy librarian” bit and she spells her name to evoke “c-cup,” but she appears to be talentless. Way back when Glenn Reynolds was flogging her, I read a couple of her opeds and they were devoid of anything resembling insightful thought. Every time her name pops up, I’m amazed she’s still around.

            I’ve never quite grasped the lack of self-awareness. An axiom in show business is “there’s no dignity in show business.” If you are going to put a show for the folks, you will eventually be required to make a fool of yourself. She is more than willing to play the boozy bimbo role on TV, yet she gets offended when not taken seriously. At the same time, these people like to mix it up with the prols on-line, then get miffed when the prols don’t toady to the TV stars.

                Having seen you mention her several times, I finally looked up this S.E. Cupp person. I thought about reading one of her columns, but then I saw her Problem Glasses.  How horribly sexist of me.  Shouldn’t she be over at Salon.com, telling us why it’s true conservatism that Heather has two mommies?

        Yes, getting the truth, and fearless opinion pieces, for free on line is a lot better than paying for lies and bought opinions on TV. If there’s going to be a revolution it will come when big government tries to control online content.

        Everyone probably has their pron tales, possibly even admit it, but mine is my first dabble into video pron was buying a VHS tape thinking — as I was living alone — it might be fun. In fact it turned out not to be. It was a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of some German ‘action’ filmed from the screen of another TV set and thus was so grainy and gloomy it was impossible to tell what was going on and as my German is limited most of the dialogue, when required by the actors, was unclear to me. I am sure the participants had fun and maybe some of the pre-multi-copied watchers enjoyed what they saw and were able to say “wunderbar!” That wasn’t me though.Anyway, that’s how we learn. I dumped the pretty useless tape and have never felt inclined to buy another. I suppose the lesson is that the pron industry made one sale but having duly failed to provide the goods they lost a potential repeat customer. A bit like politics is today, perhaps…

        Seems like your only goal was to get the word porn and conservative in the same title. The analysis loony. Reminds me of the time, while arguing with a a pro ERA lady (alifetme ago) who in the heat of the moment equated stay at home moms to prostitutes since both put out to get taken care of. Yeah at some level of intellectual abstraction, maybe so. But highly inappropriate. People might look like ants when looking down from the Empire State Building, that does not mean they are.

        “S.E Cupp has a six figure salary despite the fact you can count one hand the number of people who pay any attention to her. That’s because billions flow into the TV chat shows via government regulation.”Huh?  What does this mean — “billions flow into the TV chat shows via government regulation?”  That sounds insightful but seems to mean nonsense (what regulation are you referring to, what evidence do you have to back that fanciful claim up, etc.)  If no one watched S.E. Cupp (and by the way, anyone who supports so-called “gay marriage” is about as ‘conservative’ as Donald Trump — i.e. not very much at all) then I’m sure at some point CNN would pull the plug.  TV relies on advertisers and if they can’t get eyeballs, they close-up shop.

            All over America, governments have granted cable monopolies. They could have required a la carte pricing, but they don’t. The result is Fox, for example, peaks at about 2 million viewers, but 150 million cable hones pay a buck a month to Fox via their cable bill.The same is true of CNN and MSNBC.Cable fees make up the lion’s share of revenues for these channels. Example. ESPN, the most popular channel by far, gets close to 90% of its gross revenue from cable fees. Rating have zero impact on these fees. Therefore, ratings fall in importance, which is why they have gone full on SJW.
