        Maybe Rand Paul will ‚Äútake one for the team‚Äù, while Cruz and Walker are able to step over the broken bodies to victory.  At some point, the efficacy of this little media game will play itself out, but someone needs to do the dirty work.  Personally, I believe the tag team approach is probably best, but someone will probably fold on the GOP side.  They always have, on all things, in the recent past.

        It‚Äôs interesting how many women journalists we have, that do not seem to know how to do the job. Reporters are, in fact, supposed to ask questions, not read a list of bullet points from the DNC. Reporters are also supposed to verify their sources and make sure that all elements of a story are true.Increasingly, these women are making the case that women can‚Äôt cut it in the profession. Would Edward R Murrow have been hurt by Rand‚Äôs remarks? Mike Wallace? If women can‚Äôt take a little criticism, then maybe they really do belong back in the kitchen üôÇ

        Paul has made some mistakes, but the mistakes occur when he concedes narrative territory to the opposition, like taking selfies with Al Sharpton, or fitting Guatemalans with contact lenses.  When he attacks their premises, their hypocrisy, and their editorializing, he is spot on.Paul just forced Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the head of the DNC, to go on record supporting late-term abortion, a stance considerably to the Left of mainstream opinion.  He‚Äôs made the #RiotgrrrlsParty look like fools for now claiming that women in the arena suffer from the vapors when a male candidate gets testy with them.  Now someone can legitimately ask Hillary ‚ÄúIf Savannah Guthrie, a former trial lawyer, is likely to faint during a heated interview because she‚Äôs a woman, how will you deal with Bashir Assad?‚ÄùPerhaps Paul will ask that question himself during a debate.  He‚Äôs been one of the few candidates, or potential candidates, to attack Cankles at every opportunity.  I‚Äôve watched him rip hapless liberal bureaucrats in committee hearings with aplomb.  It‚Äôs a joy to watch.Gingrich got traction in the last election by attacking the media.  Of course, at the end of the day he‚Äôs Newt Gingrich, and he flamed out.  But that approach works.  The only people that get upset when someone attacks the media are other people in the media.  Paul‚Äôs numbers are going through the roof.  When matched against Hillary he‚Äôs the top guy right now.  The establishment Right and Left both hate Paul, so he‚Äôs facing some heavy head winds, and he won‚Äôt catch a break, but he‚Äôs the best thing in the race right now, if only because he is a loose cannon, and offers, even if you don‚Äôt agree with it, an actual alternative.

        I‚Äôm not a fan, but I think he can learn how to finesse these things. He‚Äôs motivated to push back. Now he needs some polish on how to do it correctly.

        No, he doesn‚Äôt deserve a second look. You either bend over and assume the position or put them on their heels and keep them there, like Cruz. ‚ÄúNews‚Äùpeople are even more defective characters than actors. If you treat them as equals, you will be.

        The propagandists at CNN, MSNBC, Al Jeezera, CBS, NBC, etc.,  for the democratic party, these water boys and girls for the democratic party, these useful idiots for the democratic party, these willing enablers of the democrats, these ‚Äújournalists‚Äù that would have been right at home working for Der Sturmer under Geobbels or Pravda or Izvestia under Stalin, do not like to be taken off their soap boxes when they are putting on one of their show trials for the benefit of their Fuhrer, Obama or Hillary or any other democrat.Rand Paul will probably garner more support for challenging these left wing propagandist idiots .

            If Paul keeps poking these people in the eye, he could very well end up winning the nomination. My sense is there is a deep well of resentment amongst GOP voters over the toadying by the GOP.
