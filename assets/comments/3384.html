        “In a statement, the Transgender Rights Project of Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD) noted that it had joined the legal battle on Kosilek’s behalf.”
I seriously doubt that they actually care about Kosilek; it’s just a chance to remove one more penis from the world. 🙂

        Oh no, that’s not Arabic, and she’d be very upset to think that people think it is!  That’s her own form of dating her posts, in defiance of the new-form “CE” or “Common Era” people are using now.  It goes back to this post, from the summer of 2013:http://www.barnhardt.biz/2013/06/06/starting-thursday-off-right-and-notation-change/
It’s Latin, and stands forAnnoReparataeSalutisHumanae
“In The Year Of The Reparation Of Human Salvation”
She says it’s older than “AD”, and uses it now on all her dates.  (She’s very serious about how corrupt the modern era is.)

            I did not know that. I went looking for a source, but nothing jumps out to me and I’m not that interested. It’s a mouthful so I’ll stick with Era Vulgaris.

        I’m unfamiliar with Ann Barnhardt. I looked at her blog and I keep seeing what I suspect is an acronym before dates. I tried to look up “ARSH” but nothing makes sense. In Arabic, it means authority or high place, but I don’t think that’s the meaning here.
Regardless, it is good to see mokita getting picked up elsewhere.

        Off-topic, but Ann Barnhardt just used the word “mokita”:http://www.barnhardt.biz/2014/12/17/yet-another-toldya-commodities-giant-ceases-all-gold-trading/

        I know, I’m old and can’t possibly understand “sexual binary” dis-function.  A man wants to be a woman so society should pay for it?  I want to be a king, I know I was born to be a king but I am stuck in a peasant’s body.  I need society to make me a king.

            The real madness, it seems, is that the courts take seriously these claims. The convict has nothing but time. He’s in jail with nothing better to do. He fills that time filing complaints. I don’t blame the cons for finding ways to be a nuisance. The courts should know better and cut this off, so to speak, before it ever gets to this point.

        One presumes that this inmate’s suicide attempts were not succesful.
So be it. If he/she wants to end it all then that is their choice.
If however the attempts were a so-called “cry for help” then it leaves me cold. As someone once said: “I only acknowledge cries for help when they actually use the word ‘help.&#x27;”

        News flash. After 25 years in stir the prisoner wants to be a bitch for real.I’d think the taxpayer might be happy to make him a eunuch, but that’s all he gets.
