        Twitter and Facebook help me publicize my program – I can tweet pix of students with their robots, or kids in class building stuff (I teach a STEM program), or just let the masses know how the robotics team is doing.  But for personal stuff?  No way.  What a colossal waste of time and energy.

        I have two sons playing college lax for two different teams. While many games are streamed, not all are, or as sometimes happens I can’t be in front of the computer for both games. Usually a parent tweets the game, which is useful to me. As for the political and cultural crap- bah!

        Twitter presents a riddle.  They limit your characters per tweet, yet the stupid content of what people throw up there approaches a positive asymptote.  Shouldn’t these people get the Fail Whale for division by zero?

        Thanks Z. You’ve confirmed my inclination never to go near Twitter without my having to get down in that particular gutter to confirm it myself.

        Former child prodigy and current power bottom Ronan Farrow, sadly no longer the son of Frank Sinatra, is the Hive-acknowledged Lord of the Twitter-verse.  When Rosemary’s Baby first surfaced as the heir to Edward R. Murrow and a future Presidential candidate, we were subject to endless stories about his Twitter genius, that he had mastered the form the way Basho had mastered haiku.  Entire websites were devoted to collecting Farrows gnomic utterances, with their compressed wisdom, their pithy wit, and their jeweled language.Of course, upon closer inspection, Farrow’s aphorisms turned out to be less like La Rochefoucauld’s acid and incisive maxims and more like 140-character versions of a John Stewart routine: cheap, obvious, pseudo-intellection mugging serving as a form of Pavlovian signaling to the salivating mutts of the Millennial Generation.True to form, Mia’s pampered anti-Christ was tweeting away on Easter.  Stuff like “Probably my favorite part of the Old Testament is the giant egg laying rabbit”, and “It was the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD that settled church doctrine on Jesus’s divinity, the Easter calendar, and hiding Cadbury Creme Eggs.”Not exactly Nietzsche, but then Farrow was educated at Bard College, where issuing a grade can get a professor’s tenure revoked.  Predictably, every tweet is followed by a chorus of yelps from the lab hounds, howling in unison, LOLLLLLLLLLLL!It’s Nietzsche alright, or rather Nietzsche’s last men, whose ultimate dominion he so presciently predicted two centuries prior.

        Twitter should be witty in the true spirit of ‘brevity is wit.’ Often it isn’t twitty at all. I agree there is the occasional gem among the dross but you have to read a lot to find them.On the other hand Twitter can be a useful guide to what people are thinking even if a lot of people don’t have coherent thoughts. Certainly the ordinary people are not as fooled by socialist rhetoric as the elite might like to think, and there is a lot of realism about the climate-change scam.For a time though I did follow some leftoids  on twitter to see what they were thinking. True, not much of a surprise that they weren’t thinking much at all but their level of idiocy and supine acceptance of being led by the nose did amaze even me.  In this respect Twitter has its place because as it only takes a moment to rattle out some red-stained froth, you can see what the freedom-haters really think.

            before Twitter and Facebook, I remarked to a friend that 95% of cellphone traffic was between low-IQ nitwits. The very small fraction of people who needed mobile phone service we subsidized by the tens of millions who had no need for it. Tye trade-off was having to listen to these idiots talk to one another in public. Every once in a while, one would run over someone or walk in front of a bus.I’m not see any trade-off on Twitter. At least with FB, grannies can get to see pics of their grandkids without having to spend time with the daughter in-law or son-in-law. Twitter just looks like a room full of lunatics bellowing at one another.

                “…..95% of cellphone traffic was between low-IQ nitwits……..”  Yeah, I noticed that 10 years ago myself.“Wassup?”“Yo, wassup?”———-It’s either that, or, the usual conversation overheard at the grocery store:  “Does Bobby like the Count Chocula with the blueberry crumblies, or Captain Crunch with the strawberry crunchies?”  How was grocery shopping ever conducted before cellular phones?(Whoops…how stupid of me.  There are no “Bobby’s” here in the heart of Orange County anymore.   This is the land of the Conner, the Tanner and the Tyler.Tho funny thing…I can go to Santa Ana, and in any random group of five delinquents strutting the street one will be nicknamed Joker, just like 35 years ago.Time stands still in the barrio.

        Zuckerberger said that Facebook users are “dumbfucks”… There is no need for NSA PRISM, everybody is willing in giving their information.
