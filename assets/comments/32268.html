        Women are both highly neurotic and hard wired to welcome invaders, who after all are the winners, while the home team failed or they wouldn‚Äôt be here‚Ä¶When women were given full voting rights in the US (in Britain, only married women 30+ could vote initially) the handwriting was on the wall‚Ä¶Lord Acton was right‚Ä¶they can‚Äôt be allowed to decide anything that matters‚Ä¶.The screaming can commence now!

                Only Anglo-Germanic landowning married men can vote.
How many of the country‚Äôs problems are directly downstream from deciding that mixed race peoples like Italians, Jews, and Poles were ‚Äúwhite enough‚Äù to influence the political process of the country?
The concept of whiteness has been nothing but an unmitigated disaster for Euro-descended Americans, consistently leading to more and more dilution of our blood and culture. 20 years from now the same people who thought Kagans and Kozlowskis were white enough will be telling us that mestizos are white enough.

                    Yes.
Surely asemiticidea of whiteness, rather than the historical concept upon which the founders relied, derived directly from biology, would serve us better.

                    Fascinatingly, Italy and Poland runcirclesaround the US in terms of a monolithic culture that still respects Christianity and the old traditions and ways. I have seen this first hand with my own eyes, so please, do go on with your hot takes‚Ä¶Doubly fascinatingly, you cleverly insert the most destructive parasitic tribe in history neatly between these two European cultures.Keeping the franchise to ‚ÄúAnglo adjacent‚Äù is what largely got us here I hate to tell you. New England Anglos were (and are) all too willing to work with your tribal chameleons to undermine our nation.Nothing like a little ‚ÄúDivide and Conquer‚Äù amongst the already massive minority that are Europeans from a global point of view, right Rabbi? (We are less than 10% of the population of the world despite what the far left race hustlers would like you to believe)

                        Sub‚Äôs thinking is exactly the reasoning given by our minority grifters as why ‚Äúwhite‚Äù race should not be capitalized while ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHispanic‚Äù, should be.  Hell, we even do this here in the group from time to time.
AP, your response is the correct one.

                I read your reply quickly the first time but then I slowed myself down and got it. My initial reading was only white lawn-mowing men should be allowed to vote. The more I think about it though, my reading should be the right one. If you‚Äôre so lazy that you hire mowing done, then you probably don‚Äôt have the proper outlook on life to make right decisions when you vote. And your kids and wife count as you for voting purposes. Sweating and frugality are pretty good indicators of voter qualification.

            As a married women I agree. Who was it exactly who agreed to woman‚Äôs suffrage? Hmm‚Ä¶The collapse of civilization is because of the disinterest by the men and the vain hope that the women will fill in the void. Women always had enough to do before we became ‚Äúequals‚Äù or whatever.Complaining that women can‚Äôt make public decisions is itself a symptom of the problem. Of course we can‚Äôt. Now what?I see a lot of normal men who benefit from women in decision making/money making positions while they pursue dream careers/buy toys/etc. If a man is willing to go do a boring job to support a family while doing boring civic things, amen. If a man is whining about how women can‚Äôt make decisions while they go do the stuff they wanted for funsies, then it‚Äôs time to look in the mirror.

            Since corporations and banks own most of America, my modification has always been that men can only vote if they pay more in taxes than they receive in direct pay or benefits.  No government employee or contractor should be allowed to vote, nor should anyone on the dole.
and as long as we‚Äôre in fantasy land, any company bigger than a predefined % of GDP should be immediately broken up and sold.  Apple, Google, Amazon, Blackrock, Boeing, etc.

                Love your second paragraph. Many of AINO‚Äôs corporations are richer and more powerful than a sizeable minority of countries. That‚Äôs too great a concentration of money and power, and we can see the damage these corporations do.

            Too right, 3g.This odd statement of only holding our politicos to account is thrown around plenty. The statement always seems to be one of those ones that goes quite far, but then at the precipice withdraws itself: ‚Äúsee, we don‚Äôt hate all these non-white aliens!‚Äù.My personal view is that they simply are not compatible with our (former) countries ways. And this is, as Z notes, down to skin colour ‚Äì pure and simple. When they look into the history texts of our (former) nations, they see no connection because, hey, it‚Äôs a bunch of whites!In my own experience, the ingratitude of non-whites plus their brutality and outright hatred of my own country has made me reason that even if they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù, they don‚Äôt belong. And if they mess things up, I don‚Äôt want them here.Basically, if a low IQ savage smashes up my front lawn and tries to bust into my house and hurt me and mine, I don‚Äôt give a hare‚Äôs hind leg if he ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù his actions. The action counts.

Preach it, sister.  The ugliness of it all is something I hate too.  I hate the ugly art, the ugly cars, the ugly buildings, the people made ugly being covered in tattoos and piercings. I hate the ugly clothes.  It is so pervasive one has to believe it is done deliberately.

            Even among those who still claim to patriotic, I wonder how they really feel about a photo that accompanied the post Z Man cited.  When patriotic whites see this, I wonder if they feel an aching sadness for the past or a deep anxiety about the future.

The photo supports my suspicions that my country has been intentionally stolen by those who hate traditional whites.

                    Part of it is the want to win at all costs, too. Did they want to field a Canadian team, or did they want the bestest team ever? That gets you black athletes in most sports.

                                    ?? Soccer as game is almost random. Sports with honest skills and solid rules involve reasonably predictable outcomes. Soccer has exactly zero of those, unless it‚Äôs a teenage boys soccer team against a pro women‚Äôs team.Yippee, a random team kicked the behind of some random team. Whatever. Wake me up when it involves an actual test of skills.

                            I‚Äôm surprised at the negative votes at my comment. It does speak to the level of love of sportsball. We do have integration because coaches/owners/fans want to win, more than they care about having a national/regional team.Africans sprint/run better than Europeans. We know that because we measure it. Soccer is sprinting after a ball in a very simple game that lacks advanced strategy. It‚Äôs an African game in that sense, so why worry about it? ‚ÄúFootball‚Äù is the international sport because it‚Äôs dead stupid and anyone can pick up the rules.If you want a naturally white game it will need to be baseball. It‚Äôs mostly white still in places that are heavily black. And of course in American football, the quarterbacks are almost all white.

        Rikki Schlott has spent the past six months writing articles about how colleges need to crack the skulls of people protesting Israeli genocide, and how Jews on Ivy League campuses are the real victims. If she is patriotic about any country, it‚Äôs not the USA. In fact, you can go back to her archives in the NY Post and see just what a mess the conservative ideology is, and why it is going nowhere and will go nowhere.

How about it, Z? Are you making enough money to outfit an army of disgruntled dissidents and patriots with arms and ammunition? Certainly your jewish cohort, Cornelius Rye ‚Äì has access to better pricing with the military industrial complex?

                        Are speaking of Palestinians? I agree that immigration has long been out of control. Nevertheless, doesn‚Äôt it seem strange that our overlords, that one and a half percent you speak of, would think it‚Äôs a good idea to import even larger numbers of people who have no love lost for the folk of the other religion just across the border? If our elite are really that stupid, I say let‚Äôs import the lot of ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù and perhaps they‚Äôll have the balls to do what needs to be done, to rid us of a very large number of turbulent priests, as it were.

            They pulled the wool over our eyes. It was just a scam to get us to support warmongering on Israel‚Äôs behalf and tax breaks for (((billionaires))) so they could Hoover up all of this nation‚Äôs wealth. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm wondering if green energy might not be a bad thing. If we lessen our reliance on oil, maybe we can wash our hands of that place and give it back to the Europeans.

                Oil dependency is not really the problem.  We can get plenty of it here if needed.  The problem is we relied on oil control ‚Äì i.e., the petrodollar ‚Äì to prop up our fake currency. That appears to be coming to an end.  Interesting times ahead.

        30 years of cultural programming about how it was really blacks, women, feather Indians and exotic immigrants who bled for and built America instead of white dudes has really taken it‚Äôs toll on ‚Äúpatriotism.‚ÄùExample: Roughly 800 black US military servicemen were KIA in WWII. About 400,000 total servicemen died.You can‚Äôt have a WWII movie or documentary without prominently featuring the black experience. Usually the theme is how awful the racism was. (Uh, maybe ‚Äúthe death‚Äù was much worse?)The silver lining is no one, black/white/woman/man is interested in dying for their country anymore. Patriotism is for nationalism which is easily manipulated by the state to engage in mass slaughter.Welcome to the global economic zone. The purpose of America is to make money. That‚Äôs pretty much it. Maybe it was always thus.

            I see George Monbiot in The Guardian arguing for ‚Äúrearmament.‚Äù It is to laugh. The women and the muds don‚Äôt want to fight for a country they‚Äôve been taught is built on white supremacy. The men don‚Äôt want to fight for a country that has marginalized them. The country itself has deindustrialized. And Monbiot, in typical shitlib fashion, thinks whoever is in charge can just snap their fingers and make ‚Äúrearmament‚Äù happen.

                Jeffrey Zoar: ‚ÄòI see George Monbiot in The Guardian arguing for ‚Äúrearmament.‚Äù‚Äò
But re-arm with WHAT precisely?
Apparently so-called ‚Äúmoderin‚Äù navies don‚Äôt even have the sophistication necessary for stopping a Drone-Dinghy-Thingamabob filled with dynamite:https://www.businessinsider.com/sea-drones-change-naval-warfare-give-smaller-navies-edge-expert-2024-7

The weapons are becoming more deadly even faster than [almost] anyone can build the weapons.
There are Meta-Darwinistic phenomena at work here which could have horrifying consequences in the not-too-distant future.
A) Start with Classical Warships.
B) Then Gen-1 Drone Dinghies sink all Classical Warships.
C) Then Gen-2 DroneDinghiessink allGen-1Drone Dinghies.
D) Then Gen-3 DroneDinghiessink all  Gen-2Drone Dinghies, etc etc etc‚Ä¶
And there will be a similar technology race, beneath the surface of the water, where Gen-1 Drone Submarines take out all Classical Submarines; then in the air, withGen-1Drone Missiles taking out all classical Aircraft, and on the ground, with Gen-1 Drone Tanks taking out all Classical Tanks, followed by all of the above being recycled &amp; repeated through Gen-2 &amp; Gen-3 &amp; Gen-4, etc etc etc‚Ä¶
Where the hell does it end, short of everyone being dead?
This is some seriously Meta-Darwinian sh!znat we‚Äôre talking here.
Seriously Meta-Darwinian.

        It is tempting to hate the barbarians flooding into the country, but the fault lies with the rich people who run the country.
Well, yes. Of course it is the fault of those in power and those who are evil.
But I can‚Äôt stand most of the barbarians, either. Can we simply just detest both? Makes no difference to me whether the barbarians ‚Äúknow what they‚Äôre doing or not‚Äù ‚Äì they destroy all the same.

        The Fourth is the closest thing we have to a holiday for whites.
Here in western NY the holiday is celebrated on the Finger Lakes with ‚Äúrings of fire.‚Äù Everyone lights red flares at 10 pm, outlining the entire waterfront for miles with a red nimbus, accompanied (of course) by fireworks both public and private. Colossal amounts of beer are consumed, hundreds of cattle are slaughtered, butchered, and (yes) grilled. Flags fly from houses, docks, and boats. If not American flags, then Trump 2024 flags.
The Diversity? Yeah, not so much. All this in a ‚Äúdeep blue‚Äù state.

                Additionally, it‚Äôs more of a centrist and rightist thing, too. In that connexion it‚Äôs interesting to note that even after the transition of America to Leftist AINO, Leftists are still far less patriotic than everybody else. Their hatred of country is so deeply ingrained that they can‚Äôt abandon it even after they‚Äôve gained absolute control and become the establishment.

        Patriotism ‚Äì what a joke.  My former country hates me so I now hate it back.  I would much rather wipe my behind with the flag now than proudly display it.  The country that flag represented is long gone never to return.  All that remains is rubble filled with low IQ savages imported from foreign lands.  There is nothing in existence that has the capacity to measure my hatred for these brown hoards and their masters.  No pain or suffering they could endure would be too much for me to feel any compassion or sympathy for them.

        I had to read it for myself, but the complete lack of recognition of self-taught hate is astonishingPerhaps an odd metaphor, but I had the unfortunate chance to see the new ‚ÄúLittle Mermaid‚Äù cartoon by Disney this week‚Ä¶and it is a shining example; it was never about being equal or having ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù ‚Äì it was about having the whip hand‚Ä¶.and using it good and hard.

That ‚ÄòJersey Wop‚Äô (Vinny the Vette driver) stereotype has done more to poison the well of this ancient culture than probably anything in recent memory.Utter embarrassment. The vast majority speak not a single word of their madrelingua excepting a few curse words and some Americano bastardized Neopolitan slang they learned from watching the Sopranos too much.These are the people who brought us the Roman Empire, Latin, Christianity, etc. reduced to a caricature of a fat hairy guinea eating ‚Äúgabbagool‚Äù(pro-tip: no Italian knows this word)telling us how much he knows about the ‚ÄúOld Country (read: nothing)

                Vacation &gt; kid &gt; cartoons on the tv = seeing the show.i made a point to ask my daughter where were the white people and remind her that The Little Mermaid was white.She mistakenly pointed to the Hispanic character and I corrected her.The funniest thing was that Ursula was now a sassy Queen called ‚ÄúTauntie‚Äù (sp?)They have the reigns and it‚Äôs not a single white character allowed vs ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù.Vengeance rather than equality,I make sure, when I can, that my girl notices.

                    Avoiding the worst of the woke in movies isn‚Äôt nearly as demanding on parents as homeschooling‚Äîand it‚Äôs a lot cheaper. All the great animated features from the Disney Renaissance of the 90s are available in HD quality via torrenting, as are their earlier classics. Get a free torrent client and do a bit of searching for magnets online. For the paranoid, a no-log VPN for a couple of dollars a month will throw off the MPA. Homemade popcorn costs a fraction of what they charge for it in theaters (it‚Äôs how they make their profits).

            This is a point that is too often misunderstood. It‚Äôs not about equality or equity at all, and probably never has been. That is merely palliative rhetoric intended to keep whites listless and docile as they are dispossessed and marginalized. The true objective is the subjugation of whites and transferrence of all power to the Coalition of Freaks.

                One silver lining in the black pill: That coalition of the fringes (‚Äúfreaks‚Äù is quite apt, too) has a critical design flaw: it‚Äôs inherently unstable. Of course factionalism can be a problem in any group movement, or even a family. But the Democrats, a reasonable shorthand for the Deep State in this example, has taken the hare brained idea of being the champion of the marginalized to extremes. Now, this works to an extent, especially when the Other can be identified as Whitey, conservative values, whatever. And of course, Whites suffer. That‚Äôs inevitable, probably. What also seems inevitable is that the coalition is very volatile, and highly failure prone. An excellent example of this is the cognitive dissonance that we‚Äôve seen in the past year of pro-Palestinian university protestors vs, the traditional Jew-Worshipping cohort. It‚Äôs hard to square those two.

        I hiked a busy Laurel Falls trail in Great Smoky Mountains National Park this morning. All I wanted was a nice hike through the forest with my family. I expected crowds, but that‚Äôs okay. What I did not expect was to reach the top where the falls are and see two south Asian fags standing up on the waterfall preening and posing for photos for 20 minutes. People just wanted to snap a few picks of the scenery and head back down. Instead, they stayed up there taking showers under the falls, one of them only half dressed.There were south Asians all around, none of them saying anything. The white people looked pissed, but nobody said anything. So I started yelling at them to get down. It took all of my restraint not to yell ‚ÄúGet off the waterfall you fags. Stop acting like douchebags and let other people enjoy the view.‚Äù They pretended not to hear me yelling, but I could tell I was getting to them and the male douchebag got uncomfortable and escorted his male b***h down.I was proud of my wife for getting in the face of the south Asian girl who was taking the pictures. I wish I‚Äôd thought of that quicker.Patriotism? For this? F@@k those people. I kept hoping they‚Äôd slip on the slick rock and fall to their deaths.A confrontation is coming.  These people are flooding our country and contributing nothing while earning our contempt.

            ‚ÄúAsian fags standing up on the waterfall preening and posing for photos for 20 minutes.‚ÄùThis is the mixture of cultures.  As I‚Äôve been told, Asians, especially Chinese, travel as tourists to ‚Äútake pictures‚Äù, not really enjoy/appreciate the natural attraction.  They then bring these pictures back home to show off to their friends and neighbors. It‚Äôs more of a status thing for them, than for tourists from the West.My experience was similar.  Wife and I spent a night in a motel where Chinese tourist bus stopped for the night.  The ‚Äúfree‚Äù breakfast was mobbed by the Chinese, and of course completely wiped out by this avarice hoard who wiped out the free buffet by taking *everything* they could carry.  That there was a line behind them meant nothing.  If you were first, screw the people behind you.

                It is fascinating to observe the cultural differences between Chinese &amp; Japanese given their close proximity. Japanese would not be caughtdeaddoing that kind of stuff.
Chinese, at 1 billion people, really are like a swarm of locusts. Pajeets are right there with them and with similar awful behaviors more reminiscent of insects than humans. Anyone that simply keeps breeding prolifically into the billions when you are dirt azz poor you pretty much are telegraphing to humans that you are more insect than homo-sapien, IMHO.

                    Yes, but I wonder if it is a population density phenomenon.  Japan is quite small for its current population.  China has as much area as the USA.  We‚Äôd need to run the numbers and do a bit of math.  I won‚Äôt.  Lots of conflation in the comparisons, but the observable fact remains.Heck, there was even a booklet published by the Chinese authorities for their people traveling overseas, the Nuevo Rich, on how to behave in Western countries and not embarrass the nation.  For example, they had to explain that it was not appropriate to take a piss behind the bushes when visiting Western tourist attractions.And yes, I saw the booklet‚Ä¶

            It‚Äôs not even that they should contribute. They aren‚Äôt us, and that‚Äôs enough.I think that‚Äôs the message of Othello. I wonder if Shakespeare predicted this crass meritocratic age. Othello contributed to Venice with his skill as a soldier, perhaps even leader. But he was ultimately targeted because he didn‚Äôt belong there, ordering real Venicians about, despite the senates love for him.
then he seduces one of their own, a Venician woman. And that was enough for the gods to send the great destroyer after everyone involved

        Even if I despise our rulers, July 4 will always have a special place in my heart. There are few holidays in any nation that is as unapologetically jingoistic and in your face as today. You have loud fireworks, aggressive colors, and grilling massive slabs of meat, all to commemorate a group of men who essentially signed their death sentence to become a new elite.
America f*ck yeah.

                ‚ÄúThe Founding Fathers were a combination of extremely intelligent, moral and very courageous men‚Ä¶‚ÄùAnd what conditions surrounded and imbued such men with these time honored virtues?  White heritage (intelligence), belief in God and training in His Word (morality), and hardship to be overcome through hard work and effort (courage)!Unfortunately, all of these conditions are now in dwindling supply in this nation, hence Z-man‚Äôs astute observation on 21st century American patriotism and why we can *never* simply return to the past.  But we can, we must, use these virtues to guide us into the future‚Äîor of what use will such a future be even if achieved?We must aspire to these virtues now as our Founding Fathers once did in the past.   The goal for us must be from this day forward to seek to reestablish *new* conditions as will create such virtues in the people.That is my Independence Day hope and prayer for us all‚Ä¶

                        3g4me. The Founding Fathers were of course human and therefore subject to human foibles as we all are. A few were even downright bastards in our 21st century understanding. We all ‚Äúfall short‚Äùas taught in the Bible.Here is where I disagree with you:We as a race *need* our hero‚Äôs. If we are required to elevate somewhat failed men, then so be it. The ‚Äúother side‚Äù makes their ‚Äúhero‚Äôs‚Äù out of whole cloth.Joseph Campbell in his book, ‚ÄúThe Power Of Myth‚Äù considers such founding myths as valid‚Äîeven if exaggerated or basically untrue‚Äîbecause he considers such to represent what a society ‚Äúaspires‚Äù to. A statement of their goals if you will.No one believes the tale (myth) of George Washington as a boy cutting down the cherry tree. Yet it was told to me in Catholic parochial school as encouragement to be truthful. A part of their moral development teaching to young Catholics. Yet a lie in itself.So it is when I speak glowingly of, and in defense of, our Founders‚Äîand hell I‚Äôm not even of English heritage and a first generation immigrant myself to this country. Yet these men inspire me and in such make me an American and a direct (spiritual) descendent of these men.If the above were not true, can you explain why the Leftists are so hell bent to discredit and remove the Founders from public prominence? They realize the importance of such history to White racial solidarity. I will not let them have that victory.

                        Absolutely, but I was playing off of the direct quote of Pyrrhus so did not include all of the desired and necessary virtues.
As to self sacrifice, one need only look up what the Founders lost in their support for the Revolution.  Unlike our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù today, none went into the conflict poor and came out of the conflict a wealthy man, and some lost all.

                I predict that within the next‚Ä¶. 20 years or so, that fake holiday they invented after the floyd riots will supplant today.

                        Would you be surprised if it played out exactly like that? I see memes being passed around social media mocking the Founding Fathers and July 4th. It‚Äôs already in motion. The spiteful mutants hate them and the country they founded. They want to define this country differently, built on the Emma Lazarus poem they defaced the Statue of Liberty with, and the Israel Zangwill play.

                Yes, when I was a kid I used to live in a small, all white town.  Went to the parade every year with vintage fire trucks rolling down the street, the local school sport teams would March even though school was out for the summer.  There would be clean food trucks selling good food, not Mexican roach coaches.
The town had a fireworks display usually the weekend after because it cost too much to hire pyrotechnic teams to work on the 4th.

        Slowly, ever so slowly I see good men around me coming to this conclusion about our current state of affairs. The wildcard is Trump, those same men look to Trump for a life raft to not swim away from the sinking ship of liberal democracy. This process is going to have to play out further yet before the final realization of failure hits them.I genuinely hope Trump can reform something in the Leviathan but I already realize that reform of the current system has about a 95% chance of failure assuming Trump can even run the gauntlet.It‚Äôs going to take more time for normal Americans to come down this path as far.as some of us have traveled but many have at least observed that.the current path they.are travelling is leading them into ever more hostile territory.

                    ‚ÄúI wonder if our salvation might not lie with the lefties, to some extent?‚ÄùI have thought this for a long time, not necessarily the current left, but rather the pychological wiring that leads someone to become a lefty in the current environment.  So a future generation of the ‚Äúlefty‚Äù probably.Here is the hard truth.  Conservatives are wired to be risk adverse and adhere to tradition.  The current conservatives, had they been born in the 1700s would have been loyalists to the crown and kicked out of America into Canada after they lost the revolution.Most Republicans only revere the founding fathers because they inherited that tradition.Conservatives are both incapable of creating a country like we had, or capable of maintaining it.After all, they just want to be left alone.  They are not men of action, they look after their narrow domestic interests.  While conservatives are capable of building small businesses, communities, and families, they don‚Äôt build large organizations or make revolutionary changes.  They are mostly bystanders to history, who grumble when things change, but ultimately find a way to adapt to their circumstances.Our civilization is dying not because the ‚Äúlefty‚Äù mental phenotype exists, but rather because it has been corrupted.  What could the world look like if the mental programing of the anitifa rioters had been virtous?  I don‚Äôt think those people would ever be ‚Äúconservative‚Äù, but those type of people are actually needed in a purer form to build what we had.

                        I think there are signs the Power Structure is shifting toward containment rather than destruction of Trump. They seem to have concluded that the latter is almost impossible without full support from SCOAINO, and that it will be easier to cut deals with Trump and box him in so that he can do very little actual damage to the BFE while in office. And I suspect Trump is amenable.

Does kicking a hornets nest work out well if you just stand there like an idiot afterwards?
You either kill them or leave them alone.  Making things you hate angry often backfires.
Since Trump is incompetent, he will serve to activate the left and cause us more problems.
You just want to take another lazy shot at the King and you don‚Äôt care if you miss and the King turns around and murders your whole family.

                                I replied, but it never got past the scambot.It‚Äôs a simple act with basically zero cost.I totally reject the framing of taking a shot at the king.  I‚Äôm one guy in a city of 1.5 million or one guy in a country of 300 million plus.It does sometimes have a posittive effect, like not getting approval for the latest money wasting scheme.  It didn‚Äôt stop Krasner or the bag ban (it‚Äôs infuriating), but it didn‚Äôt cost me anything. It took only a few minutes to cast my vote as I live fairly close to the polling location.I will never take the left‚Äôs reaction to what I might do into account or change my behavior in anticipation that they will be angered.  They‚Äôre lunatics. They are going to do what they do no matter what.What you are saying is ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt vote trump because it will anger the left and make them dial up all the things they are already doing‚Äù  I have no respect for this position.

            Here‚Äôs an argument for independence, not at the national, but of the self.Political action has its place, but it only works well in a well-functioning civil society. We still have that, to some degree, but its shelf life is very uncertain. Even in the best of times, conventional political action (by Joe Citizen, I don‚Äôt mean the elite) is at best a dilution of effort. The defeatist will say ‚Äúyour vote is irrelevant.‚Äù Even if it has some value, it‚Äôs a tiny influence on the overall outcome. A similar case exists if you volunteer in a campaign: Your effort is, at best, a tiny part of a mass movement.Another disconcerting observation is that as our society becomes less civil, your political activity usually identifies you by varying degrees as ally or enemy of the existing power elite. If you worked for the losing side, this fact may be noted by the winners.Now let‚Äôs pretend we‚Äôve taken the oppose extreme: that of withdrawing from the political drama. Perhaps you no longer display signs in your yard or bumper stickers on your car. You may or may not still vote, depending upon what value you place on your vote actually influencing an outcome.¬†If you‚Äôre especially cynical you may believe that the candidates are basically the same, they are controlled by special interest, so why bother?Well, whatcanyou do? A lot, it turns out, at the individual level. You can educate yourself about relevant topics. You can learn skills that may be helpful in your present life, and perhaps in a more troubled future where certain skills might be highly valuable, even life saving. You can lay up supplies to insulate yourself from being highly dependent upon an unreliable outside world. This could be anything from some gold and silver coins, firearms and ammo, non-perishable food, etc. Or being less ‚Äúprepper,‚Äù you perhaps operate a business that requires an inventory. Perhaps it‚Äôs in your power to lay in supplies of essential materials beyond what you‚Äôd normally do, against the chance of future price hikes or supply disruptions. The more adventurous might consider the TomA antibody option. The specifics of that are a bit spicy to discuss in print, normally. In any event, those are probably the best example of what the interested individual research and practice on his own. The rational man does not normally wish his house to catch fire. But he might keep a fire extinguisher on hand against the eventuality.A major point I‚Äôm trying to make: You have far more power at the individual level, to act upon your own initiative. Now it‚Äôs true that some enterprises require a group, whether of two or a thousand. But there‚Äôs always a cost in even locating potential allies. There‚Äôs an even greater cost, and much lower chance of success, if you feel a need to convert others to your cause. Instead of pining for some savior on a white horse to solve all your problems, why not ponder what you can do of your own initiative to accomplish what‚Äôs important to you?

                People in 1896 needed to be doing these things.  People in 1000AD and 1000BC needed to be doing these things.  They are all good things to do.  I have zero criticism of your list of things.  Personal development and prudence for the future is well advised, in all times and places.  There is no shortage of personal indulgence and giving in to the temptations of clownworld, even on our side.  So this is a short list of excellent advice.But it is also a sign of the accused resigning to his fate and preparing to quietly meet his maker.  We need political change along with the personal development.A big difference between the left and right is the left is willing to pay costs for their beliefs and the right is not.  Granted, we are prudent men looking out for not only our own welfare, but the welfare of those of our families and communities.  The costs weigh far more heavily on us than they do on leftists. Plus, leftists get to make other people pay at least some of the costs, like the people who go out and riot when the dial-a-mob phone rings.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to vote ourselves out of this mess‚Äù is a euphemism and metaphor.  We‚Äôre not going to save our way out of this mess or personally grow and improve out of this mess.  We need bold leaders and a call to action from said bold leaders.  We are absolutely not going to rise to action if the current system fails in some unpredictable way.  People would double down on what they are doing now, which is nothing.  They‚Äôre going to ‚Äòdo nothing‚Äô even more and harder.Today we celebrate the brave men, the very flawed but brave men who signed a piece of paper saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fed up and we‚Äôre not going to take it anymore‚Äù and then acted on that paper they signed.  Something like 1/2 of them paid the ultimate price or died in utter poverty with their families destroyed.  Unless and until we get such a group of high profile wealthy and powerful men, absolutely nothing will change.  Even if the status quo suddenly and spectacularly failed, absolutely nothing would change.  In fact, it is far more likely it gets worse because our enemies already have these bold powerful men willing to act on their side. They act in small ways now, but it would be in big ways amongst the chaos of a system collapse.

                        I last voted in 2016 for Trump.  Before that I skipped 2012, and greatly regret my 2008 vote for McCain (despite my loathing for the black jebus, I should have just sat it out).  When we moved I used a friend‚Äôs business address back in Texas for mail forwarding (and she then sent it on to me privately).  I have donated nothing to anyone politically since 2016.  I am STILL getting crap from the repuke national committee, Mike Johnson, the neocon think tanks, etc.  They are all on my list for lampposts.

All of the embedded images in that article are reason enough. The white erasure is near total. Look at the phsyiognomies of them. I think they photoshopped diverse and marginalized faces on that photo as they all look deformed. Even the Post needs diversity so badly they will do this.
When the entire society is blatantly erasing you from all of its imagery, not enough patriotism is the least of your problems. What I said earlier holds. Wow! Those pictures say it all.

The only patriotism I saw on display were the pakies and chinks flying the maple leaf on their cars and some of the very old boomers that are clued out about what is happening to their country.I might be tempted to fly the Red Ensign (Canada‚Äôs equivalent of America‚Äôs rebel flag) but there are so many crazies around here, it just might invite stuff like vandalism and altercations with crazies and nutters. Compounding my issue with publicly declaring my treason is that my neighbours are vibrant and diverse. For now, they are the kind that are well trained, obedient and well behaved ‚Äì but that is only because our gutted housing market prices real diversity out.You‚Äôre right, Z. There is no fixing this.

        France is a possible counter-point to this. While, yes, you have the invading hordes, France has retained a strong core of patriotism, which you can see in the youth vote.
They have a unique relationship with their revolution in that it was a violent collapse in the old order, but it has also been viciously defended with 19th century nationalism. It‚Äôs like how communism stored Eastern Europe‚Äôs social norms in amber that NATO is now destroying.

            The problem many nations would face, if there was a desire to return to a former state, would be what to do about the aliens (non-European stock.) No country I‚Äôm aware of even has the will to deport, much less halt the entry of, current migrants. Even if this could be accomplished, what is to be done about those who arrived legally? Their children? Their grandchildren? France has been accepting alien cultures the longest, perhaps. There are easily three or more generations of now native born citizens there who, for all practical purposes, will never assimilate into the legacy French culture.It‚Äôs wonderful that the Ottomans were turned back from the gates of Vienna in 1683. Today‚Äôs situation is a bit more problematic: to a large degree, the invaders weren‚Äôt repulsed, indeed the city gates were opened wide, they were welcomed, given homes, food, drink, even wives. Today, Vienna is one-third foreign nationals (I couldn‚Äôt find a racial breakdown, but it‚Äôs probably safe to assume they aren‚Äôt all ethnic Germans.) That, in fact, is a fairly apt generalization of the problem of nearly all ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù nations.Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time (and there have been several distinct ‚Äútimes‚Äù). These poor souls were down on their luck. Many were legitimate refugees, or at least claimed to be. And besides, we needed cheap labor and they were willing to work for below market rates. (Leaving aside the issue of those who were imported against their will.) Whether it was picking crops in America‚Äôs southwest or factory work in Germany, labor shortages were a common cry echoing through our past. Well, a lot of those people stayed, had children, got citizenship. Alas, Juan, Achmed or Mahatma and their progeny, on the whole, haven‚Äôt turned out to be the equal of the founding stock. Alll is not lost: there are some fine ethnic restaurants.

        The Cloud People have perfected the use of modern technology to indoctrinate and maneuver the weak-minded and easily bribed cohort of our society. The ‚ÄúNarrative‚Äù is the archetype of this technique, but the tools are smart phones and internet social media. And make no mistake, it works. See Covid mask madness and mRNA vaccines as an example. But can this mechanism be hijacked? Can the 30+ million imported young male invaders be conditioned to storm the Bastille rather than sow chaos and violence among the Dirt People? It‚Äôs worth a try. Turnabout is fair play if you ask me. Kill two birds with one stone.

                ‚ÄúInjecting‚Äù despair is one of their most effective cyber techniques, as demonstrated in your posting. The idea is to get the opponent to quit before the battle even begins.

        Part of hating the past is hating Americans. Free riding on a civilizations institutions to get credentialed and then become employed in its industries won‚Äôt make patriots. Even without the industry of anti-American hatred purveyed by the American institutions, these people would not be patriotic in any significant number. Patriotism requires shared sacrifice not self indulgence.Of course the GWOT called for the warriors to sacrifice and the reasons given for it were brazenly violated in short order. That destroys patriotism amongst the only people who have feelings that can be stirred to acts of patriotism.It is simple. I hate this country and I hate its institutions all of them. Why? Well, they hate me and they hate me in the worst way one can hate someone. They want me gone. They want me erased and they erase and dispossess me and my kind in effigy in preparation for erasing me in reality. The most healthy instinct and response to that is hatred.They have radicalized countless people ‚Äì a significant number of whom are going to turn out highly competent and who will have significant numbers of highly motivated people to aid their cause.We must continue to celebrate our traditions even as we embark on creating new traditions and new accomplishments that will become the primary markers of our shared cultural heritage. This is important to honor our ancestors and to learn from them. While they destroy the past, they have no future. While we honor it we make fertile the grounds for the future.Today I think of the men wintering at Valley Forge. Times were very difficult and very bleak. They cut off pieces of their shoes and warmed them as food to survive. Many perished from sickness. Yet, they persevered. A collective effort of statesmen, warriors, farmers, dutiful sons and wives saw the pledge of their sacred honor and their lives through to victory.Go bind yourself to the land. You don‚Äôt have to homestead, but own even a modest piece and do some work on it and help your neighbors. Consort with fellow owners and stewards of land. A people bound to the land and to bound to each other through it will hold and defend it. They will be capable of recognizing their true enemies. Normally, war is what creates that bond that forms patriots and strengthens loyalty. It must be a just war and it must be fought for hearth and home.Today, that is not an option. It is not an option to fight for a Regime that hates you and your past and to fight for the stranger‚Äôs home as they invite in more strangers and hand him yours. In its place, we quietly invest even some small amount of work in the land. Do not underestimate the power of that loyalty. It is going to be a long struggle and we need to cultivate the ground in the present. That brings future reward whose promise will not be relinquished without tenacious struggle.I raise a glass to the Winter Soldiers. I salute the grit and mettle of the American Patriot whose tenacity helped realize the promise of Their Cause.Happy Independence Day everyone.

            I love this country for the same reason I loved my parents. They were almost like gods to me as a child. When I became a man I put aside childish things and got to know them as people, and yes, let‚Äôs only say that I discovered that they were not gods, far from perfect, even annoying and ignorant at times, about certain subjects. In spite of all that I went on loving them and my heart broke when they died. They endured hardships in the 30s and 40s and built a life, which included me growing up in a secure home, fed and clothed, free as a bird after school and until 6 pm (sharp ‚Äì dad wanted to eat).This is my homeland. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù took it fair and square  (by historical standards of ‚Äòfair and square‚Äô) meaning we conquered it and drove off the injuns. In our current crisis, in which we are the conquered people of an ‚Äòinmivasion‚Äô financed and promoted by an enemy and alien government in Tubman DF, our time has now come to re-live the heartbreak of the Iroquois. It‚Äôs only been 300 years.

                Which reminds me. The native peoples of North America lost to the white devil because they were divided into a thousand ‚Äúnations‚Äù and hated each other far more than they hated the invader. The conquerors exploited those hatreds and seized all of it, sea to shining sea‚Ä¶
Which is exactly what has been done to ‚Äúus‚Äù, the ‚ÄúAmerican People‚Äù. We are atomized and/or divided into small tribes aka grievance groups.

                    The American native people lost when they allowed the first White settlers to remain.  If one reads of the very first settlement attempts they were not welcome.  For the first hundred years or so, trade occurred but only temporary encampments for that process.  Then they were ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù to get the hell out.
The first ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù settlements occurred when one tribe, in a weaken state, thought that an alliance with White settlers would strengthen its position among the regional competing tribes.  At that point the game was lost, the rest is commentary.

                    Unfortunately, not yet.  It‚Äôs on the very long list of things we hope to improve.  This area normally gets tons ofrain so it‚Äôs not usually an issue, but there were a lot of tourists in town that day.  We are loathe to cut down any of the large, lovely trees that help shade our cabin.  But the local volunteer fire departments are excellent, and we‚Äôre just a hair over 3 miles from the closest one.  So just need toremain vigilant until we can purchase/make a good fire suppression system.

                    We finally got a bit ofrain after midnight last night.  Not enough, although sufficient (along with my husband cutting the grass) that we had three enormous turkey hens (at least 3.5 feet tall) rooting for bugs out in the yard this morning.

        ‚ÄúIt is the institutional hatred of the past that has become the state religion.‚ÄùThis was a great essay on many levels. Here Zman lays out the great contradiction of our time. Modern democracy is deliberately about constant alienation from the past and confusion in the present. So it cannot be a unifying principle. Instead it‚Äôs just a wrecking ball. This suits the oligarchs just fine, as it great for their depredations.

        That means what comes next must not be a defense of the past, which has already slipped away from us, but a new offensive built around a vision of a new future. What comes next will have to be built on the bones of the democrats, not on what they have destroyed.

        Substitute Leftism for democracy in Z‚Äôs essay and it works just as well, perhaps even better. Beginning with the French Revolution, and continuing with increasing intensity through the Marxist period and now into the postmodern, Leftists have always held past people and societies in contempt. And that it because, in their boundless arrogance, they measure the past against their dismal utopias and find it wanting. If past people and societies were too stupid to see what is plainly best for humanity‚Äìtransfigured reason and the murder of God, communism, deification of negroes and deviants, etc.‚Äìthen they deserve all the scorn, mockery and derision the Left can muster. And in so nullifying the past, the Left unmoors the present populace from its intellectual shackles and enables its entrance into the grand utopian project.

            Antidotes are to be found in surprising places. The wife enjoys older movies and had one on the other day. I cannot remember the name of the film, but it takes place in NYC in the fifties and it‚Äôs in color. One scene shows the protagonist walking down the street attempting to woo Marilyn Monroe and my kids asked where they were. When I told them, they all said , ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs New York City?!?‚Äù I told them yes and got the inevitable follow up, ‚ÄúWhat happened to it?‚Äù so I asked them, ‚ÄúNotice anything, or more to the point anyone missing from the scene?‚Äù It took them a few seconds, but my youngest was the first one to pipe up with, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no blacks, only White people.‚Äù I then pointed out how the streets were clean, no graffiti, look at how everyone is dressed, doesn‚Äôt that look like someplace you‚Äôd like to visit? They nodded in approval.Sometimes a vivid example of compare and contrast can be an eye opener. Not that they needed it mind you, I‚Äôve done a good job preparing them for the hellscape they will unfortunately inherit.

        Rubber will meet the road when the draft efforts come around. Ukraine, is their model but that place on the map (not even a nation) is not the US.Saw my local Fourth of July parade in my neighborhood yesterday. It was cute, neighborhood little kids (ages 5-14) parading around the neighborhood with e-bikes, bikes, scooters, etc. One older boy had a Gadsden flag, lots of little girls with stars and stripes butterfly wings (cute, they were about 6-8). About 99% White though the neighborhood is about 80% White. Organized by a lady with kids as a fun thing.Point being, it was very, very White, but I saw almost none of my local non-White neighbors (who are mostly Asian/Hispanic). Patriotism is just White, White, White. There is no other way to put it.Saw the PBS Fourth celebration (had it on to keep my dogs from going nuts, they do not like fireworks). Every other White guy was gay, in the audience. Smokey Robinson sadly turned into a quavering voiced old woman (not kidding). The White guys there were gay, gay, gay. Believe me that is not the case in my Southern California suburb.Just my observations.

        The only unifying principle for being an American seems to be common humanity (at best) and inhabiting a border and being ‚Äúdocumented‚Äù.

        To be loved, a country (or person), should be lovable. The USA has not done much lately to merit lovability. There are various kinds of democracy. We have the liberal kind, with voting and elections. Such a system empowers the financial elite (which it was intended to do) and actually undercuts what might be called social democracy, wherein Joe Average has access to wealth and  property and a large say in how his own affairs are run. That kind of democracy is the only kind worth having and is incompatible with liberal democracy.

                Wiffle:  I  must disagree.  If one of my sons were to suddenly claim he was a female and undergo surgical mutilation, I would love my memory of who he was, but I would utterly reject his unnatural and debased choices.  He would no longer be my son, nor someone I could possibly love.  Same for AINO ‚Äì in its current, debased form it bears no resemblance to the nation of my youth.  I cannot and do not love its twisted, alien, and ugly composition.  America in tatters is no longer America ‚Äì it is AINO which is to be loathed.

                    So? Does America become beautiful by complaining how ugly she is? Do ugly babies become beautiful by harping about ugly they are? What you think of a mother who kept pointing out all the flaws of her children, rather than working on them?No. We love what is unlovable because it is ours or it is no love at all.I‚Äôm not talking about government forms, by the way. The republic is already dead. Whatever. I‚Äôm talking about the people.‚ÄúHe would no longer be my son, nor someone I could possibly love.¬†‚ÄúHe would always be your son, because surgery does not change him in the least. They only mutilated him.  You will just need to love him more if he was so defeated and discouraged that someone convinced him surgery would make him a woman. That does not mean giving into the fantasy that he is now a woman. But it may mean some very painful encounters where the love is constant, but he may need to figure out on his own that he‚Äôs not woman and never will be.

                        Again, strongly disagree.  First, love is not mere sentiment.  In the Bible ‚Äòlove‚Äô is an action verb.  Loving someone means wanting what is best for him, not accommodating or enabling his delusions.  That type of thought is what leads parents ‚Äì who often claim to be Christians ‚Äì to join PFLAG to ‚Äòlove and support‚Äô a sexually-degenerate child.  Secondly, trying to understand and overcome mental illness with love is a fool‚Äôs errand.  I thank God both my sons ‚Äì although far from perfect ‚Äì are sexually normal and this is not a choice I‚Äôve been forced to make.  Too many make the wrong one.

                            Yes, love is an action verb. That‚Äôs why as a Christian you would never stop loving your son. What I stated was the Christian theology of love, both of sons and nations. I can‚Äôt help it if modern hippies have commandeered the idea of particularly agape love for their own use.I said specifically that love did not mean indulging in what would be fantasies about being a woman. Love has to increase in that situation that I am glad you are not facing. More love is required to to offer kindness, patience, and prayer in that situation without enabling it. It‚Äôs a tall order. Love might even look like loving, concerned social exile. The end of the story will seem a lot like the return of the prodigal son. It will not end in a laundry list of what the son did wrong.Paul explained the nature of love in 1 Corinthians 13.  Love is patient, love is kind, love hopes all things and and endures all things. There‚Äôs more there that I‚Äôm not doing justice to. I‚Äôd encourage reading it over.So too with nations, which are just extended families. We need to be patient and kind and endure to the end, even though they don‚Äôt deserve it. Assuming they are gone and hopeless gets us no where.Jokes are better sometimes, so let me end with one. To me the unpopularity of my thoughts, although well meaning appears to be ‚ÄúThe beatings will continue until morale improves‚Äù. Obviously that does not work in the real world. I may sound like a hippie, but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm offering the only practical solution to improve the situation.

        Z man has argued in today‚Äôs essay that patriotism and democracy are incompatible. Let‚Äôs put it another way: You can have patriotism, or you can have democracy, but you cannot have both. Sound reasonable?(1)Right. Let‚Äôs sort out our terms and what those terms mean and don‚Äôt mean. ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù is not a form of government; it defines the source of legitimacy for a government. We have a republic ‚Äì an actual form of government ‚Äì that requires people like representatives, governors, judges, county executives, mayors, and so on. In general these positions are filled by ‚Äúdirect democracy‚Äù aka voting.* However, many positions are filled by appointment, and that‚Äôs where your ‚Äúrepublic‚Äù shit comes in. No one elected the Supreme Court, for an obvious example. Still, and this is key, the legitimacy of these appointments supposedly derives from the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù, the voters. Yet Presidents can will into existence massive new federal departments, like the DOE under Carter, or DHS under Bush the younger. ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù didn‚Äôt give us these abominations; ‚Äúour‚Äù republic did.The Dems fortify election results and crack down on dissident media precisely because ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù terrifies them. Ergo, democracy isn‚Äôt the problem, and quite honestly, I stopped being ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù when it became clear to me that ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù was no longer the source of ‚Äúlegitimacy.‚Äù(2)Let‚Äôs talk about patriotism. Stalin ‚Äì the GOAT of cynics ‚Äì pulled his empire through WW2 by dubbing it ‚ÄúThe Great Patriotic War.‚Äù Few Russians were going to volunteer to die for Five Year Plans, cramped apartments, food rationing and labor camps, but millions were willing to die (and did die) for the Motherland.** So maybe Z is right; democracy kills patriotism; totalitarianism promotes (and even requires) it. We all know how tenaciously the Germans and Japanese fought in 1944-5 against impossible odds. Can it be that the Left is correct? That patriotism = fanaticism?We Americans failed to settle into ‚Äúblood and soil‚Äù communities and regions. Not all of us, mark you; except for a few unfortunate years in the ‚ÄòHotel California‚Äô (ie DC and environs), I have lived in a particular area that I love. I would never fight for AINO, but I‚Äôd fight for my little corner of it. Blood and soil, baby, blood and soil. Our blog host is terrific and I have read him daily for close to ten years‚Ä¶ ‚Äúputting that aside‚Äù as Z likes to say, Z exemplifies the ‚Äòrootless cosmopolitan‚Äô so disparaged by the Bolsheviks, and in this one subject they had a point.*Fact. Here is ‚Äúdirect democracy‚Äù for you: in a county adjacent to mine, coroner is an elected position.**I know, it isn‚Äôt like they had any say in anything.

        Off Topic.  Col. Macgregor on Judge Napolitano‚Äôs podcast on  07/03/24, said that he believed that the attacks of 10/07/23 were allowed to happen for the purpose of cleansing Gaza, the West Bank and probably parts of Lebanon of the current inhabitants.
Not news to us but it does show that pattern recognition is becoming a thing.

        Z‚Ä¶You keep refering to the U.S. govt as a ‚Äúdemocracy.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how much of this is sarcasm ‚Äúmocking the left,‚Äù and how much is in seriousness.I know you are too smart not to know the U.S. govt is and always has been a representative republic.You are always calling for no return to the past, but you never give an outline for your vision of a restructured U.S. govt. Do you prefer a monarchy? That is a return to the past on steroids. A strong man dictatorship? That is a return to the past, and in some places around the world it is the present.I don‚Äôt agree with a no return to the past policy. Some things worked. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that many people yearn for a return to the 50‚Äôs and the 80‚Äôs.The 80‚Äôs were basically a kind of 50‚Äôs light. There was economic prosperity combined with a watered down, cultural conservatism reminiscent of the 50‚Äôs amongst all the hedonism of the 80‚Äôs. An odd witch‚Äôs brew but, by and large people were happier, or at least less discontented.The thing I cannot understand is the more the left has their way, and they have had everything their way since Obama, with only a four year speed bump of Trump, the more miserable and radical they are. Same as the more the feminists get their way, the more miserable they are, and the more radical they become. It makes zero sense.It would be nice if you did a friday show out lining YOUR vision of what the ideal form / structure of govt would be after this current mess goes belly up.I‚Äôd say happy 4th, but I am currently anti patriotic.

                How bout men sack up, take away what women and minorities have squandered with zero fuck‚Äôs given about what they think, or especially their fucking ‚Äúfeelings.‚ÄùI‚Äôm the most hated man in the blogosphere.

                ‚Äú‚Ä¶a return to the 1820s, with only men of property voting and the State legislatures picking the electors,‚Ä¶‚ÄùAll suggestions for political reform need to be grounded in the possible, not the ideal.  For example, repeated suggestions of who should not vote perhaps misses/ignores the essential point of ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù.  So would the requirement of ‚Äúmen of property‚Äù produce better voters today?  Perhaps.  But what does men of property mean today? It was in the past a proxy for having a stake in the nation and the proven ability to work to successfully acquire a claim to direct its affairs.  Today, I suspect not so much.I like the concept of ‚Äúearned suffrage‚Äù and less the concept of ‚Äúexclusion‚Äù simply based upon unalterable aspects of one‚Äôs self.  The latter seems lazy thinking, and if lazy, probably self defeating.  For example, more than half the country‚Äôs population are of the fairer sex.  Will they will vote themselves out of political power? Doubtful.So we then are left with establishing an authoritarian regime so powerful as to cause these things through diktat.  Why have voting at all, when we have a King.

                    That‚Äôs a good post. I favor allowing women to vote, but in a system where blocs are weighted. Generally speaking, women‚Äôs votes would be weighted considerably less than men‚Äôs. This would allow them to feel they have a stake in the country without allowing their more pernicious traits to damage it electorally.

            The thing I cannot understand is the more the left has their way . . . the more miserable and radical they are. Same as the more the feminists get their way, the more miserable they are, and the more radical they become. It makes zero sense.
It makes perfect sense.  What they want sucks and leads to misery, so that is what they get. Unfortunately dragging the rest of us along with them.

            You‚Äôll never get it either. Ever notice the themes? Your US of A is dead. Crisis! Doomporn. Bitterness. Can‚Äôt even grill once a year on the 4th without getting mocked or turning it into a joke. This bright new future without democracy sounds just like a global techocracy but you saw what happened when they was slipped that directly into the themes with the ‚ÄúLinkedin conservatives‚Äù article. The audience didn‚Äôt care for it too much.
