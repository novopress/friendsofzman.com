        Governors sign bills, they veto bills, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad reasons, and sometimes for no reasons at all.  That’s what Governors do.  It’s their job. Absent any overt criminality involved, their decisions should not be legally assailable.What the prosecutor has done—in a blatant political attack with eyes on the 2016 presidential election—opens the door for his own decisions and actions to be subject to similar legal scrutiny.  And if the courts make the mistake of failing to pay proper deference to the decision making authority of the state’s chief executive officer, a case can be made that the legal opinions and actions of judges are likewise subject to the same legal jeopardy.

        Austin is to Texas as southern New Hampshire is to Massachusetts.  Lots of transplants there who left someplace else, which they royally f*cked up and laid waste until they picked up and left, and are now doing the same to their latest victim.  Like a bunch of locusts, they ravage an area and move on.

        Well. Travis County. Austin. Their slogan, “Keep Austin Weird” is more than just a slogan to those guys. Great place to go see some live music. But way too many pretend Texans there, any more.
