        Trump wields a weapon the press and the politicians can’t deal with.  Common sense!

            The media is oppressive, but it is a herd. Trump is the border collie. We thought they were wolves, but Trump knew them as sheep dressed in wolves clothing.

        One of your best yet. I really like your political analysis and think you should do it regularly on the podcast.  I will be dropping segments of this from gab on my normie friends to slowly redpill them up to speed
Years and years of euphemisms, excessive politesse, and lying have gotten us to the point where we have a lot of big fat whoppers blocking everyones’ view of reality.
Calling a shithole a shithole and listening to the Z-man helps clear this stuff out of the way

        Talk about synergy-  yesterday’s Sh*tStorm! combined with today’s Ghetto Life and AfroFuturism.   Following that up with H8er History is a felonious act of noticing.

            Let me make sure I have this right.  Trump, in a heated and private discussion, got rough in negotiations, and may or may not have used a specific word, which may or may not have applied to Haiti as well as Africa.  Somebody leaks the use of this word, without much context at all, to the press, and everyone who hates Trump, from the Democrats to the racialists, to the UN, gets the vapors.  The world has truly gone crazy.Now this stuff is going to be repeated 24/7 for weeks, orchestrated by the media, Facebook, and Google.  Agitation will continue.  What is already turned up to eleven in a bunch of people’s heads will get turned up to twelve.  Just shoot me now, get it over with.

                Because I’m a masochist I have been listening to NPR almost nonstop for the past couple days. The soy boys at NPR are clutching pearls and clucking at Trump’s “vulgar language” and the obvious latent racism behind his comments.
Out here in flyover country anyone with half a brain realizes that Trump is saying what everyone else is thinking. Not sure if it was deliberate, but it was a genius move.

                    I agree.
The “shithole countries” comment went into being the next “deplorables” meme in about 5 seconds flat.
The media in general is pulling a fit , but everybody I know thinks the comment is the greatest thing ever.

                Ah, no one we care about will care about that. Its entirely true anyway
Frankly the normies know its true as well and won’t care. No one other than people wanting exploit them or faith cucks, oh sorry I repeat myself cares about Haitians or a lot of these places
You can’t guilt President Trump into a bad deal on DACA or anything else like the Left thinks. As usual they project rabbit warren logic onto someone who isn’t a rabbit

                    Love the “as usual they project rabbit warren logic onto someone who isn’t a rabbit.”
Can’t decide if Trump is actually a full on Wolf in amongst the warren bunnies…. or just the kind of Big Dog able to catch &amp; chomp a bunny any time he feels like it….. Or just bat them back &amp; forth with his paws….

                    I wish some Christian leader would sit down and go through the Bible and come up with the rationale to defend one’s family, country, and home from foreign invaders and thieves – because that’s what these people are; the foreign invaders, the public assistance cheats, and their enablers. And then start teaching it.It’s there, but none of them will speak of it.This is the problem with Christianity. None of the leaders will stand up and speak the truth.It’s another case of pretending that all the old lies we’ve been telling ourselves for generations are true, when the plain facts available for all to see show them to be not just untrue, but deadly false.But these people are all followers. They need permission and tradition to tell them what to preach, and there is none in this context. So I despair of them coming around in time to stop this before it’s too late.And then, they are making plenty of money under the current arrangements, as Z-man talked about in the podcat, so there’s little motivation for the leadership to change their message to comport with reality.

                Well specifically, the perp here seems to be Dickie Dirtbag from IL.  He has a history of this.  Growing up in S. Florida, had exposure to Haitian refugees (including the dead ones that washed up on the beach periodically)  The place was such a shithole that any fate was better than the Duvaliers and the Ton-tons.  But even in the complex refugee hierarchy of S. Florida in those days, the Haitians firmlyanchored the bottom.  Mostly illiterate, Creole speaking, malnourished, generally low IQ and with no skills, the local relief agencies were pretty much flummoxed with what to do with them.  “Little Haiti” neighborhoods were not places you visited.

                    Trump used Durbin (a total fool) to get a message to his base: “I know I sounded like a pussy with all that love talk the other day, but that was something I had to do to sound ‘bi-partisan.’ Don’t worry,  shithole is how I really feel.”

        A regular feature on ghetto life is a good idea. People who live outside the ghettos know that they shouldn’t visit them, but that’s the totality of what they know about what goes on there. You could help dispel the myth that ghetto problems are all the fault of The Honkey Oppression.

                The Disingenuous White Liberals and the Sanctimonious White Conservatives love blacks.  Just love them, love them, love them and want to stay as far away as possible from them.
Liberals have saying for I don’t know how long that “prejudice is ignorance.”  That sometimes true, but IMO, “familiarity breeds contempt” is at least equally true.

        Excellent point about how MA and CA are not the epicenters of progressive lunacy in the US.  It’s a point I have been trying to make to people for a good long time.  Being a MA resident it’s hard to deny that there is quite a bit of leftist lunacy out here.  But even then,  we don’t have people running around pulling down statues,  Antifah riots, or schools that very consistently allow their students to go berserk (Berkeley).RE: Wisconsin – birthplace of American progressivism. A quick search brings up the ethnic makeup of Wisconsin – and it’s 42% German.Another quick search of history of socialism in the US has the following in the wiki page:  ” Labor activists—usually British, German, or Jewish immigrants—in 1877 founded the Socialist Labor Party. ”In 1938 Garet Garrett wrote in “The Revolution Was” (referring to the FDR Administration’s restructuring of the federal govt) :” Worse outwitted were those who kept trying to make sense of the New Deal from the point of view of all that was implicit in the American scheme, charging it therefore with contradiction, fallacy, economic ignorance, and general incompetence to govern.But it could not be so embarrassed, and all that line was wasted, because, in the first place, it never intended to make that kind of sense, and secondly, it took off from nothing that was implicit in the American scheme.It took off from a revolutionary base. The design was European. Regarded from the point of view of revolutionary technique, it made perfect sense. Its meaning was revolutionary and it had no other. For what it meant to do, it was from the beginning consistent in principle, resourceful, intelligent, masterly in workmanship, and it made not one mistake.”There is a crucial point here I believe.  One that the alt-right and people like yourself are trying to make over and over again in regards to dragging in immigrants from “shithole” countries like Somalia (or pretty much any country in the African continent) , Haiti, Mexico – etc.That point is – that you will not keep the country you have – if you continually allow it to be subsumed under a wave of immigration.  As you point out over and over again:  magic dirt theory does not work.Wisconsin = 42% German.Midwest in general : lots of German descended people. States like Minnesota have their own fair share of progressive lunacy too- and seem to think that Somali immigrants are a good idea.According to Wiki – American socialism came about from British, German, and Jewish labor activists (there’s that German thing in there again)I believe we’ve already run the experiment on whether magic dirt works or not at least once in the history of this country – and seen the inevitable results.  Immigration is a good way to subsume the earlier order – again – we’ve run the experiment.Progressivism along the lines of what we’ve been stuck with for more than 100 years – is not something that originated in this country.  It originated from immigrants when that magic dirt thing didn’t work to bring them in line with the original founding ideals.  As much “progress” (regress?)  as the alt-right and people like Trump have been able to achieve – and may achieve in the future – I think we would have all been better off if we never had to go this far down the shit pipe in the first place.

            Mensheviks vs Bolsheviks.
Perhaps the same strain that tends to colonize, also has a radical fringe?
One sub-group that see opportunity looking outward, whose members (males) are willing to explore foreign environments;
The other sub-group stays home and colonizes inward
Is this strain emphasized in certain demographics, waxing and waning over generations?   Can it be stereotyped?

        Lately, my “husband” has been complaining that his “hegemonic masculinity” hurts, but he refuses to see a doctor.  How can I encourage him to take care of this?  My internal dialogical self, i.e., the voices in my head, prompted me to put the question to the collective wisdom of the Zman commentariat.   I have noticed my “husband’s” “hegemonic masculinity” seems weak and anemic, as he cooked dinner the other night and did not repeatedly compliment his own culinary ability/ask (tell) me several times if dinner was good even after I said it was delicious, as a typically “hegemonically masculine” “male” is wont to do.  I am very concerned.  Please help.

            Seduce him and get aggressive with it.  His pain will magically go away.  If it doesn’t, do it again.  If it still doesn’t go away after two times around the block, stop the treatment and wait for him to figure it out.  If he can’t figure it out by then, chalk it up to a failure of an IQ test.  And have him get his prostate checked out.

        An official chain-migration estimate from a couple decades back: for each lawful immigrant, about 40 (yes, forty) more can legally enter the U.S.
It occurs to me to wonder if the chained-migrants (there’s an image for ya) are counted in the currently-official legal-immigration statistics.

            Trump showed what a master of reality he is.Anyone with any sense realizes he’s just telling the truth for a change. That includes a wide swath of leftist lemminghood, which is admitting to itself privately that he is right, and so slowly being redpilled.At the same time he reinvigorated his base, many of whom might have been having private doubts because of some of the palaver he was emitting to set up the media and the Dems.Of course, there are a few holdout loser leftists like you who act like this is some big racist faux pas, but even those know in their heart of hearts that all Trump did was say what everyone else knows but is afraid to admit for fear of “offending” someone.
