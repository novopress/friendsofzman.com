            That’s what empire means, by the way: demand raw materials, oil, and manufactures from the rest of the world and demand that they pay for it. And then call this system ‘democracy’ and ‘rules-based order.’ It’s a system of extortion by lawless gangsters who make Capone, Genovese, and Luciano look like boy scouts.

        The spirit of the age is girl power and the usual suspects fit right into this spirit with their verbal skills.It kind of reminds me of the deception of Eve. There really are principles in that book worth considering.The deception is that they can do all this crap without the use of brute physical force. Once the only option is brute force both at home and abroad well we know that those nations of peoples whom still operate with a masculine spirit may do the unthinkable and slap the feminine spirit of our age.At one time in our culture slapping a hysterical woman was not unthinkable.Thats what we are ruled by now the spirit of a hysterical woman on the playground who is just asking to get slapped.

            “At one time in our culture slapping a hysterical woman was not unthinkable.”
That would be a mild response at that.  Hysteria, a form of panic, in the military gets you shot.  The few times I witnessed such, it was a woman responding to some sort of accident which required immediate action.  Heaven help you—in such a situation you’d die in the arms of a crying woman.

I still remember reading “With the Old Breed” and the author tells of a time a soldier simply loses it in the foxhole, to the point the other soldiers have to kill him to keep enemy forces from finding their location.
The writer has nothing but sympathy, and those soldiers likely had a mental wound that never healed. Still, they did what they had to.

                    Sounds like the scene in Spielberg’s War of the Worlds where Tim Robbins’ character basically goes to pieces and threatens, through his deranged recklessness, to expose Tom Cruise and his daughter to the aliens. Cruise has little choice but to confront and kill Robbins, which he does.

                        I don’t recall that from the movie, but as long as the character identified as a WASP hetero male, I guess it was ok.

                        Since we’re talking movies. I thought immediately of one of the Aliens movies where a male soldier freaks out and starts yelling “Game over man!” in panic as the aliens corner them. The pozzed filmmakers contrasted this behavior with the calm demeanor of the butch lezbo female soldier. Speaking of slapping, someone needs to slap the people who make movies like this and explain to them that that’s not what happens in the real world. The movie is about aliens but this little vignette is far more unbelievable than the idea of parasitic space aliens with acid for blood.

                    That’s why I detest war and “gang ho” movies.  The things you have to do to stay alive and more importantly win.  I believe such a moral dilemma was illustrated in the (true story) movie “Lone Survivor?” About a team mission in Afghanistan where the squad was to take out an Afghan insurgent, but met up with a civilian boy and father.  The SOP was to kill them and complete/abort the mission.  They would not do this.  The boy and father ran to the village and alert the populace.  Everyone was tracked down and killed except the “lone survivor”.

                            Ostei:  Problem is that compassion gets you killed in both a hot and a cold war, as well as a war in which only one side is actually fighting.  Whites and western civilization are in a war for their very survival, but most don’t even notice it, or truly believe deep in their gut that their IKAGOs want them dead.  I have no ‘compassion’ for the enemies of my children, of all races and religions – and all ages.  An alien child is still the promise of an existential threat and must be removed by any means necessary.

            The spirit of the age was perfectly encapsulated by that young girl who was standing confident and proud against the charging bull, in front of Wall Street. Complete and utter obliviousness to the real world.
These two statues have now been moved apart, though. I was actually surprised that happened.

                The girl kept getting “defaced” from what I hear – adult toys and obscene signs attached to her advertising her “services”, though people stopped short of graffiti. Hellofit was the bull gets the same, but more punked and more prankish stuff than anything borne out of disdain.

        When the ape-men and aliens write the history of the American empire in 1000 years, I think Antony Blinken will play a prominent part in the chapters on the downfall. He’s such a perfect emblem of the decayed rot of the empire. It’s obvious his career in government is because of who he is and who he knew (like his stepfather), he has no skill or talent, he got his job as a reward for setting up the Hunter Biden laptop “hallmarks of Russian disinformation” letter for Brandon, he cares more about playing guitar than conducting diplomacy, and the only thing he can say with any conviction is that he is Jewish and has relatives who died in the Holocaust. Yet, he pays no price for any of this and in fact is amply rewarded. He will leave government and make millions of dollars on the GAE speaking circuit, for the WEF/NED/CFR/etc. I know that he’s not *really* in charge of the State Department, but the issue is that the people who are, are exactly like him in every way – people with no conception of objective reality or limits, who believe that truth is the opinion of the powerful.

FromChimptonius’s Lives of the 12 Presidents:
And one Antonius Blincenus, who was a nebbish managerial type, from Judaea, and had depraved sexual tastes, did have the confidence of Josephus Bidenus, who himself did lose his bowels in public.
Of course we will get the account of Ape-Man Edward Gibbon, no funny name required, 1500 years later.

        In the artificial reality in which these people live, the ought is the same as the is.You nailed it right there. The People in Charge(kind of, they are indeed just managers) have no connection to or perception of limits. They thought they could meme MAGA, Putin and now China out of existence. Unlike delusional conservatards who vote harder, these types meme harder. It is the same delusion all the way down.There probably actually are a few folks among the real TPTB who realize an economic war with China would impoverish them, so that is less likely to happen than a nuclear exchange with Russia. The irony there is delicious.We are dealing with people who cannot conceive of their own deaths and a world in which they do not rule. This has been a pattern throughout history. Those of us caught in the midst of their madness all will suffer as a direct result. There is absolutely no way for them to back down because actual consequences are an alien concept to them. Get ready and prepared, folks, because they are about to cross a line than cannot be uncrossed if they have not already done so.

        The USA has been a bully since the days of Theodore Roosevelt and his ” bully pulpit.” Trouble is that the USA doesn’t know how to speak softly anymore. We’re at the point of put up or shut up but the usual suspects don’t know how to shut up and they don’t have the big stick they thought they had. This is going to get interesting.

        Escalatory dominance and presumption of abundance are kind of the same thing. The latter manifests economically, in all kinds of silly ideas, like the climate “industrial” complex, UBI, reparations, and endless  loldollars. Having never known deprivation or even modest failure, since only economic success has ever been known,it is unfathomable that anything can destroy the economy. Since the people who ran the economy of the past were racist white men, then ipso facto our ideas, whatever they are, must be better. And certainly they have to be different, because we can’t do the same things the evil racist white men did.We are presently ruled by people who came of age in the dot com bubble and the historically outlying roaring stock market of the 80s and 90s, and they think that’s normal. Even when there was a “crash” in ’08 the loldollars came to the rescue. Failure is less conceivable than gay purple unicorns.

            One could make the same argument about their attitudes toward western civilization. Ergo, Western civilization has endured, with occasional hiccups for close to 3,000 years, and therefore it always will endure regardless of whatever violence we inflict upon it.
That’s one way of looking at it. But there is another–Western civilization is the creation of the Blue-eyed Ice Devil and we must, therefore, destroy it.
The latter strikes me as much more plausible.

                I’d say it’s both of those. We’re not destroying western civilization, but it’s a good thing that we are. The choice depending on how cute they’re feeling that day.

            The scene from “Ender’s Game” comes to mind.  He is bullied by a fellow cadet during training for “space war” against an alien race.  He lures/awaits the bully into the shower and turns, blinding him with hot water, then cold cocking him—which kills him.  During debriefing, he is questioned why he did not end the conflict and leave when he had blinded the bully and was then safe to retreat.  He said that the first contact was to protect himself from harm, the second (the seemingly unnecessary one) was to assure he would never have to defend himself against this bully again.Ender was promoted to “team leader” as this answer was precisely what the trainer was looking for in a recruit and instinctively known to Ender.  So the answer is…when the enemy is down, indeed, put him down permanently!

        The problem with this analysis is the fact that the targets of Western “bullying” have so far failed to establish a credible deterrent, and therefore they are enabling the West to get away it. It would be nice if someone actually stood up to the bully, but those who have (or had) the power to do so have been very reluctant to defend themselves.In the first case, we have Donald Trump. If he just would have put a little more effort into actually enacting the platform that he originally campaigned onand won on,he would not be in this position today. Trump made no serious attempts to drain the swamp. No sooner did he get to the swamp than he decided to kick back in a floatie with a margarita, right in the middle of the swamp. The people who elected Trump in 2016 actually wanted to see Hillary Clinton go to jail. They did not want to hear from Trump about what a good person she was, not 24 hours after he was elected. Hillary is not a good person and she needs to go to jail. Trump needed to jail her, if not for justice’s sake, then at least for the safety of the world and for his own political survival. The current disaster in Ukraine is in many ways a direct result of Hillary’s completely fabricated “Russian Collusion” hoax. Many of us knew something like this would happen back in 2016. We elected Trump to stop it, we gave him the mandate to stop it, and he did not stop it. He put himself in this position.In the second case, Russia’s SloMO operation in Ukraine is completely absurd at this point. Russia could have ended this war two years ago by targeting the Kiev regime and taking out the Ukrainian leadership. Defenders of The Duran strategy have repeatedly told us that things would change after May 21st, when Zelensky’s constitutional position as the head of the Ukrainian state became questionable. Well, May 21st came and went, and nothing whatsoever has changed about Russia’s posture. When we question why Russia is not prosecuting the war more forcefully, we hear that Russia views this as a “brother war” and is not interested in inflicting mass destruction and slaughter on the Ukrainians. This is manifest nonsense on stilts. First of all, brothers or not, wars do the least amount of long-term when they are finished quickly and decisively, as Machiavelli taught. Secondly, Russia’s actual behavior of steadily chewing up and killing half a million of their “brothers” in uniform bears no similarity to this explanation. If Russia would just pick up the pace and finish the damn war already, we wouldn’t now be talking about Western-backed saboteurs attacking their strategic radar stations. Russia’s dillydallying has allowed the West to continue to antagonize Russia in an even greater degree than before, and none of the strategic goals of the SMO have been realized. We are 28 months into this thing, andDonetsk Cityis still being shelled, for crying out loud. This is ridiculous.In the third case, China is being extremely foolish in letting these diplomatic insults go unanswered. Xi did nothing but huff and puff while Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan. He did nothing but turn a cold shoulder to Anthony Blinken. China has enough financial leverage to completely destroy the American state without firing a shot, simply by offloading their US Treasury holdings.Instead of doing that, they continue to fund an enable the very entity that is menacing them.Iran’s “demonstration” against Israel was carefully calibrated to avoid doing any actual damage, while Palestinian children are being blown to pieces by US bombs inside UN-established safe zones.This is so absurd that I struggle to talk about it without losing my mind. The people with the power to stand up to the bully need to freaking do it already. Otherwise, all the talk about how “these guys never got into a schoolyard fight” is looking increasingly beside the point.

That wouldn’t have ended anything, it would have only escalated it, then or now. Russia knows this, which is why they haven’t done it. What, you think that if the Russians sack Kiev/kill Zelensky, then the GAE is just going to say tough break mate, let’s go home, we’ll get ’em next time?

                    Correct in that it does apply to most anything Russia might do. They are in a very difficult position, in which they had no choice but to act, yet there was no choice they could make which would lead to “victory,” at least not in the short term.

                        Putin already has advisors in Russia, both official and unofficial, who say the same things I do. Medvedev and Dugin are two names that come to mind. He just doesn’t listen to them. The lackadaisical approach is making a nuclear war more likely, not less. Putin is a good man and much better than any Western leader, but he’s not a wartime consigliere.

                    Maybe, given that with each passing day Russia gets stronger and the US gets weaker, the right strategy is to bleed the US dry while it thinks its bleeding Russia dry?  Russia is to look out for Russia,  not solve our internal problems for us.China could dump US Treasuries, and has been, but an economic collapse of the US would not leave China unscathed.  So it is a tricky situation which so far they have navigated pretty well. The US seems to be the crazy homeless guy accosting everyone on the subway and thrashing around; Russia and China are strong guys just watching and making sure they stay out of striking range.

                I’m not sure what you think is the Duran’s problem.  The 2 Alexs are English-speaking Greeks who have absolutely no pull or influence on Putin.
They are merely commenting on events as they are in a way that is Pro-Russian.
I have heard them make comments from time to time acknowledging that the trade-off for an attrition war is that it gives time to the enemy to play dirty tricks.

                    I don’t think the Duran has any influence on Putin. I think they they share a perspective of Western leadership that is outdated.
To date the Duran has largely ignored the very real possibility that current Western will never come to its senses and that, for various reasons, the peoples of the West will be unable to elect new leadership which will dial down the level of conflict.

                Well, that may have been the case, but I think they are learning that the West (at least the so-called leaders), aren’t playing with a full deck, nor have any comprehension of the clear signs that the Russians have been giving that they consider the West’s fuckery to pose an existential threat to them. The West’s misleaders think that they are presenting as frightening “mad dogs”, but the Russians and the  Chinese are poised to become the Real McCoy “mad dogs”, and the West’s military, not to mention its perilously fragile economies and societies, is in no condition to take the punishment that they can impose, something our delusional “elites” seem not to grasp.

        “Soon, the bluff will be called over Ukraine and Taiwan. Once this happens, the regime has no answer other than the unthinkable.”Well that is a cheery thought.  But I cannot say you are wrong.  Our rulers are irrational about the current state of the country, especially its military capabilities.  They seem blind to the failure of their actions vs Russia, both on the Ukranian battlefield and sanctions.President Puddin’head frequently says, “we’re the USA, of course we can do that.”  Whether it’s fight Russia and China and the middle east, absorb millions of aliens or spend trillions on the green new deal.

Their tech in this department isn’t all that great anyway.  But blinding the world’s largest nuclear power to an incoming attack forces them to assume the worst.

                    FWIW, the US still tests the warheads from time to time, only without fissile material.
The missiles (delivery system) tests are so-so, but I’m told that the tricky part of a nuclear bomb is the explosives around the fissile material detonating perfectly.
Definitely an X factor though.
Pretty sure the Chinese nukes work.
Completely sure the Israeli one’s do (and they’re dying to use them)

                There is an interested theory floating around that the attack on those radar stations was not to blind Russia to a NATO attack, but rather blind Russia to an Isreali attack on Iran and to prevent Russia from warning their Iranian allies.
It is possible that the U.S. had nothing to do with targeting that radar station, That it was encouraged by Mossad, and that Israel is planning a nuclear bunker-busting operation on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities in the near future.

                Russia is no dummy.  They have for a long time anticipated a first strike leadership knockout blow.  To that effect, they have their nukes on a “dead man” switch.  Their nukes literally communicate to the authorities and ask whether or not they are “alive”.  No response initiates the nukes remaining to let loose.  All we’ve done is make them less able to stop such due to false alarm.

        I keep wondering at what point will the Russians say enough is enough?  While I find it hard to imagine them attacking a NATO target or targets as that would truly kick off WW3, with all these pussies (real or soy) talking tough about launching long range missile attacks deep into Russia, the evidently unexpected may come to fruition.  Hell, maybe that’s what TPTB want anyway – wipeout western civilization.  Maybe Russia realizes this and is acting accordingly – at least for now.

At least a portion of TPTB desire WW3 to cancel their debts and declare martial law. Problem is, the CBDCs are nowhere near ready for prime time.
Heck, at this point in 2020 we were already months into the Beer Flu hoax and almost two weeks into the Summer of Love psyop.

            NATO and the west did everything in their power to declare war against Russia after a missile attack killed some innocent farmer in Poland.
When it turned out that he was killed by the Ukrainians, it was “oh, mistakes happen” and never mentioned again.

                “NATO and the west did everything in their power to declare war against Russia after a missile attack killed some innocent farmer in Poland.”That’s factually incorrect. Key players declared Ukraine responsible for that “misfire” almost instantly and Zelensky was the only relevant figure denying (only initially) Ukraine’s responsibility and trying to blame Russians to increase NATO’s involvement.It changes nothing, TWGH is right, “TPTB desire WW3 to cancel their debts and declare martial law”, but what other realistic choices does the West have? It has nothing to offer BRICS, other than concessions at the expense of the frontline countries, but that’s spending assets only to delay inevitable confrontation.

        All the political terrorism of the last 10-15 years has rested on the assumption nobody will shoot back at them.  That’s Ukraine in a nutshell.  They assumed Reddit and Twitter could beat bullets and artillery and air strikes.The Government Party isn’t completely wrong, domestically.  Nobody shot back at them during all the riots.  Those who did try to push back were quickly arrested and charged with phony baloney crimes.  Ala Trump, J6, and that kid up in Minnesota.The general consensus here is that nobody will shoot back.  I think this is right, at least for now.  Most people, faced with gangster government, have looked for ways to either join the gang (Republicans), or just keep their heads down so as not to draw the ire of the gang (normal people).The bully, thus far, has survived because nobody wants to escalate to something worse than the FBI kicking down your door, followed by 24/7 State Media character assassination, and a corrupt judge banning you from defending yourself while the FBI indicts any effective lawyer who defends you.At some point, however, human nature will prevail.  Human nature eventually sees a new gang emerge to challenge the old one.  That’s why they spend so much time calling Trump some hybrid version of a mob boss and mustache man.  He’s the rival gang, and all the usual threats haven’t worked.  In traditional DC politics, even the threat of an indictment (let alone four actual indictments) leads to a tearful press conference and a retirement from politics.Trump keeps forcing them to escalate, leading to even more bizarre actions.its why I keep saying their only option left is to kill him.  But that then opens the door for people to find and kill Democrats and bureaucrats.  I’m not sure they’ve reached the level of crazy required to protect that many people from entrepreneurial warriors.

It is more likely that at the moment of crisis, they will stab in the back anyone who decides to take a stand.  They would rather lose with their principles intact.

                Reminds me of a childhood memory.  This would have been late ’50’s, maybe 4th grade, when we had an real playground bully at school. He was bigger and stronger, from an upper grade, so he didn’t threaten, he actually kicked, punched slapped etc.  Again , this was the 50’s, so within broad limits the teachers didn’t much care.  I was a particularly small and nice kid, so I came in for more than my share of pain.Until one day I picked up a bat, snuck up behind him, and hit him on the head as hard as I could.I was of course suspended for a day.  I remember my Mom making it like a holiday, with a picnic in the park, cake etc.  My status with the teachers as a nice kid didn’t seem to change.  Nobody seemed particularly upset with me.Not sure what happened to the bully.  We never saw him again..

I still don’t know why every Trump voter and non-leftist didn’t walk off their job in November 2020 and bring the country to a halt until the “election” coup was walked back. (I mean, I do know – we take responsibility for the functioning of society. Be we all should have.)

                    Most people do still trust the system.  Today’s kangaroo court ends that I think for most people.i think we should target the courts.  There’s no law against going to jury duty and making a mess of things.  The judges sit on thrones.  We need to start showing up and telling them point blank “you’re corrupt and the Trump thing proves it”I would make civil disobedience in the jury duty scam a weapon.  Again, nothing illegal, but when asked if you can be a fair juror, reply “You mean like the Trump jury in NY?  You don’t want a fair jury.  You want a rigged jury.”Or, if you can afford a few days off, hop on a jury and acquit anybody accused by the government of anything.  The more hung juries, the better.

                It’s going to take a high profile assassination on the D side.  A judge, a pol, maybe a media celeb.  This is one of those things where everyone is waiting for someone else to get the ball rolling.  To z’s point, escalation works until the bully gets punched in the face, shot, stabbed, or bloodied in some manner.
I don’t know if it’ll happen, but if it does, it’ll open the door for more shots to be taken.

        Good analysis.I would say that things are probably even worse that you state; because the Western leadership class are not pretending to be mad dogs in order to attain particular objectives – but ultimately, those who wield most power really are *literally* insane (and not in a nice way!).By insane, I mean “they” are incapable of being truthful (when truth is the common sense of normal people – such as that mass-starvation, -disease and -violence are bad things we ought to try and avoid); incapable of keeping agreements; and indifferent to horrible real-world consequences of their actions – even when bad outcomes will almost certainly badly affect themselves.Such it is to be motivated by spiteful destructiveness.

The war could have been avoided with compromise.  It’s a thing folks did in the olden days.  It was called “diplomacy”.  They had other stuff back then, too, like “negotiations”.
That took brains and a willingness to compromise.  Those don’t exist any more in the West, from what I see.

        Apparently the way that Red Hot Chili Peppers came into being was that one day in school Flea was bullying some random kid by holding him in a headlock, when Anthony Kiedis, then new at the school, saw what was happening and told Flea to let the kid go or he was going to get his ass beat. Flea took one look at Anthony, decided he was serious, and let the other kid go. They became lifelong friends and formed one of the biggest rock bands ever together.I wonder if things like that can happen anymore. I feel bad for kids today if they can’t.

            I hated the RHCP when I first saw them – in the late 80’s, with Hillel Slovak still in the band. I’m no hater, but “Sea Shanties and all ’round Shite” should be the title of their compilation.I am a musician and a music fan: so listen, please, to Bill Orcutt.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOcmES6PWEs

        Just as an aside, I was up a little late last night finishing up some rerun I’d seen dozens of times before on Pluto. I decided to watch the news. They had some multicultural woman doing the CBS News and I decided I didn’t really want to look at some Pakistani (or whatever she is) face, so I changed the channel. ABC had some black woman but I wasn’t interested in the story.Then I get to NBC and Lester with the big forehead Holt. I like Lester. I can’t complain about him too much. Julie something or another (I forgot her last name but it was Armenian) was reporting some dumb story that was total propaganda. It was about the massive exodus of people from Florida because of Ron DeSantis’ politics, including some self-proclaimed “moderate conservative.”I stopped watching the news because I got bored of it. I feel bad because I feel like I should be better informed, but after watching last night, it completely pissed me off. Now I see why I don’t watch Pravda on the Potomac anymore and stick to following these kinds of pages, which also has a certain amount of risk.

            Lester Holt and his crew are unwatchable.  One of the other networks has a bunch of goofy looking anchors and reporters.  I like to watch that one because it is mildly amusing to watch the oddballs.  They had some weather chick with a porn-star name that made me laugh.The ads are a laugh too.  Its obvious their audience is a bunch of brain-dead geriatrics. Who else can watch that vacuous garbage?As for content, the dearth of real information never ceases to amaze me.    Example:  There was some drug that folks couldn’t get.  It used to be real cheap and now there was a shortage.  They showed a couple of sob stories of folks saying how they needed the drug but couldn’t get it.  “Back to you, Lester”.  “Thanks, Bob.  Next, how these puppies are making Youtube history…”Wait, wait wait.  WHY is there a shortage?  When did it start? What is being done about it?  None of that information was offered up.  What a crappy product.  Besides the fact its all lies.

        The problem is how much computerization has infiltrated society. The powers that’d be think things operate logically and inflexibly, like a computer program. The powers that be also think that they can waive their magic wand and make things happen, in the same way they can design a computer program.One of the more amusing things to me is how they think they actually think they have the power to make self-driving vehicles work. I mean, there are literally billions of different types of decisions drivers have to make depending on what some other drivers do, and they think they’re smart enough to program all of that into a computer. Likewise, when it comes to messing with our DNA, cloning and all the other ghoulish things they do with science.It also doesn’t help that the kids coming up have helicopter parents making sure that they’re involved in all kinds of activities as opposed to working at a part-time job at McDonald’s, where they might get some real world experience at the very least some humanity towards other types of people.Whether it’s hubris, lack of common sense, or all of the above, crazy things are definitely happening in society.

            There is an occult element to it as well (and by “it” I mean “the way that computerization has infiltrated society“).Our “betters” – and at the top of that heap is Silicon Valley – truly think themselves Promethians –Magi. They upper eschalons are enthralled to a very subtle but all-pervasive and all-persuasive demon (Lucifer? That’s Promethius, after all!), who tells them that “they can do magic.” They are commited to this false promise in the depths of their hearts.From IT, from digitization, from Silicon Valley, the “posession” has spread through all the upper “ranks” of culture.

        It’s entertaining to characterize our government bureaucrats as incompetent buffoons and ridicule them as such. But those buffoons have jacked up the national debt to $35 trillion, which cannot be repaid (and the EU is in even worse shape). In addition, they may stumble us into a nuclear war, which is not funny at all. And these buffoons have no regards for tangible consequences once their bluffs are called and they are revealed as weak poseurs. They seem to assume that the jackboots will save them no matter what happens. The day of reckoning is coming sooner than most think. May the best man win.

        If more than half the country thinks we are run by lawless gangsters, well the Woke White women want to speak to your manager.This is exactly what the Woke White Women regime wants. What it needs. That is why they imported all those military aged men illegals. Most with extensive criminal backgrounds. It was no more an accident than Elon Musk buying Twitter (funded by DoD to put the brakes somewhat on the wokeness female hysteria).No trust in the system is precisely the goal. It allows rule by force which the female led Left has been hysterically demanding since the 1930s at least. Heck look at the leader of the student Hamas protesters at Columbia. She is the daughter of a very rich Philippines TV personality. Her personal care about Hamasistan or Palestinians is zero. She just wants to be the crusader against the latest anti-White cause. At minimal risk.NOW the same playbook can be mass produced against YT at large. You are guilty until proven non-White. So the (very important) “respec mah authoritah!” Cartman like veneer of legitimacy can be applied to outsourced, mass produced, virtual pogroms against YT.Trump first, you next. THAT has always been the goal.

                Who made those rules and why?  That is really the question.  Until I hear more than a simple, “…because I said so…”. I’ll continue to capitalize specific racial classifications, e.g., White, as I would someone’s name, and reserve lower case, e.g., black, as referring to a color.
Given me a better rule and I’ll change such distinction.

        I think Taiwan is the much scarier proposition. Fortunately, most of the military people I have heard comment on the subject believe China is not yet ready to attack Taiwan and won’t be in the near to medium term. I don’t believe Japan and South Korea are going to help either with Taiwan or the Philippines. I would think Kim would allow the Chinese military to invade South Korea through North Korea should South Korea get involved in a conflict with China. The idea of reunification under North Korea would be too tempting for Kim Jong Un.Time is definitely on their side though. They are growing in power and we are shrinking in power. I really hope we can get through this crisis in leadership before the US is finally dethroned.

        American foreign strategy is like that of Israel, but scaled up to the whole world. Everybody is a bad guy oppressing America, but America will deal with them by any means necessary. It remains to be seen how it all ends.
As for Trump, the process is also a good test for the MAGA crowd and core Americans. How will they react if Trump is thrown in jail? Will they go beyond impotent rage?

        Escalatory Dominance WORKS within the West. Republicucks just assume the fetal position and roll over. This has been the case since at least 1932. Look at Entertainment: Kathleen Kennedy is out blaming the fans for the imminent failure of the “Acolyte” created and produced by Harvey Weinstein’s lesbian assistant. Can’t make this stuff up. The reason for the failure: toxic White male fans. Star Wars is for everyone … that is a black lesbian into space fantasy. This stuff just goes on and on. Kennedy does this because that’s how she got power inside Hollywood. Hollywood is pretty much run now by woke White and black women with axes to grind.It has never failed to work internally. The West’s problem is that Putin and Xi are not immersed in the post-Christian Puritan/Quaker heretic hunting, utopian saved elect belief system so just don’t care about all the wokery. Social pressure from woke White women does not work on them.Trump was predictably convicted on all counts. Biden tonight will give a speech about “democracy” and yank Trump’s Secret Service protection. There may or may not be arrests of other Republicans as discussed among Democrats. Trump will be sent to prison very quickly, maybe even tonight, by the Judge, and Trump certainly will not be on any ballots. He will spend the rest of his life in prison on Kangaroo Court proceedings. The Supremes will NOT set aside the verdict or trial.Biden cruises to re-election, no problems. Republicans will hurriedly have Nimrata Randhawa on a few ballots for token opposition. Even Musk backed away from Trump, saying he is not involved in any talks with Trump. It won’t stop with Trump either, it will grow to other Republicans, and very quickly their backers and then to you and me. Again this will not reach any pushback because the moral atmosphere makes “immigrant” or gay or what have morally superior to any Straight White man. That is inherent in Christianity which pretty much mandates cuckdom, sorry to say.However, all the moral posturing won’t defeat Russian or Chinese or Iranian or even shambolic North Korean missiles. Lawfare won’t even stop the North Korean poop balloons. Our regime is very good at crushing even the minor dissent and reform effort. Against foreign enemies, not so much.

None of that happened. Not even remotely, Star Wars fan. Don’t want to be in a foxhole with you, my man. Too much time with the fantasy sci-fi.

        The way I have put this for years is, “The junta is so low character and stupid that all that they know how to do is hatred, belligerence, lies, and violence.”  All they are able to do is push and push and push.
They are lucky that the enemies that they hate – the core historic white American population (and core white European ones too), and the Russians, Chinese, and Iranians – have the wisdom, patience, investment in being constructive, and forbearance to consistently respond more maturely.

        We see a similar thing shaping up with China. Washington is going out of its way to provoke China over the issue of Taiwan. Various officials have been sent to the island for no other reason than to antagonize the Chinese.
Antagonizing Taiwan is a standard ritual for China, though. It bruises the Chicoms’ egos that they weren’t able to completely eradicate their rivals at the end of the civil war.

            Yep, but also China—even under the CCP—remembers and loathes the “unfair treaties” dictated from the West upon an aging and weak China back in the colonial era.  Taiwan is considered simply an extension of such colonial behavior and therefore an insult to the revitalized nation.

                Taiwan is considered simply an extension of such colonial behaviorTaiwan, while badly contaminated with feminism and other alien stuff, is a reservoir of ancient Chinese culture. Iow, it’s a haven of theFour Olds, some of which was bad of course and some of which remains on the mainland.Xi Jinping Thought requires slavish conformity to a variety of dogmas and goals, including “the building of a community of common destiny for mankind (人类命运共同体)”, one of the Ten Definites. Taiwan is in the way of the Four News and could, if not brought to heel, undermine the progress of the CPPC i.e. the Common Property Party of China. (That’s a calque of the party’s name.) Yes, I’m saying that the CPPC is another faction of globalist pests, more or less, as we ought to expect giventhe strong alien influence upon itduring its rise to power.And yes, Taiwan is considered a “Western” toehold on China. Chinese who understand the intrinsic, ancient, Zionist bias of “Western” civ won’t tolerate this situation if they aren’t Christian or otherwise compromised. (And even then they may not.) It doesn’t matter whether they are traditionalist or Maoist. If the former, they will know that your Zionism is a mortal threat. For the latter, Beijing is like their Zion or Mecca, which is ironic given the aforementioned alien influence. In any case, the latter aren’t inclined to be sympathetic to Israel’s torahs and their old, backwards nonsense. Levites, Jews, etc. want the State of Israel, or a successor state, to be the central state of world government. The contradiction with 中国 (middle country, cental state) is irreconcilable.
