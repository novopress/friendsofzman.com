        Oh, indeed I am well aware of the rules and strategies of most professional sports played on the continent.  I confess to being a little weak on exactly what goes on in cricket or Australian rules football, but then again mostly played by East Indians and other blokes with strange accents and generally not north of the equator.  I get more than my fair share of rounders and Handegg courtesy of the omnipresent US Sports media behemoth.  I do enjoy watching 200-300lb men crush each other whether on ice or field and yes I get the strategy of American football; apparently it involves boring the fans stupid in order to sell beer and Doritos or similar.    My original comment stands; who cares if one Dominican bats 235 on Wednesdays when facing pitchers born in Latvia, but bats 255 on every other day so long as he is only second at bat?

        Our great national nightmare is now over:  Team USA lost at the World Cup kickball championships today.  Lots of people are nevertheless elated about how far the US team went.  Final record:  1 win, 1 tie, and 2 losses.  In a real sport that would be thought a dismal record.  I can understand why ESPN is giddy.  They’ve pushed the WC without mercy in order to make lots of $$$$$ from the broadcasts.  We’ll see how their ratings fare now that the US is out of the competition. As for the many World Cup soccer wing-nuts, they must be suffering dementia from too many headers.  Which raises the question of why concussions in football are viewed with such alarm these days yet concussions from heading a ball that travels in excess of 40 mph in kickball are not. Given the wee-establsihed long-term effects of brain damage this causes, I’d think no concerned parent would ever allow his minor child to head the ball…without a helmet, of course.

        The crucial defect is a lack of statistics?  So we are better off knowing when bubba scratches his left testicle, it more often than not (‘57.6% of the time Jim’) results in a high outside off speed knuckle ball?  Or that the Tennessee Flaming Thumbtacks third string right nose tackle is exactly 3.2 pounds heavier than the average weight of the opposing defensive line?   Nah, give me chav ball any day.

            I would not be surprised if you are typical of soccer fans. Obviously you know nothing of other sports, given your comment. Appreciating most sports requires some knowledge of the rules, the various strategies as well as the relevant ways to compare those strategies. Soccer fans just want to stare open-mouthed at the television with their hands in the air when the result is not to their liking.

        Good for you! I feel the same way about the announcers.  This makes me hate soccer more than ever.  They are Brits or Aussies, can’t tell for sure.  A guy falls down screaming bloody murder, then gets up 2 seconds later running at full steam. Bullshit!  Also who gives a fuck about Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecquador, Chile, or Mexico for that matter? I’m rooting for the Netherlands or Germany.  My white privilege is showing.
