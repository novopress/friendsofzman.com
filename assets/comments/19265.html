        Racism is the immune system of a people.
(1) That’s why it’sgoodfor us, and we (huwites) need more of it, not less.
(2) That’s why they’re attacking it so hard. They want to destroy our racial immune system, because thenwedie. “Anti-racism” is ideological HIV,intentionallyinjected into our brains by people who hate us and want us dead.

                One of the hardest pills to swallow. I still struggle with it, particularly with a half-and-((half)) in-law. I keep reminding myself it’s not about NAJALT.

                        Meme, me, too.  I got over the top by understanding that one person is who he is, but a group of people has a power all it’s own, which converts a culture to the characteristics of the group.

                            Exactly.You’ve got to differentiate between individuals – and “the group” and recognize that the dynamics are different.I’ve been friends with a number of black men over the years.  I can’t say any of them were bad people.  I got along well with all of them. One guy in particular I would consider just a “normal” person.  We could even tell each other “racist” jokes – and laugh about it without getting pissed off at each other.  He was smart and successful in his career path – and still is.In the HBO series “Band of Brothers” there is a scene where the Americans have taken a bunch of Germans prisoner.  They’re gathered in a group – and they find out one of the Germans was born and raised in the US.  Aside from the war – they would have been neighbors and gotten along just fine.But once that prisoner returned to Germany – and put on the uniform – he became the enemy.  And those American soldiers would shoot him down just like they would any other German wearing the uniform.That’s the way I look at blacks, Muslims, women, Mexicans – etc.  It seems I can get along just fine with them as individuals – but once there is a gang of them standing in front of my house with signs saying “Kill Whitey!” – and they’re all bearing torches to burn my house down – well then they’re ALL getting shot – because their skin is their uniform at that point.  I don’t care if I spot a friend’s face in the crowd.  If they didn’t want to get shot – they should have stayed home.It’s a rule of guerilla warfare that each guerilla fighter swims in a sea of friendly helpers who support him.  The same rule applies to all of the lefties, and blacks and women , and Muslims … etc.   All of the radicals simply wouldn’t be able to survive if there wasn’t a community supporting their antics.A random radical from a certain group can just be attributed as an anomaly.  But when you keep seeing the same behavior from people who originate from a certain group – it’s not an anomaly any longer.  It’s a characteristic of the group that manifests over and over again among some of that group’s individual members.

                            Sort of reminds me of ‘Jewbilee’ from south park:
“ElderUhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?
InducteeJunichi.
ElderO-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um… Could you run out and grab some… some of those candles for us? [Junichi leaves, and the attendant locks the door immediately] There we go. Ahem. Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please.”

            “Anti-racism” is ideological HIV, intentionally injected into our brains by people who hate us and want us dead.”This is how any interaction with anti-whites should begin. Put them on the defensive from the get go.The cure for YT delenda est is an even heavier dose.Anti-racism = sub-rosa anti-whitness has been the modus operandi  since the end of WWII. For decades it has crept along largely misunderstood by our tribe.  Then our rulers anointed the Light-Bringer as The One who would take us those final few steps into the multicultural utopia. His first benign act was to half literally throw his white grandmother under the bus. It’s been a steady ratcheting up of public anti-whitness ever since.If they had been more patient and more discreet in upending our civilization they could have serenaded us into oblivion.  Spiking the ball on the 50 turned out to be very very very bad optics.We’ve been shaken out of our stupor and see things for what they are. No matter what they do this genie isn’t going back into the bottle.  The more extreme they get the more they accelerate the natural growth in our numbers.We’ve become a badly damaged people. Converting our swelling numbers into action will require even more negative motivations on the part of our enemies.  Too much agency on our part at this point would be futile. Our enemies are doing a wonderful job in swelling out number, let’s not interfere.  Our day is coming.  Sooner than later. 2020 -&gt; 2024 will be our Rubicon.Trump’s survival or removal will not much change the behavior of the ‘community’. They will become increasingly public and increasingly extreme in their demands and attacks.We don’t need everyone in our tribe, maybe 1/3rd who are willing to act. It’s hard to get an idea of how many even tangentially are in our orbit.  But the increased agitation of our enemies could be interpreted as a good sign that our numbers are significant and rising.Maybe I’m too much of an optimist…

                    I think “is it ok to be White?” Is much better than ‘its ok to be White’ because to criticize it is to answer the question with a no. I think this would be much more effective in waking people up…

        My dad married my English mom while on overseas duty.  Some of my fondest childhood memories were the trips to England to spend time with my grandparents.  Granddad took me everywhere and he was particularly fond of bringing me to watch his beloved Arsenal football club.  It was the 1974 visit when there some rowdy Pakistani and Jamaicans in the crowd; he refused to have me around it so we left early.  This was followed by some time in the Underground with even more of London’s growing vibrancy.  I remember the walk home vividly – Grandad said “These bloody Pakis and Darkies are going to be the ruin of this country, mark my words boy.”He was right.

            Watch the Arsenal Fan TV channel on YouTube.  When they do man-on-the-street reaction videos after each game, the camera is completely framed by bug-eyed, mouth-breathing primates.  It’s insane to realize that it’s being filmed in London and not Addis Ababa.

                I passed though Heathrow in 2008. The lady checking passports was the only other white person I saw there.
While American conservatives are putting up token resistance to the latest liberal outrage, all of America’s vassal states immediately implement the liberal policy without debate. There it’s not liberals vs. conservatives, it’s liberals vs. outright commies. I know not why, but it’s been this way since WW2.

                Drake – then you probably remained in the tourist areas.  I lived in England 1980-1981 and used it as my home base/vacation location 1981-1982.  I lived up in Leeds – and while there was still a White plurality, I was amazed by all the Pakis and Malaysians.   A couple of flatmates were from different areas of London – saw plenty of Caribbean darkies in the city.  The only places I recall as entirely White were smaller, far northern villages.  Sort of like what exists in small pockets in America today – and don’t kid yourself, they’re all being targeted there just as they are here.

            I am also half-English. Last time I went to Liverpool it didn’t seem to be as vibrant as, say Birmingham or Manchester. But Liverpudlians are funny and based…they will call any brown stranger “Mohammed” in that awful accent of theirs, and “bloody Paki” is a common term, even in public. They also don’t like how the vibrants have taken over the parks. They will come in on Sunday mornings, trash the place, and leave in the afternoon.

                    I’m an American-based Liverpool supporter and the message board I frequent is home to the types of people who would be booted from The Guardian or Daily Kos boards due to being too far-left.  Naturally, they subscribe to the religion of “anti-racism…unless it’s anti-white”.

                The Anglo-American club is an interesting one, particularly those of us that had contact with the earlier, hardscrabble veterans of The Blitz.  My mom was born in 1939, had her house demolished by a V-2, and spent much of toddler-hood in Wales.  My grandmother lived from 1910-2013 … now that was a lady with a sweeping view of 20th century history; she was an atheist/socialist who abhorred England uniting with “the continent” under the EU banner.The greater lesson is to view the consequences of Empire.  England was ruined by the very peoples they tried to civilize, particularly India and Pakistan.  France went with north Africa and Vietnam … yeah, that worked well.  We assumed the Empire mantle from England and doubled-down in the Middle East, Vietnam, Somalia, and Afghanistan.  Hell, maybe France got the better deal.The quest for Empire chews up great nations and spits out the bones.

                        Exactly.   Not to go CivNat with this but imagine an America that heeded Washington’s farewell address.  At some point I expect there will be a Great Fracture, and at that point we need to carry this lesson-learned forward:  the primary national interest is to preserve/protect a homogeneous people and culture.  If/when enemies arise, destroy them and leave only wreckage in the wake … nation-building is for suckers.

                    The Colonial outposts actually had few Europeans, so modern colonialism wasn’t an invasion.(400 years ago, Europe was crowded, and the lands were empty.  Migration, a dumping of the ‘trash’, not predatory invasion.)
We were piggybacked.“Encouraged’  to go Empire.But, it’s been that way for a long, long time in our strange symbiosis.
What we did before was exploration.This, today, is war.

I recall, prior to my first overseas posting, learning that Fiji was more than half dot-Indian.  That was an eye opener.  Then all the Indians in Jamaica.  Wherever you go, there they are – and they behave the same damn way.

            It’s one thing for the government to arrest white meanies and tolerate muslim rape gangs. What is really distressing is that (as far as I know) there haven’t been any vigilante groups formed to go after the perpetrators and enablers of those muslim rape gangs.
Seriously, how completely impotent and cucked does one need to be to allow someone to live unharmed, after they raped their daughters? Are there no actual men living in England anymore?

                That’s exactly the point of hunting down, arresting and making an example of the football supporter, for the minor “crime” of insufficient negrolaty. That’s sending a message that they’ll really bring the hammer down on anyone who actually hurts the blacks or Muslims.Individuals get crushed like bugs. Even attempting to organize a neighborhood watch to keep your white girls safe would be met with the full force of the police state.Most people are not prepared to be martyrs. Life under Mustache Guy or  Koba’s boot proved that.

                        It’s not that people are comfortable, I think. It’s that people don’t have any leaders to coalesce around. Lone wolves get put down. Trump talks a good game but hasn’t actually done anything to create a local organization for us to join- Cuck Republican Inc hates his and our guts just as much as the Democrats.We suffer from a lack of leaders to give us strength in numbers. Until we get real leadership, whites will keep their heads down and muddle through.Until influential members of the elite begin to support a pro-white party, it will never be anything but a fringe movement. Peasant rebellions never succeed, ground up popular politics never have staying power because the key is getting at least some of the elite class on our side.

                            Yes!!!!!  Leaders; a re-invigorated culture to give purpose and pride, and perhaps stop them from killing themselves off with meth, oxy, obesity — something that provides hope.

That’s why churches alone won’t do, they are a support group, the woman’s function.
I see now the idea of a King above kings, the flagpole around which we can organize ourselves.*
We are primates, we need an male alpha- but we need a real life alpha as well.
The leader of the herd is the first one likely to get his head bitten off.  It’s a test of bravery and fitness.

You’re not supposed to get caught.  If you do –  you’re doing it wrong.
Wrap a towel around your head – and go in yelling Aloha Snackbar! – and it suddenly becomes a matter for the “community policing” squad.
New Jersey has just such a quandary on their hands right now – since the “Black Israelites” attacked a store full of long-beard Jews.

                Both the U.S. and Britain are de facto police states today. You are not allowed to openly organize if you are white or even covertly. Try it and you get crushed
Just look at the state’s reaction to those “it’s okay to be white” flyers.  Yet it’s okay for all other ethnic groups to promote their agenda even if it is breaking up the U.S.(Mecha, Atzlan)
For all intents the government has declared war on whites in both countries(and others as well). I’m serious the government and it’s organs want most whites dead and gone.

                Outdoors, an answer: “Single mums”
I think it was the Zman who said, “once women are in charge of government- (see Sweden or now Finland)- they will soon find themselves under the thumb of patriarchal invaders.”
I don’t want to oppress our girls, I like them free and with options.  But now I see why men needed their Inner Azzhole: we were supposed to direct it against worse men.

        Someone here recently observed how progressives can only progress: there is no conceivable world in which they would be conservative, i.e, happy with the way things are. There’s no end point. The eschaton cannot be immanentized.Case in point: that lezzy kickball player who got Sports Illustrated’s top award.An opportunity for a pause and a moment of gratitude, to acknowledge the struggle and appreciate the rewards?Hardly. She used the opportunity to berate the magazine staff for their failings.These are people Republicans think can be compromised with. As they run faster and farther to the left, what passes for our right hurries along about two steps behind yelling, “Wait up! We’ve met you more than halfway. You were right. We have a position paper supporting what you said yesterday. We have found common ground.”I got a chance to test-drive one of the left’s hobby horses last night. The setup is boring but necessary to the story, which will circle back to my point.I was in a warehouse hardware store and bought some stuff which included a long wooden dowel. It was positioned lengthwise, angled down in the cart in such a way as not to fall through the interstices.After it was scanned, I put it back into the cart but not quite the same way and it fell through. I picked it up. The female cashier laughed and said, “You men. Always the hard way.” She came from behind the counter to take it out of my hand and lay it across the cart.This was a 48” dowel, and now it was my property. I’ll cop to no less OCD than any other high-achieving white guy. It didn’t look right to me sticking out from both sides, so I put it back the way I had it the first time.She laughed again and said, “I’m telling you, it’ll fall out. Men and their minds.”I said, conversationally, that I thought the customer was always right. She laughed again and looked at the woman who was behind me in the line and said, “These men.”So I got my Very Serious Look – like when giving a patient the bad news – and said, “Are you ridiculing me on the basis of what you assume is my gender?”Poor thing backed and filled, hemmed and hawed, did everything but the full head-banging-on-the-floor kowtow.My reaction was two-part: a feeling of triumph, of having won the competition, and at the same time the realization that had she said, “Oh, grow up,” or the equivalent, I would have been embarrassed for being a jerk, laughed and thanked her for her help and advice.The Sports Illustrated staff should have laughed that bitch off the podium and rescinded the award. But I’ll bet they all went home vowing to do better.

            Doc;Guerrilla Theater deployed against Momshaming.  I love it.  Probably best deployed near a Prog Hive.  The cognitive dissonance would be awesome.  Might even bring some bystander over.Serious general point: A lot more pushback is needed when we Wyte males are confronted by SJW’s (Social Justice Warriors) disrespect (or plain old disrespect like you were), correlation of forces taken into account.  Best to use humor &amp; ridicule in reverse.  Don’t get mad, get even and all that.To expand on my idea re your situation:– Bad reaction: Get red-faced, shut up and sulk – bitch wins another one.– OK (semi-lame) reaction: “You’re not my mom so stop acting that way.”– OK reaction: “Women always gotta have the last word, eh.”– OK (better) reaction: “Madam, now that I own this dowel rod, I’ll man-carry it however I like.  But thanks anyway for your very helpful instruction.”– Your reaction: Epic PC Judo_!But I have to confess that I mostly come up with a good rejoinder about 15 min. after the encounter is over.  So I’m definitely not saying I’d have done better under the circumstances.  Probably would have gone with the ‘last word’ one.

                Doc, make her sweat it. Those hardware store chains ask for survey responses, specifically citing the clerk who checked you out.  It’s printed on that foot-long receipt and the clerks like to helpfully circle the website and explain how it works.  They obviously get widget points for a big number of responses.  There was an opportunity to take great interest in going on-line at home and responding to the survey about your gender-assuming gender-shaming check out clerk.  Tell her that’s what you are going to do.  Mess with them every chance you get.

When women learn how men talk to other men, they love it.  We have got to start teasing, teaching, and talking to each other again.
Women are as clueless, nerdy, and uncertain as we are, but they really aren’t the enemy.  Those girls liked you, they were throwing girly-rocks to get you to play with them.
(Plus, they hate this PC crap as much as you do, but they’re waiting for someone to show them how to diffuse it. They’re stuck.)

        The UK is a joke, they arrest people for being mean on twitter while “Asian Men” have rape gangs that target young white girls and the police are too afraid to be called racist to go after these “people.”
Not to mention, the Swedes and the Finns now both completely run by commie wahmans.

            The British are subjects, not citizens. They are offended by American notions of citizenship and personal rights and freedoms, which they think leads to vigilante chaos and mayhem. There is some merit to the idea as anyone who has seen a race riot or chimp out – can attest. However, the British flip side to that is distinctly much worse.

                    I have a friend who lives over there and says that on the council flats and ghetto estates, they’ve graduated from stabbing each other with knives to slicing each other with swords. I remember awhile back some Diversity decapitated a soldier in the street, and the English government came up with the solution that English people should not wear anything with the Union Jack on it, lest they offend the diversity and also get decapitated. Crack solution, that! Country’s devolved into a Python sketch from hell.

                John Smith, incorrect. The concept of “subject” was abolished in 1993. We are citizens. But, even if that was not true (and I assure you that it is) what difference would it make? Yes, Britain is undergoing a hum-drum ethnocide but is that not true of the entire West, including the USA? Is France any less cucked and f*cked by virtue of it being a republic?

                        But jackboots won’t be kicking down your doors, or ours. That’s not the way this works. You will just be gradually but relentlessly stripped of everything that makes a decent life possible. It’s a process, not an event.

Seriously? They’ve been rioting for a year now, with millions of people in the streets, dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded.
The five most cucked countries in the world are Canada, Sweden, Britain, Germany and the US, with Australia coming strong.

NYC police setting up a special unit to investigate people like us. Virginia pushing to make whites getting together illegal and putting in the first pieces to ban guns. It’s a close race to end whites.

                            The Virginia thing is interesting though………  a number of counties have basically told Richmond to go screw itself.  From what I read the Sheriff in at least one county deputized everybody who wanted to keep their “assault weapon” – as an FU to the state government.  Supposedly there are actual militias being formed up in other counties – and not by the usual half-cocked militia types either ,  but rather by level headed business types.As I saw somebody point out:  Virginia played a prominent role in the Revolution, and again played a leading role in the Civil War.The crux of the current issue on the surface is the right to self defense – and which weaponry the government is going to let  you own to do that – but following a close second is the demographic shift that allowed the Democrats to gain seats and enact their draconian legislation.  So while the demographic issue is something people still won’t openly talk about – since that and the gun issue are so closely related at this point – it probably doesn’t matter as a practical thing.Somewhere out there is a line that the lefties seem to be working overtime to look for – past which they’re not going to be able to push people over.  I think Virginia bears watching closely to see how the whole thing plays out.CT enacted “assault weapons” laws,  and from what I’ve read the compliance rate has been very low.  NY did the same – and again – low compliance.  In neither of these cases have I ever seen there been much discussion over the fact that nobody is complying.  Here in MA the AG banned AR-15s, and even talked about making it retroactive.  Yet nothing has happened.   Seems like in most cases up until now increased anti-gun legislation on the part of the commies has just created a Sitzkrieg type war where everybody sits around to see who wants to make the first move.Doesn’t seem like that is what is happening in VA.  The proggie idiots in the government (financed by Bloomberg) – decided to double down on their anti-gun laws ,  and VA gun owning residents appear to be taking positive action to say FU back to the state government.That’s a new wrinkle in the fabric.

                            The *white men are about to grow vaginas.Non-whites are becoming more deadly, dangerous and radical. Whites seem to have simply disappeared from large swaths of the country.Boomers don’t care. Apparently if you just smile and are “nice” to people they will be “nice” back. 😉A haunting sight I saw was in Mississauga. At a busy McDonalds, about 1/4 of the customers were happy, retired, laughing white Boomers. The rest of the restaurant was filled with younger, scowling, smelly, angry 3rd worlders, Chinamen, and God knows what else. The Boomers did not appear to notice, nor care, that they were utterly outnumbered by foreign invaders who hated them.

                                        Daddy issues. Rock n roll sissies ( as opposed to Country music fans) and children who whine about boomers often have daddy issues.Boomers were correctly labeled the “Destructive Generation” by Horowitz and Collier- but one day young fools will wake up and realize that the dead boomers were most of the gringos left in the US, and that now they cant get a fair jury trial to protect them from reverse Jim Crow police and DAs or even elect a mayor whose (merely) a cuck and a weakling because he/she/xer is not anti-white enough, ala California. Gun rights? Gone. Self defense? Depends on your race. Free speech? Please! If you speak against Israel, President Mbangu, or anything “racist” (Affirmative action/open borders) you will be jailed. The children will write a (rock) song about how right they were to hate boomers- instead of rallying them to a new, white equality, civil rights revolution. Im a young boomer. So maybe I’ll get to dry the tears of a few fully grown children crying about daddy. In the meantime the adult Xers and  millenials will be left trying to figure out how to launch that new civil rights project with a whole lot fewer whites and a whole lot more anti-white dindus. They wont have time to hate boomers. And thats the point. Neither do we.

                                            It’s a bizarre obsession. In a time when masses of millennials persecute those who say males and females are different, many still have a fetish for bangin’ on boomers……even to the point of borrowing the “POC left’s” pseudo-shaming tactic of “Look how fragile you are” and “I have to suffer so much, ‘cos I have to watch every word I say when I’m around you,” heh.But that’s the way it is, and I reckon it’s our payback for “Don’t trust anyone over 30.”Millions of us were exposed to vibrancy and bare the scars to prove it, so like it or not, we’re part of the same “get me the the hell out of this crazy, ‘woke’ — (we used to call it PC) — “culture and back to normalcy” thing  we’re all doing together.

                        Felix is right.  The Meds and Visegrads have a pretty strong tradition of populist political violence, general strikes, etc.. and I include France with the Meds in that respect.NW Euros are the soft underbelly for diversity.  Kevin MacDonald and Helmuth Nyborg talked about this at length in Oslo last month     Lower populations, high agreeableness and trust, lower anxiety and less experience with mass migration make NW Europe a wonderful place but also render it uniquely fragile.Left unchecked, mass migration will eventually do to NW European populations what Old World  diseases did to New World aboriginals.  It’s a cultural pathogen Hajnal-liners have never evolved a defense for.

                            I’m a NW Euro. Why do I have it, and obviously others do as well. But clearly the vast majority don’t.
Are we NW Euros just a rarer genetic mutation of other NW Euros? Also, how do Germans fit into this picture.

                                UFO – Germany was culturally terraformed by the wars of the 20th century and their years of occupation and subjugation.  Felix is right in placing them on the cuck leader-board.  NW Euros have higher genetic propensity for agreeableness, social conformity and empathy.  Their culture plays to these things, strengths in their evolutionary context but vulnerabilities when facing new alien environmental pressures they haven’t faced historically.The (((multicultural project))) hits them hardest because of this.  Most Semite ethnicities are bred and raised for multi-ethnic urbanity.  White Meds have thousands more years of exposure to urbanity and ethnic conflict.  Visegrads have lived in the Asian-Euro invasion corridor for millennia.The degree of foreign-ness that you are historically exposed to matters in this.  The Germans and Scandis fought each other constantly but a Swede living under a Danish hegemony suffers less cultural and evolutionary stress and pressure than a Greek does under an Ottoman.

                        Regardless—Subject or Citizen—the ceding of power over oneself to a government or sovereign has always been understood as a reciprocal arrangement in that there were responsibilities of the governed to the government and the government, whether in the form of a King or Parliament, to the governed.
Never before to my understanding has a system developed in which the society, culture—even the people themselves—could be eliminated at the whim of the government.  Such a system is not only tyrannical, it’s farcical.

                    I stand corrected, Your Highness. The Britons may not be subjects to the letter of the law, but in application – they are accepting and embracing the pozz. Even those cheese eating surrender monkeys in Fwance are starting to rebel… I am watching the Yellow Vest crowd and I am pleased by the efforts the media slobs are going to in order avoid noticing them. In America, Virginians just told their gun grabbing leaders that they’d be keeping their guns, thank you very much – and if the leadership wanted to get stupid about it, the dirt people would use them. Crimethink websites like this one are exploding in popularity. I am not seeing that in Briton… am I mistaken in that as well?

                            All kings are ‘usurpers’. You conquer by hook or by crook, you win. You could say the rightful Kings of England are the House of Godwin, or going back further to Æthelstan (or even Alfred the Great).

            You seem to be one of those people under the delusion that the “First Amendment” somehow makes the US less cucked. I can tell you with 100% certainty that is not the case. Just a few days ago I posted an article about a woman being arrested for saying mean words to minorities. Arrested for speaking. The kid the Z mentioned above was arrested and thrown out of college for saying ‘its ok to be white’. People are arrested weekly for similar crimes in the US. How is it different here?I got into a verbal confrontation, verbal, not physical with a ‘Person of Color’ and I was an “early adopter” of this draconian police state enforcement. They brought the walls of jericho down on me, you would think I was Al Capone given the amount of heavily armed SWAT and police that showed up for one of those fun little no-knock raids at 3am at my residence. Battering ram, stun grenades, full auto M4 rifles, the whole deal.Again, my crime was verbal in nature. The response was as physical as it could possibly be and the extended jail time they wanted to slap on me was as real as it gets. Remember, only words were exchanged at that point. That was enough for any wily and crafty POC that knows how the system works now to run to the cops and claim rayciss! And the liberal whites will respond by sending literal death squads to your house. Armed white male vs. ‘helpless innocent’ minority is not a narrative you want to find yourself in. Never mind that the guy had been harassing me for weeks prior and there was a mountain of evidence.My lawyer who is a bit of a realist straight up said “white guy with firearms making threats vs. minority in the DC area, cut the plea deal or face some prison time”.  This is the “un-cucked” America you appear to be talking about here, right? I am of course still incredibly bitter about now being a convict and having a record for my ‘crimes’ that make me nearly unemployable but on the other side of it, it has hardened my resolve that I need to LEAVE. Like, now. I’m actively taking steps to get not only away from DC but out of the States. I will never feel safe here again when I realize how easily a single Victim Class with a bone to pick and the ability to game the system can destroy you entirely.Your move whitey.

            Your tone demonstrates exactly what is wrong with white. Sort of whiny, appealing to an authority that doesn’t exist. “Can’t SOMEBODY stop these people?”Well, that somebody is you. Obviously the government is indifferent or supports it. Most Brits are fat and obsessed with sportsball. In Pakistan, for every transgression against your own tribe, a member of the other tribe is killed. Doesn’t matter if they’re the perp.Point is, the Pakis only understand force and Brits need to set up vigilante gangs or neighborhood watches – even solo if need be. Government won’t save you I’m afraid so stop pretending like it will.

            That is a self-serving lie and you should not repeat it.They are NOT afraid of being called racist.  They are afraid of Muslim riots and violence.  They are as afraid of Muslims rioting as they are not afraid of white people rioting.Tommy Robinson told an anecdote in his book about a Muslim who bashed a cop in the head with a brick.  They arrested the Muzzie and took him down to the station.  Shortly thereafter a bunch of Muzzie “leaders” went to the station and demanded the charges be dropped and he be released or there would be rioting now and block voting later.  Needless to say, the threat of rioting today and block voting later was enough of a threat to throw the cop who got hit in the head with a brick under the bus.  Muzzie released without incident.Until the British elite FEARS the white natives more than Muslims, this will not only never end, but get worse.

            It’s abnormal for a society to have the resources to police something like this.  It’s too much walking around money for big government, over too long a period of time.  It’s one thing to want to police something, it’s another to have the resources to do it.

                Just to restate your point, I read a bit about the resources dedicated to the DC Sniper investigation and had the the thought that if there was even one more black-muzzie-murder crew working a different municipality the Federal government’s efforts would have started to break down; if there were two more the Feds wouldn’t have been able to help.Same with the “It’s OK to be white flyers”.  One university in Oklahoma can command all the resources of the state to be brought down on this, but not two, and certainly not all of them.(If I had to guess, universities ignoring “It’s OK to be white” flyers is much more common than we’d be given to think, not every institution is run by lunatics, yet.)

            To clarify, the cops aren’t afraid, it’s worse.
Several anonymous letters from British cops say it goes down line this. The have a suspect in these crimes, it’s determined that they are part of a certain community, at which point they are mandated to kick it over to a Community Relations Unit, staffed by members of “the community” who then proceed to ignore the problems of their confreres.
Many policeman are livid about this state of affairs and aren’t being given a choice. It’s not even fear of being called a racist, it’s specialized units basically aiding and abetting.

        One guess as to why the FBI was interrogating the “OK to be white” student.  Look for them soon to find an inconsistency in the 302 report (i.e. whatever the FBI agents think they remembered him saying).  Boom, lying to the FBI, and your life is over.  Never talk to the FBI without a lawyer and recording device, even if you are not a subject of interest.

            This goes for all agents of the state. Never talk to them without recording it. Be polite, but resolute. We all wish it were otherwise, but reality is what it is. We can no longer trust any agent of the state.
Frankly, I recommend corporate employees invest in recording devices they can surreptitiously use to record interactions with female co-workers and supervisors. It may not save your job, but it will give you something to use in court.

Don’t speak to them at all, even if you’re recording it.  Your recording will be “inadmissible” in court so you’re still f*cked.  You sit there silently and let your lawyer answer all the questions.  When they ask you a question directly, you simply look over at your lawyer while keeping your mouth firmly closed.
After about two hours of this, they will get frustrated and give up.

                    I’ve watched that video a half dozen times in the last few years.  It’s priceless advice.  Anyone who’s spent time watching LEO auditing videos will soon be disabused of the idea that they’ll take our side when the SHTF.  Look at the way law enforcement have been militarized in the past three decades.  They truly see themselves as a branch of the military tasked with patrolling the homeland.  Guess who they view as enemy combatants?

I -really- wish someone would have showed me this when they come a-knockin’ w/ the goon squad at 3 am. I said too much and as they literally tell you “anything you say CAN and WILL be used AGAINST you” they literally read it to you that they will twist anything you say, and people still talk.I didn’t say much because I am from that world and know the game, but anything more than utter silence w/o the presence of a lawyer is too much. In fact, my own attorney had a card just like that. He was like ‘here is my card’. On the FRONT of the card it said, “STOP TALKING” printed just like that, his contact info was on the back, I knew I made the right pick. 😉

                Different locales have different laws re: recording someone w/o their knowledge.   That’s why sometimes you get that “your call may be recorded” disclaimer before you’re connected to your number.

                    Multiple circuit courts in the U.S. have ruled that you have a right to record public officials in the course of their duties.  If you’re referring to recording at work, that’s another ball of wax.  No one has an expectation of privacy while in public, but at your place of work make sure you’re on the right side of the law, lest the HR wine moms and cat ladies sink their claws into you.

                I second your advice wrt speaking with law enforcement agents.  It is never for your benefit.  Regarding surreptitious recording, you need to be careful wrt your state’s privacy laws.  Some states, like CA, are two-party states where both parties must consent to the recordation.  Recording without that consent may expose you to criminal and civil liability and impair the admissibility of the recording as evidence.

                    CA has an interesting twist on admissibility in that you can use surreptitious recordings as impeachment evidence to prove a witness is lying.  You might still be subject to liability for invasion of privacy, etc… and I’m pretty sure you’re still subject to misdemeanor prosecution for making the recording regardless.
Always check your local laws and get some professional advice before you surreptitiously record someone.

        I saw that story on ESPN.com (I go there because I still have a passing interest in how my alma mater’s basketball team does and some baseball) and I kept waiting for the punch line.A man was arrested for a racist gesture. A gesture. Not a murder. A rape or any other crime. Prostituting teenage white girls by Pakis is ignored, but hey, if you tweet something offensive to the present order, to the hoosegow you go. It really is a clown world.I agree with Z. We are in a suicide cult. Look at the opioid crisis, the suicide crisis among our vets who were sent to fight in meaningless wars that needlessly sacrificed blood and treasure for pointless aims.We are targeted for extinction by our ruling class (who thinks replacing us with a dumber cohort will give them more control) and anyone who doesn’t see it is delusional. We are the golden goose and once we’re gone, the others will deviate back to the mean, which means barbarism.

            “sent to fight in meaningless wars that needlessly sacrificed blood and treasure for pointless aims.”You misunderstand the entire venture.  From the point of view of the perps and instigators, these wars were a tremendous success.  Some of the many goals achieved:1.  Plenty of White goyim killed and maimed, their families separated, their normal careers disrupted or destroyed, thus healthy goy family formation stunted, the whole goy reproduction cycle diminished.  A mitzvah.2.  Many additional goy children who had loving fathers will instead now grow up fatherless, or with deeply injured or psychologically damaged fathers, further disrupting the goy life cycle.  A mitzvah.3.  American troops busy playing whack-a-mole on the other side of the planet, busy anywhere else on earth except the one place they should actually be: on the Mexican border defending goy territory against the infinity invasion of monkeymen who will take goy jobs, ruin goy neighborhoods, rape foul White shiksas, ruin goy schools, destroy goy social fabric, consume goy social capital, enstupidate goy culture, wreck goy racial cohesion, and be a never-ending albatross of Third World neediness, consuming all goy seed corn.  A mitzvah.4.  Sow chaos and mass destruction in all the enemies of Israel, destroying otherwise viable states and causing an infinity refugee influx of African monkeymen and Arab rape-apes into Europe, further destroying European bloodlines and ensuring the maximum number of shiksas get raped, further destroying White fertility. Jews get all the benefits, don’t spend a dime, and not a single Israeli soldier is put in harm’s way.  A mitzvah.5.  All of this is financed by trillions of dollars of (((debt))), and we all know where the fruits of (((usury))) will end up.  They actually pay us to destroy themselves, at our command.  Now we’re telling them to eat bugs, chop off their children’s dicks, and live in pods, and they’re DOING it.  Is there a single hoop these degraded chumps WON’T jump through on command?All in all, a smashing success!

            The ruling class has nothing to worry about. It seems whites love sports more than they hate being marked for death.We talk a lot here about tipping points, waking up, taking action, of being literally hungry enough to grab a pitchfork. Yet stadiums and arenas are brimming with whites idolizing people that despise them. Every bar and restaurant has TVs pumping blackity black sports on a loop.Ask a mate ‘who won the game?’ and you will enter a lengthy conversation. Ask a mate ‘can you believe this coup on president Trump has been going on in plain view for three years?’ and you will get a sideways glance and some mumbling about russians.Let them eat bread and circuses I guess.

        You’ll appreciate this nice note to a bunch of unruly Africansat Oxford,Lost the cite, If I find it, I’ll post it.: Dear Scrotty Students,Cecil Rhodes’s generous bequest has contributed greatly to the comfort and well being of many generations of Oxford students – a good many of them, dare we say it, better, brighter and more deserving than you.This does not necessarily mean we approve of everything Rhodes did in his lifetime – but then we don’t have to. Cecil Rhodes died over a century ago. Autres temps, autres moeurs. If you don’t understand what this means – and it would not remotely surprise us if that were the case – then we really think you should ask yourself the question: “Why am I at Oxford?”Oxford, let us remind you, is the world’s second oldest extant university. Scholars have been studying here since at least the 11th century. We’ve played a major part in the invention of Western civilisation, from the 12th century intellectual renaissance through the Enlightenment and beyond. Our alumni include William of Ockham, Roger Bacon, William Tyndale, John Donne, Sir Walter Raleigh, Erasmus, Sir Christopher Wren, William Penn, Samuel Johnson, Robert Hooke, William Morris, Oscar Wilde, Emily Davison, Cardinal Newman. We’re a big deal. And most of the people privileged to come and study here are conscious of what a big deal we are. Oxford is their alma mater – their dear mother – and they respect and revere her accordingly.And what were your ancestors doing in that period? Living in mud huts, mainly. Sure we’ll concede you the short lived Southern African civilisation of Great Zimbabwe. But let’s be brutally honest here. The contribution of the Bantu tribes to modern civilisation has been as near as damn it to zilch.You’ll probably say that’s “racist”. But it’s what we here at Oxford prefer to call “true.” Perhaps the rules are different at other universities. In fact, we know things are different at other universities. We’ve watched with horror at what has been happening across the pond from the University of Missouri to the University of Virginia and even to revered institutions like Harvard and Yale: the “safe spaces”; the‪ #‎blacklivesmatter; the creeping cultural relativism; the stifling political correctness; what Allan Bloom rightly called “the closing of the American mind”. At Oxford however, we will always prefer facts and free, open debate to petty grievance-mongering, identity politics and empty sloganeering. The day we cease to do so is the day we lose the right to call ourselves the world’s greatest university.Of course, you are perfectly within your rights to squander your time at Oxford on silly, vexatious, single-issue political campaigns. (Though it does make us wonder how stringent the vetting procedure is these days for Rhodes scholarships and even more so, for Mandela Rhodes scholarships) We are well used to seeing undergraduates – or, in your case – postgraduates, making idiots of themselves. Just don’t expect us to indulge your idiocy, let alone genuflect before it. You may be black – “BME” as the grisly modern terminology has it – but we are colour blind. We have been educating gifted undergraduates from our former colonies, our Empire, our Commonwealth and beyond for many generations. We do not discriminate over sex, race, colour or creed. We do, however, discriminate according to intellect.That means, inter alia, that when our undergrads or postgrads come up with fatuous ideas, we don’t pat them on the back, give them a red rosette and say: “Ooh, you’re black and you come from South Africa. What a clever chap you are!” No. We prefer to see the quality of those ideas tested in the crucible of public debate. That’s another key part of the Oxford intellectual tradition you see: you can argue any damn thing you like but you need to be able to justify it with facts and logic – otherwise your idea is worthless.This ludicrous notion you have that a bronze statue of Cecil Rhodes should be removed from Oriel College, because it’s symbolic of “institutional racism” and “white slavery”. Well even if it is – which we dispute – so bloody what? Any undergraduate so feeble-minded that they can’t pass a bronze statue without having their “safe space” violated really does not deserve to be here. And besides, if we were to remove Rhodes’s statue on the premise that his life wasn’t blemish-free, where would we stop? As one of our alumni Dan Hannan has pointed out, Oriel’s other benefactors include two kings so awful – Edward II and Charles I – that their subjects had them killed. The college opposite – Christ Church – was built by a murderous, thieving bully who bumped off two of his wives. Thomas Jefferson kept slaves: does that invalidate the US Constitution? Winston Churchill had unenlightened views about Muslims and India: was he then the wrong man to lead Britain in the war?”Actually, we’ll go further than that. Your Rhodes Must Fall campaign is not merely fatuous but ugly, vandalistic and dangerous. We agree with Oxford historian RW Johnson that what you are trying to do here is no different from what ISIS and the Al-Qaeda have been doing to artefacts in places like Mali and Syria. You are murdering history.And who are you, anyway, to be lecturing Oxford University on how it should order its affairs? Your ‪#‎rhodesmustfall campaign, we understand, originates in South Africa and was initiated by a black activist who told one of his lecturers “whites have to be killed”. One of you – Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh – is the privileged son of a rich politician and a member of a party whose slogan is “Kill the Boer; Kill the Farmer”; another of you, Ntokozo Qwabe, who is only in Oxford as a beneficiary of a Rhodes scholarship, has boasted about the need for “socially conscious black students” to “dominate white universities, and do so ruthlessly and decisively!Great. That’s just what Oxford University needs. Some cultural enrichment from the land of Winnie Mandela, burning tyre necklaces, an AIDS epidemic almost entirely the result of government indifference and ignorance, one of the world’s highest per capita murder rates, institutionalised corruption, tribal politics, anti-white racism and a collapsing economy. Please name which of the above items you think will enhance the lives of the 22,000 students studying here at Oxford.And then please explain what it is that makes your attention grabbing campaign to remove a listed statue from an Oxford college more urgent, more deserving than the desire of probably at least 20,000 of those 22,000 students to enjoy their time here unencumbered by the irritation of spoilt, ungrateful little tossers on scholarships they clearly don’t merit using racial politics and cheap guilt-tripping to ruin the life and fabric of our beloved university.Understand us and understand this clearly: you have everything to learn from us; we have nothing to learn from you.Yours,etc..

            It was probably lost on the intended audience but Jefferson didn’t write the Constitution.  I realize that’s nitpicking but when you premise your piece on your elevated knowledge base, you probably should get correct the author of one of the more influential pieces of writing that humans have conjoured.

                I think the point is that because some of the founders owned slaves, that in fact invalidates the entire founding of this country. And since it has been firmly established by the Supreme Court of Feels that this country was actually founded by Abe Lincoln (peace be upon him), who’s only purpose in life was to free the slaves, then it logically follows that this country was founded to be given to blacks. QED.
So there.

        There is no saving Metropolis.  Let it burn.It is a fane to the demon of scale, a hell-pit of dysgenic sexuality, pollution, crime, congestion, corruption, stress and the urbanite’s uniquely mad bipolarity of alienation and over-socialization.The biology, culture and values of Our Guys and those of bugmen are already dividing along very similar lines to those dividing urbanites and country folk.The Wokie is a creature of the polis.  Let him fester there among his fellow spiteful mutants.Our future is in the anti-polis of small towns making smart use of technology without becoming its thralls.I want our descendants to see the bugmen of the coastal favelas as the Vikings looked on the coastal sophisticates of their day.  The Vikings and Germanics in general conquered the post-Roman world by harvesting the best of what civilization had to offer while cleansing the decadence and degeneracy with fire.

        In NYC, the police’s intelligence department has created a unit known as “Racially and Ethnically Motivated Extremism,” or “R.E.M.E,” that will be primarily dedicated to investigating terror threats from far-right and neo-Nazi organizations. Virginia is looking to label any white who doesn’t grovel as a potential terrorist and/or mentally ill and thus not allowed to own a gun.

            We need to start moving into certain areas of the country sooner rather than later. Conservatives think they can beat back Virginia’s legislature through creating sanctuary counties and enlisting the sympathies of local sheriffs and county officials. They lack an appreciation for the level of centralized, real power now in the hands of federal officials who are writing these laws and handing them off to staff aides to elected reps in the state, and they’ll be picked off one by one over the next year in kangaroo courts and being dragged through the media, having their jobs threatened, and worse.The impeachment circus is a massive, massive distraction, and I expect — literally expect — that once the Senate kicks the ball away, the House will do it *again* in the spring. DC and the media do nothing but provide reality TV programming for whatever percentage of the public wants to turn their eyes away from the decay and dissolution in front of them. I have no idea what this percentage is, but it’s likely considerable. These people will be lost to time soon, and there’s nothing to be done with them. For those not paying attention (again, likely considerable) my diagnosis is even worse — they seem not to be able to accurately discern immediate threats to their well-being. Their lot will be even worse. We must leave all of them behind and get far, far away from them.I also have a hard time believing that votes will be counted honestly next November. This is also a delusion that plagues “conservatives” — that despite the corruption and outright authoritarianism on display at all levels of government, law, media, education, and culture, there is a magical tribe of honest citizens who’ll tally up the votes, and — by hook or crook — transmit those numbers to even-more dutiful officials at the federal level for reporting by the media on election night. Trump may very well win (it seems to be working in their favor to have him as a pinata), but it won’t be the result of millions of citizens using their hard-won right to vote to slap back at the international elites now running our expired Republic. It’ll be because that’s what they want for us.It’s quite dire, and for those who can, we really ought to be thinking in the short-term now, as in 2-3 years.

                Spot-on.  As to sanctuary counties, making a strong 2A statement is a good start, but it’s only as effective as a citizenry willing to employ those arms.

                The suburbs of the Imperial Capital are not the best place for loud-and-proud dissident communities.  I understand the ties to the land that many of these people feel but VA is probably the worst state in which to take a stand.  Dissent on the outskirts of D.C. is more provocative and these dissenters are more exposed and vulnerable than probably anywhere else in America.
I wish we already had communities more remote from the Hive where these brave folks could relocate.  I’d rather add them to our diaspora than lose them in a futile stand at Mordor’s gates.

                        Proximity to the Imperial Capital still an issue, particularly being under a state government that’s wholly converged by DC. I know the area, from OH myself before I moved to CA and spent time there and WVa.  A lot of our guys are there and I wish we had someplace they could just pack up and move to.  The last time VA patriots took on Washington the proximity of Richmond to Mordor was a constant concern.  Nowadays the problem is more that the state will act as a facilitator for DC to crush you rather than an impediment.  No state government is going to fight DC for us, but some won’t do their dirty work for them without prodding.  VA’s on the far bad end of that spectrum.

They have income to pump into the local economy and they don’t need to worry about finding a job. I actually plan on doing this myself when I retire in 10 years or so. I figure that by then there will be areas like this forming. I’ll just move in and buy local-that will be my contribution…

        The hell of it is, is it’s mostly white people (and a goodly margin of those… are whites women). I think we just need to stretch some necks.
Thankfully Americans are armed and cling to their guns and bibles. Looks like they’ll need both, and sooner rather than later.

            John Smith, if not the state of Virginia, then the re-election of Donald Trump might get this started while we still have the upper hand, and as horrific as it would be, sooner is more advantageous than later.  Their hatred, insanity, and lust for complete power will work to their defeat if the future is now.

                One way or another, I expect Nov. 3, 2020 to be a major turning point for the US.
Scenario #1: Trump gets re-elected. The prog-left/antifa will absolutely not accept this result. Will take to the streets. The deplorables and/or Trump decide enough is finally enough. National Guard deployed? Who knows.
Scenario #2: Trump defeated. Most likely, voter fraud will be obvious and widespread. Prog-left take to streets in celebration and defiance with predictable results. Reaction? See scenario #1.
One of these things will happen. My money is on #1.

Also, Judicial Watch has as well. But cheats are going to cheat without compunction, or fear of retribution.  And Philly Black Panthers might just try blocking whites from voting.

        I read that the two people stabbed on the Bridge recently by a muslim were students studying how to successfully reintegrate previous offenders into society. The muslim who stabbed them was a previous offender who held extremist views, and unfortunately for both of them, did not attend the same conference they did (otherwise the conference would have naturally cured him and the stabbing never would have happened). God is trying to tell us something with this kind of screaming level of irony. The powder keg in Germany now (bigger than the Chemnitz stabbing) is that an off-duty fireman was beaten to death (on camera) at a Christmas market by seven diversities. We shall see how tight the tether is on the bear being bated.

        Well, I’m old line Anglo/Scots-Irish.  We’re good at grudges and feuds.  If those become the rules of the game so be it.  We’re the people that put “blood” in  “blood feud”.  But one observation I’ve made before.  This is more evidence that you can excite these people into a whirlwind over the smallest things.  We had an ID Europa sticker at a local college–mass hysteria.  Some teenager drew a swastika on a locker (not even a Jewish kids) at the local middle school.  The whole town locked up in a frenzy of hysteria for two weeks.  A watch was set every night looking for night riders burning crosses (I exaggerate, but not by much)  This is one of their Achilles’ heels.  You can wear them out.

            Sam;Yes to wearing them out as a strategy.  We need to do more of this.*As an example to emulate, Pres. Trump apparently figured this out at least 5 years ago.  He accurately ID’d Hillary’s strategic center of gravity as the MSM.  And he figured out a way to keep the MSM constantly running around in circles with their hair on fire by using Twitter, of all things.  Some ‘outrageous’ tweet every 3 days or so is all it takes.**Once you see that it’s largely Grand Master level trolling, you just can’t unsee it.  And the beauty of it is that the MSM corporate overlords really like the ad money that the constant outrage cycle brings in, so their minions are forced to cover all of the Trump tweets.  They can’t just stifle Trump’s inconvenient stories like they usually do for the run-of-the-mill GOPe (Republican side of the uni-party).  And, as a bonus they get to look like idiots to normies,***______________________________* Maybe fund lawsuits against the “It’s OK to be White.” persecutors sorta’ like those picking up speed against the ‘Campus Rape Epidemic’ secret tribunals.  Trial lawyers are starting to smell blood in the water.** I’d bet some Benjamins ($100 bills) that there are staffers in the Whitehouse whose sole job it is to tee up candidates for a pool of at-the-ready standby tweets: Whitehouse tweet writer is the new Whitehouse speech writer.  Probably not a good DC pick-up line, though.*** It’s a thing of beauty to behold_!  I *almost* feel sorry for them.  It must be really taxing to their hive-minds. Might even red-pill one or two.

        The Premier League is a joke. I can’t believe that the people of Manchester go along to sing and cheer for the team of their city. The players aren’t from Manchester. The manager isn’t. The owners aren’t from Manchester. They will all bail when times get tough and never give another thought to the dump. The only loyalty is from the fans who will become furious if anything is said about “their club”. How you could pay all that money and give up all those hours to cheer for people who have no connected identity to you and don’t care about you is something I can’t understand.

            Absent sports and entertainment, there isn’t much to say for the cultural representation of the black/brown mob. The average DeShawn or Mo doesn’t typically work in a high status profession, and many don’t conceal their loathing of First World wage slavery. Part of the reason they are so angry is because they wish they could “go back” but won’t surrender the living standards.

            We could shut down this if our people were simply willing to cut their pay-TV cords. There were no shortage of angry Boomers willing to rally to Trump’s alleged call to boycott the NFL over the flag protest. But absent continuous agitation by their leaders, they just sat back and grilled. And a year later, most are back to watching blacks that hate them.

            Walt is right about the clubs being abandoned by the non-British owners as soon as they lose interest, or money (Football clubs in the UK are heavily in debt and utterly beholden to television stations: fixtures are moved into unappealing time slots to cater for their demands) but there are also two other issues.First, many of the excessively overpaid players at the top (I am not sure how paying someone another twenty thousand quid a week improves their playing performance, but there we are) are either foreign or not of British (that is, white) heritage. Thus a number of the England youth teams–development squads intended to furnish players for the senior English international team–aren’t pale. So much so that at one youth-level international game I attended the England team would have been better described as watching “young Africa” including carrying names from the dark continent.The second issue is not only as Z-man points out the race of the paying spectators, but I note their age. My local professional football team draws decent size crowds for the level they play at, but when I look round at game time there are very few young people in the stadium. Most of the paying fans are old or approaching old age. In twenty years time many of them will be gone, and I suspect this particular club like many in their condition will be either playing part-time or amateur in a much lower league if the club is still going with their accumulated debts.Our ‘golden era’ of spectator sports even in a multi-cult UK depends still on white participation in the stands and on the terraces, and it may be drawing to a close if the young whites don’t want to turn up to watch non-pale people play.

        “The people running the school, like the people running the West, are saying it is not okay to be white.”Our intellectuals and our betters have been saying this for decades. The individuals quoted below are totally your fellow white people. Totally. It would be a hate crime to think otherwise. Definitely do NOT try to come up with anything these persons might have in common. I’m telling you they don’t — other than being leading lights of our culture.[…] there must be something terribly wrong with Western white civilization. […] The truth is that Mozart, Pascal, Boolean algebra, Shakespeare, parliamentary government, baroque churches, Newton, the emancipation of women, Kant, Marx, Balanchine ballets, et al, don’t redeem what this particular civilization has wrought upon the world. The white race is the cancer of human history […] which now threatens the very existence of life itself.Susan Sontag, The Partisan Review, 1967When it comes to abolishing the white race, the task is not to win over more whites to oppose “racism”; there are “anti-racists” enough already to do the job. The task is to gather together a minority determined to make it impossible for anyone to be white.Noel Ignatiev, “The Making and Unmaking of Whiteness”, 1997If white men were not complaining, it would be an indication that we weren’t succeeding, and making the inroads that we are.Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr

        Malcolm Muggeridge recognized this suicide cult nearly fifty years ago in a 1974 speech stating: Western man has decided to abolish himself…….blowing the trumpet that brings the walls of his own city tumbling down………finally, having educated himself into imbecility, and polluted and drugged himself into stupefaction, he kneels over, a weary battered old brontosaurus, and becomes extinct. That about covers it.

        We have lots of shooting ranges here in America and lots of suburban 2nd amendment guys. We can shoot the wings off a gnat at 20 yards.But the progressives will chip away at our rights and especially our speech rights and tell us that when a white girl is raped and stabbed we can’t be racist about it. Or say anything threatening.It’s a religion, this whole progressive thing has taken on theological powers.Stay in your suburbia and collect your weapons, go to the range, and die a natural death.Stay away from the new religion and don’t threaten it.The sooner you pass on the better “ white supremist”.That is essentially the message of the new religion to white male America and I am afraid that our testosterone is so low in the next generation of white men that our numbers to resist the destruction of our civilization is not going to be there.

            Yep. It’s not about the guns, though they would help. Muslims in Europe and even to a degree in the United States show that fighting the GloboHomo religion is about pushing back as a group, about having a group that you can rely on.
Muslims are idiots and mostly unarmed in Europe, but they’re able to fight back. They are creating their own communities and running those communities according to their values and religion, not GloboHomo. It isn’t about the guns. It’s about having your own community that’s willing to push back legally, financially and on the streets.

                This is correct. British Muslims are not armed either but they get their way by threatening “trouble” and being willing to act on that threat. They will always stick up for each and stick together, regardless of the situation. White people won’t do that. Indeed, I am beginning to think that we can’t do it either. So they win and we lose.

            A proposed bill in Virginia, will make two people attending together or talking on a gun range illegal.  Even two people practicing in martial arts will be considered illegal militia training in domestic terrorism.
Bloomberg funded.  So soon even talking training or enthusiast tips online will be illegal.(It already technically is, under the wording of the bill.)

            A baseball fan who received a lifetime ban from Wrigley Field can tell you what’s perceived as a “racist gesture.”  The fan was behind Doug Glanville, a black reporter, and made the “okay” sign on camera.  The Chicago Cubs ownership moved swiftly and decisively to remove this “dangerous” fan from Wrigley Field forever.  Never mind that the fan could have been playing the “circle game.”  There’s no room for giving the fan the benefit of doubt when the possibility of racism (gasp!) is present at Wrigley Field.

        Of note, the election that the UK establishment tried to scare Boris out of because they knew what would happen if the British people got another bite at the Brexit apple, has been a total wipeout for the Labor party…The gap between the rules and the ruled continues to widen as the people subjugated to the ruling elites are throwing those ruling elites out on their pompous asses.This hater story is emblematic of the gap.  It’s a pure Government Party firestorm.If they can now get Brexit done, get a trade deal with the USA done, and get their immigration under control, the UK might not yet be dead.  That’s what this is all about, after all.  We can laugh about the Government Party over there virtue signalling their anti-racism, but it seems to me that your average British citizen is a polite person who isn’t buying what the Government Party is selling.  And the sooner Brexit gets done, the sooner they can get their immigration policies under control.I bet that knife attack last week was the final straw for a lot of them…Here in the USA…Brexit was the warning flag that announced the coming of Trump.  I suspect that weak-kneed Democrats are getting the news out of the UK and thinking, “Oh my, what are we doing?”  Next week’s impeachment vote is going to be interesting.If the Democrats back down, they might as well not even bother selecting a Presidential candidate because their own voters will walk…and GOP voters are going to remain in a white-hot rage for the next 10 months.If they pass impeachment, an already-furious GOP is going to do to the Democrats what UK voters have done to Labour…and 55-65% of “independents” will vote with the GOP.Buckle up, kids.

        What I still can’t find a satisfactory explanation for, is the alacrity with which most whites will still buy into or throw in with the Suicide Cult. Not those who profit by it, not the doom cleresy or the professional prelates. The clueless, average white man.In my experience, mindless, quasi-robotic, unquestioned endorsement still prevails among normie Whites when surveyed privately on “combatting racism” and “fighting hate”. In an age when austere forbearance and selflessness abnegation have been otherwise expunged from the public consciousness (this is the emotionally incontinent, solipsistic, do-as I-please look-at-me era after all), they still hold the sadly familiar, obscenely inverted set of “virtues” as sacred, even as they bear the brunt of their destructiveness.Having been guilt-tripped from birth doesn’t begin to account for the ease with which a populace of cynics and materialists who a generation ago adopted perpetual rebelliousness as a way of life, has been whipped into mindless religious conformism.Going along to get along is no longer a worthwhile proposition for the average man. Paying lip service to the buncombe, boomer-style, is no longer a gratuitous act of formulaic piousness, what with the barbarian no longer being a distant figure whose side one can take at no cost to one’s own.  Nor does it guarantee safety from your friendly neighborhood astroturfed outrage mob any longer, as the bar of untouchability for the devout is being raised on the daily. For the nihilistic careerist, one-upmanship is now untenable and costly. The day-to-day incentive for either desultory or ostentatious piousness isn’t there any more.As for the fabled SnowPipo’s fear of ostracism, the dislocation of community life and general atomization of western man’ existence mean the fallout from going against the grain is greatly diminished.The redirected Christian zeal hypothesis is belied by the selectiveness with which the purported christian ideals have been repurposed. If people yearn for a chance to display repentance, altruism and charity, why does the pent-up, transmuted holier-that-thou-ism magically stop short of mindfulness of hubris and general humility before the natural order?Besides, I find it hard to believe that blind faith in the gods of progress, or a twisted desire to bear a cross, can survive prolonged familiarity with streetshitting and machete attacks.Fear of material retribution – through jail time, job loss, etc. – might get a man to resign himself to his own demise, and hopelessness might inspire passivity, but reluctant acquiescence isn’t what’s puzzling. When people feel trapped or cornered, they have a way of lashing out or going limp from apathy, not clamoring for more.

            I don’t think most whites buy into it; they ignore it, quietly abhor it, or consciously avoid the issue.
The reason why whites have this suicidal impulse is the subject of many interesting studies nowadays. One part white guilt (education/media-driven), one part innate ethno-masochism, one part innate high-trust quotient.

                IMO, although media propaganda is often talked about, I don’t think most people really understand how powerful it is. An easy way to see it is in the anti-Trump crowd. The media isn’t just influencing them, they have created a backwards reality that, for practicle purposes, turns into real reality for these people…I just don’t think the power of media is truely understood enough…

            Or, to put it another way, boys growing up win some fistfights and lose some, too, and they establish themselves in the pecking order, wherever that might be.  Other boys never fight at all, just give some lip and run away.  Our western white male culture is dominated by too few of the former and too many of the latter.  The question is, is there a point where those who have never stood up for themselves finally take a stand?  My best guess is never. Pure obeisance to domination by others.

            The problem is the average American, REFUSES to organize and get politically active.  He will grumble and complain. He will run away to the exburbs. He’ll talk about his guns and some cabin in the woods. BUT he will NOT turn off the TV, put down the beer, ORGANIZE with others and stay politically active. Nope, too boring. Too much work. Too much controversy. What about work? what the family? what about football? So, grumble complain, accept – and eventually die.

        Indeed it’s a suicide cult but they plan on getting rid of us as well, in fact most of the Western world.
It’s the mega version of Jim Jones mass suicide  in French Guyana. And you know damn well they intend for us to drink the Cyanide laced fruit punch.  So we better start formulating a survival strategy to prevent this from happening.
We can see a bit of what they intend when you look at Virginia and the laws they intend to pass and ithis is just the beginning. Just wait when Trump leaves.

        “It is a religion built around the hatred of white people largely by white people”—-on some kind of meal ticket far removed from providing a good or service to society.  That’s the key.  All of these people have little safe space jobs in air conditioned office buildings somehow, some way, financed by taxpayers, even non-profits on grant money.  The British government, among others, is just as prolific as ours in stacking up bureaucrats like cord wood.  Giant sand boxes for crazies to play in.

        The fact that the same symptoms are incurring in the white world over the entire Globe does make me think it is for the most part out of our control and is just some sort of cyclical happening.

        I’ve posted this before, but it bears repeating: white people are the only demographic group that doesn’t view their race as central to their identity, and it’s not even close.https://tinyurl.com/tjmjzteIs this the result of conditioning, genetics, or some combination of the two (as most traits are?)  What should be noted is the demographic ascendants don’t share this view at all.

        Virtue signaling idiots need their own homeland. They should be caned before given their one way ticket to nowhere. I like the idea of dropping them off in Afghanistan Pakistan or South Africa. They will add to the vibrancy quotient in those wonderful places. The Middle East needs idiots too.

        No, not mass suicide. Yes, the species is declining due to the extinction of real hardship, and a collapse is both inevitable and  a necessary correction; but the future is not a Jonestown. Rather, there will be a tipping point, an interregnum of chaos, a spasm of Jackboot reaction, and then culling of the disease. The bad actors are relatively few and mortal nonetheless. They will not be missed.

        What’s amazing about the UK election isn’t that Labour lost, its that they got almost 200 seats! The ran the absolute worst candidate ever.  A Snotty goofball, who was half-traitor and half-liar. If the USSR had ever conquered the UK,  someone like Corbyn would’ve been their English Puppet dictator.  Yep, STILL 200 seats. Anyway, maybe the UK will now get Brexit – after being lied to for 3 years.

            Keep in mind that those Labour seats are mostly “safe” seats.  The contested,  close races look like they almost all went Tory.  Just like here, where CA and NY are write-offs no matter what.

            The Labour Party still has deep roots in certain traditional “heartlands” areas. They have always done well in the inner cities and they will dominate London (rather like the Democrats dominate New York).
Add to this, of course, the demographic changes in the UK.

        In his famous speech at Harvard in 1978, Alexander Solzsenytsin had a few words about the possible contortions of a legalistic society (well before we had 300,000 laws on the books with which to entrap everyone for everything) and Progressivism:

        Conservative Inc would love to be able to say “Diversity is a conservative value”, and “Diversity is not just our strength, it is our greatest strength”. But they know that its a bridge too far for those out in the hinterland. Inside the Beltway, it is clear that this is what they actually believe. But we should not mourn Boomercons just yet, among Gen Y/Z there really are no “mainstream conservatives”, its either Leftist or Dissident Right. This will change though as Millennials age and become less econ left. Their cultural values won’t undergo the same shift.

        The walls are closing in. The signs are becoming too obvious to miss. Even the oblivious, the nice, the slowest, the brainwashed whites are waking up to the danger we are in. The space between the walls will continue to shrink until there is some push back. The persecution of a white brother in Hooterville is OUR persecution. His fight is OUR fight. United we stand, divided we fall. . Now is the time to come to the defense of our countrymen!How?A legal defense fund? Sue the bastards.Demonstrate, protest, speak out. There has to be push back. Never never never let them take away our guns.We need to find a leader. A firebrand. The feeling is there. We are still many. We just need a leader. A white Barack Obama. A Robert E. Lee, a Dominic Cummings.“Hard pressed on my right. My center is yielding. Impossible to maneuver. Situation excellent.

England is voting today.  Lets see how far they can take this without having an actual KGB.  If Americans can find their balls perhaps so can the english.

        “We came from the same place and we all go to the same place when it’s all said and done.”   Sounds more like that religion you guys think should be brought back to run our lives, rather than anything to do with “the end point of the Enlightenment” or “liberal democracy”
