        I suppose here‚Äôs as good as any place to mention, just in passing, of course, that NRO has recently abandoned its anonymous, Disqus-based commenting system in favor of Facebook.  If that doesn‚Äôt spell it all out with a big middle finger, what will?

                            In fairness, the English have different ways. The English endeavor to be interesting, even if it means being silly and pretentious. Americans endeavor to be earnest and candid, even if it means being dull and predictable. Still, the guy is a ridiculous poof.

                            Severian, you likely have ‚ÄúBackpfeifengesicht‚Äù in mind. Unfortunately though, a Backpfeife is just a slap in the face, not the fistblow that you‚Äôre thinking of for that supremely qualified fellow. We Germans being essentially a gentle nation, we don‚Äôt have a fixed expression for a face deserving the latter kind of treatment.

                            @Karl Horst and Herzog, thanks very much!  Obviously I don‚Äôt know any German, but it seems to be sublimely useful for both philosophizing with people, and insulting them.  (I had a buddy in grad school spend a half hour trying to explain exactly whataufhebenmeans (yes, we‚Äôd been drinking at the time).  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd really get Hegel anyway, but ‚Ä¶.).  And again, this is why I come here: I learn stuff.

                                I love German ‚Äì studied it in high school and university.  I think my interest was piqued by reading Mark Twain‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Awful German Language‚Äù.  His complaint about the famous German ‚Äúportmanteau words‚Äù has never been bettered:  ‚ÄúThese things are not words, they are alphabetical processions.‚Äù  Surely such a gifted language could come up with something like FistPunchDeservingFace!

                                    @ Dr. Mabuse ‚Äì Many people struggle with the German language, it is challenging. Die, Der, Das is horrible for everyone because there‚Äôs no sense to it. Also, you may remember ‚ÄòDu‚Äô and ‚ÄòSie‚Äô used as the familiar and formal version of ‚Äòyou‚Äô. Helmut Kohl once said to President Bush in English ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou can say you to me‚Äù to let Mr. Bush know it was okay to use the informal ‚ÄòDu‚Äô rather than ‚ÄòSie‚Äô which in German makes sense, but in English just sounds silly.

                                        The first Oktoberfest I went to, the first thing I saw was two Polizei dragging an unconscious man, by one ankle each, face down through a gravel parking lot to their cruiser.  When I went in, I asked what happened‚Äì they told me that he had used ‚ÄúDu‚Äù to the Polizei, so they beat the **** out of him on the spot, with spring-loaded truncheons.
Now THAT, my friends, is a Grammar Nazi.  PS, all the Germans thought that the guy deserved the ***-whuppin‚Äô, and they didn‚Äôt miss a beat on the drinking songs, etc.

                    One of my favorite sites to read comments at was always HotAir.com. Not necessarily due to the caliber of the commenters &amp; their intellectual comments,but because for a decade, these folks were dedicated &amp; had formed a family. It was always nice to check their reactions to everyday events. However, the Salem owned sites forced a move to FB comments, telling their commenters to break the rules of Facebook and risk getting banned, by using a pseudonym acct to allow them to speak freely. These decade long devoted commenters got shivved all on one day &amp; told to get over it. What an absolutely stupid move to destroy your base of readers.

        All of this goes double for academia, as I‚Äôm sure you know.  Journos, I imagine, have to *actively* practice crimestop, as they‚Äôre forced to write in plain English ‚Äî they‚Äôre still dumb as goldfish, but have to have at least a little something on the ball.  In my experience, academia is a guild profession and lots of them ‚Äî 2nd and 3rd generation profs ‚Äî may well be honestly ignorant of anything outside the ivory tower.  And since they speak in a code known only to themselves‚Ä¶. I remember sitting in a seminar room once, everyone serially agreeing that Human Rights can only be achieved when the nation state is no more.  When it was my turn, I pointed out that, under this logic, the Normandy invasion was a giant violation of the Wehrmacht‚Äôs human rights and FDR should‚Äôve been right there in the dock with Goering at Nuremberg.  Fun stuff.  There is no stupidity like tertiary-degreed stupidity.

        ‚ÄúThe press has always been staffed by obsequious rumpswabs and toadies.‚Äù
Not always. Read the reminiscences H.L. Mencken, Charles Anderson Dana, Ben Hecht and a slew of others on the newspapering of their early days, A intelligent high school kid like Mencken could show up at a newspaper office, get hired on for menial tasks, work his way up by diligent curiosity and clear writing to the top of journalism.
His counterparts today are paid for indolence and incuriosity and, as Zman points out, being not overburdened with intelligence.

        I don‚Äôt comment on sites that use only Facebook for their comments section, but that‚Äôs the point, I guess. Completely transparent form of censorship. Apparently it is thought that if people use their ‚Äúreal‚Äù identity, they will be more temperate in their commenting. Although if you take a look over at Huffposts‚Äô comments you can read the most vile things about Anyone Who is Not a Progressive Leftist. I must admit I like to spy on the enemy on occasion. Not too often, though, because it‚Äôs nauseating to read what these people think. Sometimes I think, are we even living in the same country?

                I get you, but I feel it‚Äôs always instructive to know what your enemy is thinking. In a general sense, ya we know, but to see it there, in black &amp; white, and knowing that they actually believe the effluvium coming from their mouths, is a whole lotta ‚Äù knowing‚Äù.

        Oh dear Lord this was funny‚Ä¶in light of one of my son‚Äôs describing another of the ESPN ‚Äúgoldfish‚Äù crew that hung out on weekends at the golf club he worked at this past summer‚Äìdrinking, carousing and generally being a complete dick to the entire staff, as well as other members.   Seriously, though. live in a town heavily populated by media types and the other operative issue is that most have just enough IQ to be truly resentful of having to live on the economic outskirts, though they may have gone to the same schools as the lawyers, software guys and investment bankers. That resentment shines through in most of their reportage.

        Most journalists are so stupid, they‚Äôd support the repeal of the first amendment, which would put them out of jobs.
As a footnote, here‚Äôs Kafka on sitting still:
You do not need to leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. Do not even listen, simply wait, be quiet still and solitary. The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked, it has no choice, it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.
I‚Äôm pretty sure K learned this from the school of life, the only school where anybody actually learns anything.

        It‚Äôs virtually impossible to read a mainstream article about firearms, firearm laws, and the enthusiast community that enjoys them without noticing at least two or three glaring, factual errors in every paragraph. Sometimes even in one sentence.  They get corrected, and corrected, and corrected some more in the comments section by knowledgeable readers.And what happens the following week? Another similar article in the same publication with basically the same errors.No wonder the reporters/editors don‚Äôt like comments. When they are made to look foolish and ignorant to their readership it shreds even the smallest amount of credibility they have left.

        Orwell knew what kind of people ‚Äújournalists‚Äù were. They were a key component of ‚ÄúIngsoc‚Äù, the totalitarian socialist party that ruled Oceania. ‚ÄúThe new aristocracy was made up for the most part by bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, unionists, publicists, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians‚Ä¶they were hungrier for pure power and ‚Ä¶intent on crushing opposition.‚Äù (1984, p. 206). Orwell, a journalist himself, knew journalists were toadies who lusted after power and prestige. The American version of Ingsoc‚Äìthe new Democratic Party/ BLM/ OWS/SJW/ crowd‚Äìwill employ hordes of Brian Williamses  and Keith Olbermans to duckspeak the Party Line. Which they do already.

        Well, these poor journalists will fine their egos even more bruised when they are out of work.  The comments sections keep people coming back.  If you take away the comments, then there is less interaction and there is less reason to read any particular publication or writer.  Loss of comments will serve neither the publication, the writers, or the readers.  Lose, lose, lose.

        Bravo! Well written and totally on target. I‚Äôve ended up exchanging emails with ‚Äújournalists‚Äù for several major newspapers, and the results were always the same. I buried their arguments with so many details they lashed out in anger. I then noted that my previous reply contained ‚Äún‚Äù facts in support of my argument, but the professional failed to dispute any of them or offered any facts to support their argument. No reply.

        It seems clear to me that those organizations which have closed down the comments section simply don‚Äôt understand economics.
They believe the advertising will keep the afloat
And then fail to realize that said advertising will dribble away when the advertisers realize there is nobody reading their ads.
As for socialist sites such as Huffpo?  I liken them to the screeching of geese overhead.  Annoying as hell, but it tells you where the flock is headed.

        Yes, the comments section often tells the Real Untold Story the journalists left out.  Too often, journalists are trying to report as little as possible about politically incorrect stories where ‚Äúurban youths‚Äù are on a rampage or who exactly these people are who shoot up crowds while shouting ‚ÄúAllahu Akbar!‚Äù  Very often, the media expends more effort not reporting things than reporting them.

        The media likes to boast that they will hold the powerful accountable, but believe there is no need for anyone to hold them accountable.

        What, exactly, prevents a journalism enterprise from hiring high school grads again? Indeed, what prevents them from hiring high school students? What is killing journalism is the high cost basis compared to the income potential. Why is hiring college graduates, with their higher cost basis, considered a necessity instead of an extravagance? It‚Äôs not like the college boys are capable of turning out error free copy or frequently insightful analysis.

        Probably too late to post: It‚Äôs just shady fun to mock J Majors (talk about a target-rich environment_!), but the smug Spectator poofter has a half-pont in that there seems to be a species of monomaniacal, likely paid, trolls that endeavor to ruin comment threads, particularly in right-sites as a species of agitprop.  The answer is, of course. an ongoing active effort to ban/block them.  But that adds work/cost as well as value.

        I was in a writing program at the local college back in the mid 1980‚Äôs. I had lots of classes with folks of various sorts, such as the ‚Äúcreative writing‚Äù types, and journalism students. With only one exception, the journalism students struck me as the least intelligent and least intellectually curious of all the writing students. The one exception, a man in his early 30s, had already been working as a newspaper reporter for years, but his employer wanted him to get a degree, for some reason I never quite understood.

        ‚ÄúMost journalists are so stupid, they‚Äôd support the repeal of the first amendment, which would put them out of jobs.‚ÄùI am convinced that most of them would be just fine working for the Ministry of Truth, doing nothing but regurgitating government propaganda and writing Unpersons out of history.  They would be paid bureaucrats and would not have to worry about losing their jobs due to low ratings and declining circulation.  They would also not have to spend any time at all even creating an illusion of balance and since they really don‚Äôt want to work very hard, they would welcome an end to the irksome task of getting ‚Äúboth sides of the story.‚Äù  Not that they bother much with it now.

            In many ways they already are working for Ministry of Truth. Think back to the many articles this week that you read written around the presumption of Hillary‚Äôs pneumonia. While we‚Äôve been watching her fall and struggle up stairs (as I do myself) for years, watching her cough all this year. And now see her actually collapse, and spring back within just a few hours. Voila! We‚Äôve seen for ourselves Fresnel prism lenses, Zeiss lenses, and coughing still. But yeah, frame the stories around pneumonia

        A PhD in the sociology of theology is slightly more useful than a degree in sitting still if a large part of your income derives from writing for religious publications such as The Catholic Herald. Which Thompson does write for, as well as other, similar publications.I think you‚Äôre also being unfair to him by dismissing, without any evidence, his assertion that advertisers are no longer just interested in page view stats but want more sophisticated analytics, the better to get more bang for their buck. It‚Äôs also unfair to criticise Thompson‚Äôs observation that commenters have ‚Äòa sharp eye for the fragility of the journalistic ego‚Äô, then turn that into  ‚Äòthe comments have become the place that make the writers cry‚Äô and run with that, as though that was not the very point Thompson was making. Sort of having your cake and eating it, no?The other point that‚Äôs relevant, which Thompson didn‚Äôt make, is that in the UK, comments on the big news sites really have to be moderated, a high maintenance job that‚Äôs necessitated by the UK having such strict (and if you lose, hideously expensive) libel laws.Yes, there are some dumb journalists out there in interweb land. But Thompson is a little more nuanced and intelligent than you give him credit for.
