        It’s not even cpt, it’s “i got the job, now I dare you to fire me” that gets me the most upset with a lot of the blacks I work with.
Sense of entitlement is a pretty big impediment to being productive.

            Agree.Some say it’s not attitude, but it is. Black students revel in coming late to class, with much “hi, are ya,” “sup?” “hey man” to others on their way to their seat. Suits the histrionic side of them, and is I “I’ll come when I’m good and ready” to teachers,. esp white ones.Also, if the teacher mentions it, it gives them a chance to look fake-bewildered, grin at a classmate and “joke,” “That bitch gettin’ on me all the time.”

        I think you hit on the important point when you say “they got nowhere to go and all day to get there.”  That’s why they don’t care about time.  They’ve got shitloads of time, all the hours of the day for the whole long government-sponsored life ahead of them.  Who gives two shits if they have to wait an extra five minutes for their Subway sandwich?  What, they got a quality team meeting coming up?  They’re out eating because it’s something different, and standing around the store is still “something different”.

        Oh yeah,Mo-kita?Mok-i-ta?Where does the accent go?Is “tacit” a reasonable translation, or is mokita ALWAYS about “something deemed unflattering to say by some”?The wiki link wasn’t too helpful here.

        SWPL ” If you’re good at what you do, you get an assistant at work to help you make the most of your time.”?Funny, I was so good I didn’t NEED help, except on really big, or “It just takes two to move it” projects. I HAVE noticed some women who supplant a male in certain “management” positions suddenly discover “It’s too much for one person”. AND with a higher wage, get an “assistant” (or “associate”, usually a friend) to do all that trivial stuff.SWPL, “Bohemian”? MY WASP (Episcopalian) ancestors used the term Bohemian in lieu of “gauche”. It doesn’t imply cool OR edgy. Regional colloquialism I suppose.

        re: “Anyway, I think that’s the dividing line in modern life. The great class line is is time preference. Conventional wisdom says the poor lack impulse control. They buy cheap crap now rather than save for better things later. They don’t understand the value of putting off today’s pleasure for something better tomorrow.I don’t think that’s right. I think it is the lack of time preference.” thezmanYou have struck gold but Edward C. Banfield wrote about it nearly a half century ago. If you haven’t heard of him before you owe it to yourself to read his book The Unheavenly City Revisited, 1974, which is the revised 1970 book titled The Unheavenly City. Time preference is Banfield’s analytical instrument used to delineate his five classes in society. It is a book well worth reading.Dan Kurt

        I have worked, and work still, with entry level Mexicans and middle class blacks. In my experience CPT has has by no means abandoned that middle class, which demonstrates your cockeyed optimism.

        Discount function, delayed gratification, whatever you want to call it, IME this is a central feature of all poverty.
You could give a loser an honest-to-God ‘get out of jail free’ card and rather than save it pending the outcome of his upcoming murder trial he’ll use it to shorten his current two-week stint for failure to pay child support.
Even after the lifer bars slam behind him he still wont understand what he screwed up.
