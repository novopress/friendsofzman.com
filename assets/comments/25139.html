        Ends must be supported by Ways and Means, but there are none.The Ends then are better left unsaid and the Means ORGANIZED then the Ways shall be enabled and constrained by means and marshaled towards Ends.Or: until you have more than complaints in one hand and shit in the other perhaps it’s best to stop challenging powerful groups with enormous means, ruthless ways whose End is POWER and they tolerate no Challenge.Conservatism is utterly vanquished and discredited so you can stop kicking the dead horse.   Instead go get some horses, fodder and carts for the now orphaned to defect to…not ideas.  F_ck ideas.  Get something real.Reaction is tolerated because it is a gripe club of less than 200 posters including the Feds.  A joke.  Not worth mentioning nor mentioned since 2016.Harmless eccentrics not worth mentioning.So no yer not Samzidat, just online comedy, go make something real and perhaps people will follow.Until then it’s all Democrats, all Cathedral, all Woke because nothing else exists.

        Anyone else check the newswires in the past few hours?
Now our idiot media is earnestly trying to claim that Beer Flu has killed as many USonians as the 1918-19 Spanish Flu.
I hate this timeline.

            Wild Geese – The construction workers (tradies) are marching en mass in Melbourne after the government shut them down when they opposed enforced vaxxing.  Suddenly all those cops that were pepper spraying and mobbing grandmas aren’t so eager for confrontations.
Ignore the mainstream media.  Their goal is to lie and convince you the fight is lost.  You can’t change what they’re doing and you generally can’t reach most normies, so tune it all out.  Focus on something positive, go workout, read a good book, watch the tradies marching.  Don’t let the media manipulate your emotions.

                Good advice 3g4me.
Find a few ppl whose words you trust and ignore the rest. News is supposed to be an account of what happened, however our propaganda media is an account of what didn’t happen. Psyops.
Don’t despair, but if you do, carry on anyway.

        Reading Colin Woodard’s “American Nations” … the point he makes is that the elite of New England were solidly in favor of Independence, as their own privileges were revoked. New York and Pennsylvania were abstainers, as their privileges of long standing self rule and their local big shots making big, were not at risk. Tidewater Virginia came down for Independence as the local gentry there like Washington and Jefferson certainly were at risk.* Appalachia split between the northern part fearing British arming the Indians to keep them East and the southern part where a grudge against the Deep South gentry made them back the British.*Woodard makes the case that the key cause of the American Revolution was the new London Elite determined to revoke the freedom of the local American elites in a massive centralization scheme. Revoking both Tidewater Gentry’s ability to run things for themselves and New England’s.Point being that the constant surveillance is done to kick people out of power, positions, and such often by those wanting their jobs. Some will stick to their ideology, even then, but not many. And especially for White men, power and position is everything. Most can and will see this as an existential threat to their ability to attract/keep a mate, family, etc. and will turn against it. Salem Witch trials abruptly ended the moment the Governor’s Wife was accused. It just needs to rise high enough which human nature guarantees — there are no shortage of diverse and empowered, stunning and brave people of BIPOC or S.H.I.E.L.D. or whatever that want someone else’s job.

        Speaking of what Grog thinks of Trog, it’s been such a pleasure to hear the loud, lyrical chants of “F joe biden”. The only way it could be any sweeter would be for them to follow up with “F george bush”. Obama often spoke about fundamentally transforming America but he really didn’t need to as bush jr. was such a disaster on so many levels. From immigration, wars and spending to the massive expansion of the surveillance state. His recent remarks comparing those who attended the Jan 6 rally to terrorists were absolutely abhorrent. At least he is opening the eyes of “normie”, civic nationalist conservatives and disclosing what the republicans truly think about them.

                    There was a book I had concerning quotes from Coolidge.  I loaned it out and it’s now long gone.  But I remember being impressed, very impressed.  If silent Cal was hesitant to run off at the mouth, he was nevertheless a deep thinker.  His conservative bent was everything that once made this nation great.  Too bad we didn’t listen.

                        President Coolidge and his wife were being given a tour of a farm. They each had their entourage which visited different parts of the farm at different times.When Mrs. Coolidge reached the chicken coop area, she was amazed at the… shall we say activity of a certain rooster. She asked the tour guide how often the rooster has relations. ’20 times a day, ma’am’. ‘Wow!’ She exclaimed. ‘Can you please tell that to the President when he arrives?’Later, the President arrives at the chicken coop. The tour guide approaches him ‘Sir, the First Lady wanted me to show you that rooster. He has relations 20 times a day.’Silent Cal furrows his brow ‘ Same hen every time?’‘No, Mr. President. A different hen every time.’‘Please tell that to the First Lady.’

            Bush is the ultimate scumbag. However, chanting “F Bush” would be gleefully interpreted by the Enemedia as pushback against the “F Biden” chants. Now if we could get people to chant “F Bush and Biden,” the problem would be solved.

            I suspect the “FJB” chants at college sportsball games are an expression of anger towards the “ruining” of the “College Experience”. Now every poster here could recite chapter and verse why you shouldn’t attend college (Severian I’m looking at you), but young adults still want to get the “College Experience”:– Party– Chase romance (OK, chase sex)– Attend sporting events– Make new friends– Party– Get the Hell Away from their parents (although from what I’ve heard, this may not always be the case)– Potentially learn employable skillsSo you go tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to go to Big State U or Ivy U and then all the sudden you’re sent home (and still pay room and board) or locked in your rooms, masked up, taking classes over Zoom, no sports, no parties, no romancin’, no fun.Yeah, I’d be upset too. And looking for someone to blame.

                Long term it’s a good thing. Certainly nothing wrong with partying or finding love but people are getting thousands into debt for useless degrees, just to act like total degenerates for 4 years.
Meanwhile the asian invasion into STEM and other paying fields continues unabated while the white guys are drinking every day and finishing their kinesiology degrees.

                Yeah, I won’t get started — I could write you a book — but even I get it: College rules. I myself chased as much tail as anyone back in my undergrad days, took the old marketing slogan “Drink Canada Dry” as a personal challenge, and if I didn’t attend too many sporting events, it was because my alma mater were cellar-dwellers in the Yalta Conference. Best four years of my life, if by “best” you mean “experiences so great, I wish I could remember a lot more about them.”If college were just that, and you happened to learn a few things on the side, then I’d say it’s worth going (although not at today’s ridiculous prices). But it’s not, and the few things that are even kinda sorta like that are being ruined.Yeah, F Joe Biden indeed. The only question is, is this puerile “rebellion,” or do they mean it? We’ll soon find out.

        Re Z’s excellent Taki’s column on the one sided morality war… The Left has established the acceptable morality that is enforced by all institutions while the Right still talks facts. Consequently, as Z notes, the Right always loses to the Left.It took the Left 100 years to get us to the point where we are at today: a rapidly deteriorating country with a gynocentric morality system. If you look at the things our side wants (such as a good economy, individual freedom including free association and the ability to be left alone, strong borders and due process) those are all very patriarchal goals. Our prevailing morality is centered on things like compassion, inclusion, equality of outcome, big government, women having it all, open borders, bonding over hysteria, etc. Those are moral values that most appeal to women.To change at this point from a female to a male centric moral system will take at least another 100 years and probably longer since we control zero, zip of the institutions.Our role as bad people needs to be helping others on the right understand that we are losing due our not controlling the moral framework of the culture

        ” The collapse of privacy is turning America into a large-scale prison camp.”Absolutely true, but an even more disturbing aspect is how many mostly White Americans want to be prisoners. There is an absolute thirst on a part of many, and it may even be the majority, to submit to authority and follow all official narratives no matter how transparently false. In my decades on earth, this has been the greatest sea change in beliefs and behavior in the Anglosphere. Even propaganda has a niche audience who enjoys being misled and deceived. In a total inversion, this desire to submit is now stronger in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand than it is in Germany and the Scandinavian countries.There are diminishing regions, particularly the South and Appalachia but certainly not exclusively there, where opposition to authority remains strong. It intensifies the  hatred outsiders have toward  these areas. If John Carpenter honestly remade THEY LIVE, the protagonists likely would be happy to realize they are being manipulated.While he was (and justifiably so in many ways) widely derided for claiming the CCP leadership depends on citizen support in China, it is not untrue as far as it goes. Police states require substantial acquiescence and, unfortunately, that isn’t hard to attain in contemporary America.

            The acquiescence will evaporate as soon as the gravy train stops running.Our government has proactively seduced the US population into parasitic servitude via endless handouts and a subsidized artificially high standard of living for every voting block. Even our poorest class of citizens (and illegals for that matter) can easily acquire food, housing, medical care, education, and a base income for starters. And most now have multiple automobiles, cell phones, flat screen TVs, computers, and an expensive wardrobe to boot. Who wouldn’t sell their vote for ride on the gravy train? But can the gravy train run forever without productivity behind it? Methinks not.

                “The acquiescence will evaporate as soon as the gravy train stops running.”We are probably seeing the fog of a war between elites.The Deep State Swamp vs China’s puppets vs the 1001 Club (the Davos class).If the US loses its ability to project military force, the dollar loses its reserve currency status, and all the Pentagon profits and pensions go away.China’s puppets would benefit as viceroys in a satrapy.The 1001 Club has to lays bet on both sides, trying to ride two tigers, as we proles are eating up their resources.This is a war of survival, at the top.But, as Dobson notes, the most remarkable thing in the Anglosphere is the war on the proles. Instead of ‘citizen of the world’, the small hats and their century long war of the mind have succeeded in creating a beta class that longs for an alpha- a ‘congregant of the world’.“Pick me, pick me!” they cry, hoping to be saved from the sins that keep them out of the Garden of secure incomes, fine homes, and diversity-free neighborhoods.  With tickets to exotic human zoos for spice, proof that they are worthy.What can we offer them?  Even their own children are fashion accessories, and their ancestors are despicable.

                        Disagree although “war” may be an overstatement. There is a discernible schism over China as laid out above. You see that most widely in the division between the MIC/Corporate Clown World and State/Israel/IC. Biden has been on the take from the PRC for years and those who control him want to keep lapping up the Chinese cash, and the (ironically) non-military component is sabre rattling.

            The sense of rebellion, non-conformity and independence has almost completely vanished throughout the western world. In its place reigns an ovine slavishness and utter docility, not to mention an abject unwillingness to think for one’s self. And this general collapse of one’s self-respect as an autonomous human being seems to have transpired in about 15 years time. Frankly, it is dumbfounding.

                    My general regard for the human race–already far from stratospheric, mark you–has taken a huge hit over the last couple of years. How can one esteem highly a species that is so servile and frankly stupid?

        The whole point of the “digital panopticon” is self-censorship. Only the dissident or the creative person needs privacy. The hive minds act out publicly – that’s the whole point. The intent of our rulers is ultimately to have us censor ourselves because it’s a lot easier for them.
Who among us has not already censored himself or herself to some degree. I know I have. It’s complete professional suicide otherwise. I mainly look forward to retirement so I can “let it all hang out” (metaphorically of course) from some undisclosed redoubt.

            Excellent point, but there is a distinction between self-preservation and voluntary recreational self-censorship. It is the latter that is most disturbing. It’s an indicia of a strange religion.

        Those of us with a libertarian mindset couldn’t understand why conservatives eagerly embraced the drug testing racket, which came from the drug war racket.
Neither racket benefitted society, and their social effects resound far outside the very narrow channel of legal decrees (which were themselves based on previous rackets).
Go ahead, define “less”.  Less harmful, less sick, less costly.
It seems to me that the opportunities for virtue signaling were simply too great.

            Those evils you cite wrt drug usage came from the same thinking as we seem to suffer from today.  In the bad old days, when drug use exploded, we thought we could win the “war on drugs”—so everything goes.  We lost.
Today we fight a war on Covid.  We think we can eradicate a viral disease, so everything goes.  We’ll keep escalating until exhaustion.  All damage to individuals and society is “collateral” and those in control are to be held harmless—a general, a President, or your next door neighbor.

                    Winning is never the point of starting a forever war on a nebulous concept (“terrorism”) or endemic, widely dispersed diseases whether of the social variety (drug use) or the physical (a virus known for especially rapid mutation and easy spread). There are usually two motives behind these things. Obviously control of people is a main driving force but financial gain is always there too and the same people tend to be in position to benefit from both.The seemingly sudden abandonment of a major front in the “War on Terror” in Afghanistan may be reason for a sort of grim hope, the hope that the exhaustion phase Compsci alluded to above is nearing at least for one of the ruling class’ demonic little projects.As a PoD (person of dirt) I can only guess. Z’s metaphor of the old sovietologists trying to discern the state of the Inner Party from the color of Khrushchev’s tie applies here too. If Afghanistan was the first of the balls they were juggling to fall, the others may slip away with little notice as well.

            We can argue about ‘benefits’.What is disconcerting is how much power this gave to government actors.  Also strangely suspicious was the universal global ban on such a minor thing as a mild plant with thousands of uses.The latter seems like a camel’s nose under the tent, a slippery slope, and is the oddest (and unnoticed) thing.Yeah, as teapartydoc said, “it’s the weed.”Without that doorstop, our poor Zman might never have had libertarians to hang.And please, by all our gods please, don’t get all anal and start with the endless boring go-around on “drugs”.  I’m talking about the loss of even the most intimate privacy in favor of chasing a phantom menace.  No, actually, I ponder the eager embrace.  And global nature!

            Alzaebo:  “Those of us with a libertarian mindset couldn’t understand why conservatives eagerly embraced the drug testing racket, which came from the drug war racket.”Answer:  Because we don’t want to live around people whose major focus in life is getting high.  We want to exclude people for whom drugs is the focal point of their lives.One of my best friends is a successful and energetic entrepruener in Portland, OR.  He is always high but that doesn’t seem to impact his effectiveness.However, drug legalization is his big issue.  He wants people to be able to get high all the time without consequence.  He doesn’t realize what an outlier he is.I offer Portland, OR as an example of the outcome of his beliefs.  I love the guy but I do not want to live in any municipality where he can vote or exert influence.

                Line:  I wasn’t going to reply to Alzaebo, but I feel compelled to support your stance.  I am no libertarian, and I come down wholeheartedly on neither side with regard to drugs and legalization – haven’t figured out precisely where I stand on the issue.  What I would emphasize, however, is that there will always be a certain percentage of people, regardless of race, who just cannot handle the responsibility of their own lives.  Whether we like it or not, they need someone to be daddy and control their worst impulses.  Not because these impulses destroy these individuals, but because of the second and third degree effects and consequences on their community.No man is an island, etc., and while I would ordinarily tell people to do what they want in the privacy of their own lives, that’s not how it works in the real world.  We’ve seen this regarding sexual licentiousness and the effect on families, and the same goes for drugs or any issue or substance that has negative effects that spill over to others.  Again, I don’t have the answer or support any one particular policy, and I don’t trust the government to do anything right, but neither do I fully trust most individuals to possess common sense or even a modicum of intelligence.

By the side of the road, as the passengers watched, they shot the kneeling boys in the back of the head.  Conservatives calling into the show were cheering this.  What the eff?

                        If the harshness of the punishment reduced crime, then we’d have the death penalty for diving infractions and everything else we criminalize.
Back in the days of merry old England, there were something like 100 or so crimes that earned capital punishment—like pickpocketing.  Even so, public hangings brought out the pickpockets who had a field day circulating among the gawking crowd.

                    I will think about your point.  Life is tradeoffs and choosing the least bad option.
The way I interpret what you are saying:  Suppose that we have two or countries that are comparable and one of legalizes drugs and one criminalizes drugs.
I am sure that the one that legalizes drugs will have more crime, homelessness, and leftism.  You are saying that the one that criminalizes drugs will have worse problems.

                        Thank you for thinking about my point.No, I am not arguing as you construe; however, let me address your point and assume that we have two comparable countries, one which legalizes drugs and one which criminalizes drugs.It is entirely conceivable / possible that the country that criminalizes drugs will have less homelessness, less crime, less social dysfunction, fewer feral negroes, fewer George Floyds, fewer Karens, fewer Kens, fewer Stasi, fewer feds, fewer know thy customer laws and regulations, fewer Pavlik Morozovs, a much lower percentage of its productivity siphoned off for corruption, make work, and unproductive purposes, and more privacy and a morally superior populace.Its just not probable.  More likely, the costs inherent in maintaining what inevitably would transmogrify into a WOD would be greater than those incurred in a live and let live society.Ask yourself:  How could a WOD regime exist withouta DEA?Secret police?Pre-employment drug screening?On-going employment screening? Checkpoints, arbitrary searches and seizures?An incessant see something, say something propaganda blitz?A general disdain for privacy and contempt for the sanctity of a man’s home?A TSA to grab, grope, prod, and poke?Mandatory evictions for public housing tenants who possess drugs?A humongous prison system stocked with patronage payola?Drug testing companies?M-Wraps?More and more SWAT?More and more veneration of AGWs?More snooping of finances?Organized crime?Black markets?The above is just off the top of my head.  The WOD has given us all of that at a tremendous cost to WHITE PEOPLE. Just think of all of the capital, human and otherwise, that has been sacrificed at the altar of this suicidal objectiveThe utopia is thinking that we can eradicate drug use.Thus, a country that criminalizes all drug use, is going to have to launch a WOD. Its inevitably is inextricably linked to its totalitarian ends.  It necessarily will have to upend civil norms long a hallmark of the west.Conversely, a society that adopts a laissez faire approach to drugs would not be required to suffer a spectacular misallocation of resources occasioned by a WOD.  To be sure, there might be more drug use and its concomitant external costs, but such costs would be far more sufferable.

                Let me rewrite this a bit.“I want people to be able to stay drunk all the time without consequence.”and“I don’t think alcohol as such should be made illegal while public drunkenness and doing potentially dangerous things like driving while drunk should be illegal but not punished in particularly draconian ways”are not the same thing. The latter is my position as you might guess. I used to live in Portland and now still live in the suburbs of it. It’s an odd case because the general culture here attracts lowlifes and hedonists from the entire country and weed was de facto legal years before it was de jure legal.Portlanders don’t favor legal weed out of any belief in freedom but because for years it was one of the few places in the country where you walk down the street smoking weed and not get arrested. Fun fact: on a recent (undesired) trip into town I was usually the only person on the streetcorners without a mask. The little P-town fruitcakes gawked at me like I had horns. Most Portlanders are not any kind of libertarians, just commies who like to get high. That’s why they’re all in on masks, vaxxing, and persecuting the unvaxxed. I fully understand Z’s hatred of self-described libertarians though, and his categorization of them as Leftists. This is what the majority turned out to be. Trump (and later the Covid panic) was a kind of UV light that made them glow bright commie red.There tend to be two main varieties of libertarians actually. The dont-touch-muh-weed kind and the dont-touch-muh-shekels kind. Neither really cares about privacy and both are fine with totalitarianism as long as it leaves them with whatever little bauble they think they’ll get to keep when the stormtroopers roll in.

        If our leaders were actually worried about conspiracy theories, they would at a minimum, stop spreading them.  They would also stop selling their trust.As the managerial class tells obvious lies as being the gospel truth, the public’s trust in them collapses.Everyone knows what happens when you get caught in a lie. Your friends and family don’t just not believe the lie they caught you telling, they stop believing you in general. Everything you say becomes suspect.The rise of the “conspiracy theory” is a symptom of the lack of trust in the authorities.

        A problem, where I sit and consider the flagrant violations of Americans’ 4th Amendment Rights is the imbalance of it all.The State, including its “private industry” tech allies invades your privacy in unlawful and unethical ways. You have no privacy.You, on the other hand, are forced to deal with impersonal, unidentified and thus private invaders that use bland emails to inform you that you have been censored, deplatformed for some thought you revealed, words you ‘posted’. And before someone says that the victim made it public, we have a snitch society where children publicly denounce their parents and where the ‘government’ routinely ignores FOIA requests or ‘redacts’ any useful information.One possible solution can involve the same technology used by the transgressors, with a hint from Solzhenitysn. What is that ‘anonymous’ sender of your ‘notice’ or ‘warning’ from some tech geek behind the scenes instead had a name and title and other identifying information. Do you think said noodle-armed geek would be so bold? Cannot the same technology that is used to violate you be used for this purpose?When the oppressors can have the curtain pulled back, and experience fear each time they hit ‘Send’ to threaten you … the balance may shift.

            MisterRogers:  Look at the oppressors in Australia. All those cops beating up White protesters have families and neighbors.  Someone knows their names and address.  Yet zero pushback and zero consequences.  I mean personal consequences.  And I expect a number of people here to cavil at attacking the cops’  ‘innocent’ families, when they will not cavil at arresting you for trying to prevent the forcible vaccination of your children.One side has made it totally personal, no holds barred.  It’s not merely the dissident who is banned from various online and real-life activities.  They have gone after people’s children and their parents.  One blogger I used to read quit because he had been doxxed and the left had gone after his young nieces and nephews.  But even those on the DR claim we can’t ‘stoop to their level.’  Until we are willing to fight with no holds barred, we will continue to lose.  All morality will have to be situational (and racial)  until after we win.

                “Someone knows their names and address.”Yes, but when ‘everyone’ knows their names and addresses, things may be different in terms of the parameter mentioned by Solzhenitsyn. Perhaps not, look at the case of Ms. Babbitt’s murderer. He is not dead yet.When they, the oppressors lay their heads down at night and have to worry about every little crackling twig outside their home, then that which was absent in St. Petersburg during the Soviet terror may be tested in terms of its effects. Perhaps the dissident was not correct, and his mention of the common complaint ‘in the gulags’ was moot?Even if every third enforcer was blown to kingdom come, nothing would have changed. However, based on the frenzied actions and re-actions of our ruling class in the imperial capitol, it seems they fear that which Solzhenitsyn mentioned was the missing aspect to a 70 year reign of terror in the former USSR.From J. Edgar Hoover on the apparatus of invading privacy seems to be all about fear on the part of an illegitimate ruling class as it has set about strip-mining and selling out the country of their birth.

                    MisterRogers:  Yes, I agree the residents of the imperial capitol appear to fear what I advise.  Whether or not such actions actually materialize remains to be seen.
Please don’t label Ms. Babbitt’s boyfriend as her ‘murderer’ so soon, when he has yet to have any trial or hearing.  And, from what I’ve read of Ms. ‘free-spirit’ with OCD who liked to slap and scratch him when he told her to calm down, I’m even less inclined to immediately assume deliberate harm on his end.

                You are absolutely right. I once thought it was poignant that Americans believed the rule of law still exists and there is equal application of the law. Such naivete now infuriates me. The hour is too late to indulge nonsense.Being unfair and ruthless are minor in comparison to what we will have to do and be to endure and eventually prevail. It is not pleasant now and will become worse in the  near future. I sometimes question whether I have the wherewithal and know many who do not. Many do, fortunately, and I believe that includes me. It started unfairly so there’s no need to worry about rules.

            There is something to be said for, I believe the legal term is “self-help” even if the actions aren’t always legal 😀 Down here in FL, the young man who is a suspect in his GF’s disappearance while camping in WY (now murder: they found her body), had mysteriously gone missing. Perhaps he’s skipped town, but I can think of other reasons he may have vanished.

        Tying in the Taki article subject to this one, the loss of privacy and the open adoption of newspeak as the official form of communication from cloud to dirt people are conclusive indicators in and of themselves that there is a moral imperative to oppose and attempt to destroy the regime that has imposed these conditions. It is a very different proposition to imagine an invigorated movement animated by moral certainly of its own righteousness and the fundamental evil of the adversary. The increasingly authoritarian character of the regime indicates their genuine fear of such a movement. Even if it doesn’t really exist yet it ought to and they are prepared to punish any dissent as if it were expressed by an opposition that mirrored their own moral certainly and was acting accordingly rather than what we actually have which is a feeble opposition motivated primarily by logic and reasoning about optimization of various economic variables.

        Privacy as a a modern concept expanded with the security of private property.  It rose in tandem with our rise from serfdom.   This is one of the reasons the Covidian religion is so dangerous.  Your own body is the most private of all your property.  If a Covidian can tell you to mask your face…the most important part of your most private property, and they can tell you that you have no choice but to inject a fluid into your body that they chose for you, because its good for you, then ALL private property is in danger, and thus all privacy is in danger.  Suddenly, last week, by fiat, the IRS can now see every transaction you make above $600.  And one day, the holy grail of what they want, a state sponsored digital currency, will show them every purchase you make, in real time.  Although I’m sure Congress and certain executives will have a “privacy shield” for their transactions. You’ll have to apply for one, they won’t just give it to you.  Hunter Biden will get the first one.

        According to the Bible, the first thing man did when he became self-aware was cover himself.
Not ‘became self-aware,’ but ‘aware of his sin.’
The latter clarifies and reinforces the foregoing text in your essay.  Shame follows sin.  Total transparence reveals sin, thus the desire for ‘privacy.’

            I always treat Z’s commentary on Christianity with a grain of salt. Love his confidence thought! “This is what this means!”
Yes, and the story of Adam and Eve wasn’t created, it was related. God told Moses how things were, and Moses wrote them down.
I’m also not so fond of the hunter gatherer story. I guess you could say, IT was created in order to include an evolutionary spin on early civilizations.
I don’t believe in it.

            “Shame follows sin”.  Yes, it should, but as for the reprobate mind – it is an ‘inventor of evil things’.  Shame is not in the vocabulary.And in reference to the Taki article – that’s why logical, moral arguments fall on deaf ears.

        One other thing that is heretical (staggeringly so) in modern society:Deep creative thought requires privacy. Without allowing private time to think, there is no new genesis of ideas or trial of concepts. Creativity requires trial and error. Lots of error. Regardless of anyone’s intentions, error is punished in public, and trials are frowned upon. *Origination in general* is frowned upon.Creativity is an individual activity. People can come together afterwards to collect what has been created, but they can’t do the actual thinking in a boardroom in front of a committee.Look at things designed by “benevolent dictators”, like Kelly Johnson and contrast with anything “designed by committee”.

A creative civilization is one where they demand the opposite answer to “are you a team player?”, or wouldn’t even think to ask the question.

        Great column.It is not hard to see how privacy was an asset for people living in relatively close proximity in small villages.A very scarce asset.The village I once lived in very much resembled the dystopia you describe in the first paragraph. And we’re not just talking about reading minds here, the whole village would divine your thoughts days before you even thought them, and you had a pretty good idea about what was going on in the bedrooms.I’ve had villagers tell me “Fie! I heard you effed so-and-so during your stay in Copenhagen” – finding out stuff from a thousand miles away that not even my friends knew. Privacy is the main reason I prefer to live in a city, and living in a village certainly made me wary of compromising my online anonymity.

            It is an interesting paradox. In a small town, they say there are no secrets, but that’s really just the result of knowing people. Urban life is the illusion of privacy, because you will have very few, if any, close relationships. Loneliness is conflated with privacy and anonymity.

                Perhaps.I’ve only known one village and there, it was certainly more than just knowing people on a personal level; they found out things about you that not even your closest friends or family would know.You had to be careful what you told a doctor. He wouldn’t report to the whole village of course, only your enemies.If you were pulled over by the police everybody knew the same day.Alcohol sale was circumscribed: you were on a rationing card and had to order everything shipped up from Denmark; if you had booze in your house, half the village would invite themselves to a party, because the post office workers had told them the hot news.I don’t know how much was specific to the Faroese culture, and how much was universal for village life. Back then, I ascribed it to their busybody Lutheranism but I’ve been told it’s much the same all villages over.There are a lot of upsides to living in a village, but there are serious downsides too. I’d advise people looking for a white bolt hole or community to make a dry run: move to the nearest village for a year or so, while you’re looking for the perfect spot for your bunker, see if village life agrees with you at all.

If your pastime is reading books, discussing arcane topics or their 21st century equivalents, it’s a great way to keep the commoners at bay as garlic reportedly is to keep vampires away 😀

            Villages are for raising a family, where protecting one’s children and being able to keep tabs on local institutions like the schools outweigh the want for privacy.  There’s a reason most singles don’t tend to stay in the village they grew up in until they get married and move back after the first kid.

            I heard you effed so-and-so during your stay… Privacy is the main reason I prefer to live in a city…
I.e. easy access to anonymous no-consequences fornication with hypergamous roasties [soon to become embittered empty-souled post-menopausal cat ladies].
And you wonder why The Village [with its gossip] has vastly higher total fertility rates than does The City [with its devil-may-care nihilism].

                Yep, when I moved to a small town years ago (unfortunately I have since left) it instantly put an end to my career of promiscuity. I had a friend who didn’t change his habits when he lived there and didn’t last more than a year.

            I find there’s a degree of that in the small towns around me. I live about a quarter mile outside the thing that could most charitably considered a village. It has two churches, two cemeteries and the township garage and voting house. There are many more dead people in the village than live people. It’s not incorporated, so it has no mayor, just the township trustees that manage the 4-mile x 4-mile township I live in. Any of you in urban or even suburban areas have more people on your block than we have in that 16 square mile area.But still, I find people I hardly even know who know surprising details about my life and business. If you tell one person something, pretty soon everyone else knows it. And through a very extensive grapevine, yes, like Felix says, stuff that happened miles away can make it back.I suppose it’s unnerving for urban people, but I don’t mind it that much. It’s helped me a time or two. When a trailer on my property was burglarized, the grapevine provided me with the identities of the burglars before the sheriff even had a chance to come investigate. It was a couple local ne’er-do-wells who were the usual subjects for most trouble in the area — and I got a lot of my stuff back via, ahem, local justice.It’s been used against me at least once — I pissed off some neighbor, still don’t know who, and they called into the sheriff with some false claims that had just enough basis in truth to make life difficult. Of course, this was in a time and place where I could and did simply tell the sheriff to get the hell off my property unless he had a warrant (They never got one. Case closed.)The stuff they knew was extremely private and they had the specifics so very wrong that I can only assume it was passed modified through the grapevine.But it’s the price you pay for the fact that if trouble ever shows up on my doorstep, there are rough men who aren’t strangers to fistfights who will come at a minute’s notice to help me. You can’t be friends with everyone — small towns are like real life soap operas — but cultivating those relationships and friendships is how you survive in tough times.

Yes.
I didn’t want to discourage people, but as LITS says above, there are a lot of romantic notions going around. You pay a price if you want to have a real community because if it doesn’t cost you anything, it won’t be worth anything.

                Vizzini:  Thank you for the words of wisdom and advice.  The land we’ve bought lies just outside a similar, unincorporated town – more accurately called a hamlet –  with very few people nearby.  The largest town within a 50 mile radius is just over 12,000 people.  We’ve already tried to move carefully and courteously in our relations with our local real estate agent, bank loan officer, title company contact, etc.    The first impression you make is important but in really small towns, so are all subsequent ones.

                Ah, small town life. My boss called me into the office because I was using one of the two local bars as my living room three nights a week. But the manager of the one supermarket used fo open a new check-out lane because I was a man who wore a suit six days a week. I once had a stranger apologize to me for unwittingly asking my girlfriend to dance while I was singing karaoke (ironically, her fave, Joe Diffie’s “Pickup Man”).  Everybody knows your business; and you know exactly who your friends and your enemies are. I found it clarifying, but taxing; so I moved away to a larger city after a few years. One drawback was realizing that while locals may have respected me, they’d never consider me one of them. That was reserved for the multigenerational folks, whose civic “history” included the deeds of their parents and grandparents and the prospects of their children, real or notional. Your pedigree was as important as that of any one of the stock at the annual bull sale.

                        Another consideration of rural living is health care, especially if you getting long of tooth.  I found a place that had a medical school 15 yrs back in the mountains of ETenn.  Huntington WVa also has a medical school.  Prior to the opening of these VA-associated med schools that cater to rural populations the regional health care was 3rd world.  Small towns are often tolerant of eccentricities, I’ve found.  I’ve also been amazed at the general lack of cognitive stratification that i found when in the cities.  I’ve been in relative backwood shacks where i was surprised to find well-worn libraries with dense philosophy and economic tomes.  Certainly rare but you find the top 5% sprinkled in with the general pop.

                    I’d always lived in Cities- Liverpool, London, New York. As a kid it was village like but condensed, You knew a lot about all the kids at school and their families. As an adult, the village was the office and you had the friends and foes things and intimate knowledge  of many characteristics but little (other than really close friends) of family.The move to the boonies came at an age when location was the only commonality with most neighbors so with a couple of exceptions acquaintances rather than friends. That’s probably a guy thing, the wife know more about the women than I know about her.

        Comment about low-trust societies. Primitive societies are highly tribal. Whether it’s the inbred family clan in Afghanistan (hey, that rhymes!) or the few extended families that comprise a village (or city slum) in Africa, these are adaptations to primitive conditions. They have benefits, otherwise they wouldn’t exist. But they make anything resembling Western European standards of living impossible. Consider the difficulty of making business transactions when you have little reason to trust a stranger. Or, even if you are honest, you are bound by custom to support an extended family, even if it’s largely composed of non-productive people.

            Consider the difficulty of making business transactions when you have little reason to trust a stranger.
Or, inversely, that the guys you do business with are all your nephews and cousins so you have to offer them family rebates, hire their worthless offspring or give them a line of credit you know they’ll not be able to pay back.

            In my rural environment, there are business decisions I make that are not strictly about the economics. I may pick a guy to work on my car, or a store to deal with simply because they’re part of the local community and they’re going to be there for me in other contexts as well. In the age of the automobile it’s not that big a deal for me to drive to a nearby city for some things, and I do, but for things I do that are going to involve a continuing relationship, I’ll often pick the one that has a connection to the “tribe” of locals.

                Vizzini:  Again concur.  It’s all about creating and maintaining an intertwining network of local relationships.  You want the locals to prosper because you want your locale to prosper, and they are your neighbors.  And your waitress at the diner may well have an uncle who is the best at grading hilly driveways.  And your realtor may be dating a local cop.

                    The thing is, the uncle may not be “the best” at grading hilly driveways, but if he’s “okay” you still may want to go with him, if “the best” is from the city 50 miles away, because you want him to prosper and think well of you. That guy 50 miles away isn’t going to be available when your car is stuck in the snow out in the middle of nowhere some night, but the uncle with the big dump truck and dozer is also the uncle with a big 4×4 that will haul his butt out of the house in the cold at 10 p.m., pull you out of the ditch and then offer you a mug of hot coffee to boot.

        So this is where societal modeling comes into play as a useful tool of prediction. At the extremis, the extinction of privacy is predicted to lead to strong evolutionary pressures for the emergence of extreme retaliation measures. The most benign of these will be both overt &amp; covert sabotage of IT systems that sustain the EC-based intrusion of people’s privacy. But it does not stop there. As people endure severe injury via privacy invasion, they eventually react in a primal fashion and strike out against the perceived attacker, again both overtly &amp; covertly. IOW, people will start dropping dead for no clear reason, and by various mechanisms, not just getting their head blown off. Historically, it was poisoning, but our modern age will create many more novel ways to accomplish this goal. That is the end-state we are headed for. No societal trust, mass paranoia, lots of discriminate killings. And it’s very hard to remain a productive society under those conditions.

            Interesting. ” The most benign of these will be both overt &amp; covert sabotage of IT systems that sustain the EC-based intrusion of people’s privacy.”From a carrier/distribution perspective, think of the locations of Cell towers and fiber lines. They are everywhere around us, seemingly impossible to guard. It wouldn’t take much for modern, angry, privacy injured Luddites to shut down the information highway. Heck, most of the information highway travels beside the highway. Poles and nodes being passed 100’s if not 1000’s of times a day.I don’t believe satellite data transmission has the near the capacity of the land networks but I don’t know?

                Back when I was working in IT, early in career (1980s), I recall the half-humorous comment probably in a telecoms industry journal, that the backhoe was perhaps the major threat to the then cutting edge communication network (fiber optics). And sure enough, there was at least one such major outage that cut off some of our important circuits for a day or two, and for precisely that reason. Turns out there’s a reason for the “Call Miss Utility, Underground Cable” signs.

            Nextdoor was marketed as a nicer social media, but quickly turned into a hive of the most wretched psychopaths on the internet.  Ends up that proximity to others doesn’t make people any more civil.

                Whenever academics/activists have tried to prove that internet anonymity breeds “harassment,” “hate,” etc., they’ve found that identified people are much worse-behaved than the anonymous are. Proving themselves wrong doesn’t change their minds/goals, because [see Z’s post].Everyone who’s not insane knows that 4chan is a far friendlier place than Facebook, that the turn-of-the-century “no girls” internet was paradise compared to social-media NPD/BPD hell. But wherever censorship (and/or astroturf) is weak, the “right” (including some anti-establishment left) dominates. When Americans are allowed to speak somewhat freely, and anything like a “marketplace of ideas” emerges—or really, if you can so much as search for a text string on Google and *find it*—it takes a fake election, a color revolution, and a military coup to defeat a mere Trump.They know.

                After Trayvon, if you posted on Nextdoor a tip about a suspicious black person in your white neighborhood then you would feel the full wrath of the white liberals, especially the women.
On Nextdoor, noting the suspicious behavior of a black person was worse than being a drug dealer, burglar or rapist.

I use the presence of BLM and “We Believe” posters for the same purpose, but imagine Nextdoor is better (I refrain from all social media so cannot say this is true with certainty but believe you). Getting to Felix’s earlier about small towns, one upside is you know who your enemies are. The downside is they know who is theirs.

                    Heh. All of my rentals are in heavily black neighborhoods. Last summer you’d rarely see a BLM sign there, but  go across the interstate less than a mile to the nice wealthy white academic neighborhood north of campus and they lined the residential streets — every other yard had BLM or “Hate has no home here” or some other virtue signal.

                        Zman lives in Lagos. You own rentals in predominately black areas. I have a serious question: am I being shortsighted when I exclude the Southern towns I research purely on their demographics? I tend to “look no further” when I see &gt;15% black. I just assume that the friction increases from there. And, God forbid, they command a majority and thus control municipal politics. I grow weary of California; though, to be honest, I’m more chafed by the continuous wildfires in my region that the foolish policies of Newsom and his ilk. The economics and climate of Mississippi and Alabama intrigue me; but the high concentration of blacks muddies the water. I’d really like to hear from people in those parts.

                        No, you’re right to avoid places with high concentrations of blacks. 15% is a good upper bound. Alabama is livable only to the degree that segregation still unofficially exists (I’ve never lived there, but my Dad did in the later years of his life). It’s a culture that has a lot of years experience dealing with large numbers of blacks, but when they’re in large numbers, it’s the usual. Birmingham was once a great city. Now it’s a shithole.I have rental business in black neighborhoods, but my own rural area is pretty much exclusively White. And up in the city, it’s the usual thing — hectoring leftists preaching about diversity but living like KKK members in 90%+ White neighborhood. It’s just “for the good schools” you understand.Whites who live in my rental neighborhoods lean heavily toward those with a propensity for bad decisions and mudsharking.No White who has a choice sends their kids to the city public schools — they are just nightmarish. If people with kids feel like they  really want to live in the city, their kids go to private schools and they congregate in White neighborhoods, otherwise, they live in one of the suburbs that, frankly, dwarf the city core, and send their kids to White schools.Childless couples live in the trendy, expensive city neighborhoods, because they can virtue signal to their hearts’ content and don’t have to worry about the school system.

                        BTW, if I were you I’d look at the somewhat Whiter Northern parts of Appalachia, instead of the deep South.
Even northern Tennessee and Kentucky have some pretty White parts that still have a nice climate — mild winters, only moderately brutal summers.
More north than Southern Kentucky and you start to have to deal with real winters, but it also gets much, much Whiter.

                        Maus, the culture shock for this born Californian is jarring.  Southron whites are a league different from West Coast niceties, and blacks, though affable, tend to try to fill any space they’re in.  You won’t ‘belong’ in most places. It really is a foreign country down there.Biloxi, Mobile, Pensacola, Houston, Corpus Christi, Alexandria LA- the Salt Life coast is the closest to California sensibilities.  If you prefer mountain, look to the competitive river fishing community; find them at the boat shop, they’re a large subculture, or follow the I-24, I-26, or US 23 up. I-85 is the Richie Rich  folks.

                Your comment would make me believe that it’s an unregulated Wild West. My experience was quite the opposite.I briefly used NextDoor in my community, but soon resigned when it became evident they were a bit to censorial for my tastes (and it didn’t even directly include me.) Turns out it’s difficult to discuss topics like the precise demographics about who is committing the crimes without pushing the buttons of Shitlibs 😀Once or twice a year I get solicitations from my HOA about joining and I’ve made it clear that I refuse to participate in a chaperoned echo chamber. They can all go to hell for all I care.

                Hmm. I’ve heard a lot of mentions of Nextdoor lately. Sounds like something I’ll need to join and then lurk, observe, and make notes. Might provide some hints as to who the local snitches and Karens are.

            Whitney:  It’s not that they have no awareness of how far they have fallen – they genuinely believe they are your moral superior.  And the fact that it’s a high-end neighborhood is a big part of it.  They have a certain amount of money, hence a certain faith in their credentials and social standing and believe it is warranted, therefore they are ‘good people.’  And ‘good people’ utilize moral signifiers to demonstrate both their ‘goodness’ and their implicit superiority.  You won’t convince them otherwise or be able to shame them out of what they consider a moral stance.

            Ooooooh!  I’m so scared. Better go get the jab!! I stay as far away from “medical” care as possible anyway.  These psycho bitches are so out of control they’d deny a person life saving surgery such as an appendectomy just because said person won’t take a jab that doesn’t even prevent something that might kill .9% of old people that were probably going to die of pneumonia or something else that year anyway.  And don’t have the self-awareness to see how insanely contradictory that makes their supposed great concern for humanity.  I know these heinous old bags and despise them with every fiber of my being.I lasted 2 weeks on Next Door (mainly to keep track of news of emerging vagrant sightings wandering the neighborhood thanks to easy access from the city via the mostly useless newly installed lite rail endlessly promoted by the same jab pushing bitches). I still get email notices from it for some reason. Almost always about someone’s dog running loose in the streets dodging cars.

                My response would be to any that would deny medical care to the unvaccinated is to extend and raise the stakes.  Fat people and diabetics should also be denied care, as basically these two “illnesses” are lifestyle choices.
Please, this is a mode of ridicule or creating dissonance.  I’m not arguing the for such occur.

That’s already happening. I read recently of a case in Washington, I think, where a man was bumped down the waiting list to receive a heart transplant because he refused to take the vax.
They’d rather he die than be able to make that choice himself.

        I work at a rather large prison in central KY. The mystery jab was offered to all inmates, with the promise of being able to see their families in-person. Nope. Once they got the jab, the goal posts moved and the visiting family must have the jab too. What’s interesting is the ones that haven’t taken the jab are almost all black dudes. They simply refuse. Most don’t want to be lab rats for the government is the word I’m getting. Who can blame them?

                They are right. What a large fraction of the world’s population still has not become aware of is that they too, are subjects in the greatest scale medical experiment in world history. No, that’s not an exaggeration: the mRNA jabs, and perhaps a lesser extent the other tech, are never before trialed (except in small population) and against a class of virus that has resisted previous immunization attempts. Billions of guinea pigs, absolutely no legal recourse, and probable bad faith by actors at all levels: Big Pharma, the medical profession, government regulators and sundry rent-seekers. At the very least the scientists could be collecting reliable data upon their test subjects, but I doubt this is being done systematically. Not for the least reason, is that the last thing anybody in the power structure wants are accurate data. No, just keep the money rolling in, thank you very much. When all is said and done, the damage to our institutions, and perhaps many our ourselves, will be incalculable.

                It’s one of those cases where low-IQ beats high-IQ.
Actually I saw a statistic that showed that’s it’s the mid-IQ who are morely likely to get the jab than low-IQ and very high-IQ.
The very smart people are more likely to research the topic, and as most of us know, once you learn about this, it quickly becomes “no F-ing way!”

                    KGB beat me to it, but I was going to say it a slightly different way: In the very old days (of the Tuskegee Experiment), the government was content to lie to the Negroes and, occasionally, to everybody else, when it suited the government.Since then, it seems one thing they learnt from the experiment was that people are trusting and gullible, so they expanded the lying franchise to cover nearly all communications with everyone.Alas, the institutions have used up most of whatever credibility they had and we now are going to reap the harvest that must come when people will refuse to believe anything they say. That could create real problems, especially if a sudden need to tell the truth were to arise.For reference, consult your children bedtime story about the little boy who cried “wolf.”

                Whitney:  There was no ‘experiment’ in Tuskegee.  There were blacks infected with STDs via their own behavior, and they were not treated.  I’m not claiming it was all ethical, but it’s a misnomer to claim they were experimented on.
And they’d be the first to deny that the US government is ‘their government.’  Their refusal is the result of their distrust of White people and White medicine, period.  In this case, unfortunately, it is the stupid Whites who trust ‘their government’ and system, and so subject themselves and offer up their children to potentially deadly injections.

                    Finally, some accuracy and clarity on this “misunderstood” topic.  The Lefty progressives would have us believe this “evil” was the same as Mengele of the camps, or the Japanese 731 unit.  Nothing was further from the truth.
Also, in the early 30’s, the known treatment for syphilis was not a shot in the arm of penicillin.  It was a risky treatment regimen of increasing doses of arsenic.  There were known side effects and death from such—it is a poison after all.  Hell, even Al Capone refused treatment and died from it in 1940 or so.

                The winter “flu” season in the Northern Hemisphere will — I suspect — be very, very interesting. A lot of bubbles are going to pop.The vaxxes (I prefer that slang term, as the term “vaccine” technically doesn’t fit many of the injections;  recent Orwellian re-definition notwithstanding) DO NOT protect against infection and thus spreading the virus. At best, they provide the jabee some protection against severe illness and death — for several months, perhaps.The virus frolicking in a vaxxed population will tend to become resistant to the pretend immunity the jab confers. The new variant will likely only spread more readily in both the vaxxed and unvaxxed populations.The naturally immune MAY have the best protection against the virus — by a factor of ten or better, compared to what the vaxxes offer. Funny, you’ll rarely hear that claim in the MSM. Wonder why.Heavily vaxxed populations — the UK, Israel, etc. have quite high case counts in the summer wave, even higher than the same time last year, when 0% of their populations had been vaxxed.  There is much uncertainty in those numbers, since amount of testing and virus variants and other variables change. Statistics are adjusted to taste: a large fraction of those “cases” or even “hospitalizations” just mean a positive test. The person may have no symptom of a Covid-related illness whatsoever.In other news, civil liberties continue to erode. 🙁

                    ‘Statistics are adjusted to taste: a large fraction of those “cases” or even “hospitalizations” just mean a positive test. The person may have no symptom of a Covid-related illness whatsoever.”That’s the metric the Lovely Mrs. and I hear on the news: “Cases! Cases! Cases!”It sounds spooky until you sit down and think “What does it mean?”If 100 people test positive for COVID and 2 people really are sick and showing symptoms, 100 cases sounds scary. 98 people symptom free doesn’t sound so bad.We also push back on the cases meme by asking simply “how many people are dead from this?” If people do die, did they have any other underlying health issues that could have been worsened by the illness?If nothing else a greater bulk of people are “noticing” the disconnect between what they are personally seeing and what they are encountering in the world around them. What happens next is anyone’s guess.

                    Ben:  Yet another reason the ‘flu season’ ought to be interesting is that, according to a few things I’ve read (but have not verified) some people are claiming to have gone for the annual flu shot and instead have been given the Covid vaxx.  I stopped getting the flu shot about 5 years ago but many White people get it religiously every fall.
I expect the authorities to claim, just as they did last year, that the flu mysteriously vanished and everyone with the sniffles has Covid –  particularly children.

                        I used to sardonically bring up the sudden disappearance of deaths from heart disease, flu / pneumonia etc. in official stats and say Covid must be a miracle cure. They’ve corrected the published stats for the US to show Covid as excess deaths with the other previous leading causes more in line with previous years. Who knows if it’s all just made up but the published stats don’t look as ridiculous as they used to.

                        3g4me—worse.  Last year my State’s top medical officer touted the “absence” of recorded flu cases and connected such to the efficacy of social distancing and masking!  The implication, then plainly stated as well, was that perhaps such measures should be implemented every flu season—irrespective of Covid cases.

                        What you say is sure possible. Here in FL the drug stores already are offering both the Covid and Flu jabs. There are already formulations for both in one shot, but I don’t know if it’s deployed yet.I’ve seen the claim many times that diagnosed flu disappeared, or almost so, since the pandemic. Of course that claim is ridiculous on its face. The flu kills tens of thousands in a normal year. How many millions must it sicken? Now, it’s possible that masking, distancing and other measures reduced the flu too, but it couldn’t have eliminated it.More likely are at least two factors: it’s my understanding that the “Covid” test cannot distinguish Covid from other common viruses including the flu. That is certainly possible. But a much more plausible one is simply that Big Medicine gets more funding from the government when they have a “Covid” case — real or imagined. “Follow the money,” oldest rule in the book.As I’ve posted before, I used to get the “free” flu/pneumonia jab. However,  I am highly disinclined to take any kind of injection since, oh, about December of last year.

                    No, that’s just it.They don’t “provide some protection”.
They wipe out natural immunity.
That is, our broad-spectrum antibodies.That’s why millions ‘have no effects’; those come later, when it’s too late, when the chain of cause-and-effect is forgotten.
Pathogenic priming is an easier term to describe than ADE or viral enhancement.  That is, opening pathways to new infections, even milder ones.

                        Yep, if there’s one thing I might have thought I knew—but didn’t—it’s how much we need to have our immune system challenged on a daily basis.  It’s like a muscle which weakens through disuse.My FiL had a triple bypass some time ago.  The next day we visited him in the ICU, only to find two nurses making him sit up in bed and then stand next to it!  When questioned, they said old people deteriorate quickly when left immobile.  In three days, they tossed him out of the hospital.One can only imagine what happens to folks immunity-wise when locked in for 6 months straight.
