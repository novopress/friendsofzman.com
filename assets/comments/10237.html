        We know quite a bit about how Puerto Ricans assimilate into America (or absimilate, as John Derbyshire puts it) because they have had large enclaves in New York City for a long time now. Once their numbers reach critical mass, as they have in portions of the Boogie Down Bronx, everyone (including the hardest, most criminal blacks) flee in terror.Even American gangsters of Italian and Jewish background worked with the U.S. Government in World War II by using their waterfront connections to alert Uncle Sam about suspicious activity, but for Puerto Ricans, a cop (or any authority) is just another guy who, if you kill him, you are now the ruler of the territory where the cop previously patrolled.I saw a recent interview with Sam Dickson and Jared Taylor and Dickson said the ability to abstraction is what separates whites and Asians from black and brown peoples, which makes it plain why these countries are in chaos. That a cop’s badge represents an abstract system that maintains civilization is just something the duskier races can’t process. Force is the final recourse even in Western civilizations, but in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, it’s the first and only recourse, and it’s frankly too swift and brutal for me to want in my country. I don’t want to live in either total chaos, or in a place where decapitated heads are displayed in public squares to maintain order, so let’s try to build that wall already, or at least stop willfully destroying ourselves.

            From my NYC point of view it seems to me that PR threatfulness is purely a function of how Black the Puerto Rican is.  They’re on a continuum from Black to almost entirely White, and appear to be evenly distributed along that continuum.  (I’m ignoring the Taino-Indian component, but behavioral differences between the Tainos and Aztecs in 1500 would be worth considering.)  One obvious behavioral characteristic of Blacks is that they tend to move around in large groups.  Mostly White PRs tend move around alone or in pairs, just like Whites.

                Genetically, Puerto Ricans are 68% European, mostly Spanish and German. That does not mean all PR’s are 68% European. It just means they have a high number of white people on the island.
I’m generally fond of Puerto Ricans. I’ve known many working odd jobs as a young person. I once repossessed cars with a PR in Somerville Mass. Great guy. But we should not kid ourselves that Puerto Rico can be Boise Idaho.

                    Ladies and gentlemen,I agree with Z and with Garr. I am a white Puerto Rican, born and raised in the island. Moved away that hell hole 19 year ago. As someone mentioned in this thread, the signs were there and a few of us saw it. Garr indicated that we have a color continuum, similar to the mainland. Yes, we also behave the same way: whites try to improve, make things happen, etc., while the other end abuses the system  and cry “racist!” to everyone and everything. Some of us work hard in odd jobs until we find our niche. It is a subculture within the US: you see exactly the same people, from professionals to grifters, to dirty politicians.Z, you will be surprised where Puerto Ricans are. Although PR cannot be Boise Idaho, however, we can become “normal” in Boise. Just as Garr said: “Mostly White PRs tend move around alone or in pairs, just like Whites.”Hope this help clarify a little about our batshit counterparts down there.

            Take this any way you want, but as the child of immigrants, I understand what you mean about not being able to get abstraction. I didn’t get it, as I was always looking for certainty and specificity. I think there is cultural. In many respects, I still do.  But after having more years under my belt and adopting American culture as my primary culture, with the help of a lot of reading and also practicing law for 20 years, I can and do think in abstract terms.My point is that people should be very careful when they say that people don’t have the ability to do one thing or another. Oftentimes that can be remedied with exposure and practice.

            Police do not maintain civilization. They maintain the order of the elite.When the elite are doing a decent job, this can be a good thing since it beings greater stability and specialization of orderWhen the elite are doing a poor job and/or the laws don’t meet the needs of people in the community, police grow to be a liability.In other societies the elite never do a good job so its rational for them to distrust the police and such useful rational instincts aren’t going to change just because “White society” .In any case are police aren’t all that either, Security starts at home and with community anyway. Not that our elite want us to have kin or community.

            In parts of norther New Jersey, Puerto Ricans &amp; their even woolier cousins the Dominicans were ethnically cleansed by Mexicans and various sorts of Muslims. Palestinians, Turks, Syrians etc. In many ways, it was a major improvement, as crime rates went down and mercantile activity increased.

        The most amazing thing about “West Side Story” is that Tony could run through the streets of the west side shouting “Maria!”;  and only ONE girl answered.
I have to amend my previous statements about North Korea and/or Iran setting off Nukes in the USA.  To Washington DC, I’m adding NYC, Baltimore, Los Angleos and San Francisco to the list of American cities that (if bombed) would not necessarily result in a state of war.
A warning, nothing more.

            Sexual (ir)responsibility is just one of the many features of Latin American societies that shows why the “natural conservatives” argument about Hispanics is laughable. Reproductive responsibility is intrinsically tied to impulse control, and (as J. Philipe Rushton has shown) that’s definitely tied to race. The comic Colin Quinn used to say in Brooklyn when he was in the 2nd grade at Catholic school and the class took a field trip to the natural history museum, the Puerto Rican kids would be making out behind a woolly mammoth.

        One of the remarkable aspects of the managerial class is they don’t seem to learn much from their errors.
What I have learned from the managerial classes is that their career progression depends on never, ever, ever, under any circumstances ever, admitting you have made a mistake, were wrong, or don’t know something. This is instilled in newcomers to modern organisations right from the beginning, and the ambitious ones take note. After a few years they genuinely believe it. See alsothison the practice of surrounding yourself with sycophants and subsequently believing your own bullshit.

            I remember a movie called Head Office. Even though it was about corporate culture, much of the behavior was similar to bureaucracy. There was one guy in the movie that knew all the rules and had them numbered. Like Lesson number 55. ” Dammit, Jack, we went out there to tell them our side of the story. We didn’t go out there to tell them the truth! Lesson No.55: there are no truths, only stories.” “Lesson No. 2: Never volunteer, never confront, never talk to anyone you can possibly avoid.” “That’s no longer an issue, Jack. Don’t get involved with something that doesn’t concern you if you want to survive here at INC.” “Don’t call me “sir”. These people are gonna think I’m in charge here.” “Do you think you have what it takes up here? You mean can I play hardball? No, I mean can you kiss ass?” “Lesson No.4: the secret to survival here is never make a decision. Never? Never. The minute you do, you’re screwed.”I remember a sequence played by a stressed out Rick Moranis where he was on the phone with someone that was implying that he had made a decision and was then responsible and he said something like “I didn’t make the decision! I only agreed with the pre-decision that there would be a study to confirm the legitimacy of determining whether or not the resulting consensus could be decided upon.” Some convoluted avoidance to deflect blame. He then gets about three phone calls is a row and responds “I didn’t do it!” “I didn’t do it!” I didn’t do it!” Avoid making a decision so you can’t be blamed for it, but try to take credit if it succeeds. The American Way!

This saying is a similar rendition of a German one that I heard many, many times from relatives, especially my mother and grandmother, as a child:
Never Ask; Never Explain; Never Complain.
There was another one I heard as well:
Be Seen and Not Heard.

        Could it be Congress is one long stretched out conspiracy of treason for profit?“…The fact that both are looking a lot like bust outs is probably not a coincidence. You would think some of the people in the political class would take note, but no one will learn anything from the Puerto Rican bankruptcy. They never learn.”I think they don’t have to, they don’t care. Either they made their money on whatever skim and kickback has been going, or still is, most likely, or there is nothing worth strip mining down there.And the only way that it can be done is by committing mass treason.Take open borders. What else do you call it when the entire political, judicial, and executive class of betrayers do it?Legal?Or treason?It’s like George Soros and Antifa, not a peep to be heard from the political class.Gee, wonder why.Why is a megalomaniac like Soros even able to operate in the US, funding the kind of radical things he supports?Any guesses anybody?Congress is nothing but a long term conspiracy of treason.Seriously.Is there anything the political class does that isn’t treason when you get down to the nuts and bolts of everything they do, or do not do?

        Daniel Greenfield published an article with the same theme yesterday on how Western leaders absolutely refuse to learn anything from their mistaken alliances with Islam.
“Men and women of power and influence, who base their entire right to rule on their own intelligence and enlightenment, are not in the habit of admitting that they have been played for fools.”

        As to the Puerto Rico issue, I will take the contrarian view. Our leaders have learned well the lessons of past economic crises in an era of fiat currency. They will create from thin air the credit necessary to bail out Puerto Rico, generate a self-styled “workout” in which Puerto Rico’s bonds are exchanged for new bonds backed by the US Treasury, thereby making whole their cronies in the world of finance, and extract concessions from Puerto Rico in the process. The elites in finance and politics win, the dirt people in Puerto Rico and the US lose.The pattern was set with Brady Bonds in in 1980s and it really hasn’t changed much.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_BondsAs to the Official Right, this really comes back to your consistent theme that once they accepted all the fundamental premises of the Left, the Official Right really has nothing of consequence to say about most contentious issues. This is why much of the writing of the Official Right has been reduced to focusing on what I call the Theater of the Absurd of the modern left, whether on college campuses or in society in general. Here’s David French’s article published yesterday exposing SJW insanity:http://www.nationalreview.com/article/447419/rebecca-tuvel-controversy-campus-radicals-free-speech-social-justiceHere are a couple articles from the Powerline guys on the same general topic:http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2017/05/academic-absurdity-of-the-week-getting-squirrelly.phphttp://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2017/05/the-disgrace-at-duke.phpAll these articles are entertaining reading but largely irrelevant to any pressing problems in the real world. They give the Official Right a chance to beat their chests and draw eyeballs without taking any real risk.

        Aside from the failure of the  PR people to desire freedom and to govern themselves, there is the abject corruption that keeps the sewers running.  Where do you think people like Bill and Hill got their ideas for the Global Initiative and Haitian Relief efforts as a for instance?The PR has been a long brewing scandal that puts the Cuban episode to shame.  Crony business-politics is what keeps that country the way it is.  It is, as you say, a welfare state like California and it has been for some time.  Talk of making PR a “State” is only practical from the usual game of politicians garnering votes, but the real rub is just to follow the money.It is always about the money.  Here is one interesting article that gives good background on the issue of tax credits, the Fed Gov gives and takes away, and the repercussions, and responsibility enough to go around.https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/puerto-ricos-problems-can-often-be-traced-to-one-source-washington/2015/07/09/2cbd401e-21cd-11e5-84d5-eb37ee8eaa61_story.html?utm_term=.9e4cbfbfa096Maybe a little dated but good background nonetheless for a problem that like Greece keeps getting kicked down the road by our  oh-so-smart leaders.  There are 5 million Puerto Rican’s living in the U.S. and 3.5 on the Island itself and the number is dwindling at their situation worsens.  And guess where they are headed when they leave PR?

            Interesting summary article.  Took me back to my days in the industry when US hi tech firms actually made stuff in the US.  One of the first expedients under growing Asian profit pressure was to set up a Puerto Rican ‘screwdriver factory’.  Modules produced in the US were shipped to PR to be literally screwed together and shipped back here as finished goods.  Artful setting of transfer prices in and out had most of the the economic value-added attributed to PR instead of the US.  So the effective tax rate was single digits.  Good times_!Seriously, other than tax shenanigans, there was never any reason to make *anything* in PR that was not for local/Caribbean consumption, particularly if transportation costs were a factor.  Evidently K Street grifters were no longer needed to pass the juice along to Congress once production went to China, so the tax loophole got boarded up.But the local PR government grifters were too stupid/greedy to change anything despite being given plenty of warning.  Who gets a 10 year (?) phaseout in the tax code these days_?  And who is so stupid as to not see the manufacturing shutdown coming with 10 years of warning_?  And who is so stupid as to keep buying the bonds papering the tax revenue losses over_?My sympathy meter reads 0 and yours should too: Bond haircuts all around, I say_!

        Here is agood summaryon how stupid managerial tricks whipsawed the Puerto Rican economy and helped lead to the current crisis.
Stupid policy didn’t help with Mexico either.  NAFTA and the shortsightedmaquiladora laws(let’s build tax exempt factories within a few miles of the border so we don’t have to invest in our crappy infrastructure and let’s dump a couple of million people in broken down border towns to work in those factories) created all sorts of problems once China came on line and all those cats were out of work and easy pickings for the narcotraficantes.

        “Puerto Rico is the product of the people who populate the island”.  The money quote, right there.  Our world and country are the products of the people who populate them.  The prospects for the future look poor.Separately, as mentioned by Guest, some form of Brady Bonds will be used to bail out PR (and soon, Connecticut, California, Hawaii, and so on).  Leverage the full faith and credit.  Never mind what it will do to the fiat Dollar.  And people will scratch their heads and wonder why things such as capital investment and new hiring will continue to taper off…eating the seed corn…

            The PR financial crisis is very similar to Greece. The difference is Washington does not have to negotiate with the local rulers. We can step in, restructure the debt and force a haircut on the lenders and force restructuring of the island’s budget. The bigger issue is the pension system. That’s a problem that requires a degree of political will not seen in generations.That’s what makes some of the state problems so ominous. CalPERS is ~170 billion underfunded at the moment, meaning if contributions rise to meet outlays and the calculated return is brought into something close to reality, they are still short $170 Billion. Since none of those conditions will ever be met voluntarily, the real shortfall is probably $500 Billion over the next 30 years. Negative amortization is like the plant in Little Shop of Horrors.I did a little back of the envelope calculation on California debt and I come up with $69,000 per capita. GDP per capita is $56K. Once you break that 100% threshold, a strange new phenomenon occurs. Government services decline in order to service debt. As government services decline, the ability of the government to extract taxes from the public declines. Right now, we see an outflow of people from California. My bet is tax evasion is also up. Sound familiar?

                The “magic” of compound interest works in reverse when one is indebted.

                You are right about government services declining.  The services are declining everywhere such as libraries, park maintenance, state park maintenance and, of course, roads.  We take in about $170 billion a year in taxes into the general fund.  Then there is the ‘special fund’.  Of the $170 billion, $55 billion goes to “K-12 education” which amounts to about $9k per student per year.  No mention is made of CalPERS funding in the state budget, as near as I can tell.  The California Policy Center talks about how local governments are spending an increasing percentage of their budgets paying into CalPERS.  Newport Beach, for example, spends about 10-15% of its revenue on CalPERS.State finances are a wonder of obfuscation.  VOters don’t seem to ask many questions.  They just pass the next tax hike on the rich and the next bond measure.Where did you get your data on CalPERS underfunding?Regarding tax evasion, of course!  The illegals declare none of the cash from their under-the-table jobs.  I don’t see how any small business owner can stay in business by being honest with the Franchise Tax Board.  Still, state tax revenues are enormous.  The politicians are very arrogant because of how much money the state takes in taxes.

        The cloud inhabitants know that the Ponzi scheme will crash and burn eventually, but like any addict, only the next fix matters. Puerto Rico will soon hit bottom (provided the DC enablers don’t meddle) and then they will have no choice but to reform or die. On the bright side, their bottom will be relatively high and the associated misery relatively low. By the time Californians reach their magic moment, my guess is it will be a much lower bottom and much more misery. In that event, the latter may well envy the former.

            John Derbyshire had the best idea for Puerto Rico. Climate-wise (and pigment wise) Syrian “refugees” would certainly feel more at home there than in any of the fifty current states, so why not make progressives and conservatives happy with a compromise: send all migrants from war-torn Middle Eastern countries to Puerto Rico, in a sort of reverse Marielito boatlift. Actually, since we’re normalizing relations with Cuba, let’s send the Syrians there.

                And the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee should be hung. ‘I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey’s termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.’Republican motto–No enemies to the left.

            Saw a comment that some of Trey Gowdy’s people had committed arkicide by burying themselves alive.  If true, would that be related?
Comey has been Hillary’s coverup guy since Whitewater.  And Barkey is barking, still in business.  I guess the GOPe is still in session after all (conspiring).

        If I might be a little contrarian:
Since PR is a US Colony, anyone who wants to leave the Island and move to the US is allowed to.  Taking the situation in the best light of PR, they can’t possibly pay off their debts when their largest export is talent.
I think this is an issue for urban ghettos as well. The math, how much this contributes vs other factors, is of course impossible to calculate.  But I do think it plays a role.

        Back in 1982, Peter Grace {of the Grace Commission, where I was employed at the time}, described food stamps as “basically a Puerto Rican program.”  When I did my tour in visa hell as an FSO in Jamaica, visa shoppers would often come by after having been in Puerto Rico to try to demonstrate they were just tourists, really, and not would-be immigrants.

        “Now that the island is going bankrupt, it would make sense for the conservative cheerleaders to take stock and maybe reconsider those wonderful economic policies they were sure would fix anything.”
You need to explain exactly what conservative policies that were actually employed actually failed.  Was it the open market?  Not allowing unions for government jobs?  Limiting welfare, unemployment and other “free” stuff?  Or could it be the idea of low taxes and fewer regulations?
Perhaps you could name a few conservative policies that failed as well as those leftist policies did.  You know, like in Venezuela.

        This is a strange post (as many of your post are attacking the National Review crowd are.)You say, “The take away from the Bush years, for me at least, was that the Buckley Conservatives are yesterday men untethered from reality, so it’s time to go another way.”O.K., so what is the main subject of the post?  I’d say the problems with Hispanic immigration.  And what is the position of National Review on this subject?  Limit Hispanic immigration (Mark Krikorian writes for them for crying out loud and they were happy to publish pieces by Jason Richwine for their website:http://www.nationalreview.com/author/jason-richwineSo why the constant attack on “Buckley Conservatives”???
