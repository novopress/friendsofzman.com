        In this case, the winning side wants a deal, while the losing side demands to fight on
That is because Zalensky is not Ukrainian and the entities backing this war hate the populations of both – Russia and Ukraine.

            Khazarian mafiosi like “Zelensky” and his sugar-daddy Kolomoisky are the traditional war-mongering shekel grubbers of the cult of flea-bitten rug merchants that Jesus railed against in the gospels (aka brood of vipers).

                And they still cannot manage without the Jews: Julia Timoshenko’s father is a Jew of probably Armenian origin, and Poroshenko’s father is (was) Jewish, Poroshenko is using his mother’s last name. Ha-ha-ha.

            Rubbish. Zelensky is Ukrainian. He is the grandson of a Ukrainian Jew that joined the Red Army to fight the Germans. His Ukrainian ancestry goes a lot further back as well.
There is a lot of Rubbish floating around about the war.

                His passport states that he is “Jewish” and he has the “right of return”.
According to Times of Israel, Zelensky said that he comes from “an ordinary Soviet Jewish family.”

        The weirdest thing about this weird war is that the president’s drug addict son was paid millions by a foreign nation that subsequently got $300 billion in U.S. military and financial aid and there was not ONE PEEP about it from the media or the Left.
One can only imagine how these people would have gone apeshit if Tricia Nixon had been put on the South Vietnamese payroll just before Dick announced more military aid…

            Zman wrote a great piece the other day about the return of Realpolitik and the end of moralism in policy. I’d say this qualifies. All the Warmongers were crowing about how our money has hurt Russia, never mind all the death and the gross immorality of perpetuating a dangerous, unwinnable proxy war with a nuclear power. So if there is a silver lining, it’s that morality has been chucked out the window. Realism can easily tilt back to peace if it’s more profitable because we have no clearly have no moral compass here.

        So, to recap, two guys who have lost two elections (Macron and Starmer) back a guy who refuses to hold an election (Zelensky) to keep fighting while Trump’s (actually elected) peace efforts are ignored in favor of the war cries of the EU leadership (who are unelected). They want to fight with no army and no money, but just overturned an actual election in Romania won by a peace candidate. Meanwhile the Italian lady said we should extend NATO protection to Ukraine, but not with Italian troops. And the newly-elected German Chancellor wants to spend 400B Euro rebuilding the Wehrmacht to threaten Russia while the rest of Europe applauds.Watching all this, no doubt bemused, is Putin, who isn’t sure if anybody who signs this “agreement” will be in office in 4 years or if it’s worth the paper it’s printed on.

            More or less correct except that that loser and p.o.s., Starmer did win an election because his opposition was even more detested than him. The Brits are not given much of a choice.

                Kind of like Mitt Romney vs Barrack Obama.  Either way, you lose.Representative “Democracy” only works when the ruling elite fear the population.  Right now, the ruling elite hate the population, largely because they fear the invader population.  But there are a lot more Brits than foreigners.

            Great point about Putin. He not only doesn’t trust anyone from the West, he knows that our precious democracy means that any deal signed, even one with honest intentions, will not outlast the next “election.” He must move forward alone and do what’s best for his people and he can since he holds all the cards right now.

            “…rebuilding the Wehrmacht to threaten Russia,..”
No, I don’t think it is Russia they want to threaten. It is their own nationalists who must be crushed, that is priority #1. The war loan people have promised billions to recast the EUNATO into the kind of cyber-totalitarian state that Ellison, Lutnick, Fink and company promise to make North America.
That means 500 million people responsible for that debt, thus the ‘need’ to collateralize national assets…same as here.  Ukraine?  Ukraine is the gateway to turn Eastern Europe into Bosnia.

            I don’t know why Putin would not be sure about any potential agreement and if it is worth the paper it won’t be printed on.  I don’t think anything is more sure than the West will not honor any deal it signs today.  The Minsk deals were hammered out and signed by everyone, yet here we are.
Clownworld will honor the deal as long as there is a good benefit in doing so.  The moment things change and honoring the deal is no longer advantageous, they will break it.

            You forgot Donald Tusk of Poland who wants to double the size of the Polish army using universal male conscription, making it the biggest army in Europe (outside Russia), and acquire nuclear weapons.
Donald Tusk was elected, but one wonders whether a partitioned Poland (from about 1793 to 1919) was an altogether bad idea.

            Georgescu in Romania is a Zionist, not a nationalist, and his ally, professional mercenary Horatiu Potra, actually did attempt some kind of Direct Action. Both persons then lied to authorities about having an association. Potra’s men were shut down early so it’s hard to say what exactly they would have done……meanwhile, Georgescu has promised to move Romania’s embassy to Jerusalem and host a Netanyahu visit in open defiance of ICC warrants. That’s not what nationalists do. Potra was once head of security to the Emir of Qatar and did much work protecting Rothschild mining interests in Africa.Romania has been having an organized crime wave over the last few years, no doubt fueled by its bordering Ukraine, so Georgescu is more correctly viewed as a ZOG agent menacing the money train of his patron’s rivals, than a nationalist who only wants the best for his people.

            This, Putin wants a deal that recognizes Russia as the winner of the conflict, the rightful owner of the eastern provinces they captured and Crimea, and Ukraine as a helpless rump state. But we all know that before the ink is dry, the people who engineered this war will be scheming and soon enough you will see the media saying that America can’t tell a country what to do and what alliances it wants to join. Of course this is totally lolworthy but the elites eat this junk up…

            Agree about the Russians, but I think Trump is absolutely prepared to recognize all the Oblasts that voted to join the RF. He correctly wants out. (There’s not 3 Americans in a hundred who understand all the ethnic/Russophone nuances involved.) In the end, I think the Azov types can accept this because those oblasts are Russian and everyone understands this. Getting a legitimate Ukrainian president to say all this publicly is a problem. And the EU types would have to admit they made a huge mistake with Minsk II. This is always the problem with war – aims change, sunk costs prevent rational behavior.

            Yes. At this time a push to the East Bank of the Dnieper River looks all but certain. After that about 50/50 as to whether the Russians take Odessa by force as well. That probably goes for Kiev too.
Trump won’t like that but the Russians have not agreed to negotiate an end to the war. The talks with the U.S. are all concerning other matters. The Russians have made clear they will not talk about ending the war until their objectives are met. They have no reason to trust Trump or the West in general.

I think you are essentially correct.
There is no zone of potential agreement between the US and Russia, so there will be no peace.
Odessa is a tricky element. Putin may not want to take it, but he needs to. The problem is that taking Odessa substantially raises the odds of direct US intervention.

                I do hope not, but what is Trump up to? He’s all over the map with this crisis–and it *is* a crisis. Is he playing the now-famous 4D chess? Or is he surrounded by lunatic lying neocon John-Boltons-in-disguise? Or is he simply out of his depth and in way over his head? Or what? The latest that I have read is that he is “really close” to letting the Ukraine have access again to Skylink to guide their missiles. It doesn’t seem to make any sense. But direct US intervention would be a disaster of incalculable proportions. Maybe even the end of the world. The Russians’ positions are crystal clear. Will “Little Marco” save us?

It’s a lot of flim-flam bullshittery with two objectives: (1) run out the clock so Russia IMPOSES a permanent solution [and any solution that reestablishes Russian security is good for us, because we want PEACE with white Christian nuclear power] and (2) do so in a way that avoids blame, especially from his jewish stakeholders like widow-Adelson.The stupid peasant jew Zelensky is the designated holder of the bag of excrement, in the same way that Biden was before he became too mentally incapacitated for it to be even remotely plausible anymore. He may be stupid, but he is stupid and obscenely rich, if he can stay alive to spend the loot obtained by generating a million white corpses.

        I’m sure the European Girlboss Club would prefer the Girlboss, but that depends on how that little poisonous CIA dwarf gets removed from the board.If the Uke generals pull off a 1943 style deposition of Mussolini, keeping him alive as a bargaining chip to negotiate their way out of a losing war, or if they do him like Diem in 1963. Of course, that might not happen if the Uke Army finally mutinies like the German Army did in 1918, and the lower ranks simply rebel and the generals lose control of the troops. Because if there’s one fact that should be incandescently clear to the average Uke by now, it is thatalltheir leaders are all fools, idiots, foreign puppets and vultures who grow rich on their blood.It would be supremely ironic if a Ukrainian lance corporal starts building a party in the aftermath of all this. How do you say “Dolchstoss” in Ukrainian?

        Any replacement for Zelenskyy must be acceptable to Russia, and Timoshenko is not. There are also the issues of denazification, demilitarization, and neutrality.
The US and EU still refuse to listen to what Russia is saying. They still think they can impose a peace treaty on Russia.

        “A major challenge to finding a replacement for Zelensky is Europe. The scheming ladies of Brussels view Zelensky as an essential part of their scheme to turn the EU into a replacement for NATO. This is why they are offering him unconditional support for his efforts to scuttle any peace deal with Russia. Then you have individual leaders like Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, who are trying hard to make Zelensky seem like the most honest man in Europe.”The Europeans present a pathetic sight. From 2021 to 2024 they were posturing and preening as “world leaders” but Trump has cut them down to size. Now they have a chip on their shoulder and are talking about an independent defense and independent foreign policy. Which of course is destined to come a cropper. This game can only be played by the big boys — USA, Russia, and China. Trump, Putin, and Xi know this and Trump hasn’t the time or patience to soothe or flatter the egos of these inconsequential runts. Watching these runts talk about an independent defense costing several hundred billion euros (which they emphatically don’t have) is like watching a sick and emaciated 90-pound man trying to bench press 350 pounds.

            Whether the mewling runts are capable of it or not, nothing would make me happier than to see them go their own way and attempt to forge their own Ukraine/Russia policy.

            Well put. If we have learned anything from this war, it’s that you cannot defeat a modern adversary without space-based ISR. The money the Euros are talking about so far doesn’t even approach the table stakes for modern ISR, air force, hypersonic missiles etc. It’s a fugazy. Meanwhile, the UK cannot even recruit troops. Why join the French Foreign Legion when you can just take a boat across the Channel and get welfare in the Uk?

                That depends on what you mean by “defeat.” Multiple parties have shown that it’s possible to outlast the GAE without “high tech.” Maybe that’s all Russia has really been trying to do, militarily, for a while now. Although they aren’t invincible qualities (see Assad), determination and will are still the most important military attributes.

            Europe’s muppet rulers have so many big plans for themselves. Let’s see, they’re going to build their own Murrica-lite war machine, presumably cutting their welfare state down to Alabama levels to do it. They’re also going to rebuild the industry needed to power that war machine using only solar power, wind farms, and girlboss gynomagick.Perhaps they think theyareAmerica and their plan is to just do what we would and print the money for all of this. That way everyone, including half the populations of Africa and the ME, can still get their welfare checks and free healthcare while they increase military spending by an order of magnitude. Not sure how the green energy constraints can be dealt with this way though since you can’t just print BTUs.At this point their “plans” are so remote from the real world that one wonders why they don’t just declare Ukraine to have won the war. It’s no more ridiculous than the stuff Communist governments used to announce: Comrades! I’m very pleased to report that wehave won a glorious victory in Ukraine and driven the Russians back to Moscow! We have also met and exceeded the production targets in the Five Year Plan in only 2 years!

This is true. We do not and I don’t think we have in my entire lifetime. The owners were smart enough to let us pretend until the Cold War ended and they didn’t need our service anymore. However, the list is very short, of European peoples (anywhere on Earth) who are not governed by a collaborator administrative class that is ultimately directed by transnational finance through fake democracy. We are all on the sinking ship, together.

        Any peace deal is going to be fraught with all sorts of complications.  The US and Euro war-mongering jackoffs, such as cue ball Kelly, are all yammering about Trump’s betrayal and stabbing poor Ukraine in the back, yada, yada, yada. Hey, as long as it’s not their fellow citizens getting ground up, let’s keep the party going – on our dollars of course.  F all of them.

        I don’t see how anyone can get behind this mineral deal, assuming it is even real, which is questionable(I’ve read all these minerials are in the Russian occupied areas).  The American taxpayer hands out hundreds of billions of Dollars while some fake “American” (in name only) mining companies get all the benefits.  It just underlines the corruption of “America”  Meanwhile, it is near impossible to start a new mine in the US.  Two new large lithium deposits have been found in the US over the last year or 2 (IIRC, one in New England and one down near Texas) which will likely remain safe in the ground.Americans will not benefit in any way from any supposed mineral deal.

            Another huge lithium strike on the Idaho border, touted as one of the largest in the world, along with California’s Salton Sea (the desert side of Palm Springs.) Greens think “green” means pit mines the size of Ohio.

                The minerals could be laying on the ground in nice pure chunks and it would still not be financially viable to do that “mining” (picking stuff off the ground) in the US.  I’m pretty sure the only mines in the US are long term ones which were already in operation when all the regulation got passed.

        The only adults in the room when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine are the Russians. They would be wise to stay the course and finish the job, regardless of other actions by other players. Win the war, dictate the terms of peace, keep the parts that are historically Russian, and let Poland deal with the Nazis in Western Ukraine. When the smoke clears, Russia will engage in fair business deals with the US and Europe; but these won’t be exploitation deals, so the EU central banks are screwed.

            I think “let Poland deal with the Nazis in Western Ukraine” is an extremely viable solution. Basically, let Poland and Russia carve up the Ukraine’s sides, that way both get something for their trouble, and get the US out.Polak nationalists are as scrappy as Gallicians, so I think they’d come to terms rather quickly.

            If Ukrainians were smart, they would voluntarily join Russia, as historically was the case for over 300 years until 1991. But the low IQ combined with low self esteem does not let them proceed in the only right direction.Since 1991 they lost 99% of their industries. According to their comments I follow they still do not understand how it happened. They had a thriving industrial country while the Jews and Russians were around.

        Can’t have ultra-nationalists! Have to have a counterpart to the PM of Mexico, the President of Argentina, the mayor of Florence and own a revolving door at the head seat in Kiev and on and on and on and on.On the one hand it is strange that the side that is getting ground down and is heading toward a rout would insist on not pursuing peace. On the other, when the leader is not of the people getting crushed and nor are the leader’s benefactors, it isn’t surprising. When any of them can escape for any number of penthouses spread across the Rivieras in globalist metroplexes, then you have that factor as well.You would think that some day and some day soon that every nation these people flee to for refuge in gilded towers would say no more. No. You can’t come here after you make a mess of the place you ran as an outsider. No you can’t come here since here is destroyed while your own little here is flourishing and thriving and expanding. We built you a country and are even going to pay for your own domestically domiciled Riviera. All while we were destroyed and opened up for international predation.You would think somebody would have the spine to finally say, “Talk to the hand!”On a side note, this article prompted me to look up why every pundit had to suddenly switch to using Kyiv instead of Kiev. Wiki has a bit on the international campaign to erase the Russian derived Kiev. Of course the power player behind it was not Ukraine, but the US. While Ukraine has suffered this brutal shellacking being ruled over by a clown whose shtick is to play the piano with his dick and dress up in Satanic bondage a-go-go outfits they have succeeded in getting the world under the GAE to switch to use Kyiv. What an amazing thing to hang your hat on.GAE Race Communism couldn’t win a proxy war, but it could force everyone to change the spelling and pronunciation of the capital of its satrapy that is getting savaged by war.Perfectly fitting for this dying Longhouse regime. And now the glowing fingers of the rose colored dawn wave their warm welcome to the Age of The Vengeful Son.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KyivNotKiev

            About those penthouses, I had long wondered why Hitler overextended himself rather than solely fortifying the former Holy Roman Empire (Germany, Austro-Hungary, Czechia, some Baltic fiefs like Estonia.)
I hadn’t realized the role of the American industrialists and bankers. They basically prodded him on into overreach, promising backing, investment, and funding, just as Zelenkskyy was promised a Second Israel. The Austrian Napoleon sought to take on fallen Russia, with the same results.  Instead of Paris, the Russians marched into Berlin.

                I think Suvarov’s assertion was correct – the USSR was planning invasion and was caught off guard in a position not suited to defense when Barbarosa kicked off.  I have seen a speech by Mustache Man which, if honestly translated, states that very thing.  If true, the choice was to be overwhelmed in the East immediately by already superior Soviet force, or roll the dice and take the initiative.As we know, whatever promises might have been made to whomever, the industrial might of the US went to supplying the communists.  A vast river of trucks, planes, food, arms, etc flowed from US plants to the USSR, and we (and the world)  paid for that stupidity with decades of Cold War and relentless global communist subversion and mass murder.

                    Arguably, the wehrmacht could have waged a defensive war more successfully than they made a run at Moscow. But there wouldn’t have been any endgame to it. And eventually the west comes in the back door either way.

        The minerals deal is a trap.
The UK met with the dwarf dictator this weekend. Their plan seems to be to sell Trump on the minerals deal, as long as they provide protection for their ‘investment’, meaning US troops in Ukraine.
Of course a fake “Russian” attack on those troops will soon follow, trying to force the US into the war.
Trump should first demand that Zelensky is removed, then Putin and Trump can agree on the terms of Ukrainian surrender and present it to the new puppet installed by the UK to sign.

            Yeah, it’s a fig leaf for the peace deal. The US will have to spend more money to enforce the peace. Trump will want to show how we are getting a good mineral deal in return. Meanwhile, some company will actually have to invest real dollars in exploiting all these “mineral rights”. Good luck finding someone to do this, given the business, technical risks and the legendary crookery of Ukraine. It’s all BS. Remember all the mineral wealth of Afghanistan?

                    Rare earth minerals are not rare. They’re everywhere that people look for them. The problem is that they are nasty and dirty to dig out the ground, which is why we in the USA don’t dig it out of our ground and outsourced it to other countries. This is somehow better for Mother Gaia.
Waging endless war against a nuclear power on the other side of the earth for a bunch of rocks that are all over the American West is a really bad idea…

We were able to dine “safely” during the Coof as long as we wore our masks until they seated us and served the food. We are also going to produce electric cars that charge themselves as long as the companies that make them can get a “carbon neutral” certification.It turns out that Mother Nature is not some rigorous hard-ass who rigidly follows scientific laws.

            The fact that all the wrong people want Trump to sign the minerals deal tells me everything I need to know. The fact is, from their POV, the idea of the minerals deal is genius – Trump gets to talk about how he made a deal, he gets to talk about all the money it is going to bring in, and they (correctly) understand that it lowers the likelihood of an end to the conflict and it also ties us closer to the fortunes of the Kiev regime.There’s no way around this, for this war to end, Trump needs to turn his back on the “liberal world order” – NATO, the Eurocrats, the neocons, the khazars, everybody. It will make him the permanent villain. Of course that is the price to pay for actually putting Americans first, but this is the starkest A-B choice he’s ever dealt with in his life. There is no way to finesse this.

If you think the USA is a corrupt shithole, then brother you have never visited a corrupt shithole country. I would much rather live here. Assuming I didn’t have to live in South Chicago.
But as bad as mayor Johnson and governor Pritzker is, Chicago, Illinois is holistically better than most other places in the world. It attracts capital and tourism and college students and corrupt shitholes do not.

                The white caveat makes it sound clever, like a trick question’s been craftily answered. And it’s a thing “the left” don’t say. (The powerful don’t resort to wit). Anglo conservatives, especially American ones, are suckers for anything like that. “Israel is an outpost of the West in the Middle East,” etc. (Nerds love un-catchy slogans.)
You’d think the slight cracking open of the USAID books would cause an ad hoc revision in world corruption rankings, since apparently America fundsall the world’s lies(and anal sex). But noticing that isn’t clever. Any moron can do it.

        The lesson that God, Darwin and Murphy are trying to tell you, America – is that if you let women, and their male clowns have a say in military affairs – you will lose, regardless of how good your military is.Every single war America has fought in the last half century has been lost at home. The losses have been getting worse and worse as their power grows too. Viet Nam was bad – but a rousing victory compared to Afghanistan and the Kraine. In this latest clown show, over one million Ukes are dead. There is nothing to show for it, Russia is more powerful than ever before, entire multinational alternative markets have sprung up because no one wants to deal with us, and we are teetering on a complete financial collapse.Until we get menstrual harridans like AOC and her coloured girlfriends back in the kitchen, until we get menopausal old cankles like Pelosi and Clinton into a home… the trainwreck will continue.

            I agree. However, it isn’t happening until at least another generation or two. The biggest champion of the Girlboss model belongs to that very male dominated generation of the Boomers.

                Boomers are a good example of why “social reform” is almost always bad. There’s a time delay, even for the most insane reforms, before they take full effect. Boomers amused themselves and patted themselves on the back because they could flirt with “women’s lib” while still living in a world built and run by men. Full blown Gyno-Communism took until really right now to take full effect.

            Anecdote: a couple years ago I was reading the blog of a Russian transhumanist (can’t recall his name but he’s fairly well known). His readers, in spite of being transhumanists were pretty based and were giving him a hard time because he still had women voting in his TH utopia. His weak retort was basically that, in Russia at least, the women consistently vote for Putin’s party across the board. He thinks the reason for this is that Putin represents “stability and security” while his opponents clearly represent the globalism that nearly destroyed Russia before Putin took over.I think the lesson here is that, as long as we have to have women participating in politics, we can make sure they vote the “right” way by emphasizing that our positions represent stability, peace, and prosperity while the crazy Left’s obsession with diversity, inclusion, and equity, leads to chaos and poverty. Of course some women are never going to be reachable. Take these crazy bints for example (NSFW warning, boobs and swastikas) –https://www.zerohedge.com/political/titty-tantrum-topless-women-shriek-heil-donald-trump-heil-vladimir-putin-heil-elon-musk.

        “It will be another reminder that this part of the world produces nothing but misery for everyone around it.”There it is. The U.S. should have stayed as far away from this sh**-show as possible, and let the Euros deal with what is going on in their own back yard.Now the U.S. is getting smeared and stuck by this tar baby and even Trump is going to find it hard to extract the US without terrible optics. Ukrainian collapse will be ugly, and what if the Russians decide to push their advantage and gobble up more land that seems reasonable?I can see Trump panicking and sending aid and arms to avert a P.R. disaster. That would be a mistake, but it will take stones of steel to stay the course and let the Ukes and Euros deal with the mess they’ve made.

        My impression (from social media) is the the Euros either think Ukraine is winning or will win if they are just given more aid. With that in mind, Trump’s decision to pressure Ukraine to make peace seems like a cowardly betrayal to them rather than a piece of 𝘙𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘱𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘬. I assume that this belief is fostered by their version of our MSM, which also shares this delusion.

            Furthermore, I assume that the Euro rulers know Ukraine is being crushed all too well but choose to pretend otherwise for political purposes. It’s the sort of thing that gives cynicism a bad name.

            The slurring power of the usual terms is so worn out that they had to add some hype:ultra-nationalism,ultra-orthodox, evenultra-MAGA. (The president actually said this stupid thing, lest we forget.) Officially, all these threats are not just threats butever-increasingthreats. But what more is there to say?The last round of rhetorical escalation exhausted the word “extreme.” What’s more extreme than extreme, more radical than radical?Is there no ’90s BMX slang left to explain the world?!There is another…Always sad when our guys adopt these goofy terms. We don’t need any of them, because we actually know things.

        I have no clue how this war can end. Russia needs what remains of Ukraine to be a neutral, demilitarized country, but Russia can’t trust the West or Ukraine to stick to that deal. Thus, to enforce that situation, Russia would need to control Ukraine, which it doesn’t want to do for good reasons.
No obvious solution.

        Whatever Trump does, even if he deploys the entire GAE military to Ukraine and orders a  bayonet charge, he will still be slandered as a Russian asset and an enemy of “democracy.” So one wonders why he would try to make a deal that appeases anyone anywhere in Europe, who will give him no credit whatsoever.This war was provoked by the GAE, and waged for 3 years with little to no regard to the cost to the Ukrainian people, so its present claims to want “peace,” and to care about the Ukrainian people are risible. It just wants to be rid of the tar baby it can no longer handle, and for some inexplicable reason seems to care about the optics.Whether or not “Ukraine” descends into turmoil should seem to be no more than an aesthetic concern to us over here. Bringing us back to the fundamental question of what is so valuable about Ukraine in the first place. I still don’t have an answer to that, but somebody seems to value it.

        CTH: Romania Has Barred Leading Candidate Calin Georgescu from Postponed Presidential Election
Well, spit. If they can’t get a Yulia Tymoshenko in Ukraine, it looks like they’re aiming to get a puppet into Romania, all to have a stake on the Black Sea (and still a direct line to NATO Turkey, in preparation for the Turko-Israeli war on Iran.)

        She is the leader of the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) political party and strongly anti-RussianYou know what other European leader led a Fatherland and was strongly Anti-Russian?Finding a replacement is not a great challenge. The issue is finding a new leader who can sign a peace deal without the country collapsing into turmoil.I would argue finding a replacement for Little Piano Man IS a great challenge. Ukraine sounds (from the outside looking in, based on what I’ve read) like they looked at corruption in say Chicago and said “We can ramp that up to 11 or 12 druk!” It appears to be finding theleastcorrupt politician in a vipers nest.The question is can we buy someone and will they stay bought, even if we don’t send them money and arms?

        Putin wants a trade deal with the US, I think.  Trump wants lower energy prices and to put a wedge between the Bear and the Tiger.  I think both of them want to pull back from the WW3 fever that the Europeans and the US MIC have caught.Apparently, Zelensky has now offered the apology that Trump demanded.  This further weakens his hand after staring unequivocally that no such apology would be made.  That hurts him at home, to the extent he even has political support at home.The rundown of the various factions was very helpful in the column.  I’ve had the same sense – that Trump is trying to thread the needle of removing Zelensky without collapsing Ukraine into an even more complex civil war.The EU has no answer to replace NATO.    Attempting to do so would require suicidal levels of taxation and social welfare program cuts.  And it would require major participation by their new immigrant citizens from North Africa and the M.E.  Weaponized savages would quickly turn their guns on their hosts.And turning the EU intone NATO replacement would be like putting a school board in charge of the police department.

        Cut off the predominantly Catholic regions and give it the name “West Ukraine.” Two things going on with that Catholic element. First of all, they don’t like anybody. They didn’t like being under the Polacks anymore than they like being under the Russians. Second of all, because they are under the Pope, they are easily manipulated by the west.That’s what I believe anyway.People mocked the Russian Orthodox Church because so many in the hierarchy were KGB. Do you think the Ukrainian Catholic Church is any cleaner? They probably had moles for both sides. They were always considered unreliable as to their loyalty, even under the Soviet Union.Split off West Ukraine and then quarantine them like they did to Talos IV  in Star Trek!

Hitler was born to a practicing Catholic mother, Klara Hitler, and was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1904, he was confirmed at the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Linz, Austria, where the family lived.

                You must be so proud of your American culture. Your family trees look like black family trees anymore. Pretty soon, you’ll be calling each other “brother,” just like the blacks because of your family trees. Obese, tattooed, baby mamas, drugs, rampant infidelity, pooping out halfrican kids, Jew worship. I’m sure the entire world looks up to America and wants to be just like us. 😂😂😂😂

            There is a Catholic church (kostyol) in every Ukrainian town, as Ukraine was ruled by Poland for hundreds of years. And yes, Catholic Church in Ukraine did not cooperate with Communists as much as Orthodox did. I remember growing up in a small Ukrainian town that the priest was always in trouble with KGB: arrested, detained and such.

                The thing is, those Catholics were traditionally Orthodox. The Polacks tried to convert them into Roman Catholics. They rebelled and got to keep the outward trappings of Orthodoxy, but still fell under the Pope. But this little move created much of the turmoil over there. It created a group that was an “other.” They neither like or identify with the Polacks, nor with the Orthodox.

                    TempoNick is right on target here. Historically, the peeling away of Orthodox into Eastern Rite or “Uniate” jurisdictions has been a way for the West to encroach on Eastern territory both in Europe and the Middle East. (I have family connection to both Melkites, the Catholic version of Antiochian Orthodox in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and diaspora and the smallest of those jurisdictions, the Russian Greek Catholic Church which after the Revolution exists  only in vestigial parishes in the West.)  In my experience and what I observe abroad, these folks identify as “Catholic” to the point of adopting all sorts of creeping “Latinization”.I remember First Things writers plugging all sorts of Catholic projects to bring Ukraine into the Western orbit after the collapse of the USSR.  I’d bet that was the “conservative” wing of USAID at work.   Doesn’t make me proud of being Catholic.

                        I also recall Slick Clinton railing against Russia declaring Orthodoxy to be Russia’s national religion. He said it was discriminatory and anti-pluralistic or some such tommyrot. (He obviously wanted Western religions to have a free hand to proselytize within Russia’s borders, and it wasn’t because Clinton feared for the immortal souls of Russians.) The US may even have levied sanctions against Russia; not sure, though; that was about 27 years ago. The points being, the US adopted an antagonistic and destructive pose toward Russia long before the Ukraine proxy war, and that America’s soft war against Russia was prosecuted along many fronts.

                            Russian Orthodoxy will indeed pull together Russians in way that the American evangelicals threatened to pull them apart. We tolerate the JW and any number of obviously semi-destructive cults that send out salesmen.What I remember of the law is that it pretty much got rid of the street style, megachurch evangelization. The Catholics (there are small number) in Russia were exempt.Interestingly, Israel allows for both Orthodoxy and Catholicism. They are still 2nd class citizens, but they are allowed to conduct marriages, etc.

                        The one thing to always remember about this is that this has nothing to do with religion. Theologically, Orthodox and Catholic are virtually the same. In fact, I heard one Serbian priest once say that the only reason we don’t call ourselves Catholic is because the Catholics took the name first. (Catholic comes from a Greek word meaning universal, as in the universal faith.)The Orthodox/Catholic thing is a turf war and nothing more. The Roman Catholic Church serves as or allows itself to be used a proxy for Western interests. They attack the church because it’s a way to infiltrate and subjugate the East.

                            Catholic does not mean universal. It is from the Greek kata holis, meaning down whole, that is to say both the old and new testaments. Jesus came only unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel, not all races.

                Samuel Huntington devoted a whole chapter in The Clash of Civilizations between the Catholic West and Orthodox East in Ukraine way back in the 90’s. So when that fault line began to crack by 2014 I wasn’t surprised.

                Yes, because Catholics have a greater loyalty to just the state. It is the Orthodox who come to serve state governments of all kinds. That’s what’s hilarious about the analysis that comes after this comment. The Orthodox could theoretically be quite loyal to a state government in a way that Catholic might need to rebel.

                    What you don’t understand is that Christianity was “operated” by the five sees. In order of preeminence, Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. The Orthodox view was that Rome was just another Bishop, an equal to the rest. The Catholic view was that Rome was superior to the rest and Rome tried to take over their domains.That is the schism in a nutshell. It’s not some intellectual circle jerk over religious dogma. It’s pure political turf war.But that’s neither here nor there. The Roman Church is a laughing stock. A fraternity of homosexual priests preaching against homosexuality and abortion. I always joke that they are so anti-abortion because abortion cuts down on the supply of children to molest. … I remember being at a baptism once. I couldn’t help but snickering at the priest with the falsetto voice and the lisp. It really is both amusing and disgusting at the same time.Oh, one more thing. I have a friend who has a friend who was in a Catholic seminary in Michigan, I think, but left. My friend says his friend tells stories all the time of all the homosexual activity that went on.Sick people. It truly is the house of Satan.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentarchy
