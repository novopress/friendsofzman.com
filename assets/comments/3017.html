        How long before the US and the EU formally recognise this dreadful Islamic state as a nation and try to do business with it? I expect the UN will already be drawing up plans for its inclusion and all the usual suspects of lefty journalists can start telling us how well it is doing and how happy people are there.By the time the man in charge is done with being El Presidente he may well have met with the new prime-minister or chief mullah of the new country and talking about how islam is good for the Middle east, etc.This is when you want a time machine to hop into the future to see the real mess being made up ahead there, and to the world. If so, you may need to go with a shaggy beard (male or female) to avoid detection in this freedom-loving future.

        A war-weary America averts it’s eyes to thewholesale Christian slaughter currently taking place “over there”. What happens when that particular evil lands on our own doorstep? Not today and maybe not next week, but rest assured it’s coming our way. We had a beheading in the name of Islam a couple of weeks ago. Don’t imagine it’s our last. “Work-place” violence in 2009 courtesy of Major Nidal Hasan. Gee, ya think Islam could be the reason? Meanwhile, all over our nation, we have “refugees” from Islamic nations emigrating here. Why? As in, why are we letting them? They are exercising Gentle Jihad. They come here, do not integrate or assimilate, but simply bide their time until they have the sheer numbers to begin their agitation. Look to Denmark, Austria, and the UK for a picture of our future if we continue to put our collective heads in the sand.As for Dear Leader? His feckless attempts at containing ISIS are just for show. After all, he didn’t NOT do nothing. But he might as well have. When I’m wearing My Very Best Tin-foil Hat, I imagine that Barry is either a Moslem, or is a figurehead financed by wealthy Moslems. With the aid and comfort of his socialist buddies. What a junk show.

        Is there any reason to believe the Obama administration particularly cares? All they need to keep their press servants happy is a fig leaf. Air strikes are fine; it’s the appearance of pretending to do something. “Sending a message”. Good enough for government work.
