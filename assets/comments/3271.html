        When I think of Millenials, I become very afraid for this country. These young people have been largely coddled their whole lives. So many of them have had over-involved helicopter parents, never allowing their kids to fail, rarely allowing them free time as they were shuttled from one activity to another, including “play dates”. Everyone is equal, diversity of skin color but not thought, everyone gets a medal. Most Millenials have a Hive mentality. There’s not much in the way of original thought. I know a lot of Millenials, 2 of my 3 kids are younger Millenials. We raised them to think for themselves and to take responsibility for themselves, yet they both still gravitate to the Hive. When I point this out to them, they laugh. When I tell them how changed the country is from when I was their age and how they have far less freedom, they say “no one cares about that”. It’s really disheartening. They think I’m getting all worked up over nothing. My daughter is too young to be a Millenial. Hopefully her generational cohort will be different.

        Just another coddled eunuch so concerned with finding ways to advertise his high-mindedness and “empathy” that he hasn’t bothered to learn how the world actually works.
Millennials love to congratulate themselves on their ability to “understand” why another person might do an awful thing, but they never seem to bother with how they might prevent the other person from doing the awful thing in the first place.

        One presumes that he can avoid blaming his attackers because they didn’t pull the trigger and possibly reduce his life to that of a paraplegic. He got, unlike some, to walk away and still type in an controlled, if not always sensible, fashion.He also can dream about how these muggers would ‘think I was okay’ if they knew him. Some others may not be so sure about that.But his final, slap-in the-face for civilisation is that he magnanimously acknowledges the “police protect us by keeping those ‘bad people’ out of our neighborhood, and I’m grateful for it.” But, being a libtard, perhaps not as grateful as all that.Will he feel the same after mugging number five, say?

        What’s that dude’s address? I want to go take all his stuff, slap him to tears and wake him wipe my dog’s butt the next time she drops a deuce. Homeboy ought to take that sixty grand and get a spine and testes transplant. What a feckless homo.
