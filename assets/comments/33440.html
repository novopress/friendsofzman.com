        Ramaswamy has not been a boon to the right in any way politically. Yes, he did bring up “the great replacement” in a debate during the primaries, but little came of it. Also, based on his Christmastide tweetings, he seems to believe the great replacement is a good thing, particularly if it leads to his co-ethnics displacing white Americans in their vocations and as the dominant wealthy class in the US.Many older conservatives were enamored with him due to their experience with the first wave of Indian immigrants they encountered in their workplaces, who were far less belligerent, arrogant, and mediocre than the current crop and mouthed culturally conservative talking points. These older conservatives also worship wealth and those who attain it, a holdover from the cold-war mentality that any complaints about the economic elites and what they get up to meant that you were opposed to capitalism and therefore supported communism.The problem with Ramaswamy is that his prolific wealth came about not as a product of ingenuity and achievement. He ran a high-level scam that defrauded investors  for an Alzheimers drug that he knew was neither safe nor efficacious. After assuring investors of the inevitability of its successful demonstration of efficacy during phase 3 clinical trials and therefore its approval by the FDA (failing to disclose that it had already failed to prove efficacy under several trials by GSK prior to his purchase of the patent), he promptly sold all of his stock as it peaked, just prior to the crash when he announced the trial failure. He also oversaw the implementation of his company, Roivant’s, diversity, equity, and inclusion initiative in 2020. Again, odd for a champion against the great replacement. I doubt he covers this in his book “Woke, Inc.”Rockefeller, Carnegie, and the other robber barons of that age certainly had their faults. From Pinkertons to company towns (and the scams inherent in them) to the machination of American society via educational policy and other things, they caused a lot of misery. But we had railways, petroleum resources, and even concert halls to show for it. There have been no such benefits to Ramaswamy’s greed. Nothing of value was produced in the accumulation of his wealth. In fact, wealth was lost, whether it was from the purses of the investors or even the wasted time of doctors and scientists propping up a scam.

            Interesting. So that’s howRamaswamygot rich, by scamming investors and sick people. And now we know he was lying in the debates. Ramaswamy is not really against theGreat Replacement. He’s for it. He personifies it. He is a scam artist, of no use to America, andtotally disloyal.

            Back when Vivek first became the latest Republican thing, I remember saying here at Z’s place how easy it is to become a beloved MAGA guy or “right-wing populist”: All you have to do isnot lieabout normal Americans.He couldn’t resist. None of them (for any value of “them” you might enjoy) can. Their identity isnot you. You are everything they say they hate—especially when you’re notin factany of those things.Trump alone has no desire to defame us. That’s why no amount of propaganda can make him unpopular. He can screw up and blow it by being wrong too many times—and I think he finally has—but he truly, deeply violates the regime’sonlyvalue, as no other elite/”elite” does: He doesn’t want to hurt us. So he doesn’t have to make up rationalizations for doing it, and he never gets caught pleasuring himself to our suffering.

            I think it is great to emphasize that this guy is not and will never be on ‘our side’ but if he can be made use of to help bring harm to our enemies I’m all for using him to that purpose. Obviously, the man is an opportunist who thinks his next accomplishment should be political and such transparency makes manipulating him that much easier. I hope there are people on our side in the Trump admin. and I hope they do make maximal  use of amoral graspers like him to do as much damage to our enemies and their policies as possible. Assuming the history above is all true or at least people can be convinced it’s true, I would have to believe he can be reigned in easily if he goes off script.

        From the transcript:
No one knows this, but the Z Man harvests the souls of the wicked. He is a dark shadow that haunts the modern world, living off despair. When you take the black pill, he is there to welcome you into the eternal torment.
Mysterious. Not found in the audio.

            You’re right. It’s not on the audio. It’s also not part of the transcript on Derb’s own site, either. But it’s here, on this website. It’s an unexplained anomaly.

            Assuming that Z Man wrote this paragraph, that it is not a glitch in the simulation that Z Man sometimes speculates about, then it is a humorous description of Z Man and his audience.
Are we readers the “souls of the wicked?”Is Z Man a “dark shadow” who lives off of our despair?Are we condemned to “the eternal torment?”
Dark humor for dark times.

We are the Christian soldiers fighting for Truth, Justice, and the American way with the souls of the righteous, living off of hope and salvation.

        That French theater fiasco (in part-5) has been an ongoing fun fest, exposing woke-communists for theirsuicidal decadence. So-called “progressives” invite 250 “migrants” into their theater to attend a lecture on“Reinventing the welcome for refugees in France.”But after the lecture was over, the migrants refused to leave, and more migrants arrived to swell their numbers. They continue to stay there after many weeks, turning a nice, clean, “progressive” theater into a nigger-shithole – literally. That is typical behavior for all such phony “refugees”. They are extremeingrates.Now the theater is going bankrupt. Serves them right.That is what they are doing to all of France. And that’s what the Biden regime is doing to America, the Trudeau regime to Canada, and the Starmer regime to Britain. What do all these regimes have in common, I wonder? Who finances them? Who directs them?

        A penal colony on Greenland would be awesome.  It wouldn’t just be criminal illegals we’d be sending there either.  I can think of a whole host of others – many of whom who’s ancestors have been for a couple of centuries or more…
