        Here’s my question:&gt; Simmons got rich thirty years ago peddling ghetto filth to young white kids in the suburbs.And where are they now? What do they have to say? Are they still admiring degeneracy and worshipping the aggrieved? Still rebelling against The (White) Man?I’m staggered by the absence of white voices speaking up against the melanization of American culture. What I mainly hear is white men hating white women. What I mainly see is white men spending their lives in the pursuit of corporate sports (especially NFL and NBA), porn, video games, and all manner of negro-worshipping immaturity, rejecting their roles as husbands, fathers, and community leaders.And whining like little bitches about how mean everybody is to the white man.No wonder Michael Brown had the temerity to call Darren Wilson what he did. Blacks in the US, Caribbean, and Africa have been uncomfortable with “civil” “rights” for over 60 years, and with freedom for 150. They’ve been begging to be topped again. Looks like the Han Chinese will step in where white men are afraid to go.

        Unless blacks are dreaming of trying white police officers in front of all-black juries, which is never going to happen, sidestepping the grand jury is only going to move their grievance one step further down the road.  If the show trial isn’t stopped by a grand jury, it will be stopped by a trial jury.  It only takes one recalcitrant juror to block a guilty conviction, and as you say, the odds are getting very high that any jury is going to have at least one fed-up and weary white person on it who’ll be glad to knock the wheels off the grievance train.  Then what?

        “We’re going to get indictments now because America hasn’t seen what’s coming.”
One of the 13% says that? When the vast majority of the remaining 87% don’t like what’s apparently coming their way, the 13ers might wish they had kept their mouths shut.

        i dunno if rap music is to blame. Genes influence behavior more than culture. How many white people went on a rampage after seeing Falling Down or Rambo?  The THomas Sowell argument is overworn

        “Increasingly weary” doesn’t begin to cover it.  Sick to death gets much closer. Until Blacks give up their group-identity grievances, they will never truly be free. The ball is in their court.

        “Over 150K cases were brought before the grand Jury and and only 11 cases didn’t come back with indictments. It’s like lightening striking the black community over and over and over again.”
11 cases per 150,000 = 0.007% of cases coming back without indictments. Am I reading this wrong? If not, that’s pretty thin soup…
