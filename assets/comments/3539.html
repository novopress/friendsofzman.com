        The democratic mind rejects, too terrifying to consider, the observation that people are fundamentally different at the level of their DNA. Muslims are not the sole inbreeders in the middle east. It has been seen that Christian Arab populations in Europe are also behaving badly.Islam my be a suitable religion for an inbred and insular people who are bred to be ruled at the level of the clan, and like it. It is no kindness to drop them into the cauldron of an epoch civilization in decay. T E Lawrence wrote of Arabs–This people was black and white not merely in clarity, but in apposition. Their thoughts were at ease only in extremes. They inhabited superlatives by choice. Sometimes inconsistents seemed to posses them at once in joint sway; but they never compromised: they pursued the logic of several incompatible opinions to absurd ends, without perceiving the incongruity. With cool head and tranquil judgement, imperturbably unconscious of the fight, they oscillated from asymptote to asymptote.

        How many anecdotals does it take to make up a “disturbing trend”?If “campus rape” can magically turn into “1in5” can the same “math” be cited elsewhere?Unrealized privilege of the majority, or something?Math is hard.

        Even the Moslems who wouldn’t commit violence on the infidels themselves, are quite happy to see it taken care of by the strict adherents. I have always said that Islam is incompatible with Western Civilization. Unfortunately we can’t let them be when they are busy plotting the West’s demise. We will have the luxury of letting them be, in their various barbaric pest holes, when they are prevented from further immigrating to any Western nation, and we issue an ultimatum to those already here: assimilate or get the hell out. The West is at a cross-roads here, it’s time the Leftists woke up to that.

        Zman: I think it was Lawrence (he of Arabia) who said the problem with the Arab mind is it sees no grey (gray) so all issues are either black or white. With no tolerance factor built in, they will by their nature either be all for one thing or absolutely set against it. Negotiation and compromise have achieved a lot in the west, but it is alien to the tribes.
Seems a lottery which type turns up in the west wanting to be housed, fed and soothed.

        I would disagree here somewhat: Muslims have been killing Muslims for centuries, and they still do. However quite why the west chose to get involved in their continual wars is a mystery to me: it just gave the endlessly warring tribes another target.I am not sure all muslims are hell bent on killing the west as you say. The smart among them understand that the “the state you hate” provides the better living opportunities. No one wants to go back to the lands of fly-infested camel’s rears. Trouble is that even if there is only 1 per cent of the adherents who get ‘radicalised’ and want to kill for fun and glory, that still adds up to a lot of people itching to get their hands on a Kalashnikov.That’s probably more people than the west would admit, and as the left — who strive to run nations and influence policies — cannot admit anything but the mindless parrot-like repetition of their ‘core beliefs’ then we aren’t going to get very far.No, it isn’t going to end well and it’s hard to see how it will end. You always hope each muslim atrocity will finally galvanise our ‘leaders’ into seeing things as they are, but each one merely seems to boost flower sales and generate hashtag solidarity.

            UKer,I don’t disagree. It is vastly more complicated than I let on, but brevity is the soul of a blog. I think the general outlines are thus:1) Islam is incompatible with the West. I don’t just mean our current modes of governance, which is sure the case. There’s a reason Islam never caught on with the West, despite ample opportunities. It scratches no itch that exists amongst the natives of Europe. Islam evolved where it did for the people where it did.2) Arabs, like people everywhere, vary in their degree of religiosity. There are plenty of secular Muslims who are not terribly interested in Islam, political or otherwise.3) Trying to convert Muslim countries to Westernism, Cultural Marxism and the like is inviting trouble we don’t need. Similarly, inviting Muslims into western lands is inviting trouble for no good reason. The policy of the west should be isolation of Islam in the 50 some odd countries it dominates. Leave them be.
