        I watch sports, but I don’t get too caught up in it. This flat balls thing is why I keep my distance. Anyone who has played sports knows the air pressure is not precise in a game ball. Even if the footballs in question were under inflated, it must not have been noticeable. If it was, a ref would have noticed it.
But, the meathead jock sniffers need a story.

        I’m no fan of Tom Brady, but I find it fascinating that simple high school physics can prove conclusively that he and the Patriots did nothing wrong. Numerous engineering and physics professors have shown the proof.  But no one cares, especially the media.http://people.csail.mit.edu/jleonard/20151104_leonard_unh_deflategate_final2.pdf

        The question is not the ball’s performance, but the ability of a player to hold onto it when others are literally trying to whack it out of his grip. We could easily see that a ball with six pound of pressure would be easier to hold and harder for a defender to knock free than one of fourteen pounds of pressure, so it is only a small leap to believe that two pounds makes a small but significant difference in the most important statistic in football, turnovers.

Knowledge says a ball with 10 pounds of air is indistinguishable from a ball with 12 pounds of air. But, people want to believe.

        I dunno, Z. That’s like saying scuffing a baseball is trivial. It is for me, but not for the big boys. This is one of those things where the result predicts the theory. My  theory: the Patriots will have an NFL average for fumbles next year.

Scuffing a baseball actually alters the performance of a baseball, to some extent under the right conditions. A football under inflated by a pound or two has zero impact on the ball’s performance.
This story is a great example of confirmation bias. The Patriots have become the Yankees of the NFL. Everyone is convinced they are evil or cheating or in league with the devil. When something like this happens, every crackpot with the theory comes out of the woodwork.

        I’ve worked in editorial, including newspapers and sports reporting, for about 30 years. When I first started general-assignment reporting on a daily newspaper, when I was just out of college, I was genuinely stunned at how little I knew. Not only that, but it seemed most of what I did know was wrong.What was semi-amusing is what I thought I knew was pretty much most of this “cult” philosophy and narrative you criticize so much. I was neck-deep in it back in the late 80s. Eventually, I came to realize what nonsense it was.In my experience, TV and news reporters get a very distorted view of reality. You want to know what’s going on in the real world — talk to sales managers and CFOs, not journalists.

        ..”balls weighed two pounds lighter.”  No, no he di ent say that.  I nearly spit out coffee over that one.  As to the football controversy, meh.  Anything on the tube is fiction,  including sports and while I do occasionally watch a game I realize what it is, entertainment not reality.  I guess this same idiot thinks reality shows are real, black lives matter, and the check is in the mail.

        The Patriots are hiding a lie within the safest place to hide one, another lie. Brady doesn’t prefer throwing softer footballs. Aaron Rogers, a pretty good quarterback, admits to liking them over inflated.  No, it’s all about the most important single statistic in football–turnovers. And most turnovers are fumbles. League average is one per 105 plays. All teams are within 21 of that. The Pats are at 171 since 2006-7.Brady was obviously lying at his press conference, and he looked really pathetic doing it. Then he started gaining confidence as he realized those dopes were just not going to get onto it. Brady is trying to take one for the team here. This is a Belichick operation. Hilarious to watch.

            I’ve seen that fumble business floating around too. The trouble is, the balls are no more or less pliable when under or over inflated by ~20%. SI took some balls and used a gauge to test the ball’s compression. Turns out the difference is trivial. That’s a fairly well known fact, I thought. The leather used for footballs is not glove leather for a reason.
