        “I believe anonymity has something to do with it as well.”
True, and anonymity is important where trust is low. Same with autonomy and individualism, both requisite Liberal Commandments. These notions are paradoxically personalized and universal since they form part of a herd mentality. This phenomenon demonstrates well the danger of applying naked principle without a particular, concrete existence. Such a tangible and distinct existence is what liberals seek to destroy.

        Hannon-“Liberalism develops in city centers where hands are idle and where there is plenty of time to stew over undeserved wealth and class disparity.”I believe anonymity has something to do with it as well. In the “sticks”, despite assurances of “privacy”, folks actual contributions to the “community”, DESPITE “credentials”, are no secret.Sorry Janet “That dog just won’t hunt” is usually enough to get folks away from late night entertainment an hour earlier, and out of bed an hour earlier in the morning. Over simplified sentiment to be sure, but hopefully all here are familiar with (ie) “The Grasshopper And The Ants”, or perhaps, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf”.OT: While everyone is oohing and aaahhing over those “pretty” fireworks in the sky, try to imagine what they would be like if they were shrapnel loaded bombs, launched by your “neighbors” in the next town over because you, and your sphere of community, had the AUDACITY to deny them “free stuff” for not pulling their weight, and tell them “Sorry, that dog just won’t hunt!”.

        Liberalism develops in city centers where hands are idle and where there is plenty of time to stew over undeserved wealth and class disparity. Little wonder then that those so disposed will see destruction as a guiding principle.Traditionalism is the host for these wider experiments and does not “develop” so much as endure. The focus is on building, as noted above, and this is generally satisfying– and often extraordinarily productive– where conditions are not unbalanced.I will make a point of asking liberals what it is they are _building_ with their progressivism. I should be surprised if anyone offers something more creative than “a just society”.

        Two examples:“Your not turning the tide with ten point plans and clever tax reform proposals”.“If your a lonely, miserable failure in life, why not try to burn the world down because you don’t fit in it”.It’s not ‘your’ in these examples, but ‘you’re’, because ‘you are’ is economised to ‘you’re’, not ‘your’. Get it?Thanks.

        “Libertarians tend to do this by pretending Left and Right are two sides of the same coin.”Capital L maybe. small l (ok me) believe the majority of the existing GOP (as opposed to “the Right”, or “Republicans”)and recent Democrat converts of convenience  to “progressives”, are two sides of the same coin.I have to go Shakespeare(ish) on this one.“To be, or not to be, there is NO hyphen”

        I dunno, when you have this many narcissists and nihilists running around unsupervised, the only way to get rid of them is the fire, which — as you ably point out — is what they yearn for anyway.  But the yeomen among us (since it is my belief you can’t be a small freeholder type without at least a very basic moral foundation) hold back since they figure the fire will take with it too many innocents. Thus Abraham’s rather involved negotiation with the Big Guy over Sodom and Gomorrah.  But in the end, He is going to do what He is going to do and we have his promise that he won’t off us all.

        “…the end is always about pulling the roof down.”   Judge Bork said it.  Ayn Rand said it.  And now THE Z.  We can take it to the bank.
I wonder still if one should act according to the knowledge that the roof is coming down or that the roof indeed has already come down.  Haven’t quite worked that through yet, but with the acceleration of events lately I’d say it probably doesn’t matter which.

        Edaddy, I don’t see the difference between consuming and destroying. If you make pate out of the goose that laid the golden egg, you’re destroying the future which is exactly what leftist policies have done. They have stripped America of it’s vitality, resources and attempted to turn it’s men into sissies.

        Is the Left’s impulse really to destroy?  I rather sense that their impulse is to CONSUME.  Maybe I have it backwards …
Historically, the Left consumes everything “upon their lusts” until all is gone, after which the productive Right rebuilds.  The Right is a productive class not out of ideology.  They are productive simply because it is their nature to build.

        Understanding the so-called “left” on its own terms requires, first, an examination of what in the world could possibly make so-called “leftist” policies attractive to anyone with a nominal command of recorded history and a modicum of critical thinking skills.That is, what’s missing from Mitchell’s litany of progressive behavior – fairly accurate as far as he takes it – is WHY these folks CHOOSE to act as they do; WHY are folks attracted to ideologies which perennially demonstrate their unsustainability to the tune of tens of millions murdered by their own governments?By failing to ask and investigate this question, like almost all self-described “conservatives” – who consistently mistake so-called “progressives” for fully-realized, fully mature adults with a legitimate world view – Mitchell makes the fatal (i.e., socially suicidal) mistake of putting “progressive” and “conservative” viewpoints on equal footing. Ultimately, this leads to the notion that ongoing compromise with their preferred policies is called for. That inevitably leads to the ratcheting, wretching lurch ever “leftward”, read: toward the totalitarian end of the political spectrum.More detail:http://bit.ly/1gyngvDhttp://bit.ly/DmoX7

        Dr.Z,Cogent analysis of the nihilistic tendencies of the left. It’s interesting how many stunted, twisted personalities and shameless degenerates populate leftist movements. If your a lonely, miserable failure in life, why not try to burn the world down because you don’t fit in it.They use the schools and media to pour gasoline on the fire of envy, class hatred and dissatisfaction while praising Barbarians and subhuman riffraff cultures like Islam(curse Mohammed’s wretched name). Great Blog!
