        I must say, no one does antisemitism more eloquently than you, Z Man.
Why do we “tolerate” Chabad?  They’re strange, perhaps, but I don’t see them performing mass murder like your friends the Palestinians.  Why do we “tolerate” Islam, their ear-splitting calls to prayer, their honor killings, etc?  Perhaps you might ponder than instead.
Shows where your priorities are.

            lf you don’t see Jewish mass murder, you.must be willfully blind. Jews are the greatest mass murderers in contemporary history. More Israelis died on 10/07/23 by the trigger fingers of their own security forces than by any act of Hamas. But you are a mental defective and cannot grasp the horror that is your evil doing.

            Stupid binary thinking.
“You criticized Jews, so the Palestinians and Muslims must be your friends.”
I think you’ll find most here would say “A pox on both their houses.”
They can all take themselves and their Semitic tribal disputes back to the Middle East where they belong.

            I found the OP balanced concerning the supposed ‘Jews’.  And I’m a Jew by adoption, as Scripture attests.Christ noted that there are a large number of imposter Jews (‘synagogue of satan’) who ‘say they are Jews but do lie’.  It is correct to call out these elements and their agenda, which is both anti-Christ and anti-humanity.Certainly the ‘name the Jew and solve all our problems’ commenters are here, a mini-PLO . . . people who don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, what is happening on this planet concerning the (non-monolithic) ‘Jews’.In prior posts I have stated my objection to this  false mass-characterization, and I have been allowed to continue commenting on this page.  I’m not sure what the site host can do beyond this, other than censor everybody, which is neither practical nor ultimately effective.If the It’s The Jews! contingent here bothers you sufficiently, perhaps it is best for you to engage in dialogue elsewhere.

        “These nodes are often networks themselves,……As a result, no one is ever really in charge,…”This is the most important part.This is what’s tearing my heart right out of my chest.This is why I am almost given up.No, I cannot, must not, but I want to.We too were fooled by our anthropocentric upbringing.This is the view in which we were steeped.Our models were wrong.There is no center, no throne, no heart to Hell.Unless one were to consider the great, ringing iron heart of the Earth, who’s tolling powers the organic formation of the fossil layer.  Its vibrations- frequencies, that is- are the power source to the bestial layers.  This is the low roar the breeder-brained hear.  This is the what the neocortex Whites are deaf to, freed in their capacity to attune to the higher registers of Creation outside the greenhouse barrier.There is no heart to Hell.  There is nothing the Damned can target.The YHWH is a sine wave generated by and infectious to its transmission units.By the embodied.  At the surface layer, that is, on the ground.The only way to target the god is to isolate its members, and their contagion.

        The Cult in NYC and the outsized influence of Jews is why of course the last core bastion of the WASPS in the State Department are more rabidly antisemitic than even Hitler was, for the same reasons:  a challenge to their power.  This is why they work so hard to destroy Israel.They have a point,  does Wigglesworths .  If  Israel were destroyed the blow against their fortunes here would be severe.  If they weren’t so equally filled with hated of we Americans at the State Department then I’d reluctantly support it.As it happens presently they’re on the horns of a dilemma;  the State Department can either focus on  finishing off Trump and the American electorate’s delusions about voting in 2024, or they can focus on the last great betrayal of “colonialism” and undermine Israel to it’s doom by sapping their will to resist further- they lack the ability to do both.A pretty picture for their opponents; the enemy cannot choose between battles, both of which are intertwined.   They seem to be unable to choose… indeed if this compromising continues they may lose America and the long struggle to destroy Israel.We were never their friend, even Kissinger abused them mightily.   Oh yes.   Israel was a club to beat the Arabs for oil, the Pals a stick to beat Israel.That world passes … who shall survive?

            You are talking about the U.S. State Department, right? It is quite literally run by neocons, whose predominant ethnicity should be well understood by now. If there were so much as a hint of antisemitism, it might be assumed to come from the CIA officers they are forced to shelter. But their most consequential activity, which can hardly be taken as an indication of antisemitism, involves subverting various foreign governments in close cooperation with the neocons. While WASPs undoubtedly exist within the State Department, their influence is now much diminished as everywhere else in America. The Supreme Court, for example, has become a fairly exclusive enclave of Catholics and Jews.

        America is a nation, and it’s a Federation.Every American large scale arrangement from the Iroquois to the Internet and all between including the current if ending Constitutional Arrangement has been a Federation, this one will be replaced by another Federation.
It’s true we’ve networks on Top, but that’s normal.The Internet administratively is a Federation , because it evolved in America.  You’re looking at the core feature, an inescapable essence, not a strange bug of current times.

        I just keep wondering when, finally all the millions of white, chest thumping, gun owning white males, I say males and not “men” are going to say enough enough and fight to stop the madness. I’ve tried to form a malitia, but my fellow gun toting white men in my social sphere, think I’m nuts.Cowards all!

            That would be one of the dumbest things you could do.  You’ll be infiltrated by Feds, and all that will happen is you will all end up dead or in jail for the rest of your life.The hard truth is that you aren’t going to live long enough to see it get there, and even if by some miracle you do, it will be because normie can no longer eat.  Even that is a stretch.The other hard truth is that the good guys don’t always win.  Being hopeful that some day things will flip is fine and good, but if we’re being realistic it is unlikely to ever happen.  It will only get worse and worse and as Gen Y and Gen Z die off, the younger generations are programmed to believe this is all normal and they will just accept it.  White people will continue to decline and become the minority sooner rather than later and AINO will be a full blown third world shit hole.  The only chance of seeing what you want is if people are starving and can’t put food on the table or have shelter.  Quite honestly, I don’t ever see an end to it, it will just get worse and worse until it can’t possibly sustain and then something will have to come next.  Instead of that next thing being built by Western European man, it will have to be built my mixed race, black and mestizo  retards because that is who will dominate the land mass.I don’t have high hopes.  Instead of rushing off into certain doom, build peaceful community with other Whites who think like you.  Separate from the Jewish financial system and get the fuck away from diversity.

            That’s so fucking absurd it practically glows. Is your real name Ray Epps? “I’ve tried to form a malitia” — maybe you should learn to spell first.There will be no uprising of “gun toting white males.” You’re living in the most intense surveillance state in the history of Man. The surveillance capabilities of ZOG would give Stalin and Mao and Honecker multiple orgasms.And the ZOG apparatus is 90% staffed by white men who would happily put a bullet in your white head in exchange for a paycheck when they are commanded to do so by their black, lesbian or Jewish superiors. Sherman was willing to do it back in 1864 — you think the white guys taking orders from Lloyd Austin or Mayorkas aren’t willing to do it to you today?Your “malitia” isn’t going to bring down ZOG any more than the Doctors’ Plot brought down Stalin.The goal of whites in the future is not to LARP George Washington (and even in the 1770s there were spies and traitors trying to hang him) but to survive the inevitable collapse and anarchy when the idiotic, incompetent, and detached-from-reality clique of elites in control finally drive this country off a cliff.

                And the ZOG apparatus is 90% staffed by white men who would happily put a bullet in your white head in exchange for a paycheckMy BIL is a turncoat like this. He rose rapidly to c-level executive as a yes-man and functionary. When the (((principal shareholders))) met and dictated, the orders already drawn up, BIL executed them ruthlessly and without hesitation.BIL outsourced the entire department of skilled individuals who had created the value in the organization. All jobs to India, fellows he had raised his kids with and worked with for 25 years. Stabbed them in the back and parachuted outta there when the death threats rolled in.Owns multiple homes near multiple elite golf courses in which he and family are members. Plays golf all day long and never has to work or worry again. His former colleagues will have to work into their 70’s and some may not be in position to retire. Their own ordering a bullet in the back in exchange for the privilege of whacking a small white ball around with sticks. White America today.Do take note. Nobody is coming to rescue you because all it takes is one greedy arsehole to disrupt the trust paradigm you had thought you live in.

        I want to reiterate ProZnoV’s observation: “Zman’s broader point that no true ruling elite would allow a threat to build inside their own power base is a solid takeaway. (as usual).”
Also cmatt: “…why the J’s do it better.”
So, if Chabad was NOT a threat to the ruling power…what does that tell us?

            I think it’s more like “the elites aren’t very elite anymore” and they’re not doing the basic maintenance necessary to maintain their grip on the reins.
It’s the Machiavellian argument of “foxes” vs “lions”.  Foxes use guile to maintain their grip; eventually they compromise so much they invite “lions” (brute force) to take over.
Groups like Chabad probably should never have been allowed to take root here, along with dozens of others.

        Two things from me, please.First, the Zman’s use of “antisemite” is correct; it is a neutral, not perjorative tone, yet I  react to the word as if it the implication were negative.I don’t want Middle Eastern culture in my homelands.  They are alien, simple as.The JQ really irritates a lot of good people; it eats up all the oxygen and is a conversation killer.  True enough.What I noticed is that now I pedestalize and react, emotionally, to Hitlerian themes in the same way that some pedestalize and are inspired by “the light of all nations.”I see the Germans as fellow Volk, where I used to identify with Israel as fellow volk.I get choked up with pride from Leni Wiefenstahl rallies and European statuary.In the spirit of empathy, I remember how I was raised and encouraged to view Judaic  kulturekampf with such sympathies.  I regret having forgotten that my well-intentioned allies are repulsed by many themes that I savor, most especially the JQ.The problem is, many of the anti-Nazi themes are so useful.Nuremburg. Gestapo. Mengele. Concentration camps. Genocide. Master Race.The Holo itself.  As twisted as these projections are, they are immediately grasped.I get sick at the mention, because I know they are purely projection by the actual perpetrators, whom we were then taught to venerate.They reinforce the Libel, yet get the point accross.Yet also, they are the spike proteins in our people’s blood, doubling back on us.I forget that this is the dialect in which our erstwhile allies speak.This makes me overlook how many evil shits we have in our own race.They are the more pressing menace, sullying our name, so a more cosmopolitan cynicism is in order. It ain’t all Jays.I’m not giving their influence.a free pass; their direction and encouragement of schizoid pyschos has been doing a job on us for millenia.It’s a question of how the appeal to bestial combinations of low vice and gangster ruthlessness is what gets one to the top.How do we rein in the heartless bastards, who themselves become a system run amok?  Especially with the warped, recombinant dialect we were taught to use?**********I also don’t want their mythos as a guide.  It stymies us.However, Zionism also happens to be something else they stole from us.They were quite happy to exist in Islamic lands, because Islam is what evangelical Judaism became.  The brief evangelical period of Judaism didn’t evaporate, it changed its name to two Semitic forms of conquest millenialism.(Talmud Rabbinicals for those rebranches who outbred with Europeans, the Isaacs, and Islam for those who outbred with Africans and Indians, the Ishmaelites.Culture comes from biology,)Zionism is an American invention.  We took their concepts and transmuted them, just as we did repeatedly in Biblical context, trying to fit it to ourselves.At WRSA:George Bush (1796-1859), the distinguished 19th-century pioneer of Christian Zionism.His biblical scholarship convinced him of the prophecies foretelling the people of Israel’s return to their land.In 1844, the professor published his studies in a landmark book, “The Valley of Vision: or, The Dry Bones of Israel Revived,” rooted in the prophecies of Ezekiel in the Bible. “The Valley of Vision” sold more than 1 million copies, a publishing rarity before the Civil War. It turned Bush into a national voice calling for the restoration of the Jewish people to their historic homeland, (inspiring the likes of Theodore Herzl.)Yup, Zionism is Whitey’s fault.Puritanism and Papalism too.We really should consider stop trying to retrofit Abraham &amp; Daniel’s revisions.How ’bout we get back to using our own stuff first?Statues of Heracles and Apollo, anyone?  The Madonna and Child as Arya resurgent?Pizza-eating demons, organ harvesters, and adrenochrome pushers as our moral paragons is not exactly the flag I want to follow.

            I see things like New Age and Heathenism as muddled reactions against what you’re talking about. Probably the dreaded National Socialism, too.
As muddled, easily misdirected, co-opted, discredited— and used against us. Once people figure out what it’s really about, and what they’re searching for, good things will come.

            The fire was lit by Puritan Yankees and their offspring, by the northern abolitionist, Harriet Breecher Stowe lovers, Christian socialist (one of whom wrote the Pledge–one nation, INDIVISIBLE, got it now rubes?)–and the atheist Yankee heirs to Puritanism. Jews were the accelerant, recognized a good thing and in time led the show.

        As an addendum Z, since the mid 90’s Christianity, which this country was founded on whether or not people are willing to admit it, has been mercilessly hammered on. Yet, every other religious group from Islam to Judaism to the goofy quanza has been not only tolerated but endorsed by the elite. I know I know, destroying Christianity, which was a unifying force in uniting Protestants and Catholics alike, is a means to an end to dis unify the dirt people. But, instead of quashing all religions in favor of secularism across the board, these alt religions are given carte blanch. Z or fellow commenters care to expound on this? BTW Z you are absolutely on fire, maybe the move out of Lagos has jacked your creative juices? Hope the move brings you peace and prosperity. BTW I wonder how far you are from the Tim Pool compound He is any ally of dissents, even though he can’t bring himself to admit it.

            Brown Christians are actively fetched and pumped into US territory.White non-Christians are actively discriminated against.
White people are under active attack. Rather than go full frontal assault, they attacked attributes. Don’t trust anyone over thirty.  Male chauvinist pig. Christians vs not.  Abortion vs not. Etc.

            “…destroying Christianity, which was a unifying force in uniting Protestants and Catholics alike, is a means to an end to dis unify the dirt people. But, instead of quashing all religions in favor of secularism across the board, these alt religions are given carte blanch.”That’s such a good point.  America as a prepositional idea did indeed unify the many branches of European Christianity, a Christian ummah.At first, the colonies had strict rules as to which denomination was dominant, allowed, or banned.  Tom Jefferson’s famous line “separation of church and state” came from a letter to a minister, after he witnessed a Baptist tied to the whipping post in the town square for publicly preaching the wrong doctrine.  One could be whipped across the colony border for such a thing.TJ and the Founders were Masons, as was KIng James, who founded the Anglican branch- the official state church of the United Kingdom- and who authorized the English version, the King James Bible.(I may be wrong; wasn’t it King Henry who founded the Anglican Church so he could divorce?)  Free and State Masonry, at that time, was an attempt to syncretize all the known knowledge bases-sciences, the Biblical mix, Greco-Roman, Ptolemaic Egyptian, and a bit of Indian Veddic (whence came the spiritualist stuff)- in order to prevent another inter-Christian war.Hitler himself gave a speech declaring that Germany was a Christian nation, since he himself was nominally a Catholic.  They were interested in reviving Teutonic and Nordic traditions, as well.Of course, the revisionists told us the NSDAP was rife with occultism; they also told us that Germans said that they were the Master Race, and that they despised J**ish science.All of these are pure projection.  It is the revisionists who were rife with occultist Maimodean Kabbalism, themselves the Masters whose rabbis taught 1900’s schul students to despise and ignore EuroChristian science.{Just as their own Book taught that the Aryan Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was the cause of Adamic downfall; they could only understand a half of our sciences, giving to us degraded versions of such explorations as astronomy, medicine, spirit, metal sciences, water drilling, or pattern recognition.  Their proto-Bedouin forte at the time was herding, symbolic storytelling, and exaggeration.)But, looking back to biology determining culture, the Aryan-descended people were always quite lenient when it came to religion.  Rome had both a state religion and a hundred religions under the Imperial roof.  Since we are also a migratory people, branching and rebranching as our colonies leave and the meet again, balkanization within our own clades is natural to us.In Eastern Europe, the religion one is born into is stamped onto one’s identity card.  Yet like us, neighborhoods and competing churches sit adjacent without rancor.  People know and respect local turf, because they know who they are and are not.A religious map of the Balkans itself is a wild pastiche, a jigsaw puzzle; but they got along for centuries with this, and still went on to build the grand universities of Vienna, Prague, Belgrade, Warsaw, and Moscow.Summary:The demand that we elevate other wildly alien religions as equal to or superior our own stock, is, of course, the demand that we elevate other peoples as equal to our own.  Screw them.We aren’t going to take the Christian out of our history- Europeans took it and made it their own thing- and as the explorer race we’re quite good at assimilating foreign concepts, see the saints.Respecting turf doesn’t mean kneeling down to subterranean termites using proxies.  They can kiss Apostolic ass.Evangelism also needs to keep itself to its own flock, instead of feeding all the stray cats.  We are copying alien imperialists who themselves are about to be overrun by their own pets.  They’ve taught us some bad habits.dammit, I’ve written another book

                p.s.s.- despite my confusing King Henry with KIng James, let me stress that King James was indeed a committed early version Mason, congruent with Protestantism in general.
This is why the KJV is chock full of Masoretic code.Roman Catholicism, in its attempt to stifle our people’s natural inclinations, itself ended up with endless volumes of convoluted liturgies.
Universalism violates Nature’s order for organic beings.Empire cannot last.  Conquest, as we suffer under, cannot last.

        Dissidents are constantly paranoid about sex crimes against children for some reason. Maybe it stems from their own lack of success with women. If we use Occam’s Razor, it makes you wonder why Jewish pedophiles would need to build secret sex tunnels for their supposed victims when they already have their own private residences and a wall of legal and moral protection around them.

        Zman’s broader point that no true ruling elite would allow a threat to build inside their own power base is a solid takeaway. (as usual)Chapter 2 of J. Burnham’s “Suicide of the West” has a  39 point questionnaire to determine just how “liberal” or “conservative” you might be.This was back in 1964; it’s shocking how many “conservatives” today would be judged hard core liberals by Burnham’s standards.  Even, dare I say it, many here?Examples:“Political, economic or social discrimination based on religious belief is wrong.”“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression”“Communists have the right to express their opinions”(I don’t know/care about Chabads. Never heard of them before 2 days ago.  Would love to go 1950’s conservative on them based on what I’ve read though)

        This is a great topic to explore? What is this thing and what is its real structure is a critical thing to answer and nail down.Is it true that this blob’s greatest fear is a palace coup undertaken by a facade of a peasant revolt?Is that what Occupy Wall St. was then? Was some coup pulled off?Is that what the Tea Party was? Was some coup pulled off?OWS wasn’t crushed because it didn’t have to be. Ultimately those folks had so little understanding of the system that they were tools of the system. It didn’t need to be crushed, just redirected.The TP understood the fundamental power of the system and named it. Granted it was goofy in expression, but The Fed enabling Wall St and the money system was called out. They were crushed. The IRS agents, the DHS/TSA watch list harassment and others leave no doubt about that.Whatever the case, the dissolution of our borders and the total participation of all parts of the Ruling Regime seems to indicate they do not fear a peasant revolt, and they are all in agreement. It is too organized and supported by the entire coalition.The Islamification of The West came to light after 10/7 with the protests. The Regime has a monkey wrench in their plans. Replacement migration tightens their grip, but it exposes risks of client groups they cannot control and who vastly outnumber them.A very large peasant group exists in white America. Obviously Trump has them rallied. Clearly Krugman has openly stated, “their power is ultimately going to go away.” The system closed ranks on Trump. Hard to see who will stage a peasant revolt unless we saw it in 2020.I think one thing we can all agree upon. This is one gigantic dumpster fire.

        “All of this is a good reminder that America has never been a country in the conventional sense”No, it WAS a country in the conventional sense. Washington said so explicitly:“Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles.”It was a country from 1788 until 1861 — when the Feds rejected the principles of the Declaration and decided to use the power of the national government to kill other Americans and to subjugate the very states that had created it under martial law. From that point forward it transitioned from a rural, agricultural nation, founded by and for Protestant whites and based on liberal principles, into a capitalist, expansionist, militaristic global empire for which money and power are the ultimate gods.

        One of the advantages of importing a lot of bizarre, insulated, and autonomous tribes like the Chabads is that it creates a macro-social stew of low trust constituents that can easily be triggered to react in existential violence during a collapse event. A homogeneous society is far less likely to fracture and turn on each other during bad times; in fact, often the opposite is true and common folk pull together in these situations. So why import a crazy diversity of peoples and place them in close proximity to each other?Because the goal is to get them to kill off each other by nurturing anxiety and fear among these various groups and then manufacturing a collapse that gets things started. Hence the demise of the dollar and debt bomb that will soon explode. Why trigger a slaughter? To kill off the alpha males that might someday wake up and decide to decapitate the elites responsible for our downfall, that’s why. It also paves the way for the imposition of tyranny.That is the game they are playing. It really is that simple.

                Very true, which is why we must educate and train the sane cohort that still remains here. And there are millions of them, mostly ex-military and rural ancestral Americans that still know how to hunt. The woke disease is predominantly a city malady, so not much help there, but they can be counted on to riot, which along with the militias, will keep the LEOs and Feds quite busy.

this short video will explain why we are spending half a trillion on Ukraine.   we hired the azovs to provoke the russians into killing off the orthodox Ukes for them.

        There will probably be several new movies this fall about White Supremacists and J6ers using underground tunnels to move around while doing illegal activities. Not that anyone is trying to deflect from what happened recently in NY, I just sense these movies will be coming out soon.

        It’s interesting to look at the regime and try to figure out what’s going on. The basic takeaway I have is that these people are paranoid and not as confident of there rule. Obviously people like norm eisen, Adam schiff, Jamie raskin dan Goldman and Jonathan greenblatt seem very paranoid and not very impressive.
But it seems like the same thing exists for the gentile elite. the way the Clintons (or at least hilary) started vetting the media and demanding that they be given questions in advance, strikes me as something only a paranoid person would do

            Clinton wanting questions in advance is not notable. What pol wouldn’t want that? What’s notable is the media was already by that time sufficiently corrupted to go along with it. Probably eagerly in most cases. In many cases, they didn’t even have to be encouraged to ask softball questions.

        The best analogy I came across re the J question is that if a magic wand waved and every J in media/academia/gov’t positions were turned into green Martians or Somalians….well, there would be questions as to the extent of influence exerted. ie why is such a small group, 2% of the population, overrepresented in the halls of power?The frustrating part is how it is practically verboten to even question this arrangement in our country without the scourge of “Anti******” raining down upon those who dare to wonder.Look at officials such as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen; someone with dual Israeli-US citizenship, yet also proclaiming that we have an eternal fountain of money available for them. Our Secretary of State, Antony Blinken goes to Israel and begins by saying he is there first as Jew, not mainly as America’s SoS.Doesn’t that warrant at least a passing inquiry about loyalties and compelling interests?The examples are endless, but the point should be that foreign influence in my country should be addressed.

            Holding dual citizenship should be an absolute bar to assuming any elected position or unelected policy-making position. In a more sane world, dual citizenship should be prohibited, as it once was in America.

            Your example of the magic wand turning the Jays in power green or Somalian or whatever is a good one.  If that were the case, or even if they were all Mexican or all Chinese or all Indian, it would be alarming and everyone would protest 24-7.The situation of Jay-dominance can’t be pointed out enough.  Some will consider this negative identity and say instead we need to focus solely on building power ourselves.  I say both need to be done.Over and over, unrelenting, everyone you talk to, you need to let them know the extent of Jay power and influence.

        There’s another meme going round us trashy, common dirt people, Z. And I quote, verbatim”“Every. Single. Time…”I don’t get it. Seriously – a handful of faggots infiltrate the Catholic faith and molest the choir boys. Church numbers dive, people walk away from the churches as the clergy has their feet held to the fire – and rightfully so.Now we literally have rat faced jews in the sewers and hauling out chit stained mattresses… and the biggest crime here isn’t their perversion and sin… it’s that they have an undue influence on gubbimint? Nobody ever wonders what happens to the kids in these things.I am beginning to see a pattern myself. Power corrupts – and when it does, perversion and sin inevitably ends up on the menu. Epstein’s list(s) prove he has clients round the globe from formerly decent countries that would never abide this kind of conduct for even a second. And almost overwhelmingly jews are at the centre of this kind of thing and driving it. There are the exceptions, but they ARE the exceptions. Take a guess at who owns the porn industry. Helpful hint – it is not the Rotarians.The hell of it is that we get spun up about those bastards while forgetting that WE are the ones that let them take advantage of us. They hurt us by appealing to our vices and lusts. I think it was one of our esteemed commenters here that said something to the effect of “Thankfully, the jewish penchant for shooting themselves in the foot is ingrained at the genetic level.” Unfortunately we are joined at the hip with them in this retarded three legged race to the bottom of the barrel.If I survive the maelstrom the jews are helping us create… my voice will be telling what’s left of us what happened to the jew AND why.

            “The hell of it is that we get spun up about those bastards while forgetting that WE are the ones that let them take advantage of us.”
The ultimate red pill is realizing that the plebs will does not matter.  Power matters and power is the result of reaching the apex positions in the key institutions.  The Jews say America as a juicy red apple ripe for the picking guarded by the most naive idealistic fools on earth.

            It was the European greed for power that drove the war loans.The merchants filled a demand.  Their slave and spice (drug) traffic was a means to reinforce that demand, like adrenochrome ‘drips’ are the cherry to media stardom.
They just offer people what they they think they desire.What schemer wouldn’t?  Selling desires is their superpower.

        The only people without influence in this country are regular white Americans.  Why?  “because we’re all reaching for a “colorblind” meritocracy.”  Sadly, even with their standards of living in free fall, most white people in this country are still out their chasing unicorns.  The one thing that can be learned from cults like this is that parallel economies do indeed work, and “taking care of your own” does indeed work.

                        They solved (concealed) that one by pretending the mob in America was Italian, instead of what it really was, something like “Ellis Island-borne and disproportionately (even by Ellis Island standards) Jewish.” In old gangster movies the bad guys were every kind of “urban ethnic.” Then suddenly they weren’t anymore.Who “we” are, the role of each American demographic, was *re-decided*—first propagandistically, then in fact—in the second half of the 20th century. Final victory came in the ’90s, when “white men” were re-written from daredevil-geniuses on the moon to America’s most dangerous losers.Now, during a “labor shortage,” American companies won’t hire them. (Six percent!) Because…you know…the market. The freedom of it.

        What I want to know is what these tunnels were actually for.  The whole ‘secret place to meet during covid’ excuse does not pass the smell test.  Just how big are these tunnels anyway?  How do you move that much earth without heavy equipment?
I suspect these and other questions will go unanswered.  Any other group would be under serious investigation. All the charges against people arrested for the mini-riot will be dropped.  The law really doesn’t apply to them.

            None of the Chabad members so much as touched a shovel or wheelbarrow. They hired for dirt wages some of the illegal aliens they control. Other than the existence of the underground infrastructure itself, no evidence exists of tunneling project or who did what. We will find out jack squat and the event buried.

Not at all.  Maybe just a conspiracy to abuse children.   Just because an organization digs secret tunnels and child size stained sleeping mats are discovered inside is absolutely no reason to suspect these people are evil or up to no good.   They may have a very good explanation.

This is why I have such little respect for “observant” Jews.  Every “rule” God imposes on them is viewed as a challenge to disobey God using legalistic verbal “Jewdo!”  It is this very characteristic of them that makes them so dangerous in legal circles.  Every field they enter in large numbers are corrupt to the core.

        Chabad is only a foreign cult to the American people.  It is not a foreign cult for the rulers of the American people – to them it is perfectly familiar and part of the chosen elite who rule over us.  To paraphrase Kevin Alfred Strom: to learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.  The reason there was no journalistic investigation into Chabad during the Kushner regime was because it is these people who rule over us.  Describing this group as a  “widespread distributed network” obscures the fact that the rulers are really a widespread distributed network of rootless cosmopolitan merchants, always pushing usury and degeneracy on whoever has the misfortune of their presence in a society.

                Thanks. Don’t answer the question just downvote me. Are you talking about Kushner that married trump’s daughter? The guy’s a billionaire. Without trump’s money. In fact he might be richer than Trump.

            It isn’t just Monsey, Monsey has been that way for a while. A former female co-worker is from Monroe in Orange County and they’ve infiltrated and taken over the neighborhood she grew up in as well.She told me that when she was growing up there was a beautiful forest across the street from her neighborhood that all of the kids would play there. Now it’s gone, replaced with apartments buildings that are basically slums and all of them occupied by the hasidim. And God help you if they catch you in their neighborhood.

        I don’t think the common rabble (myself included) knows who actually controls America. I’ve long suspected that it’s a “follow the money trail” phenomenon whereby globalist financiers run this so-called country. Another hunch I have is that anybody who shows up on TV, which would include all politicians of note and even boogymen personae such as Bill Gates, only possesses symbolic/puppet power. The folks truly in charge are smart enough to remain in the shadows and use publicity whores as their proxies. But, as already indicated, I’m really not sure. The endless influx of media gibberish in these times convinces us that we have a better grasp on reality than we do. I doubt humans in general have every been very adept at sussing out bad information from good. And I strongly suspect that most of us know far less than we presume.

            I think that the distributed nodes of power (Evil) are pretty much how it works. No one person, one single group; but many – all working toward Evil. But, because of this, they rarely align and there is often heavy contradiction as they all seek their own Evil ends.
Of course, the main orchestrator is Satan. That much is obvious. And the Evil is real.

                I think you’re probably right — even if I personally strain to believe in “Satan” beyond a metaphorical level. Deep down, though, buried under a million or more units of skepticism, I do believe in Ultimate Evil. Among Evil’s greatest tricks are deception and concealment. Consequently, I do not trust what is presented to us by the whores known as the mainstream media. They are in the business of creating and perpetuating perceptions that serve the master class. They afford no value to truth. Even self-described conservatives are far too trusting when it comes to these matters.

                    The MSM, of course, always are either dishonest or/and manipulative. I find that, since I have stopped consuming the MSM diet, that I am far more productive. Nothing that say is simply of any concern. Even though I can no longer really converse with normal people (as a normal person simply wishes to talk about the “news”), on the whole, my soul is healthier.The thing about news is, when something happens you really need to know, you’ll be made to know and it won’t come via a paper.I believe that ‘The Ultimate Evil’isSatan. Further, that a Christian study makes a person realize the reality of Evil – and that is exactly what we’re facing.

            Listen to Martymade’s series on Epstein. You’ll see how one group – probably the most powerful group – works. You can see how they have an operation that combines money, bribery and threats (even threats of violence).
A Bill Gates or Musk have money and that buys a certain amount of power, but they don’t have an operation staffed by ethnically loyal people willing to do what it takes to get want they want behind them. That’s the different and why Gates and Musk are not really in charge.

                I’ve never heard of Martymade. Assuming that’s a person, how do you know he can be trusted? I’m not even suggesting that he might be deliberately lying; he could simply have bogus information. Or he could have 100 % correct information — but how could you be sure of that? How does a regular person, having little or no access to the upper echelons of power, go about verifying the claims of a Martymade?One thing that the Covid fiasco reaffirmed for me is that I can only reasonably trust people I know personally. The pro-vaxxers had all the might and money of Big Pharma and the larger technocracy behind them, so I knew right off the bat that they were shady. However, if some of the more radical anti-vaxxers had been correct, countless millions would have dropped dead by now from taking the jab. Conclusion: just because one side is full of shit doesn’t mean another side isn’t also full of shit.P.S.: This is more of a general musing about distrust than any specific objection to Martymade.

                Neither Gates nor Musk sits atop their bank notes tabulating and safeguarding the money. That’s all done by others. Imagine both fellows head for their island bunkers and the money apparatus decides to stop all movement of the money. It isn’t Gates or Musk money. Who controls the currency rules the world. And this who intends our deaths and erasure when expedient.

            A cog was broken in the machine and Trump slipped by them. They were so arrogant they didn’t think he had a chance, so the didn’t pull out the shenanigans. As we’ve seen in 2020, they covered all the bases. There is also the distinct possibility of wealthy puppet masters, who are fighting against the WEF globalists puppet masters and secretly backed Trump.The Uber wealthy get off on playing 3D chess against each other as much as anyone else.

            Last time I saw the numbers* there were only three “reliable Republican” voter demographics: white men, men on Indian reservations, and the weirdly dressed Jews.That alone doesn’t speak well of any of those groups, but it does show they’re not hopeless American propaganda victims.*It was a quick guilt-by-association reference, a Jewish feminist using shared voting behavior to “prove” a shared propensity to conceal sex crimes. That’s not a characteristic of white men or Republicans, but people think it is because TV says so, so she went looking for a way to conflate them and orthodox Jews (target of her accusation). The injun inclusion is perhaps “too good.” Believe it or don’t.

        “The Chabad people understand this, which is why they recruit members who can infiltrate these nodes. Most Chabad members do not look like those guys scurrying out of underground tunnels. They look like anyone else in society.”
Reminds me of the film “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.”
It also reminds me of many occult movements, which often recruit from among the wealthy and powerful.
Finally, I wanted to say that the hidden history of Europe is really one of secret societies (e.g., Freemasons but also many others). So perhaps we shouldn’t be so surprised at this one.

            Scientology used to do stuff like this.  Back when Ron Hubbard was still running things, they managed to get followers to infiltrate a bunch of government agencies – including the IRS – to steal private information on people opposed to their cult.

                To be fair, it’s a pretty damn good tactic.
Let Group ‘X’ be a tight-knit group with belief ‘Y’. Group ‘X’ then proceeds to protect it’s interests via infiltration and spreading ‘Y’ – protecting the community!

            I immediately thought of one secret society, Skull and Bones, from Yale.  Seems there are any number of notable, political figures known to have been admitted as they passed through Yale.  Could it be simply that most Yalies of the time were already members of the elite, or is there some connection to S&amp;B membership?Another thought went to a 1970 movie with Glen Ford, Brotherhood of the Bell.  In this movie, one also is admitted to this “secret” order and then good things happen to them as if “ordained” by a higher power.  Of course, every now and then a somewhat mysterious request is made of a “brother” to perform some task.  Glen Ford was asked to do such and refused, then bad things happened to him mysteriously throughout the movie.

                I enjoyed that film. Another I enjoyed — also for those who, like me, are oriented towards conspiracies was “The Parallax View.” Both these films were made at a time when the ruling elite allowed criticism of itself. Yet another was “Winter Kills” (based on Richard Condon’s novel) which got inexplicably pulled down after about nine days. Perhaps it was just too close to the truth.

                ‘The Good Shepherd’ also concerned Yalie occult societies/old money and their relationship to OSS and later, CIA.  What kinda relationship was it?  Well, a family one.‘Brotherhood of the Bell’ — for an alternate view of the masonic Arch and Bell, check out Leone’s ‘Once Upon a Time in the West’ where the Arch serves as a functional symbol.  Very functional!  Via the character Morton, an emblem of Atlantic Coast Masonry, Leone and writers show they know what’s up concerning European occultism and power.Skull and Bones is only one such masonic org, though a key one (oops pun intended).That the current CIA is anti-God, anti-masculine, anti-heterosexual, and anti-heritage-American is not a coincidence.

            ‘Finally, I wanted to say that the hidden history of Europe is really one of secret societies (e.g., Freemasons but also many others).’Yes.  Principally freemasonry, which has innumerable branches and side-cults . . . people like to feel important, dress up in neat costumes, take distinguished titles, harbor secrets that get them ahead.  Human nature.All, or nearly, of the current world-movers are members of one freemasonic sect or another.  You will not hear their names often, if at all.America was founded in freemasonry, and their various bodies rule it still, in an overarching sense.  The triumph of Total Feminism, CRA ’64 and race-grievance, Immigration Act, homo celebrationism . . . all top-down projects of freemasonry, which is luciferian.They are goddess-worshippers and globalists of the ancien regime, the all-is-one-and-one-is-all crew.  No accident that modern anglo nations oppress masculinity and fatherhood.  The fem-techno-totalitarianism before us now has been their dream for millennia.  New Atlantis and whatnot.  (They shoulda fried that Bacon.)Both the French and U.S. ‘revolutions’ were arranged by freemasonic societies, especially Bennie Franklin and his St. John’s Lodge (Philadelphia).U.S. intel was born in freemasonry, with the Ivy League semi-secret societies dominant.  British royal society is openly freemasonic, while MI6 is also freemasonic.  Much less openly.Kaabalism remains an essential part of freemasonic and related occult practice, entering into humanity while the Tribes were exiled in Babylon.  Nice going with that.God was their king, but people just HAD to be kings ‘n queens themselves and make up their own self-serving laws.  We’re seeing now how that works out.

        I’m surprised at how poorly the Chinese are at manipulating our government. As noted, they have plenty of money and certainly know about bribing people, but they don’t seem to know how to navigate our system.Maybe they’re used to a more centralized system and can’t deal with our system of scattered nodes. It also hurts that it’s hard for them to infiltrate the system with sympathetic agents, like the Jewish community. That said, China did a nice job of getting Chinese nationals into engineering jobs at various companies to steal their tech, so they’re not without some skill in that area.The Russians also don’t seem that great at manipulating our system.The Middle East folks – Jews and Saudi Arabs – seem to understand our system best.

            Not the Arabs — they have the same problem as the Russians and Chinese in that they belong to another civilisation. The Jews are part of the US, British, and French systems. They have this magical dual identity — as Europeans and Americans on the one hand but also as Jews on the other hand. They know the language, they know the culture, they know the hidden levers of power and which buttons to press.

                Yeah, Jews – at least the Ashkenazi – have a monster advantage over all other groups. They look like us and have been surrounded by our cultures for a thousand years so they know how to play the game. Also, they live here. They can play the long game.

            It is not that Saudis and Jews have infiltrated “our” system. Our system actually runs the Saudis and Jews, not the other way around. (Or rather, “ran,” but not for much longer: The Saudis are liberating themselves from the petrodollar and Israel is self-destructing.)
The Chinese suffer from their own brand of short-term thinking and cannot resist the quick rake-off, so they have no long-term plan. It also does not help their cause that President Xi is a colossal wussy. But they certainly do understand distributed power networks.

                “ The Chinese suffer from their own brand of short-term thinking and cannot resist the quick rake-off, so they have no long-term plan. It also does not help their cause that President Xi is a colossal wussy.”Again, your observations are faulty—and that’s being nice.China is eating our lunch primarily because they think long term wrt economics and where their country is headed.  It also helps to not be a democracy.  😉   One need only to look at their investment in infrastructure and world-wide economic relationships with developing countries to secure strategic minerals and energy resources.  One also notes here that the Chinese have not reduced their carbon footprint one iota and will not do so—as the stupid West does—until they obtain the economic conditions they want.  China will happily burn coal while we freeze in the dark.Their thinking is anything *but* short term.  Don’t confuse China—the political entity—with some of their more avaricious get rich quick entrepreneurs.  Rather look at institutions/facilities that have been built for the benefit of maintaining future world economic power.  And note, China builds a lot of high quality products at that—avaricious entrepreneurs not withstanding.As to President Xi being a wussy, he managed to break/subvert the CCP’s Constitution to have himself “elected” for a third time and there are no term limits for him now.  At the last Party meeting, he had the former President physically removed and banished from the Party.  Thereby eliminating his only obstacle to what basically amounts to dictatorship.  Xi does not need to have the “biggest swinging dick” as the GAE does, he just needs to build a better mousetrap, keep his head down, and wait for the West to collapse of its own internal contradictions.

            The Chinese, in China, though, are used to dealing with a broad network of people; a large distributed network. The Chinese are not as monolithic as ethno-nationalists imagine they are. They should be able to understand how to get in like Arabs do. (Though we’re speaking in degrees here. China is as monolithic as the US was in the 1950s. Meaning not 100% Han but a supermajority.)I don’t really know the answer, but I suspect it’s two things: 1) they stand out, and 2) most Chinese can’t think laterally.#1 meaning that East Asians (and Africans, for that matter) simply stand out more. In the brown goo that the US is turning into, the color of your skin doesn’t matter as much as the height of your nose or shape of your eyes.#2 meaning that successful Chinese, raised on aptitude tests for centuries, cannot easily make connections between two seemingly unrelated things. This is the source of why East Asians are terrific copiers but poor inventors. Their high IQs allow for the creation of great civilizations, but they are either highly antiquated or derivative. So to risk practicing psychology on a billion people, they see power in a straight line, not as nodes in a network.

            My impression is that the Chinese do not want to “take over” and “run” the US like the Juice do.  The Chinese want to control/benefit from lopsided trade deals, steal tech, etc. to enhance their own kingdom.  So far, they have done a pretty good job at that.  They do not need nor particularly want to run the US.

                This is probably true. The Chinese are very aware that they, not the West, are the giant of civilization throughout the ages. Only in the last few hundred years has China been second-fiddle. But the Chinese think in thousands of years, not hundreds.

            You have to remember that Trump was a Democrat — with all that that implies — for many years, and used to consort and party with liberal luminaries. Even an NYC Republican would be considered a Democrat in the rest of the country. Forget the bellicose rhetoric — Trump is not a WN.

                    Barnard:  I vaguely recall reading (cannot recall source or details) about the Javanka romance back during the first Trump campaign.  The gist of it was that Kushner broke up with Ivanka due both to his own very strong Jewish identity and pressure from his parents and community as well.  She was supposedly desperate to get back together and some Jewish celebrities pushed her case.Plus she converted – no idea of how seriously she ever took the Presbyterianism she was raised with, but she happily traded it (and any belief in Christ) for Kushner.For me, it raised lots of questions about Trump himself – not that I ever regarded him as a serious Christian nor that I ever felt religious devotion was a prerequisite for public office – but that he could apparently easily countenance his daughter utterly abandoning her cultural and civilizational background (not to mention thoughts of salvation).

                        Thanks. I looked up his other daughter to see who she married.  Tiffany Trump married a Lebanese guy from a family with significant holdings in Nigeria.  His brother is some awful hip hop performer.  Maybe Trump has elected not to interfere in their relationships. They didn’t exactly go for guys that would have reminded them of dear old dad.

            I recall reading somewhere that Jews looking to gain status and power make a conscious effort to marry into elite goyish families. I don’t believe it’s an accident that both the Clintons and Trumps have Jewish grandchildren.

                    Her father-in-law, Edward Mezvinsky, was a member of Congress from Iowa. He was convicted of 31 counts of felony fraud charges stemming from a money laundering scheme, which is utterly shocking. (/s) He served five years in federal prison.
His wife sought a last-minute pardon from Bill Clinton, but Clinton declined. Bet that made for an awkward wedding!

        As kind of an analogy to the alien invasion we’re experiencing, have you noticed anytime there’s some sort of “invasive” species introduced into our environment, be it fish, insect or plant, we hear all sorts of yammering, dire warnings and knashing of teeth.  The native species are going to be damaged or wiped out etc.  But when it’s invasive alien people, it’s all good.  After all, we’re all human beings, right?  We’re all equal, right?  We all bleed red, right?  We’re all brothas and sistas, right?  F them…

        “No one is ever really in charge, like we see in Russia or China, where the state is the dominant power and controls all the power centers.”
I’ve never understood why the managerial class is so keen to import millions of “arrivals.” Do they truly imagine that these folks are going to be added to their base? These are people who usually turn on their benefactors and bite the hand that feeds them.

            &gt; I’ve never understood why the managerial class is so keen to import millions of “arrivals.”When no one is in charge, it’s all signaling. Having someone in charge implies there is a strategy. With no one in charge, it’s all consensus manufacturing.Ever been in a meeting where no one keeps on topic because the lead is too weak to instill order, and it just goes on in circles for ages until some vague and trivial conclusion is reached? That’s what we have now. The meeting has been going on for years, and the consensus has not gotten any more in depth than “Immigration good, Orange Man bad.”

            The best answer I’ve read as to why the managerial class is so keen to import millions of arrivals is found in this great essay:https://www.eugyppius.com/p/bill-gates-the-global-depopulation?nthPub=751Particularly the part about exogenous moral orientation (“EMO”). I agree that this once-noble crusade has morphed into a civilization-destroying cancer.If you don’t read it, the gist is that the more “left” you are, the more you care about people farther away from your “circle” (which is your kin, your ethny, your like-minded associates etc.) and the White Man – I would be more specific and say “Anglo Man” – for the past few hundred years, as our Anglo civilization has drifted more progressive, has also gone on more and more ridiculous crusades against more and more ridiculous “victims”. To the point where it’s internalized and fossilized and nobody in the PME questions it; it’s like asking a fish to notice the water it floats in.

            “I’ve never understood why the managerial class is so keen to import millions of “arrivals.””I suppose it is an interesting question to ruminate on, but we’ll likely never know the true answer. Maybe the true answer is an array of many reasons – displacing whites, cheap labour, virtue-signal feelz, hatred of whites, desire to help the other (yeah, right!).In any case, I’m not really sure I give a Great-Whites’ front incisor to ruminate on the subject for too long. I can the symptoms all around: Chan  cheating on the Math exam; Chan’s parents getting angry at the school because they caught him cheating; Jewish tunnels; D’shontavious jay-walking and encouraging motorists to challenge him with his slow gait; Bin Tran serving me icily across the counter of his convenience store; Mahmoud and friends glowering at infidels outside their mosque; the infighting between various Indian castes at my multi-national firm; Abdullah depositing all his garbage in his front yard, and proudly waving the Somali flag from his window; Omar grooming young white girls he believes are trash…I could go on, and on, and on.

                OrangeFrog:  Precisely.  It’s enough to know they hate you – and your children – and your civilization.  At this point the ‘why’ seems almost navel gazing, and meanwhile most normiecons would still deny the existence of the hate in the first place.
It all stems from a refusal to believe in the existence of evil – both as a power unto itself, and working through evil men and women.

                    A lot of it is punitive, imho.  The hard Left hates traditional/mainstream America and all aspects of normality.  Promoting the interests of The Other, foreigners, criminals, trannies, commies, assorted freaks, etc is mainly about screwing over Whitey.
Lefty activists set the agenda, the political class monetizes it (or, in the case of the GOP, monetizes its faux opposition), the media sells it, and the institutions and Democrat grassroots enforce it.

        As a result, no one is ever really in charge—Saw this recently with Lloyd Austin, the man nominally in charge of the DoD, who disappeared and no one thought to even look for him for a week or two.Immigration is always a tool of the ruling elite.—Just expand on your point, it doesn’t even seem like there’s a master plan to the current ongoing invasion outside of the short-term obsession with “sticking it to YT”.  Calls to the elites that such a scheme won’t work out for them either go unheeded, not that, as you note, there is even an “elite” in charge to appeal to.

            I follow Russian media and to lesser extend official Chinese media. In both cases, they focused on the fact that he disappeared and no one noticed. Western media focuses on the drama of him not informing the WH. China and Russia are deeply concerned with who is actually in charge, not the drama of the people put out as the people in charge.

                That’s a good point. You can feel the Chinese and Russians just trying to help this dying empire recede in an orderly and safe manner. But how do you do that when you can’t figure out who’s in charge.That’s been the case since Trump came into office. He was a power center but the managerial class hated him so much and we’re off doing their own thing, so who do you deal with if you’re China or Russia. With Biden, it’s even worse. He’s obviously not in control (though he occasionally wakes up and demands some bizarre action), but who behind the scenes is in control. It doesn’t seem like any one group has final control.How does Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and others deal with that?

                    Maybe that is where we come into play.Someone the other day said it best that the Heritage American wants to enjoy this paradisical continental Switzerland.If we could get seriously organized, perhaps we are the node that they feel comfortable with as being aligned with an orderly draw down. Not sure how that works.With the 10/7 events the youth at the Chabad are going to be more organized and determined than ever.The immigrant invasion is an utter catastrophe. It is highly organized. You have dedicated backpack carriers that coordinate groups and their supply line. You have interior movement mechanisms. You have housing, food, goody bag distribution centers.Someone has the invasion planned out. The Republicans non-response and total impotence is criminal. We are going to have to undo this. We are going to have to rediscover our resolve.

                        Lineman,
I suspect that a lot of whites will, in fact, disappear. I still believe that 100 years from now, they’ll be a good amount of whites roaming this earth, but they will be very different from the whites that we see now.
They will be harder, more cynical and definitely more tribal. We’re about to go through a genetic bottleneck.

            On the Lloyd Austin subject, I’m really kind of mystified as to why D.C. politicians have adopted the Arkansas degenerate strategy of lying reflexively and shamelessly about even about the most trivial matters.  It appears now that Austin was undergoing surgery to treat prostate cancer, yet he or his flunkies lied about him going into the hospital at all and then lied about it being elective surgery after being found out.  Why not just say upfront that he had cancer and he was in the hospital for treatment?  Most would have just wished him well and thought little else of it, but with the ceaseless lying everone has to wonder if there is something even more suspicious taking place.It reminds me of the time Obama’s chef drowned near his compound on Martha’s Vineyard.  It’s not unreasonable to think it was some kind of accident, but the immediate response by the Obamas was to start lying about where they were.  They lied and said they were nowhere near Martha’s Vineyard when it happened and then it comes out that – yes – they were on the island after all but supposedly away from home having dinner or something.  When lies are the immediate knee-jerk reaction of everyone in power, then everyone can justifiably start to assume something untoward is taking place.

                MacArthur said of Roosevelt “A man who would never tell the truth when a lie can serve him just as well.”
A lie is infinitely malleable, while the truth is not.  These vermin find some utility in that.  The Clintons definitely mastered the technique.
What kind of creatures are these that always reach for a lie first?
