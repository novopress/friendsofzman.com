        Simplify the world, live better lives. Regression to the means may be part of this, a correction if you will.I do want replacement level populations but only for certain races and countries. If India, China and the large ethnic urban areas dried up, it would be great planetary improvement.

            The trad people told us Bill Gates was trying to reduce Africans with vaccines. Or something. And we needed to stop him!  Anyway, if that was his dastardly plan it didn’t work.

                    Unpopular opinion: We’re not smart enough as race to “engineer” any virus, particularly if we barely understand how viruses spread. It’s just that the Cloud People like to think they are God, and won’t really fight against ideas that encourage that opinion in the Dirt People.2nd unpopular opinion: Many elites really did think they were saving everyone with their crap “vaccine”. At least in their minds, they were the hero of the play. That includes some of the players who knew better. RNA technology had so much promise, if we could just work out the little “bugs” like it not working, causing circulatory problems and turbo cancer.

                        Viruses are engineered every day. What cannot be controlled (yet) is how fast they mutate in the wild.

                            I don’t think it’s too much to ask to describe me a bit of the “engineering” process and/or a lab that openly claims to “engineer” viruses for research or profit. Before 2020, “engineering” what amounts to a bizarre chemical strand that lives between alive and not, with almost unpredictable infection rates would have been laughable. We only take it seriously now because we lived through a mass hysteria.

We must start at what constitutes engineering a virus.  Not heard of starting from scratch as Mother Nature would do, but have heard of engineering virus modifications such that the abilities of the virus to infect and produce “mischief” has been discovered.  Hence the “gain of function” research Fauci has vigorously denied he funded.WRT Covid-19, there are reports that the initial virus removed and studied from first victims was indeed modified.  Part of the gain of function process seems to be to insert certain “break points” in the virus (RNA) span that allows for the insertion of modifications at those points.  This being discovered by those who know how gene insertion works given present technology and do such themselves.  These break points never being found previously in Nature.Tha’s about it for my limited knowledge, but gives you a point to begin a search for such on the Internet.

                                    “Hence the “gain of function” research Fauci has vigorously denied he funded.”Funding research does not mean it’s even possible, as every grant writer worth their salt is painfully aware. I absolutely believe Fauci might have been involved in funding supposed “gain of function” research. I also believe labs are not against free money and pretending to be accountable. I’m sure it’s possible to create RNA snippets as you describe. Having those quasi alive chemicals infect actual people at all is whole different issue.“WRT Covid-19, there are reports that the initial virus removed and studied from first victims was indeed modified.”In other words, there was a rumor that the virus was modified. How does one “remove” a virus from someone? We can swab someone for a virus and see if they have been exposed to it. It does not even mean they were ever sick with it.  COVID-19 stands for coronavirus disease 2019. “Coronavirus” is simply a family of cold viruses that mutate just as regularly as influenza viruses. There’s no “original” coronavirus to be found to be modified against. The only thing that can be said is that this virus was found fits into a family pattern or is an exact match for a virus previously discovered.

                                        Viruses are removed commonly for study and use in vaccine.  How do you think we developed smallpox vaccine?  The entire process of genome identification involves the removal of “snippets” of dna and the multiplication (growth) of them artificially.
Geez, just do some Googling on the subject before spouting off on things you do not know.

                                            “Viruses are removed commonly for study and use in vaccine.” “Removed” is a very generic verb that generally applies to buildings, not human biology. Yes I’m quibbling here, but this where people fall into “We can engineer a virus (like we do a bridge)”. That’s where the temptation to use the highly imprecise verbs comes from.“The entire process of genome identification involves the removal of “snippets” of dna and the multiplication (growth) of them artificially.” In other words, we have to have a living organism with bodily fluids that contain the genetic sample of the virus. A sample is taken of those fluids, not that the virus is “removed” from the living organism. We need to use chemical and physical processes to extract just that virus’ genetic snippet. Then we have to figure out how to insert that snippet into ideally a bacteria that is compatible and will replicate the snippet, because a virus cannot do so itself. Not all living things will replicate that snippet and we can’t use or test humans, the actual target of our studies. All viral reproduction is “artificial” because viruses don’t replicate themselves.Anyway, the words in common in use in the Angslophere is hiding the complexity of this process. If we were speaking a little more clearly, I think it would be obvious that anyone specifically designing a genetic virus snippet to attack a particular human population is a little far fetched.

                                    To be fair, though, a lot of what is called “genetic engineering” we used to call “nigger-rigging”.“Let’s see what happens if we take this sequence out of this strand, and stick it into this other strand.”Desktop PCR has brought this ability to anyone with half and understanding of DNA and a couple grand burning a hole in his pocket. There are some very limited versions you can buy on Amazon for under a grand and have up and running next week.I’d think the number of people who could engineer something using only base pairs would be approximately zero. But the number that can tinker with existing “life”? Easily tens of millions.

                                        “But the number that can tinker with existing “life”? Easily tens of millions.”I’m giving people this point here. My issue is how long does it take to have something like not random chemicals and how do you test a successfully “engineered” virus. There’s no way to measure it because we don’t entirely understand how people get sick. We can’t repeatedly get people sick for testing purposes.  In the sense of trying to target people with an illness, it just doesn’t happen, even with the “tinker with something already existing”. I will give random chance during tinkering. But I don’t believe I can call a lab up and go “Give a me virus that mostly affects the Chinese but not us.”

                                The basic trick is to use what are called restriction enzymes to cut the viral DNA or RNA at a certain point and then introduce artificial sequences from circular strands of DNA/RNA (called plasmids) that are then cut by the same kind of enzymes. You also need enzymes that “repair” the broken ends of the strands and thus create the modified virus. The whole process is random but if you have enough viral and engineered genetic material you will get the desired result just by chance. They’ll also use tricks such as inserting a gene to confer resistance to a certain anti-viral drug into the plasmid. Then only the “engineered” viruses can replicate.

However, it’s not what most people mean by an “engineered virus”. They mean something much like building bridges to a certain load capacity.“Then only the “engineered” viruses can replicate.”By definition they don’t replicate. They need life to replicate. That’s one of the many difficulties.

                        I agree with most of what you say. But I would argue that we do engineer viruses, at least to some extent. Granted, we are far from fully understanding how all the parts work, but we most assuredly have the power to cut and paste different viruses to create a new virus and see what, if anything, interesting happens. This is just gene splicing, and it’s been around for many decades. Just to give two illustrations: A tomato with a pig gene in it, which concerned certain Muslims as to whether it was allowed to eat or not, or less practical projects, like cats that glow in the dark (gene from a jellyfish).To make an imperfect analogy using automobiles: a true “engineer” would, of course, be able to design and build a vehicle from basic parts. Our present level of genetic engineering might be as sophisticated as putting the carburetor from a 1973 Plymouth Fury into a 2015 Honda Civic and then seeing how it works, if at all.

                                Point conceded. So do viruses. But I’m pretty sure that a house cat and a jellyfish, or a tomato and a pig, would not typically recombine under natural conditions 🙂

            I have a daughter in college so I can give you the flip side from her and her friends. Granted, she’s still dating her high school boyfriend who’s also in college so I can’t speak personally about her dating scene. Also, these are pretty smart, upper middle-class young women who are doing well in life, though this is the type that most guys want to marry.Most don’t care much about a career and want to get married. Yes, they’ve been indoctrinated into the “you have to have a career to be independent,” but I don’t see them buying it much. Most would be just fine having their husband work. Admittedly, most of them, including my daughter, had stay-at-home mothers, so they saw how nice it was. They’re not itching to be VP of something or other.Unfortunately, yes, they do have ridiculously high expectations. Six-foot tall (or taller as most of them played volleyball), college-educated, etc., is their baseline. I’ve mentioned to them that women outnumber men nearly 2 to 1 at college, so it’s impossible for all women to get this. They don’t care.And, yes, while many (most) college-age women are crazy, a lot of the guys are socially awkward soy boys. It’s tough on both sides.That all said, these young women aren’t fully buying the “girl power” stuff. Most of my daughter’s friends just want to find a nice guy and get married.

                        Trust me, I ain’t special. As to my daughter and her boyfriend, she’s not alone in this. I’ve been surprised how many kids from her high school are still with their high school boyfriend or girlfriend. This generation is very throwback in many ways.Also, the slutty thing seems to be very bifurcated in college. Yeah, there are some girls that seriously sleep around, but a lot of girls don’t – at all. When I was in college, there seemed to be more girls in the middle. I’d expect that there’s a lot less sex happening on college campuses today than 30 years ago.But, yes, young women are very easily led. But with these girls, you can see them picking up on the fact that what they’ve been told doesn’t seem to be working, something is off, and they can sense it.Again, none of them talk about how they want some great career. A job is almost a backup plan in case they can’t find a guy. They’d toss it aside in a heartbeat.Now, regarding expectations, well, we’re still working on that, though my kids just want a nice guy.

                        Women have always loved tall guys. It’s just that in the past, they loved having a decent guy who could provide a home a lot more.
Letting women work messed up their priorities. Now that they can earn money for themselves, they let their childish expectations takeover.

As to the 6-foot requirement, most of the ladies have grown out of that, but they did have silly expectations coming out of high school. But, then, don’t we all.
Also, at least amongst the girls that I know from kids, this generation is more conservative than older people. They dread the idea of divorce.

                                Unless you advocate for the end of ALL and ANY advantage for women in education or any other field, there is no common ground. Unless any and every advantage given to women in anything is eliminated or unless you advocate the end of all advantage, not interested. You complain about the boys who are put down in every avenue from entertainment to school where they forced to be 6 hours a day for 9 months a year. Start by ending all female advantage forever.That spot in college could have gone to a male since your daughter wants to be a stay at home mother, though that’s doubtful considering college is her life now. No more of this equality crap. The entire girl boss, gynocentric order whoreshit is a massive reason for the population drop in addition to women killing the next generation in mass via abortion.

As to that college spot going to a boy instead of a girl who would like to stop working at some point, you have a logical point, but you might as well be making a case for how many angels can fit on the head of a pin.
You play the game by the rules as they are, not how you want them to be.

                Unfortunately, yes, they do have ridiculously high expectations. Six-foot tall (or taller as most of them played volleyball), college-educated, etc., is their baseline. I’ve mentioned to them that women outnumber men nearly 2 to 1 at college, so it’s impossible for all women to get this. They don’t care.There is no more succinct way to summarize the problems in the world than this.The best, smartest young women, raised correctly with smart, moral parents showing the way, all armed with logical arguments and tons and tons of data and…They don’t care.Women are incapable of making decisions. Especially important decisions. It’s not their fault, it’s their biology. Putting women in charge of anything will ultimately lead to its destruction. This includes the human race.

                    I was probably a bit harsh on those girls. That was more their attitude coming out of high school. I think that they are tempering their attitude a bit after having seen a some more of the world.
That said, I agree. These are bright, young women and they still like children in many ways. Women, especially young women, simply aren’t logical. Trust me, I try to steer them in the right direction.

                    First, what fucking retard down voted Lineman’s statement.Second, Lineman, I definitely have told my kids exactly that. I’ve told them many a time that a guy with good skills is a guy with good skills. Whether they get those skills by going to college and majoring in something useful like engineering or by going to a two-year school or just learning on the job doesn’t matter.My other daughter is dating a guy who will be going into a program for working on high-performance engines. Sounds great to me and her.I have to say that I was probably a bit harsh on those girls in my comment. That was their attitude coming out of high school. They’re learning. They are more looking for a man who is responsible and, well, a guy and not a soy boy.That said, my comments that if they want a man, then they need to act like a woman doesn’t always go over so well, though even that is starting to change. Again, the propaganda with at least these girls didn’t seem to dig in as deep into their brains as older women. These girls don’t seem invested in the feminism ideology, so they throw it away easier.

                            Yep. It’s just about having skills that people need. Not want but need. Whether that skill is employed using a computer or a tool in your hand doesn’t matter. Do you have a useful, needed skill that can provide for a home and family?
That’s the only question that needs to be asked.

p.s.- girls want a guy tall enough to lay their head on his chest. In a global survey, the first thing women mentioned was, “tall”.
I know this because all my uncles are 6’5″ and above, while Moms had to go and marry the short Irish guy who liked a good scrap.

                        ‘That said, my comments that if they want a man, then they need to act like a woman doesn’t always go over so well’Men must change endlessly to be whatever society demands (and right now society demands men behave like women, or else). Women are perfect and need no correction, reflection, improvement or change. Just ask them.Please excuse me butting into your chat, but after masculinizing females — making them little padded-shoulder men with differing sex equipment — many men don’t want them anymore. Why?Well because men don’t want a competitor for a wife, they want a FEMININE helper, as God intended. Men don’t want a masculinized female, which like it or not, largely is what currently exists in the U.S. and culturally allied nations.Men don’t want a marxist Equal Partner in marriage or relationship. They want wives who follow their lead, and their desire for this obeys both the divine and the natural order.

                Fair, butWhat are they bringing to the party?  yeah they just want to be married and stay home while the husband works.   While they………………….clean, cook, care for things, nurture, comfort, etc?   they seem to be missing that part (young women in general, not yours specifically)Most women (heck almost all now because of social media) completely over rate themselves.  They are all 10’s and will only date or see 10’s.  When in reality they are 5’s and should be looking at 5’s.   Social media is a complete cancer.most of the men that are not socially awkward soy boys are working hard every day, but  they are literally invisible to these women.  The men all doing the trades, working at this or that, totally invisible.   Even though they might be 6′ tall, making 6 figures (tradesmen), etc   Totally invisible, beneath their station.

                    Agree. As I mentioned somewhere, when these younger ladies mention that they want a “man” and not some soy boy, I tell them, “Well, if you want a man, you need to be a woman. Dress like a woman. Talk like a woman. etc.”That doesn’t go over well.And, yes, many do overestimate their own looks and value, or, even if they don’t and know that they’re a 4, they still want the Chad. It’s bizarre.However, there are a decent amount of young who do understand what’s important in a guy.But I definitely agree that most young women – even the nicer, more realistic one – are completely brainwashed about their role as a wife and mother. You are correct (for the most part) that even the good young women have an issue with being in the role of stay-at-home mom, even if that’s what they want for their kids. They definitely find the regular parts of the job – cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. – to be “beneath” them.That’s absolutely one area where the propaganda has won – and won big time. Then, there’s the hate that stay-at-home moms get from other women who are either unmarried or married but working. It’s unbelievable.

                    Small sample size. Also, most of these young women grew up in a house with a stay-at-home mom but also saw friends where the mom worked. They saw what was better for the mom and the kids.
These are unusual girls in that sense.

                “Unfortunately, yes, they do have ridiculously high expectations. Six-foot tall (or taller as most of them played volleyball), college-educated, etc., is their baseline”And this is where the whole cock-carousel thing comes in. Sure, they’d marry and settle down at 22 but only to Mr. 666 (hmm… that number reminds me of something). Since Mr. 6s is more like Mr. 404 they just get a job in HR and spend their 20s riding random dicks because “there are NO good guys left”. Every office has a group of these little sluts who head out to the clubs every Friday after “work” and scout bad boys and swarthy lowlifes for each other then exchange their tales of depravity on Monday morning. Young women quickly turn into complete garbage unless they’re heavily reined in and supervised.

                Women of any age often have ludicrously unrealistic expectations for Mr. Right.I don’t know if Severian will weigh in now, but this topic often comes up at his blog. I’ll try and repeat some of his major points, as well as other readers’ (from memory, so I accept blame for inaccuracies or omissions.) Also, some of the comments could apply to men too, in context.People tend to think of themselves as being better than they really are. This is a human universal; just a manifestation of our egos.As a result, women think they are prettier, smarter, more talented, etc. than they really are (unrealistic self-image or self-assessment).They set absurd requirements for the men they will even talk to, much less date or marry.This leads to the majority of women chasing a minority, perhaps a tiny minority, of men, those who tick the right boxes.Problems ensue, of course. Here are but a few consequences:The desirable men “suffer” an embarrassment of riches. Chad Thundercock has more women after him than he knows what to do with. If he’s a he-slut he may screw as many as are available. Even if he’s (relatively) a one girl at a time type, this doesn’t dilute his desirability in the eyes of the other women competing for him.The situation approaches a “winner take all” scenario, but not quite.Less-desirable men, but who would be been adequate as partners, tend to be marginalized. Many men will perceive this, consciously or subconsciously and may tend to shy away from potential dates. If all the girls, even the 5s, only want the winner of the race, why bother running?Sev, having worked in the Ivory Tower a while, discusses how this becomes particularly problematic in academia, when single women pursue advanced degrees, tenure, etc. valuing being a “professional” over dating/marrying/family. In their late 20s, early 30s, they’re “finally” ready to find a partner but even though they may have impressive professional credentials/job, this lofty perch they’ve reached perversely further limits an already-small pool of available men, since a woman usuallly wants a man at a higher level.Also working against them is the fact that after their mid-20s, their sexual desirability rapidly wanes. The few “desirable” males can pick and choose from the pool of women clamoring for his affections. And quite likely he’ll be choosing the newer models, not the 30-year-old who finally got her PhD in Gender Studies and tenure (or the equivalent Dreaded Private Sector position.) At University this would be particualy acute, since Mr. Professor of any age has a classroom full of girls not even old enough to drink yet to tempt him. Issues of fraternization aside, Prof. Studley has far greater numbers and quality to choose from in his classroom than what’s on offer in the faculty lounge.We label such career women AWFLs (affluent white female liberal); they are now, for all practical purposes, condemned to spinsterhood. Sure the have good salaries and perhaps even job security, but it’s unlikely they’ll ever find a man “worthy of them.” Several decades of living in an apartment with cats and a box of wine in the fridge is their fate.I haven’t even gotten into all the potential risks for those whodomarry. Divorce is an expensive proposition, especially for the man.These, and many other problems, no doubt contribute to the low birth rates.

                    This is a perfect summary of how things stand, and it’s not quite as new as many people think.  This ramped up very quickly after internet dating became something normal people could do without feeling like “losers”.  Women suddenly had the ability to see a big cross section of the men in the area, like shopping in an online marketplace, so naturally they’re not going to settle for less than Chad.  It’s not like one man “cost” them any more than another man.  If you can buy a new Ferrari for the same price as an F150, well, the choice is clear.I vacation in a place with a lot of old American and Canadian expats every Christmas.  Sometimes this topic comes up.  The older people can’t believe it’s real.  The women in particular are baffled – the last comment I recall was “sounds like a good way to wind up alone”.  Sure is – but they’d rather have nobody than settle.That said, I have an increasingly hard time blaming the young ladies – the young guys at my workplace appear to be about 80% dysgenic.  Maybe letting the “Chads” out there knock up all the women will be a corrective to species decline?

                        I’d say that’s changing. Reality has a way of seeping into our beliefs. After being out in the world a bit, a lot of women start to understand that the guy with his own business or a very high skill is a much better catch than the cubicle guy.

                        A tan used to be low status. It meant you were outside all day, instead of working in the fancy house. I think it’s more that labor jobs just aren’t the jobs women do, they don’t really have any access there (because they don’t have the type of strength and endurance it demands.)

                            The shift in attitudes took place during the 20th century. Murray’sComing Apartis one book that covered these societal changes. Until (say) the end of WW II, most men could make good money in the trades or at least many jobs that did not require professional certification. College or University was for those were (1) highly intelligent and (2) either came from money or could work their way through to pay tuition. (1) Is worth commenting upon: Until perhaps the early 20th centuryto enter high school required an exam, at least in a lot of States. How much fewer then, were the students worthy of an undergrad program? Overall the population was whiter, smarter or at the least, better educated. Not necessary in the “credential” sense, but what they learned and knew were more applicable to real-world employment.I digress; the point I wanted to make is that the as the value of a degree was realized, it was democratized. First the veterans got their GI bills, then student loans. Some States had/have cheap or even free tuition for some students. Couple this with financial incentives (e.g. big money = big business = the education business) and watered down standards and you arrive at where we are now, where any given “degree” is probably of questionable value. Sure there are still valuable degrees, but even those have been diluted in terms of intelligence and what the graduate has actually learned or done.So perhaps “the trades” is the place for men to seek. If you’re even an average plumber, carpenter or electrician, you will probably never lack for work and your skills are highly portable. Sure you won’t have women lined up at your door, but on the other hand maybe those wouldn’t be the best women for you.

                I’m in IT and am being rendered unemployable by the accelerating Indian infestation, which Trumpler seems intent on making 10x worse, and the fact that I’m a “seasoned professional”. Even today the age discrimination is pretty brazen in a lot of companies. If the company website has a staff photo that looks like that Jaguar commercial, obviously you should run. If it has a staff photo that looks like the senior class at the local high school, don’t even bother. To paraphraseAnimal Farm, some discrimination is worse than others.However, I’m trying to build up my side business and make it into something real. Basically, the only way I’d ever advise a young White man to go into this field would be if he has a very firm plan to start his own company and then be very careful about his hiring and partnership choices (wink, wink…). Small firms can get away with being “selective” this way simply because the libshit lawyers don’t see enough of a payday possibility in sending in a wammen or PoC as a stooge to create an AA case. As the company grows and matures though, it becomes harder to keep the diversity out. Maybe this is why people like Musk are “serial entrepreneurs” who keep founding and then selling companies.It’s definitely time for White entrepreneurs to copy the vile Pajeets and create loose networks of mutual support and referrals.

                The brother dated a Chinese gal this last year, from the one-child gen (she doesn’t understand “brothers and sisters”.)
Instead of dating sites, we could do like they do in China. Every Saturday in the public park are dozens of women holding up signs advertising what they have in assets, career, health, and other selling points.
This, in a country where 200 million men can’t find a wife, because it was the girls who got aborted. (In the olden times, girl babies were the ones left in the field, which led to the Boxer Rebellion.) Something is off over there.

            It is not easy to find a woman who wants a large family. It is also not easy to find employment that pays enough to support a large family on one income. Two income families mean one or two children max.

        There is a concerted effort by our rulers to limit all economic activity to cities. They want no rural population.  Travel through the Midwest, mlssouri,Kansas, Kentucky , and WVa. They are STUNNINGLY empty. At least away from the cities . In the cities they build enormous apartment complexes but no houses. The rural land is being bought up by ngo groups and made into “preserves” like black mountain Kentucky. Those preserves allow almost no public access. Not even camping or hiking. There is clearly large forces at work worldwide. The same thing is going on ic Canada, Brazil, Australia,and lots of other countries.  It’s almost like they want us to own nothing Ang eat bugs.

            This is a good reminder that our side should buy more rural land.  What’s stopping us from forming NGO’s to pool resources and buy land?  Land acquisition is a wise capital preservation strategy, especially considering the uncertainty related to the economy and the dollar going forward.

                Exactly.  Throughout history, land was the signature of true wealth.  Still is today.  The rich know this.  Whether they buy such directly (think Bill Gates) or indirectly (think Blackrock) the elites are hedging their bets.  However, land must be held and defended.  For that, the elites are dependent on us peons.   What Bill Gates buys can’t be moved and will be taken back when the time comes.

                    Yes. Someone recently put it this way. If you are a billionaire and you have a compound that is guarded by warriors, is it your compound or theirs. Of course, once they can do it with robots, they dispense of the loyalty and physical inferiority problem.
The praetorians were the kingmakers of Rome. Get good land and own it outright. Don’t be an island. Build community and networks and steward your posterity so they can be effective stewards across generations.

                        Just had a ‘neighbor’ (3 miles away on the other side of the paved road) call to make sure I am okay (with husband away for work and 8-10 inches of snow on the ground).  I am fine and accustomed to being rather independent, but it was also comforting to know that others were thinking of me.  My other sole legitimate ‘neighbor’ (maybe 1/3 of a mile away through the woods) brought me over a big bunch of kindling yesterday, which I definitely needed.  I’m an old lady who grew up in the ‘burbs and he’s been an outdoorsman all his life, but we’ve been there for him when he needed gas for his generator, etc.  Community is vital.

                    I wonder if it is even possible, C. I love the dissidents, I love their ideas about traditionalism and self reliance… but that comes along with a very, very rugged individualism that is a double edged blade. Sure… the classical dissident will function well on his own but by his very nature… organizing into a coherent functional social unit with such men is going to be a bear. They are not ones to put aside differences, bury the hatchet, let go of old grudges… and a lot of that is for the better, IMHO… but in the face of what’s coming… oh boy. If we ever DO see a ‘strong man” type leader, and he is of the wrong stripe… He will hunt down guys like us and pick them off one by one. Historically they go after the rural types first as Stalin did.We really, really need to get our shit together…

                    “What Bill Gates buys can’t be moved and will be taken back when the time comes.”
Exactly. The same applies to any land you intend to hedge your bets with. Most people have absolutely no idea, let alone a plan of how to do that. I’ve spent a lot of money on special forces type consultants, and summarizing their advice of how to hold onto your land is, “Don’t.”
Not that I intend to cut and run at first spark. But I have a more realistic understanding of when to run away from what they taught me about insurgencies.

                            Right. But how many more Ukrainians would be alive today if not for the anachronistic idea of holding onto the land at all costs? Western analysts were going on about how Ukraine was going to be able to fall back to a deeper line of defense, but it turns out only the Russians did that. When they retreated to the next line, they pulled out prepared range cards and unleashed holy hell on the Ukes.
Trading territory for men and materiel is a good idea if you have space to fall back to.

        Read a study couple days back that reported that 98% of the parents of U.S. daughters want their girls to ‘have careers’ and to ‘live independent financially’. That’s the plan in life: Don’t need no man.When I was a kid 70 years ago, most parents raised daughters to marry, to marry young, and to produce many wonderful grandchildren. That’s back when the nation actually worked.DIEversity hires, all, just like the Mayoress | PatriactionaryModern parents of the past half-century don’t raise daughters for marriage, but to have hard-charging careers while the government mandates the mass hiring and promotion of their daughters over males.‘That means the population collapse is most certainly do to a combination of things working in concert.’Uh huh.

                Childhood, especially for females, is extended ridiculously in America, and females marry and give birth far too late in their lives.  This is encouraged in every possible way by, well, most everybody.
This is a signature of a neo-matriarchal society, or simply a gynocentric one.

        We would be wise to not make the same mistake we make in all matters that led us to this precipice. That is to Universalize a problem. Below replacement fertility on its own may actually be healthy, though not without serious issues to address as we go through it. Our biggest problem is the invasion of our homelands and the ongoing cultural genocide against our people. Period. Full stop.Even saying that the Occident’s problem isn’t as bad as Asia’s is a big mistake. This is due to several factors, one of which is importing high fertility people. That is the problem not the solution. However, saying this supports the argument of the people who have committed this crime against us and want to increase its magnitude. Other factors are that some segments of European/Euro-Diaspora people are spiritually healthy and they are making the numbers look better in aggregate. Their numbers look fantastic and taking them away make the Occident’s look more like South Korea.Our prime objective is to preserve, reclaim, and/or carve out a homeland for our people. We are already a stateless people, and stateless people are ripe for abuse. The fertility crisis is a major problem and its biggest problem is a consumer business model and a political patronage system disguised as a public welfare program. Both are ponzi schemes and both have incentive structures that mean the powers that be will just be incentivized to import more human bodies to paper over the decline.Without a homeland, a job is slavery within a worker’s colony. Effectively that is what globalism has reduced us to. America is a set of colonies with various alien/external groups and countries extracting money and bringing it back to their vaults and extracting power and using it to extract more money from other remote colonies.Our biggest problem is getting to a state where we are no longer colonized. Be very careful not to use the fertility crisis as supporting argument for strengthening the hand of our colonizers.

        I haven’t had time yet to listen to the podcast, but the topic immediatly called to my mind the “Six Sirens of the Sexual Apocalypse,” identified by the blogger Chateau Heartiste years ago.  Here’s a list:“Again, Le Chateau was on top of all this years ago, when we proposed a sea change in the American cultural landscape heralded by the coming of the Four FiveSix Sirens of the Sexual Apocalypse:Effective and widely available contraceptives (the Pill, condom, and thede factocontraceptive abortion).Easy peasy no-fault divorce.Women’s economic independence (hurtling towards women’s economic advantage if the college enrollment ratio is any indication).Rigged feminist-inspired laws that have caused a disincentivizing of marriage for men and an incentivizing of divorce for women.Penicillin (reduced the cost of contracting STDs)Widely available hardcore porn.I added numbers five and six to the list of Sexual Apocalypse Sirens, because they seem to me just as important to understanding how the sexual market changed in the last fifty or so years.So, a crib sheet of quippy replies if you ever need it to send a feminist or manboob howling with indignation:1. The Pill2. No-fault divorce3. Working women4. Man-hating feminism5. Penicillin6. Porn”I may comment later after I have a chance to listen to the podcast, but I’ll bet Z-man touches on some of these factors.

        “One of the many strange things about this age is that the most urgent issue facing the developed world gets the least amount of attention. That urgent thing is the collapse of fertility in every country with indoor toilets. “Excellent to see this highlighted. And, yes, of course!Biologically, what would we think of a group of creatures who were given shelter, food, and even peace and prosperity – yet, given the choice – refuse to reproduce themselves? I think the biologists would assume that, despite appearances, there was something Very Wrong Indeed.I got interested in this stuff about 15 years ago, with an evolutionary psychology perspective. At the time, I was trying to understand why and how prosperous US Mormons *had been* able to buck the trend, and reproduce above replacement mormonfertility.blogspot.com. But in the  years since it is evident that Mormon fertility has *also* collapsed to well below minimum-replacement level, despite *massive* LDS church propaganda to try and maintain large families.My current tentative view to explain population collapse, is that it is biological (at root): i.e. that we are dealing with biological damage to the basis of reproduction which has a genetic basis in mutation accumulation.Accumulation of deleterious mutations is mostly due to the colossal reduction in human child mortality rates from about 60% to about 1%, operating over several generations – high child mortality having previously served as a selective sieve that filtered-out harmful mutations which spontaneously occurred each generation.Now these deleterious mutations mostly accumulate, generation upon generation.I think ZMan is already aware of this genetic interpretation of the Mouse Utopia idea, which was first suggested by Michael A Woodley of Menie; also picked up and extended by some of Michaels colleague’s such as Edward Dutton and me.I personally regard mutation accumulation as a major cause of the significant decline in intelligence over the past 150-200 years following the industrial revolution But I describe some other possible implications in this extended essay: mouseutopia.blogspot.com.One conclusion was that the first and most obvious effect of mutation accumulation would be damage to “social adaptations” especially reproductive instincts and sexual development.In a nutshell; mankind is stopping reproducing mainly because our sexual development, and instincts leading to reproduction, are being genetically disrupted, in a cumulative (generation by generation) way. This potentially explains the trend for ever-worsening subfertility across all cultures, societies, races, religions etc.This also explains the increasing rates of non-reproductive sexual preferences, identities, and practices. This is not just the high rate of “non-heterosexuality” – but also the focus on maximizing sex but without reproduction. “Doing what comes naturally”, is no longer biologically viable, because what is natural to us, is a consequence of genetic damage.This explanation is not, however, very popular’ because there is really nothing known that can be done to reverse it – things are already too late; symptoms of which, are (as ZMan said) that people are Just Not Interested in understanding the problem of subfertility, or do not regard subfertility as a serious problem (even though it leads, potentially via mutational meltdown, to human extinction).

            Separating physical intimacy from reproduction is a cornerstone of the transhumanist/depop plan.
The end goal is managed artificial reproduction, most likely in a cloning facility or warehouse of artificial wombs. Many sci-fi dystopias have covered this.

                I don’t really see it as a problem, but as amoral nature coming back to balance. More of a market correction than a crash.
Our overpopulation is a bubble, a surplus bubble; we’ve never had such surplus before.
The big mistake was well-earned Northern Tier achievements being given away for free to Southern Tier breeders.  That is how the wogs have always dealt with their environment, breeding too fast for it to kill them.  Now they’re spilling intoourpetri dish, that is the disruption.

            “In a nutshell; mankind is stopping reproducing mainly because our sexual development, and instincts leading to reproduction, are being genetically disrupted, in a cumulative (generation by generation) way. This potentially explains the trend for ever-worsening subfertility across all cultures, societies, races, religions etc.”Excellent point.  I would like to explore such at a more minute level.  We keep saying “collapse”, but what does that mean?  At the general understanding it means a birth rate of less than 2.1 offspring, but what of the mixture of mated pairs of humans in general?  Some have no offspring, some have 1, some have 3 or more.  Can we say that a woman who has one child or two children is a mutant of some sort?  Seems women—and men—can serve their maternal instincts with less than replacement level breeding.Is there some innate need for “normal” reproduction that should program a mating pair of humans to produce a magical number of offspring to maintain or increase the general population?  Is any mating pair of humans who does not reproduce until death or physical incapability a mutant of some sort?

        Population decline in developed countries is not a problem.  It should lead to better living with less congestion, pollution and crowding.  The problem is the owners of capital need more eaters to buy cellphones, fast food and pay rents, so they are importing the worst kind of humans to keep the “growth” going, in the process crapping up the place for the rest of us.Korea, China and Japan should do just fine, as long as they keep out the brown hordes.Europe is drowning under the brown wave.  Canada and the US are going under.  Who wants to bring children into a world being overwhelmed by Africans, Mestizos and Pajeets?

            “Korea, China and Japan should do just fine, as long as they keep out the brown hordes.Europe is drowning under the brown wave. Canada and the US are going under.”Exactly along my line of thinking.  Their population shrinks, but it maintains it IQ distribution.  The Smart Fraction remains intact to support and promote the society’s goals and welfare.  The West however imports low IQ muds who consume more from the general society than they produce.  The replacement of Whites shrinks the Critical Fraction and inevitably, the society reverts from a 1st class technological nation to a 3rd world nation which is the only type of nation supportable by such a population.You can see such occurring here.  The latest example being LA and their fires.  Little by little the mistakes and utter incompetence of their key leadership is being revealed.  The LA mayor does not understand what an Internet address is, nor did she think the situation was important enough to fly home immediately from junketing in Africa—her homeland.  The LA Supervisors cut the fire department budget last year.  It is rumored that failure to refillreservoirshas cause a water shortage for fire fighting.  The Fire Chief is a DIE appointee and utterly incompetent for the position—there is no shortage of her self congratulatory announcements of DIE efforts in her department.  The Governor is pathetic and more interested in a future political election to the Presidency than in the current crisis.Every news conference you see the swarm of brown faces appear among the elites in control.  That’s really all you need to know.  You can turn off the sound on the TV.  You’ll hear nothing but faux sympathy and platitudes.  Ever since I was a child one heard about CA leading the nation—environmental regulation, product ingredients regulation, and so forth.  Well now they lead the nation in decline from population replacement.

Those are the three truest lines I’ve read in a long time. Yes. Distance isn’t the solution but it is the only short-term defense. The rotten structure really is falling apart and the fires are the flashing neon sign of the upcoming salvage sale. There will be no TV to turn off soon enough. The salvage buyers know the market is offshore.

        There have been studies of other mammals that show the females simply stop reproducing when the environment reaches a saturation level.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/11/001128070536.htmFor humans, this is made easier by technology factors like abortion and chemicalization of the food supply. But the principle is the same.Population density seems to be associated strongly with declining fertility rates, with religiosity and social norms as moderating factors.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914431/I view the population decline as a good thing. I don’t worship GDP which depends on population growth – currently being achieved through mass immigration – to expand. Fewer people means more open space. Fewer highways. Cheaper housing with more land.I’m not a depopulationist in the eugenics sense. But I am the kind of guy who enjoys living outside of the city on a few acres whose neighbors are “way over there”. Suburban flight is just depopulationism by other means. People naturally seek lower density over time. Crowded cities are dirty, dangerous, and there’s too much competition for jobs and resources. As that becomes harder, biology kicks in.My hope is that as my three kids reach adulthood (they’re just getting into their 20’s) they’ll decide to move a little closer to home to settle down and raise a family. We put a lot of emphasis on family and we all spend a lot of time together. But I don’t operate under the illusion that we’ll have 15 grandkids. It’s just not where humans are heading.Seems to me that the fertility rates started to collapse when the human population crossed 3B.It started in the 1950’s:https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rateAt which time the population was about 3B.https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/There is only so much arable land to support humans.  Take that number, divide it into 3B and you’ll get a rough idea of the global population density at 3B population.  At 8B, you’ve more than doubled that peak density.  And population growth has cratered as a result.Back of the envelope: population rates are declining 0.5% every 25 years. So we’ll be at negative rates this century.And don’t think anyone is making a good case for why it should continue to increase.

            At the risk of being the eugenic depopulationist in the punch bowl, the problem is not so much the people who aren’t reproducing as those who are. Africa alone is projected to have 4-5 billion by the end of the century. Automation, AI and robotics will make the GDP growth argument irrelevant.

                That population has exploded mainly on the coat-tails of medical and agricultural advancements in the West, combined with access to clean water.  There is an end to that road at some point because eventually the West dies off and all those societies collapse in a second great die off.  Or, the West gets its act together, and stops subsidizing it.

            “Population density seems to be associated strongly with declining fertility rates, with religiosity and social norms as moderating factors.”Thoroughly confounded conclusion. India and China, and even Japan have been heavily (relatively) populated since recorded history. Their history is filled with evidence of population woes such as repeated famines and epidemics. Yet, their population increased century by century. It’s too simplistic a notion that at some magical and unproven density level, women stop reproducing.I would maintain there is, or has not, been any density level reached which causes decline in birth rate for humans. Rather, we have reached a scientific and sociological point where birth rate is controllable—by women. Further, I maintain that if such was the case 500 years ago, the population would have declined or stabalized then.

                “It’s too simplistic a notion that at some magical and unproven density level, women stop reproducing.”I can believe in two ideas:1)God puts limits on natural systems.  We have seen those systems have similar patterns of boom/bust2)Given a chart of estimated human population growth for the last 500 years, we’re reaching that limit.“Rather, we have reached a scientific and sociological point where birth rate is controllable—by women.”I cannot say it enough that feminism benefits men and not women. As proven by the obviously disturbed screeching harpies that push feminism, feminism at it’s core is about destroying healthy women.  Feminism insists on molding women into at best poor replications of men by playing on their fallen inner control freak.Further, in my limited survey of men, it’s women who like babies, not men. Men like women, women like babies and children, and children like hamsters. It’s the women, in their normal and healthy state, who would be gladly thrown up on for decades. Normal and healthy men quite often are mildly jealous of their own infants, even if they dote on them and are otherwise exemplary fathers and husbands. Hook up culture is far more destructive of women than men, etc, etc.If we have a reached a limit it’s because men are getting the milk for free on every level. They can have the sex without the infants, the civilization without having to lead it, money for toys well into adulthood, etc.

                    it’s women who like babies, not men.This part is correct, but I assert that women like *babies*, but they do not like *children*. It is men who are focused on putting in a lifetime investment in order to protect their legacy and have opportunities for mentoring and teaching, etc.Women want babies because they are cute. Women also want to be lazy and (above all!) unburdened by responsibility. Birthrates crumble when women have the ability to get their cuteness needs met by getting a puppy. It’s easier and far less responsibility than having another human being depend on you. Dogs and puppies for young women are not “practice” for having future babies — they are replacements.

                        This.  I like puppies and kittens as much as anyone – but they are still animals.  White babies and children matter – and I despise all those who unironically use the vile term ‘fur babies’ – even when referring to baby goats and cows.

                        “Women want babies because they are cute. Women also want to be lazy and (above all!) unburdened by responsibility. ”Men want women because they are cute. Men also want to be the lazy and unburdened by responsibility. Wanting babies that will yes eventually grow into children and then adults is how we keep the human race going. Can that impulse in women be disturbed, twisted, etc? Absolutely. I am not arguing against the fall in either sex. Why women want to be leaders has mostly to do with that fallen inner control freak issue. That’s why they don’t do it well either. Most healthy men don’t want leadership and therefore they do it much better. It’s just life on the planet.” Dogs and puppies for young women are not “practice” for having future babies — they are replacements.”In the married women I know, the puppies come last as a replacement for the last child. In the example I’m thinking of, a future good mother otherwise had welfare cases for pets which was given up for the babies. It’s not 100% that puppy will replace children, unless no opportunity comes along.But yes, pets are replacement children. You’ll get no argument from me there. How to fix it is above my pay grade. If I believe what’s in the OT, it’s not the first time the dogs have been replacement kiddos.“It is men who are focused on putting in a lifetime investment in order to protect their legacy and have opportunities for mentoring and teaching, etc.”By the time the infants reach teen years, a father’s investment in them in critical, regardless of sex. I think of primary Mom’s emotional investment era is from about age 0-10 and Dad’s is about 11 to forever. But there are plenty of sperm donors on the planet too unfortunately.

                        I honestly have not seen that – not in my own husband nor in numerous other men I’ve known.  I would counter that today’s women are jealous of their own children – instead of being the center of attention and feted as an expectant mother, suddenly they have to put in the work and the new infant is the center of attention.  I think that is behind the epidemic of post-partum depression as much as any other psychotropic cause.

                            ” I think that is behind the epidemic of post-partum depression as much as any other psychotropic cause.”OR that women are supposed to work away from home and be separated for long hours from their infants. It appears that post partum depression is a thing mostly to arise with expectation and/or need now for women to work.” I would counter that today’s women are jealous of their own children – instead of being the center of attention and feted as an expectant mother,”I’m sorry if you’ve never seen a husband jealous of his infant. It’s very real. That said, yes some silly and infantile women are indeed jealous of their infant. Narcisssism does that. My post was about healthy women.

                    ‘I cannot say it enough that feminism benefits men and not women.’Clearly you can’t say it enough, much as you repeat it.Collective female power has targeted boys and men in America for half-a-century . . . but it’s women that suffer most from it, eh?  lolThat’s like Hillary pronouncing that the main victims of war are women.  The men being dead and whatnot.  :O)‘As proven by the obviously disturbed screeching harpies that push feminism, feminism at it’s core is about destroying healthy women.’Feminism is a death cult and always has been throughout its ancient masks and iterations.  It is about destroying everything, including women.

                        The male part of the fall was a)falling and b)blaming that gosh darn woman for the problem, rather than take responsibility for it. Until men are ready to stop whining at women to stop for being women nothing will change. What I see your posts is “Women caused all these problems, they shouldn’t be in charge, and why won’t they let us be in charge??” Okay….do you see a problem there? The Taliban just took back over society without waiting for the women to get on board. They also didn’t blame women for their loss of control.Meanwhile, women aren’t suicidal in the same way that men can be. They are however drunk and unhappy. The loss of Christian marriage is about destroying women, not men. And again, the model under feminism is male and not female. Androgny involves a sort of a man, not a woman. I’m not going to go there that women are destroyed as social construct and men feel it the most. That’s just as ridiculous as the other way around.

                                It’s okay to blame women for everything, but when I point out that men might be part of this problem it’s “go away”.  Women can’t fix this for the men. The men need to fix it and do things they don’t want to do. In blaming women and claiming lack of agency, men become effeminate themselves.

                Rather, we have reached a scientific and sociological point where birth rate is controllable—by women.
This really is it in a nutshell. Declining birth rates corresponds much more closely to increases in women’s freedom than it does to any arbitrary metric of total population, population density, etc.

                    Women’s reproductive freedom simply gives them an easier tool to do that which they are already biologically prewired to do at certain levels of population.

I have backtracked and found an older article by a better man than me.  Very complete analysis of population fertility rate decline.  Easy to understand and full of graphs and citations.  Don’t take my conclusion above as a complete explanation.  However, the feminization of society *is* the essence of the problem as the article below aptly supports:

                Counter to that may be that some populations, such as China’s, follow a boom and bust model. Three times China has had up to a 90% population loss due to bubonic plague, the same three times that drove the Mongols west. What the Americas never recovered from.
Africa has not only had repeated plagues, but genocidal Bantus rampaging up and down the continent ever since some Egyptian nitwit sold them metal spearheads. Nobody should have to remind a European about population density (sewage laden water and plague rats, typhus in the 1910s-30s) and the Black Plague, either bacterial or bipedal!

                But they’re all cratering, too.  That’s my point.You’re thinking of the human population as defined by a bunch of completely arbitrary borders.  Planet earth is a sphere with a finite surface area to support human life.Your argument is like saying there’s tons of deer on that property over there and it’s a growing herd, but in my property it’s not, so it must be something to do with the boundaries.  But the reality of the overall herd is growing.  Mother Nature doesn’t obey property lines.The earth is a self contained biosphere.  We’re on a space ship and only the resources we have on board (other than heat and light) to sustain us.  You have to think of human population as a global phenomenon.My theory is that the PLANET has a finite ability to support human life.  And then, combine that with the biological realities of herd population regulation.We’re all deeply connected to the rhythms of the planet.  God gave us dominion over it.  He didn’t make us separate from it.

            Population decline can most definitely be a ‘good thing,’ provided it’s the non-Whites who stop spreading across the earth like locusts. “People naturally seek lower density over time.”  Uh, you missed a key modifier there – White people are the ones who seek space and privacy and nature.  Not blacks, and certainly not east or south Asians.

                That only stops when we decide to stop sharing the bounties of our culture in terms of agriculture, medicines, and fresh water.  But I don’t see that happening any time soon.  Most of the population explosion in those parts of the world comes down to Western technology…the natural biological barriers were knocked down by technology.

        Although there may be multiple causes, some of them are a lot more obvious than others. E.g. birthrates have been generally falling since the IR, but it really fell off a cliff in the 60s after hormonal birth control was invented. Adding abortion without the father’s consent basically put women in 100% control of reproduction, and we’ve seen how they act when that is the case. Why would you want to give up the free infinite attention from male suitors in your 20s just to have 1 male giving you attentionwhilebearing the burden of pregnancy? The answer is you wouldn’t. And as anybody who has opened tiktok can attest, women crave attention above all else, and as long as they are getting it from random guys on the street constantly that’s all they really want.Then there are various aspects of feminism including corporate quotas, the ability to sue based on Title IX of the CRA for not hiring enough women, and welfare for single-mothers, which has helped eliminate the natural male role as the provider. Studies have shown that when the man in the couple earns less the woman herself leaves to find someone who makes more than her. So even from basic female psychology you can’t have a society with both a sustainable birthrate and women with jobs/education. What’s hilarious is that the academy admits this is true. Google for any study about fertility rates and education and you will see the correlation that more female education leads to a reduced birth rate in developing nations!Finally the family courts essentially make it illegal to have a family. She can divorce you at any time for any reason, take half your stuff, and in the worst case your house as well. (From my experience talking to other men this is usually triggered by her friends or family telling her to do it as opposed to her own action. Maybe the Taliban are onto something with the keeping-women-in-the-home-idea?) Then you get to play cuckhold simulator, paying alimony and child-support while she lives in your house with another dude. In other words, getting legally married is providing the male with no legal benefits and only legal costs. So why would they do it?There’s also the media, the withholding of information about pregnancy and fertility including the extreme difficulty women over 30 often go through to have more than 1 child. The constant girlbossing narratives in movies, telling women they need to have careers because men are deadbeats, etc. Other posters above have talked about these more subjective factors. They can be pretty far out there though. I heard one podcaster propose that women were limiting their children to &lt;2 because only 2 children’s car seats can fit inside a normal sedan. The point here is that while both men and women have issues and problems, it is clearly the women more than men that are causing the immediate ones (as is very likely from the fact women are initiating 80% of the divorces). I don’t expect these problems to be addressed since you would first need a homeland to do it, but I hope this is a clear explanation.

            “…welfare for single-mothers, which has helped eliminate the natural male role as the provider. “No general objection to the observation, but the exclusion of children in the equation is to not understand the situation completely.Welfare was sold as not for the mother, but for the children—the mother was a live-in babysitter.  Indeed, look at most all these unfair situations you decry and you can see it’s the children in the marriage that produces much of the unfairness.  A couple with no children can divorce without many of the problems of settlement we hear of—especially if the woman continued to work and maintain an independent income and the marriage is of a relative short duration.Perhaps another aspect in the declining birthrate?

        I don’t know if “My Posting Career” or MPC is still around, but a poster called Pleasureman distilled most of the problems down to something he called SCALE. Size, Complexity, Atomization, Liberalization, Elitism. It functioned as a good explanation for all societal problems, but it definitely applies to our declining birth rates. Communities break down when you expand past Dunbar’s number at around 100-250. You can’t have high trust with people you don’t know intimately without strict reciprocal laws that guarantee some level of safety. The complexity of our society further drives the codification and bureaucratization of things since we have a very delicate machine that relies on international shipping of materials. A factory burning down in China might have some serious consequences for people in America.Atomization feeds off both of these things. If you can’t readily trust people around you (especially when the laws designed to preserve peace and order are enforced anarcho-tyranny style), you isolate and interact with only people you can really trust. Your home becomes your fortress that you sally forth from to go accomplish tasks rather than a domicile that’s a larger part of the community around you. Arguably, many Americans have always had a smidge of this kind of mentality due to living on the frontier with the savages, but it’s gotten so ubiquitous that during COVID, as you observed, many people adapted to living in their castles without missing a beat. The atomization plays into childrearing because, even in Northwestern Europe, nuclear families relied on external support from friends and family to raise families. You had grandparents watching grandkids and formal and informal community organizations designed to watch over and inculcate kids. As much as I hate leftists who use the phrase as an excuse to indoctrinate kids, it does take a village to raise a child. We’ve seen what one or two parents and an iPad does, and it’s not pretty.Liberalization is pretty simple. It’s tied in with both individualism and the loosening of traditional virtues. “Don’t settle down and have kids until you’re 30, maybe even 35. You’re young and it’s the best years of your life. Go out and travel and enjoy doing all of the things you can’t do with kids (trust me, I learned just how many of them there are when I started having mine). Kids create worries that don’t exist when you’re single, dating, or in a DINK marriage. Also, it’s your duty as an individual to be educated, have a good job, and have reasonable financial certainty before you have kids. Try and get as much pleasure out of life before you decide to have kids.” Of course fertility problems rear their ugly heads for those who don’t get sucked into the hedonistic childfree method of life. Nature won’t be mocked. The religious voices that would condemn any of this stuff have been silenced or made complicit in the “I’m ok you’re ok” Jesus who just wants everybody to be happy and nice to one another.Elitism is a bit tougher to apply directly to the antinatalism of our age, but it’s largely through societal pressures getting beamed down from “thought leaders” and media. Everything from the “environmental issues of overpopulation” to people’s eyes glazing over as they repeat “I don’t want to bring kids into a world this horrible.” Large families are demonized in media and usually depicted as uneducated morons who couldn’t figure out family planning or as cultish weirdos who have “fetishized” the act of procreation. That last phrase really sums it up. If you have sex for the reason lemurs, lions, and our forebearers have for millennia, you’re the weird one. The elite promote a view of sex that turns it into a non-narcotic recreational drug. Its just part of the bacchanalia, and kids are up there with STDs as one of the unwanted consequences.

            It isn’t so much that ittakesa village to raise a child, but more that the villagewillraise your child.  The village – i.e., culture –  in which your child is raised will have the most influence, be it a small farming community or the unbridled internet.  Best to make sure it is a good village.

        Z is right that this is a complex problem with several causes, but at the top of the list is women’s rights. Rich country, poor country, urban, rural, black, white, when you give women the right to education, to work and to contraceptives, birth rates collapse.That’s big reason why people don’t like to talk about the issue much or if they do, they don’t want to look at a key cause . . . because that would mean talking about women’s rights in a negative way. I’ve watched videos and read articles about the fertility collapse and they either don’t mention women’s rights or dance around it.

            Better to have a ruined country, better to present a hundred reasons for birth collapse, rather than face the plain truth: feminism — so greatly beloved by governments, colleges, media, corporations, and the parents of daughters — is a death cult. Plain and simple. Nations that adopt it fail and fail hard.
And feminism is America’s national religion. Don’t even think of trying to tell me its Jesus and Christianity.  Women long ago took the place of God in the U.S.

                        Golden, my man. I do see blacks along with their intended successors trannies starting to fade somewhat as the stars of the Progressive Stack, but as long as the rapes are confined to white women and girls (and they are the main target obviously), rape will remain a regular crime. If tranny rape exclusively becomes an issue, the “hate” modifier might be deployed. Maybe.

(Sure, explaining women’s increasing unhappiness is probably more complicated than that, but the previous sentence is fun to say to liberals.)
As untrustworthy as science and science reporting are, they seem to always say that, as each decade since the 1960s passed, women have become more miserable and on more psychiatric drugs.

                    Over the long haul maybe. But in her 20s and 30s, nothing, and I do mean nothing, can compare with living the sluts in the city lifestyle. There is nothing else anybody can offer a woman, ever, that can compare to how good she has it then. The whole damn world is her oyster at that point.She gets whatever she wants. And thanks to cosmetic surgery and ubiquitous gyms, the wall comes later and later. A lot of women have been able to extend this into their 50s.

To be fair, although I don’t find religion convincing, religious people can explain this as the power of Satanic inversion.  Good point, my friends.

            Feminists are dumb and annoying.  And the courts are awful to men.  But I have a feeling that most of this is driven by economics and children now being a liability.  Japan has women’s rights but not like we do. And their fertility is worse.  Yemen is the most anti-feminist country on Earth and has a fertility of 3.72. Sounds high but it’s come down from 8.0 in the mid 1990s.  Countries like Nigeria are sky high because they are stupid ignorant backward people.  We need to focus on lowering their rate.

                Japan isn’t feminist in the standard Western way, but in the fundamental way: Women consider men a lesser species, and the regime has a woman’s mind.Famous example: The idea that women need their own train cars, to shield them from thephysical predation of Japanese men(imagine),is literally hysterical. Nothing in reality justifies it, and it never did. Thechikanwas a media-induced hallucination. But there the cars all are—famouslyare, symbolizing the men of the country. Everyone knows them.To most of the living population, they’ve always been there. They’re an immortal truth. Conservatives invent conservative reasons for them to exist, but that’s not what they symbolize, not the story they tell. They’re alie about men. Propaganda in steel.I’ve heard one Japanese person objection to them, ever. A local female sex creep drunkenly complained to me that since she was a child she’s been trying summon the legendary train molesters to grope her, but it never works because they don’t exist.They exist now, presumably, since their government has unleashed the Indians against the people.

        When was the last time you met a woman proclaiming that her dream is to have a big family?
Actually, I once worked for a large corporation where we did the “where do you see yourself in 5 years” exercise. A female colleague, 23 years old, said that she wants to start a family and eventually have 5 children. She left the company one year later to do the eat pray love thing in Asia. Today, she’s in her mid 30’s, with no kids.

            Most people don’t know this, but the exotic “lovers” found in Eat Pray Love and How Stella Got Her Groove Back were both hedging on a green card. When they got their cards, they immediately filed for divorce. If I recall correctly, both men were gay. There are no happy endings for naive leftwing women in real life.

                It didn’t help that she was surrounded by a large number of very thirsty simps who would do anything for her (this was at a tech company). Being in an environment like that can’t be good for mental health, nor lead to an accurate world view.
Simping is a menace.

                    It is a virtual impossibility for anyone who is not an attractive woman to see the world as an attractive woman does. And vice versa. Because she is treated differently. Always has been, always will be. Regardless of prevailing norms, government regimes, etc.

            My daughter and fiancée were planning a large family. A year ago October that came to a screeching end in a bunch of twisted metal in the ditch.
There are a lot of her acquaintances who desire large families. Most of them I doubt will follow through. More to the point, find anyone crazy enough to follow through with. We’ll see.

        I’ve talked to people about how South Korea has basically decided to genocide itself thanks to not having babies. They don’t really get it, or choose not to get it. The obvious implication of this – that feminism allows women to end civilization and end their people, if they so desire – seems too horrifying and too shattering to the liberal consensus to contemplate.

All of this fretting about demographics is really about our worshiping of the economy gods and the truly sacrosanct GDP along with Ponzi based retirement programs.  We have to sacrifice to appease the economy gods.  This is also why we are wrecking our nations with third worlders, to appease the GDP/Economy gods.

        SS Africa is the only region defying the trend. What will Minnesota look like in 50 years after the swamping of the native pop. by the high time preference hordes? Bantus, Somalis, etc. are bad at debt management. That’s a huge problem combined with the general decline in population through a lower overall TFR. There just won’t be enough quality people to repay the high debt burden we face as a society. At some point it’s all going to collapse in on itself.

                Part of the reason is liberal women like Melinda Gates desperately pushing birth control and feminism on the women there.  They are having some success at lower birth rates rapidly, who knows what will happen as this progresses.

        I think that all your items are contributing factors and that it is a multi-factorial problem, but I think there is another major contributor that you allude to some of its effects at times but don’t specifically mention, which is feminism.  Socially this is a huge contributor to the changing social norms that you talk about some.  It is hammered into women to seek first an education and career.  This is a primary driver of the marriage age being pushed later and later.  When coupled with steep decline in fertilty by the time a woman hits her 30’s, it makes it more difficult to have many children, even if desired.When younger the biological imperatives aren’t as strongly felt in women, and the you go girl boss feminism seems to make a lot of sense.  But when biological desires become more apparent in their late 20’s and early 30’s, both finding a quality mate and having children both have become more difficult.Even as an older Xer Christian couple, neither who were opposed to marrying relatively younger or to having children, we unfortunately fell prey to this.  We got married right at 30 and waited a couple of years to start trying to have kids.  After many years, we finally had one child, though both of us would have liked more.  Even in the church, which is generally more pro-child as you note, never did anyone in our lives bring up the timing priority of marriage, or trying to have childeren sooner rather than later.  All the emphasis from parents, pastors, and other Christians was all more from a feminist viewpoint.Again, I think this combines with all the other factors you discuss, but I also think it’s a large driver in its own right.

            Another factor in that is a general frowning upon age gaps in couples.  It would make biological and economic sense for a 35-38 year old male to have an early to mid 20s wife, allowing for both family formation and sustenance.

                That was more common in Mom’s day (born in 1916), the man was expected to be established, the girl an “old maid” if she wasn’t married by 18. Nobody looked twice at married 14 year olds, or at 14 year old workers with a full-time job, either.
Civilization used to be structured around a female’s age, not a male’s.Specifically, around puberty, and all that came with it.
Even the Dick van Dyke show in the 60s had an episode where his wife (Mary Tyler Moore), admitted that she had lied on the marriage certificate, she was really only 15.

                    Alzaebo, you’ve hit upon the essence of the problem—marriage!
I’ve cited this above, but this article is worth reading:
https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/the-baby-boom?utm_source=publication-search&amp;utm_medium=email
We have empowered women so much that the not longer need to marry.  Marriage is the environment for creation of family and children.  The article in essence states the case for population decline based upon marriage collapse.  Well worth a read.

                True enough. Unfortunately in all too many cases it also makes economic sense for the wife to divorce hubby in her 30s while she’s still somewhat marketable. Sure, the kids aren’t grown and will suffer, but who cares? This scenario is especially alluring if Ex-to-Be can get a good settlement and maybe even alimony. Sometimes she even gets the house and the kids.Or perhaps more realistically, and this would mirror most of the case I’ve known in my lower-middle class experience, is that a couple calls it quits thinking it’ll be an improvement but they both wind up worse off, at least in economic terms.

        There is never a right time to have a baby. Women rate higher in neuroticism, thus giving women control, any control limits fertility.
Now what does control mean? Studies have been done and comparisons between countries made. Its not abortion, it’s not free childcare, it’s not the civil rights. It’s the mere knowledge that fertility can be controlled: timing sex around fertility cycles and pull out game.
Any kind of sex education beyond it’s God’s will and His alone and humans go extinct.

        A TFR of 2.1 (or 2.2, as Z says) isn’t the whole story. In fact it is – almost literally – half the story.If a woman has her 2.1 kids by twenty, and her children follow the same time frame, then said woman will be a grandmother by 40, a great grandmother by 60, and quite plausibly a great great grandmother by 80. Ok, so what? Well, if another woman has her 2.1 kids around 35, and her children follow the same time frame, then said women will be grandmother at 70, and long gone by the arrival of her great grandkids.TFR is still at 2.1 or whatever. But a whole generation is missing.

            There is something really weird going on.  My sister has 5 kids.  Two are married.  No grandkids.  I think one is gay, just not openly, and the one girl is just a sad, confused, feminist bi just to piss of her mom.  It defies all logic.  Dad is a combat Marine who announced last Fall after 35 years of marriage he just doesn’t want to be married any more.  35 years down the tubes for my sister who did the stay at home mom thing while dad went to war.  What should be the start of her golden years and maybe some grandkids to enjoy is now her starting a career doing insurance adjuster stuff and figuring out where she’s gonna live this summer.  That’s just effed up.The older two boys got it figured out.  But they figured it out so late that they’re now married in their mid-30’s with wives who are past the best years for making babies.  Happy but childless.It’s just absolutely weird.

        I’m going to be superstitious here and blame Mother Nature. Nature always finds a way. Respect the Dao. Soon after hitting 5 billion people in 1987, we started getting busts all over. This is merely some dormant program that gets activated when the human population can’t cull itself through natural disasters, pestilence, and war. I suspect the rat and cockroach population has a similar dormant program.

        Excellent point on restaurant food.  Even the ones that are “family owned” that people are convinced have better food get most of what they serve off the same truck that stops at Chili’s and Cracker Barrel. The main difference is in the price with possibly slightly higher quality people doing the cooking and prep.

            I’m not sure if that’s true. Large restaurant chains have very refined and customized supply chains. They don’t buy ground beef. They buy ground beef already shaped and sized for their specific menu items. For example.

                Fast food places do. I see the same trucks from major food service companies like Sysco outside causal dining chains like Applebees and locally owned places.  I’m sure certain items come standardized, but most of the food comes from the same place.

        One major reason is that nobody wants to subject their potential offspring to the soulless, inhuman future the controllers are implementing.
Another major reason is that the Earth is a very large, yet ultimately finite system. The problem is that the limits of that system are not clearly knowable by our crude human perception and tools.

        As I understand it, the human population was between 1m and 10m at the start of the Holocene. Even 2000 years ago I think the human population was only around 200m. Human crossed the 1bn mark in around 1840 (I think). We’re certainly in overshoot territory right now. India and China are in extreme overshoot territory, and probably so is Europe. Europe’s natural carrying capacity is probably around 50m-70m. It’s got maybe around 450m or thereabouts today.

How do you estimate these numbers? And how do you define carrying capacity?
I think the biggest tragedy is that people of European heritage used to be close to half of the world’s population and now are at maybe 10%. Any decline in global population must be carefully managed so that we are not eaten by the zombies, whose populations have exploded in the second half of the 20th century. Minimum requirement for careful management is to not let the zombies in your home.

                “I think the biggest tragedy is that people of European heritage used to be close to half of the world’s population and now are at maybe 10%.”It was around one third in 1900. It’s less than 10% now. As for where I got the figures, it’s from a number of sources over the years which I don’t remember, but the numbers have somehow stuck to my memory.The reasons for the population explosion probably lie with effective methods to decrease infant mortality. And also, more efficient methods of agriculture and animal husbandry. Again quoting from memory. Famines, pestilences like the plague, and childhood diseases were effective ways of culling the human population and keeping it in check.With regard to carrying capacity, it’s the number of people the land can support. The British Isles had a population of around 1m at the time of the Roman invasion. Maybe around 3m in the era of Queen Elizabeth I. Around 15m in 1800 — where we’re already at the limits of carrying capacity. 40m in 1900. To support this large domestic population, an empire was needed where the colonies would send back resources to the motherland. Without the empire, things became hard. Just like they did with Austria at the end of WW1, when the Austro-Hungarian empire was no more. Britain today is in a crisis of population overshoot, even without the millions of immigrants. Likewise for France but less acute because it more arable land per capita.

                    I don’t think it’s useful to calculate carrying capacity of a continent based on ancient methods of agriculture, famines and plagues. We don’t need to go all the way back to those times. I certainly don’t want to. We need to find the right balance.

                He just makes numbers up.The Roman Empire had 60 million at its peak and that didn’t cover the whole of Europe; and they certainly did not have the most efficient agricultural system.

                    Well, a quick Google search reveals this from a Wikipedia article (which I was hitherto unaware of):“Published estimates for the 1st century (“AD 1“) suggest uncertainty of the order of 50% (estimates range between 150 and 330 million). Some estimates extend their timeline into deep prehistory, to “10,000BC”, i.e., theearly Holocene, when world population estimates range roughly between 1 and 10 million (with an uncertainty of up to an order of magnitude)”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_populationAs for the other numbers I give — *shrug* — do your own homework. I’ve given ballpark estimates and don’t have any ego invested in themAlso, with regard to the Roman empire at its peak, remember that it covered a swathe of the Middle East and Northern Africa as well as the more populated parts of Europe.

                This is so true.  Also, we must define carrying capacity carefully.  It means many things to different people.  A Europe with 50M people would seem to assume most folk are subsistence farming.  I have no inclination to return to scraping the earth with a stick for 14 hours a day while fearing death through disease or other calamity of Nature.

I have no inclination to return to scraping the earth with a stick for 14 hours a day while fearing death through disease or other calamity of Nature.”I agree with you in principle. But. Modern agriculture and animal husbandry is energy intensive (tractors, fertilisers, trucks to transport food) and requires an industrial base (to manufacture said tractors, trucks, and fertilisers and provide electricity, gasoline, and water on a large scale). How long this stays in place I have no idea. When it goes, we’ll have to tighten our belts. This would be going back around 15 years but I recall an animated discussion on the long defunct “Doomstead Diner”, where the general consensus was that the best we could hope for (in the future) was the Roman empire.

                Yes. One of the interesting things about the recent H1B spat was the viciousness of the Indians and their hatred for Americans. It was only a few decades ago that they were going to mass starve. It was American and European technology, AND GENEROSITY, that allowed them to move out of starvation and go through a massive population boom.
That is conveniently forgotten. We need to remind people of that to combat the colonizers deserve colonization myth.

        Well that was a helluva good kick off for the new year, Z. And you’re right… there’s a lot of stuff going on here.I am not one for preachin’ and speechin’… but the fella out at the little chapel in the country had a good point as he was going over the Exodus, and how the Egyptian  pharoah was getting hit with plague after plague for refusing to release the jews … and he just keeps doubling down on stupid.Our preacher said we too live in an age “where the locust are eating everything that is left…” I personally think God has abandoned us until we come to our senses… but whadda I know? God does not talk to me, and I am lucky if I can see His hand move from time to time.We’re seeing it everywhere – in California where all the money that supported the fail safes for fire prevention was systematically cut… and where did all that money go? The money sent to the ‘Kraine is gone and no one knows where that money is either…and our politicos stare stupidly back at us from the television and computer screens and just shrug. And… we let them do it. The locust swarm us and we just stand aside and let them do what they do.Another theory I like is that we are all basically chickens with a bigger brain box. If you look at modern poultry birds, they have been engineered from the ground up to eat, lay eggs, get fat and get butchered. The breeding instinct has been bred right out of them and if they were all magically released into a plentiful environment they’d be extinct within 2 years. The males would still breed the females… but the females won’t nest and raise a clutch of eggs. Perhaps we inadvertently domesticated ourselves beyond our ability to reproduce?That was a good show today – have yourself a great weekend.

                        I know the two biggest burn areas quite well and the third in the Hollywood Hills as well.   Family and friends in the Palisades, used to live downhill from the Altadena fire and worked a block away from Runyon Canyon.   Pacific Palisades is a mix of neighborhoods with a core of neighborhoods built a hundred years ago on smallish lots not different from a Midwestern neighborhood of a century ago.  It’s probably not insignificant that it was built around a Methodist camp site and the most prominent church is the Methodist church.   My in-laws live there and there is a little strip about 3 blocks by 2 blocks on a bluff overlooking the high school that was spared while everything else in the area burned.The other folks I know there are doctors, but my nieces had hollywood star’s kids as friends growing up.   The neighborhood was great as I recall — spent every July 4th there for the parade and the fireworks  display.   Despite no doubt having a bunch of spoiled degenerates, there are plenty of salt of the earth Americans, too.I like to hate on “Hollywood” too, but I know too many real people there.  Who knows?  Maybe some of them are reading this

                            Pacific Palisades was one of my wife’s childhood homes. The people who have been there for a long time are often salt-of-the-earth middle class types who bought there before the explosion of home prices. The actors and other rich people came in later and drove the price of real estate through the roof.

            Since the feminists are bugged-out terrified of saying one word about men in women’s bathrooms and sports, they will be stricken with catatonia if we should bring up fertility testing (for both) or stillbirth/miscarriage rates.
Their Handmaid’s Tale fantasy is about to come true, and not in a nice way.From “Me So Hot” to “hunting the unvaxxed for harvest.”

            The mRNA platform had never been tested on more than a relative handful of human subjects prior to the 2020 “vaccine” rollout. Short-term trials, some serious side effects or lacks of efficacy found, zero long term safety data. What could possibly go wrong?

        absolutely fascinating topic, thanks Z Man. Honestly, this could use a part II it’s that interesting and I think you could go easily go into further depth for more material. the deracination alone is something that was observed in “Bowling Alone” and has been a topic of interest of mine since. So many layers to unpack here.I’m dubious on the premise that we must continuously grow the population. Why? To prop up the ponzi economic schemes our empire thrives on? If the population shrinking helps usher in the collapse of this economic zone masquerading as a country, then maybe it’s something we should be applauding.

            This. It would be interesting to know the fertility rate of women born *in* the Faroe Islands. My guess is the number is abysmal, as any reasonably attractive young female immediately leaves the “boring” islands for Europe at the first chance she gets.

        The chemical pollution theory would make more sense if millions of couples out there were trying, and failing, to have children. But we don’t see that. Something else is afoot.I grew up in a typical American community in the 1970s, when we consumed all kinds of rubbish, from ‘Hamburger Helper’ and Chef Boyardee ravioli, to Hi-C and Sugar Smacks; our mothers used Crisco religiously, as the ‘modern and healthy’ alternative to those awful animal fats that grandma and grandpa (who died in their 80s and early 90s) grew up on. Yet here we are, the hated boomers, living long and living strong.Oh and we had kids too. Plenty of them. Not like our parents, mark you, but enough – I think – to keep the ol’ world turning.All in the thermonuclear age. Or, if not the thermonuclear age, the ‘population bomb’ age, the ‘soylent green’ age, the ‘Future Shock’ age, the ‘peak oil’ age… onward we went, apparently, into a dark and disturbing future.Which is now here: 2025. The very sound of ‘2025’ seems apocalyptic if you grew up on the bleak prognostications of (say) 1972…So here I am trying to find the point. Humanity has bred offspring under generally awful conditions for, like, forever. No one knows what the TFR was for European women during the Black Death (1347-1349), but at a guess it sure beat South Korea’s today.Long and short: to blame pollutants for the global TFR crisis is like blaming lead water pipes for the fall of the Roman Empire.

            I’m not suggesting microplastics (or whatever) has caused total infertility in any large numbers. Or even small numbers. AFAIK no one is. But it could be reducing fertility and conception at the margins. Leading to, say, 2 conceptions where there used to be 3. And then 1 where there used to be 2. Fewer accidental pregnancies. Indeed, teen pregnancy has been dropping relentlessly since the 1990s. And I’m pretty sure it’s not because our culture became less sexualized.

                The argument is that micro plastics are pseudo estrogens.  So they turn men into soy boys and make women crazy.   It is not that they cause the loss of an otherwise viable pregnancy – but that they forestall hormonally driven sexual activity that leads to pregnancy.

i guess you’ve never heard of the billion dollar &lt;i&gt;invitro fertilization&lt;/i&gt; industry?
Or world wide decline in testosterone levels.
Or noticed the steep decline in “unplanned” pregnancies.
Or seen the self reported sexual activity for young adults is less than half the level of forty years ago.

        I haven’t listened to the podcast yet in case I’m just repeating Z, but my take is that it’s the mouse utopia problem.  You put people in an alienating industrial society and everyone is living a pointless existence just like Uncle Ted warned us about.  The only mortal threats we commonly face in the developed world are diseases of obesity, it’s probably impossible to starve to death in the United States, and with no purpose in life for most people they just start acting like the crazy mice in the experiment, endlessly preening themselves and not having babies.

        China mandated abortions in the One Child era. Women were dragged from their homes and given abortions in mobile abortion trucks. (They also have mobile death penalty vans)  I have heard that China has hundreds of thousands and possibly even millions of “Black” people, which means they were born outside of the authority’s knowledge and so don’t exist on paper.   This same government is still in power and will, in due time, outlaw birth control and  abortion and may even mandate children.It is likely, IMHO, that if this were to persist, our leaders will do the same thing along with outlawing abortion.  This seems unthinkable now, but when things change, things change.  What is unthinkable becomes common sense.  Just 5 years ago, governments around the world did what was till that point, unthinkable and ordered lockdowns and banned gatherings.  China led the way in this by welding people into their buildings.

                AFAIK (I’ve never read the book), the women who carried babies in the Handmaiden’s Tale were the special women chosen for reproduction who were hot, had great genes, smart and no hereditary diseases.
All these fat ugly feminist imagine (well, fantasize) they will be the designated carrier of the next generation with some hot alpha doing the impregnation.  They will be just as barren as their sisters of today.

        It has been assumed, because history seems to confirm it, that in good times people tend to have more childrenOr maybe this assumption remains true, but an economy that makes supporting dependents on one income nearly impossible, that inflates the price of housing assets so much that few young people can afford any kind of long-term housing stability, and that requires young people to spend a majority of their most fertile years “in education” in order to (maybe) attain wages above subsistence-level is not, in fact, an actual “good time”, regardless of what “line goes up” on government crafted “statistics” purports to say?

        People had lots of kids in the past because it made economic sense. 99% of people lived on farms and they needed help.  Children were feeding chickens and fetching water from a young age.  Children used to be an asset. Now they are a liability.  That sums up why we don’t have as many kids anymore. Our ancestors weren’t more moral than us and we aren’t a bunch of hedonistic wretches. The profit and loss calculation changed.  From what I can see, that’s what’s driving it.

        While I assume environmental factors are important, I think the rest of that is mostly summarized to outlook. Belief that your children can have a better life than you did.That, I think, is why so many boomers are basket cases — they had the whole duck and cover drilled into them from early childhood. Just as children today say they fear climate change, boomers had the impression that the world was going to end tomorrow. My generation was scarred by the probably mostly apocryphal stories of Grandma having to subsist on cat food. You can fill in whatever your teachers and peers used to terrify you, but the last generation that might possibly not be scarred by world events like that might be those born in the late 19th century. Their fears were mostly those that we evolved with, and had developed a culture around accepting reality. Things like deadly childhood illnesses just were. Cuts that got infected were deadly.I know we put off kids for way too long because I honestly believed all the people saying how expensive they were. Absolute hogwash. This myth persists to this day — my son had been brainwashed by his peers into thinking kids were too expensive until he had his first.Upshot is that I think it’s more correct to think that TFR is more a function of optimism. Between all the propaganda and psyops, and decline of society and religion, plus largely manufactured global crises that we now hear about 24/7, what kind of vile person would damn an innocent to that kind of existence? Look where the fertility rates have not collapsed — largely those with a positive outlook on the future.

        “This flies in the face of what we think we knew about biology. It has been assumed, because history seems to confirm it, that in good times people tend to have more children, while in bad times they limit their children.”I believe this common explanation to be a misinterpretation of statistical cause and effect and basic history. First aspect, people did have/conceive *more* children before the IR. However, people were able to raise to adulthood *fewer* children. Therefore had a higher fertility rate to make up for a 50% childhood death rate of the time. Second aspect, after the IR, and especially with developing understanding of health and disease, the childhood death rates began their long decline—negating the need for high birth rates to ensure/secure a follow-on generation to care for the parents in old age. Third aspect, Feminism—coupled with birth control—starting in the 60’s—which allowed choice wrt conception on the part of the woman.The above is a more complete explanation of our current plight rather than the simplistic “good times, bad times” scenario—which was never a complete/thorough explanation.

            Also, as already mentioned above, and echoes what I’ve read about European economic history: In agrarian or feudal system, on the average a child was net benefit to a family. Even in early Industrial Revolution, they could be sent to labor in a factory all day. It’s not easy to disentangle causes vs.. Effects, and my recalled source didn’t make any such claims. A reasonable guess would be that the equation turned (that a child becomes a net liability, on average) in parallel with restrictions on child labor and compulsory school attendance. How are you going to keep ‘em down on the farm, once they’ve gotten a diploma and can make more money in the big city?Although just my hot take, I suspect the change (to kid being a net negative) happened by turn of 20th century, due mostly to economic, technological improvements, and not (directly) to women’s liberation from traditional roles, as that was still a generation or two in the future.

            Aren’t the Amish loosing a lot of people though?  Their birthrates may be good, but a lot of their children leave the sect.  Plus, modernity is bleeding into their community.  They use heavy equipment, power tool, trucks,  even landlines and cell phones for work. They’ve carved out a special exception for work.  Special exemptions rarely remain confined to the original exception.  When they cannot get ice in summer, they will probably run generators (most of them have generators in their homes for charging their power tools and sail foams) to power an ice machine……I was watching a documentary on the Amish on youtube.  It was made by a previous Amish person who left the sect.  One of the Amish men they interviewed was wearing jeans and a button down shirt. He had a computer, cell phone, an office and a big old pickup truck.  He was explaining it all away as needing to remain competitive in the construction business.  There was a separate story line on a woman and husband and how God wanted them to drive a minivan and live in a house with electricity. Soon God will want her to divorce him and take his house and minivan and children.There is a big Amish community about 40 miles West of Philly where I live, in Lancaster PA.  Somehow these people manage to commute that 40 miles into Philadelphia to set up stalls in places like Reading terminal Market and other places around Philly.  Who knows, could be just regular people playing dress up to raise the prices they can get on their perfectly ordinary food.  If they are really Amish, they ain’t there by horse and buggy.

        Speaking to the final segment reminds me that Infant Phenom had brought up a term largely discarded by our side, “socialism”.
I realized why I find such Cold War terms unsatisfying and obtuse.Socialism, communism, capitalism…they are all predicated on Marxist economic materialism.
That is, the blank slate of Man as a consoomer, and the Enlightenment assumption that a proper political balance can be found while disregarding biology, culture, and spirit.

        I’m not just being a sperg pointing out nobody gets together and picks up trash in the park anymore.  This is exactly what you are talking about when discussing the lack of community that now permeates most places.  Everyone just assumes the municipal authorities should be doing it.Doing this would require a civic mindedness which no longer exists.  People now live in zip codes and not communities.   There are not a bunch of old women gossiping about the mess in the park and putting pressure on the younger folks to do their duty and go clean it up.  The people using the park just throw their trash right on the ground. It’s nobody’s park and nobody cares.

            There’s no point in cleaning up the parks until the source of the problem — human refuse — is eliminated from the locality, preferably the entire nation.It just occurred to me: During my several trips to and throughout Mexico, it will come as no shock to readers that yes, many of their public streets are quite littered. But their city parks? Well maintained (by Latin American standards at least), and depending upon time of day, with well-behaved locals, vendors, the occasional policeman and sanitation workers cleaning up the odd piece of litter. Note that I’m talking about normal evenings, not special holidays or events.

                Snowden and Assange should be on Trump’s pardon list.  Ross Ulbricht, who Trump is considering pardoning, at least that is what he told the Libertarians, likely belongs right where he is.  I’m certainly not an expert in the case or Silk Road, but from what I know, he’s a drug dealer masquerading as a freedom fighter.  But if Trump does pardon him, at least he’s a White drug dealer being pardoned by Trump and not a bunch of blacks from the fed pen like last time.

That’s more what They want you to think. It’s the same as crypto — if They can convince people that’s all about drugs and kiddie porn They can shut it down to thunderous applause. Was Silk Road used to sell drugs? Absolutely. Probably also kiddie porn, weapons, maybe even humans. But they sure don’t seem to be too excited about the same thing happening due to Mayorkas and Biden.

        Fertility and morale go hand-in-hand. Modern or modernizing societies emphasize personal fulfillment and the materialism that some confuse with fulfillment. That materialism is poison to social morale and the religion that sustains it. Throw in easy means of contraception and, 𝘷𝘰𝘪𝘭à, you have a baby bust. The regime encourages the bust by anti-natal propaganda, which claims that the world is over-procreating when the reverse is the truth (in the First World).

        An important aspect of empirical science is repeatability. Einstein’s Theory of Relativity has been demonstrated repeatedly in many venues by many different scientists. This practice earns credibility and points at a fundamental attribute of reality. The Mouse Utopia experiment has been demonstrated to be repeatable. Reproduction in the absence of fitness culling begets DNA pollution and a steady decline in robustness.

        “One of the many strange things about this age is that the most urgent issue facing the developed world gets the least amount of attention. That urgent thing is the collapse of fertility in every country with indoor toilets.”Crisis? It’sgoodthat population reduction is here, if it actually is. Lower quantity of life means higher quality of life: More room. Fewer traffic jams. Less air and water pollution. Less desperate mining the Earth for resources and urgent infrastructure construction.The only crisis is that Africans and other primitives are breeding like fruit flies. Their cities have higher populations than any in the Western world because privileged whites worship Africans and give them no end of aid so they can avoid the natural consequences of overpopulation.Rather than tackle the problem at its source, too many whites tolerate it and propose engaging in a birthing contest with the black and brown masses. That contest can’t be won by the first world, and even if it could, the result would be degraded quality of life and lower living standards in our own parts of the world.

        Given the irreversible degeneracy of modern culture, and the irredeemable disgustingness of the non-whites, I see a worldwide collapse of birth rates as an absolute good.  Best to start planning how to wind this whole thing down with as little pain as we can manage.I’ve recently passed the half-century mark, and I’ve not seen things get better in any given year in the last half of my life to date.  Every living person, even if “doing well” personally, must see that things are in a state of decay that cannot be arrested, largely because there is no mechanism to change anything for the better.  I have young nieces (because my brother couldn’t keep it zipped to save his life), and when I consider their future prospects I can only feel deep pity for them.  They’ll never have stable marriages with reasonable hope of material security.  If they do marry, they’ll either have to settle for bad, low-class mates or they’ll somehow find good guys and then cause enough drama/trouble to wreck that.  Better they not become mothers.

        Hungary has the right idea, award cash and tax benefits to the heritage citizens aka white MARRIED women who stay home and have babies…I believe some women who might otherwise be good mothers currently don’t have babies because they fear their male partner will leave them destitute at some point, but if an income could be assured them, no matter what, maybe the birth levels could be changed.
