        Another great game is being played by O and the EU: end of the nation state global political division in favor of world feudalism.  At the top of the heap are politicians, bureaucrats and billionaires delivering their edicts to the enthralled masses.  Two main weapons are being employed, islamic and other peasant migrants and energy rationing.  The Plan is progressing well. Can it be stopped?

        That fits with Putin’s pattern of casting himself as the protector of the Slavs
Funny, Tsar Nicholas II cast himself in the same role.  I forget how that one turned out, but it does seem to be a pattern with Russian autocrats…..
…which is why I love being an American.  We have the attention span of goldfish.  Every day is a new adventure, completely unconnected to what came before!  And our “leaders” are even better — they have the attention spans ofconcussedgoldfish.  Good times.

        “Europe today is a powder keg and the leaders are like men smoking in an arsenal … A single spark will set off an explosion that will consume us all … I cannot tell you when that explosion will occur, but I can tell you where … Some damned foolish thing in the Balkans will set it off.”
Otto von Bismark (Comment during the Congress of Berlin in 1878, as quoted in “European Diary” by Andrei Navrozov, in Chronicles Vol. 32 (2008)).

            The Germans supplied the kindling for that one. They were counting on someone to supply the match.Putin does not have the same aims. He means to take advantage, not take over. War is not in his interests, and how could Europeans go to war in any event?Accidents happen, no doubt, but the Lusitania was no accident, nor particularly was Pearl Harbor. The Gulf of Tonkin was an invention, and even the Creator does not know what is in the mind of a Bush. Putin’s ambitions are less dangerous than our present inattentiveness because ambition may at least be rational and insincerity is not.

        When you have someone in the Oval Office who cannot see beyond the image at the end of his selfie stick, it is difficult for him to see The Big Picture.We could use a chess player.  But they would need to remember, as Robert Grudin wrote:“Chess, which exists predominantly in two dimensions, is one of the most difficult games.  Three-dimensional chess is an invitation to insanity.  But human relationships, even of the simplest order, are like a kind of four-dimensional chess, a game whose pieces and positions change subtly and inexorablybetweenmoves, whose players stare dumbly while their powerful positions deteriorate into hopeless predicaments and while improbable combinations suddenly become inevitable.  To make matters worse, some games are open to any number of players, and all sides are expected to win.”(Time &amp; the Art of Living; Harper &amp; Row, 1982)

        I always point at chess. The reason the Russians are so good at the game is that, unlike the west, they are willing to play the long game. They have been brought up to wait and see what develops while never losing sight of the bigger picture and end-goal. Communism may not have worked out but that was an adjunct to, and not the nature, of the Russian people. it must be something to do with enduring long winters. In chess you evaluate and develop, wait and maneuvre. We however treat it all like a game of ‘pin the tail on the donkey’ which involves a lot of blindfolds.In the west we only see the short game because our shallow politicians and vapid leaders act like children. They are attracted to brightly coloured things, hop around in excitement and dribble a lot down their fronts. Basically everyone west of Moscow wants instant gratification these days: someone jumps, so the west twitches.As the Russians have no plan other than winning in the end, they can afford to sit back and calmly watch the west get giddy over transient and transparent issues. In fact, the west is all trans these days, because it is going anywhere other than shuffling round in small circles.
