        Harris is the arrival of what the country will become as the Boomer finally bow out of running the system and, especially, as they go to that great disco in the sky. There’s a reason that the people in charge have been so reluctant to push out the older Dems such as Schumer, Pelosi, Biden, etc.What comes next is incompetence and open tribalism. Harris, AOC, Whitmer, Newsom, etc., are certainly pliable but are incapable of even pretending to be in charge or, worse, sometimes believe that they really are in charge. They also can’t hide their hatred for Badwhites nor will they be asked to. The future is an endless stream of Girl-Boss, DMV lady, wimpy White Dude and spicy Latina fumbling around the halls of power giving speeches about how evil whites are.

            We still have a good 10-20 years of Boomer rule left.  The youngest Boomers are 59.  Many of these people hang on in office well into their 70s.

                I’d guess 2028 is the last election where Boomers matter…Remember, Boomers were avid consumers, and victims, of the deathvax…

                Kamala herself is technically a boomer, though I think the definition extending to those born through 1964 is a bit of a stretch.

                    While it would be silly to argue those born in 45 would have roughly similar upbringing than those born in 64, they are technically Boomers.OTOH, there is a difference between those born in the early 60s and those born in the late 60s.  A young person coming of age in the 70s had a different experience than those coming of age in 80s.  It wasn’t just fashion and hair, it was the whole outlook. They were also likely to have different generation parents (greatest vs silent).Plus, you have to put the line somewhere and 20 years is perfect for that. Not only is it a nice round number, but it also happens to be or close to the average age of first birth (though not any more).

                        Then why doesn’t Gen X get a full 20 years? Nowhere I’ve seen puts the end of Gen X at 1984. The usual cutoff is 1980.

                            A better theory breaks up generations into about decades long cohorts, based on the rapid changes in culture. The last half of the Boomers is the Jones generation. Gen X would get  spilt into X and Y, etc.

                            They only started that nonsense around the turn of the century. Gen-X is 65-84 and nobody will ever convince me otherwise.It’s so dumb. All the other generations are 20 years going back to the 19th century. From what I can tell, this was largely driven by the media who wanted to make a big deal of the turning over of the millennium.Frankly, I never bought into it in any real sense other than numbers. It’s like the horoscope, only more ridiculous and stupid. People around the same age have the same experiences because they were growing up in the same era. I especially thought gen-x was fake and gay.Just in case gen-X wasn’t fake and gay enough, we now have all these retarded young people calling themselves gen-a.  Every single one of them is gen-z.  But it’s just a way of saying “we’re different. We’re special” all in unison.

                    Correct.  Name me one archetypical Boomer experience – from The Brit Invasion to the Summer of Love, to Vietnam and the Draft, to the Assassinations, to the Moon Landing, to the Civil Rights era, to Woodstock, that someone born in 1964 has any personal, post-pubescent experience of, let alone participation in.

                    No, it’s not a white thing. The Chinese have noted generations. I’m sure observant Asian cultures have. Japan complains about it’s own “lotus eater” generation, aka the generation after it’s own Baby Boomer generation.Nations with advanced civilization will notice generations. Africans may not, although the ones living in the US will have been spilt into generations too. Baby boom black Americans will have had a much easier go at getting steady work if they wanted it, etc.Complaining about the existence of generations may however be a white thing. It makes for a messy set observations, because it notes the impact of childhood environment on adult outlooks and behaviors. Never easy on the best of days to think about. Results will always be fuzzy and mostly qualitative, which modern Europeans balk at.

                I used to spend a lot of time in Brazil back in the late 1990s.  I remember being at a trendy bar and thinking, “this could easily be a trendy bar in America”. In fact the demographics were probably whiter than a similar bar in California at the time.  I wonder now if we’re not on our way to “worse than Brazil”.

                    The south of Brazil is a lot whiter, gets blacker as you go north/north-east (Bahia is the “Black Rome”). São Paulo is more brown + Italian &amp; Japanese, Rio is definitely black.

                    Not sure that South Africa is the model, our blex are being pushed out by jumpers of the southern border. Muslims are reproducing fast and have taken over some cities–Dearborn MI and parts of Minnesota, for example. Politicians are sucking up to Muslims as hard as they are to the blex. Note the tolerance of the pro-Palestinian riots. South Asians are becoming politically and economically prominent, Vivek and half of Kamala come to mind.

If whites have to get on the tribalism bus, I’d guess white dude stops being wimpy. Hard to believe, but we wouldn’t have made it this far if we’re naturally self-hating and suicidal.

        I don’t see a way for Harris to not get the nomination. The media full-court press for Kamala-mania has been impressive so far, and it seems the Obamas are the only holdouts right now. I wouldn’t be surprised if Obama thought shilling Biden in 2020 was so humiliating he vowed never to do it again.They’re going for the quirky, fun wine-aunt label and throwing away everything she voted for and supported in the past, hoping to recreate the blank-slate candidate they successfully create with Obama. It’s going to be a hit with single women while men stand in the background and realize, not as just a meme, that the 19th amendment was a mistake.

            I can see it where she can lose the nomination in Chicago. But it would require some old-time “Bossing” in the background (Think smoke filled rooms and Old Time Political Bosses).If prior to the first vote a block of multiple states with enough electors meet and say “You know, we have enough electors that we can control this. We don’t want Harris. On the first ballot, throw the votes to X” (X being Gov. Hairgel, Gov. Fatso, etc.) AND they throw the votes to X, and Kamalalaladingdong doesn’t get a majority, the convention is open/brokered. (Of course, Candidate X could be giving away the store to get their support.)Lots of fun stuff happens at a brokered convention. But sometimes there’s an organic preference cascade besides brokered give and take. If delegations see their pledged candidate is falling in the vote they may chose to shift to the “strong horse”. If after two or three ballots Harris isn’t gaining in votes, I could see a swing away from her.But it’s anIF.

                The virtual nomination the Democrats use is the week of 8/5.  By the time they get to Chicago, the nomination will have been sown up for 2 weeks.  If any of the Dems want to try and push an alternative, they’ve got next week to do it.  Hence the idea of Biden endorsing Harris.  It makes it much more difficult.Democrats are looking at a scenario where they would have no nominee at all going into, or out of, Chicago.  And the entire convention would have been a disaster.  Quite possibly with fights and violence breaking out.So, they went with the weird Biden-withdraw and his later endorsement of Harris (panic move) which ensures that the delegates Biden won “transfer” to Harris along with the campaign war che$t.

            While the Kamala turd-polishing is impressive, it’s all astro-turfed, a field destined to break back down into thorny weeds the instant someone misses putting down a coverage square.
This all gets to something Z pointed out in that (paraphrasing) it’s less a conspiracy than their unshakable belief in themselves that they can take advantage of any situation as it presents itself.  At this point such a belief would require ignoring a lot of recent history, but introspection was never one of their strengths.

            Chet, the same full-court press deployed to make Harris a “star” and the anointed Dem nominee can just as easily be turned around to make an alibi for her withdrawal—and then to glamorize whoever the powers and principalities decide to bankroll instead.Look how in a matter of days they went from “Biden must go!” to “Biden we hardly knew ye!” Seems like half the country is eager to go obediently along, oblivious to the people and positions they were cheering on yesterday.My guess is that Harris’ husband will be discovered to be embroiled in some financial chicanery (of course, he undoubtedly IS so embroiled already; the press will just be permitted to acknowledge it), and Harris will bow out so as “not to be a distraction in this most important election of our… blah, blah, blah.”If they truly wanted her to be president, she would be it already.

            Taking a peek at Memeorandum the last couple of days, and it deffo looks like they are astroturfing for Kamala.Kamala is offensive to our people, but to the other 50% who are left-leaning or don’t care, Kamala is alive and quirky. I think the Dems will rally around their childless harridan and portray Trump as serious and maniacal and Kamala as breezy and “young”.I just hope the e-right doesn’t start banging on about her past. It’s not going to dissuade most white, black, and Hispanic women. Most of them are sex-positive body-flaunters if not degenerate.Please, please don’t point out that Kamala the first prez candidate whose “ass has been tapped”.

            i see the forced harris nomination as a phase of tempering for the american people.  if americans will accept a disconnected president with obvious mental decline, put in place with a compromised election, allowing a state run executive branch for four years.  why not see if americans will accept a propaganda driven cardboard cutout of black woman commander in chief holding a first place trophy wearing a dunce cap.  all to continue the state run executive branch with no accountability.  biden made public he transferred his powers to the state, most accept the statement as normal.  it makes perfect sense to continue the charade if it is acceptable to half the population.  the dissenting other half? …justify the mass incarceration and genocide of dissent to save the earth.the government check and balance system is failed.  innate behavior of self destructive man will flourish if half the population tolerates the demise.  prepare for massive wealth transfer.

            Yes, the single women will be suckered in. The married/conservative not so much, but then they were always just doubling their husband’s vote anyway.
That said, by reports I get, Harris offends and is unpopular with the donor class, too. That matters. They are ones that are in charge the media narrative.
COVID was a 2 yr national crisis, until it mysterious disappeared from the headlines. The donor class is not going to be impressed with the headlines they create. At best, this maybe a trial balloon.

            They’re going to blow their wad trying to help create faux Kamala-mania.  It’s this shock-and-awe media approach that ALWAYS dies once people get a look at what is going on.They did this with Ukraine, really all the wars in the Middle East, and it rarely works.  You get a few weeks these days, and then people catch onto the scam.Once she starts talking and meeting with people – just like Ron DeSantis, btw – all that money they spent on trying to generate enthusiasm is going to implode.I think that’s why Obama is probably hanging back.  He knows who she is and that she’s toxic, stupid, and useless.The big problem with the fake media is they’ve IMMEDIATELY led with racism/sexism.  That’s usually the last step in the process, not the first, and it’s going to really piss people off.  Especially since the over-the-top nature of the propaganda will stick out like a sore thumb.“Laying it on a little thick, aren’t ya?”  People will think it, immediately.

        “The white saviors who create and implement these race programs are not counting heads looking for the correct number of brown people. They are looking for salvation.”No, they’re not looking for salvation. They are using Negroes as pawns against other whites.It is not that they love Negroes, it is that they hate the fat whites with “Thank you. Jesus” signs on their front lawns waddling onto McDonald’s in a pair of crocs with four kids in tow. They hate lowbrow, plebeian working class entertainment, tases and values. That’s why they put a tranny on a Bud Light can. They hate the rules that Christianity imposes on their sexual, financial and social behavior.They cherry-pick DEI Negroes so they can assume the moral high ground against the “racist” white proles, but the fact is that they can insulate themselves from Negroes any time they choose. (Recall that the Hamptons and Marin County and Martha’s Vineyard did not get burned in the George Floyd riots…)They do not fear Negroes or Jews or Muslims running the country, they fear the heterosexual Christian patriarchy. They do not think the Muslims will ever be powerful enough to impose sharia on the U.S., so they make brown Muslim immigrants their DEI allies against their white enemies. They know if they have a colored president he or she will be a pawn of the elite power structure, like Obama. If that DEI president enrages the white proles, so much the better.This dynamic has been going on since the Civil War. The North did not love Negroes. The North wanted a compliant working class for the capitalist oligarchs. Negro slavery was simply a convenient moral pretext for killing other whites.

Actually going on since before the Civil War. The Great Replacement began with the Irish and Germans. It was already in full swing by the time Lincoln came around to butcher 1/5 of America’s sons.

        The other thing that appointing a competent white man does, is it shows to all White men that they are now subordinate. You can get close to the top. The deal is you do the real work, and the non-White gets the glory and the credit. A feature of Occidental man is his sense of duty in harmony with his desire for personal glory. This is a tension that may cause the White man to walk away from this bargain. His face is now rubbed in it. If He has any dignity left, He walks no matter which party he claims loyalty to.To now, whites grumbled and tolerated “Affirmative Action”, which is really anti-White discrimination and dispossession. We were a large majority and the hires were largely in government in mostly black run, though White funded, municipalities.Obama created BLM and took the hand that he saw on the throat of White folk, that is to say America, and decided to squeeze it as hard as he could with his coalition. Now, sensing an adversary near death, blacks sporting African lapel pins, (you though Israeli flag lapels were alarming), are calling for their ascendent power to go for more.This DIE push has now moved into 24/7 humiliation rituals and overt dispossession of White striver class.You are pushing on the real issue at hand. Jewish left radicals and Puritan class warriors instituted their programs that were ethnic rivalry coupled with intra-ethnic class rivalry. The War On Poverty, The War On Drugs, The Great Society, “Affirmative Action” all failed to achieve the stated aims that used moral claims that the progenitors likely new were thin veneers behind naked power aims.We know the intentions were never what were stated because the failure of those programs were evident in the 90s. Instead of admitting failure they retrenched with the support of the bureaucracy they created to wage this war, and began to overtly blame the “failure” on White people. White Supremacists. Nazis. They were the reason their schemes failed.This betrays that they were never sincere in making society better. This was a war against Americans. Now for the Puritan Whites the chickens are coming very close to home.DIE is just making the war overt and is now going after not just firemen and police and local muni jobs and workers. It is going right after White strivers and professionals even as the world is being invited in to compete with him. Not only does he have to compete with East and South Asian elites, he is subordinated to blacks and “Hispanics.”Again, the bargain is now crystal clear. We unite and reject it, not with euphamism and through proxies, but explicitly from our own mouths and with direct and explicit disavowels.

            Very good. Kamala Harris is practically bioengineered as an anti-DJT candidate. This will be the first campaign with anti-whiteness as its main axis of attack, with a VP to rally goodwhites to the cause – a Jew or a good old boy.Poor Donald is probably actually a CivNat, and all his rappers, bald porn stars, and ex-inmates will rally to the “first woman of color” as she shouts the quiet part out loud.JD was a great choice to debate and expose VP candidate Harris. Now, he will have to debate an older white man with executive experience, so the value of his whiteness has been lost.Unless Trump-Vance can pivot to explicit pro-whiteness, this is going to be a bigger challenge than most think.

                Win or lose the election, this is the transition period, because no matter what we continue to lose. In the case of a loss, explicit advocacy has to begin. The Biden-Fronted tempest is going to quadruple in intensity as the Harris-Fronted deluge. In the case of a win, pandering and proxying will continue to be a losing strategy.
Backed into a corner we are on the cusp of proxies and implicit vaguery giving way to direct representation and explicit statements. If not, leaderless, Americans will capitulate and all will be lost.

                If helping our people use the correct language then politely and respectfully help one person at a time to use the proper language.
We must not be powerless and give in to despair. We don’t face the immediate danger the Winged Hussars did. We can do this.
Be creative if I may suggest. Start up a YouTube/Rumble/Odysee channel and/or blog dedicated to pointing out the premise-validating vs. the truth-revealing language.
That will be of tremendous use. God speed brother.

        This craze about DEI is another example of Nero fiddling while Rome burns. Maybe it’s one characteristic of empires on their way down. I see Boeing planes falling out of the sky, I see anti-virus programs that don’t work, and I see people with liberal arts degrees obsessed about DEI. Meanwhile, when I go abroad, I see German, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese goods for sale but nothing American. The USA wasn’t like this a century back.

                Yeah but the GAE is an empire and tells them what to do.
Chalmers Johnson’s Empire of Debt as finale to his great trilogy says it all. He wrote those way back before he died. He was a classic great American. We are going to have to step into the breach. A polite warning was dismissed. Now harder men with harder tasks will be stepping up. White men let’s do the needful.

                    “Do the needful.”That reminds me of another DEI story. Insider at a US corporation (and before you ask, the board are all or almost all White men, good ole boys, not (Fellow Whites)) tells me all about their constant pushing for “more diversity”…what it is really is cover for them to shift jobs to India and avoid criticism about it. The boys at the top aren’t making way. They’re just getting rid of competent (and pricier) White men further down and replacing them with dirt-cheap Indians, of whom there is to all intents and purposes an endless supply. Sure, the company isn’t as competent operationally – but look at that bottom line and those executive bonuses! Thanks to diversity, our numbers have never been better!

        Zman, I have to disagree that blacks resent affirmative action. Sure, there might be a high IQ doctor here or there that resents it, but 99% of blacks think they deserve it because the white man keeps trying to hold them down.

            This is a new thing. Back in the old days, they tended to resent it. Decades of unconditional praise has made them into the entitled ingrates we see today. That said, most blacks back in the day did not think about it that much. It was the competent blacks who resented it.

                There seems to be a high correlation between those who resent AA and those who skew conservative politically.  I know Clarence Thomas has voiced this, and I’ve heard Ben Carson mention it in a graduation speech long before he was involved in politics.

She WILL make your life a living hell. I can recall at least half a dozen ex’s regaling me with stories of just dealing with this type of situation.Women are jealous in a way that men simply cannot fathom and will spend their every waking moment undermining you, especially if you are young &amp; attractive.

        Google’s all-hands war against ad blocking occasionally makes some temporary gains against the tiny percentage of us who resist, so this week a few frames of a few ads have flashed before me. The latest Kamala ad is an explicit solicitation of donations to fund ads.It’s an ad for more ads, paid for with money that could have been spent onthoseads—pure waste, just a skim, and it says so on the box. Who’s the market for that? Democratsdounderstand their voters.I’m in favor of ignoring secondary effects—rhetorically, strategically. “It makes black people feel bad” has in fact been the GOP’s public case against affirmative action (before they switched to “anti-Asian discrimination”). Result? Black people think Republicans are faggots. “The real victims of false sex crime allegations are the victims who’ll be doubted in the future.” Result? The kinds of women who get raped (statistically) think Republicans are unfuckable. Etc.Do not be clever.The wrong of affirmative action is its injury to white men. Say it. The wrong of a bogus rape charge is against the wrongly charged man. Defend him. The wrongs of “welfare” are to the taxpayer—only. The wrongs of immigration are against the citizenry—only. Do not get cute. It repels everyone except nerds (who repel in turn).

        This is why her polling is terrible, worse than Biden’s, and why she may have to be replaced before the convention.The “virtual nomination” prior to the convention is a desperate attempt to lock Kamala Harris into place. There must be a mad scramble below the surface already to replace wannabe President Whore with a more palatable puppet.Reportedly the Obama faction is unhappy with Harris, a member of the Clinton faction, so they are floating the idea of Senator Mark Kelly as her running mate.Reports are Obama wants her outright replaced. This would indicate he has yet to internalize that he is nothing more than the help, a glorified lawn jockey for the Ruling Class. I suspect Obama is more of an ideologue than the typically corrupt apparatchik associated with his wing of the Uniparty, so that indicates an even greater intelligence deficit. Also, as anyone who has been around a DEI hire knows, they are extremely jealous of their privilege.People who believe in accelerationism–which strikes me as nihilistic, even if I get their point–should work tirelessly on behalf of Harris.

            According to the media, she’s beating Trump in the poles.  Suddenly, she has all the support from Pedo-Wood celebrities and the media is fawning over her.  When she’s successfully installed the reason will be that the voter base was excited to elect the first female, black president.  Imagine a country so rayciss that it had not one, but 2 people of colors as president!

                There are huge numbers of people who would not vote for Trump under any circumstances. He has been fortunate in that his opponents have been loathed also. That was not enough for him to win in 2020 and may not be enough in 2024 if the Dems can ditch Harris and come up with a presentable candidate (admittedly, their bench is thin).

                Wish-casting.  I wouldn’t count out their ability to get her to within the margin of fortification, but this is someone who basically came in last in the 2020 primaries given how much money she had going into it.

        “…if the demographic trends continue. The real choice behind these election dramas is between order and diversity. You cannot have both.”One of our remaining institutions, still in good working order, is the US CensusBureau. There really is no discussion to be made wrt to “if” demographic trends continue—they are “baked into the cake” so to speak.  There are now more “diverse” (read non-White) citizens of young age than there are of heritage stock.  And of course, we know that the Boomer generation (overwhelmingly White) are dying off (gone) in the next 20 years.  At *best*, heritage Whites will settle at a 40-45% or so of the new, diverse America of 2050–and it could be worse, much worse, should open borders continue to increase population numbers at 1-1.5% yearly.The only real “hope” for America, and the only struggle that now matters is the destruction of AA/DEI and the hope for a restoration of meritocracy and a shoring up of  the increasingly collapsing “Smart Fraction”.Heretofore attempts to maintain a “White Majority” was really a proxy for such efforts.  That’s gone forever now (barring separatism or partitioning).  There are no multi-ethnic, diverse, 1st world superpowers.  There’s a reason for this…

            Stopped reading after your first sentence regarding the Census Bureau. Apparently, you have been living under a rock for the past 14 years. It has been thoroughly and completely politicized and weaponized since 2010.
You normally post thoughtful, informed remarks. Not sure how you could miss the mark so widely on this one.

        Prior to the 2020 Democrat primary campaign, hopes were high for Kamala, who seemed to check the DEI boxes. Woman and brown, but not too brown. She comes across as kind of vague exactly what ethnicity she is, a model for their Browning of America project.Then came the primaries and Kamala was a disaster among the huge number of candidates, coming across as unlikeable and stupid. Later on, it was shocking that she was picked as VP in light of her poor performance, but then maybe not, because the Dems had to balance their “old White man” president problem with diversity.Now here we are again with high hopes for DEI Kamala, and a potential disaster for the Democrats as soon as she takes the stage and presents her unappealing personality featuring her nervous, cackling laughter along with her “nails on a blackboard” speaking style. Fun times ahead.

        If you read the WSJ, it appears that Harris is on a roll to a 50 state landslide. The battlespace is being prepped for the mother of all steals. Karl Rove has declared her invincible, so has Colman Jenkins.The managerial drones like Christopher Wray (soft, squishy, effeminate) work in a nearly 100% female environment. For them, the media is their oxygen. Women cannot exist without the constant affirmation, direction, and control of the media. Being an icky, feminie/gay space — men of all races have discarded the media.The top managers (Wray, Larry Fink of Blackrock, Gina Haspell of the CIA, Bill Gates etc) are convinced that a media blitz will get the entirety of women in America, ESPECIALLY White women who on their part, hate and loathe everything and anything White and male, on the path for voting for Harris over and over again.Harris is black. She’s female.She’s an ex-ho. What among that is not catnip to particularly White Women, like a Taylor Swift concert mixed with an Oprah appearance? As long as the media pushes her, women particularly White women will love her. And vote for her. Of course, the opposite is true for men.This is the fatal flaw for the Managers. They believe their Media Air Force so mighty it can do anything. It has notably failed in Russia, in China, in most of the Third World. Where women are not a force and the media is not allowed in anyway from the West.Thus article after article showing how Europe is in a massive draft effort, in the hope of reaching 150,000 to 210,000 men in a few months to shove into Ukraine. Once that happens, well Article 5 of NATO requires us to respond, which means a Draft. A draft is coming, its a slam dunk.And in my opinion, the draft not the steal of the election will kick off the next civil war in the US (already started over “migrants” in Ireland).

            It will be difficult for the media to maintain the honeymoon for 3.5 months. It will be impossible for Kamala herself to do so. Which doesn’t mean the steal won’t happen, I’d lay odds that it will. Even in the unlikely events that Trump both lives to November and wins, he has become just another Republican, a mere pause button on the “left’s” advance rather than a rollback of it. If he can even be said to be a pause. Not much of the “left’s” advance was paused in his first term. He doesn’t talk like other Republicans, but where the rubber meets the road he is no more effective than them, if even that.

        “The failure of affirmative action was that it created black resentment, the exact opposite of what the White saviors were expecting.”And this is one of the overarching problems with blacks – you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t.  Most clear thinking Whites understand that the majority of blacks in positions of influence and authority, in particular, are there largely due to AA.  I would also argue most of those blacks don’t realize it – some probably do, but the rest are so full of themselves and lacking in self introspection they’ll refuse to admit it.As for Kammy, I understand she’s not completely talentless, exspecially while on her back or knees…

            We speak of “midwits” a lot in this group—someone of average or slightly above-average intelligence who is perceived to overestimate their intellectual abilities. These folk very often turning up in subpar academic disciplines.I suspect there is room for another classification of people, “dimwits”—someone of *below* average intelligence who overestimates their intellectual or creative abilities.  These folk lack deep and nuanced understanding of any particular position/field they may be in and most cases would not be in such position without AA or DEI.Perhaps a distinction without a difference, but how else do we describe such people?  They surely are not even of average intelligence.

            Yeah the dems are so fond of doubling down (and getting away with it) I wouldn’t be shocked if someone like the stunning and brave Fani Willis is selected as their veep candidate.

        The way the regime and their media toadies have been promoting the idea of Kamala reminds me of a hurry-up, no-huddle spread offense in college football racing to the ball so they can get off a play before the defense gets set.They’re flooding the zone with their mind rot, hoping voters don’t notice that she has a 100 IQ, couldn’t even make it to Iowa before her campaign flamed out and has the charm and instincts of a concrete bollard.I’m glad I pay no attention to mainstream news sources. This constant turmoil would be unsettling in the least. The chaos this year is like nothing I’ve ever seen.

        Harris is really getting strong astroturfed support. They laundered her a lot of money through ActBlue and I think they are out of time to replace her before the convention even if they wanted to.  Her personality is off putting to normal people and she is obviously dumb, but the anti-Trump vote floor was around 45% before fraud.  He still needs to do a lot right to win.

            Ain’t gonna happen. Fix is in and I believe somehow they have access to the machines. No way an incumbent party sitting on as big a turd as the Dems in 2022 (inflation, Afghanistan, Ukraine…) doesn’t get walloped at the urns. But they didn’t. This leads me to believe there’s some kind of back door into the voting machines.

        The lack of even second level thinking:  Girlboss [black, as if], in cost-cutting move, peremptorily orders storetoom to only carry 4.5 gallon buckets instead of the normal 5 gal.  Of course, since many of our tests are based on the 5 gallon volume, we now must use two buckets in place of one.

            Even a white(r) administrator is not immune to idiotic ideas. Those who worked for the Federal government in the early 1970s may recall the head scratching move to economize by converting 8 x1/2 by 11 paper to 8 by 10. Just imagine the adjustments that had to be made in all types of office machinery. Needless to say the idea was quickly abandoned for the mistake that it was. As a result preteens such as myself enjoyed a multi-year supply of scrap paper brought home by Mom.

                    Latter half of the seventies, about fifth grade, when the other kids were getting their TI-n red diode fancy calculators, my dad gave me two slide rules to use instead. Almost nobody under age 40 today has heard the term “slide rule” applied. Although they know there were these genius black ladies who were abused as “calculators” and without their noble sacrifices space travel would be a mere pipe dream. Pretty sure Von Braun could zing a slide rule. Nostalgia.

        I suppose there could be a benefit to having Kamala as the presumed nominee, only to switch at the last minute at the DNC.  By constantly changing the target, Trump’s team keeps having to shift focus, and this might put them off balance. The Dems are the party of chaos, after all.
Although, another more probable explanation is that they are a drowning man thrashing about in the water in panic, unable to think about the next minute much less November.

        Everyone really does believe the DEI stuff, even people in various analytics roles who – one imagines – are paid to notice things.Was talking with one modeler about default risk a year ago. He insisted that data showing blacks default at higher rates, even controlling for everything else modelers can observe, simply show the data are themselves biased in some way that is due to institutional historic prejudice.But that’s the logic: I have a headache, so I take an aspirin. It doesn’t work, so I take more and more, eventually taking a truckload of aspirin. But a brain bleed isn’t fixed by aspirin.But these people will never admit they’ve misdiagnosed the reason for black failure in America. As a result, DEI has locked itself into the logic of genocide very easily: we’ve landed at the place where the real problem is Whiteness, itself, and that is caused by Whites. The solution suggests itself.

        Last I read, the Dems were still planning a virtual nomination the first week of August. Hilariously, when that Biden letter was transmitted by the borg, a bunch of state delegations immediately threw their support to Harris.Nevermind that nobody in their states voted for her to be the nominee. They downloaded their firmware update and announced their support.I had been saying for weeks that Biden only had to get to early August. The bruises on his face in that hostage video he made indicate some sort of fall or blood clot. They were not planning to quit. Their hand got forced because whatever happened, they were worried he would not survive the weekend.Harris is a money issue. It’s easier to move all that money to her without raising suspicion. An open convention seriously damages the money bin. So they hastily issued a second letter (Biden didn’t write that one, either) endorsing Harris.If the virtual nomination happens the week of 8/5, there will be no open convention. It’ll be decided. TPTB have a week to try and keep the D-train from flying off the rails. It appears they are going to fail.DIE has fractured that party beyond repair. That why Biden made that crazy claim last night that he’s the best president ever, and everything is going awesome in America, but he has to quit to “unite the party”. That’s as nuts as it sounds.  Every lie contains a nugget of truth: the Democrat party is fractured badly.If they don’t get rid of Harris by the end of next week, Trump will win 45 states in the biggest landslide since Reagan ‘84. And the Congressional coattails will be similarly massive.Let’s pray they decide to do something meaningful with that power.

        Sorry folks, I have a real hard time believing that Hillary, while she yet lives and breathes, is just going to sit back and let Kamala friggin Harris, of all people, become the first woman president. Does not compute. Not buying it. Reference Apex Predator’s reply to Compsci elswhere in this comment section. H providing one of the very first endorsements for K makes it all the more suspicious.

        Pliability rather than competence can be seen as an asset in today’s politics. Ms. Harris scores highly in this respect. I suspect the benefit of this feature has now dawned on Mr. Obama who can see the possibility him being able run the show behind the scenes for the next eight years while at the same time shutting down the Clinton wing of the party. Meanwhile Mr. Trump will continue preaching to the choir while blithely making blunders like inviting the Israeli leader to his home. Such episodes burnish his standing with the Lindsey Graham coterie (which would support him in any case) while wiping out much needed support in Dearborn Michigan.Meanwhile Ms. Harris, having done nothing of import and said nothing that can be held against her (or even deciphered) can be shaped into a new image by daytime TV.

            Lets get real. Dearborn will never support Trump because he’s White. Simple as that. The Hamas-istan people rioting and burning American flags while cursing America should disabuse you of any utility of appealing to Hamasistan. Yes they hate your enemies. They hate you MORE.The riots, beating of cops, defacing of monuments was a clear signal that the Soros Wing rules all, and that we have a two tier system of justice and law enforcement, with Hamas not only being above the law but being the law.Yes that makes people like Bill Ackman temporary allies as they can see the Oct 7 coming for them. [Big shots like Larry Fink are immune of course]. Paris is worth a mass.After that fiasco Trump’s “Muslim Ban” looks real good, including to important people he did not have the backing of last time. Make of that what you will. My take is that the CIA/Soros feel so powerful that they want/need dominance displays to rub normies nose in it more than anything. They likely feel like Sadistic Gods

                In my quest to get real, I have noticed that there are now a lot of “Islamic Centers” throughout America, many members of which are vote enabled. While the folks in Dearborn probably won’t vote for Mr. Trump, they can certainly influence friends and relatives elsewhere, each of which has as many votes as Mr. Whiskey. Platonic friends are better than bitter enemies.

        In today’s essay Zman twice combines the terms meritocracy and egalitarian as if they were compatible. They are not; those two are completely antithetical. Perhaps I am confused by the distinction between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. Nevertheless it remains a fact that men are not equal nor shall they ever become so.

            Not really. In a society of equals in which merit is the sole criteria, then effort and desire are responsible for 100% of the differences, according to people who subscribe to such things. Now, I would agree that you cannot have equality and merit, but that is what our ruler think, so I used their version for this purpose.

        You cannot have a meritocratic, egalitarian society and at the same time have special rights for certain people based on dubious claims about the suffering of their ancestorshere is a quote from a question in a logic book I’m studying:Racial segregation in schools generates severe feelings of inferiority among black students. Whatever generates such feelings treats students unfairly on the basis of race. Anything that treats students unfairly on the basis of race violates the 14th amendment. Whatever violates the 14the amendment is unconstitutional. This racial segregation in schools is unconstitutional.now right after the question it says this:this was the reasoning behind the 1954 Brown vs Topeka Board Supreme Court decisionI haven’t read the decision myself but if it’s true that “feelings” are enough to destroy a nation, we’re in big trouble…actually this syllogism is valid based on the premises, but the “feelings” premise is doubtfully true.

            The 25th isn’t necessarily a quick or easy process. If the president refuses to go, requires a 2/3 congressional majority, in addition to a majority of the cabinet.
Perhaps the question is why Joe refuses to go? Why is he hanging on? I think that’s one big clue that this present Kamala fest is just a trial run, and if she doesn’t perform/poll well enough in the next 3 weeks then she’ll get the hook.

                Ah, but what equals a “trial run”?  She seems to have taken to the airwaves with her assigned talking points.  She speaks well from the teleprompter.  Do they need more than that?  After all, they’ve handled our present brain dead president for the majority of his term—and he doesn’t know what day it is.

                I think the reason is that going into last weekend he had no intention of dropping out. Look at the bruises on his face in the hostage video last night. He either fell or had some sort of scary health episode. There was worry he would not survive the week(end). So a letter was drafted up and posted on Twitter. They were in such a panic (there’s a lot of campaign money at stake) they forgot to endorse Harris. A second tweet was hurriedly sent.Biden regains consciousness and they decide to try and stick it out as President. Biden absolutely despises Harris for the same reasons all people hate her: she’s stupid, toxic, and useless. Biden’s still POTUS because President Harris risks a major catastrophe befalling us all. And TPTB don’t want to be incinerated, either.I think the donors will be threatened/bribed into compliance, but I’m certain there will be attempts to get her out of there before she sets the Left back 30 years.There are multiple SCOTUS seats up for grabs in the next 4 years. If that court goes 7-2 conservative (or, more charitably, 6-3 because of Roberts), Katie bar the door, because a lot of the Left’s pet projects are gonna die.Democrats are in a huge, huge, mess.

            She has to get a majority of the Cabinet to agree to remove him. Look at the people in the Cabinet, then look at their Early Life sections. Biden is their stooge who does whatever they say. They will not vote to replace him with an unknown, especially with Kamala, who has openly expressed support for the Palestinians.
