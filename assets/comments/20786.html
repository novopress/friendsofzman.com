        GE as a company that makes things is heavily dependent upon the aviation industry. Aviation is in for a rough ride. Demand is way down and is probably going to stay that way. Lots of bankruptcies are probably inevitable.  Ship building and oil refineries are other sectors where they manufacture big ticket items. Neither of those are going to come roaring back either.While small businesses and paycheck Americans will get endless lectures about the integrity of the market and the benefits of playing by the old rules‚Ä¶Gov will pump trillions into GE and other too big to fail entities at your expense. Five years from now after you‚Äôve lost your dry cleaners, hardware store, bookkeeping service and small construction firm‚Ä¶GE and Starbucks will have picked them all up with the help of Gov/Fed moolah. The free market at work.

            I can‚Äôt find the image, but around twenty years ago the government was considering breaking up Microsoft. The cartoon shows two shoppers in a ‚ÄúMicrosoft Mall‚Äù where all the stores are Microsoft-branded (but not software) goods and services. The caption says ‚ÄúI knew they would find a way to wiggle out of it!‚ÄùPerhaps that is a future we shall see, but due to FAANG picking up the pieces, not because the Justice department took anti-Trust actions üôÅ

            Aviation is in for a rough ride.
Not only because of the Virus. As the West, and the world, becomes increasingly 3rd worldized, flying will become less and less safe. The Canadian TSA is entirely non-white, Arabs, Sikhs and other vibrants who look to have a chip on their shoulders.
The airport staff, security, and people who clean out the planes are increasingly taking on a Somali appearance, in Canadian airports.
One day it will go boom, either due to malfeasance or simple incompetence. Air travel will become less and less attractive.

                The Obama administration thought air traffic controllers were too White. They changed the screening criteria to a questionnaire that had, among other questions, ‚ÄúWhat sports do you enjoy?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if that practice is still in effect or what impact it has had. Maybe I DON‚ÄôT want to know.

                Agree. Most major airline ‚Äúhub‚Äù cities are experiencing the full glory of BLM peaceful marching. SEA, MSP, DFW, BWI, ORD etc‚Ä¶airlines are going to have a tough time selling tickets to cities that are not safe and hollowing out.
Big cities are dead.

                    And it‚Äôs a tragedy. Unlike the majority of conservatives, I love the city. I love the energy, bustle, excitement, spontaneity, and career opportunities. I especially love the aesthetic of old cities.Seeing Detroit, NYC, Philly, Baltimore, etc. makes me seethe with anger, both at the blacks and at the whites for giving them up. I guess a new wave of cities are going to be hollowed out.Whites need a reverse white flight back to the cities. Affordable housing for whites, parks, urban planning. We don‚Äôt need more suburbs and rural areas have no power, though I don‚Äôt begrudge anyone who lives there.

                        Zman has waxed on the beauty of BWI before, and I agree. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see it decaying rapidly.Minneapolis is as ‚Äúurban renewal‚Äù as they come, gentrification on steroids (Riverfront/Old Mill District). Baltimore tried this as well with the Inner Harbor.You‚Äôd be insane to walk at night in either of these places, and you‚Äôd best keep your head on a swivel at night‚Ä¶in your large, sober group. For god‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt bring children.Believe me, if you‚Äôd spent $700k+ on a condo in downtown MSP a couple of years ago, you‚Äôd be very, very pissed at the value you‚Äôd just lost, and will never recover. Nobody with any sense will buy in a major urban area that is heavily involuntary immigrant stock until freedom of association comes back.

                        Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), Brown Vs. Board of Education (1954) and the 1964 Civil Rights Act did the most to destroy our big cities. The virus and Antifa‚Äôs antics add the final flourish.

        GE even owns (owned? it‚Äôs hard to tell anymore) its own propaganda division, NBC. It reminds me a lot of IBM, which used to make stuff through the 1990s, then sold all that off to foreign companies and now only offers vague ‚Äúservices.‚ÄùWhat the lolbertarians and other GOP apologists for what passes for ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù these days don‚Äôt realize is that pretty much every American company of a certain size now behaves like Mitt Romney‚Äôs Bain Capital: financializing and selling off assets to foreigners and using foreign scab labor to undercut Americans. Theyallbehave like scrappers at auction and it‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt be voting for the GOP ever again: Republicans have sold their tinny souls to big business for so long they willalwaysdefer to big business‚Äô desire for border jumpers and cheap Indians. And what do those Indians do once they‚Äôre in? Bring in and hire only their extended families, shutting out Americans while actively tweeting for their death. Republicans are race traitors through and through, sacrificing our posterity for a dollar discount on a software package.You could argue that even during the height of the industrial revolution, the big companies and trusts never produced any value; only small companies produce new technologies and are the hungriest for labor, and as soon as the mergers and consolidations start, both product quality and the workers‚Äô quality of life decline. Not by accident was small business destroyed during the virus shutdown, leaving it open to predatory financialization: Mary‚Äôs Garden Center had to close and die; Home Depot and Lowe‚Äôs got all her business while tweeting about/funneling cash to BLM and changing their logos to rainbow flags.The lolbertarians and Conservative Inc types who are (even today!) still arguing against any rules and regulations for reining in tech totalitarianism never foresaw how closely late-stage capitalism would resemble the old state-owned enterprises of Communism.Few of the big companies left in the US today produce anything of value. These monopolies and oligopolies depend on government contracting and subsidies‚Äîthey would never survive in a ‚Äúreal world‚Äù that no longer exists‚Äîand they extort customers to remain locked into their shitty products via fraudulent licensing agreements rather than ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù for customers. They no longer innovate or produce quality products, but use foreign scab labor to barely maintain‚Äîin an ever-declining spiral of quality‚Äîthe legacy products that white people designed and developed in the 80s and 90s.These corporate dinosaurs are even more tyrannical than the old Soviet state enterprises when it comes to social conformity. At least behind the Iron Curtain everyone was guaranteed a job, even the internally-exiled and even if it resulted in ‚Äúinefficient‚Äù overemployment in certain sectors. But that ‚Äúinefficiency‚Äù was because they understood the economy existed to serve the people‚Äîto provide full employment‚Äîrather than vice versa.In the dying US, not only has labor been ‚Äúefficiently‚Äù automated and scabbed away, but the oligopolies maintain a tyrannical affirmative action army where it‚Äôs least needed: there aren‚Äôt enough workers actually doing useful things with their hands, but the army of diverse, female and gay managers and paper-pushers incessantly browbeat the dwindling number of real workers, sending them to diversity seminars and firing them for insufficient enthusiasm in the state Black Lives Matter religion.https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/All this has turned me into far more of a ‚Äúthird positionist‚Äù than I was even a year ago. The economy is so fake and gay that I feel instant revulsion and hatred of any libertarians and Con Incs that still defend it. They don‚Äôt understand that economies exist to serve the national polity, not vice versa, and it‚Äôs unlikely they ever will understand.

            You admit that even a year ago you felt differently about all this, then condemn others to a life of ignorance.  That kind of black pilling is destructive.  If you and I could make it to shore, others can as well.  Let‚Äôs figure out how to help.

        Boeing is a very similar story. As the finance whiz kids moved in, the engineering standards slowly faltered. That‚Äôs how you moved from the B-17 which was famous for staying up after the Luftwaffe blew huge holes in it to the 737 Max, which has a tendency to fall out of the sky on its own.

            That was not a coincidence. James McNerny, CEO from 2005-2015, came from the GE executive ranks and imposed GE-style cost cutting at Boeing. The 737 Max design disaster occurred under his watch, but he retired just in time to shift blame onto the new CEO, Dennis Muilenburg.I did a decent amount of tech consulting work for Boeing during that time. Every corner that could be cut was cut, twice. Complete disaster.

        There isn‚Äôt a way back to an economy of things rather than finance and ‚Äúinformation‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt start from the ground up.Private sector ETF outfits like Blackrock are increasingly replacing the Fed by performing services it is not legally permitted to offer ‚Äì like picking winners &amp; losers in the marketplace. And their scale is beyond imagining ‚Äì tens of trillions of dollars in assets effectively under their control while they Talmudically deny owning the underlying assets.Having an ETF firm as the foundation for the American economy is even worse than the Fed. It makes bailouts mandatory and inevitable.Any run on an ETF immediately creates a liquidity issue because the underlying stocks cannot be liquidated rapidly and cost-effectively enough to meet immediate-demand payout without massive amounts of external cash or other drastic government intervention.GE isn‚Äôt the only megacorp that is resting on this foundation of sand. All of them, along with the entire U.S. economy and with it the world economy and its reserve currency, sink or swim with Blackrock &amp; its money-lending subdivision still misleadingly know as the Federal Reserve banking system.There will be goods, personnel, facilities and some organizational structure that can be salvaged piecemeal from this rotten edifice but in terms of an economy for post-America, the rebuilding starts from the ground up.We‚Äôll be doing the economic equivalent of removing old Roman building stones to build feudal structures in the post-Roman era. And that time is coming very soon.

            GE was the company that popularized the ‚Äúsix-sigma‚Äù management philosophy, which was nothing more than ‚Äúfire everyone at the bottom end of whatever metric you choose to measure‚Äù.  This led to the Romneyesque hollowing out of assets and the offshoring of jobs, all dressed up as a Wharton School style MBA dissertation.

                I disagree. I was a black belt and worked on many quality projects. A lot of it was B-school bullshit, but the systematic analysis of business processes has a long tradition in manufacturing. Applying those techniques to the whole business is not about ‚Äúfiring people at the bottom of the metric.‚Äù That simply did not happen. People got fired. That happens everywhere. It had nothing to do with Six Sigma.The whole Neutron Jack thing was a myth. Like everyone of his generation, Welch was a ‚Äúcore competency‚Äù guy. That meant getting rid of stuff that was better done by vendors or selling off divisions that did not fit the company. Welch was just aggressive with it.

                    ‚ÄúSystemic analysis of business process‚Äù is what a good executive is supposed to do. The problem with things like ‚Äòsix sigma‚Äô and ‚Äòagile‚Äô and all the others is that they started as a good thing for a specific organization, but were cargo-culted by consultants.

            I agree.  Who really knows what‚Äôs real anymore.  How many people even scrutinize the holdings of an ETF?  Why is some bank thrown in there that has no business being in there?  Who was paid off to do that?  And the pension ‚Äúfiduciaries‚Äù are the worst.  Hell, that Chinaman in charge of CalPERS is the biggest walking red flag I‚Äôve ever seen.  All kinds of terrible gambles are being made with pensions these days because they‚Äôre counting on the Fed, which will come through, but at the price of an eventual currency crisis.

        The COO of my old company was a GE alumni.  Like most GE guys, he‚Äôs super smart and detailed when it comes to improving operations.  Like most GE guys, he‚Äôs also blind to strategy and customer satisfaction.  At some point cutting costs, paying people less, and charging customers more stops working.  Looking at how the old place is doing, I‚Äôd say they are way past that point.

                    My first bank account as an adult was in 1988. A savings account paid like 4% interest.  What I don‚Äôt remember at 50 is ever living in a low inflation period.  There are very few people living who can remember a period without inflation.  Anyone under 75 has spent their entire lives in an inflationary environment. Anyone under 50 has lived their entire lives under a fairly high inflationary environment.Even according to inflation . com, there has been 50% inflation between 2000 and 2020. My lifetime has seen 600% inflation.  Inflation.com doesn‚Äôt take productivity increases into consideration. The real inflation rate is probably a lot worse.

                        Depends on commodity you choose. A bad example is Gold üòÄ When it had a monetary link it was valued (approx.) $20/oz (????-1933); $35/oz. (1933-1970), and not linked to dollar afterwards. Since gold is near $2000/oz now, does this mean that prices in general are 10x higher than 20 or 40 years ago (gold hit the $200s then), or for that matter, nearly 100x higher than the early 30s? Of course not. In fact, if you look at historical prices for common items, Gold seems to be grossly overvalued. I did a calculation a few years back using (for example) a gallon of gas. In the depression gas was probably $0.10/gallon. So an ounce of gold would buy 200 gallons. Today, that‚Äôd be worth about $400. Of couse to be more objective you‚Äôd use a basket of several goods and services.None of this is to claim that inflation isn‚Äôt a problem, of course it is. But it is not as easy to measure as it might seem. Also be skeptical of sources.

And as you mentioned, the price of gold, even a moving average just isn‚Äôt useful. Gold is no longer a monetary metal.Nevertheless, we have had steep inflation my entire life. That‚Äôs 50 years of inflation.  There used to be a store at the corner of my childhood street and I can very vaguely remember buying 16oz bottles of soda for like a quarter. Soda in my area is 20oz today, but over $3 a bottle for the 20oz-ers. Granted, that is with a clown tax of .02 oz. There is a name brand bread in my area called Stroehmann. I can remember a time when it was about 29 cents a loaf. It is 4.59 today (the price is pre-printed usually) (though right now Walmart has it for 2.18). When I first started driving back in the late 80s, gas was always under a $1 and stayed that way through most of the 90s and very early oughts. Though it is more expensive, it is not nearly as more expensive as other items. Kerosene used to cost me about .79 and I now pay 3.50. Car insurance was always stupidly high in my area. Highest in the country, I think.  Computers, otoh, are cheaper.All these prices should actually be lower.  All of the cost cutting and productivity increases have been swamped by inflation. Had all this inflation not taken place, but everything else happened just the way it did (I realize this is an impossibility as credit expansion has enabled a lot of it), the price of everything would be minuscule.

                                Yes, well computers and telecommunications are usually not included. I remember the quip in a book about this, saying that for example, theoretically in 1945 you could have made a telephone call from New York to London, but it would have been astronomical in cost.Another reason is that quality is harder to define. E.g. is it fair to compare the average car of today to one fifty years ago?  A century ago?

                                    The quality of cars, I think has gone up.  But the quality of computers, at least build quality has fallen precipitously. The quality of things like clothing, drapery and bed sheets have fallen too.  The build quality of appliances has fallen.In some ways, it is that the lowest of the low has gotten much lower.  Things that were cheap back when were higher quality than low end stuff today.  A lot of the old stuff is gone and so comparisons are not always easy.  But we do have a lot of specimens. There are washing machines, vacuum cleaners and dish washer and air conditioners that are still around. They were made from thicker and higher quality metal, the motors were much beefier, spare parts were usually available for a long time.  If you maintained this stuff, it usually lasted a long time. If they did break, you could fix them. To some extent this is made up for by the low of just replacing the whole thing with a new one.  It‚Äôs a mix of good and bad.I think the claimed increases in efficiency are mostly very overstated. Electronics have gotten a lot more efficient. But this is because they went from vacuum tubes to solid state. Nobody can possibly argue that a modern flat screen is less efficient than a 1960s RCA color TV. But is the air conditioner all that more efficient? Heat pumps (which is what an air conditioner is) have always been efficient. Electric motors, which are what drives the air conditioner, have not gotten a lot more efficient. Maybe they got 5% more efficient? Even that is doubtful. Same with refrigerators. Whatever efficiency gains they have gotten out of refrigerators is  in the form of insulation or more efficient Freon (but I don‚Äôt know).  I had a 70s era air conditioner replaced with a new one. My electric bill didn‚Äôt go down, but the air conditioner broke.

                            Try this one: a model T went for about $300 in 1925.  Thats 15 oz of gold at $20 per oz.  Today, a 2019 Ford Taurus is about $28,000, or about 16 oz of gold at 1750/oz. Inflation was9,333% in 95 years (the Carter years really did us a hard one).You can do the same thing with Corvettes: $10,000 in 1980, $59,000 in 2020 ‚Äì 600% inflation in 40 years.Or chevy Suburbans ‚Äì $27,000 in 2000, $52,000 in 2020 ‚Äì 193% over 20 years (the Great Recession dropped our typical real-world annual inflation from 10% to around 5% for 2 years).Inflation is a lot easier to measure than you are told: its just TPTB spend so much effort concealing it.

                People don‚Äôt understand that cheap credit inflates asset values, and when the credit either gets more expensive or dries up, those asset values shrink dramatically, even as the outstanding debt stays on the books.  That‚Äôs why the Treasury and the Fed are massively money printing and buying up assets, to keep the asset values up.

                        Palace EconomyEven if the fed manages to get out of the corporate bond market, the precedent has been set. Powell/Trump might be Sulla, but I seriously doubt that Pres. Harris and some lackey future chairman will be so timid.The next recession will provide an opportunity for the govt to be king maker for corporations, deciding who gets money and who doesn‚Äôt. The bond markets already assume that the fed will intervene during any crisis, which keeps rates low. Companies will grow (indeed, already have grown) addicted to those low interest rates. Most can‚Äôt survive without those rates.Companies that try to wean themselves off will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage to companies that effectively have free money.So far, Powell has been trying to avoid picking winners and losers, but future administrations will not be so neutral.Whether the fed is at any particular moment buying corporate bonds, it is now the dominant player in those markets and will remain so. Companies will rely on those rates, which means that they are beholden to the fed and, eventually, to the president and Congress.Power is consolidating.

                    The central banks are doing all they can to prevent inflation from going down and avoiding the word ‚Äò deflation ‚Äò. I think part of it is that their revenues are predicated upon inflation and not deflation which would mean a reduction in revenue. We are ground down by the twin millstones of taxation and inflation.I‚Äôve been watching this asset bubble grow, fed by the lowest interest rates in history.The government and the bankers distort the free market and artificially raise the price of housing.Unlimited immigration ‚Äì even if the immigrants aren‚Äôt going to the particular neighbourhood in which a particular house exists, still serves to raise the price because of the phenomenon of White Flight which raises demand. The deductibility of mortgage interest serves to increase the price of homes, as does the existence of mortgages at all.Mortgages raise the price of housing by placing buyers who plan to pay back loans over a period of thirty years in competition with buyers who have saved up their money to buy the house outright. A person can much more easily come up with a large loan than actually save money; and the amount of money accessible by financing far exceeds what the average person is able to save in a reasonable amount of time.Likewise, the availability of financing raises demand, and thus prices. Since not all houses go up for sale simultaneously, just a small proportion of buyers using mortgages can raise the price of houses outside the range of people who are trying to save the money to buy a house without a mortgage.In practice, then, wide availability of mortgages causes prices to rise at a rate faster than the rise in wages, meaning that saving to buy a house outright without a mortgage is impossible for most people. So the mechanism of mortgages in and of itself serves to raise the price of housing high enough that mortgage loans are required in order to purchase a house at all.The actual free market is distorted rather than facilitated by capital, and the distortion is to the detriment of people who wish to own a house, both in terms of absolute price, and in terms of the excessive costs incurred through purchasing via a mortgage.It would seem that such is the case across the board ‚Äì cheap credit on good terms and conditions, incentivizes vulture captialism, with gains privatized and losses socialized for the well connected pets of the government.

                        A debt based monetary system requires inflation because money must be continuously added to the system to pay interest expense. If this process stops, it quickly binds up and then the system enters a deflationary spiral that feeds upon itself and is difficult to stop. The system prefers inflation where the elite are first to receive newly created money before it depreciates.

It may well be that John Law‚Äôs Mississippi scheme and the Banque Royale‚Äôs banknotes presage the Petrodollar‚Äôs future. This is much more complex than my superficial understanding of modern monetary theory.

                                Yes, I don‚Äôt understand the details, but as interest rates come (came) close to zero or lower, many of the money funds were in the difficult position of how to levy even a tiny expense ratio.

                It‚Äôs not so much the rates themselves as the idea of ‚Äúmoney working for you‚Äù in general, particularly where those gains are preferentially taxed compared to income and are coupled with a  bankruptcy system which caters to the worst cheaters without providing real relief to legitimate debtors who‚Äôve fallen into ‚Äúhousehold zombie economy‚Äù status.
Since the libertarians took over economics, the old conservative standard of ‚Äútwo cheers for capitalism‚Äù has become four.
Government has almost entirely abandoned the idea of policing economic excess and instead promotes the worst abuses of unfettered finance capitalism.

                        I haven‚Äôt looked at the opinions yet (read Striker‚Äôs piece) but this is typical of the contemporary approach to pensions we‚Äôve seen since ERISA. They‚Äôve effectively made pension abuse &amp; fraud a toothless offense.I rarely deal with pension fraud cases because ERISA has already effectively rendered them cost-prohibitive for individual plaintiffs who‚Äôve been ripped off and there‚Äôs a corresponding lack of work on the defense side as a result. Maybe a dozen, certainly less than two, in decades of experience.I also heard today that Roberts cited a case in which he previously dissented for the abortion decision.This is how the kosher sausage gets made ‚Äì the overt Leftists disregard precedent entirely and do whatever they like, the Federalist Society-approved ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù respect their unprincipled overreach as precedent.Every decision of the Supreme Court &amp; most all of the appellate court decisions are just a cynical exercises in politics and results-first, cui bono justice.

                That‚Äôs why I like the idea of a jubilee. Say after 10 years your debt is forgiven. It would limit the power of the financial system and keep prices low. Banks wouldn‚Äôt be handing out bad loans like candy, and they couldn‚Äôt package them in other financial products because they‚Äôd lose value.

I guess initially it would allow the rich to buy everything up, but there‚Äôd be massive deflation so maybe they wouldn‚Äôt.  At any rate it would make us a nation of savers again, instead of debtors.  That‚Äôs the important thing.

                            Absolutely true on a personal, level. The best investment in the world at almost any time is paying off debt.On a societal level though , especially for anyone wanting to live on interest , there is such a thing as the paradox of thrift.

                                If money holds its value you don‚Äôt have to make it work for you. What we have now intentionally devalues money so people won‚Äôt save. Seems to me tptb are most concerned with the velocity of money.  If it‚Äôs not constantly changing hands (‚Äòworking‚Äô), the whole thing falls apart. Basically every creditor‚Äôs dream economy. It‚Äôs not a paradox but a byproduct of the system, and the system could obviously be changed. Build a monetary system based on value instead of debt.

                        The Babylonians also has a Jubilee mainly to prevent the destruction of societyThe reason is too many people meant to be armed freemen defending it became debt slaves without arms or desire to  preserve society.Its not that different here and I would bet that if we had a jubilee especially on college debt and stopped all subsidies as well, the current hysteria would start to subside a bit .

                    Wages measured as percentage GDP about 1/3 what they were in the 70‚Äôs. Also the people liable to want fancy sneakers tend to be have lower income.Thus its  the market adapting or trying to. Though as Nike is seeing, as soon as anyone steps of the treadmill as they had to leave it do to the virus, the systems starts to implode. Nike lost like a billion in a quarter and while bailouts can keep the company alive, like everything in the global economy its a zombie.The smart long term thing to do is to allow a buffered collapse, make sure people have the very basics, kind of like what was done during the lock down but without bailouts.Problem with that as policy is that it may have no recovery point  as the US is too factionalized and deindustrialized to fix things.The other option is basically zombies and while its awful I can fully understand why itw as done.

                    I‚Äôm sure very few did. Simplest proof of that is that there would hardly be any wealthy people or corporations that would have survived those years üôÇThere have always been loopholes, exemptions, deferrals etc. In fact these were far worse pre-1982/86 tax reforms. Also in old days, not sure about income tax brackets, but FICA tax was a tiny fraction compared to what it got raised in 1980s fix. In 1990s most workers paid more FICA than in Federal taxes. Probably still true.

                I used to think that State-ran banks that provided interest-free loans would be the way to go.  Loan origination could be modulated via down payment levels, etc.  I realize that this could allow for politicians to debase the currency but since were at $24 trillion fed debt now that argument seems a bit tenuous.

                Lastly, its interesting to note that Aristotle argues against interest on the basis that money is barren.  I believe that the Church held to usury laws until John Calvin‚Äôs time, just after Martin Luther.  Interest was being allowed but not excessively.

                If it wasn‚Äôt obvious, I was making a reference to how I understand the pre-WWII Germany banking system.  After having to relinquish their gold for WWI reparations, Germany was bankrupt and resorted to, what I think they called, ‚ÄúWork Notes‚Äù.  A 100% fiat currency, it was regulated by the German National banks, I think.  The Germans eschewed the International (Jewish) bankers and proceeded create their own national monetary system.

            Define usury in your context.Is it the older (early Christian) and/or Islamic definition of any charge of interest?Or is it excessive/unjust interest (and/or fees)?  If this, how do we calculate what is just?  Is it market related (weighing only general market risks), situation related (weighing in risk of the person)?  How is risk determined.This is a difficult subject.   I‚Äôm in the latter camp and don‚Äôt have good answers.   Time is money for sure and interest should represent the cost of gaining access to money but also needs to add a risk element.

                The tax code was completely re-written in the late 70‚Äôs due to inflation.  The 1950‚Äôs tax code had loopholes you could drive a truck through.  Any cost of doing business was written off.  int he 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs these loopholes were closed off, but they detached the capital gains tax from ordinary income.  All in all, the effective tax rates haven‚Äôt fluctuated that much.

        The US and the West in general is in for a very tough time in the coming months and years. People will find themselves in desperate straights and not know how it came to be. They will blame whomever the demagogues tell them are the evil ones that destroyed their lives.I was married in the inflationary 70s. I knew which evil bastards to blame. But I suppose I might have taken to the streets if I found everyone out of work; myself included.Out of work, hungry people might well be the tender that sets off the fires of violence in the streets.Regardless, we may see violence soon for a host of reasons.

                    Re. the tender v.e. tinder issue.
This brought to mind the Tender which is a coal car, hauled behind a locomotive, carrying the fuel to fire the engine.
So your use of tender does work in an oblique poetic or metaphorical way.

            Back in 2012(?) there was a big storm (Sandy?) that menaced the North East including Sodom on Hudson. Despite it being merely a big storm rather than the devastating Hurricane that the breathless media promised much property damage occurred (New Jersey especially suffered as I fondly remember) utilities were out- subways flooded etc. for a day or so. Within 18 hours there were reports (never from the corporate media) of gangs of Feral Joggers terrorizing whole neighborhoods of NYC.This was brought to mind by this piece from zero hedge of a couple of weeks ago.https://www.zerohedge.com/political/truck-drivers-reject-deliver-cities-defunded-or-disbanded-police-departments.Who needs sportsball as a spectator sport?All we‚Äôve seen so far is the pre-season training.

                Whether or not it was a good place to work really depended on 1) how far up the food chain you were and 2) how good you were at networking.If you were C-Suite or C-Suite adjacent (VP of XX) the rank and yank didn‚Äôt apply to you. If you were a great networker then you could be confident that at minimum you would never be in that bottom 10%, and could likely be in the top group.But if you were a low level grunt in a back office somewhere, or were an introvert with poor networking skills, the environment was a nightmare. Constantly having to look over your shoulder to make sure others didn‚Äôt try to steal your work concepts, never being able to obtain assistance from anyone who would be ranked with you. It really was inhuman, and as such promoted to the high heavens in places like Amazon where a similar system is in place today. But with the added benefit of Indians looking out for their own caste.

                        Yes, that‚Äôs why most organizations have only CEO-&gt;VP-&gt;Supervisor-&gt;Grunt now. Sometimes there‚Äôs not even a supervisor.It sounds great but this is another reason why our world is so hollowed out now. That entire group of middle managers is gone, so instead of having a CEO make 500k and middle management make 10 million we have a CEO making 10 million and middle management is gone.This flat set up works fine for tech companies, but really limits opportunities elsewhere. There‚Äôs never any built up experience, there‚Äôs no room for that guy who‚Äôs great at his niche to stay long term at his level. Instead it‚Äôs just a constant churn of people who like climbing the ladder.

I think he was just there to insulate the US manager from the grunts and free him up for flashier work that made him look better to the executive team.

                                That‚Äôs the GOP market worshiping nonsense creeping out again. The best parts of our lives are inefficient; family, faith, common associations and community groups.
But you and many others have drank deeply from that well of efficiency. Why does it matter if someone‚Äôs job isn‚Äôt always useful? What‚Äôs wrong with careers that allow someone to coast after working hard for 20 years? Maybe your neighbor is less efficient than those Indians they bring in by the truckload; should we kick him out to make way for the more cost effective immigrant?

            The 10% rule, which gave many a sociopathic CEO‚Äôs and McKinsey &amp; Co vampires a hard-on for years, created a level of paranoia and internal politik that was ultimately toxic to the culture. As Z points out the lease-credit-arbitrage model did not spare the people. Why should it. If you aren‚Äôt building anything you don‚Äôt need to build your people either. The dark triad scrum for ‚Äútalent‚Äù was just one more way to moralize and treating people as capital. Meanwhile, all the smartest guys in the room looked to GE for guidance on how to turn their people into savage opportunists too. I‚Äôm no fan of HR for what it has become but at least they pretended to be human about it. That era saw ‚ÄúPersonnel‚Äù changed to ‚ÄúHuman Resources‚Äù into ‚Äúhuman capital‚Äù.

                A lot of this has to do with eliminating ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù trust and replacing it with vertical trust. The idea in economics was that vertical trust enabled coalitions to form that were poorly aligned with the goals of the profit-maximizing corporation. One way to eliminate this horizontal trust was to super-charge the promotions process: each step in the promotion ladder was a large increase in pay, so the competition for that promotion became much more intense.That is also one contributing factor to the dramatic increase in inclusion and stakeholder talk ‚Äì few can live the empty lives that corporations want, so a million little rules that constrain behavior grow up. In a sense, the old ways, where you lived and worked in a community and therefore were constrained by those reinforcing bonds of the community, provided these constraints organically.

        Welch was always highly regarded in business circles for his streamlining GE‚Äôs overall business segments ‚Äì of course at the expense of ten of thousands of employees ‚Äì neutron Jack.  He did begin getting the company into the financial services during his tenure, but I always considered Immelt to be the ceo who drove the firm into the ground.  GE is pretty much the perfect metaphor for the rise and decline of US manufacturing prowess.

            Welch expanded the financial side of GE when there was both the capacity for the company to do so, and a falling interest rate-expanding real economy along with it.  Circumstances on both sides of that equation have changed, and the company has been incapable of responding to them.  There is probably a lesson in it of how maximizing one set of circumstances leaves you vulnerable to the downsides of others.  Cases in point are dependence on China for things and the just-in-time processes.  Optimized while they function, but a nightmare when they don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt.

        OT: I would like to protest the removal of the voting system. Contrary to it being a popularity contest what it does is allow for me (and others) who don‚Äôt have hours to scroll through the sometimes 500+ comments per topic here. It is a quick metric to sort so I can read maybe 1/2 of the stuff that is the ‚Äòbest‚Äô since I‚Äôm sure most of us don‚Äôt have the time to pour over every single comment on each article.

        The post-Depression laws began to change in the 1980s. I remember when it was news that Sears (remember them?) was offering mortgages üòÄ Later came the repeal of laws restricting insurance and banking to mix. As a result, my State Farm agent (I‚Äôve used all my life) now offers banking and credit cards. I‚Äôve not taken advantage of banking with them (or Sears.) Where was I going with this? Oh yeah, the only thing missing is a new Depression üôÇ The Glass Seagull üôÇ and other Depression era laws were of course meant to reign in the abuses that exacerbated the last crash. Of course removing those barriers doesn‚Äôt require a future crash, but it does invite the old abuses that caused grief in the past.On an unrelated note, I see that advertisers boycotting social media is now a ‚Äúthing.‚Äù If only it were because they objected to restraints on freedom of speech. But no, it is due to ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù. What suprised me is that I thought most of the BadThink (like us) had already been banished. I quit FecesBook end of 2018, have tried Twitter a few times (but too much noise) and even gave up on NextDoor recently due to censored discussions, and it was not even me. But now it appears the big advertisers are being pressured by Antifa &amp; Co. to threaten a boycott of social media. I deduce the goal is to squeeze out whatever remaining BadThink exists on these platforms.Am I wrong? As Z or others often note, we are well on the way to a China style ‚Äúsocial credit‚Äù* system, that magically won‚Äôt interfere with anyone‚Äôs civil rights, because all the shunning and de-platforming will be done with private entities. It‚Äôs good to know that Facebook or Youtube can pick and choose whom they‚Äôll let speak, yet if I were to refuse service to a black person in my restaurant or store, you know what would happen to me. If we‚Äôre going to have civil rights, then let‚Äôs apply them to the social media. Nationalize them, declare them common carriers, whatever.Another pessimistic way to put it is: Have you ever heard a large corporation say ‚ÄúNo, we are not going to ban XXX. We support the right to free speech, dissent and the need to discuss difficult issues. We will not bow to tiny minorities who seek to limit the rights of other Americans.‚Äù No? Didn‚Äôt think so!*We‚Äôd probably much better like a Scandinavian version of that word. It would more likely be a food bank or a credit union üòÄ

                Not saying all second hand is bad, but the Goodwill or Habitat for Humanity that we have here in Central FL tend to have only certain items. If you want VCRs from 1980, Waffle Irons, Bread Makers and mouldering Readers Digest Condensed Books, they are your place! Most of the stuff is little better than yard sale grade. Even at the charity stores, a dirty little secret: the best donations are scooped up by the staff. If you‚Äôre shopping a one man show, you may have better odds.

        The trucks are leased, the warehouses are leased, the employees are leased, the inventories are financed, and the customers, all up and down the chain, are financed.  Somebody, somewhere, is holding a lot of unsecured paper on all of this.  A deflationary reckoning will burn through it all like locusts on farm crops.

            One of the things I think is important to remember is that those trucks are still there, the people are still there, the warehouses are there, and (even) some of the factories are still there. Bankrupting the financiers doesn‚Äôt make the capital equipment (especially the people and the land/buildings) disappear. It will take more work to get back up and running, but it could run again.

                Aye.No one really thinks we are crazy though. Prepping which is the training wheels for our society is perfectly mainstream now . Every Costco has food buckets that were hard as hell to get a few decades ago and even YouTube is chock a bloc with prepper videos and ads. Everyone has gunned up too.E tyranny  will also destroy post industrial society over a short period of time.Its already in crisis as no one is reproducing and fewer and fewer people can maintain it.Worse the needs of woke and a society that is broke means more and more stuff is not being done and E tyranny requires a lot of complex inputs.Way I if figure it Antifa and its chums are smart enough to try and seize land after a half ass  fashion and to realize you have to force people either to comply or get out, it will take not too much for our sclerotic bunch to realize they need to do that too.Leviathan is  in full panic mode will try damned near anything to prevent that, no declining empire has dignity but its not fixable.Now to get  the best outcome, what has to happen is a lot more talk of what would we do with power.How would we do better and how do we deal with our differences. This might attract a few Fed Posters but it will also atract a lot of new people too and make our brand palatable.Carping sucks. Ideas sell.

                The interesting point about the move to electronic only currency is that in effect you will be renting money itself as if it was on a  Kindle. Negative interest rates combined with the ability to lock out of any money source will make the new Dollar like songs on ITunes.
You will have them until they are removed or blocked remotely. And if you don‚Äôt spend quickly enough that balance will start reducing, never mind the inflation effect). If you are outside the system a huge swathe of goods will be impossible to purchase.

            The Nazi regime had wage and price controls, spent like crazy, and had consumer goods shortages by 1937.  As a matter of fact everything the Fed is doing today is eerily familiar to what the Reichsbank was doing in the 30s.  The only difference is that the US loves butter more than guns but is financing plenty of both.  I can‚Äôt think of anything more anti labor than wage controls or anti producer than price controls.

        What is amazing to me is how simple a thing greed is, but how deeply and thoroughly it can rot a society out. There is no replacement, no complex system of financialization or incentives, that can replace good character and moral uprightness. I try to think of this when i am tempted to do the wrong thing: did all of this start with small personal compromises that just kept snowballing? I mean i know that a lot of this is just the presence of alien people who dont care about anything but themselves, but at the end of the day these things could have been slowed, stopped, or reversed by moral conviction and that was lost somewhere along the way, if anyone ever had it, probably one compromise at a time.Good article today. Nice change of pace for a bit from the doom and gloom we see everywhere.

            Why would this surprise you?  George Washington was grifter who wanted Indian land as much as freedom fighter.

Its disgustingIf there ever is a new pro American regime, grifting will have to be stopped for good, not easy but mandatory. Anyone who isn‚Äôt down with honest work can leave.

                Little hard on Washington there, of course he was prosperous but ‚Äúgrifter‚Äù is a bit much, not all business is ‚Äúgrift.‚ÄùOf course if you‚Äôre under 50 I guess you would get that impression.  Maybe 40.  Its hard to say exactly when, but nearly all the grifts and bad behavior are no sooner than Bush I on GOP side and 60s on Dem side.BTW in the past the skimmers also Built.  Even govt skimmers limited themselves. The Empire State building and the even more impressive Triboro bridge went up in a year.  The current crop of scum built nothing, they used centuries of work as collateral for their shit loans rentier scam economy.Recently someone at the upper tiers of DC was informed by a braver than most subordinate ‚ÄúIf graduates of Americas most prestigious schools were put in charge of our electric grid the lights would be dark in weeks.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs always one of my DR frustrations.

                    Scheming to overthrow your sovereign in order to get a choice bit of land is low behavior in my option.And note despite what we are taught. many of the troubles the founding fathers faced were self inflicted as they had no lawful right to what they were asking for.I suppose this makes me a Conservative in the oldest European sense but so be it.Now I rather agree with you on mediocrity but they are still more powerful.More importantly, no one on our side wants power or is willing to take it . I‚Äôve thrown shade on the Founding Fathers plenty but at least they knew to take power and use it.We are not nihilistic enough to demolish the cities which is good but our side does not want to actually run the cities, you know the place where nearly everyone lives or to take responsibility for fixing things.On top of that our own cultural divisions and justified lack of trust in each other‚Äôs group‚Äôs motivations means we can‚Äôt share a polity. Our cultural commons is too depletedThe ‚Äútogether‚Äù meme showing a viking and a knight fighting the various tentacles of the deep state and Them is plausible but this doesn‚Äôt lead to a workable state after.In essence its like an abusive marriage we can‚Äôt live with the current State but we can‚Äôt live without it either.We either find some ideology that is manageable , find a way to split the place up and to keep it or we have to live within the current bounds.

        GE leveraged its high credit rating to buy all sorts of assets with borrowed money.

I‚Äôm guessing a little brown man unfortunately. the other day I needed a part from the shop.they sent it in a UBER. No more truck driver.As far as I can tell a lot of what we‚Äôve been seeing goes back to the 1880s when ((lipshitz)) started to open department stores. People loved the convenience. The cobbler, blacksmith, cooper ,glazer all lost control over quality and pricing. That didn‚Äôt sit well with the fellas down at the beer garden and caused mr department store a lot of trouble. I don‚Äôt think people realize that we‚Äôre swiping ourselves into obsolescence‚Ä¶ again

                I bought a GE microwave last year. But I experienced an issue with it within nine months and took it in this afternoon. The local dealer is confident he can fix it within 48 hours. Admittedly a very nice looking design.

        A friend of mine worked for one of the consulting companies, Deloitte or something like that, ten years ago and had one of the GE divisions as his client.  I still remember him telling me about how the execs at that division were clamoring for more credit to do stock buybacks, the only way they were going to be able to retire with their nest egg intact.The PTB will fight tooth and nail against any sort of deflation.  We are on a one way roller coaster ride worldwide with the central banks in charge of the machine.  It can only go one way.

            Andrew Mellon.  And he was right.  High interest rates would accomplish most of this for us.  However it won‚Äôt happen without a currency crisis because the entire economy, including all government entities and businesses large and small are entirely addicted to cheap credit.  The shock wave (which must happen eventually) will obliterate so much of what we think of as rock solid.

            Mellon was right, caveat he didn‚Äôt realize or maybe care  that a lot of people were going hungry and that people cannot and will not wait to feed families.Something like food stamps would  have allowed him to do the liquidation even against the wishes of the elite of the time but well, it didn‚Äôt and you got President for Life Roosevelt.As an aside If I did by research correctly, the US fertility rate hit 1.8 or so during the depression and a good argumen could thus be made that the post war period wasn‚Äôt a recovery but a bubble and the underlying economy has returned to its normal dire condition.

            I could never watch Molyneux because his self-infatuated manner is disturbing.  I‚Äôve always thought he was safe from banning, since he had the philosopher shield.  And it would be pretty blatant to ban a well-spoken philosopher.  Who, as Z said the other day, does plenty of PC signalling to keep himself safe.  Things are moving rather quickly.

                I‚Äôve often wondered about the bans and how they worked.  All the techies now have some sort of official Leftist doctrine in their Terms of Service but it‚Äôs usually quite (deliberately, I‚Äôm sure) vague.  It‚Äôs also usually impossible to get them to tell you exactlywhatyou were banned for.I suspect the censors are just a collection of SJW women with useless college degrees given more or less carte blanche powers to ban anything they want within the vague guidelines of the ToS.  Perhaps the method to this madness is just to instill terror through random purges along the lines of Stalin.  Eventually everyone with a channel is so nervous that they will ask the censors to review all their content before they even put it out.  Everyone is then assigned a ‚Äúminder‚Äù (commissar) who perhaps has specialized knowledge of the field in which they operate.  This might be a good way to get a little Stockholm Syndrome working too. Eventually YouTubers come to love their commissars and feel that they are an essential part of the production team.It‚Äôs very obvious to me that the big tech platforms have entered ‚ÄúWargames‚Äù territory ‚Äì the only way to win is not to play.  Clearly the tech platforms need to be redefined as common carriers and their teams of airhead college girl censors sent back to working the espresso machines and stripper poles.  This is something Trump could still do in his 2nd term to redeem himself as something more than a speedbump on the road to The Great Convergence.

            From The Verge:‚ÄúWe have strict policies prohibiting hate speech on YouTube, and terminate any channel that repeatedly or egregiously violates those policies,‚Äù a YouTube spokesperson toldThe Verge.‚ÄúAfter updating our guidelines to better address supremacist content, we saw a 5x spike in video removals and have terminated over 25,000 channels for violating our hate speech policies.‚Äù
Of course they‚Äôd want to avoid the word ‚Äúbanned‚Äù.  Too transparent.  But it‚Äôs telling that they chose the darkly martial ‚Äúterminate‚Äù.

                We don‚Äôt have to pretend there are any objective, verifiable criteria for termination. The real standard is ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt like you.‚Äù The mass cross-platform bannings today indicate these originated from higher up, not the SJWs in the trenches.

        Three out of four of the leaders of BLM are black trans women. Makes sense; the more oppressed you are, the greater your social capital with the party. They should all just take the plunge and convert to Islam. That way, they could harness their collect vibrancy to terraform MarsThe trans element actually comforts me. It means the power structure is inherently tenuous and underminded, and that it just might implode instead of explode. What matters is not being near the event horizon when this implosion occurs, lest you be food for the vacuum.‚ÄúIf ye have not a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.‚Äù

        Lot of GE‚Äôs troubles come out their various reinsurance businesses.  Got into them under the Buffet model of using the cash to harvest float.  But that only works when you have management top to bottom that clearly understands the risks coming on the books‚Äìparticularly the very long tailed variety.  And GE did not any Ajit Jains (Buffet‚Äôs guy) nor the investment expertise.  Got themselves into some very badly priced long term care and similar products that have become a constant earning drain in an environment where the investment income is nowhere near the projections in the models when the business was transacted.  There are a lot of actuarial games you can play to cover it over in the short term (which I believe they did) but the monster keeps growing.  Which it has.  Employers Re, one of the companies GE bought was always sort of a cesspool, but the financial whizzes thought they had all the answers.  But as is so often the case in that industry, tail risk is the ultimate leveler of hubris.

                Problem is these blocks came on in the 90s, so even if you used the most conservative fixed income assumptions you got crushed.  Add in that many of these policies (one sold in the early days of the product) had inflation guard provisions and medical inflation has run substantially ahead of general CPI.  Normally, if you reserve the liabilities correctly, you then ladder the fixed income durations against the maturation of the liability.  But if you miss the initial reserve amount, use the wrong discount factor and interest rates crash for two decade, you got a problem.

However, your point is not invalid. The fact that you CAN still see his videos on YT will be a short lived phenomenon if he continues sand-blasting his normie viewers with raw unfiltered RealTalk(tm) every single night. When you open the firehose of truth at both Dems and Repubs someone somewhere is going to silence you.

My speculation and that‚Äôs all it is would be they‚Äôd lose more than half theirHuman Data Mining Capitaler excuse me I meant ‚ÄúCustomers.‚Äù
Or maybe the real answer is their business model is optimized for outrage clicks.

        I totally agree with all of this. And of course the ghoul Jack Welch was worshiped like a minor deity.  Welch also had a policy of firing the bottom 10% of performers every year (force ranking) so yes the first couple years he got rid of dead wood, then it became a hyper-competitive, morally devoid (like Welch himself) zero-loyalty, scratching each others eyes out to stay alive kind of place.  The best part of all is that Welch‚Äôs protege Jeff Immelt took over a company that was already exhausted and stretched to the limits, and it started buckling, Welch turned on him like Cujo.  Immelt was implementing Welch‚Äôs exact designs, but Welch‚Äôs ego could never handle the fact that the end result of his leadership was a hollowed out money pit.  That‚Äôs also a lesson for America as it declines.  The people who did this to us do indeed turn on each other like a pit of vipers.

            If you are the CEO of the company that owns the company that owns the company they work for, You expect to be treated well by some pissant ‚Äújournalist‚Äù No?Welch was a bit extreme but still paid attention to the manufacturing core of GE, It was Immelt who completed the judeification of the company
The same thing is happeng at all levels: people are becoming renters, not owners, of all of their life.

        GE‚Äôs aviation division builds fantastic turbofans for both commercial and military aircraft and most of the helo turbines for our military fleet. Ought to be interesting to see what happens with GE since they are one of the two main suppliers (along with Pratt and Whitney) of both the military and airlines.I think the greed of Wall Street has been helped by the fact they ‚Äúhelp‚Äù write the regulations that govern their activities. It‚Äôs also interesting how Wall Street‚Äôs political allegiances have shifted to Democrats, who promise lots of cheap labor and more regulation to kill competitors with mountains of compliance costs.

            What will happen‚Äîas has before with militarily important manufacturers‚Äîis that the Fed‚Äôs will step in to save that aspect  of GE that is essential.  They may require a merger, they may encourage a purchase, they might simply nationalize it.  But it will never stopped manufacturing, or reach a level dysfunction such that it can‚Äôt handle our military needs.

                I‚Äôd like to see the military side of companies like Boeing, GE, Lockheed-Martin etc. nationalized. No need for them to lobby the government, no suits getting huge salaries. Plus, weapons development would slow to a crawl giving the politicians pause when considering war.

                I think we‚Äôll run out of microchips before that.As soon as China things they can get away with it, they‚Äôll take out Taiwan‚Äôs production and starve the globe for them. They may not sell them to the US at all and while we make a few here, we make nowhere near enough.This only requires a a bit more uncertainty to pull off. Its why I hope that President Trump manages a second term and is able to get enough manufacture going to keep a backup plan.

        Clarity matters. GE (like Boeing and other companies) was seduced into a transformation from producer into parasite. And, like a drug dealer that preys on the weak in order to manufacture new addicts, a few nefarious individuals used this corporate seduction in order to enrich themselves on the newly created parasite companies. It only took a few bad actors to accomplish this intentional looting. The good news is that they are few in number and clearly known. It‚Äôs the only way to be sure.

            A deliberate exaggeration on your part. 120,000 plus Americans have died already and the death toll continues to rise. Probably 300k by the end of the year.

                OK say its 7x as deadly as the flu.And?The US could depending on who got culled lose Black Death levels of the population and not even notice after a decade or so.That said a Trump victory is only to buy a bit of time, he Left has already decided that it will be settled with lead and while the Right wants no part of this, its inevitable.This  union/empire is rotten to the core and voting solves nothing.As decent Conservative people we aren‚Äôt going out to do stupid illegal things but the wolf is at our dooor and its going to be fight or reeducation  camp soon enough.Whites will fight, within limits they already are.

                    Then it‚Äôs 7x worse than the flu. Not the Black Death, but not the standard flu either. Just be honest about it. That‚Äôs your best bet: ‚Äúit‚Äôs a moderately lethal disease, mainly to the old and the sick, and highly infectious; though in some rare cases someone young will get sick; and there is basically nothing we can do about it now; wear a mask if you want, or not.‚Äù

                First, look at the CDC‚Äôs total # of deaths vs expected number of deaths. Covid numbers can be manipulated, but total deaths can‚Äôt. What you see is ~50,000 deaths so far this year in excess of what you‚Äôd expect in a normal year. So don‚Äôt give me that 120,000 going to 300k.CDC puts the Covid deaths at 110k, but, again, that number can be fudged. If Covid did kill 110k, then it reduced other types of death so who cares; it‚Äôs still ~50,000 excess deaths so far.The number of Covid deaths is falling just as you‚Äôd expect from a nasty flu that‚Äôs run its course. There is zero chance Covid deaths will hit 300k in this country. It won‚Äôt hit 150k.Covid was an extremely contagious and for people over ~75, fairly dangerous flu. But that‚Äôs all. You don‚Äôt destroy an economy over 50,000 excess deaths, 90%+ of which would have happened within 24 months anyway.Will you shut down the economy during next year‚Äôs flu season? What about dropping the highway speed limit to 35 to dramatically reduce auto accidents?Also, what proof do you have that locking down the economy saved a tremendous number of lives? You don‚Äôt. We could have just told everyone, ‚ÄúHey, if you old or have some condition, stay at home until this virus runs its course. It‚Äôs not dangerous to anyone else so we‚Äôre going keep everything open so they build herd immunity as fast as possible, which will be safer for you.‚Äù

                    I‚Äôm happy to give you that number because it‚Äôs almost certainly true. You provided no link to anything you stated, and I have dozens of links to studies of excess death statistics. You‚Äôre also trying to conflate two different subjects to support your ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù position. That‚Äôs uncalled for because the two subjects are not related to each other.

                    Makes no sense. And that article is from the Daily Caller. Not the best source. I‚Äôve repeatedly debunked their coverage of this elsewhere. The death toll most certainly isn‚Äôt exaggerated, either. We have numbers from many different nations and they all show a large excess death toll in affected areas. For there to be an exaggerated toll, you‚Äôre talking a global conspiracy involving thousands of doctors and scientists. Embracing that nonsense only makes you toxic to normal people. Let your conspiracy theories go.

                    That‚Äôs cool LineIn.  ‚Äô82 was a great year for metal. Didn‚Äôt see my first concert till ‚Äô84.  So you got to be with the original creepy 70‚Äôs Sabbath fans, and the younger fans who turned on to Sabbath through Heaven and Hell in ‚Äô80.  Around mid 80‚Äôs everything got so mainstreamed and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.  I‚Äôm jealous of guys who got to hang with the real fans, burnouts and creeps of say, pre ‚Äô83 metal concerts.

        Having been affiliated in various ways with GE Corporation since before birth ( GE is a multi-generational employer and a family thing, much like the military or government ) I can vouch for Z Man‚Äôs description of what went wrong at the company.  In explaining where the dominance of finance over product came from, he might have added something about the hiring of Ivy-League elites directly into the top ranks instead of promoting from the shop floor which was the practice pre-1990s.  Once upon a time GE was a company run by engineers and not MBAs.  Same goes for much of the business world, in my limited view.One other thought though, Mr. Z:  this article reads like you own the stock and got burned on it.  I hope not for your sake.  It has been a very bad ride.  Curious if my intuition is correct?

        As a former employee of GE I can say that GE changed a lot once Jack Welch took over. Things went down hill from there especially when it came to employee moral. It went from a great place to work to a place that you knew your job was in jeopardyonce you turned 50. At 50 it seemed like the company aid ‚Äúhow can we get rid of this employee.I sued GE when I got laid off. I won $575,000. The judge gave them a new trial, the judge did not let the case go to the jury, he made a summary judgement and I lost. He also told me to pay all of GE attorneys fees. NOt sure how much they were because I told their attorneys to send me the bill and I will pay it but I will then take this case the news media, one I trusted.We must of come to a agreement that day because I never got a bill and I never took it anywhere.I still stay in touch with people that work there and the general opinion I get is they hate the place.Good luck to all the employees still there, hope things work out for you.

        I worked for a small company in LA that GE (after I left) purchased in the late 1990‚Äôs.  They chewed it up and moved it for consolidation with other similar companies which were previously purchased (Allis-Chalmers, and Gemini (Chicago Pneumatic) compressor companies).  All these companies were US founded and HQ‚Äôd.They moved into a new large, wonderful facility in Wisconsin (moving out of older location from A-C heritage nearby).  Then GE purchased Nuovo Pignone (Italy) and eventually moved out of Wisconsin, killing all those American jobs for Italian EU jobs.Rumors I heard of the NP purchase came with Italian government funding/ties ‚Äì I would like to the details.  GE came to the rescue of Italy and American jobs were sacrificed at the alter of profit.I have a hate on for GE and will never buy any of it‚Äôs products.  It‚Äôs a destroyer of worlds and a turncoat of America.

        I just got around to re-listening to Zman‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Five Olds.‚ÄùI noted that with his chief prescriptions, for White people to look out for White interests and to embrace identity politics, nobody fights harder against this than most significant writers and speakers on the Right. Identity politics is still the worst Bad for most of the Right. I see those, ‚Äúthe left‚Äôs embrace of identity politics is bad and divisive articles‚Äù it seems like every few days.

        To add to the present volatility you can add the FED‚Äôs most recent projections about how the economy will perform.An earlier projection(early on during the Covid recession) had the unemployment peaking at around 10% and the GDP dropping 8.5%. This would all occur during the 2nd or 3rd quarter of 2021.A few days ago they released an updated GDPNow estimate. They project a 2nd quarter GDP drop of 39.5 percent. (That .5 percent seems to function as a significant figure in their minds.)That‚Äôs for 2020‚Ä¶not 2021 when they previously thought both GDP and unemployment would bottom out.Is this still called acceleration?https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow

            But now the low interest rates, fees and inflation makes it pointless. Savings accounts earn nothing anymore. Your better off buying collectibles.

            After taxes it didn‚Äôt really keep up with inflation though.Even if the US could be forced to a no inflation economy  via bimetallism, without sgrowth via larger families, there really is little use for all that capital and its value is low. Its downright deflationary.Ultimately  even with a pay increase, for the most part consumer have enough stuff and ignoring for a moment the virus fear, can only use so many services.In essence, we have surplus production, a classic Marxist ‚Äúcrisis of production.‚ÄùI have to idea how to solve it though work sharing, a lower work week  supplemented by government aid might be effective to some degree.

                Re. ‚Äú In essence, we have surplus production, a classic Marxist ‚Äúcrisis of production.‚ÄùThe magnificently unapologetic¬†Oswald Mosley, says the same thing, in an interview with David Frost, in 1967.‚ÄúThe trouble then quite different to the present situation was an overproduction in relation to a given market ‚Äì that is the purchasing power of the western world was not sufficient to absorb the goods which industry were producing.‚Äù‚Äú‚Ä¶ In America the technocrats as they were called , who were highly paid engineers in American Industry were showing that the productive potential of America was so enormous that existing measures could not possibly absorb it and as as a result was there was unemployment , enormous unemployment over there and over here.‚Äù‚ÄúThe particular problem was the inability of Britain, this top heavy island , to sell nearly a third of it‚Äôs total production on the markets of the world in open competition. Originally we had a monopoly position in the markets of the World. That was passing away and we were subject to intensive competition and failing to do it.‚Äúhttps://youtu.be/7j5jJ-VYSps?t=170He circles back to the very same issue in an interview on Thames Television in 1975.‚ÄúThe main problem is to adjust production to consumption. That is in plain language to give the mass of the people the power to consume the goods the mass of the people use.‚ÄùHe says ‚Äúyou need production matched to consumption and that you need two things : a viable area and within that area the government given the power to act‚Äù.Then he talks about the former British Commonwealth and Europe and viable areas. His solution is the will to power.He says, ‚Äú you can solve the problem if you are insulated from world markets and world finance. A viable area and the power to act.‚Äùhttps://youtu.be/HNhF28fzN9I?t=1177I time stamped the links if you are interested. In both programs the interviewers are hostile and the studio audience is filled with bagel goblin‚Äôs heckling him.It‚Äôs not an area that I‚Äôm up on. However, this is very interesting to me, and it may be to you.

        Bravo Z: This sentence is key: ‚ÄúSince the profit in this system is entirely through the skim, the slowing of credit means a collapse in profits.¬†‚Äù  That‚Äôs basically the entire woke economy aka globalist system.  That entire paragraph is key. That‚Äôs also why they‚Äôre all so woke, because without woke they get no credit and go broke.Now the economy could unwind ‚Äì or it could become Feudalized through the Federal Reserve et al ‚Äì downstream bankers being et al.  Which one do we see happening? I see the Fed feudalizing us through not just Woke Capital kneeling but so many of the rest having to beg for permission to exist, PPP and the like.
