        I don’t vote with the expectation of any positive results. I’ve been voting against incumbents since 1970, and never got any. I vote because I see it as my duty to do so. And, no, I do not shirk jury duty, and yes, I enlisted in the Corps for Vietnam. (I admit the enlistment was not entirely motivated by my sense of duty, but it was in there, along with curiosity, and the conviction that I did not want to miss what I thought of as the pivotal event of my generation.)

        Repair_Man_Jack: Really?  Sovereignman?  I’ve been to that site and I feel like gobsmacker … you really think there are places in the world better, free’r than America where you can have personal freedom, safety, and your wealth is not in jeopardy all the same?I doubt it.  Human nature is human nature. All Sovereignman is is a huckster, selling advice like any other financial consultant.  They say all the right things and push all the right buttons but if you analyze what they say and why they would say it, still doesn’t make sense in a practical sense.  Better off just finding your own little oasis and enjoying yourself while getting ready for when the SHTF.

Make yourself more international, if you feel your country has abandoned you.

        It would seem Britain has many faults, as agreed by the rest of the world, so I won’t go into them here. Suffice to say that one thing Britain insists on doing is to give money to countries with their own wealth. For example, the UK with no space program gives money to India with, er, a space program.As belts are tightened by the consistent failure of our governments to reign in free-spending and address the massive debt in which the unpaid interest alone will eventually crush the country, more money is handed over to others. But of course there is a purpose.Britain cares not a fig whether a Hindu is put into space one day, but it does care that India employs people to help check that the Sikhs and the rest have a chance to be an astronaut. in other words, we give other nations cash so they can pay our people to go there and care on a local level.Those happy people who are then indirectly funded by the UK in this fashion can enjoy this glorious life of travel and comfort — they do not live in shanty towns, you can be sure — are separate from the rest of us who have to stay and pay for them to go.It is cosy sinecure that many hope to discover, but the relative few  who have discovered it will keep it all to themselves with new contacts, better contracts and new government-approved  ‘challenges’ popping up when needed.

        I am staring into the abyss of retirement and I have no warm fuzzy feeling that it will be comfortable.  I do not fault our leaders but our electorate.  How this no-ability interloper kardashian type could be elected twice is beyond me.  If this is what America consists of we are truly lost.  Sad face.

        I’ve visited a number of places around the globe, outside the US, where I’ve thought I might want to return for a much longer period of time, but there isn’t even one of those places where I think I’d want to live for the rest of my life.  Noumea, the capital city of New Caledonia, for example, looks like a very pleasant town, but I’m sure it has its problems too.  If the ideal place for me did exist, and I needed to surrender my American citizenship, I wouldn’t find it emotionally difficult to do.  Obama and his radical Democrat friends have made it increasingly difficult for me to love their vision of America.

        I have a sister like this.  She swoops in, races around with no time to spare, then leaves back to her city for another 6-9 months.  I would call them selfish.  They depend on other people with their “roots” to maintain the status quo so they can gallivant to their own desires.  This works while society is stable but leaves them without a chair when the music stops.  Then they will be left looking in like an outsider, even though they are outsiders now.Money buys freedom: allegiance, location, vocation, bargaining power, financial worry, etc.  Most people just don’t have those resources to be able to afford those freedoms (and responsibilities).When citizenship no longer holds it’s intended meaning, does that mean the societal benefits (SS, Medicare/Medicaid, K-12 schools, etc.) will also go away as well?  I can only hope for such a situation where the great social experiments can be freely opted out of instead of giving them away for free.

        The sovereign individual is a very lofty idea. On paper, it sounds fantastic. We should all be able, in theory, to move as we like throughout the world, at will, going wherever we want, setting up temporary shop when the tax rates and business or other environmental and/or cultural atmospheres are suitable, owing no allegiance to any flag or nation.  In reality, few people are able to do this. Your average person has ties to heritage, family, friends, community, and sometimes to the land itself. Maybe the Next Great Leap in human organization will be the ability to forgo the idea of government altogether, or relegate government to a very narrow array of authorities/responsibilities. But for this to work requires many things to fall into place, one of which is near-global agreement on these concepts. I don’t see that happening any time soon.
