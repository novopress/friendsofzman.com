        First of all, if Trump wins, he won’t do any deportations, just like he didn’t “lock her up.” Deep down, you all know that this is true. He needs traditional white men to win, but after exploiting our endless gullibility, he mostly just wants to get Ivanka’s friends to like him.
However, if he did attempt deportations, I believe Derb is more correct than Peter about the likely results. Our enemies have command of almost all our government and media and their highest goal is to disposses us.
Thoughts like these are why I am a revolutionary. Burn. It. Down.

Oh, that’s right up there on the surface, for me.

        Derb is every inch a race realist—except when it comes to Jews.His description of Israel’s latest contribution to Middle East tensions, which heoxymoronicallycharacterizes as a “targeted mass killing,” gives ample reason to listeners more racially aware than himself why they should not rely on this Semitic tribe to decide their future.

        Derb’s complete inability to see the chosen for what they are is astounding to me. People his age just have these ideological blinders on about the topic that seemingly nothing penetrates. Chaim can have a gun to his head and he’d say it’s probably for a good reason to fight those dastardly muslims. Many such cases.

            Derb is hardly perfect, nor am I, or you.In fact he is a stated believer in the lone gunman Oswald govermemt baloney.But would you refuse to hire the best plumber or carpenter for such a stated belief.   There are lots of other things he gets right.DeSantis..  i voted for him in the 2024 primary. But I think his non-handling of the Florida homeowners insurance disaster for old low income Florida’s, who have been there for many years.. is a clear disappointment.And his stance on Abortion.  He could have lost the presidential.election based on that position of absoluteness .There is no perfect Podcaster but me.. (ohh wait.. I have done one yet..)

        Throwing out all those illegals would take a prez with balls of iron. He would need to fire people who won’t do his bidding, arrest people who interfere with deportations (including Republicans), and ignore court orders. Trump couldn’t even manage to deport the “Dreamers” during his four year term.

            A genuine effort at mass deportations would require a declaration of national martial law, suspension of the writ of habeus corpus, and a declaration that any state declaring itself to be a “sanctuary state,” was in a state of rebellion and would be occupied by federal troops.  These moves would probably provoke civil war.

                At least it would be a war worth fighting. I suspect that the sort of people who populate the left don’t have much stomach for combat.The present political order is a recipe for national suicide and the sooner it is overthrown the better.

            Old French sometimes has “leuf’ instead of “lieu.” Also, in Latin “u” and “v” are the same letter. It probably comes from that.

        Derb was one of first podcasters I listened to as I made my way towards and across the great divide.  He’s obviously a big Israel supporter and he’s a bit too tame these days for my tastes – he’s old but I’ll listen to his takes anyway.  Something to do on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon…

            John is wrong, of course. Asylum courts are not regular Article III courts. They have their own set of rules, set by DOJ.
One rule that might work well is Three Strikes. Not for the person seeking asylum, but for the attorney representing him. Three failed cases, your license is revoked to represent anyone in Immigration Court, and cannot be relicensed before at the very least completing a Remedial Studies in Asylum Law. I’d prefer to add a large fine and a flogging, but…

            While I always say getting rid of these aliens would not be difficult, I always mention the hard part, the political will to do so.  In that, Mr Derbyshire is right. They have 10k tricks to stop the deportations.Of course, the executive branch is the branch with the guns.  “You got your stupid ruling, now let’s see you enforce it!”I was just speaking with my wife about Wallace and his cucking.  He enjoyed VAST support within his state.  When the feds sent the guard down there, he had THOUSANDS of state trooper and sheriffs and other armed personnel he could have ordered to disarm the troops.  I don’t think the feds would have called the bluff. Desegregation was not popular among the public and especially not down South.  Congress would have had their phone and mail systems shut down by the complaints across the US.  But we will never know because he cucked. It’s been one cuck after another ever since.

                That’s the beauty of not being Article III courts. The normal rules for judges don’t apply, any more than they do in any other administrative law court. The AG can just lay down new rules and fire any judge who refuses to abide by them. He could also create a panel to review decisions (probably randomly) and make suggestions about who are skirting the rules by just rubber-stamping asylum.
It would be up to Congress to move asylum courts under the umbrella of Article III courts, which is currently very unpopular and probably Unconstitutional.

        “Reddit-ass post,” as the boys say.Morning is the first half of the day, or of the schedule, or anything before lunch, or the time before the sun and air attain their full weight, or…When Trump said that the SS recognized gunfire, he was referring to the agents accompanying him reacting to sounds from the hole ahead. Those sounds were made by other SS agents’ guns, but the agents “bodying” Trump wouldn’t instantly know that. Trump experienced the event from his own point of view. What a dipshit!Why be smug about not being able to understand a normal person speaking normally?Bullies are right about nerds. And they never grow up.

            Whenever you take a bullet to the ear, I’ll remember to grant you the same latitude in your mindset.
It is patently obvious that Trump heard the SS gunshots. The smart take, knowing it was impossible to put Trump in the cross hairs, would have been to tell the cover detail to get Trump out of there. Don’t risk killing the guy in the hide. He has much less to tell that way. If the gunman runs, you know you have been compromised. So why did the SS do the worst possible thing?
