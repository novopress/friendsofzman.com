        Chemical plant safety is also an example of corporate culture. Either your company is safety minded or it ain’t. It takes years and years to evolve into a safe working culture. Unless your company has the balls to ruthlessly weed out careless, ignorant, employees. Unions and effeminate managers of the recent past have mostly eliminated that remedy.

        The managerial class’ seeming inability to deal with a minor public health issue and urban violence is a feature not a bug. They got the results the elite wanted.
Whether the elite can deal with a real crisis will depend on whether they want to solve it or use it for their goals. The elite is far more astute than our side gives them credit for being. Both the Covid hysteria and the Jogger rebellion have worked out extremely well for the ruling class

            In the short term. If things really fall apart, those elite are going to go the way of the Romanovs, the Bourbons, and the Caucescus.

        The Janteloven doesn’t select for humbleness, just for the human wilderness skill of mimicry, so as not to be a target of human envy.That the envy-driven would call fearing their envy “humbleness” is very reasonable.
It selects for the kind of person opposite to your kind, Z Man, as well as the reader of this blog or Taki. Funny, seeing how well you write of it.

            Did anyone else feel like the Tater Joe image [in front of Kamala-Toe &amp; Nantzy Eggplant] was actually a blue screen overlay?On the feed I was watching, there was a strong sense of software clipping at the boundaries of Tater Joe’s jacket sleeves.Here’s a snapshot of Tater &amp; Toe &amp; Eggplant:And here’s a bilateral close-up of the software clipping on the sleeves of his jacket:Having studied the blue screen of the mysterious magical disappearing microphone cover a few weeks ago, it was rather jarring to watch the software clipping this evening.Apparently Medal of Honor winner Tater Joe bravely ventured out into the crowd afterwards and fist-bumped with the wh0re from the Cheney family crime syndicate, which I guess is supposed to prove that the speech was in fact real.But do you suppose the Cheney family wh0res are so utterly corrupt that they’d volunteer as actresses in a blue screen fake?Because that’s pretty much where I’m at now in muh estimation of Carny-Klown-World: Crime family syndicate wh0res volunteering as actresses in blue screen fakes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cAWT3CsATc&amp;t=101s

                Curious why the JIDF would down-voat that kkk0mment, other than maybe just simple malice.
I don’t think I named any j00z whatsoever, although Kamala-Toe is married to one.
Maybe the JIDF is worried about people simply noticing the blue screen effects.

                Can you imagine the kinds of neuropsychiatric structures which would be moved to make a consumer purchase simply because of having seen an advertisement on F@ceC0ck?
On a related note, muh back of the envelope calculation is that about 90% of the so-called “For Sale” ads on F@ceC0ck Marketplace are completely fake, whereas, by contrast, about 90% of the “For Sale” ads on Craigslist tend to be real people selling real items.
Which, in turn, leads me to believe that about 90% of the viewership which Phuckerberg claims to be offering his advertisers is in fact purely a software fiction.

                    Well now I understand why the JIDF downvoated that one – Phuckerberg is a legit Top 5 Uber-Sanhedrin in the entire world of Mammon – so the downvoat makes sense there.

        “Male video game culture seems to be a similar phenomenon. It is a way to be special without having to do anything that is difficult or demanding. You get to be a hero from the couch.”
It’s simply the last place where men can act like men. All those predominately-female drama queens, they need an audience, and men sneaking off to game like men in the man-cave has thus become an entire category of Narrative Violations.

            Gunner Q – Disagree.  I in no way consider hard-core gamers to be ‘manly’ men.  A woodsman, a hunter, a warrior, an outdoor lineman – many working-class Whites.  But gaming as a bastion of masculinity – particularly when I’ve read of numerous games being updated and filled to the brim with ‘wokeness’?  I don’t think so.

                    Was that a downvoat by a JIDF employee, or by a Boomer, or by a JIDF employee who is also a Boomer*?

        Every now and then I imagine what would have happened on Jan. 6 if there were really men holding office in Congress.Can you imagine an Andrew Jackson or a George Washington, even a Teddy Roosevelt ducking into a tunnel and fleeing before the protestors?I have this fantasy vision of an actual great man, standing there at the speaker’s lectern, waiting calmly as the protestors arrived. And he welcomes them, and their right to be in their Capitol. He invites them to stay and sit. He waits for the room to fill. And he speaks to them.Of course, if there were real men in Congress, Jan. 6 wouldn’t have needed to happen.

Found guilty, he is sentenced via contrapasso to a life of white slavery in China. His children, which he purchased from an Ecuadorian woman are joyfully reunited with their birth mother. And everyone was happy ever after.

            May be some interesting dirt there. I don’t usually follow these conspiriracies, alleged, probable or confirmed, but the traditional rule is where there’s smoke, there’s fire.His Facebook/Twitter quote is curious, if authentic. Late in 2020 when the Hunter Biden Laptop was hot in the news, it was reported that Giuliani had one copy of the disk. Giuliani, I hope, is no fool. If you have incriminating evidence, you certainly don’t just keep one copy of it. So I hope that any smoking guns will be released. Do us a public service, sir!

            On April 15, Biden signed an executive order assuming emergency powers of civil asset forfeiture against everybody that D.C. accuses of being a Russian agent. Looks like Giuliani is the first head to roll.
Although I notice they bothered to get a search warrant this time.

            It’s been posited that both Bruce Jenner &amp; Arnold Schwartzenegger were doing so damned many steroids in the 1970s that their ‘nads shrivelled up and stopped making testosterone and that’s why they both aged into septuagenarian girly men.
Plus I’m sure (((The Tribe))) which runs j00llywood had beaucoups blackmail material on both of them.

        Looks like the carnies put Nick Fuentes on the No Fly ListBut not to worry, I’m sure Trump will be right there to speak up and fight for him / sMore and more, turns out Ron Paul was always right.  These no fly lists and wars and so forth were ultimately to be turned against us.  I doubt normie con ever imagined the military would use its training and practice in urban warfare in the Muslim world against him, or that the No Fly List would ever be used against him.  No, that would always be libtards on those lists.  Or that the border wall might be used to lock him in instead locking others out. Preposterous !!  We are a nation of free men and the world is all dying to come here…Blah blah blahMethinks it’s getting close to that time to start considering Mr. Normie Con as an enemy rather than a potential ally

            I hadn’t checked in with Vox for a while.  He quotes this article written by a black conservative:
“The truth is that victimhood is intertwined with the politics of black solidarity. Unless Republicans abandon the message of self-help, blacks will never perceive them as an attractive option to Democrats, and it is a waste of time for Republicans to specifically target black voters.”
Let that message sink in, normie conservatives.  To win the black vote, you must pander harder to blacks than Democrats.  (Trump’s multi-billion dollar Platinum Plan was insufficient.)

                Line – This article was already featured and discussed at Counter Currents, and was first posted at Amren (part of Jared Taylor’s outreach to non-White ‘race realists’).  What Vox Day does not address in his post today as that Matthews characterizes blacks (and others’) ‘tribal’ politics as ‘childish.’  He posts that more mature individuals, like Whites, ought to shun such limited thinking.Lipton Matthews, as a black of whatever political persuasion, does not have White interests at heart.  He doesn’t want Whites to become more tribal and cohesive because then he, as a black outlier, would not be welcome.  Like everyone else, he is concerned about himself first.  I’m really sick and tired of being presented with various numinous Negroes and magic mulattoes and happy hapas and being told I need to listen to them because they’re part of ‘my’ people.

        One of the problems with this situation is that carnies project their own values on others.  They look at social interaction as nothing more than marketing, public relations.  They think that everything stated publicly is part of some manipulation, some scam.  So when real Americans say, “here is a red line.  You cross it, we start shooting,”  they think it’s a performance.  They think it’s part of a negotiating strategy.

                Get ready. They are setting up to use “vax refusal” as a pretext for taking the children, the guns, the jobs, etc.  Anti-vaxxers are the new terrorists. Your neighbors will receive bonus credits for reporting you in the name of “public safety”.

        The people running the show, while being circus people, are also venal cowards.  Given their total lack of any higher morality that makes civilization possible, and their constant ax grinding, I foresee a situation in which they attempt to turn the guns on future “insurrectionists” like the ones in January.

            FWIW, I was dumbfounded when Trump invited his base to DC for j6.  I still have not reconciled why Trump exposed his base to the risk that was actualized.  There is zero chance Trump and his admin were unaware of the risk presented to his base by holding a rally in the mall on that day.Setting aside everything else that had gone on before that day, this was either an egregious misjudgment or a massive scapegoat that didn’t go as planned.  Either way, he’s out of trust because he didn’t just put the people in DC on j6 in harm’s way, he exposed everyone who supported him in any way.  As if Pence was going to be moved one way or another because of a bunch of peaceful people outside of the Capitol.Ha!

            AOC has several useful skills: she looks good on TV, she can spout lefty bullsh*t like a pro, and she can mix her own drinks. Why would  she be any worse than the addled zombie there now? The CFR billionaires and their frontmen would still be running the show anyway.

        Pathologizing normalcy and empowering deviance is the postmodern way.
Alteration through alterity, malfunction through dysfunction, subversion through perversion and destruction through diversity.
These people hate order, beauty, stability and utility. In short, they hate civilization and, for the past 55 years or so, have been working by every waking moment to annihilate it.

                    Sigh. Agreed. His Reign began in earnest a century ago.  Thus the celebration of the Holy Roast that fed His dark power.His people sold you on the kiddie version so you’d sit on your hands and wait on an entity, a personage, on concrete individuals.Not asking you to discard it, but to read it in the manner in which it was written.I find it inspiring that Christians’ spiritual beliefs are utterly separate from the Book- that it was a tool against their kind, that they yet turned to the highest good.I trust the common wisdom of ‘superstitions’, and the Spirit that informs them.

                Brilliant, and Bio Leninism describes the politics of the West. Once Stalin and Mao (really Deng Xiau Peng) won, they needed men of ability as well as loyalty to run things.We live in Carny World because only the dregs have loyalty. Its why Anti Fa are dregs. The footsoldiers are all child molesters, domestic abusers, the like. The organizers and high ups are all the kids of wealthy college professors. Who will inherit nothing — no title, no lands, no peasants, no money, NO STATUS. They are fearful and desperate.BUT, I would take issue with the post that only hope/greed for higher status works, not fear of losing it. Oh that worked to elect Trump. Indeed Trump won the last election and only massive cheating was able to overcome his lead.Now a Smith College prof, black (and ugly naturally) has called for killing all White people. To take their stuff and get racial revenge. He figures it will start, and its the only way to get status. The flipside is the open letter a bunch of French Generals wrote predicting a violent, race-based Civil War in France. [About 60% of males under 30 in France are Muslim or black or both]What happens if France suffers a Muslim/black coup and starts killing the older Whites and enslaving the rest? White people around the world realize they can lose not just status but their lives. Gun sales are already proof of that.Bottom line Bio Leninism of the Western Distributed variety goes to mass killing very quickly at a tipping point, and then the rule by weirdos, freaks, minorities, women, gays etc gets old fast by the highest of needs. To stay alive.

                    There is a reason magazine capacity and auto-loading (semis) firearms have been high priority action items, but I think the ship sailed when a California had the Benitez mag ban stay for a week.  It’s hard to say how things would play out IRL, but a crowd of 100 zombies like we witnessed throughout summer 2020 would not win against a competent AR operator with a modest kit who knows how to shoot, move and find cover.NFAC orcs had negligent discharges, garbage firearms and march like red coats.  In truth, the orcs in LOTR were functional warriors albeit ugly and BLM and ANTIFA are lemmings.

        I believe Z touched on this before, but it’s amazing how many in the elite see themselves as victims.  In the political class, de Blasio and Lightfoot should be running their police departments more effectively. Instead they run around protesting the very departments that report to them, waiting for someone else to do their jobs. Cuomo orders sick people to be forced into nursing homes, and then blames Trump like he had nothing to do with it. AOC is gifted at getting attention, but that is mostly because right wing commentators love to give it to her.  Like Bernie Sanders, she will be in politics for decades and never pass a single piece of meaningful legislation

            If we’re being honest, it will only take one mistake of epic proportions to permanently put an end to the carny class. They can be tolerated (not liked, but tolerated) as long as things are good, or at least not bad. Starting a war that ends in humiliation and surrender, chronic shortages of common or essential goods, increased housing costs, a decline in health care outcomes or availability, etc. will end up spelling doom for the powers that be. It won’t happen tomorrow, probably, but it will happen eventually because no one can outrun their incompetence forever. The age of self-indulgence will eventually end, as long t has always done since time immemorial.

                One thing I do not believe gets enough attention in this regard, would be any supply chain disruption for mental illness medication. Earlier last year a family member had their medication disrupted through some fluke in the supply chain – was pre-Coronadoom- and the forced withdrawal was something to behold, to say the least.The past year into the present I find myself wondering what it would look like to have mental illness meds disrupted en masse during a time of upheaval. Certainly wouldn’t help things, to underplay it dramatically.The flip side is I honesty have no idea how supply chaining works for medications, or where they’re produced, so maybe its a once-off fear of mine that isn’t actually a threat for a certain segment.

                    And that’s an issue not to be taken lightly. Years ago I had a friend that took a psych med (forget name) that could cause serious issues if suddenly stopped — seizures maybe? We were stuck in a multi-mile backup on the local interstate, I decided to drive down the median (I had 4WD at the time) and if busted, I would use her need to stay medicated as a (likely) legitimate defense. As it turned out, I got away clean.
I suppose the risks could include permanent injury or death.

                Why do you think the establishment is trying to press through a third stimulus package in less than six months on a budget that’s already deep into deficit?
The math doesn’t hold up now.  We are in the collapse and it is all about positioning to survive the conflict financially, physically and spiritually.

        Sometimes I wish I lived in a time when it was OK, even admirable, for a man to be a priest, a philosopher, a warrior-monk, etc.
This obsession with mating has driven base materialism, peacocking— even feminism, I suspect.
It’s an ugly, shallow world, built to please the ladies, because if you aren’t getting laid, you must be a fag.

            It wasn’t too long ago, look at how the town  priest was portrayed in the Song of Bernadette.: and look how the real pope’s spoke:“And, indeed, there is one true and holy religion on the earth founded and established by Christ the Lord Himself. It is called Catholic, Apostolic, Roman by name, the fruitful and nurturing parent of all virtues, the expeller of vices, and the liberator of souls, the touchstone of true happiness. …Further, We ask of those who invite Us to extend [Our] right hand to today’s civilization for the good of religion whether the facts are of such a kind that they can induce Christ’s Vicar here on earth — divinely appointed by [Christ] Himself, to preserve the purity of His heavenly teaching and to feed and confirm the lambs and sheep with the same teaching — to associate himself, without the gravest sin of conscience and to the most considerable scandal of everyone, with today’s civilization, a great number of the undertakings of which (never to be deplored enough) turn out [to be] evil, [and by which] so many most shocking opinions, errors, and principles are promulgated, which wholly oppose the Catholic religion and its teaching.…This civilization, while it bestows resources upon non-Catholic institutes and persons, despoils the Catholic Church of her most rightful possessions, and employs all measures and efforts to weaken the salutary efficacy of the Church herself. Moreover, while it grants freedom to every utterance or written work that opposes the Church and all those wholeheartedly devoted to her, and while it encourages, promotes, and fosters license, at the same time it shows itself completely circumspect and restrained in censuring the sometimes violent and cruel procedures used against those who publish the best writings; and also it administers every severity in punishing, if it should think that the boundaries of moderation are being bypassed, even if lightly, by these [authors].Accordingly, could a Roman Pontiff ever stretch out a friendly hand to a civilization of this sort, and sincerely enter into a treaty and mutual agreement with it?…We plainly and openly declare before God and men that there is absolutely no reason why We ought to be reconciled with anybody.Iamdudum Cernimus. Pope Pius IX, Mar. 18, 1861

It would be hard to be a priest and worship God, or a philosopher and ponder the meaning of life but then take issue with God’s and nature’s “shallowness” in making a world where reproduction and all that comes with it are paramount

                I don’t think nature, or human nature, is shallow.  God created it, made us in His image. I do think society is exhausted, hollowed out.  Maybe that’s a better way of putting it. People today are hyper-sexualized, to the point that reproduction as the be-all-end-all of life is taken for granted, yet birth rates continue to collapse.  Maybe we’re trying too hard?

        A wise woman [the exception proving the rule?] I know has a canned explanation for the proliferation of social taxes the harridan horde and their travelers are piling on us: “Too much free time.”While brevity may be the soul of wit, certainly more is in play here, but on the whole, that nugget pretty much sums it up.  In the pre-tech days, when the business of business was running a business;  when operating a healthy government took talent and some modicum of virtue; when raising a family was a cultural duty and blessing, not a burden, there wasn’t time for idle hands–the carny folk were rightly reserved in a tiny niche, on the margin of society.  Their antics provided a momentary respite from work, but everyone recognized them as a guilty pleasure that one could only rarely indulge.Now, when merely existing is Sisyphean work, a daily circus is the only way many can endure the bankruptcy of social capital.  Degeneracy and daily despotism are the cultural parasites carried by the carnival folk set free from their tents on the outskirts of civilization.

            when merely existing is Sisyphean work, a daily circus is the only way many can endure the bankruptcy of social capital.If I am not mistaken, “bread and circuses” worked well in Rome to keep the plebs from revolting and it seems to be a functional solution today. Hadn’t thought about it that way but Reagan really WAS a carny. I remember when he began his political rise. The frequent response was “the actor?”. Hell! Even Ford and Carter wore the uniform at one time. Today’s con-artists (“con-ies” rather than “carn“-ies?) look down their noses at veterans. Most on the left consider us vetsFOOLSfor having put our asses on the line.(sometimes I think they are right)

                That is an unfortunate yet true observation on how veterans are looked at. Walk up to someone on the street in a major city and ask simple questions about our foreign entanglements over the last 20 years. Ask them to name a city that was fought over in Iraq. Name a province in Afghanistan where heavy American losses occurred.
They probably could not, nor would it be something that would affect their thinking. I remember in the early 2000s before 9/11 being asked why I didn’t get out of the military and start a “real” job.

You can watch the news for a month and still not know what is going on economically, in terms of foreign and domestic policy at the end of that time.
It’s a feature not a bug. The same reason public schools don’t even teach kids how to think and use logic or how to analyze the news.

                I liked Reagan, and can remember his run run for the Presidency in ‘80.  A number of serious questions were brought about during his candidacy.  1) He was divorced, 2) He would be the oldest President ever upon leaving office, i.e., he was too old. 3) He was a grade “B” actor, not really smart enough for the job, 4) He was not a true veteran of the ilk of Presidents before him.
My what a difference 40 years make.

                    It boils down to whether or not you believe Reagan was — or would be — on our side.  Opinions among the DR seem to differ, but I’m with you.  I liked him, I still like him, and I think he was a necessary prophet on the road to salvation.   There are lessons to be learned from both his successes and failures.

What I don’t like, and never did, was his wife and kids.  To have married such a shallow, solipsistic woman and to have produced such twisted children does not reflect well on his character.

                When politicians began seeing the military as just another tool to be used for gaming the system, well, instead of patriots in the ranks, we have…tools on the belt[way].My father was a WWII vet of the Pacific theater, and when I could get him to say more than three words on his service, it was always about the bond of brothers mystique rather than anything about patriotism per se.  It takes a special breed to put oneself in harm’s way and I wouldn’t and couldn’t disparage that sacrifice under any circumstance.A fish rots from the head down.  The futility many vets now experience is due in no small part to rotten leaders who place more value on the bottom line than human life.

                Reagan may have been a carny, but he did spend a lot of time developing a political philosophy, and wasn’t the amiable dunce the media portrayed him as.  He was Cicero compared to the current hacks who get their shallow talking points from the same source every morning, and mindlessly repeat them over and over.

        Back in the days, I used to joke that Trump could lock up 75% of the male vote by creating a Bund Deutscher Madel…and 100% of the female vote. Not to put too fine a point on it, what AINO needs is a strong pimp hand. Alas, of all the words of mouth or pen, the saddest are these: It might have been.

        “Over the last forty years, American politics has been taken over by actors, performers, producers, storytellers and so on. It is just a show.”
The champion in this theatrical farce is Barak H. Obama. In a slightly more normal world his role would have been as an evening newscaster on a television station in a medium-size market like Toledo, Memphis or Boise.

            No the truth that the GOP hated Reagan and did everything possible to stop his election. He was a carny but also a populist which the GOP hated and hates to this day. Hence they saddled him with a nasty globohomo drone GHW Bush who promptly reversed everything RR did once he was out of office.The fact NEITHER party at the time wanted to talk CONTENT. In fact if you sit down and analyze presidential and even senatorial campaigns they are remarkably content-free, They are dessigned that way to keep the electorate uninformed as possible. This is also  why they hated when Perot rolled in and started talking about real content instead of catch phrases.Trump was indeed a carny but he talked specifics during the campaign which the other empty suits could not do because it made them look like the evil SOB’s they are.

            The “Reagan admin” was dominated by members of Rockefeller’s Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). That includes VP George H.W. Bush, who was a CFR director (1977-79). Others include Haig, Shultz, Regan, Casey, Baldridge, Carlucci, Kirkpatrick and dozens more.
Fast forward 40 years, and the “Biden admin” is once again dominated by CFR members, including Blinken, Yellen, Austin, Raimondo, Mayorkas, Burns, Sullivan, Rice, Kerry, Psaki, and dozens more.

        Destroy the Internet and most if not all that plagues us will quickly wither away. The deeply malign socially corrosive Internet is the root of all evil. It provides an insatiable worldwide 24/7 Insta-reaction platform for cranks,weirdos,oddballs and the perpetually disgruntled to vent their spleen with very little moderation.I was talking to my mother the other day about this and she told me that when she was a girl there was hardly any coverage of American politics and culture. We heard of course about Watergate and we heard who won Presidential elections.  There simply wasn’t the exhaustive and excruciatingly detailed coverage of today.However many here won’t like the death of the Internet. They will say:’but muh email,muh online shopping,muh YouTube!’ However,if you want things to go back largely to the way they were the Internet must go the way of CB radio.

                “Just end the anonymity and bring back the ability to sue for slander.“And you will make this happen how?Maybe you haven’t noticed, but our new rulers and their minions have no need for anonymity – they say what they want under their own names and nothing happens to them – we’re the ones, including our host, hiding our identities. Why? Because this is not our country anymore and we have zero power and any of us could be the next person unbanked and unemployed and on the no-fly list. So changing the rules is not an option – we can’t even choose our president.And commenters above: How is it you plan to shut down social media, the internet and (!) television?[insert image here of a couple dozen old men shaking their fists at the sky]We’re not in the castle looking down anymore – we’re outside looking up. America sees us as the virus, the subversion, the dying baddies from the bad old days.We’re not changing any rules, we have no access to the means. Liberal Democracy has lead us to where it always leads, must lead – oligarchy – and we’re not in the new elite or among their preferred and protected masses.

                F suing people for words, to call the legal system inefficient justice is an injustice.  Give it to them in the yapper and shame them publicly.
The internet was perfectly fine and useful until social platforms were engineered for message manipulation post-MySpace.  Parscale was able to exploit the meme propagation architecture of social media in 2016 and Trump won because of it.

            Television needs to go too.  I was thinking yesterday that Americans have become walking sitcoms: stupid, vulgar, unrealistic, narcissistic and antagonistic.  We’re into our 4th generation of receptacles raised on sitcoms and it’s turned the average person into a slovenly, entitled, smartass.Social media has its positive uses but, on balance, it’s just too toxic. We won’t die if we go back to books, not having every little thing we desire at the click of a button, and asking our neighbors for help. The flickering screen, however, is a wildly pernicious menace which must die if we are ever to claw back some semblance of humanity.

                I am a late octogenarian and I was present when the first television showed up in my life. It had a shock like effect on the family’s reaction to daily existence. For the most part of my life, I have thought that Television was the worst technological invention of my lifetime and probably began the descent of culture into this abyss we have fallen into. The culture was introduced to a make believe- world and progressively destroyed their connection with reality and the world. Then began the use of narratives (newspeak, propaganda), plus a tsunami of corporate advertisement giving a false impression of both products and existence. We became cursed with this abominable group of narcissists (AKA Hollywood) who added their two-bits worth to this disaster. I highly recommend Neil Postman’s books on this subject.We then had added to this disaster, with the advent of the digital age and it’s gadgets. This ramped up what Television introduced to warp speed. We had the demonstration of this is full living color, with the power of all of this in the hands of madmen literally panicking the whole world with a narrative which is totally false. ( I am a retired physician and know of what I speak!) We are now awash in a culture that is totally nihilistic, materialistic, and relativistic. As a friend I had would state it: “everybody is getting all they can and canning all they can get!”

                    If you stop to think about it, whether intentional or not, the entire modern project has had the effect of breaking up the family unit and extracting wealth from the middle classForget all the obvious stuff used to break up the family and discourage family formation, such as promotion of homosexuality and demonization of Christianity and feminism.   But even something as seemingly innocuous as Social Security has played a major part in breaking up the extended and immediate family.Even something as seemingly trivial as taking silver our of quarters has bled the wealth from the middle class.Reminds me of CA.  No matter what they say or do, be it to save the environment or for whatever noble cause they profess, the net result is a steady and massive increase in property values for the rich.  In turn, the middle class is priced out and forced to rent.One big heist is all it is

                    You’re maybe not quite old enough, not that there is around anymore to remember the birth of broadcast radio, but…The generalization was that before sports radio people concerned themselves with politics.  Not that we batted 1000 (ahem) as WWI happened in the non-sports radio age, but that after that point (1921 according to wikipedia) people concerned themselves with sports talkies instead..

                        The pioneers of both radio and TV were David Sarnoff (RCA/NBC) and William Paley (CBS). Both were members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
Edward Bernays, assistant to Paley, wrote the following in his book “Propaganda” (1928):
“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.  Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country…”

            To be precise, get rid of social media. Prior to that the internet was basically a glorified file sharing service and a collection of  BBS style SIGs.I was there when it was Mil.Net and later when Andersen gave us Netscape which opened up the web to normies.The social and personal corrosion has always been a function of social media. It;s deleterious effects are well documented and people are warned to avoid it as it essentially rejiggers your nervous system for a need of continuous dopamine hits – hence why you see people’s faces pressed against their tablets to the exclusion of all else. They have have become the cocaine addicted monkey that keeps pressing the tab for more hits that we read about in psych 101 courses.

            Perhaps one day the internet will resemble the transporter from Star Trek and will have the requirement that if you wish to insult someone, you must do it in person. The lack of concern over physical reprisal has shown us how truly worthless and nasty are a great many. It’s easy to be brave when you know there will be no repercussion. This may be the great tragedy of the internet.

        So true. Consider the dating gurus whether online or in person dating. The gurus who mean well. What do they tell us? Attractive men are confident, independent, successful and charismatic, men who know how to work systems and people to get what they want. Attractive women are good-looking, perpetually fit and young, financially independent, aloof and disdainful of the men who vie for their affections. Nowhere is is mentioned honor, integrity, loyalty, devotion, truthfulness and the willingness and ability to hang in with each other during the tough times. Couples who love each other are a diminishing breed and “love” itself is on the lam. It’s Narcissus run riot among all the genders.

                “kissin’ don’t last-cookin’ do”. unfortunately men fall in love with their eyes, women, with their ears, which is why a good lookin’ bimbo can always find a man, and a smooth talking rogue can always get a girl.

        Darwin pointed out the importance of female preference in natural selection: the extent to which women’s choices determined the course of human evolution: of which men reproduced and passed their genes on, and which didn’t.Women have more to lose in the mating game, since they bear and raise the children. Especially in the days before birth control, what was a moment of pleasure for the man, could turn into a lifetime burden for the woman.An attractive woman will always have a multitude of men desiring to ‘lay with’ her. So women have always been the more valuable component in the mating equation: the ones who choose which men get to mate and which don’t.Back in the bad old days of patriarchy, women were incentivized to choose a man who could take good care of her and her offspring: who was a good breadwinner with a reliable character.But birth control and the welfare State ‘safety net’ has changed all that. Aside from the act of conception, a woman no longer needs a man to reproduce. If she’s poor, the State will pay for the costs of having the baby, and raising the baby; and the more babies she has, the larger her monthly check from the State becomes. If she’s unable to raise her children properly, the State will take them from her and raise them for her. When I worked at a homeless shelter a few years ago, I knew two Black crack whores who’d had 11 and 13 kids; all of whom had been taken away by child welfare authorities.And rich women too, no longer need a man to have kids. How often do you see a story about a “family” that consists of a single mother and her kids, with no mention of a father. A sociologist from Mars observing modern day America might conclude that a woman could reproduce on her own, without need of a male.So while in the bad old days, reproductive success generally selected for reliable, capable, competent  men, that’s no longer the case. Nowadays women are free to choose any sort of carny flake who catches their eye.

            I think this can be summed up as the Four Sirens of family collapse:1. Easy contraception2. No-fault divorce/divorce with cash &amp; prizes3. Female economic independence4. Collapse of social stigma/shaming of single mothers.
Taken together, these conditions have led to women being able to indulge their own sexual Id until around age 28-30, then settling with some provider male to pay the bills, who she may likely come to resent, or taking up with a load of cats.

                Indeed!
At one point back in the late ‘90s, I worked on a sales floor with a couple dozen other men. Seven of them were in the process of getting divorced by their wives. All were decent responsible people. Most of them had kids with the woman who was cutting them loose. Their wives had just gotten tired of them, and decided to ‘move on’.
Behavior like that, which would have been considered reprehensible on the part of the woman not that long ago, is now considered perfectly acceptable.

                    No, the cause is blank slatism and its traveling partner, egalitarianism.  If all women are equal to all men, what justification is there for any difference in their roles, rights, and responsibilities?  For that matter, if all women and men are equal, then the only difference is immaterial jiggly bits, and you can just materialistically rearrange those with a scalpel to make one equally equal being into another type of equal being.The Enlightenment was an error.

Also: two excellent books by female neuropsychiatrist and prof Louanne Brizendine— ‘The Male Brain’ and ‘The Female Brain’— document how males and females are radically different from conception onwards.

                    I think you’re conflating two issues. People on the lower-end of the “skills” spectrum often have kids for the housing and other bennies they bring in. It’s why couples don’t marry. This is a direct consequence of mass immigration and the cheap labor lobby.

                I remember the girl I dated in college before I met my wife. She was very attractive, had a great personality and was very caring. But she was assimilated into the Leftist/feminist collective in our college years (majoring in a STEM field and my attitudes kept that from happening to me) and when I told her that my priority was to have a large family with numerous kids with a wife postponing her career as my mother did by staying home, she was not enthused.She told me she wanted to get her Piled Higher and Deeper and then maybe have kids after she established her career. Emphasis on maybe. Nope.I dumped her shortly after and I asked out my wife, who I didn’t realize was interested in me until I worked up the courage to propose a date in Spanish class. Haven’t regretted that five kids later. She has a career, she just did it when our original four kids were in school. Our last child is cared for during the day (he’ll be in school in a few years) by both sets of grandparents.The ex reached out to me on Facebook and we talked on the phone about her life. She’s gone through a succession of guys, got her PhD and now she’s unemployed thanks to COVID and splitting time between her parents and her older sister, who married and had several kids. She sounded regretful as any childless woman in her 40s should. She even made an even more stunning admission that maybe she made a mistake and should’ve been more “flexible” about having a family.This is why I loathe feminism with a passion. It tricks nice women like my ex into thinking they can “have it all” and that a career is more important than birthing and nurturing the next generation. It just means you die alone with an angry, hateful vibrant stealing your stuff at the nursing home or even snuffing you out with a pillow.

                        Rwc1963:  The blame lies with second wave feminism – largely a Jevvish creation.  The corporations certainly picked up the ball and ran with it – anything to get more workers and thus lower wages – but it was the Jevvs and the Frankfurt School who worked to undermine the traditional family and traditional Christian morality.

                    Yeah, I lived with a lady who was a professor of psychometrics at a major University. She had her kids early, then pursued her career while raising them.
She had a couple friends who’d gone the other way: postponed marriage and family for career. They were very successful career-wise, but I got the distinct impression they were looking forward with regret to an old age spent alone, and looking with envy at my girlfriend and the choices she’d made.

            For millennia, everywhere, until only the last couple of generations, have women attained any kind of social equality with men. The “Cold War”, an effort to not only repel the international efforts of Communism, but also to preserve American culture, may have resulted in the demise of the Soviets but it also destroyed American culture. The very fabric of American life was torn to pieces by politicians buying feminine votes and American business recruiting women into the once masculine workforce. The Communists were incapable of producing such changes. Billions of US dollars were spent building missile silos, nuclear subs and immense floating air fields to protect the country from the Asian horde while its own elite class was intent on destroying it from within for political and financial advantage.This has now seeped across much of the rest of the world, which has a tendency to mimic the behavior of the US. The feminization of the planet, which as a necessity involves de-masculization, has been a Spenglerian catastrophe that pregnant fighter pilots, menstruating congressmen and skirt-clad CEOs have no desire to arrest.The great mistake was when men came to the conclusion that their women were allies in a social sense rather than a family one. No other member of the animal kingdom has made this fatal error.

            Your comment reminded me of something John Derbyshire wrote in a book review: “(…) In pure-arctic cultures, by contrast, food can only be got by sustained arduous exertions. The species can only survive in an arctic climate by sticking doggedly together in tight kinship groups, practicing strict monogamy and high-investment parenting.We in the modern West (our dinner guest argued on) are mostly people with arctic genes trying to adjust to a tropical culture. Not that our climate has changed in a tropical direction, but we have simulated a tropical climate by inventing equality of opportunity and the welfare state, in which environment — just as in pre-modern Micronesia or equatorial Africa — women don’t really need to have men around in order to raise kids. Instead of food dropping from the trees, it drops from all those well-paid jobs that women now have equal access to — or if all else fails, from the welfare office. All our current social problems flow from this mismatch between our genetic endowment and the environment we have created.”

                Women may not need men around to raise children, but children need men—as in male parents/role models—to grow up to be normal, productive citizens.  This is true even in the animal kingdom in some higher order species.
Outliers aside, much of our inner city tragedy is due to this simple fact.  Unfortunately, all the factors cited so far point/contribute to our increasing (across all races) propensity for out of wedlock births.  The overall number is now 40% (thanks to Whites’ lower percentage and greater population) but shows little slowing down.

                    Compsci:  Please don’t fall for this standard conservative trope.  The problems and dysfunction of the black race would not be solved or even heavily ameliorated by having fathers in the home.  Most of those fathers are equally dysfunctional and violently criminal.  They don’t provide stability or discipline or family unity.  Assuming having fathers around would solve much of our ‘inner city tragedy’ (I’d prefer to call it a farce) is to cast black fathers as White men in blackface.  Don’t go there.

                        Prove me wrong.  In the South, we don’t have the same dysfunction as in the North.  Cities aside, races aside, when you attempt to raise a boy in a single mother household, you are at much higher odds of producing dysfunctional male adults.
It certainly is worse depending on race, SES, and the potential for surrogate role models—but it is an observable phenomenon studied for several generations now.  And as I’ve noted, only getting wors.

                        In the middle of the 20th century, when negro bastardism was actually uncommon, our inner cities, our colored ghettos, while dysfunctional, were nowhere near the feral free-for-alls of today.  You can accept that the gains are relative to genetic realities, but it’s hard to argue against the benefits traditional marriages brought to blacks.

            Females on the plains of Sub-Saharan Africa do not require a male to support them and their offspring. One handed a female can easily gather sufficient food to feed herself and a single.offspring in a day’s time with time left over. Thus in Africa, “r” type parenting is the rule and “cad” type behavior (love em and leave em) as opposed to “dad” (i.e. monogamy) is the rule among males. It was only in the cooler northland that “K” type parenting and “dad” male behavior was selected for. Who we are is in our genomeand it is our genome which dictates our culture.

                That’s a preposterous thesis.  It might be true in Micronesia, But first-hand experience shows that sub-Saharan Africa is nothing like that in most places.

        A New Tomorrow (cont)The sea of humanity.Have you ever watched the sea of humanity leaving a baseball park after the game? Tens of thousands of ordinary folk streaming out of the gates &amp; onto the streets. Now imagine that at least few hundred have absorbed all the bullshit they can tolerate and will not take it anymore. But instead of pitching an angry fit to blow off steam (and incidentally drawing attention to themselves), they dedicate themselves to a more tangible solution. And they then choose to conduct themselves solely within the confines of their cranium and otherwise go about life quite normally. To the outside world, they are just one more fish in the sea. Their anonymity is both their shield &amp; strength. Yes, the Stasi can likely find a few, but can they find them all? When you lose the people, you eventually lose the war. Ancient wisdom.

        At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the only way this runaway train derails is via some sort of crisis that forces the hands of the majority to put an end to this infantile s*** show once and for all.It’s kind of like dealing with a recalcitrant petty criminal jonquarious – you keep slapping him on the wrist and cutting him breaks until he finally busts a cap on someone.

            It’s kind of like dealing with a recalcitrant petty criminal jonquarious – you keep slapping him on the wrist and cutting him breaks until he finally busts a cap on someone.So long as the one on whom he “busts a cap” is a D’auntacious or J’Quanda where is the harm? Black.leaders certainly see no harm in such behavior else they would raise a hue and cry against it.What we Eurasians would consider criminal, antisocial or even sociopathic behavior is encoded in Jonquarius’ genome. It is his birthright. Behavior consistent with civilization did not confer a survival advantage on the savannahs thus – in the history of our species (and I can accept it as one although 2 or even 3 works just as well) Black Africans have never – I say againNEVER– of themselves built a civilization. Causians? Multiple times. Asians? Again multiple times. Pacific Islanders, American Indians? Yes and yes! Black Africans? Sorry. Never. It simply isn’tINthem to do so.(In case you’re wondering, IMASSIVELYred pilled myself last week by following a link in a comment here to a little tome titled “Erectus Walks Amongst Us”. I also followed all the still active links imbedded in the work and read the footnotes. Not, on the main, a terribly pleasant experience – being red pilled seldom is – but truly an enlightening one.)

            usNthem:  I argued today (at Zman’s post behind the green door) that the standard ‘good man’ will not survive the coming unpleasantness.  That those of the DR  must harden themselves and, not become as criminally insane as the left, but perhaps be like the crusaders who are so castigated today.  Any mercy or generosity shown to the carnies and their minions is merely tolerating and propagating more evil.  They need to be terminated – and the mercy needs to be saved for those who have been or would have been their victims.

        Social media is a significant reinforcement of the problems mentioned here.  Prior to the social media age, it was much easier to isolate potential problem people and convince them they were nuts.  Now you can find reinforcement for any bizarre feeling or mood online and convince yourself everyone else is the problem.  The useless people waste their days online but think they are changing the world for the better.

            Yes, it is exactly that. And the media is the culprit, of course. Even speaking to my grandfather last night, the subject of Covid came up. He made mention of the ‘new Indian variant’: at first, I though he meant they’d found an asian that didn’t smell of curry, but then realised he was talking about a scary new viral strain. I said that I couldn’t verify this one bit, and did not care. It is so utterly unimportant, but the fire hose streams it out nonetheless.Now, I ask myself always two questions: Do I care? And can I verify it’s validity? Hardly anything passes the screening – it is mostly horseshit if I am honest. Perhaps even more staggering is the fact that most people seem to know and admit this, but run back for their fix nonetheless. Seems most people are looking for a cause, and most people want the cause the others are looking for. Makes ’em popular, see? Gives ’em something in common to talk about, see? Like the good old weather.Once you’re free of the fire hose, you’ve got more scope, more focus. But you’re still trapped in a world full of carnies dousing themselves daily in the hose, which makes everything that bit more of a challenge. That said, important things like local crime rates are of interest of course; but thenationalnewspapers are just chock full of bloody rubbish.

            Sentry:  Was dogsitting for my daughter-in-law the past few days and walked the dog around the block where I usually don’t drive when coming and leaving our neighborhood.  There it was – the one and only “Hate Has No Home Here” sign.  And, beside it, some sort of cloth penant with hebrew letters.  Unfortunately the dog had already done his business elsewhere.

        The “democracy “ in antebellum America selected its own leaders. I’ve been working on political letters for that period, studying the party newspapers, and there was intense organization and interest. Granted that there was not much in the way of media or sports to entertain, but a mass party meeting would always feature calls for just one more speech on the tariff. Rotation in office was a feature and politicians who lost the confidence of their party voters were soon on the outs.The key here was face to face organization. None of that exists now and our leaders select themselves. The results are obvious. You don’t know someone until you’ve dealt with him personally over time. Now we have media pop up personalities who disappoint us, and we wonder why.

        What is utterly amazing to me is that our current deviant Clown World© is a direct result of the success the Judeo-Puritans have enjoyed in pushing their social changes on the rest of us for centuries. Essentially, we witnessed a small group of self-absorbed, morality policemen force the rest of us to go along with their carnival tour. But it’s no longer good enough for us to be spectators. Oh, no…now we must become performing members to remain citizens in good standing. We have to prove that we have been “saved”. Our institutions have become deranged.

            Yep, our institutions have been taken over completely the small hats (carny grifters never designed to run the show but to manipulate for their own gain) and Puritan moralists (insufferable finger waggers who have taken on a religion that destroys societies instead of building them).
Neither of these two groups were ever designed to run the show. Their combination – small hats’ love of showmanship with the Puritans love demonizing people – is a match made in hell.

                Am I the only one to note a similarity here? Who was (perhaps still is) traditionally associated with carnivals, festivals, itinerant entertainments of all sorts? The Gypsies. Like the Small Hats, they are a highly insular culture, living at the margins of society. Unlike a traditional circus, which one could think of as a mobile work force, a Gypsy clan is more, it’s a complete self-contained society. Like the Travelers, the Gypsies live at the fringe of societies. Although the Small Hats share these sub-cultures’ insularity, they are not quite as mobile, and also have the tradition of either being valuable members of society, or borrowing into their host nation like parasites (take your pick.) Unless I’m mistaken, they have largely given up the bivouac lifestyle since leaving Egypt.

                The cultural saboteurs are very real, but they are postmodernists, not Frankfurt Schoolers. I used to think otherwise until I began delving deeply into those two movements. The Frankfurters’ influence was actually quite marginal and largely ceased in the late 60s, precisely when the pomos picked up the baton. They have been running with it ever since.

        Evolution never stops.
Case in point: the kakapo. New Zealand is unique in that birds filled a lot of ecological niches in their eco system. Suddenly, a species of parrot found it had no predators.
As a result, the Kakapo is a bright green ball of feathers too fat to fly. It waddles on the ground doing nothing but eating and fucking.
When the Europeans brought cats and weasels to the islands. They died en masse as they are naturally curious and had no fear of mammals.

What can a man do? A good suggestion from little old me: don’t meddle.Just looked up the bird. Apparently endangered as you allude to. Looks like it deserves to go on it’s merry way. I cannot imagine the working bird community thinks well of it and its easy life. The Kakapo may well be the welfare queen of the avian world. Actually, perhaps I’ve been a bit too harsh on it.

                    Saving “endangered” species here in the US is a big racket as it is codified into Federal and State law.  The grift is used by conservancy groups to block all types of human endeavor.The grift often works like this.  All species have a habitat.  Toward the edges of its natural habitat the species numbers are scarce.  The edges of a natural habitat vary over the years as the climate varies—enlarging and shrinking.When a human endeavor is desired to be blocked, say a mine, then the conservation folk claim that the project will further endanger some rare species of animal or plant.  Often they will trap or photograph the occasional species at the edge of its claimed range and use that as proof that the animal in question is endangered—because so few have ever been seen!That the animal in question is bountiful a few hundred miles South or so is not mentioned, only that it is rare in whatever area they claim.  With that kind of logic, polar bears are endangered in NYC.  This grift is good for holding up Federal and State agency authorizations and/or extracting mitigation funding from deep pockets—mitigation efforts to be undertaken by the conservation organization suing, of course.

There’s no fourth option where everyone lives happily together in some diverse wonderland. Natural – that cruel bitch – will never let that happen.

Enough of our genome will survive (and in the final analysis.what else matters?) the coming collapse of our current world-girdling civilization.to build the next one and success in said new civilization will be in direct proportion to how much of the Caucasian genome one possesses thus our tribe WILL survive! We evolved once we can damned well do so again!

                Brazil seems to have all 3.– the whites there are mostly at least 10% mixed with non-whites. The white category is very elastic.– the whites remaining there are somewhat tribal, but not to a great degree– they are slowly dying out as non-whites have higher birth rates and also decreasing in share Venezuelans and Haitians flood in as refugees.My guess would be that in 500 years or so white would not really exist in Brazil any longer. But they also don’t have toxic anti white hatred promoted at every turn nor are their kids brainwashed by CRT.Anglo-Saxon/ Germanic peoples also have never been keen on race mixing, Canada / USA more or less stayed pure white despite massive numbers of Indians they could have mated with. That’s a bit different than Brazil too, where meds seem more open to race mixing.

        Growing up in St. Paul in the 50’s and 60’s I never saw anyone wearing a fur coat. And, what other big city in the US other than in Alaska would you need one. When I moved to the NYC metro in the ‘80s I saw them everywhere, in a place nowhere near as cold.It dawned on me, though, that the public culture of the Upper Midwest is (or was, anyway) the Jantelov- a fur coat shows up your neighbors. If you want a nice car  get a Volvo or some such- don’t flaunt your good fortune.Very different in the Mediterranean dominated Northeast.

Somalis have one of the lowest average IQs in Africa aside from Bushmen and Sub-Saharan Blacks. The a Somali with an IQ right around average for their country would damned near  be considered borderline retarded if they were white.

            It’s even worse: read her biography. She is 100% “Newyorican,” father was an architect, mother no higher education. Presumably middle-class upbringing. She is claimed to be a cum laude BA, but in bullshit majors. Said degree apparently this qualified her to be a barmaid.Given her ethnicity, she is likely at best a midwit. The only indicator of high intelligence is the architect father. Regression to the mean insures that Dad’s smarts, if applicable, are not highly heritable.Alas, both Daddy and her own certifications must be assumed to have been skewed by racial preferences This is especially so in AOC’s case, her “education” having occurred in a time and place of maximal egalitarian dismantling of objective measures of quality.Conclusion: she is a well above-average example of her race, but by traditional standards would be at best average, or more likely, mediocre.

            Another reason AOC was selected and installed is that her features show up well on-screen and leave an impression in the viewer’s mind.
Regardless of whether you love or hate her, you find her attractive or hideous, she leaves an impression either way.

        Yeah, rule by carnies is called a democracy. It speaks to the need our culture has for increased levels of prejudice. A world where you wouldn’t listen to a carny because he is a carny is preferable to one where you feel like you need to listen and evaluate every argument the carny makes because it’s more efficient and allows less room for error.Similar disease with these guys who are determined to judge everyone on his own character. I mean, yeah, but pretending you don’t have a prior expectation is pretty stupid, but that’s how it goes.In the next age, we are going to have to figure out how to put carnies back in their place and that probably has something to do with stronger class-based prejudices.

            In the next age, we are going to have to figure out how to put carnies back in their place—That is the thing, and I do like the Z circles around from time to time to beat this drum as this is a severe issue with no obvious “out”.  It’s a symptom of mass media: the clown that’s on the magic glow-screen all the time as awaylopsided influence on their society.  However, at least knowing that they are clowns/carnies that does remove a large part of their mystique, not sure though if that’s long term solution to their wealth and/or screen time.

        People probably recoil more against celebrity “culture” now more than 20 years ago, but the rot is too deep and the effects irreversible. Take social media (please). It has expanded Warhol’s “in the future everyone will get 15 minutes of fame” to 15 hours daily. Many of the same people who righteously roll their eyes at some celebrity cretin’s latest moronuc uttering have no compunction against hopping on Facebook to hold forth about meta politics or asparagus casseroles.The biggest carnies are billionaires now, bored to tears and desperate to do much the same as their minimum wage employees do on social nedia, albeit with an infinitely bigger megaphone. Princess Picaninny and her sidekick Harry’s Oprah minstrel show bests illustrates the Ruling Class’ retarded degeneracy. While far fewer watched this shitshow than would have a generation ago, arguably Royals would not have appeared on a fat, idiotic African’s platform back then, either, to trash the monarchy.Even when it was great, the United States sporadically was a freakshow. People, again, have.groemwn to dislike it but  genies, bottles. The old saw was thst serious times make unserious people serious, but that no longer applies to those in the positions that matter

        I remember 20 years back when the 1950’s were mocked by derisively referencing the housewife and ‘mommie’s little helper’.  In current times, a recent study stated 50% of American Liberal women under 30 were diagnosed by a doctor with a mental illness.  We all know the fertility rates for this demographic too.It will be interesting to see what happens when a society puts pressure on traits that are far less likely to be able to pass off their genes, even when they have the power and status to make this seemingly trivial.  This isn’t just among whites either, all all races, though white women are the hardest hit.   People with the ability for a powerful interior life and aversion to propaganda are going to see their genes become more prevalent in the next generation.  We’re also going to see people with a strong preference for radical tribalism and, paradoxically, aversion to technology gain reproductive success.On the flip side, we’re also going to see disingenuous weasels who advocate white genocide while having five children gain a genetic advantage in their traits.

Who are these fertile weasels? Even the US black and hispanic fertility rates are below replacement levels.
Who is having lots of kids? The Amish and other conservative Christians.

This is where we are at. Even the people writing about this say he should keep his opinions to himself. Think of that, these people who can’t STFU about anything and shoving it our faces, say this. The cherry on top is the little fags statement “I’m gorgeous”.

            They enjoy being provocative, and the “culture” now allows them to rub it in everyone else’s face. Dude should have just complained to hotel mgmt about the “loud and obnoxious” behavior in the common area, instead of taking the bait and confronting them.

            That video distills a problem that many of us have all lived through. You observe a person who is behaving in a way that will damage your way of life if that behavior is widely adopted.  Your instincts tell you to confront that person or at least make your disapproval apparent.You are met with a chorus of short sighted people ruled by their immediate feelings of sympathy for that person.  “Stop, stop, please…”  “It’s his special day!”  “Don’t let this one thing bother you.”  “Was it really worth it?”And most ironically, the recording phone that led to his firing.This video distills the experiences of many conservatives with homo marriage in the 2000s.  And we lost.  And now it’s trannies.  Male on male pederasts next.

            I watched that documentary as well. It doesn’t surprise me, what I remember of the night she won the primary was the fact that in her victory speech she went on ad nauseum about how it was a “Victory for her people”. Stating that, among other things, “You chose one of your own tonight. Those white, soccer moms of thirty years ago who helped elect Bill Clinton, they’re yesterdays news, they’re the old America. Our people are taking this country back from them and thirty years from now, they’ll be the minority.”I’m paraphrasing, but this is essentially what she said. I searched for the video, but can only find one of her speeches that night and it did not contain this. The speech I’m referring to is one that was given outdoors.

        I saw an article that something like half of Millennials moved back in with their parents over the last year.  That article included quotes from a 39 year old childless woman about needing the security of her childhood home.  I was amazed that Millennials can be as old as 39 now.  But I was more amazed by the fact that a generation of truly dysfunctional people, who, like Fraulein Occasio-Cortes, really have almost no ability to function outside of social media and urban nightclub culture, feel like they should lecture humanity about everything.  Some obese blue haired lesbian living with her parents in her 30s thinks you should drive an electric car and not eat meat.  Great.  Ultimately, everyone calls their dad for help with their rent.  A nice dad won’t make you feel like crap for having spent all your money on booze and netflix etc.  But the fact that their dads aren’t living in carny world and can still support them tells they whole story, which was also told in the story of the prodigal son in the Bible.  Ultimately, these young people deserve the misery of abject poverty that is about to befall them.  They contribute nothing but absurd opinions and shopping trends to society.  Fortunately for them thus far, Capitalism doesn’t need anything from them other than that they keep shopping in the same way that the carny doesn’t need anything from you other than that you buy a ticket.

            The real long term trend in America, and maybe all ofthe WestIs infantilization.   The maturity level of society as a whole recedes a little bit every year.  In my lifetime, we’ve gone from pointless rebellion and licentiousness to middle school bullying to a craving for parent ally provided security and fear of imaginary monsters.   Half a decade ago, I joked that the next stop would be people hunkering down in a fetal position with pacifiers – then COVID hit, and the joke became terrifying instead of funny.I’m not sure what the next step in dedevelopment will be, or where it ends, but I’m afraid we’re going to find out soon enough.

                You’re correct: the State has become everyone’s Daddy.
When men no longer need to be capable and competent, and women no longer need men to raise children, infantilization of everyone is the natural result.

            I see these young people, as annoyingly lecturing as many of them may be, as victims. They were poisoned by the education-media-Hollywood complex while their parents were too busy making a living to notice. Many parents shrugged and consoled themselves that all youngsters are getting this treatment, hence no disadvantage to their own. Big mistake. All society suffers as a result.

                    It could be worse:So a man walks into a bar, and sits down. He starts a conversation with an old guy next to him. The old guy has obviously had a few. He says to the man:“You see that dock out there? Built it myself, hand crafted each piece, and it’s the best dock in town! But do they call me McGregor the dock builder? No!”And you see that bridge over there? I built that, took me two months, through rain, sleet and scorching weather, but do they call me McGregor the bridge builder? No!”And you see that pier over there, I built that, best pier in the county! But do they call me McGregor the pier builder? No!”The old guy looks around, and makes sure that nobody is listening, and leans to the man, and he says:“But you fuck one sheep…”

                It’s even worse: the prodigal can pull the entire family down into the ditch with him. I’ve seen first-hand the doting father that in 1980s, paid drug dealer son’s (2 of 3 in family!) $40K hospital bill because son didn’t have health insurance and probably would have lost a leg (sepsis) otherwise. Unemployed Daddy had to further suck out equity form his already-encumbered home. It’s wonderful when the Prodigal son turns out like it does in the Bible. Even I was something of a Prodigal, albeit not the one described above. The point is that, in some percent of cases, the parents are too enabling and their misguided rescuing of offspring brings ruin to all.

        The result is a political economy that strikes most Americans as boring in the academic socialist sort of way. Generations of selecting for people inherently humble and eager for comprise means their politic-economy reflects the nature of the dominant type on these societies.That’s the flip side of the Jantelov. The upside to the dictum “you’re not to believe you’re anybody special”, is that (West)Scandinavians are allergic to pretentiousness. You’re only a hero in Denmark as long as you’re self-effacing and discreet about money. If you give yourself airs, people will laugh at you: “Who the hell do you think you are, prime minister?”

                If you have ever had the joy of riding the subway in one of our highly diverse and enriched megacities, one of the more entertaining aspects of that observation is how our dusky brethren, obsessed as they are with the hope of one day bedding down a white woman, will routinely walk up to women and launch into the whole “you a fine lady I want to get to know” routine.  All by itself, this pattern of behavior, i.e. small talk explicitly intended to get a girl to have sex with you as soon as possible, drove most women who could afford it from public transportation.  Growing up as a white kid in the midwest in the 80s, it would never have considered just walking up to random women and asking them for sex.  Moving to a diversely enriched megacity really opened my eyes to that behavior.  It always blew my mind to consider that they constantly do that because it probably pays off every once in a while, which is of course why Black people in America are something like 8 times more likely to have a venereal disease than white people.  They are constantly walking around talking about sex.  Small talking about it everywhere and at all times.

                    There are a few hundred employees where I work and the demographic breakdown tracks very closely to that of America as a whole.  Twice in the past few years, there’s been titillation over an employee dick-pic scandal.  One time it involved a jogger and one time it involved a donut puncher.  What are the odds, eh?

                    I live in an outer suburb in central FL. My area’s Black infestation, pardon me, population is about 5%. So they stand out in the (Thank God!) mostly-White areas I frequent. I’ve witnessed precisely the behavior you describe. While most Homo erectus display remarkably White-like behavior in public, it’s the single men that gall me. At a restaurant I often eat at, a Black man was smiling, talking to the hostess outside (it was good weather, outdoor seating). From his behavior, it was clear that he had no intention to eat there or even enter the restaurant. I was too far away to hear conversation, but from the body language he was likely on the make.If there’s anything to be thankful for, they usually move on after a short time. Occasionally their mating attempts are successful, evidenced by mulatto children occasionally in tow by White (Trash) women.

Look at the mass media we export and what young women have been trained to do voluntarily via their social media. Instagram/tiktok whoring, black fetishizing everywhere.
Its a reasonable assumption.

                Same in South Korea. Walking in the neighborhoods or riding the incredible public transportation of Seoul, there is no eye contact or smiling or anything unless the person knows you. No random small talk. Lots of personal respect, especially the older you are (though not a lot of personal space). Extremely low crime. Very homogenous.I lived with my wife in Seoul for a few years and she marveled at how a country that was devastated and poor only a few decades ago could be so modern and well organized and safe. She would ask “how do they do it, when we can’t?” and I’d answer simply, “They’re all Koreans” or sometimes just, “No Blacks.”

            That was/is apparently the ethos in hunter-gatherer societies as well: bragging and making yourself out to be exceptional was considered bad form, while sharing the fruits of your hunt with all— without making a big deal of it— was what you were expected to do. Braggarts were mocked and shunned.
But I expect the women were probably still attracted to the best hunters….

                    The White man’s magic has produced a society of such material abundance that the cost to women of making the wrong mating decisions is increasingly minimal.

                This is a curious racial – psychological – emotional distinction. Nature gifted Blacks with some strengths that, on average, are better than other races. Not just certain sports, physical prowess. Low inhibitions is related to emotional openness. This is “good” for emoting in acting, song, other entertainment. The Negro often has a mesmerizing delivery of speech or song, appreciable even to non-Blacks.Alas, the very traits that allow the free flow of “good” emotions provide little impediment to violent emotions and all too often, ill-considered actions. Hence the propensity to violence (they have at least 6x the murder rate of Whites, in USA).Blacks are supposed to have very high self-esteem. Perhaps, as a race, they are the epitome of the Dunning-Kruger effect: They are dead last in most cognitive ability measures, but perhaps Nature has compensated them with an unrealistically optimistic self-image.

                    It’s darkly funny to remember that the explanation for poor black performance in the 1990s was low self-esteem.  Imagine believing that blacks need higher self-esteem!
I saw a study recently, probably on Audacious Epigone, in which different racial groups were asked to rate their attractiveness.  For all groups except blacks, the result was a normal bell curve.  For blacks, almost all of them believed that they are above average in attractiveness.

                        And yet, on social media dating sites—if still allowed—Blacks are rejected the most as potential referrals.  Rightfully so, but that’s got to be telling you something.  Every other race would prefer to avoid them.
