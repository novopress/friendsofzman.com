        http://mpcdot.com/forums/topic/7699-revenge-of-the-dark-enlightenment/“As Foseti notes, people actually calling themselves reactionaries is a recent development.  Part of this is that it’s not a very nice thing to be called (it suggests unthinking opposition), and part of it is that it doesn’t mean much politically.  While we can say, for example, that a liberal is in favor of greater freedom and equality, and a conservative is in favor of conserving social and political institutions, a reactionary is either just another word for conservative (in which case it is useless), or it is an ill-defined not-ness.In support of the latter definition, each reactionary tends to drift untethered until he washes up on his own island of fuddy-duddy affectations, distinct from that of other reactionaries.  He then tries to work out why these fuddy-duddy affectations are the best, convinces a handful of other weirdos, and–another neoreactionary blog is born.”

        Your observations about NRx coincide with what I have learned about the movement.  At first I hoped for some truly new conservative insights but instead I found insider jargon, obscure references,  smug, faux intellectualism, and very little practical knowledge about the movement.  The commentators prattle on and on and I don’t really have time for such self absorbed tripe.  Sorry NRx, you just don’t seem to have it.
