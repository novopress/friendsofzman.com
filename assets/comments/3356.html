        “This is obviously a planted story. The idea is to discredit the dissenters in Europe and America, by connecting them to Hitler 3.0 or whatever we’re up to now on the Hitler chain of existence.”
Bingo! It is Anne Applebaum working for the jewish deep state.

        “The one big reason English speaking people came to dominate the world is a willingness to identify, recruit and cultivate fresh talent to keep the ruling class vibrant.”True enough. it is also relevant that when the Brits built their empire there was not the level of micromanagement we see today. People like Clive went off and did their thing and eventually a letter would arrive back in London detailing what he had done. By the time the reply got to India Clive had done a whole lot more.Today our communications makes it possible for lots of managers and other ‘experts’  to say “no” at once and so freelancing is a thing of the past.

        We seem to be seeing a boiling off of the sort of talent that has made the West dominant. Instead, the ruling class is increasingly dominated by box checkers good at colouring between the lines, but incapable of seeing the whole picture. Anyone showing the spark of originality is hounded out before they can become a threat.This is not a new thing in history, but it is new in Anglo-Saxon history. The one big reason English speaking people came to dominate the world is a willingness to identify, recruit and cultivate fresh talent to keep the ruling class vibrant. But as I’m fond of saying, we have become a different sort of Iran. A religious cult has taken over and debate is therefore forbidden.

        Don’t play chess with a Russian unless you’re Bobby Fischer, who was crazier than Spassky. The wildcard we have always been able to play has been our crazy military guys-Patton, John Paul Jones, LeMay, et al. I don’t know if we have any like them in our military right now, but I sure hope so because Putin is not the least bit afraid of us. And neither are the Islamists. They’re laughing at how weak-kneed we are.

        Putin does not see it necessary to apologise for his nation: they are what they are and they know they can tough out a few harsh winters or cold shoulders. Some other ‘leaders’ however feel it is their duty to grovel before the world and feel even weaker than usual if people don’t like them a lot.

        It may be a simple analysis, but check the obvious between Obama and Putin.  Your eyes don’t lie.  On the one hand a virile, fervent nationalist, macho heterosexual leader,  on the other a sloop shouldered, national apologist, metro sexual (at best, more likely bi-sexual or homosexual) panderer.  Can you guess who is who?
