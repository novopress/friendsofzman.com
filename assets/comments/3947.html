        What’s worrisome is how they are openly socialist.The cold war may just as well have never happened.…Except yes, for Apple, even tho they are THE biggest company by market capitalization, they get a pass.p.s. do you take requests, dj z?I would like to see a post, your take/comment on this 1983 lecture about ideological subversion by a former KGB agent:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fQoGMtE0EY“The main emphasis of the KGB is NOT in the area of intelligence at all, only about 15% of time, money, and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85% is for a slow process we call either ideological subversion or active measures.What it basically means is: To change the perception of reality of every American that despite of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions. That process is legitimate and open, you can see it with your own eyes.”If there is one must see thing on YouTube, it’s this.The fascinating part is how that snowball is still rolling, even tho the entity which originally pushed the pebble down the hill is long gone.

        I have to say the generation preceding the millennial’s era was  instrumental in the development, or non-development as it were, of their attitudes.Once the preceding generation understood ‘da yoof’ had money and paid-for influence (even if it wasn’t paid for by the kids themselves but their parents) the older ones began to openly embrace the cult of immaturity. Instead of the young being seen as future workers and expected to achieve adulthood as soon as possible, the kids were allowed to wallow in an eternal childhood. Tantrums and selfish urges were tolerated and encouraged. immature views were lauded and featured in the media: seeing kids of 19 with no life experience being interviewed in the MSM and warmly praised for saying stupid, shallow things that lacked understanding is an unpleasant experience. You can sing to a degree and squawk mumble noises into a microphone? We want to hear what you think of global issues. If the youngsters used dismissive slang because they couldn’t be bothered, or had never been taught, to articulate and be precise, then the media embraced the same outlook too. It fed the young solely a diet of the same as they were.Incidentally, by dismissive slang I am including the one thing that irritates me increasingly: the use of a phrase such as “Know what I’m sayin’?” No, idiot, how can I know what you are saying? You aren’t communicating so am I meant to play guessing games with what I perceive as your ‘style’?(When I heard an immature reviewer — allegedly a comedian — on a moderately well-informed BBC radio critic’s programme using that ugly, useless vagueness when talking about a book I knew we were doomed.)So, I blame those who went before the millennials. If they hadn’t been so indulgent, so willing to take the money, so eager to absolve themselves of responsibility, it is hardly surprising the how many of the under-30s turned out.

            UKer, I watch some British TV. I’m a fan of Top Gear and I cannot get over the lack of vibrancy on the show. I don’t just mean the color palette of the people on screen. I mean there’s no hint of the lingo or mannerism from the the American vibrant community. It’s very weird to watch people on TV speaking English who look like me and sound (sort of) like me. No one is playing with themselves or asking me if I know what they are saying. It’s disorienting.
