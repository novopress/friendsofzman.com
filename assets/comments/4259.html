        If I were Chief I’d have thrown this guy to the wolves also. Would you have not, really?
Now it may be that this Chief is a gutless wonder doing the right thing because it was easy,  I don’t know, but it was not the wrong thing.. There are rules of conduct which one cop in five-ten-twenty-thirty can be counted on to not follow. A swift and certain message protects the integrity of the remaining cops. Protecting him gets you more of those cops.

            If I’m in a leadership role of a small town and the Eye casts its gaze on my town, I’ll conduct a human sacrifice if that’s what it takes to get the gaze off my town. There’s an old Chinese curse, “May the government become aware of you.” Today, hell is having the Social Justice League become aware of you. This town is doing what it must to avoid having the mob burn down their town.
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

                It won’t do them any good. There are going to be riots whatever happens.

        All this theater is even funnier knowing that in reality cops are 25 times more likely to shoot whites than people of any other race, according to a study by Washington State University-Spokane (which barely received any news coverage). Police officers actually hesitate before shooting blacks due to real-world concerns over discipline, liability and public disapproval.

        Think Rhodesia a poor example. There are 200 million white people in this country. We will be a minority-majority country, as they say, but that’s still a lot of white people. The one issue is this: There seems to be one — and only one — ethnic group not getting with the program. We don’t have ethnic issues with south Asians or East Asians. The Mexicans work hard, for the most part. Yes, there are gang problems, I agree. Even AFRICAN blacks get with the program.We don’t have a race problem. We have a problem with one ethnic group–a group every other ethnic group can’t stand. And they are not going to be the majority any time soon. If anything, Asians and Hispanics will be less forgiving toward them than whites have been.Hispanics, well, I don’t know. That’s a separate issue, but whatever the problems, they aren’t as serious as with black Americans.

            Having spent time south of the Rio Grande, I don’t think those countries are the way they are because of chance. They are the way they are because of their populations. That’s one point to keep in mind when thinking about the future. Tens of millions of Hispanics moving north will bring their culture with them. California is a great test case. A land dominated by northern Europeans who moved there from the Midwest became a land dominated by people from South of the border. It now resembles Puerto Rico in its governance. That’s a second point to keep in mind.The third point is that not all white people are the same. That’s very clearwhen you look at maps. That’s why Rhodesia is a good place to study. Whites there were no universally committed to maintaining control. Their sponsors in Britain had decided to cut them loose. It was the inability of whites to adopt racial solidarity that was the undoing of Rhodesia.Is it a perfect analogy? Of course not. No such thing ever exists. It’s worth studying because Charles Murray is most likely right about America balkanizing along ethnic lines. He is most likely wrong about white adopting racial solidarity as a group survival strategy.

                I agree the white urban left are “those who are no longer our fellow citizens” Throw in the dopes, dopers, deranged bitter middle aged shrews, “wiggers”, disability cheats, etc. and we definitely have a white collapse.The stalwarts are mostly dying off. I think what’s left on our side are a lot of military vets, gun owners and Christians. That’s still pretty formidable. Be interesting to see how the military and police will fall if the shite comes down.
