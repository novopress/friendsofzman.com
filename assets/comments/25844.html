        i don‚Äôt think logocide is intentional, or works as intended if it is intentional.  maybe the ruling class really is incoherent in their thinking and their speech?   this is just the byproduct of their rule.also, people route around central control efforts.   how much guidance does the ghetto take on language issues, or narratives?  they just do what they want, as usual.   so you can cow normies into following your crazy talk rule, that‚Äôs a normie for you!  but normies don‚Äôt matter, so cowing them might be amusing, but you haven‚Äôt accomplished anything useful.  the people that matter aren‚Äôt about talk, anyway.

        For anyone inclined to conspiracy theories, or even just some inductive logic, I‚Äôve always thought that the sheer consistency and effective psychological manipulation generated by leftist terminology must emanate from some central location somewhere. If the Frankfurt School were still in business, I‚Äôd point to that as prime contender. But there are certainly other candidates, Tavistock, SAGE, Rockefeller Foundation, CIA, fill in the blank.  The most likely is one hidden away, or hidden in plain sight.  Its job is to take the current pulse of the peons regarding some issue, devise semantic memes and buzzwords to nudge the masses appropriately, then disseminate it to key gatekeepers and further down the chain. For no other reason, you have to admire the left over the decades for its consistency and cohesiveness of message.  A covert semantic manipulation factory would be a great force multiplier in the culture wars.  ‚ÄúHe who controls the language controls the masses.‚Äù Saul Alinsky.

        I think Z Man is blowing out of proportion a very real thing.
I agree that the language is being degraded. But where I disagree is that this has any real effect on the majority of people. The majority of people don‚Äôt watch CNN. They hardly watch news at all. And to imagine that politicians are the idols of the people, who get looked at and aped, is way overboard. I imagine a handful of liberal losers are like that, but even on the liberal side there‚Äôs a limited effect present.

            I think his argument isn‚Äôt out of proportion at all. It‚Äôs spot on.  Have you noticed the enforced language and the subsequent public discourse shift around BLM (and various nu-Marxist ideology), and most especially the language control related to COVID-19? It‚Äôs outright redefining racism and censoring science for political ends. The regime control of language is also used to tamp down on all discussion regarding discrimination against whites, or redefining citizenship to squelch any concerns over free-flowing illegal immigration, and so much more.Unfortunately this is not just cable news like CNN, instead it‚Äôs literally any and all media ‚Äî from sports to entertainment to news to children‚Äôs tv ‚Äî and it is currently everywhere and in every facet of society.  It would be a lot easier to roll back if all of this were just the weasely politicians and a state media organ.  The reality is that the policing of language to follow regime talking points has crept into every major cultural institution the left has captured (which is to say: all cultural institutions). It‚Äôs further amplified by social media where (even when not outright manipulated by algorithmic sleight of hand) Good Think is reinforced by millions of Karens and Kens getting their dopamine hits from likes, upvotes, and follows.The vast masses of the unawake-to-marginally-awake who have otherwise just been clueless thus far are precisely the types who are easily influenced by regime propaganda revolving around language control. Their every waking hour is simply saturated with regime-approved messaging and thought leaders who neatly circumscribe ‚Äòpolite discussion,‚Äô and point the way. In this environment, nearly everyone with a contrary view is silenced or made into an undesirable (or made an example of, if need be). Most of the masses will subtly but most assuredly ‚Äòself-censor‚Äô to conform to the perceived and regime constructed new normal, because they either don‚Äôt care or can‚Äôt understand the final destination.

The university, school boards, NBA, NFL, MLB, NYT, NPR, PBS, Netflicks, advertisers, Google, Facebook, Amazon, BLM, churches, boy scouts, music, military, Pentagon, FBI, ..the air we breath. The verbal bombardment will continue and intensify as necessary until the last apostate is eliminated.

        The problem the regime has is two-fold. One the dullness and nothingness of their ideas makes it repellent. There is nothing in popular culture that even inspires any more, indeed the destruction, deliberate, of heroes as varied as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Indiana Jones, and Captain Picard so people will ‚Äúlove‚Äù the replacement has failed, spectacularly. Any vandal with a hammer can destroy something beautiful, but a hammer does not inspire or create love and devotion. Or even respect and admiration. Only fear, and then only when the hammer is wielded.Two is that people tune out the dullness. Dominic Cummings says ordinary people are (unlike the regime elite) overwhelmed with information so they tune things out. That to understand how people view the news watch it with the sound off. Massive filtering is a result of constant lying since well, the dawn of the consumer age. That throw-away line in ‚ÄúChristmas Story‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äòdon‚Äôt forget to drink your ovaltine! A crummy ad!‚Äô is telling. Nothing of the modern era inspires. Or would galvanize sacrifice. Given we are looking at 40+ years of inflation and scarcity and hard times, something will fill that gap guaranteed. A running gag in Top Gear was the Jeremy Clarkson was ‚Äúpunished‚Äù by the producers by doing a driving race with the only CDs being the speeches of Margaret Thatcher. People have been lied to all their lives on TV and now the internet by ads and more so they assume its all a lie. Its why people are holding up signs at Biden‚Äôs motorcade telling him to F- off and that Trump is the real president. They got told a lie (elect the doddering old man and it will all stop) and are the audience at the final Sex Pistols show (‚ÄúEver get the feeling you‚Äôve been cheated?)

        A friendly little reminder here that the  translation of Tikkun Olam, per David Goldman, is not ‚Äúrepair the world‚Äù.
Tikkun Olam, literally, means ‚Äúto change reality‚Äù.
This last century is theirs.  The century of central banking, democracy, and genocide.
They built the system of global predatory vulture capitalism and totalitarian religious communism.
This is the Perfected World.  As their founding story says, they thought they could do better than us.We, who were building pyramids in Alaska 12,000 years ago- because at least one such pyramid is still there.

            It can also mean ‚Äúto rule the eon,‚Äù as arguably is happening.
Hebrew has very few words, especially compared to English, which is super-absorbent of other languages‚Äîas Hebrew isn‚Äôt at all, less so than any civilized language I can think of. That odd linguistic habit of mind is probably how Jews became lawyers, poets, comedians, and good at the old SATs. All of them require comfort with ambiguous (and more) word meanings.

            My foolish young mind thought the humiliation of that speech doomed his career.  He was widely ridiculed for it but he owned it and used it to his advantage.   In that same election cycle I also remember thinking that Joe Biden was done after his complete humiliation from the  Neil Kinnock speech theft.

                I learned that Biden is a rage-addled retard when I was a literal child. It‚Äôs one of the first ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù ideas I remember having, maybe the first time the real-life news impinged on my kid-brain. 1982-ish, I think? Bad day.My final ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù idea‚ÄîI don‚Äôt have them anymore‚Äîwas that the last, decisive way to tell real leftists from fake was if they supported Biden in 2020. There has never been a more fascist (in the pejorative/evil sense) American politician. Turns out there are no real leftists and politics isn‚Äôt really a thing. I always knew that, but now I *know* it.Biden has to be the single most unimpressive human being ever to be an important person. There were more evil ones, and there were dumber ones, but never such a combination. A fitting end for us? Probably.

        While ‚Äúcrossdressing‚Äù describes what the person is doing, I would argue that clearer words to describe that person would be either ‚Äúpervert‚Äù or ‚Äúinsane‚Äù or both.

            All those words‚Äî ‚Äúpervert‚Äù, ‚Äúinsane‚Äù, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù‚Äî are soon to be outlawed, as hateful ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù.Prior to (IIRC) 1973, homosexuality was listed in the DSM as a pathology. Then, suddenly‚Ä¶.BINGO! It‚Äôs PERFECTLY NORMAL!And the people who still look at it as abnormal, are INTOLERANT HATEFUL BIGOTS.Likewise ‚Äútransgenders‚Äù: they used to be seen as seriously-confused people, suffering from gender dysphoria. Not any more!Now it‚Äôs the ‚Äútrans-phobic‚Äù people who are the perverts! How sick can you get?

                Pretty sure the people controlling the American psychiatric association and western psychological study in general are closely related to the people who have a stranglehold on the media.Seems as though a high percentage of those people before 1973 would have been considered to have pathological problems.The lunatics are running the asylum.

                As a Paleocon , I‚Äôm also something of a   social conservative . So yeah I did. we were well warned well back into the 80‚Äôs maybe before.Also given our culture the fact we went Wiemar shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone. Even now a plurality of our population is Anglo Saxon in at least part of their origin as is much of ruling class and our social decay is liable to mirror Anglo Saxon trends.Ultimately the best victory the Left ever won was convincing the Right that individualism is a Conservative value by convincing people that Community rules are the same as Communism. That was genius level  manipulation.If and only if the Right can get over that they can take power away from the decaying Left but adopting a tribal,  , community and group oriented mindset maybe a religious one too will take effort.Getting rid of trust and the focus on money will come first though and that will protect anyone but the dumber Civ Nats and whad‚Äôya call em? Grillers from the griftersStart with calling out anyone who says Conservatism is an Attitude (ConIA)  making  it clear that person is a liar,  and just a Liberal in disguise and the the Country Clubbers and Chamber of Commerce types are amoral if not outright evil and hate American workers.Real Conservatism is policy, pro family formation, Male and Female and preservation of Western values,Everything else is  B.S.Eventually we want to get to  the point where noxious Libertarians  be pushed into the sea and the ConIA- Country Club-Chamber of Commerce types can be made a last meal of their bow ties . If we are very lucky, metaphorical.

                The simple definitions of normal and abnormal make homosexuality and transgenderism abnormal. If normal means, ‚Äúthe usual, average, or normal state of condition,‚Äù then heterosexuality is normal because something like 85-90% of humans are heterosexual. If you have sexual proclivities that only 1% of the population has, you are by definition abnormal. This, the word will likely be outlawed as you remarked.

            But you cannot assume either perversion or insanity from simple weirdness. Ed Wood may have been insane but he was not a pervert; Liberace may have been a pervert but he wasn‚Äôt insane.Language ‚Äì and I think this is the point Z is making ‚Äì should start with ordinary words used to describe what one sees in front of one‚Äôs nose; I remember when we referred to border-jumpers as ‚Äòwetbacks‚Äô.

            I realized the Yankeedom were the original Woke.  They overthrew the South, but did not take the freed blacks back home with them.
Imagine yourself as one of those emancipated.  Your entire like you had food, shelter, a role, a place, even your own little village at the end of the day.
Now, the South is bankrupt, their money worthless.  No white can employ you because they are broke and often homeless too.  How are you going to feed yourselves?  Where are you going to live?

                One of the Civilian Conservation Corps projects back in the  Great Depression was going around interviewing former slaves. Their interviews make great reading.
It‚Äôs notable how many slaves reported being worse off after Emancipation, and yearning for the good old days when all their needs were being met.

            Back in the bad old (pre-Floyd) days, it was understood that with every right, comes a corresponding duty. E.g.: I have a right to carry a gun, which includes the corresponding duty to do so safely.
But somewhere along the line, ‚Äúrights‚Äù became ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù: something that I‚Äôm entitled to, with no strings attached.
If someone wanted to plunge America into coast-to-coast rioting, all they‚Äôd have to do is bring down the welfare system computers, so that all the EBT cards stopped working, and ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù checks stopped arriving. Mayhem!

            I tend to agree. One sticking point of libertarian thought is their principled argument that rights are immutable even if exercised to the detriment of the individual or society generally. Thus, if one owns, say, a cheap car, it‚Äôs their right to neglect it‚Äôs maintenance because they own it, even though a poorly maintained car is much more likely to wreck at an inopportune time, to the detriment of other people. Obviously, viewing the decision of neglect through the lens of ‚Äúgood‚Äù would lead to the conclusion that is a generally good thing to, say, require that drivers using public roads do so in a vehicle that is in reasonably safe condition.(Note for the especially Asperger-y lolbertarians that sometimes show up here: the opposite extreme, which is to say perfect collectivism, is just as wrong. The criticism of extreme individualism is not a de facto defense of extreme collectivism.)

                I don‚Äôt quite see why you blame the Libertarians for such excess wrt ‚Äúextreme individualism‚Äù and ‚Äúdetriment to the individual‚Äù.  I know nowhere in the US where Libertarians hold much, if any political power‚Äìstarted in 1971 they peaked in the presidential election of 1980.  Yet, we seem to have the homeless and drug addicted everywhere‚Äìespecially in the large population centers.Stories and documentaries abound about how these folks live (for a brief time anyway) in drug addicted degradation that the same society would not allow a dog to live in.  It‚Äôs a shame, that I agree, but it‚Äôs not the Libertarian that caused this, nor was it Libertarian philosophy that took some hypnotic hold of reasonable folk‚Äìthe mental asylums began to close as psychotropic drugs took the place of mental institution commitment in the late 60‚Äôs, early 70‚Äôs.Rather it‚Äôs duplicitous politicians from both parties that promote such behavior under the guise of freedom and liberty, when the real reason is budgetary considerations and inept governance.

        As the prophet Derb and others even more ancient have pointed out, for most people fidelity to truth was very much subordinate to espousing ideas and a worldview that complimented a persons emotional alignment. We can see it has been demonstrated once again, on a worldwide scale, that for most people the exercise of freedom, freedom of action, of thought, is very much subordinate to feeling safe and taken care of by others, a general sense of alignment with the herd. A form of government emphasizing self sufficiency and the personal responsibilities of freedom is at odds with the mean of human nature, a distribution with a very narrow sigma it would seem.I had been thinking of White Identity as a narrowing of the definition of the herd so that it may be led in service to the will of a leadership that has not yet appeared. The example of other identity groups with informal or loose leadership yet effective group strategies for prospering and success suggests the importance of the emergent behavior theory that has been pointed out here. We can cultivate a heightened race consciousness bolstered with less emphasis on truth and freedom and more on affirming the emotional needs of the majority for stewardship and a sense of belonging. On the negative side we ( and they) already do a pretty good job of emphasizing the other-ness of competing identity groups but we should work towards institutionalizing it more effectively. Create a poetic mythology from current events that instill the sense of identity through persecution and conflict and teach it to our children. Express these myths and parables artistically. Do not feel bound by any overdeveloped sense of fidelity to truth because most people don‚Äôt care about that. Christianity has plenty of examples to emulate and espousing the language, ideas and cultural inheritance from this foundation modified in recognition of the demonstrated toxicity of its universalist aspects.

            I‚Äôd suggest that we already have all the ingredients for a valid (defendable) ‚Äòmythology‚Äô about Whites: seeing as how virtually every advance that, taken together, make up human civilization as we know it‚Äî in geographic discovery, science, technology, government, philosophy, the arts‚Äî all were the achievements of White people.
We ARE the super-race, as far as achievement goes. That‚Äôs just historical fact.

                This is the particular hell of our times, where we are forced to see ourselves as a race and not as a peopleWe can‚Äôt even enjoy the differences, be they ethnic or temperamental, amongst ourselves because we are forced to see ourselves as a race, like a particular breed of tree that loses all of its unique traits because we are forced instead to see it merely as a tree.  Just another green blob like all the rest of them.  This itself is a form of a lie.  It‚Äôs a slap in the face of our Creator, whoever that may be, but who went to the great effort and time and expressed such boundless creativity in making this world.   And for what, He has to ask?  So you can ignore all of my hard work and insult me?  Can‚Äôt even give me the simple dignity of at least appreciating my work?  It‚Äôs just ho hum, nothing to write home about?  You ungrateful pieces of shit.We are getting away from what became apparent beginning in the renaissance when the observations of details and uniqueness and differences in every little creation were given the recognition they truly deserved.  And no wonder God shone on them.No, this racial crap is getting out of hand.  It is selling us short, it‚Äôs an insult to the cosmos if you want, to the Creator if you want, to Mother Nature, and we are going to pay the price for it.   But I get it, once we integrated ourselves with other races, as the case would have it we were forced to put on the blinders and see nothing but race.  And it‚Äôs going to kill us.  Or be the death of us.  We have to separate. We have to get back to being people amongst ourselves where ‚Äúrace‚Äù no longer applies or matters.Yeah I know I may be sounding a bit like E Michael Jones here, but in this sense he is 100% correct.  As long as we live among other races we are nothing more than a simple green blob or a white blob in a sea of humanity.  And that‚Äôs a big fat insult to all of us and to our forebears and our posterity.  And I believe the heavens agree and why we are being punished, if not intentionally then out of some kind of necessity.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.‚ÄùObama seemed to believe he was an omnipotent deity. It is remarkable how little we know about him as a person given the fact there was a massive cult of personality worshiping of him. That one dimensional character successfully stoked the fires of anti- Whiteness at every turn.
We went from a bizarre Barry Hussein Soetoro enigma to:‚Äúonly Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äù is a fat pig, slob, dog, disgusting animal.Trump disappointed and fell short but he did have so many great, unscripted lines.

            The early 80‚Äôs didn‚Äôt have interlinking systems we have today, including universities.  It was easier to create fake personas.  There‚Äôs a reason he dropped Barry Soetero for Barack Obama back then and reading an article several years ago, someone I think probably nailed it.  He was a minor coke dealer at Columbia.  He was probably arrested for coke dealing, or possession or whatever, and decided to change his identity soon afterwards, including a fake SSN from CT, his original perhaps being in his arrest record.  The NYPD was still using a paper filing system at the time, and at some point the file, with his original name and arrest, is sitting with a million other arrest files in some dusty warehouse, never having been input electronically to this day.  It would be like finding a needle in a haystack of early 80‚Äôs arrested junkies, larceny, prostitution etc.

                Obama like Biden was merely a vessel for the ideologues or whatever we want to call them, the people steering the ship with a clear direction in mindMy impression of Obama, well a few things, was that he more or less told everyone ‚ÄúYou want me to be your face?  Then you do the work, I take the arrows, but I get paid and get paid well.  Deal?‚ÄùHe also gave off the impression, when people were complaining about the economy and small businessmen and the anger toward his ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt build that,‚Äù his attitude was ‚ÄúWell if you don‚Äôt like then YOU run for office and do what I did.  I thought you white people were so great? Right?  Then let‚Äôs see YOU run for office.  And if your life sucks then that‚Äôs your damn problem.  I don‚Äôt want to hear about it‚Äù. And I think that goes for pretty much every black person who runs for office and ends up holding ‚Äúbad‚Äù whites in utter contempt.  But notice how they pretty much slobber over white people who DO run for office.  They do in fact seem to worship white politicians or the ‚Äúgood‚Äù whites, perhaps or really undoubtedly whom they see as the deserved masters of the plantation, their masters, so goes their thinking.  Notice how they suck up to the rich.‚ÄúIf you are not in politics, you ain‚Äôt shit.  If you are not in rich and in control then you ain‚Äôt shit.‚Äù  The black mindset and attitude in a nutshell.  You see it with Obama, Lebron, all of em.

        ‚ÄúA people living in fear of their own curiosity are not inventing new ways to solve problems. ‚ÄùThis probably comes about as close to a one-sentence explanation of the overall technological stagnation we‚Äôve seen since the early 1970‚Äôs as anything we are likely to get.

And one can certainly make the case that Trump lied as much as Obama: saying what he knew people wanted to hear in order to get elected, then abandoning his promises once he got in office.

        ‚ÄúThey lack beauty, creativity and vitality because those are burned up in the engine of authoritarian rule.‚Äù ‚Äì Architecture is a reflection and summation of the cumulative values of society.  Take a look at the hideous stuff they‚Äôre vomiting into existence these days.  It‚Äôs ghastly.  One thing you may have noticed is the warmed over early 60‚Äôs esthetic to the newest construction and the monochromatic gray interiors.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coincidental that the JFK era was the very high watermark of the current regime.  In a sense, the regime is desperately attempting to re-create its high water mark as it continues its slow decline.  And if this is architecture was their high watermark does this not indicate that this entire regime has been an anti-human, spiritual slum since its official setup in 1933?

                    ‚ÄúProblem Glasses‚Äù- it is a meme, just FYI.
Along with danger hair (eccentric hair colors), visible tats, excessive piercings, etc. they act much like nature in that they are a visual indicator and warning sign that you are dealing with an animal probably best avoided.

                The current architectural phase is called ‚Äúindustrial modern‚Äù which harkens back to mid-century modern (MCM). MCM (or ‚ÄúMad Men style‚Äù) was truly a great style, full of clean lines and woodiness and a touch of color. It is mostly taken from Scandanavian, particularly Danish influence.
The dreck you see in industrial modern is all glassy with metal-brutalist overtones. The good stuff will still use real wood, but that is a happy exception. But mostly I feel like I‚Äôm going to get a rectal exam in some of these new office buildings.

            That was my impression when I went to the new Los Angeles SoFi stadium.  It looks like what a person in the 1960s imagined the future would be.   That same 1960s futuristic aesthetic.   And it was designed not from the inside out but from the outside with the inside an afterthought, to look good from people flying overhead to LAX or to look neat from a blimp flying overhead on Sundays.  Inside there is nothing new about any of it, and in fact it is poorly laid out.As if there hasn‚Äôt been any new architectural vision since.  And maybe there really hasn‚Äôt been.  I have yet to see one.  Or they are going back to the 1920s with repurposed brick warehouse and loft chic which took over Los Angeles beginning maybe 10 years ago.  They‚Äôre still doing the ‚Äúcreative‚Äù loft look.  That design style is now rampant in every small and mid size city in the country.  They are ALL doing it now.Otherwise, current architecture seems mainly a variation of the BauHaus aesthetic but with some advances in materials science allowing them to vary the color or size of the window panes and glass walls, using steel in new ways, and tinting things with new colors while underneath the bones are still adhering to the form follows function aesthetic.In housing the issue is similar.  Notice how so many modern rich person houses look like offices or have the decor of a casino.  Nothing warm and homey about any of it.With smaller houses you get a style that, like the SoFi stadium, was clearly designed fro the outward first and then all the rooms are shoehorned in as afterthoughts or as secondary or tertiary considerations.  And the ‚Äúopen concept‚Äù where the kitchen and living room comprise 50% of the square footage and, as a result, the bedrooms are small.  While the master bedroom may be large it is incongruously so, and much of its square footage is devoted to closets.  But looks great from the street!Stepping into an old Victorian or Georgian home is to revisit a world when homes were designed around people, not around ideas or concepts.  Things make sense.  There are proportions.  There is an understanding how people flow and walk and live, and these homes accommodate these tendencies.  Rather than shoehorn them into some modern architect‚Äôs half-baked vision where the people are really nothing more than those sterile drawings of people you see produced by architectural software.    Now with computer games everywhere, the houses that look good and make sense virtually are being replicated in real life where the people naive enough or duped into buying them can‚Äôt make sense of the interiors and you can‚Äôt even find enough wall space for a bookshelf, sometimes even the large screen TV doesn‚Äôt quite work, where does the bed go?  But they sure looked damn good on the architect‚Äôs laptop.

                Very thoughtful overview.  I can only imagine the car break ins at that stadium when its done.  I guess the seats are in.   Even as a kid I was struck by the cheapness of modern architecture.  I was raised in a modernist home from the 60‚Äôs.  State of the art at the time, not one natural fiber, and I found it to be cheap and boxy.  I‚Äôm still very anti sliding glass door and don‚Äôt get me started on decorative cinderblocks.  Comparing it to a nice hacienda style, like what they were doing in the 20‚Äôs or something like that, there‚Äôs just no comparison.  I think part of the Covid work at home movement was just people recoiling from ugly spaces.

                    I was on many a Zoom call keeping touch with people and seeing them in these sterile white wall boxes they call apartments was a huge downer, and I would feel like garbage for a day or two.  That‚Äôs the effect it had ‚Äî on me.  On them it had to be much much worse.  Just a crying shame what the authorities are doing to people.  If someone is already not strong to begin with, with no support, no job, no social life, yeah they are going to start overdosing and drinking hard and whatever else.  What the authorities have done to these poor people‚Ä¶.   and nothing happens but I hope something does.  And it probably will.  I can‚Äôt imagine the world I love and have known all these years, seeing how she always seeks to balance things out, doesn‚Äôt have something in store.

                I see Section 8 (rent-controlled) housing like that. All hard right angles and boxes. It speaks to me of the current Socialist mindset. Compartmented ‚Äòtruths‚Äô not allowed to interact. Everything built to official standards with no warmth or curvy relaxation. Everything is technically perfect and emotionally dead.

        This is a very interesting article, and I think it is substantially accurate. I would, however, emphasize more strongly the communicative complicity between the regime, and the media, Hollywood, academia and corporations. Biden alone is hardly capable of wreaking the linguistic damage and destabilization of truth Z describes. It has taken a concerted effort by Washington, Wall Street, Hollywood, Harvard, the New York Times and Silicon Valley to do this sort of damage.As an aside, the best example of the destruction of a word is ‚Äúvaccine.‚Äù By the word‚Äôs meaning throughout its history, a vaccine was an injected substance that prevented one from contracted the disease in question. What the Power Structure is passing off as a vaccine simply does not do what vaccines are supposed to do, and the Power Structure even admits it. They are no longer claiming their ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù prevents one from contracting Covid; their claim now is that it merely reduces the severity of the illness. It is, therefore, at best a medicine, or more likely a palliative. And yet, the Power Structure persists in calling it a vaccine. The word has been destroyed.

            They did the same destruction to the word, ‚Äúpandemic,‚Äù which is now far looser so they can continue this scam.
I think the concerted effort to do this is a mix of intentional planning, some following their Marxist programming, and some instinctive herding behavior.

            Did you notice that ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù was named Webster‚Äôs word of the year, although they don‚Äôt point out the definition is now completely and inherently different than what is was a year ago.
The definition of a ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is now ‚Äúa preparation of genetic material (such as a strand of synthesized messenger RNA) that is used by the cells of the body to produce an antigenic substance (such as a fragment of virus spike protein)‚Äù.
Note that there is nothing in that definition about preventing or even ameliorating infection, or in fact, any mention of why a ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is given!

        The primary skillset needed to mantain a ‚ÄòProgressive‚Äô point of view, is the art of Not Noticing.You can see what they don‚Äôt want you to know,those truths they‚Äôre doing their best to hide,by watching how they use language; specifically, what they leave out:An obvious (mis)use of language to distort and obfuscate‚Äî rather than to describe and clarify‚Äì is the passive tense so often used when reporting crimes committed by Blacks:‚Äúgunfire erupted‚Äù‚Äúgun violence escalated‚Äù‚Äúshots rang out‚ÄùAs if ‚Äúgunfire‚Äù, ‚Äúshots‚Äù, and ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù were independent entities, acting of their own accord.It‚Äôs not violent psychopathic Black thugs with stolen pistols:  it‚Äôs ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù ‚Äúgripping the city‚Äù!Or this from Yahoo news, describing (or not!)the multiple murder of White paraders by a deranged Black career criminal:‚ÄúOn Sunday, a red SUV drove through barricades and smashed into crowds of people at a Christmas parade in Waukesha‚ÄùMust have been one of those self-driving cars‚Ä¶.We‚Äôre allowed to know the color of the SUV,but NOT the color of the man driving it!Because revealing the race of criminals might exacerbate those ‚Äúracial stereotypes‚Äù!

            The statistics on black violence don‚Äôt lie, but the sycophants of the left never read past a headline of their favorite propaganda machine.  CNN told me that if Kyle Rittenhouse was black he‚Äôd have never made it to trial.  Reality shows a much different view.  A simple google search will land you dozens of blacks who committed outright murder and got off clean just in the past two months.  That little bit of effort to search for the truth has been completely removed from our society.  Not only that, but if the truth with the supporting data points is presented to these morons, they simply dismiss it as ‚Äúnot my truth‚Äù.  This is because they now have to confront the idea that their belief system is a fraud and that is far too traumatic to deal with.

                If Rittenhouse had been Black, he never would have been charged. Likely they would have charged the surviving atracker.
While Blacks are murdering innocent Whites at roughly one a day, the NYT is still reminding us about Emmett Till!

                        One of the most gobsmacking features of the postmodern Left is its utter rejection of all knowledge and wisdom accrued before roughly 1900, and the concomitant belief that current mores trump basically the whole of human history. It seems never to occur to them that they have created a bizarre epistemological oxbow of falsity and madness, and that, perhaps a century henceforth, everything they have written and said will be utterly and irrevocably discredited. Normalcy will have reasserted itself.

        I only started noticing the assault on language maybe about 6-8 years ago.  That is when I started noticing the same turn of phrase showing up everywhere. That was also when I started really noticing how so much of the mass media was loaded with emotional language and narratives. But I started noticing the drop in quality and formality a long time ago.

                        Because that guarantees that Sha‚Äôniqua and her fellow blacks will be forever supporters of the Santa Claus regime.Just look at the voting demographics as an example.  It is a pointless exercise to attempt to appeal to black America if you are on the right.  They are the most tribal.  No matter what proof was surfaced, OJ was innocent.  If Obama promised to murder their spouses in their sleep his first day in office, they‚Äôd still have voted for him just because ‚Äúhe one of us!‚Äù.  They are a hopeless group.  My journey to this side of the great divide culminated when I finally had my moment of clarity that they‚Äôre far too different from us, and that a civilized society cannot be had if it panders to blacks and black behavior.

                        People in general, and especially around here would be outraged if they knew just how many ‚Äúprograms‚Äù are available to these people that they simply refuse to avail themselves of.Responsibility is for someone else, particularly someone else who actually cares.  These women do not care.  Their kids are noting more than an abstraction that they ‚Äúlove‚Äù in a very abstract way.I actually knew one of these types of women. She was running her mouth one day about her kids, kids she says she would do ANYTHING for.  But when she said it, she meant it in a hyperbolic way, like I would kill someone and accept going to prison for my kid.  But the one thing she absolutely did not care enough about her kids to do,  was to stop using drugs or stop prostituting herself.  Of course, these people are felon factories. All of their kids are going to end up on drugs and having children they don‚Äôt care about and going to prison.There was an organization who traveled the country and paid junky women to get  the 5 year implant or become sterilized.  The money they were giving the women wasn‚Äôt much, like a couple hundred bucks.  Of course, the press went nuts and were doing hit pieces on them (that‚Äôs how I heard about them).  I think they were called project prevention.

                        We need to promote that this makes our government deeply immoral. Honest, straight laced, and responsible people in this country are tethered like oxen in order to carry those that behave and act irresponsibly or deviously. Most serious investigations into disability and welfare fraud have gone by the wayside and everything is rubber stamped. Believe me, I have a relative that‚Äôs committing disability fraud, along with many of his friends, and it‚Äôs not terribly difficult, as he‚Äôs not a high IQ individual. Creators of the numerous hate crime hoaxes almost never face repercussions. Having tons of children is cost prohibitive for you or I, but profitable to welfare recipients. The country is immoral for punishing the honest and rewarding the dishonest. It relies on and takes for granted our honesty. We need to start throwing sand as often as possible, which includes gaming the system I. Any way possible.

            It‚Äôs why I cannot for the life of me consider these people elite in any true sense of the word.  They live in a world of pablum and cliche and cant.  Animated only by some unfounded anger.

                Well, at least now I know why Klemperer would write such a treatise.  With perfect objectivity, you betcha.That‚Äôs the rub, the lesson, Anna.The bad guys won.  Not just in 1945. In 712 BC.With Abraham.  With Jacob. With Moses.  With the province of Judah.The radical 20% successfully purged or carved away from the 80% majority that had wanted to join with the greater White civilization above them.  They had sought white brides to the point that they themselves might appear a branch of White.Yet still, that radical 20% demands that they think of themselves as one race, without distinction between the generations, as other nonwhites do.They insist the formerly polytheistic J**ish tribes must submit to only one god as supreme, the God of Abraham- even though even that god‚Äôs name has changed many times.Whites think of themselves as branches.  We separate the good from the bad.  This, the nonwhites- such as radical Hebraics- cannot do.No matter how evil the deeds, nonwhites claim one of their own as one of their own.They are not us, and they cannot understand us.  The nonwhite wiring in their head gets everything twisted, inverted, and upside down, though Nature itself has compelled them to want a piece of us in themselves.There‚Äôs a reason everyone who breeds with white gets lighter.  We are meant to be, like it or not.  We are the Uplift.You may join, but you must not be above.  Nonwhite pulls souls back into the neverending animal cycle of the purgatorio and the damnatio, to the quarantine inside the greenhouse.

        Excellent piece. To my mind, no single group is more guilty of cognitive meaninglessness than the Harry Jaffa/Lincoln was a demigod/US is the Hegelian apex of history/the US is always on the side of muh freedom school. In other words, the operating ideology of the Republican Party. It‚Äôs a peculiar form of gnosticism and needs to be completely suppressed, eradicated and discarded. The damage that man and his school did with their Lincoln myth (that the lonely sage in the long prairie nights discovered, Strauss-like, that the Founders had all along meant ‚Äúequality‚Äù to be the urgrund of the American ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù is almost beyond reckoning. The existence of Victor Davis Hanson, for example, but I could go on.Not related, but I always begin my day with reading the latest Z-post (and the very learned comments) with a nice cigar made of Nicaraguan tobacco, Highly recommended. Davidoff sells an excellent ‚Äúprima‚Äù that does the job quite well. Someday, Z, I hope to enjoy a cigar with you.

        What a great post today!  In thinking about the magical negro, obomba, he was as vapid as they come as were his speeches.  In my mind, people weren‚Äôt really focused on what he said, but how he said it ‚Äì the tone and cadence.  Many were probably thinking (without realizing it), this black dude can really speak ‚Äì he sounds just like a White guy.  What could possibly be better?On another note, this destruction of language and truth is especially visible in the covid farce.  Every covidian parrots the same lies and BS and continues to double and triple down on it.  No amount of contrary evidence regardless how stark makes any difference to these robots.  Vax good, anything else, bad.  Unvaxxed dangerous, must be dealt with accordingly.  Vaxxed good and pure.  You just want to scream at the never ending group think

Can‚Äôt make this stuff up.  As I tell all the Covidians, when you see the cowardly politicians in hazmat suits hiding in containment bunkers, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs serious.  Instead, they‚Äôre partying, laughing, always mask-less while telling everyone to stay home and get the jab.  No Thanks.

                Yeah, Obama was the Magical Negro,the ‚ÄúSee, they‚Äôre no different than we are!‚Äù candidate; whose presence gave GoodWhites an opportunity to virtue-signal and display their tolerance and lack of racism. Obama could not have been elected without a majority of the White vote.Which made it especially funny when he and Michele kept harping on what an awful, racist country America is.I can sort of understand gullible Whites voting for him the first time around, before anyone knew much about him‚Äî though I certainly didn‚Äôt!‚Äî but what really bummed me out was watching America elect him to a second term!.

        It‚Äôs a good rule of thumb that the longer the document, the less meaning it conveys.  It‚Äôs also a truism that the more people involved in writing a document, the more pointless blather you can expect.Committee meetings, consensus building, and other contraptions of the mass bureaucratic state only serve to make the decisions so vapid and meaningless that no one can object, because there‚Äôs nothing in the document of substance to object to.This applies even to technical things, as one can tell when a design document was written by a single person because it is clear, crisp, and concise.  If the person is incompetent, there‚Äôs nowhere to hide.  You then get reviewers who iron out some flaws and give clarification.The ones that start by committee are bloated, ambiguous, and almost universallyreject the KISS principle.

            Everyone remembers his preacher style of speaking.  I can hear the voice in my head with ease.  What I can‚Äôt hear in my head coming from Obama are any meaningful sentences uttered.
The closest I can remember is him making some backhanded comment about gun owners, which was neither clever nor presidential.
Trump, on the other hand, I can pull up a dozen things he said, in his own voice.  Not just because I am closer to him ideologically, but because his pithy delivery was so excellent.

                Chet:  In all honesty, I really can‚Äôt recall his ‚Äúpreacher style of speaking‚Äù because after trying to warn those idiots I was still speaking to of his hubris and Maoist/Stalinist beliefs back in 2008, I think I listened to him speak once for perhaps a minute or so.  Pretty much stopped watching tv news thereafter and stuck solely to the internet.  My husband, who tortured himself with more Fox News back then (not any longer!) referred to him as grey gums.

                    Obama‚Äôs anti-White streak was always really visible to anyone willing to look.  It was always what I disliked about him from the very first time I ever saw him.  His way of speaking only ever rubbed me the wrong way.  The press fawning all over him and their endless praise of his way of speaking always seemed to me to be a bit of overcompensation, like they were expecting him to speak in ebonics and were impressed that he could read 3 syllable words in his speeches.

                It‚Äôs funny, I rarely listen to political speeches, so I‚Äôve only heard a couple minutes of Obama speaking. Trump, too.
I do this for a reason. The theatrics and emotionality of live speaking cloud reason. If you read a transcript, you have to deal with what was actually said, devoid of stagecraft.

                He mispronounced too many words for that job.
In about seventh grade I had a professional-voiced mystery ethnic geography teacher who couldn‚Äôt pronounce any Russian names correctly, and he didn‚Äôt follow the transliterations in a ‚Äúhooked on phonics‚Äù way either, so the Russian-familiar and the conventionally literate among us were constantly confused and annoyed. Enough parent complaints piled up that he was promoted to dean. As such he gave our daily morning intercom announcements and on our birthdays mispronounced most of our names.
Hearing Obama always brought me back.

        Aside from two (elective) courses on political philosophy in college, my 100% government school education never had a course in logic or anything even near the subject.It was not an accident that the smart kids in my high school and the masses at the flagship university at flyover state were not taught this.My freshman son at his fundamentalist boys school has learned more in his 3 months of Logic than I have in a lifetime as an autodidact.So there are pockets of hope in the world.But the pockets are laughably small in a sea of depravity.  Like the Germans at the end of WWII, all of your synthetic rubber, jet engines and chemical fertilizer will come to naught if the barbarian blows up your factory or pokes you with a sharp stick.

        Another quality I‚Äôve noticed about modern language is the deification of certain terms and concepts. Certain terms become emptied of nuance and lose their literal meaning. These words become idolized, which kills thought and leads to primitive forms of magical thinking in the user. I‚Äôve noticed this occurs often when a term become used as a proper noun.For instance, Science is no longer a human concept, a practice or method of study. Rather it is a god to be worshiped. Science is the god of knowledge. We ‚Äúfollow‚Äù Science. We are not ‚Äúanti‚Äù Science. We are on His side.Equality is a goddess now as well. She is probably the highest and most beloved god on the pantheon. She is inherently good, and eternally fruitful.On the other hand Racism is the god of the underworld (I think he resides somewhere in middle America, which, as every good Progressive will tell you, should be nuked). He is the eternal enemy and opposite of Equality. He must be destroyed, and all his followers shall be stamped from the face of the earth.Earth is now a goddess as well, her name is Gaia. We must constantly appease her irrational and inconstant desires. Yesterday she demanded we use less oil or else she would plunge us into eternal winter. Today she demands CO2 tribute from the plebians or else she will raise the heat and plunge us under water. Tomorrow‚Ä¶ who knows about tomorrow!The Socratic method is the best method of destroying these idols. However, when you question the gods, expect violence from the believer.

        First, the eloquence of today‚Äôs post, and the density of important ideas therein, is almost overwhelming. Where to begin? I guess I‚Äôll go cosmic.I often use the cancer analogy to describe the seriousness of our cultural and societal decline, and a fair assessment of our current status is late Stage 3 or early Stage 4. And today‚Äôs post is a good exemplar of the insidiousness and pervasiveness of the cancer‚Äôs spread. The Crazy is everywhere and imitating healthy tissue so it appears normal and benign, but is actually killing us in slow motion.As with real biological cancer, we cannot cure ourselves incrementally because the cancer is growing faster than any tiny-steps remedy. This is why voting harder or persuasion-at-the-margins is doomed to fail. All you accomplish is to delay the inevitable and ensure a lower bottom with greater pain (if not outright death of the host). It‚Äôs passed time to end the denial phase about our illness and start thinking about chemo.

            Yep: and the first step in treating any malady, is correctly diagnosing it.
That may be the most damaging effect of the craziness that pervades America: it prevents us from recognizing what ails us.
If we misconstrue the nature and source of the disease, we have no chance at figuring out a cure.
We can see an example of this in the California school systems spending billions of dollars and countless hours over the past 40 years, seeking to ‚Äòclose the Black-White performance gap‚Äô in schools. They imagined the cause was environmental‚Ä¶

        The great irony is that corruption, censorship and limitation of language makes everyone a potential dissident. When everyone is a political dissident, the system is likely to be toppled.
ANIMAL FARM is my favorite treatment of regime propaganda and how its constant evolution and contradictions put even the mightiest at risk. Tech has created a great contradiction in that censorship simultaneously is easier broadly and more difficult narrowly. Twitter can suspend millions, and that‚Äôs a huge deal, but they do have places to go. Orwell would be in hog heaven (pun intended).

            It also makes regimes brittle. The Soviet Union was culturally spend by the time Brezhnev took power. He knew it and his circle knew it. The system was running on the inertia from Stalin. To keep in running meant sweeping away any obstacles. When they could not hide the truth of the Afghan debacle, the system started to crack and eventually shattered.

            While everyone favors executing journalists, they are like feathers in the wind. If the political winds change, they will be the great champions of whatever lies behind those winds. The Russians have a word that generally means ‚Äúthe intellect‚Äù. This is a person who posture as an intellectual, but only has a superficial understanding of things. They take positions not out of conviction or rationalist, but as a performance. These were people who cheered the communists, even though they would be dispatched by the communists.Our media selects for bourgeois poseurs. They now cheer for censorship, because that is the fashionable pose, even though it will mean the razor for their career eventually. They can change on a dime if that offers the chance to be the special snowflake. When the revolution comes, their opinions will be whatever they think is fashionable at that moment.

                Hmpppfffffff.Some maybe. The smaller, inconsequential ones perhaps. But Z, most of these guys are not all brainless, fickle poseurs just doing what they are told. Remember that goofy kid in the MAGA hat? The one that was an evil racist because he laughed at a native cretin that was beating the tom-tom? They ALL tried to kill him by labelling him a racist when he clearly was not. They tried to kill Rittenhouse the same way and meddle in the judicial process by spinning it as a race war issue.  They tried to dox the jurors and do the same to them. These acts are deliberate, focused, and premeditated. I am old enough to remember when real journalists would have found stuff like this deeply troubling and would have said so. When the winds of war blow against them they do not change their tune for fashion or appealing to new sensibilities, they do it to save their hides.These guys (and gals) are high value enemy combatants. Many of them deserve the death they intended for their victims. If opportunities permit, I‚Äôd suggest that the editors and publishers are also high value targets.Hypothetically speaking, of course.

            GlenIt sounds like you read ‚ÄúWhat I Saw at the Coup‚Äù by Matt Bracken.
In it, a lone gunman puts down a talking head at a ship christening ( I think it was the Harvey Milk).
Her head explodes on an Admirals nice white dress uniform. Being on live TV there was no way to censor it.
That got the ball rolling, and I‚Äôll let whoever wants to read it enjoy the ending.
It‚Äôs free online and a quick read.
That said, things were much worse in the story. We‚Äôre not quite there yet.

        A nice essay, putting me in the mind of the one Orwell wrote many years ago [1946 to be precise], titled, ‚ÄúPolitics and the English Language.‚Äù  He calls out five categories of linguistic sins, one of which, ‚Äúmeaningless words,‚Äù is especially pertinent.  Here‚Äôs a longish quote worth repeating:‚ÄúMany political words are similarly abused. The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‚Äòsomething not desirable‚Äô. The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of r√©gime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way.‚ÄùThe whole essay may be found here;https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/

        Couple observations:1. Though certainly reference to Syme in 1984 as being a clear tangent from this point, Orwell‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúPolitics and the English Language‚Äù is an excellent treatment of this subject.2. Lack of language is lack of thought.3. I open my web browser at work this morning, and I encounter on the news agglomeration splash page, via the NYTimes, that GenZ has coined a new word: ‚ÄúCheugy.‚Äù It traces the arc of the proliferation of a word created by a 20 something who said there was no word to describe a person or thing that was trendy but is now out of fashion and trying to hard, or just worn out reference. Besides categorizing it as a adjective, then one of the three definitions being a noun on the NYTimes tweet, the utter proliferation of babbling is insane. There are words for those concepts, e.g. outmoded, hackneyed, pass√©. Each of these three words are more specific and clear. But, of course, the point, much as in ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù and 1984, is that people have unclear thoughts, and the more all encompassing a word is, the more people remain in a fog and can easily be lead because they have no language except Orthodoxy.4. Thanks for the post. The dearth and death of language is one of my favorite topics.

                I hear ya! Though of course Orwell is no prophet, he sometimes pinned the problem like a lepidopterist with a butterfly. I don‚Äôt know if you have ever read a piece by CS Lewis, ‚ÄúWilling Slaves of the Welfare State,‚Äù but it is another one of those tracts that simply nails the modern condition. He makes many brilliant points in the essay, but my favorite is that, in the era of medical tyranny (I mean, dang, he is writing this in the 50s!), because the government views you as sick, they are treating the illness, not you. Thus, they can do any wickedness to you because any cruelty they inflict upon you is to ‚Äòcure‚Äô you. Man, the minds some people possess.

                    Fantastic essay.‚ÄúOn just the same ground I dread government in the name of science. That is how tyrannies come in. In every age the men who want us under their thumb, if they have any sense, will put forward the particular pretension which the hopes and fears of that age render most potent. They ‚Äòcash in‚Äô. It has been magic, it has been Christianity. Now it will certainly be science. Perhaps the real scientists may not think much of the tyrants‚Äô ‚Äòscience‚Äô‚Äì they didn‚Äôt think much of Hitler‚Äôs racial theories or Stalin‚Äôs biology. But they can be muzzled.‚ÄùHe had vision.
