        I cannot comment on what happens on the campus of any one US University, let alone on a specific place like University of Virginia. But I am qualified to speak about the news gathering and processing of information as I worked in the media for many years.The whole point of the media is to tell a story. It may or may not be entirely accurate, but the telling is the important aspect. As such, news comes in to the media office and has to be analysed (we called it being ‘tasted’ to see if if, I suppose, it was palatable for our readers) but we also knew that there had to be a number of background checks made on a news story.In many cases you couldn’t get the story exactly right (An aside: I was once berated at length by a couple who lived on the same street as a man who committed suicide and the newspaper had published in its report he was 63. This couple told me my paper was useless because they knew this unfortunate man was in fact 64 when he died) but there were some approaches you could take to determining if the story was reasonably correct at the time of going to press.There’s the kicker: at some point you have to publish and as such the news gatherers are pinned to print and/or distribution times.Sometimes the desire to examine a source might head in the wrong direction for too long. An example of this was when an editorial office I worked with had heard that a teenage schoolboy, on a visit to a zoo, had stuffed a baby penguin into his bag and smuggled it on to the school bus. Now this is one of those ‘urban myths’ that bounce around but in their eagerness for such a good story the editorial people got on it at once. They sat down and began phoning the city’s schools to check if there had been any party of school kids going to this particular zoo that day, and if so had any bulging, struggling bags been seen on buses.They spent a couple of hours drawing blanks on that, and abandoned the story as unlikely. It was only later that the editor wanted to know why his team hadn’t done the obvious thing and asked the zoo if one of their penguins was missing. The oh-so-eager journos could only hide their embarrassment by saying they thought ringing dozens of schools was the right way to verify the story.So, the point of this is that sometimes even experienced journalists don’t ask the obvious questions in the right way. The same may go for their editors, too.This doesn’t mean the UVA story is true (FWIW I think it is doubtful for a number of reasons) but journalists can sometimes chase the wrong cat up a distant tree.

        What a delicious rape fantasy. What a colossal example of penis envy, or should I say penis desire.
The tip-off here is the shards of glass tale. A tasty tidbit indeed, but completely false. Such a situation would cause profuse bleeding and require immediate emergency care.

        Not sure why you deny the UVA rapes. Frat boys are degenerates and peer pressure plus alcohol makes them worse. I don’t doubt the girl’s story is true and the journalist is said to have conducted significant background research.
