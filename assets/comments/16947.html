        “A revolution that seeks to preserve the past is not a revolution. It is a restoration.”The problem with the Bolsheviks is that they attempted to replace a thousand year history with something that had never existed anywhere on earth and never will. As Americans contemplate their own coming revolution, they should remember that there are parts of their history that are worth keeping and parts that are not. Nicholas was far more a son of Mother Russia than were Lenin and Stalin, and he tried (albeit unsuccessfully) to do the right thing for a nation he clearly loved. He and his family did not deserve to die at the hands of leftist barbarians as we do not deserve to die at the hands of ours. Lenin and Stalin and all the revolutionaries who followed and participated in the destruction, rape, and murder of Russia were the real strangers. And yes, the Hermitage is one of the most beautiful buildings that has ever existed in the world. Been there multiple times.

            This is the right wing in a nutshell. Too nostalgic to admit that calcified order cannot be sculpted around. Too enamored with aesthetics to see the impractical nature of the beutiful cage, even as the walls close in.

You make it sound as though it’s odd that both are true.

                    In America the requirements to being anti-Semitic are either general stupidity, or becoming unusually perspicacious.

                        Sometimes being a simple person allows you to both see and accept the obvious. Smart people are very good at convincing themselves to not believing their lying eyes.

                    There are some views that seem to characterize only the very stupid and the very smart. My guess is that dumb people make a few observations and quickly jump to an often radical general conclusion from them. Then, when told by “their betters” that this is wrong, they just stubbornly say “yeah but I noticed that people who drive blue cars are always tall so, nyah, nyah, you’re wrong!” (or whatever their poorly founded idea is). The intelligent will make lots of observations, do research, read about the subject, see a general pattern, and then refuse, out of justified confidence in their own observations, to accept what supposed authority figures say. Most people in the middle lack intellectual confidence even where a preponderance of evidence shows that something is true and lack the ability of the stupid to quickly make some (largely unfounded) conclusion based on a few observations. They know not to trust their own hasty reasoning but not how to determine when people who are usually right about things are lying to them.There’s a social mobility angle as well. The stupid may realize that the “better” people will never accept them anyway so why bother trying to butter them up by adopting their ideas? Smart people may feel that they can do just fine on their own and don’t need to pretend to believe popular nonsense. In the middle you’ve got those who still have some hope that being obsequious will help them move up – and now you’ve got your basic social media bullshitter and virtue signal whore!

        Z you need to remember that the reason that the Bolsheviks were so eager to kill the czar and destroy Russian culture is that they were not Russians. They hated Russians. The leadership and financiers was primarily chosen people. The others were mainly part of Russia’s very own Coalition of the Fringes. Stalin, for example, was Georgian.Now if I was a real thought criminal, I might draw parallels between what happened in Russia and what is happening in the US. Then I might use Russia to project what that will mean for heritage Americans in the future. But, I  am sure in our case that Diversity will be our greatest strength and the chosen will rule US compassionately and wisely

                Perhaps, but few were eager to end the Kerensky government. The Bolshies were less than 5% of the population.

                    They might not have been, but when the Kerensky government pledged to Britain and France to keep shedding muzhik blood in their millions by staying in their war, the army and the people did not care when the Bolsheviks deposed him.

                        True enough, for most. But if the Germans had won the war, which they almost did after Russia caved, they would most likely have changed their tune. The Brest-Litovsk Treaty makes Versailles look like mollycoddling.
(Which is something worth remembering when we discuss how the Germans were robbed by Versailles. Imperial Germany may not have been solely, or even preponderantly, responsible for starting the war, but they weren’t the good guys. Hitler didn’t just pull his plans for Poland and Ukraine out of his fundament.)

                            I’ve decided that it’s hugely important that groups have something in their history where they feel screwed over. I get Z-Man and others’ advice that we as a people should be defined by what we’re for, but nothing bonds people together like spite over a past injustice (real or imaginary).The Germans had Versailles. The fact that they did the same thing at Brest-Litovsk didn’t matter in their minds.One issue that non-Southern European Americans have is that no ever stomped our ass. Sure, we’ve lost a few wars – Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan – but it’s not like they invaded Cincinnati and pushed around our kids.We have no concept of being ruled over by those who despise and mistreat us. That will change.

                                You’re being ruled over by people who despise and mistreat you right now. (1). And Cincinnati /has/ been invaded, successfully, and more than once.  And right now, there /are/ hostile foreigners and invaders pushing around your kids in Cincinnati and places just like it.(1) — You may not think you are being “mistreated” at present, simply because you are not living in the gutter in filthy rags, (yet), but you are indeed being most heinously mistreated.  You don’t notice it yet because North America is such a large, rich place, and has not yet spent down all its reserves of social capital.  And as I believe Adam Smith observed, “there is a great deal of ruin in a nation”.  Think of what this nation would look like, what its natural logical condition would be in every respect, if it were not riddled with negroes, Jews, and hostile foreign invaders.You have been pillaged and looted and swindled.  Your children have been robbed blind, the entirety of their patrimony, their inheritance and their future stolen right out from under them.  You have foreign troops billeted upon you.You have been most gravely mistreated already.  Even though what’s coming will be far worse, don’t kid yourself that it hasn’t started yet.

                                    All true. But as you noted, most whites – certainly upper middle class and wealthy whites – haven’t felt the pain and can’t see what their world would have been like if we weren’t ruled by another tribe and invaded.And, yes, it’s going to get worse. In time, a POC-dominated government will steal our money, force us to live next door to the blacks and browns and encourage violence against us, all the while forcing us to grovel and apologize for our privilege.American whites will learn what it’s like to be Helots. We’ll have our story of bondage that hopefully will inspire the hate that binds groups together.

                                    The problem I think most people have – is that they’re not able to take a hard look at their life and see where they’re being stolen from.When confronted by the argument that they’re being methodically pillaged – in my experience they just fall back on Stockholm-Syndrome excuses like:“if we didn’t pay taxes we wouldn’t have roads and schools”” The US needs to support Israel because it’s a democracy”” we need to spend more money on black children in school so they can learn better”” we can’t cut the military otherwise the ISIS blue-water navy will be threatening our eastern seaboard”“If the US doesn’t act as the world’s policeman – we’ll have chaos”etc. etc and etc.I know a lot of friends who have children that are just coming out of college.  One of the WTF moments they’re now getting to experience – is the thrill of working their asses off all week – and then seeing in plain numbers how much of that hard work disappears off to taxation.Unfortunately it seems most people get stupified over the years – and completely forget about this eye opening experience.  I also believe that office “work” dis-associates people from the mindset of watching how they’re getting robbed.  If  you’re a coal miner and your pay depends on how hard you work your muscles each every day – well then you understand that your well being is just one mis-step away from going away permanently.  You therefore understand on a more visceral basis when you’re being stolen from.  I can tell you that I was much more pissed off about being stolen from – when I had to make a living thru working my body hard every day – than when I started making a living by working a keyboard in a cubicle.

                            You don’t understand.  The enemy is 5 percent of Whites, viz. violent leftist psychopath Whites, plus ALL of the Chosenites, and ALL of the POCs.Pretty big number.  Plus, on top of having White psychopaths and highly motivated black shock troops and ooking bands of chaotic rape-apes, the Chosenites and their ching-chong and pajeet flunkies control ALL of the choke points and bottlenecks, plus the Left is, generally speaking, much more tech-savvy.  Oh, and plus the youth advantage skews their way.  The blind-hatred advantage, too.It’s quite a sobering thing to contemplate.  When I see how naive so many of these blustering DOTR types are, it really gives one pause.

                                True. But we have two very important – quite possibly decisive – things on our side:
1. We’re one tribe. They are a fractious bunch who generally hate each other slightly less than they hate us.
2. They’re simply wrong. They will run this ship into the ground sooner or later. The more apparent that becomes, the weaker their grip on power.

                                It’s actually worse in America. The thing to understand about America is that every once and a while, but consistently, New Englanders lose their fucking minds in a religious spasm. It’s the puritans mostly. Abolition was a result of this and the Great Awakening. Prohibition was religiously motivated. It gets trickier in the 1960s, given that many puritan congregations lost their religion at the time. The general shape is there though. As there is in today’s social justice spasm. Vox recently showed that white liberals are to the left of blacks on social justice and to the left of Hispanics and asians on immigration.This is why the “What is White culture?” is such a virulent meme. There is a large class of whites in the Northeast and West Coast plus diaspora in small pockets around the country, who are religiously liberal and fanatical about it.

                The best thing about Twitter is it allows the mask to drop and provides a glimpse of the hatred the chosen have for the goys. The Covington hoax alone should terrify Whites when they see that prominent media members of the tribe and their syncophants wanted to destroy the lives of kids over a smile. Sad but whites can’t connect those dots yet.

        Wonderful travelog, Z, ‘Road to Oxania’-level stuff.But rather important to your telling of the Lenin-slaughter narrative is the presence, on the sealed car with Lenin, of millions in gold bullion, put there by Jacob Schiff and other Wall Street proto-globohomo schemers, who were intent on overthrowing the Czar not because they were appalled by the ostentation of the ruling family but because hey, no Rothschild central bank. The Czars, like Andrew Jackson, had “thrown the rascals out.”  And guess what?  After the “revolution,” priority no. 1, in addition to seizing control of the apparatus of government, was the creation of a Central Bank.Because what’s a people’s revolution without a foreign-backed, privately-held central bank?So one predator group was replaced by a more ruthless predator group.  The revolution will be privatized.  At least the Czars were nominal Christians, which counts for more than you may realize.  That jewel of a Church you visited, as well as the thousands of churches the communists destroyed?  Those churches were and are the very skeleton of the culture, the visible manifestation of a people’s inclination toward Godliness. They were the bulwark against exactly proceeded to take place in Soviet Russia — the slaughter of millions of people by ideologues intent on “remaking society.” Thankfully, after 70 years, the communist attempt at destroying the church and of shattering traditional society failed in the East.But now we witness this same hideous anti-Culture resurfaced in the newly-invertebrate West, financed by the same eternal predatory Superforce, as always a heartless revenant thirsting for blood.This is not revolution, Z.  It is premeditated murder.

        All happy countries are alike, each unhappy country is unhappy in its own way.
We’re ruled by jumped up white trash, malicious parasites,avaricious money grubbing immigrants and retards.
We don’t need a revolution, we need a fumigation.
If we allow things to continue on like this, let things rot to the point where no one cares anymore, then good riddance.

            Fumigation might kill all of the rats , but it’s not going to repair all of the holes they chewed thru the structure of the nation.
Fixing that is going to require something more than just fumigation.  Especially because even if you kill off all the rats – most of the people who are left will get pissed off about you attempting to fix the holes.
They’ll argue that they’ve always been there,  they let in the light,  they’re good ventilation – whatever.
You can’t stop with just fumigation.  It needs to go further than that.

        A long time family friend visited St. Petersburg in the 1990s, not terribly long after the end of the Cold War. At the time, he was in his mid to late 60s. He talked about the Winter Palace and how strange it seemed. Large simply for the sake of being large, or as he put it, “we walked a lot to get anywhere.”Around the same time I had toured Italy and Greece. Something that stood out to me when touring St. Peter’s Basilica was that I had seen Southern Baptist churches with more square footage. Even the Square seemed barely adequate for a decent little league game. This may have been an artifact of the crowds or the enclosing architecture, but nevertheless, the seat of the Holy Roman Catholic Church seemed almost cozy.Greece was different in very similar ways. There were many large things, but the large things were all experienced close up and personal. If you presented the Parthenon to a successful dentist from Dubuque, he’d want to know where he’s supposed to put his wine cellar.I wonder if all of these differences are expressed as differences of national character based on expectations. A European can drive for 1000km and find himself unable to speak the language. In America, we can drive in any random direction for 1000km and still find a decent BBQ joint and probably a rave. A Russian can drive 10,000 km east and still order in Russian.

        If you haven’t seen it already, you very much need to check out the film “Russian Ark”.  Shot entirely inside the Hermitage, it’s a theatrical-style re-enactment of all of Russian history up to 1917.  It is also shot in a single, continuous tracking shot with no cuts or edits, meaning the entire film is performed “live” from beginning to end.  It is the longest single tracking shot in motion picture history.
Really quite a marvel to behold.  I’m sure some enterprising Bakkaball-Americans will cook up something similar any day now.

        There is a whiff of revolution in the air. I smell it on myself sometimes.
The question is whether it ends in a bang or a whimper.
I worry about the latter, being just a middle-aged working stiff with zero IRL d-right contacts. Not even my family knows.
I worry too many of our guys are in the same boat.
I donate money, and I’ve written for some d-right publications under a different pseudonym, but is it enough?

        The biggest problem with revolutions is that once they get rolling, they’re very hard to stop before everyone is murdered or starves to death. The American colonies were lucky to be up against a strong king, which forced us to unite under a strong leader of our own, who then had the authority to say, “The Revolution is over, we won!”No such character emerged in the French Revolution until Napoleon. Lenin might have tired of Bolshevik atrocities and put a stop to them, had he not been crippled by an assassin’s bullet. Instead, it took Stalin’s purges to finally end the Russian Revolution. (Or betray it, if you’re a Trotskyite who believes in endless revolution)

            The Terror of 1793-4 was the highlight, not the low, to most dedicated lefties. It is their sine qua non of revolution, and what they would like to see go on and on in whatever revolution they are running. I think this comes from a deep down realization that they have no real vision of a civilization or culture that they want to build, and that any talk about one is but a mere pretext for the destruction they actually desire. The true revolutionary is nothing but a nihilist driven by hatreds. Look at the key players in the national, constituent, and convention assemblies and the powers in the background and this is mostly what you see. The people who are interested in building something are all shoved to the side.Auden once wrote that the problem with revolutionaries is that they love experimentation but can never seem to get past the destructive phase.

It was all the rage when I was at uni, a 700-page monster describing how the global masses – the “multitudes”, as Negri and Hart labelled them – would rise up, overflow all borders and tear down the existing order.So what happens next? Triumphant, the ‘multitudes’ will demand justice. Never mind that these gentlemen didn’t bother to define “justice”, but who the fuck are they making demands of? They’re standing on the rubble heap of the old order, and now they implore the old order to make sure they get restitution? I thought the old guard were all hanging form lampposts?It is THAT infantile. Like a teenager, entirely dependent on his parents, who demands a greater allowance or he’ll… he’ll…. Dammit! Just give me more money, you fascist old bastards!

                    The American Revolution really should be labeled the American Coup. American elites wanted total control, to be the end of the line instead of having to report to Britain. They had no intention of overturning the existing order. They just wanted to boss.

                Note the veneration over 1793, 1848, and 1968.  1989 is airbrushed away.  It is a peculiar fetishizing of the awful and the profane.

                    The Communists, and the (((communists))), were never made to pay a price after they were defeated in 1989.  This was a grave mistake.  The Russian people were instead punished by being looted, while the real perpetrators got off scot-free — and even got rich off of the second looting of Russia.  The enemy just scuttled off to a new hideout, and began their evil all over again — which is now at the very perch of final success.Following the victories in 1945, the German and Japanese ultranationalists were severely punished, and their ideology was utterly, deliberately and meticulously discredited.  The (((communists))) after their defeat were given tenure and $$$.

            The American revolution wasn’t really much of a revolution, in the same sense that the French or Russian revolutions were. Those revolutions were all about great reorderings of the societies that spawned them.
The American revolution was simpler. The colonists simply wanted to continue doing what they were already doing, without having King George’s nose in their business. It was more of a change of management than a revolution.

                There were some Trotskyites agitating for such a great reordering — John Adams mentions this in a letter to his wife — but the Founding Fathers held firm, put away the Declaration of Independence, and wrote a Constitution that said nothing about human equality.

        “That’s the thing about Russian women. Father time is never very kind to them…”The same can be said about Hungarian women. In some Eastern Asian countries, I am used to seeing attractive women into their 50’s and, occasionally, 60’s. In Budapest, many of the young women are astonishingly sexy but not trampy. Then comes the 30’s and it just disappears.It is rare to see a woman in Budapest over 40 who doesn’t look like she could be an extra in a film about the USSR. When you go into stores, one of the first things you notice is that the older women look like they have often contemplated suicide and the only thing that keeps them going in the chance to take out their misery on the customers.

            All this may be true.  Though as a kid, in the 70s, just about the only images of Russian women anyone ever saw were babushkas.  Like they came that way from the factory.  Female Olympians with 5 o’clock shadow didn’t help matters.

Reminds me of something Bill Bryson wrote about country girls in his home state of Iowa. He said that they were often quite pretty as young women, but that they were like those blow-up rafts. When they hit around 30, it’s like someone pulls their cord, and they dramatically expand.

                Eastern Asian middle class and affluent women pretty much view taking care of their skin as a part time job. In this part of Asia, skin care clinics are almost as prevalent as 711’s.
Unfortunately, now in the US all a woman has to be is just overweight and slovenly but not obese and she will have men sworming her online.

        That’s how it is with revolutions. The people in charge, at some point, take a turn where they no longer see themselves as an extension of the people over whom they rule. They begin to see themselves as different and separate. They start to turn the rituals and ceremonies of the people’s shared reality into a psychological barrier, reminding the people on the other side that they are not inside. That’s when they start building walls and exclusive retreats.
Hmmm. That doesn’t sound familiar at all….

        Any journey can seem like an adventure if you open your eyes and dare to engage with the locals. Good on you for sharing this with us.As to the revolutionary insight, a mature and affluent society always rots from the top down. The people in charge (elites in the new vernacular) eventually become inept and remote because all the hardship gauntlets that produce leadership skill have been systematically eliminated in their sheltered lives. The people at the bottom are always struggling and will naturally revolt when the idiocracy becomes overwhelming. In the USA, we are now accelerating into maximum idiocracy.

        “There can be no empathy, though, as when the revolution comes, the people on either side of those walls no longer know one another as people. You cannot have empathy for strangers who hold you in contempt.”
I have really been enjoying this series for the cultural observations.  This particular quote hit me like a hammer after reading yesterday about the gentleman wearing a MAGA hat at Starbucks.  We’ve reached the point of contempt and there is no going back.

        I recall watching a documentary a few years back about the history of Russia. St. Petersburg was the project launched by Peter the Great after he toured Western Europe and felt chagrined by the fact that Russia had no grand cities like London, Paris or Vienna. Apparently, the land upon which St. Petersburg is built was marshland which had to be drained before a brick could be laid. According to a Russian historian they interviewed, more Russians died in the building of St. Petersburg than in all their wars combined.

        South African Supermodels seem to be the way to go. I do have a soft spot for Anna Kournicova and Maria Sharapova. It goes along with my belief that every free white man should own a couple of Supermodels if possible. Tube travel in London was enjoyable to me for some reason. The New York subway in my experience was a shithole. The Rocky Mountaineer looks good for recreational train travel. Did I mention Olga Kurylenko? She is Ukrainian-French. She is also on my list.

        The best seat, at least in German trains (ICE) is in the dining car. You can often grab a 2-person table next to the window and have it to yourself for the duration of your trip.When I have a 6-hour train ride, I head straight to the dining car, sit myself down, set up my laptop, put my headphones on and stay there until I get off the train. It might cost me a couple of beers, but the dining staff has never asked me to leave. I honestly think they’re happy to have me because I’m one less table they have to worry about.For the price of 2nd class, it’s the best way to go!

        Did you happen to notice any bizarre architectural features? For example, many buildings have a small set of stairs leading up to the front door. But below what you assume is the first floor is the actual first floor, often half buried in the ground. You might say, well that’s just a basement level. But many have bricked up windows, also half buried in the ground. This feature is common throughout the city.Now, keeping the above in mind consider that Saint Petersburg was said to have been designed and built by Peter the Great. I was able to find many of the “blueprints” of those designs. Oddly, the “new” buildings largely featured a floor half buried with stairs leading up to the next floor. And many appeared to have bricked up windows by design, only half of which was above ground. A reasonable conclusion can be made that these buildings were reconstructions. I can find no references to what the buildings were originally. So my question is, what caused the ground level to rise between 5 and 10 feet?Another thing that puzzles me is that the incredible statuary and other focal features at the palaces in Saint Petersburg seem to be missing their original placards. It’s often easy to see with the naked eye. New placards were put in their place. I know a Russian speaking person who claims they can’t find any living descendants of the palace builders. Not being Russian speaking, I wouldn’t bother to look too deeply into this myself.All of this gives me the feeling that the history of Saint Petersburg has been largely whitewashed.

It is more likely that the buildings have sunk. Saint Petersburg was built on marshland.

            Built on marshy loose unconsolidated soil, a similar building phenomena affects San Francisco Mission district…sinking buildings a half story below ground. The 1906 earthquake caused liquefaction, which is:“Loose sand and silt that is saturated with water can behave like a liquid when shaken by an earthquake.  Earthquake waves cause water pressures to increase in the sediment and the sand grains to lose contact with each other, leading the sediment to lose strength and behave like a liquid. The soil can loose its ability to support structures, flow down even very gentle slopes, and erupt to the ground surface to form sand boils. Many of these phenomena are accompanied by settlement of the ground surface — usually in uneven patterns that damage buildings, roads and pipelines.”Man, you should have seen the damage due to liquefaction by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The whole Cypress elevated freeway structure collapsed, the Marina District suffered mass destruction and was partially build from landfill that was ironically the debris from the 1906 earthquake, and multiple sand boils from Santa Cruz to Oakland.

        I have always been interested in traveling to the Taiga in Russia (the worlds largest coniferous forest). I have no idea what I’d do there, and it’s probably best that it remains an interest only. Sometimes you just know that your imagination is going to outstrip reality.

                The documentary is definitely required viewing.  The police are even telling residents there is nothing they can do – because the city council is holding them back.Sounds like the same thing is going on in Portland:https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/04/portland-crisis-with-120-vacancies-only-3-out-of-60-applicants-pass-police-background-check/Last month TGP reported that internal politics and a pro-antifa attitude inside the Portland Police Bureau leadership and city hall has led to an exodus of officers leaving the bureau, either retiring early or going to work for other agencies in the area. With 120 job openings, reports are now coming out that would-be new hires are failing pass the introductory background check. Bigly.Have to read the whole thing.  Surrounding communities are pulling back help for mutual aid.  The lefties are collapsing the city.This will be fun to watch.

            Lived in Philadelphia when crack hit town and though  in a “nice” area it was within scavenging range of the crackheads.  Similar to the heroin addicts they would steal and sell anything, like leaf cutter ants stripping the forest.  You’d leave the broken vent window with cardboard in it so the next guy could get in your car to find there was nothing and they’d break the window anyway.  And.  It.  Never.  Stopped.  I understand how worn down these people are.

        It wasn’t just the politics of the time that failed.  The Russian Orthodox Church became a mere fixture and prostitute of the Czarist state.  Instead of a focus on Christ it became a mere instrument of the state apparatus (much the way Putin is making it today).As a matter of fact you can say that most religious denominations are wholly owned by state subsidies.  Look at all the billions of dollars going to various denominations to feed, clothe and house new immigrants.  The Pope himself is a spokesman for such lawless flooding of these people.Just as the people violently turned away from religion in 1917, they will also turn away from the modern day Christianity until it reforms itself to be above and away from being a prostitute of the state.  This means that most denominations won’t make it  Nor should they.  It takes generations to repair bonds like that.

        Sounds like the place hasn’t changed much since I was there about 15 years ago.  Dangerous city to walk around drunk — could easily get run over by the crazy drivers.  Observation about the women is spot-on.
I know some on the right really like Putin, and he has done some good things — for instance, much higher fraction of babies are born healthy now — but Russia is still a petro state.  They don’t produce anything.  Russians are smart and all that talent is being squandered.
It’s also obvious that Russia much lower social trust than other European countries.

            “Russians are smart and all that talent is being squandered”All the smart ones have already moved down here to Brooklyn.The continuing brain drain will drive the final nail in the coffin.It’s a shame because they have so much potential, but 100 years of The Boot on Their Neck Forever has damaged the country beyond repair.Nonetheless I wish them best of luck; I hope that the US could eventually come around the being an ally  of theirs, while simultaneously shunning China.

                Breaking news: Russia is on the ascent; the U.S. is on the descent. If they have any sense, all those brainy Russian-Americans will move back to Russia where they’ll have a future, away from the giant slum known as the once-great USA.

                Observing national IQ maps one day I saw some small east European countries, plus the Ukraine, had surprisingly low scores. Then I realized the smart fractions had been the first to move to where they might advance.

                    The smart fractions of places like Poland, Hungary and Ukraine were mass-murdered by the (((communists))) a couple of generations ago.  Presumably they haven’t yet recovered from the loss of their core natural aristocracy and brain trust.  Why do you think (((communist))) architecture in those countries was so breathtakingly ugly and suffocating?  Same thing with the art.  It was a deliberate attempt to deprive White Christians of their history, culture, and pride.  That sort of thing has a profound dulling effect on the mind.I’m fairly certain you’re going to see plummeting White IQ scores in the near future right here at home, as White children are increasingly demonized, deliberately miseducated, demoralized, hypnotized, drugged, brainwashed, poisoned, conditioned, de-cultured, deracinated, exposed to and mixed with numerous assorted flavors of rape-ape.Hey man, whatever’s good for the Jews, right?

                Most  of the Russians in Brooklyn or anywhere else in America are actually (((Russians))).  The young and ambitious Russians don’t come to America – they go to London or Paris.
