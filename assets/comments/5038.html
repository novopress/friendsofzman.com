        I had this DR discussion online with Pete Abraham of the Boston Glob in a comments section three years ago. In Boston they (finally) abhor Manny Ramirez for his despicable behavior and three failed PED tests, hope that David Ortiz was clean in spite of the evidence, and worship Pedro Martinez, who could do no wrong. Pedro was roiding before either of them. I stated that at the turn of the century there was not a single Dominican who was not roiding, that as backward as the Dominican is, state of the art clinics operate there–beyond the reach of American law. That is a good thing. But the Dominican players had benefit of the best programs. Problems only developed for them when testing came into being, the type of test which any track and field athlete or bicyclist would be expected to beat  order to compete, but which will over time present problems for users high in impulsivity and low in IQ, describing Dominican baseball players in general. In fact, the great majority of baseball players getting busted over the last few years are Dominican.  Pedro is an outlier, highly intelligent and intuitive.No one of course appreciated my contribution. but Abraham, to his credit, thought them to be “racialist” rather than racist. The war on noticing.I’ve an acquaintance, an uber liberal-fascist who made the mistake of asking me why the DR was not the hell hole Haiti is while sharing the same island.  I explained to him that in the revolution of 1806 the slaves murdered all the whites, but more significantly, all the mulattoes; that Caribbean islands of that type are all run by mulattoes, of which the DR has none, condemning it to being Haiti in perpetuity. I could see that he immediately understood, but he could not acknowledge that verbally.

            James- Spot on on the first part of your post- as for the second I’m not sure I follow you- is or is not the DR the hellhole Haiti is? My sense, not having been to either nor wishing to live in either is that the DR is better. Or maybe I’m just thick!

                Pretty thorough comparison of DR to Haiti:http://www.indexmundi.com/factbook/compare/haiti.dominican-republic
The DR is pretty much Puerto Rico without the warping effect of US colonial rule. Haiti is what you would expect if Detroit was a country in a warm climate.

        The naming and shaming is one thing.  The state controlling so much of individual revenue is another.  By the time of the Brezhnev years, the USSR didn’t need a lot of gulags.  It could achieve the same effects by controlling employment, pension, authorized residence areas, etc.  Waiting to see when the first laws are passed to dock SS, Medicare, and one-hundred plus other “entitlements” in response to some heterodox opinion or another.

        It’s not just the stultifying PC on ESPN- it’s the way they cover things- their coverage of the British Open was appalling!

        The bad news is every cable subscriber contributes $7 to ESPN every month. The good news is the number of cable subscribers appears to have peaked a few years ago.

            The American TV oligopoly is in many ways a Ponzi scheme. When cable was rolling out 25 years ago, there were always new homes to add to the system. Broadband was what drove a lot of the expansion.  I know I got cable TV when I wanted to upgrade by DSL to something faster. That was in the 90’s. The offer at the time was cable TV $30 per month and broadband internet for an extra $5 month.  Imagine that!With revenues going up every quarter, it only made sense for the cable companies to keep adding channels. Much of was funded with borrowed money at artificially low rates. Municipalities were offering all sorts of tax breaks and incentives to goose the rollout of cable. In Virginia, the state essentially paid for the infrastructure through tax deals.The trouble is the number of new customers began to decline so rates had to rise in order to make the math work. That’s what undoes every Ponzi scheme. Instead of reducing returns to existing investors like a Ponzi scheme, cable rates have shot up.  That’s what leads to a rush for the exits. In the case of video content, delivering it over the internet offers a low cost alternative to the cable scheme.I’m fond of saying that reality is the thing that does not go away when you stop believing in it. The fact is each household has a maximum of forty hours of TV time per week. The average home watched 35 hours per week. That’s one reality. Forcing people to buy even 10x that as part of the TV package is at war with reality. People will find a way around it in time. The music business discovered this with their bundled service (albums).The reality for TV is people are willing to pay for shows and events like sports on a pay-per-view model. They are unwilling to pay for content they are unlikely to watch. That’s why the ad-based system worked for so long. If you got an audience, you got advertisers. Something similar will be the norm once again, probably through platforms like Apple, Google, NetFlix and Amazon. ESPN will go back to having a few shows they sell on-line.
