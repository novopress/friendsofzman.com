        […] If you only read American media, you would never know that most of Europe is boiling with anti-immigration sentiment.  […]

        No no, you see, THAT’S what the current chief “executive” has in mind with “normalizing” relations with the communist/Socialist/ Fascist island off the Florida coast.To EXPORT folks of such “political” ilk TO there, not provide a closer stepping stone for such “new world order” operatives and dupes to just “pop over” to the US and “support” those “domestic” folk who have repeatedly proven themselves to be easily led in violent …uh…protest…for the sole purpose ofjustification of Communism, Socialism, and Fascism.You know…just “a little bit”.

        I hope that the unrest in Europe continues. It shows that there are still sentient beings there instead of the zombies that the Eurozone created. These are everyday Germans, not extremists. I’ve listened to some of the speeches their organizers have given at some of the rallies. There was nothing even remotely racist or extremist in anything they said. They even went out of their way to tell the crowd that they must be on their best behavior so as not to give the authorities reason to shut them down.I disagree that we are moving away from small groups to larger entities. That has been the case over the past 100 years up until the breakup of the Soviet Union. Things around the world have been devolving and reorganizing into smaller entities since then, for the most part. As you’ve pointed out, people don’t necessarily want to live with people unlike themselves. And certainly not through force. This will eventually happen here too. The divisions in the country, along so many different fault lines, are making themselves known in a big way and will continue to deepen. At some point I can see the country breaking apart, but just how this will happen remains to be seen.

        “What’s hilarious about hearing old lefties talk about “hooligans” disrupting the peace with their protests is it was not that long ago when these same lefties were the ones in the streets being called hooligans.”And the Left will happily throw the engine into reverse gear when necessary.  Only weeks ago, we were told that the looting and burning in Ferguson was the work of “outsiders”, not the noble, put-upon citizens of that victimized town.  The Left hurried to assure us that the *real* protestors were peaceful and thoughtful, despite their suffering, lest we think that a “handful” of alien troublemakers might taint their righteous cause.  (No chance of THAT, though – as you say, the Left sees right through the deception!)  So when the cause is of the Right, the presence of distasteful elements proves the whole business is rotten.  When the cause is of the Left, the troublemakers are just the insignificant exception to the 99% pure truth.

        You seemed to have touched on why “leaders” of sovereign nations seem so driven to allow immigrants of all stripes onto their soil.  It is the vision of one world government and the destruction of nationalism that is the first step in getting the populace to allow “foreigners” to rule and exploit them.  The one worlders worship power/money much more than national origin.  Of course in our own country our “leader” was brought up to despise the white culture of our country and seeks through unlimited immigration and “social justice” to water down our “whiteness”, consistent with one worldism.  Or am I just ranting?
