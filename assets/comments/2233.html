        I don’t think you are dividing the country correctly.  Upstate New York has a bunch of gun owners, as does rural Penn.I my opinion the “separation” is more city people who are use to having things “done” for them (cabs to work, no lawns to mow, ect.) and rural United States.  There are less of us so the voting goes the way of city but that does not mean we are in agreement.

        &lt;&gt;As I alluded to in my earlier post. I have never found a Liberal that would agree to secession. They require require a group to hate, exploit and punish. Maybe you have contrary experiences. Also you have more exposure than I do.

        Before the war of secession in 1860 it was actually talked about for the entire preceding decade.  Events always follow the talk, not the other way around, so going by the talk of the last few years, one might estimate we have only a little time before we know what the catalyst will be.  In 1860, it was a Presidential election during a time when Congress was already dueling with one another and coming to blows on the floor of the House.

        There are several different geographical ways in which the country could “split”, based on particular ideologies: coastal elites v. heartland conservatives; urban progressives v. rural conservatives; northern elites v. southern conservatives, etc….In fact, California now has a ballot initiative that has enough signatures to be placed on the 2016 ballot calling for splitting the state into 6 smaller states. Again, the boundaries are largely based on geography/ideology. We ARE segregating into different enclaves, and is that really such a bad thing? Let the “BLUE” folks drown in their own incompetent follies (cf. Detroit) and let the rest of us get on with our lives with minimal interference from those who think they are better than us.

        Catalyst will likely be a moderate to severe change in the level of comfort and hardship we endure. As long as we have beer, strippers, sports etc. prob nothing nothing will happen. Door to Door gun confiscation might also trigger it

            I agree, boone. History shows that revolutions usually start on an empty stomach. But, history is also full of surprises. The Scots, for no reason other than they feel like it, are about to divorce the Brits. I would not be shocked if one day the lunatics are the ones demanding a split, which they would get if they ask for it.

        Well, we’ve been in a Cold Civil War for a while now.  A hot one will be what precedes or proceeds any sort of secession.
The real question is what will be the catalyst?

        Secession is the only real answer.  However, Boonewaxwell is probably correct.  The Left will never let us go peacefully.  Perhaps they think they can use their new Mexican army against us.

        Do you think obama could call for troops and get enough to do the job, if the South should secede again?
I know he likes to (favorably) compare himself to Lincoln, but, he ain’t.

        Great Blog Zman. I completely sympathize with the withdraw and separate sentiment. But I have never found a leftist/liberal that would be willing to allow a peaceful departure. I see it as a major difference in mindset/perception. maybe there is an introvert/extrovert element to the  difference.
