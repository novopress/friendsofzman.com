        Yeah, I remember that crazy old coot drew out maps of the middle east on his chalkboards, and made wacky claims about an “impending disaster” in the mid east that would inevitably rear it’s ugly head in the US….Then he’d blather on about censorship in schools and “social media” sites…Oh, wait….Anyway, it took a rotating five person cast, modeled after a “The View” like “chat” format, to replace his coveted, lucrative, highly rated (by viewer numbers anyway)show….Now, I’ve warned folks they can call/drop by anytime, EXCEPT during Jeopardy of course.I’ve had folks tell me “Don’t bother calling between 5:00 and 6:00- Beck’s on!”Takes all kinds I suppose.

        Beck wears frames without any lenses in them, which I found odd in man who claims he’s going blind.
He earned ire from scores of conservative bloggers when had used used their scoops and discoveries on his tv show, without ever crediting them. I recall him stiffing Weasel Zippers &amp; Iowntheworld on few occasions.

        Both Beck and O’Reilly let you know they are in possession of knowledge and understanding that you could not possibly grasp, but it falls to them to suffer this duty of educating us nonetheless. O’Really, however, doesn’t mistake eczema for stigmata.
Beck’s long story about his night at the opera with his daughter is the funniest thing I’d heard in twenty years. But the years of self-importance have worn him down.

        Z – you are exactly right.  Every so often he comes up with something like this to re-affirm his “strength” and God’s hand helping him, etc.  Show-biz right from the preachers of old.
