        Only slightly less crazy and race-obsessed than Louis Farrakhan, who accuses people of the pale persuasion of having invented Ebola to kill off black Africans.  Note that Robin Wright’s loopy opinion piece was prefaced by a disclaimer from CNN that “the views expressed are her own.” Sure, who in their right mind would want to be associated with such crackpot ideas, putting them out there in public, in writing no less, where everyone can see how idiotic you are?  Apparently, not even CNN.

        American taxpayers will be stuck with a half million dollars in medical bills and another hundred thousand in clean up. He came to this country and exposed her family to Ebola and all she can do is criticize his medical treatment?
