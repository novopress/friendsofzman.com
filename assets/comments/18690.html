        Z mentions that conservative whites love having blacks (and, to a lessor degree, Hispanics) around to provide them with affirmation. If it hasn’t been coined yet, I’d like to take credit for the word “afro-mation.”
afro-mationnoun
The proving that a conservative white isn’t a racist and that POC deep down are natural conservatives

            Deep down all that white normies want is to see black people act white. And Blacks hate them for it.

                    You’re a radical bile.
Normie Whites tend to  like Sheriff Clarke ,Neil Degrasse Tyson and Morgan Freeman on those grounds  and assume the less talented 80% can be the same if they just try.
Alas its biological and they cannot . A complex high tech society has no use for people with weak impulse control , poor forward thinking and low IQ;’s of whatever race
An agrarian society can manage them and if they are strong and healthy, they have value.
These days, men barely have value, much less folks ill suited to high tech life.

                Exactly. Both white liberal and CivNats believe that POC are whites-in-waiting. They just need the right guidance to become whites in darkface. The hubris of these whites is stunning.
What’s more, they’re going to find out soon enough how very, very wrong they are.

        This is somewhat off-topic, but a thought occurred to me this week:
Is today for Hispanics what the 1950’s were for Whites?  In other words, is it a great time to be alive that will eventually be looked back upon wistfully?
They’re out of their sh***oles and the whole of society is set up to serve them.  Sounds like it’s a great time to be brown.

            Considering where they came from, non-smart-fraction Mexicans et al are getting an even bigger boost than Boomer Whites did.On the lower socioeconomic end, I’ve joked that poorer Whites, fixed income vets etc… would be better off burning their birth certs &amp; coming back in as illegals. Call up your local Catholic or Baptist charity and throw down some Spanglish about muh oppression &amp; you’ll get set up with an apartment and enough grub to last until Uncle Sucre’s sweet checks start arriving, courtesy of ACORN-level paperwork fraud provided by social workers employed by Pope Francis &amp; Russell Moore.I’m writing a book (dark humor, not serious politics) on it.Tejanos and other heritage Browns who were already middle class not so much, with the benefits coming mainly from affirmative action. Smart fractions would likely have risen to middle-class lifestyles wherever they were unless you’re talking Chiapas-level sh*tholes.

            I wasn’t around then but one massive difference between the 50s  and “the current year” is AA and the welfare state.   If Steve Camarota’s numbers are correct, and &gt; 70% of immigrants from Mexico and Central America are welfare dependent (80% for the DR,)  then you’d think they wouldn’t be so eager for whitey to become a minority.   Because then the Gravy Train stops.  And it’s doubtful that Asians will be eager to pick up the slack.   Interesting times.

                Problem is that with low intellect folk, the aspect of foresight is lacking as well as IQ.  They live in the present and handle tomorrow when it gets here.  Most of your recent “migrants” are in this camp.  But they are not alone, a good deal of poor Whites and second and third generation minorities are this way as well. Yes, one day the gravy train will stop and then there will be riots and civil unrest.  No way around it as long as our political leadership refuses to recognize HBD science.

        Have to chuckle at the political talking heads constant references to “the Hispanics”.  As though this is some monolithic group.  Grew up in S. Florida right after the first Cuban refugees got here.   Tracing out the various varieties (and accompanying beefs) among different Hispanic populations makes the family tree of Protestantism look simpleBut there is a world of difference between Hispanics that came from countries with developed middle classes—Cuba (which pre-revolution had the largest), Colombia and Chile and the Bolivians, Guatemalans and denizens of southern states in Mexico .  Very different people.  Recall how  the previously resident Puerto Rican’s hated the Cubans for stealing their cheese, the Cubans thought Dominicans and Venezuelans were the “Beverly Hillbillies”. The original Cubans were the ones warning the Marielitas were “muy mal hombres” and everybody despised the Mexicans.

        “…so you have to find ways to lift the spirits.”  Z-man – you’re obviously a smart fellow with an immense gift.  I can only imagine that you’re good at whatever it is you do for a living.  Have you considered breaking free – going solo – or even moving?I read the urban experiences here and shudder at “the tax” I endured for too long.  The key, I’ve learned, isn’t to find ways to lift the spirits (sometimes beer just isn’t enough) but instead to find ways to live that don’t squash the spirit in the first place.Hold fast my friend.  There’s an 80-acre farm next to me for sale.

        The refusal of American government to honor the Second Amendment is a confession that they lack the consent of the governed. I used to be a “don’t go there” guy on defending the 2A on the basis of resisting government, considering it to be Ruby Ridge fuel. But that’s what it stands for, on the shoulders of a prior century of English law expressly enacted to prevent a repeat of their prior disarmament by a crappy king.We were intended to have whatever armament necessary to make mass oppression a net negative for government.  Contra Robert Francis Cornholio, that means an AR-15.  To steal a bit from one of the TRS guys, I’m willing to top-out at one crew-served weapon per crew-sized household, but that’s due to practicality, not legality.

            Exactly right.  Resistance on the Ruby Ridge model is a literal dead end.  And I agree, I think our 2A right was intended to include any/all weapon that could be wielded (including support/maintenance) by the individual.  Machine gun – check.  Bazooka – check.  This particular right has been frittered away since the 1934 NFA.  Most people don’t know that WW1 vets brought their full-auto machine guns home as personal weapons, or that gun-control goes back nearly 90 years.

                Re: ” Resistance on the Ruby Ridge model”.Have you even read up about what happened at Ruby Ridge?Doesn’t seem to me that he was much “resisting” as he was just trying to live his life – and to quote George Costanza ” every time I thought I was out – they pull me back in”.Ruby Ridge is a perfect example of how the government goons will hunt you to the ends of the earth if you don’t give them what they want.  Run and try to just be left alone – and they will show up and shoot your dog, your son, and your wife.Show me on the doll where the Weaver family was doing any harm to anybody – and wasn’t actually going OUT OF THEIR WAY – to just be left alone.

                    @CalsdadExactly right Brother…I wonder if we had the tech back then that we do now if Ruby Ridge would of even happened or Waco for that matter…But when you allow yourself to be isolated that’s when they have the best chance to pull you down which is why I push so hard to get people to form up Communities…You should check my area out the more voices in one area speaking out the more minds that are opened…

                It actually included all weapons at the time including artillery.The reason?The Letter of Marque and Reprisal allowed individual armed merchantmen to attack persons under such  a letter  during wartime or other times.Properly under the intended law  if we had the resources you and I could with Federal permission drop cruise missiles on America’s enemies.We also would not have any standing federal military except for the Navy though this would include Marines and of course carriers these daysThere would also  be militia, State national guardsHowever the 30’s with its drive to industrial  totalitarianism was terrible on human liberty in every respect.As such I suspect in the end machines will end us or we’ll end them.

        Know the feeling.  Had to do something on the upper east side last night and easiest way home was to grab the commuter train at 125th/Harlem–hence a trek through the off rush hour “vibrancy”—the now open call drug dealing in 4/5 station (thank you DeBlasio) a guy pissing on the wall right outside the subway entrance and the usual gauntlet of drunk/stoned/cranked nogs between the subway and the station.  The cops, who under Giuliani would have been rousting the miscreants, were now clustered–five of them–playing with their smartphones in front the the Metro-North station.   It just pissed me off.

Like the old joke goes, If you lock three Jews in a room overnight, when you come back in the morning, somehow they’ve founded nine tax-free National Jewish Councils, stolen your grampa’s retirement fund, and started a war in Yemen.  Similarly, if you lock three monkeymen in a room overnight, when you come to unlock them in the morning, somehow they’ve figured out how to shoot nine Brothas and rape five White girls… but they couldn’t figure out how to unlock the door.

                    It does not take much time at all. The premise of Kelling and Wilson’s “broken windows” theory is correct — it’s elementary, it’s hard to believe anyone ever would’ve doubted it. But millions do.All of the wine-and-dog moms and aunts whose dream was live in Manhattan or Brooklyn forever, on holiday from reality, are in for a very rough 2020s. Add to the problem the retirements of those who started in the 90s with the NYPD — and have some institutional memory of actual police work — replaced by those whose sole experience on the job was scrolling on their phones like every other pod person out there and asking themselves “am I racist?” every time they had to confront an actual crime.Officers Diversity and Inclusion will be in charge soon. Oh won’t that be fun for all of the banksters and their $2.5 million 2-bedroom apartments looking down on the zombies. Nowhere to hide. It’ll be a rout. These people are portions for foxes.

        This is the best video I’ve seen that undercuts the argument that we need to open the borders as it’ll improve the lives of the desperately poor. It doesn’t address the more challenging parts of the argument that immigration is bad for us, but it is a good wedge to open the minds of those who blindly believe in a stupid poem bolted to a nice present the French gave us.

        The Washington Compost article is more TP-USA two-ply that shows the Trump GOP’s inability to crap or get off the pot. Trump’s dropping a Romney by making Hispanics Number One, and his Potemkin 14 miles of semi-restored fence in Otay Mesa shows Whites they’re Number Two to him.  At the rate of 1 mile every 3 months, the Big Beautiful Wall will be complete in 60 years. The smell of this BS makes me want to flush him in 2020.

            If Trump wants a landslide 2020 win he should consider running as an Independent.  At this point he has zero need for GOP backing (he never had it in the first place), and it would galvanize his base to vote.  At this point I’m with you … Trump is eyebrow-deep in the swamp.

                Trump becoming an Independent would certainly free him from a lot of ruling class baggage that comes with the GOP but I wonder if the party actually wants him more than he wants them at this point. Consider that if he goes Independent they have some not very appealing choices1. Scramble to find some new candidate who is sure to lose in a three way race – Trump, Generic Old White Guy Republican, and Comrade Rainbow Diversity Gumdrop. This is the Perot scenario again. The only difference is that Trump might actually beat Gumdrop while Perot lost to President Saxophone Hillary Blowjob.2. Run… nobody? Has this ever even happened in modern times?–&gt; 2A: Run nobody and support Gumdrop. This is also unprecedented and is an admission that the Republican party no longer really exists or has a platform.–&gt; 2B: Run nobody and support Trump. This is perhaps less shocking than 2A but is an admission that Trump IS the party now.

            Since when has a duly elected President actually run things?  It should be painfully obvious to everyone that it is the Administrative State/Crony-Capitalist/Media Complex that runs what is left of the United States.   The US President has about as much power as the Queen of England.  He’s a figurehead at best.

                Noted.  My point is that if Trump wants to be what he thinks he is – a renegade – then he needs to play the part to the hilt.  In the meantime he’s just a GOP president … i.e. a phony.  Or if not a phony, an idiot; same result either way.

You have to tolerate it because everybody tolerates it.  If some would stop tolerating it others would to,  but nobody wants to be first because that means jail.  So we go on passive aggressively planning for elaborate scenarios that mitigate the risk.

        I used to be a “Second Amendment absolutist,” along the lines that Z-man describes.  If I had a nickel for every letter to the editor I wrote defending gun-ownership rights, I could retire.  (Well, not literally, but you get the idea.)  And I agree that self-defense and self-preservation are as “natural” a right as can exist.  But I find myself moving increasingly to  a modified point of view.Blacks should be disarmed.  Blacks as a group lack the intelligence and the impulse control to handle modern firearms (especially large magazine capacity semi-automatic repeaters) responsibly and, as a group, should be disarmed.  The stupendously high levels of murderous criminality in the black community justify such measures.Such a move is by no means inconsistent with the historical understanding of the Second Amendment.  The founders certainly would have agreed that black slaves, Indians and probably even black freemen could and should be denied access to firearms.  None of these people were eligible to serve in the “well-regulated militia,” to which the Second Amendment refers.   Many colonies and states had laws against the ownership of firearms by blacks.How then, can law-abiding blacks defend themselves?  I propose that there be licensed ownership and possession of caplock single-shot shotguns or cap-and-ball revolvers.  These are effective in a self-defense situation, but lack the capacity for rapid-fire mass shootings of the type that are all too familiar in the black community.  You have time to reflect on what you are doing while you are reloading.  Blacks who demonstrate a genuine interest in and capacity for hunting or target shooting could store modern firearms at local government-controlled armories; checked out for limited periods for a particular activity and checked back in again at its end.I recognize that such a solution is politically impossible in the present state of affairs, as it draws an explicitly racial distinction in the exercise of a fundamental right.  Even iits advocacy is probably a form of hate speech and would be denounced by the NRA.  (I suspect the statisticians in the NRA’s Fairfax headquarters, who are familiar with the racial composition of violent crime would be secret supporters.)An even better long-term solution is separate countries.

            How to disarm the Black population—or any other segment—is the question.  The answer is, you can’t.  Forget about Constitutional rights or the courts.  It is impossible.  The only way even remotely feasible is the attempted disarmament of everybody.  You think that the Blacks currently involved in firearms crime are legal possessors now?  Of course not.  They obtain and carry despite a complete prohibition.  You’d need to obtain permission to stop and frisk every single Black person and obtain warrantless searches of homes in Black neighborhoods.  There is not enough manpower in the country to attempt this.
Good idea though.  😉

            We lost the battle wrt 2nd Amendment right’s when the scotus decided we could register and tax full automatic weapons in the 30’s.  Since that is now the law of the land, it is a short step towards the same restrictions for all semi-automatics or even the elimination thereof.  This will have the effect of leaving the deer and duck hunters with their bolt actions and shotguns—restricted to 5 rounds or less without external magazines.  After that, and a settling down time, some incident or another will spark the final push for no firearms in hands of civilians—and it won’t take another 100 years, I’d say a generation or two (50 years) tops.

Most of the problem blacks are already prohibited possessors and it doesn’t help.  They will still be carrying around stolen guns. The only real help would be outlawing their girlfriends from legally buying the guns and allowed baby-daddy to use the gun. Even so, there is zero chance of this happening and so you might as well being a 2nd amendment absolutist. I do not believe there should be a class of people called prohibited possessors or classes of guns that are illegal to buy/sell or possess.Any gun laws you support because it will disarm blacks will eventually be used against us.  That is how gun control started in the first place.

            Thanks no. There is no way you can target the laws effectively, the South’s attempt at this  started us on the gun control train in the first placeAnyone who wants a gun should be able to buy one  and if they misuse it get prison or a bullet.Bedsides  there are plenty of Black folks who are fine with guns and plenty of Whites,   who aren’t. Why bother.Giving this current configuration of government any more power is folly, IMO we need serious wealth redistribution and a cost controlled national  health care system . It’s just we are too corrupt to do it effectivelyThis corruption cannot be one away easily  with, its too deep rooted and as such we will have to fall to our natural level, Brazil basically maybe Italy with some areas better than othersA very brutal revolutionary state willing to go full bore Stasi and hang tens of thousands could break the cycle but nothing less will sufficeAs for the race issues, if you have power enough to somehow make a law like that stick why don’t you just be honest, be  and deport everyone you don’t like.No one will every trade with you again and it will take half the nations GDP for a decade and probably cost millions of more  lives but  you can’t be cheap and half ass the effort, eat the heavy costs and consequences and be done with it.

                Defeat is the goal.  The Uniparty, no matter Trump (a sideshow, he is), has its marching orders.  Posturing otherwise but going down to defeat for the GOPe is right there in the script. Triangulation.  These days, you can at least barely see under the curtain for glimpses of the game being played, if you pay constant attention and use your front brain.

                For the most part I’ve never heard a good word about Wisconsin other than    its White very White , from what i can tell it’s also a rotten place to work   and chock a  block with cucks and other clueless sorts along with crazies of the less showy sort.Bigger picture wise the  people in charge  are scared of the population acting out  but not scared enough to do the right thing, think French Revolution level stupid hereBy the time things get there there won’t be anyone in charge enough anyway.More importantly they really can’t give in. There are a lot of reasons but the very simplified version is we are far over our social carrying capacity and change is always hard till it gets so bad, you can’t help itWe can’t survive that level of bad a societyWorse urbanism and modernity select for the end of modernity , cram everyone into high tech cities, babies stop, complexity makes everything stop working and 200 years from now everyone, the 10-20 % that made it  will be looting junkyards and broken buildings  for scrap metal.That’s a fast collapse  historicallyFixing this would require constraining behavior, heavily  especially elite behavior which beyond the pale for them and against social norms as our societies are liberalIt would also require huge, Roosevelt or more level changes to economics and social policyModern societies lack the energy or social capital  to do that sort of thing as it’s too long term a thing anyway . Most people, Whites included aren’t the kind to plant acorns so the grandkids have oaks to sit under.So we fail.Maybe we  get very lucky and get a reprieve or a civil war  that goes very well or maybe we go warlords and I get my retirement in a gas station fort with some comley slave girls double bonus if we  get life extension before the fall .Or we may just get gradually worse who knows.

            Rumors are just that and there are a lot of fear mongers and black pill shills  on our side often  just out  out to make a buck.Hell  half the time Trump himself floats trial balloons that are just hot air.. Always wait for a while , a few days for confirmation and longer still for actual action  before worrying about anythingSince we are still in the voting stage for a while, you job is to work the  primary system to put in people stoutly on our side. Not an easy task but it’s the way to set up for what we want. We might tiny chance vote our way out or get lucky enough to  end like the USSR but otherwise you or yours will have to take what they wantTake advantage of this  time to get hard, get good and get ready. Good intelligence will avail you more than guns in the long run

            This is low hanging fruit, folks.  Am I the only one here with my mind in the gutter!? Much to Basic Husband’s consternation.  My God…Z handed us the Crap topic on a silver platter.First, what the hell is wrong with businesses these days that they can’t develop a bathroom with the ability to waft away Stink-O? EBMUD’s giant admin building had giant bathrooms that, in the early days, smelled like Hawaii mostly. Then we hit the time when many went all sensitive to artificial scents. So EBMUD changed to some less noticeable way to waft away that worked. Hence no women skittering around with head down. If EBMUD could do it, what the hell’s wrong with the rest of the world! Are we losing stink technology?Also, once we threw open the border flood gates and anchor babies, by the 70’s began noticing we must have started importing people from cultures who stood over big holes. I’d head into a bathroom in SF or Oakland and sure looked like someone stood on the toilet seat and just let loose-who flung dung. From that point in history, womens’ bathrooms really began to degrade.As for women being nutty in this area, I’ll bet western civ women have eons of embarassment about this topic.  Most young women continue to be mortified by their body processes. Then there was the act-out kid in school who, when the teacher turned her back, would rip off a series of armpit farts. There were girls who were disgusted, then there were girls like me holding up Olympic score cards.Lastly, just blame the cat.  Pets are handy. I just say disapprovingly, “Ollie!!” or “Fiona!!” Fiona is shaped like a meatloaf and can actually smile.  Ollie also responds to “Jesus Christ” and “God Damnit!” Yep…that’s the old Bill Cosby routine from the 60’s before he went bad. Works on cats, too!

        Who’s reading this crap? Why – you are, Z. And most of us read it too.
The NYT is not there to inform you. They exist to sell copy and advertising and that’s it. Because they’ve blown their integrity and reputation – that means trolling the readers to get clicks.
And maybe there IS some merit to it. Confronted with a chitter full of lesbians, perverts and drunks – I might be tempted to roll a hand grenade into the open stall, turn on my heel, and go outside to chit on the sidewalk like they do in San Francisco…

            The NYT is not there to sell copy and advertising any more.  It is there to spout the rantings of its leadership, who are wealthy and connected enough to not give a hoot whether the enterprise succeeds or fails over time.  Leadership cares about subscriptions and clicks, for the most part, to assure themselves that the word is getting out.
Much like the mainline liberal churches, who are on a quick nosedive to zero congregants.  They know it and don’t care, because promoting the same rantings while killing the messenger is worth it to them.

                It is interesting to me that all of this liberal stuff is “for the chillins “, but the time preference of their actions is getting shorter all the time.  It is the emotionally driven version of “grab the money and run, while you can”.  I comprehend the money version of it, the idea is that the world burns down and you still have a wad of cash.  But emotional satisfaction is not something you can put in your pocket and carry around while the world burns.  On the other hand, for Libs, maybe they can somehow do that, in their universe.

        Those smart water appliances sound absurd! The only “smart water” appliances I have are moisture detectors behind my toilets, sinks and clothes washer that sound an alarm if they get wet . Sort of like a “smoke detector” for water. You can also buy an automated mains valve that will turn off the water to the house if moisture detectors get alarmed.

            That is actually a really good idea.  An old friend of mine used to work cleaning out flooded basements and laundry rooms when the hoses that go to the washer burst. He mostly dealt with waterproofing issues, but he also got a decent amount of business from the burst hose problem (he was able to write reports that could be used for insurance purposes).  That water detector can mean the difference between a wet floor and a few feet of water.

        I know a number of “conservative” black guys.  All are military vets who bootstrapped their lives into the middle class.  I try to gently nudge them  move them even further towards our side out of habit.

            Who cares. Even if you managed to pull some pitifully tiny number of blacks or Hispanics somewhat over to our side, it doesn’t mean squat. First, their numbers will be swamped by the endless stream of new voters invading our country.Second, their children will regress to the black/Hispanic mean so we’re screwed there as well. Yes, it’s perfectly legitimate to judge a person by their race if you will be dealing with either their current relatives or beyond one generation due to regression to the mean.Screw that “nice” black couple moving into my neighborhood. I don’t how law abiding, intelligent or conservative they are. They are the camel’s nose under the tent that will eventually destroy my neighborhood and endanger my children.
