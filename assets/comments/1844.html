        How Amazon makes money escapes me. Case in point:
My wife likes to use German made Dove soap bars in grapefruit &amp; lemongrass scent. Amazon sells them and last week I ordered twelve bars for her for circa $18 with free shipping. Five days later the soap arrived delivered in a US Postal fixed rate box that would cost me at the Post Office about $7. Their margins have to be thin. Btw, I have Amazon Prime and the order was fulfilled by an associate vendor.Dan Kurt

        My guess: Investors are pricing Amazon based on the expectation that it will become the monopoly online retailer… or that the Feds will allow it to gain the 60-70% market share that will make it the dominant player in the market and allow it to set prices for the entire market.
If some guy selling cars or computer becomes the dominant player, that’s one thing since he just dominates one market.  Letting Bezos dominate retail is another thing altogether, since he can set prices for many markets.

        I had a bookstore for many years and can say from experience that publishers have brought many of their woes upon themselves.  Always ready to cut deals with the largest retail outlets (and Amazon became the largest), they consistently undercut independent store’s ability to pay the light bill.  They now have few outlets willing to pay the rent for a few square feet to display their new product, shine the lights on it, dust it off.  We told customers which books were a good read and had many ways of otherwise developing interest in new titles.  With the demise of the local bookstore publishers have lost a vital laboratory for their marketing and an important partner in sharing the risk and expense associated with the launch of new titles and authors.  It’s really their own fault.

            I agree. It is one of the thing Marx got right. Capitalism tends to eat itself looking for profit. Music did the same thing.
