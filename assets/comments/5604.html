        I gave up tv entirely over 7 years ago, and have zero regrets.  There just ain’t much worth watching.  I’ll go to a bar to watch the occasional hockey or football game, but that’s about it.  Best decision I ever made.

        We cut the imbecilical cord two years ago. Stopped watching local television. Ditched Facebook but kept Twitter. Roku, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and more often than not, YouTube.
No regrets!

        How do these things work, exactly? Do these devices deliver the content in HD? And can you record shows with them? I am a big college hockey fan and one of the things about my current cable that I like is I get a bunch of out of market games- particularly U of Minn. games. any thoughts?

            I’m a college hockey fan as well and I get nothing from DTV. I end up watching games on-line. But, I’m strictly a Hockey East guy.

        I may have found  sports solution for you Z, using Roku and a $20/mo subscription to Sling, without the problems of using Sling.Here’s what a commenter wrote about using Roku:Disqus User Jim C • 9 months agoNo you don’t. I’ve been watching ESPN3 on WatchESPN through my Roku for a year-and-a-half, and I don’t have a cable or satellite subscription. Plus, now you can subscribe to Sling TV for just $20/month (and you can cancel at anytime) and use that subscription to authenticate WatchESPN. I did that a couple of weeks ago. Authenticating WatchESPN through Sling TV gives you a lot more viewing options than just ESPN and ESPN2. And if you add the optional $5 Sling TV Sports package and authenticate your WatchESPN Roku channel, you can use it to watch even more.https://blog.roku.com/blog/2015/02/24/watchespn-debuts-on-roku-tv-watch-disney-channel-and-other-networks-coming-soon/

            I have an Amazon Fire and it has the same apps. Someone else said that Sling was buggy, but I’ll give a shot on the free trial. Kodi is another way to get free sports feeds. I have it loaded on an old laptop and it is rather amazing. It takes some fiddling, but I can, if I so choose, watch Croatian soccer if I want.I did MLB on-line this year as a test. They ran a 50% off deal so I tried it out and it was great. Better than regular TV by a long shot. It’s one of those things you see and realize you are seeing the future. In ten years, all sports will be subscription.

        I cut the cord back in 2013, when the Trayvon case was coming to a boil.Even Fox refused to tell anything close to the truth about St Skittles.O’Reilly kept running that photo of Trayvon from Jr High School, giving viewersthe impression that TM was a harmless little boy who dindu nuffin’.I couldn’t stand giving these crap-weasels anymore of my money.Check out the Roku box or Roku HDMI stick, (though this won’t do much for your college sports jones).http://www.amazon.com/Roku-3500R-Streaming-Stick-HDMI/dp/B00INNP5VU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449085865&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=rokuI bought a Roku stick for $49.00. I also bought a $5.00/mo subscription to Acorn TV.Acorn has most of the British mystery &amp; drama series. (Fortunately, many of the older BBC series, like Midsomer Murders, &amp; Poirot make no attempt at political correctness.) I have no interest in team sports, so I’m not missing much there.Roku has a PBS channel so I can still watch NOVA.Roku also has YouTube which has thousands of good history documentariesfor free. (The stuff that used to be on The History Channel before Ice Road Truckers and Swamp People took the channel over.)Because I’m also an Amazon Prime, I also get their mostly abysmal selection of programming. Roku has many other available channels besides these.I would love to short the cable stocks, with their ever declining subscriber baseand forced bundling of channels that no one watches, but it’s still too soon.As long as cable still has a virtual sports monopoly I believe cable will continue to survive. But if cable ever loses the NFL and MLB, monopoly, cable will be in a lot of trouble.

        I, too, tried cutting the cord with Sling about 3 months ago.  Sling worked great for about a week.  Then, the season premiers started, more people joined the network in droves, and the system was quickly overwhelmed, and the bandwidth wouldn’t handle it.  They blamed it on their viewing app, which was under constant development and never worked right, hanging, rebooting, etc.  It all came to a head during the Walking Dead season premier, which I don’t watch, but apparently I’m the only human who doesn’t.  It not only crashed that channel, but all of the channels for at least a week.  They refuse to use browsers, like everyone else like Netflix and Hulu,  and stick to their app, which never worked right.  Unfortunately, I cut the cord and picked up Sling at the same time.  I should have waited.Before you cut the cord, try it for at least two months.  I plan on trying again, but waiting until the get all the bugs worked out.

            Good to know. They have a free trial so I will do that and see how it works. I’ll most likely use Kodi for most things, but I’ll want ESPN for college sports.

All crises are used as pretexts to move the ratchet of state power ever forward.  It has always been thus and will forever be thus.

        Like you, Z, I only tend to be interested in the news when something unexpected happens. Otherwise it is the same old regurgitation of the tired leftoid opinions you have seen before. Last night here, for example, I refused to put the main news program on because the ‘news’ would be about the Paris climate change conference, and the accompanying images would be full of smug, well-fed people earnestly telling us we have to pay more taxes or the planet will die in the next few years. As this is a message that we have heard at least twice before and are still here, then I know how it plays out. In the studio there will be anxious faces with furrowed brows talking over stock footage of typhoons, poor children looking hungry, chimneys belching black smoke, glaciers falling into the sea, dried crops on baked ground and so on with perhaps a shot of a line of cars in the morning rush hour just to show it is also our fault too, and not just Asia or Africa.But one thing I would say is that the great thing with TV news is that you can treat it like radio and really get what they think. The message is the same but TV news, at least with the BBC here, is subject to either a disapproving or approving tone. If you aren’t watching the screen then you can hear, far more clearly than when being bombarded by images, the sneer or subservience in their voices. A bunch of rabid socialists says this and there is a lifting of the ‘newsreaders’ tone to one of hope and approval. Some right wingers say something else however and you can almost hear the lips curl and the tone shift to one of near hatred.As for the man-made climate change rubbish on BBC news, the tone is one of utter obeisance mixed with hatred of capitalism and joy that more taxes can be squeezed out of people.

            I do the opposite, turn off the sound and simply watch the people.  Remember, 80% of one’s impressions are non-verbal.  Hillary and Obama come across as very deceitful and angry people when you simply watch them speak.  Hillary looks down her nose like the Red Queen.  Obama, Hillary, and Biden like to flash those quick, wide, creepy grins like the Cesar Romero Joker from Batman.  Warren is anger and deceit on steroids.  Boehner is repressed anger and deceit.  Sanders has the anger without the deceit, and a fair amount of earnestness.  Rubio is the TV weatherman talking head.  Cruz is always the tough prosecuter, bearing down.  Bush looks like he doesn’t want to be there, or perhaps just got caught cutting the cheese in a crowded room.  Carson looks the total kind and innocent person, perhaps too passive. Trump, well, he is always passionate, and he just goes, like an Energizer bunny.  He looks like a guy who flat doesn’t care what you think, he is simply pounding away at what he thinks.  But he comes up for air, flashes a cute smile, and all is forgiven.  I can get all this, and I don’t need to listen to all the blather.  BTW, Obamas ears really stick out.  He is an angry-lying-ears-stick-out guy with an awful sneer when he speaks.

        It sounds like a variation on the BBC, except we are not actually forced to pay for it. Yet.
I have been accused many times of getting my opinions from Fox. “I don’t own a tv.” Now they are even more appalled. Not owning a tv or having a page on the social media is considered a marker for serial killers or terrorist.
