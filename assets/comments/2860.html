        The feminine religion you see taking over is probably at or near its peak. The pendulum will swing again. And this particular brand of religion has only been flourishing due to the ascendancy of the Beta male. Progressivism and it’s handmaiden Feminism have attacked western culture on all fronts for decades now, allowing the Beta male to assume roles formally denied to them by Alphas. The point about soccer is a good example, because it is a sport that does not require that which many Beta males lack: sheer brawn. This is why football, a sport for men largely of brute strength, is under assault.I don’t think I agree with your assessment of Islam. Islam is a totalitarian political system using the shield of religion to advance it’s cause. While I do see the parallels with today’s version of Liberalism, I don’t view Islam as over-the-top masculinity. Perhaps a bastardization or mutilation of masculinity taken to its outermost limits? Does extreme masculinity have to equal totalitarianism? Or can men be “manly men” without becoming abusers or tyrants? Western civilization is going to require some manly men to save it, and soon.

        Gobsmacker: The incidence of blacks in TV ads in the UK is very high, and I can recall ads where the ad has a couple enjoying their new sofa or meal or whatever and comprising a black male, white woman. Of course it happens, but it doesn’t happen as much as these ‘correct-thinking’ happy family ads show.The BBC, called by some Al-Beeb for its biased coverage, likes putting minorities on all sorts of TV shows. Of course, the presence of minority people in the media is nothing new at all, but watching the BBC news output these days is both fascinating and disturbing. The BBC at times gives the impression of actively seeking out minorities.The other night the BBC showed the Last Night of the Proms, which for non-UK people is the final classical concert in an annual event that goes back over 100 years. It results in a lot of jolly and slightly bizarre flag waving (literally, as you see the Cornish flag next to say the gay pride rainbow flag) and as people enthusiastically singing such Last Night favourites as “Jerusalem” the cameras seek out faces in the crowd. Mostly they are white and probably middle class; the chav classes don’t do classical music much. This time a Last Night camera settled on a muslim woman, clad in the usual headscarf arrangement, singing “God Save The Queen.” I felt it was weird, not so much that she was there but how necessary it is for Al-Beeb to show we are all one in these islands when the evidence (such as the massive asian child abuse in Rotherham) we definitely aren’t one at all.More to the point, when Glasgow this past summer was going to demolish some slum-like apartment blocks as part of the celebrations of the athletic Commonwealth Games (yes, really… it was to show how forward-looking Glasgow now was) they had two locals being interviewed on BBC’s flagship news. They had the expected Scotsman, and of all things, a muslim man.He may well have lived in these apartments and therefore had a view of their planned destruction, but unless these buildings were the freely-provided habitat of immigrant families there is a fair bet Al-Beeb had to scout round to avoid having two white people giving their views. That would never do.

        For a couple of years, I’ve noticed TV ads have featured black people in numbers that are way out of proportion to their numbers in the general public (i.e., roughly  15%).  Whenever an ad featured a white model or actor, I noticed there usually was a black person in the ad to bring the racial ratio closer to 1:1.  In terms of gender, white women appeared typically overrepresented in ads, which I think is historically the case, but white men seemed to be grossly underrepresented, making me wonder whether there were any white male models still left in the business. More recently, however, I’ve noticed a new trend showing up among the children who appear in ads, which is the gross overrepresentation of young girls and the virtual disappearance of young boys.  It’s as if society had “disappeared” all its young male children and was raising a generation of kids that’s exclusively female. If the stats hold up, such gender bias certainly isn’t by accident, it’s by design, as if boys don’t matter.  It’s very curious…
