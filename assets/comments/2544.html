        Sweet Jesus, there’s no point in even mentioning WA state in this article. They turned the whole process over to the Liquor Board (recently idle when voters decided they rather buy booze at the store). After two years, they granted licenses to a handful of stores and 100 growers. Some counties have been allowed to prohibit sale. It’s the most FU’ed thing you can imagine. The few stores in business quickly run out and the folks still in line buy from the dealers outside.

        What libertarians fail to realize is that the entire point to marijuana legalization is to increase the size of the managerial state and the dependent moocher class that supports it.  With legalization comes higher tax revenues to feed the beast, and higher demand for its services, specifically the taxation and regulation apparatus.  The increase of supply and the removal of social and legal risk and stigma leads to increased use, further dumbing down the populace, making it further ripe for dependency.  At the same time, the private sector, not wishing to employ a workforce of dumb stoners, will institute compulsory drug testing, further encroaching upon individual freedom.  You will also see a vast increase in the local, state, and Federal funded addiction racket, with groups like MADS, Mothers Against Driving Stoned, popping up like mushrooms after a Spring shower, and demanding their cut.  Diabetic Latinos who live with their wise grandmothers who rubbed pot oil on their arthritic hands will be pushed out of the black market as it is increasingly taken over by more sophisticated criminal networks, like the terrorists who run the black market cigarette racket.The logical end result of libertarianism is anarchism (as Murray Rothbard was honest enough to note), and anarchism is but a detour to tyranny.  Libertarianism is not Realistic, it is Idealistic, and as much a child of Rousseau as its socialist enemy.

        Suppression of illegal traffic in drugs or prostitutes or gambling or loan sharking is impossible for economic reasons. Note the NYC cigarette smuggling problem.First, the “legalized” product is always hedged about with various regulations, like those in Colorado, including such things as taxes, prohibition of sales to minors, production limits, etc. These provide openings for criminals who can provide the products more cheaply than the regulated providers. There is also the thrill of indulging in illegal activities for both sellers and buyers.Second, some things are never legalized, e.g., heroin, meth, sex with children, loan sharking, murder for hire. There is always a market for these, and the market is met.So, yes, the Colorado laws are a perk for the upper class who can get high without having to deal with cops.A third note: Illegal activities like drugs, gambling, prostitution and loan sharking are done in public. The fact that everyone is discrete does not mean this is a secret trade. The business has to be public so the sellers and buyers can find each other. This means that the buyers and sellers are known to the authorities and that some authorities in key positions have to be bought off.
