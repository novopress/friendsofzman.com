        No, Putin is not going to sign another deal that would require good faith on the part of the US and Ukies…The Minsk I and II betrayals put paid to that notion..Russia must disarm and neuter the rump Ukraine that will be left, and must incorporate all of the Black Sea access, including Odessa, which will become Russian again..that pretty much rules out any deals and requires unconditional surrender..And if Russia offers the Hungarian, Polish, and Rumanian areas to their native countries in return for dumping NATO and the EU, there would be a lot of pressure on those countries to accept….

            Agree. Putin has already mentioned several times that the final deal will be decided on the ground. Whatever the final arrangement, it won’t require Russia to rely on the US to keep its word.
Just spit-balling, but Russia gets the Russian-speaking portion of Ukraine, the remaining eastern portion of Ukraine will either be controlled by Russia or will be a completely demilitarized zone. Russia will want a river and space b/w them and the West. The remaining Ukraine will be neutral and mostly demilitarized. The larger question is Odessa.

                Interesting. The price for Poland would be quitting NATO, which Tusk at least would not pay, but Austria is not technically a member.
Lemberg it is.

            100% correct.The current West is not agreement capable.Therefore, if Putin wants to achieve his goal that there is no military threat to Russia from Ukrainian territory, he must unfortunately conquer it all and install a puppet regime in the rump state that’s left after carving it up like that.That’s also a genial move to initiate breaking up NATO and the EU as well.I think Transnistria will ask for unification with that enlarged Russia as well then.I hope this will go smoothly and, above all, let the rabid Baltics and Poles become reasonable again and refrain from discriminating against their Russian minority population.

                “refrain from discriminating against their Russian minority population” – this is the biggest dumb fag comment of this post. Ok cheeseburger, why don’t you stop discriminating against blacks or hispanics… hmm is there a reason you don’t want these people in your community perhaps? You have zero understanding of what Russians have done in Eastern Europe and the famous ur a nazi if you disagree with me line has been used by Russians in the Baltics and Poland for 80 years. Sound familiar? Supporting ziggers is like begging your zion overlords to import more shitskins.

poland and romania can’t dump NATO, that would imply they have sovereignty.
to get nato out of those countries, russia needs to bomb the US bases first.

                Probably, the first bombs falling on then would cool their ardor, at least of the normal people. The elites are captured pets of the West and would have to try to pursue the war. That won’t last long before they begin to get the Mussolini treatment and the survivors would scurry west with their ill-gotten gains. Nato has nowhere to go but backwards at this point.

            There is a good chunk of Ukraine that could be given “back” to Poland, but why would the Russians agree to that?
There are no parts, or just very little that Romania or Hungary should claim. Hungarian population in Ukraine is small that the part that used to belong to the Kingdom of Hungary was predominantly Slavic even back then. OTOH, the locals would likely prefer to be part of Hungary than Ukraine.
Romanians could claim Bessarabia, but most of that is now known as the country of Moldova.

                “Romanians could claim Bessarabia, but most of that is now known as the country of Moldova.”
bucovina is part of ukraine which belonged to romania.
Anyway, I hope russians don’t give anyone anything, it’s better for the white race if russia extends westwards than it becoming isolated from europe.

                    But Russia may simply not want to administer potentially hostile areas speaking another language, so it could be a win-win deal…Alternatively, it could simply turn these areas into self administering ethnic oblasts, with no military presence…

                    Poland existed long before the first settlers started coming to what is now the US. Polish king Jan III Sobieski stopped Turkish Muslim expansion in Europe when he won the Battle of Vienna.Just because the country is suffering from temporary mental retardation as a vassal of the United States doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t exist.

        I remember when Biden famously tweeted (or at least someone in his circle) with his phony, tired tough guy act, that Putin didn’t want him to become President. It gives me great pleasure to see that this may be Biden’s greatest failure, which is saying something.

                    Agree.
Winning is winning.  Failing upward is still heading in the correct direction.
Right wingers like to believe that those who get ahead did it because of good old hard fashioned work and fair play.
It’s ideal.  But not necessary.

Correct. They cannot. But you’re on the wrong website for that. You’re here to troll people with “you can’t pass the bar exam” idiocy, as if none of us has ever interacted with a lawyer before or can recognize what you’re doing. What are you, 25 years old?

                                    The bar exam is dramatically overrated as any sort of marker of intellect. Perhaps in the good ol’ days but it is nothing of the sort now.  I am assuming that you and I perhaps have that in common, and if we do I am surprised you would feel that way. I say all this without any malice.

That’s all I’m saying.Couldn’t possibly be nepotism, I guess? His grades couldn’t possibly have been doctored to make sure he “passed”? Like all those brain trust college afleets who beez playin’ football n’ sheeit? Secret societies similar to Skull and Bones are either a myth, or they have scrupulously honest policies when it comes to academic performance on its members’ ” chosen career path”.I don’t know Joe Biden personally, of course. He may be a blazing intellect. Nothing he has ever said or done strikes me as especially deep and perceptive,Shaking down the government doesn’t require intelligence and work ethic, though. (See: Zimbabwe, Uganda, Haiti, Kamala Harris, et.al.). It only requires total amorality and a low animal cunning.Compared to a Master plumber or electrician, men who must know reams of stultifying Code requirements and technical data to serve their customers and communities in real, concrete, demonstrable ways, Joe Biden is a maroon. I doubt if the man has pumped his own gas or bought his own groceries since 1980.How smart and hard working can this fossilized old Vizier be?Maybe the people with assumptions benefiting from closer examination are not the people criticizing Biden’s smarts?Edit: I didn’t down vote you either.

                                        Back in the day when I took it, the USPTO patent bar exam was curved to a 40% pass rate. Some years higher and some years 10%.My state bar exam, Illinois, had like a 70% pass rate back when my fellow GenX dinosaurs roamed earth. The proportion of imbeciles in my trade is shocking. But they can prevail often enough in part because the people living in tje US have been dumbed down increasingly by generation. While not utter idiots, somewhat, they are no morons and still amaze me how easy it is to do my job on somedays. (Female lawyers are fun, while serving as IP chapter editor in chief for a prestigious journal, I had junior female lawyer from a BigLaw submit a case write up that was 50% and some change greater in volume than the frickin’ case itself with concurrences and dissents. Not one of our website’s dissident female wunderkinders. It’s not improving.

                            I didn’t downvote you, but you’re talking nonsense.  How do you think we get all these affirmative action lawyers and doctors?People on the right complain endlessly about academia and then still view academic credentials as being real.Could the average person take the bar exam?  Of course not. They don’t know the first thing about law.  But what if you put them through one of those bar exam preparation programs?  They teach the test.The bar exam is dumb anyway.  There is no way a 2 day test can possibly demonstrate a thorough knowledge of the law.  200 plus years of precedent and hundreds of small print volumes of laws and regulations.  It’s protection of a racket. Professional licensing is a well known racket.

                                The question is not about decision making skills or common sense. The question is whether he’s stupid or not, meaning whether or not he has below average cognitive abilities. He absolutely does not have below average cognitive abilities. Therefore, by definition, he’s not stupid.
If you want to criticize him for anything, criticize him for being wired like the alcoholic that he is. Impulsiveness and easily triggered anger being the most obvious traits with him. Addicts also seem to have some common sense issues.

                                    I never said he was dumb.  I have no way of knowing whether he is or not.   Frankly, I am no position to be throwing stones here.
My only point is that graduating law school and passing the bar is not really indicative of anything.  Perhaps because he passed it in the 60s or 70s, it was a better test than today, but that’s the best thing I would say about it.  But even then there were special treatment for the children of the wealthy, children of alumni, women and minorities.

Biden has been an eff up since at least the days of the Neil Kinnock speech theft.  He had a little personal charm and half a brain in the old days and with the right connections in Delaware, he did ok but he was always somewhat of a joke in  political circles.

                    While what you say is true, it is also true that the Joe Biden led “Biden Crime Family” is one of the least competent grifting operation at the imperial level. I recall reading that his clan have stolen about $25 million, which is chump change compared to what the Bush and Clinton Crime Families have stolen. I expect Obama probably stole more, too, but I haven’t seen any numbers on him, and he is a unitary operator rather than a crime family anyway.

They had to have a seat in the US Senate, and he and Bill Roth were their men. Someone has to do it. Yes they do. Someone has to work in the US government at a high level on their behalf. “Shaking them down.” Right. Other way around, fella.’ They write the checks, as Joe just found out.Imagine thinking he’s some kind of Great Man for simply being the seatwarmer for credit card companies since the mid-1970s. They let him do whatever he wanted: one decade he’s a segregationist, the other he’s a spokesman for cops, then he’s a legal scholar with the Judiciary Committee, the next, for abortion and gays — as long as he delivered for the banks (how about that Bankruptcy Reform Act he and Hillary put together?), he got to play Professor Biden and force smarter people to kneel to his tiny last-in-class law school Scranton Idiot ego, just as you’re doing here.

                        Keep drinking the Kool-aid. I sat on my parents’ patio throughout most of the summer one year studying for it. (I passed, on the first try.) My mom said she had never seen me study so hard for anything in my life. It’s not easy and a midwit can’t do it either. Cognitively, you need to be in the top 10 or 20% to do it. By definition, that means you’re not a dummy. That doesn’t mean you have a lot of common sense or intuition, but that’s not what we are arguing about here.

                                    You’re right but it’s not even in the gifted range, perhaps moderately bright. That’s about +1 SD and roughly 1/6 of the population. Maybe 1/10 with today’s racial mix.
We also seem to be ignoring the fact that it’s possible to cheat on examinations. I have no idea of how widespread it is.

                                        “We also seem to be ignoring the fact that it’s possible to cheat on examinations.”Keep in mind that Biden was caught plagiarizing while at Syracuse University. Also that he plagiarised British Labour leader Neil Kinnock’s speech in his own 1987 run for the Dem presidential nomination. He seemingly didn’t have the intelligence to even write a political speech — and he was then in his prime. Also remember that he finished 76th in a class of 85.I agree that anyone in the top 20% of the white population should be able to pass the Bar exam, though he or she would have to apply himself or herself. But the top 25% doesn’t really mean anything. For whites that probably means someone with an IQ of 110 and above. Top 2% (&gt;135) starts to mean something (i.e., roughly Mensa membership).If you look at some other politicians you wonder about their intelligence as well. Lindsey Graham. John Kerry. Barack Obama.

Gifted people do run the country. I mean people with IQs above 135. The bozos you see on the screen and who put themselves up for election don’t run anything. Front men, marionettes. The problem for gifted people is they can’t interact with ordinary people. Once the IQ gap is over 30 points there’s almost no way of interacting socially or communicating intelligibly. The front men are usually people with IQs in the 110-125 range, who can at least communicate with IQ 100 people.

                                                    Definitions vary. The IQ test itself begins to break down as a barometer of intelligence above the 140 or 150 level — it wasn’t designed to test giftedness but to diagnose retardation. Besides, how would psychologists who usually aren’t particularly gifted themselves measure the intelligence of people smarter than themselves?
A perceptive observer can usually gauge a person’s intelligence within a few minutes. Facial expressions, hand movements, range of vocabulary, subjects being talked about. Using this kind of criteria Biden was not and is not smart. Nixon was. Carter was. (Bill) Clinton was.

                                        Biden is and was a narcissistic, shallow dick who’s never had any desire to think too deeply about anything other than how to get elected and then please his donors.
But that doesn’t make him below average IQ. He’s not a genius, probably ~110 to 115, but that’s still way above average. We’ve all known some above avg IQ people who are intellectually lazy. That’s Biden.

                                                I can appreciate iq as being part of the conversation, but the far right or dr is obsessed with it.  Mr man likes to make fun of people for being stupid , but many of these people are really good with people. That’s a form of intelligence. Making and keeping  connections, doing favors, keeping relationships going, making people feel important or loved is a real skill.  I don’t have that! I think it’s one of the most important skills actually.Biden is also resilient. I couldn’t take all the public criticism. Man he is tough. He just keeps going and going. That’s impressive. Doesn’t mean he’s not evil, but it’s a virtue to stay in the public limelight for 50 years. Not for me but I admire that skill or personality.

                                    Biden’s father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb ofGarden Cityin the fall of 1946,[7]but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[8][9][10]and for several years the family lived with Biden’s maternal grandparents in Scranton.[11]Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden’s father could not find steady work.[12]Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[13]the family lived in an apartment inClaymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearbyMayfield.[14][15][9][11]Biden Sr. later became a successfulused-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[11][12][16]AtArchmere Academyin Claymont,[17]Biden played baseball and was a standouthalfbackandwide receiveron thehigh school footballteam.[11][18]Though a poor student, he wasclass presidentin his junior and senior years.[19][20]He graduated in 1961.[19]At theUniversity of DelawareinNewark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[21][22]and, as an unexceptional student,[23]earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with adouble majorin history andpolitical science.[24][25]Ha even wikipedia says he was a poor student in high school, wonder who they blew to get him into college back then.  His dad ended up a used car salesman, i’d say that description fits Biden.  What is really bothering you that you feel the need to argue about this?

                    If you look at bar passage rates, they usually hover around 80-90% for most graduates of regular law schools (some HBC law schools fare far less, as expected).  There are a few exceptions like California, but that is in large part due to the quirk that anyone can take the bar there, so you have many who had no formal law training taking the exam.But, to your point, Biden is not particularly intelligent in that he has a deep grasp of first principles, can recognize and analyze complex realities, etc.  In short, he is not a “deep thinker” you would associate with intelligenceHowever, he is (was?) crafty and devious.  He has (had?) a certain level street smarts with respect to the streets he frequented – the halls of government.  He knew how to get his, and keep from getting on the bad side of the right people.  So that is a certain type of intelligence.

        This is also why they are desperate to avoid a 25th amendment situation. Could you imagine Harris’ cackling laugh sitting with Putin working out a peace deal if Ukraine collapses? It’s been reported that turnover for her staff has been 93 percent in the last three years, so this lady likely has delusions of grandeur that makes her utterly insufferable.

        “The people running the Biden administration do not want [an agreement ceding the Russian speaking areas] to happen under circumstances, much less before the autumn.”Who are the people running theBiden administration?Denizens of the Transnational EmpireNote that “Forward” is self described asJEWISH. INDEPENDENT. NONPROFIT. It is not a ‘Nazi’ publication. Just like it was 50 years ago, and 100 years ago, and 1000 years ago, there are many Jews who are sick and tired of getting blamed for the bad behavior of the minority.The war in Ukraine has always been an International Jew project because Ukraine itself has been an International Jew project since their ostensible independence in 1991. Their government is like ours, a fake democracy ruled over by mostly alien oligarchs where political order is maintained by a political police that uses assassination as a tool of governance.I hope President Putin shows some pity for the poor stupid Ukies and insists at the end of this that Blackrock, Vanguard, and their various satellite corporations can have no property rights in whatever is left of Ukraine. Rump Ukraine must belong to the Ukrainians, not to the internationalist predators. Similarly, France belongs to the French, Germany belongs to the Germans, Sweden belongs to the Swedish, America belongs to the Americans, and so on and so forth.

        On a side note it’s interesting that since the “debate” of last month, coverage and mention of Ukraine has all but vanished from US media.One wonders whether the unfolding domestic situation in the USA provides a pretext to not mentioning the emerging debacle in Ukraine. The Europeans can say and do what they want — no-one cares about their empty chatter, they have no agency. Pygmies. You need resources to play in this high-stakes poker game.

            Related to that, I’m kind of surprised that they went ahead with Benjamin Bagel’s visit to totally not threaten, bribe and order about not just one, but two sets of politicians in two separate branches of the “government” of the United States to do Bagel Land’s biddingor elseso publicly, when it is obvious that we are under the Do Long Bridge and there ain’t no CO.
But I guess I should never-1. Underestimate the hubris and arrogance of Bagels.2. Underestimate the subservience of Vichy Republican serpents like Mike Johnson to their masters.

Bagel King’s presence in country combined with hundreds of his emissaries delivering this message to every Congress critter, agency head and judge in person will achieve the desired effects. It firms up control in a chaotic time.

                Right? I am curious to know how this works in terms of operating the Empire. You have to assure your vassals and in-absorption-phase satellites that everything is stable and you are in charge. How do you do that when the entire world sees that you brazenly lie to your own people and that you have declared war against the nation that made you what you are.So then, who are the emissaries that can provide those assurances and what proof do they offer that those assurances are good? It is really an astounding proposition to fathom.For all the talk of incompetence, if the GAE can maneuver its way through this you can’t call them incompetent.If however, they are floundering their way through this, you have to wonder if other imperial provinces might be in play for breaking away, how quickly that could happen and what impact even the initial moves could have on the GAE. The domestic implications of defeat in Ukraine alone I don’t think we understand yet. There will be consequences.The Regime is all in on empire at any cost. Rival oligarch/plutocratic factions are likely now deciding if that is the best ship to sail on, or if retrenchment, re-industrialization and focusing domestically is a better ship to break champagne on.We are in some serious waters right now. That doesn’t include the domestic situation where you clearly have new packs of international predators lurking around the domestic scene to see what pieces of America’s domestic holdings and political power in transition can be acquired. (Think Vivek; Think Haley)What is interesting about Vivek is that first of all he is very intelligent and articulate. He is an interesting bell weather because he could just as easily make a play for the Democratic chaos and be an ascendent POC there who could easily own that competition. In all liklihood Biden is the last white man the Dems will proffer as a Presidential candidate. Newsome will have to be happy with the province of California. Not a bad gig as a leading economic administrative zone. They have played their hand and have gone all in with blacks and alien others.So what does Vivek see that he made a play for White America (MAGA)? He is also making a play for “Us”, (as in the globe), being Western Civilization with his Tweets of him and his son . He sees something. Trump sees something and I have heard Claremont guys state that they do not trust him and suspect his own motives. In any case, he sees the clearest potential in MAGA so we must see it there too.There is so much here it is remarkable. I think for us, the lesson is that things are up for grabs. We must strengthen ourselves individually and as an ever more organized collection of collectives. Get strong locally and find other local strongholds to be connected to. We can and will emerge as a force to be reckoned with. The first order of business for Heritage Americans is identity formation, organization and pushing forward to transition from implicit to explicit racial advocacy and representation. The RNC has capitulated on multi-racial-culturalism. We can complain or accept their signaling. We should accept it and move on to that first order of business.

        Putin has the watches and the time.  If his political position and the Russian economy are as solid as both are claimed to be, it would be idiocy to desire or seek a quick end to this war.I would expect a serious attempt to break the Ukranian’s line and provoke a stampede, and I would expect this to be timed for maximum political effect on the US election.  At most, this would involve chasing a routing Ukrianian army towards the river but not over it.  But I am not certain that the Russians are even capable of doing this, if they wanted to.Putin’s problem is that there is no one to negotiate with.  This has been the globalist line in Palestine for decades, but in the case of Ukraine it is Russian truth. (Sidenote:consider that this war was provoked in part as a kind of payback for the Russians saving the House of Assad)Putin cannot negotiate with anyone currently in power in any country that matters.  Even if Trump took office, Putin has to assume that he cannot be negotiated with, because Trump will still not bein power.  Like last time.In the event, Trump’s problem is to erase the image of him as a hapless fool, one which exists inside every foreign state apparatus, above all that of the US.  The solution to this problem is simple: Trump has to take scalps while not getting scalped himself.  The only way Trump can truly acheive power is to exercise some.Fortunately, this is all moral and expedient: the traitors who Trump needs to be seen scalping have already tried to murder him.  Beyond Trump’s person, such a move would have immediate beneficial effects that scale up to the planetary.  Rarely in the history of the human condition could so many personal, political, national and international conditions be improved simply by dealing appropriately — that is to say ruthlessly — with a mere handful of traitors.

            Assuming that Trump survives more assassination attempts and the off-the-charts cheating that is going to happen in November, his only chance of achieving anything will be to decapitate the Deep state, culling whole agencies and departments, throwing the traitors in jail and sacking all the top and middle layers of what is left. I don’t believe that he has the ruthless force of character needed for his or – despite the recent appearance of some powerful support (Musk, Thiel, etc.) the level of support in DC.

        TPTB in this country are desperate to keep Ukraine out of the election.  Trump can run variations of Harris giving 2nd grade level comments on Ukraine and put them on a tape loop.  The public hates this whole project, and always has.  I drive down roads every day that are literally crumbling.  They look like bomb craters in spots.  I’m sure I’m not the only person getting bounced around their car wondering why the hell were sending money to Ukraine.But the answer is obvious: our government hates us.Sometimes I wish I gave more of a shit about Ukraine.  I know some Ukrainians, and they’re nice people.  But I just don’t care, and I hate my government for trying to force their stupid bullshit on me.

        Nice essay.Another problem for the GAE is that the patriots are rooting for Regime failure. Sad, and not a great circumstance, but they made us their enemy.This is interesting that Schumer can’t get applause. Look at Jeffries in the background. I often look at these photos and wonder what is in that person’s head. He seems to gloat.In any case, when The Regime’s head can’t even get applause from his media, and even they don’t buy the, “grassroots support”, gaslighting things continue to get interesting.https://amgreatness.com/2024/07/23/chuck-schumer-endorses-kamala-harris-during-dc-press-conference-asks-for-applause-doesnt-get-any/I hate the GAE.

        Two things to consider: 1) Trump has had two Slavic wives. You’ve got to think he has learned something about the political and cultural ebb and flow just from being around them. 2) All the snakes in government related to Ukraine. Who would ever have known that Ukraine was pulling some of the strings in the United States government? That, in and of itself, is bizarre.

It’s more a matter of both countries have their strings pulled by a third party.
I’m not even sure it makes much sense to talk about countries as political entities anymore. Raison d’etat is a thing of the past, international politics now yield only to raison de banque.

                Definitely not in the West. It’s been clear for some time that we’re run by a not-so-secret cabal of bankers/extremely wealthy donors (bribery), foreign intelligence agencies (blackmail) and a lower apparatus (media, think tanks, party organizations, NGOs, etc.) that fund, maintain and police the system.
And, yes, you should have a lot of parentheses handy to put around those nouns.

                There are differences. There are also similarities. His current wife grew up in Yugoslavia.

            As I see it, the problem is that the US is increasingly unable to project power. Among other things the world has seen that the US military-industrial complex cannot deliver, that Russia has a first-rate military apparatus, and that China will not turn its back on Russia. So the animus of the neocons to Russia becomes increasingly meaningless. They’re just jerking off. Any US statesman worth the name will seek to cut USA’s losses and limit the damage to capability and reputation. Once this neocon and deep state sock puppet in the White House has been ignominiously booted out, maybe his successor (Trump) can do just that. But I could be mistaken in my analysis.

                    The one “They’re bringing back Trump to do [war aim]” theory I never see: He’s being allowed back into office because his everything-is-a-deal shtickisstatesmanship.Western politics is about being uncompromising—with the people. Total domestic repression. “Foreign policy”/”geopolitics” is secondary, but its quagmires can leak. “Gaza” causes Republicans to support hate speech laws and Democrats to let cops punch their street army, undermining both parties’ electoral legitimacy. Etc.The regime mind has (I don’t know a slick term for this)doubly conflatedthe people and Putin. To justify war, their propaganda blames Russia for domestic resistance. They come to believe their own propaganda—instantly, the moment they think of it.Mutatis mutandisPutin is Trump, Russia is a big MAGA hat on the map, etc., and the war is treated with the same reckless disdain the regime shows toward its domestic enemies.Roundaboutly this causes MAGA guys to recognize the MIC/etc. as their enemy. Thatcouldinterfere with projects of domestic repression—withThielwork—which are the only things that really matter, so that war has to end (or stop being talked about in a way that causes trouble).If there’s a regime faction that recognizes this, the only band-aid within reach is Trump. I don’t think that’s what’s happening, but it could be.

                        You have described mass delusion, which in fact is the reality now. It may be impossible to put the madness back into the bottle but it has to be or everything ends in blood and tears. My take has been that Trump is being installed to play Pied Piper to lure young white males back into the military, but the flaw with my thought there is it requires a rationality that is not in evidence. At all.

Nothing is going to lure white males back into the military.  The military was the last on the Woke DEI bandwagon, and it will be the last one off.  And what white boys DEI didn’t drive off, the videos of modern drone warfare making ships, tanks and AFVs death traps and the battlefield a killing zone for robots will surely trump defending “democracy” such as it is.  (no pun intended).

        Putin will lose absolutely all credibility if he decides to negotiate now, especially if those negotiations involve Zelensky—a man who holds no constitutionally valid office in the Ukrainian government whatsoever. Validating Ukraine’s status as a sovereign state would raise serious doubts in Russia about what in the hell the war was even for. Given Russia’s overwhelming superiority in men and equipment, allowing Ukraine to escape total annihilation would simply look absurd. There is no way that anything called “Ukraine” can be allowed to survive this war.Vlad is riding the tiger now. Whether he believes it or not, whether he understands it or not, his only hope is to completely destroy Ukrainian sovereignty, disintegrate NATO, and kick the Americans out of the European continent altogether. The empire will never stop poking the bear until this is done. Russia will never know peace until Vlad decides to get serious and finish the fight, something he has hitherto shown a fundamental unwillingness to do.

            I doubt that Putin will fall for any Western tricks where treaties are concerned. He has learnt the harsh lessons provided by the Minsk “agreements”. Also, there are powerful conservative forces behind him in Moscow who wouldn’t let him do a soft deal. Putin was wrongly accused of trying to influence the 2016 Trump victory. It would be wonderfully ironic if he really did influence a 2024 Trump victory by wrapping up Ukraine in time for The Don to re-enter the Oval Office.

        The Russians are being careful not to take too much territory with Ukrainian (rather than Russian) population.  They really don’t want a guerilla war after the regular war ends.
Odessa is the big question.  If the Russians want it back, they might try a big grab.  Maybe hook-up with Transnistria and solve that problem too.  Otherwise, they’ll just keep grinding.

        Morale is becoming a serious problem as reality sets in on the troops. Insubordination is increasing and that means the military leaders have another constraint. Their soldiers now often refuse to go on the attack or defend their positions.This is why I am skeptical that they will ever bring the draft back over here. You simply cannot construct an effective, modern fighting force by filling it with people that do not want to be there. Ukraine is now in the position of placing their best units behind their own lines to prevent the conscripts from either surrendering or deserting. That is no way to fight a war. Pressing random retards from off the street into service is not a winning strategy.

As our host has mentioned before, the problem always seems to come from Western Ukraine. Rump Ukraine should just cut that area loose and I think the rest of rump Ukraine will be able to live harmoniously with Russia.

            I am tangentially connected to this mess and may have some insight into the civilizational issue underlying much of this aside from the GAE/Zionist part of it.  The western portion of Ukraine, the ex-Polish part also known as Ruthenia, is mostly Uniate or Greek Catholic and likely the Azov Brigade is based there, though I could be wrong.  I hope Russia lets that part go to Poland to deal with the minority issue, though they would probably impose “Latinization” or  even more probably gayification/Americanization.  Cut off that westernizing part and let the Orthodox majority proceed  as a neutral/”Finlandized” state.

                But go back to the 1600’s or 1700’s. The reason they became uniates was because the Poles tried to Latinize them and they rebelled. I think it was called the First Treaty of Brest that allowed them to keep the outward trappings of Orthodoxy, including married priests, while being under the jurisdiction of the Pope. They don’t like the Poles either.But my point is, these are traditionally Orthodox lands.Another interesting tidbit of History. Ukrainian Uniates were rejected by the U.S. Catholic establishment in early 1900s, which tried forcing them into the Latin rite. They rebelled and established their parishes under the Russian Orthodox Church, now known as the Orthodox Church in America. I don’t know what percentage of their heritage parishes were Ukrainian, but it was a lot.The uniates were ultimately accepted by US Roman Catholicism and allowed to establish their own parishes, but they had to submit in certain other ways. For example, they can bring over married priests from the old country, but homegrown Uniates can’t marry and become priests.

                    You are absolutely right about that history.  The Greek Catholic Church I have a connection to is theRussianCatholic Church of which there are I think maybe only ten parishes left in the world, all in what remains of the post Revolution diaspora. I know some Ruthenian Catholic priests but most of what I know of that part of Europe comes from reading broadly and paying attention when it is mentioned.  I for some reason remember distinctly reading in First Things  in the 1990s about a project to establish a Catholic university in Lviv and thinking later that it was probably cooperating with pro-EU and US funded NGOs.  I can imagine that “Western” interests always want to take advantage of any potential fissure in a target nation or culture. The Russian Catholic parish I was married in is a vestige of such a Jesuit project to create a fissure in 19th century Russian culture.I have sympathy for Russia and the people of Ukraine, Catholic and Orthodox, and I want nothing more than to see my own country’s military, diplomatic and economic interests thrown out.  (I can’t say that at a family gathering,  one of Blinken’s top Russia guys married to my wife’s niece is likely to be there and no, he’s not ethicallyChristianUkrainian)   I want them to thrive and be more than a platform for US and Israeli companies and a source of mercenaries and sex workers.  I pray God uses Putin for good and the sooner it comes to an end the better

Yes. The sewer mains in Lviv/Lwów/Lemberg were produced in Vienna a century ago. That city and its hinterlands need to join the EU (return to the Old Empire), and have all the drugs, all the pride parades, and all the pornography that good Europeans demand.
This will allow the rest of the regions known as Ukraine and Novorossiya to live at peace with their neighbor.

        The so-called nationalistsWhy “so-called?” The Azov boys and those who support them seem to be quite nationalistic. Yes, they are doing the bidding of people who would rape and plunder Ukraine in a nanosecond, but it is an alliance of convenience. The Ukrainian nationalists are delusional and suicidal but they seem to at least care about their country. Zelensky and others in leadership obviously do not and are self-dealing but that’s them. When the bribed puppets finally climb to the roof of the American embassy and fly off into the sunset, many Ukrainian nationalists will remain behind, furious at Russia and the Westerners and the well-paid stooges who led them down the primrose path. Ukraine likely will become a hotbed of terrorism unless Putin actually goes scorched earth on civilians. It is just another shameful chapter in the destruction wrought by the Global American Empire, a subsidiary of Israel, Inc.Regardless of the outcome of the United States election, there will be no accountability, per usual, unless one of those Ukrainian nationalists lucks up and finds a soft and truly culpable target. This has not happened in the aftermath of the Afghanistan, Iraqi and Serbian atrocities so those who orchestrated this bloodbath can sleep well based on that past. Even if blowback happens, innocents here and throughout the rest of the West are far more likely to be victims than the warmongers and profiteers. Evil may never sleep but there is no reason for it not to do so.

                    Ukrainians tried the Orban approach withYanukovych. Zelensky was later elected on a peace platform not all that dissimilar, and, of course, Our Democracy means he is president for life or as long as he can be.

                        Quite true. They’ve been going after Orban for years. In our current world, countries will need to choose sides. The Chinese and Russians will definitely put trade strings on their relationships but will generally let your countries live as it wants. The US won’t.All non-Western countries are now working to remove the NGOs and other methods that the US uses to incite color revolutions. It’s all part of the non-West attempting to break away. They don’t want to confront the West, just escape it. But we’re run by a middle-man people who view being excluded as the same as being attacked.

                            Well, he used to be big and scary. The US can still throw a punch, but it can no longer take a punch from many kids in the neighborhood, and it certainly can’t make it more than a few punches before gasping for air.
Ukraine exposed the US and NATO as no longer capable of imposing their will militarily on a large part of the world. It’s a new world. The US is left with economic weapons, even as other economies grow and integrate. The US is a dying global empire, though it will remain a regional empire.

                                But the Baltics didn’t know that when they signed up. The real calamity only became apparent after the Russians exposed US military doctrines to be woefully superannuated.It turns out that fighting goat herders with popguns and cherry bombs for two decades, causes some misconceptions about your fighting power.(Denmark had a brigade in Helmand, next to the Brits, and brought two main battle tanks along. So I ask some tank-dude why the hell we needed tanks against lightly armed guerrillas.He sad the tank  was very useful because a 120mm plaster round was ideal for knocking down gates to Afghan compounds.Whelp! Here I am, paying to send tanks halfway across the globe, and they fire marshmallows?I asked a British guy who’d been stationed in Camp Bastion with the Danes. He said there was basically no job in Helmand that couldn’t be done with a .50 cal machinegun, but when the Danes rolled out a tank, all the usual gun chatter around the base fell silent, so that was kind of nice.)

                                    Thankfully, NATO won’t send troops to Ukraine, not because the neocons (and the idiotic Baltic states) wouldn’t like to, but because it probably couldn’t send more ~60k to 90k in total – and that would take a year to organize and drain every US base in the world of trained men.And that’s assuming the Russians just let them organize in W. Europe unfettered. Even if they got there, the NATO troops would sustain hundreds of casualties a day (which wouldn’t go over well at home) and couldn’t be replaced. The NATO contingent would be forced to withdraw in a few months with its tail between its legs.That’s why NATO won’t go into the Ukraine.

                                        Correct. The British Army currently has 30k front line infantrymen. At current Ukrainian attrition rates, they would last two weeks. That’s assuming they ever reached the battlefield. Notice how even Macron has gone quiet about sending his Grande Armée eastward?

                                Was it Macgregor who said:
“The neocons talk of more war everywhere but the U.S. military at the present time has one campaign in it.   Not one war and not one campaign per each potential conflict.   One campaign total.   We win lose or draw on the results of that campaign.”
Now that was several years ago.   We may not even have one campaign anymore.   If we try in Ukraine it is now quite clear that the Chinese would enter the conflict before they would allow a NATO victory.  Not that they would need to.

                                    Ha. Thought the same thing.
Btw, whites are now a minority of military recruits. No matter how bad you think our military capabilities are now, they’re worse. I’d suspect that our military contains a small but capable, i.e., white, core that could be used as an expeditionary force for short assignments at best.
But that force could only be used for short time and very targeted. The empire is receding.

        The most important fact on the ground is that the Russians are steadily advancing across the entire front, with the exception of the south.If it were me, I would not want to conduct an amphibious river crossing while under fire, either. That sounds like a great way to get cut to ribbons: fording the Dnieper River by trundling along at 5 miles an hour in my BMP. Russia might be using the south to keep Ukrainian units fixed in place and unable to be sent elsewhere on the battlefield. Snipers and harassing artillery can keep the enemy across the river occupied enough that they cannot risk being rotated out of the area. And if Russia cannot get to Odessa, the Dnieper River makes a lovely moat.

            I’m sure that NATO will try and keep some kind of low-key, pain in the ass military stuff going after all this ends. However, NATO will never take any part of Ukraine. If it does, Putin has made it clear that we are into a whole new scenario, and one involving WMDs. I also suspect that very soon now, the West is going to have to deal with far more serious problems than Ukraine.

        For those who don’t believe this is a movie, this woman used to be on the radio here and then left for Denver. I don’t know why, but I was curious about what happened to her and found her Facebook page. No, I didn’t date her and I’m not a stalker, just curious. I guess she’s back home in Michigan, now. (Of course, she’s a commie.)Here’s what she wrote about a recent get together with some of her friends, my point being, that everything is starting to sink in according to plan. Don’t discount that everything you’ve seen the past I don’t know how many years has been orchestrated just for this purpose.Who would have known that Ukrainian interests control so many levers in the United States government if not for the movie? I certainly wouldn’t have. You can’t tell me that this wasn’t by design.Here was her Facebook post:I went to a small cookout at our next door neighbors’ home last night…casual get together.  All of them Democrats.  All of them Boomers, all of them educated, upper middle class white folks…and the conversation around politics, Trump, MAGA etc made me so uncomfortable that I had to change the topic after about 10 minutes.Here’s the deal:  for those of us who are anti-Trump, we are perilously close to turning into Blue MAGA (many already have).  The hostility, anger, finger pointing, conspiracy theories and yes, judgement and hatred that I heard wasn’t shocking, but discouraging.The intense fear and distrust on both sides isn’t healthy for us personally or as a country.  I was honestly disgusted, scared and sad because I LIKE these folks…but wow.  It felt exactly the same as sitting around listening to my Trump loving siblings:(﻿This is not a stable environment for any of us.

            I don’t think I’m following your point.  The Facebook post makes it very clear that her Democrat neighbors are pissed off at the government and sound like Trump voters.
”made me so uncomfortable that I had to change the topic after about 10 minutes”
That is a classic Liberal screaming for a safe space because she is incapable intellectually of hearing any viewpoint other than her own.
Even when it’s clear she was very outnumbered.

                My point is that her DEMOCRAT neighbors, in MICHIGAN, of all places, are even starting to get it. That didn’t just happen by itself. If someone weren’t controlling what we see, everybody would still be in their state of perpetual ignorance.

        Russians are steadily advancing across the entire front
I noticed that in updates this year whereas before Russia would gain ground of a couple hundred feet they are now getting strips a mile at a time in their assaults.  As far as the southern front I had gotten the impression from Russia’s failed offensive there some time ago, that these are mostly manned by civil defense volunteers from outlying territories and whatnot.

            One of things that is so interesting to me is this is completely at odds with their Cold War tactics. The Red Army was designed specifically to unleash a blitzkrieg on Western Europe that dwarfed Hitler’s panzer armies. Frontal Aviation (their Tactical Air Command) was wholly aimed at supporting the Red Army through air superiority, close air support and, interdiction (fixed targets behind the front line such as ammo dumps, fuel storage facilities, bunkers, runways, etc.)The whole goal was speed. It was all about blasting a whole in the NATO lines and using these giant armies called Operational Maneuver Groups to bring a quick end to NATO, something we likely couldn’t have stopped without using nukes. Like in the so-called “Great Patriotic War,” they really weren’t concerned with casualties.Now, they are patient. They used UAVs and glide bombs in place of their tactical jets until they wore down the Ukie air defenses. Now their helos and aircraft can roam Ukraine unmolested with complete air dominance. They advance carefully, more like a river flood than a tsunami, unstoppable and inevitable. Their tactics are brilliant in my estimation, especially when it comes to avoiding casualties.They’re living the Patton maxim “The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his.” The sad thing is so many have died in a needless war.

                If you recall, they tried some kind of blitzkrieg at the outset of the war but it failed. To their credit, they quickly stopped trying to “fight the last war” after that. I’m not breaking any news saying that 21st century technology has made 20th century tactics obsolete. If anyone is to be blamed for hanging on to the past it should be NATO and their retarded “offensive” of 2023. Experience is the greatest teacher, it can educate even fools. It should be noted that for all their industrial deficits, NATO has proven they can force a defensive stalemate against the Russiansas long as they can maintain a supply of bodies to throw into the meatgrinder.﻿

                    I disagree about NATO being able to impose a defensive stalemate on the Russians. The fact is, their best soldiers are long dead and simply throwing bodies into the trenches won’t change anything. The replacements simply don’t have the skills sets or leadership to match their predecessors, let alone the same morale or will to win. No-one in the West talks about “freeing the conflict” anymore because they know that the Russians can’t be stopped.

            What seems to be happening is they bomb Ukrainian strongholds until the Ukrainians fall back to the next line of defense, but often the next line is kilometers in the rear. In 2023 the Russians were going house to house in cities like Bakhmut to clear out the Ukrainians.

        Very sound reasoning. However, if the Russians believe that the Ukies and the West will honor any deal they sign, then they have learned little of these last 2.5 years. The Russians have to fight this to its natural conclusion which means getting as far as the Dnieper and taking Odessa. Oh, and making it crystal clear that any more crap about what’s left of Ukraine joining NATO or the EU will be addressed by Mr Kinzhal and his friends.
