        Relax, it’s merely a sport. Watch, don’t watch. Nobody cares.
It seems every four years it’s so freakin’ cool to NOT like soccer. And most importantly, to tell everyone about how they don’t like soccer.
Yawn.

        Excellent essay, though I assume you’re missing a ‘don’t’ from the last paragraph, about the complexity of the sport.I’m an Englishman who loathes (Association) football. I couldn’t care less if we lose all the games and come home in disgrace. In fact, I’d prefer it. The longer our football fans are overseas, the longer it is before any decent Englishman can visit the given territory again.There is no complexity; it’s a simple game, played and watched (in the UK) by borderline simpletons (such as the Millwall Bushwhackers, a gang of scum who would kick your head in for your accent – as long as they outnumbered you 10 to 1).We have a metro elite, including almost all our politicians, who loudly proclaim their love of the ‘beautiful game’ as a means of establishing their man-of-the-proletariat credentials, but no intelligent person could possible love the sport, mostly because of the hoopla and bullshit that accompanies it.Rugby, that’s a game worth watching and playing.And cricket, though I don’t suppose you guys will ever get that.

            Baseball is our cricket, but a number of Hindus and Pakis here are playing cricket. Where I live I see kids playing cricket these days.
Rugby is an excellent sport to play and watch.

        I was going to watch a couple of the matches, but then I noticed how furiously google(and everyone else)was hyping it, and decided against it. The best thing about soccer of course, are the Millwall Bushwackers.

        “Oh yeah, well, soccer is the most popular sport in the world…”
“True, McDonald’s is the most popular restaurant in the world. But I don’t see you there every Saturday…”
“Oh that’s just, I mean, you’re just, no you don’t get it….Oh my God you’re stupid.”

        I love this essay. It describes, in miniature, the problem of the Leftist Hive in America. Fanatic devotion to effete fashion, and an unearned sense of superiority. Smugness and phony cosmopolitanism. Soccer shares that with Folk music, by the way.
