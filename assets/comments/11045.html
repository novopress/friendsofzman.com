        Unlike feminist women, I’m a woman who loves men. I love my son, son-in-law, my six grandsons.BUT, the one thing that annoys me the most about men, is their misunderstanding of women.So many men think of women of being these weak, overly emotional, sweetly naive, basically harmless   creatures.This is a fundamentally flawed mindset.Women can be vicious creatures, vengeful, petty and definitely blood-thirsty.You cannot look for women to behave in the same logical ways you look at things, our brains do not work inthat manner.Just because we can be soft, nurturing mothers &amp; caregivers, we can also be very dangerous toourselves and the world around us.Women are also instigators, often just waiting for men to do our dirty work.You ignore this to your peril.

            Why is it that our mothers don’t teach us fuck-all about women? Is it the Sisterhood? Or maybe they are preoccupied with de-barbarizing us, but still. I didn’t get a proper schooling in women until I drove my daughter and two friends to school each morning for three years, grade 5-7. The society of women is brutal.

                Mothers don’t teach their sons about women because they’re afraid to tell them the truth.  They silently hope their young man finds a nice young lady who isn’t a f****** psychopath.  This is one area where Dad has to intervene.And there’s another reason which is something I’ve been thinking about women lately.  An emotionally healthy woman like my amazing wife of 32 years is a font of love for her family.  I feel lucky to have experienced this and have given it a great deal of thought as it regards the experiences my late twenties son is having with women.Millennial females have been told they can have everything they want, no they have been told they deserve everything they want and subsequently they are never satisfied.  Because they are never satisfied they are incapable of committing long-term to a loving relationship with a man because no man they have ever encountered is good enough for them.  This desire to constantly attempt to trade up makes it impossible for women to commit.  Notably women are more miserable today than they have ever been.Committing long-term to one man makes it possible for a woman to fully express her love.  That love is rewarded with family, a family she also gets to love forever.  Uncommitted women will never know this love, they will never know the joy that comes from experiencing it and expressing it.  I am both sad for them and angry at them and the system which destroyed them.Do not imagine that this loving condition makes women weak or pushovers, it does not.  Mrs SWR is nothing short of a force of nature.  She is also the perfect foil to my maleness, as I am the perfect foil to her femaleness.  And she is happy and so am I.Our young adult children repeatedly thank us for our parenting.  They look at what destroyed family structures have brought onto their friends and associates and as they have aged they realize what we gave them.  Of course, and this is important, I realize we also gave it to ourselves.What is being done to women nowadays is a crime against humanity and the perpetrators should be dealt with very severely.  The world needs their commitment, their love and their happiness, and the feminists have denied humanity all three.

                    Younger generations are also burdened by two ideas that set them up for relationship failure:1) Being happy is the most important thing.2) It wasn’t meant to be.A person who believes these things cannot be depended upon in matters great or small and is fundamentally unsuited to marriage.At some point or other, there will be unhappiness.  Since happiness is the most important thing, this state of affairs is intolerable.  Therefore, the relationship must not have been “meant to be.”I had a conversation with a young woman who said that happiness was the most important thing.  When I said, “No.  It isn’t,” she was shocked.  So ingrained is that idea in them that she had never heard anyone challenge it.  She asked me what could be more important than happiness?  I said, “Doing the right thing.

            Yes. I’m older and calmer now but I think back to when I was young and dating and if I could have accused some guy that hurt me of rape and messed up his life I would have done it. And so would 90% of the other girls I knew. And we weren’t bad girls we were just very emotional

                Whitney, your remark about not being bad girls is nearly the silliest b.s. I’ve encountered all day. You were not merely bad. In fact, you were deliberately bad, untamed, and lawless. Same as almost every female, esp. when she receives a secular education.There is a potential solution, however, to the perennial problem of female badness, which was noted in ancient times too. As you know, humans can extract an egg from a human body, fertilize it, and return the embryo to a womb for gestation. After a fetus is ready for life outside the womb, it can be fed a manufactured substitute for human milk until ready for solid food.So it seems that the major missing piece of extracorporeal human reproduction is to devise an artifcial womb capable of supporting an embryo and fetus throughout  the usual steps of gestation.  Probably this will be done with living tissue. Some other technical issues will need to be worked out. Immunology, for one. Then the female body will be superfluous, except as a source of eggs in case of technological glitches.What, then, will be the reason for men to tolerate the willful nastiness of girls?

                    Whitney’s callousness is disturbing, but Allan’s even more so. It’s sickening to encounter such cold, raw hatred. I hope both of you do some serious self-examination.

                    This is going to be changed, soon.http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15421734/artificial-womb-fetus-biobag-uterus-lamb-sheep-birth-premie-preterm-infantMice embryos from skin cells and by 2037 human embryos from skin cellshttp://www.nextbigfuture.com/2017/05/mice-embryos-from-skin-cells-and-by-2037-human-embryos-from-skin-cells.htmlTurns out eggs can be made from skin cells but it takes sperm to create a zygote.Of course the dark side of this for Women is that with the new artificial wombs Men will no longer need Women to have kids. When this happens Men and Women will be truly equal and it will be very interesting on how exactly society will handle this. Combine Men able to choose to have children on their own, sex robots and I think a lot of Women will really not like it.Heartlander response is, I believe, the beginnings of the response to this. When Men can have children without Women it will be called hatred.

            Women differ from men in their violence.  When a real threat is perceived, it triggers a state of psychosis, the adrenaline is in the driver’s seat.  I believe I have experienced this on more than one occasion.

        At least with “conservatives” in the castle like the National Review types, they know they’re part of the establishment holding back a resistance. The left is so loony that even when they have the high-ground, they look down from the battlements and think the peasants down below are in charge. I was watching Robert Reich’s show “The Resistance Report” the other day and I was thinking, What the hell is a guy who taught at Harvard and Berkeley and wrote for The Atlantic resisting exactly? I guess the answer is “reality and the American people.” The same could be said for Antifa. Still, I wouldn’t be lulled by their degenerate looks or chain-smoking. Cowards won’t fight, but they can set bombs.

            Same thought crossed my mind many times over the past 8 years.  Not that it took exceptional insight on my part.  Progs control every lever of power in popular culture – media, government bureaucracy, education, etc.  It is always 1968.

        “Cargo cult”.  Perfect analogy.  Should have tried throwing them a few cans of Spam.  I generally refer to them as LARP’ers.  Remind me of the time we accidentally booked a hotel in Boston in that was HQ for the ComicCon convention in the adjacent convention center.  Though the highlight was my son getting up on the second floor balcony and in best Shrek voice, admonishing “all you fairy tale creatures, get outta ma swamp”.  They were not amused.  Like antifa this dress up thing is apparently very, very serious.

        “In both cases, it was the women who had the greatest thirst for blood. Similarly, the Manson gang’s women were the ones hellbent on murdering people.”
I was once told that in the SAS — and this may be true for many special forces — when you are confronted with a man and woman, both armed and with deadly intent, you shoot the woman first. The male will often surrender, but never the female.

            I did some research on violence awhile ago, and there were very different evolutionary pressures on men and women in regards to it. Male violence is largely symbolic, as it is about dominance.  This is why most battles only result in a few % casualties to each side, even if the battle lasts all day. Women are passive, as they pass on their genes if they submit to whoever wins, no matter which side.BUT… if they are faced with a real threat they go mad-dog and can’t surrender. This is why self-defense trainers wear those silly padded suits when training women. They have to goad most women into aggression, and when they are successful the woman can’t back off so they have to let them pummel them so the woman gets used to violence as a normal thing.

            Antifa is a smoke screen, a diversion from the real insurgency. When the attack on America happens they and the rest of the SJW movement will tie down LEO assets while the critical infrastructure is attacked by the trained revolutionary fighters inside the US (100,000s).

        “Many of the geezers I saw at the protest were just reliving their youth, if they ever stopped living their youth. The younger ones though, they are romantics. They believe the world needs to return to a better time when they were the radicals and people cared about their issues.”I think this is due to social engineering, not some Spenglerian cycle. Why does society romanticize the 60’s? They don’t. The media does. There was a social change during the 60’s. It was not a natural, organic process in which the cosmos somehow readjusts people’s natures. It was engineered. Everything that is still destructive in our society today can be traced back to the 60’s. Admittedly, the changes in the 60’s already had precursors in earlier times, like the deliberate betrayal of the Federal Reserve Act, the 16th Amendment (Income Tax), the 17th Amendment (destroy State control by democratic election of Senators), and the 19th Amendment (giving women the vote). All of these things were done to impose hegemony over the White citizens of this country. The 60’s were no different. The positive portrayal of the 60’s revolves around the Civil Rights Act, the rise of the new priesthood of the television media, promotion of individualism over group conformity, feminism, pedestalization of youth culture, and the pernicious effect of the media led crusade to remove a sitting president from office. There are those that lived in the 60’s that realize that all of the “positive” things have been detrimental to this country, but as long as all forms of media present these occurrences as being a noble, “progressive” improvement over a toxic, patriarchal society, subsequent generations of immature youth will seek their own moment in the sun. So, all the powers that be have to do is provide it and the children will flock to it. We have all of the same elements. “Oppressed minorities”. “White privilege”. “Oppressive Patriarchy”. And a sitting president that “must” be removed to prevent America from betraying its promise and values. Of course, the oldsters will show up to provide “I remember when” commentary. “I remember when Columbian pot started to be imported. It was there at my first menage-a-tois. Good times!”

        The Antifa crowd is what you get when natural selection is perverted by long-term affluence and the demise of real hardship. In its place, we have substituted government grown dependence and the attendant loss of personal dignity. These people can no longer work (or excel) in order to earn their survival; their sole talent is pitching-a-fit and whining.

        Z Man;At this point, after reading some of the comments in the previous thread, I’d recommend a post of your usual high quality about provocateurs, how they work and what to watch out for.If the many and varied armed federal police forces so wastefully deployed by the deep state aren’t working the alt-right by now, they are even more supine than usual.  It’s not like a couple of Prog USAG’s didn’t demonstrate their right to rule by stating on the record that disgruntled vets. are the real internal threat, and really not guys with names containing the word Mohamed somewhere in the string.Tl:Dr, whoever says something like, “Hey, enough talk already ’bout dem Joooos dat run da whorl.  Let’s us go and torch a synagog.” is a provocateur/plant.  You can be sure anyone stupid enough to be so easily enticed will be furnished with nonflammable gas-smelling fluid in a lured red can plus matches/flares, etc and pointed at the local synagog with the best, hi res video cams, or some similar setup.  For addl. info. on how this works, one can read the now-regular arrest reports of the pop-up jihadis that are flooding the zone as we speak.The purpose of deploying provocateurs in addition to merely the usual informants* is two-fold: Decapitation and dissension.  IOW, by taking out hot-head potential leaders the agency in question also spreads fear and dissension  within the group in question.*Informants are usually some jammed-up knucklehead smart enough to be useful but not smart enough to think about going rogue.  Usually it’s drugs.  So somebody living an open criminal lifestyle who appears unconcerned about apprehension is to be avoided for any number of good reasons.Best defense: Know where the line is, don’t cross it.

            When I was active in my local Tea Party we had a “volunteer photographer” who documented everything, took pictures of everybody and everything at all of our events and whom I am certain was an FBI agent undercover, based on his behavior, quiet unobtrusive but ever-present demeanor, and so on.  He was quite literally always available for us.

                Did you get his pic. too, just in case_?  Pics of the informant doing his documentation work might have provided useful material in a borderline entrapment* court case.  At least as long as the ‘rule of law’ sorta lasts.One big danger in provocation from the agency side is their agents’ getting a little too enthusiastic about putting another pelt on the wall, crossing the line over into the entrapment* zone and blowing the case on that basis (if the defendant has a good lawyer and there is some evidence in his favor).You’ll notice that the accusation of entrapment is a standard Muslim Brotherhood ‘go to’ defense for injudiciously enthusiastic locally sourced jihadi’s.  It’s a tool in their constant law-fare vs. ‘the old America’: A brush back pitch to gain space for sharia law.*Entrapment Defense = Wooda never gone down sept da Man tricked me into doing it.  Sometimes that’s even true.

            It should be abundantly clear to anyone on the right by now that Sessions intends to pursue his own agenda as the AG and has no intention of serving the Trump administration in any capacity.
I’m astounded at how many people, even on the right, believe that somehow the AG is an independent official, rather than part of the administration they serve. When did they stop teaching basic Civics?

        I have been to one protest rally. As a college student I checked out the No War in Iraq rally because I thought instead of just whining I could do something. The place was full of ugly people who I tend to avoid and then after about 30 minutes came chants about homo acceptance. To think I had come all the way into the city for this! Now I just stick to whining.

        Excellent observations as always. I wonder if they (the Antifa leftists) know their “certificate” is all but filled out. I reckon they don’t. That’s the way denial works.
But what role will they play in society when the racket has run its course?
Will they just disperse and find other things to do? Or will the anger linger on?
That is what I find fascinating. Wondering what is next.

            They’ll try to go Alt-Right.  These people have nothing else but being on the (socially acceptable) Radical Fringe; it’s their entire identity.  For most of the 20th century, that meant being on the Left.  But the pendulum is swinging, and soon the Radical Fringe will be out on the Right.  Today’s SJW is tomorrow’s obergruppenfuhrer.  It’ll be important to police the ranks — “have you ever used the word ‘intersectionality’ unironically?  Is there a gender studies course on your transcript?  Banished!”

        I think that among WASPs (yes old term) in America individualism is very strong. There is a lot of research that indicates a tendency towards individualism versus collectivism is genetic. This may explain why a white identity movement is coming so late in the game – WASPs are not by nature “joiners” with strangers. Blacks can see any other black and go “we black!” even if they never met. Whites not so much – whites tend to only join others they know well. And because Protestants schism every ten minutes (unlike Catholics) WASPs tend to stick to small groups. (Note: Anglo Saxons is a general term, in reality it includes Celts.)Illustrating with humor:A congregation that got into a heated argument as to whether or not Adam and Eve had navels. Finally one group split off into their own sect: First Church of the Navelites.The reason we white people fight so often among ourselves is that we’re always assured of having a worthy opponent.Note: white people are also the highest risk takers. That’s why horror movies have white people in them. As a general rule (except for tokenism) there are no black people in horror movies — for the obvious reason that everyone knows black people run like champion athletes (no matter how fat they are) in any scary situation. Would be the shortest movie ever.

        Z it was an honor and pleasure to meet you, and I just regret we did not have more opportunity for longer discussion. Unfortunately there was that antifa incident after lunch and the attendee who was attacked happened to be a personal friend. So I was involved in trying to track his whereabouts and fate until he was released Sunday afternoon.Which is also why I was late getting home, and am posting this only now.One more check mark for Richard Spencer. He set up an on-line funding appeal for our casualty.  If you go to this link you will find the sort version of the incident, a few pictures, and video.https://www.wesearchr.com/bounties/amren-attendee-ambushed-by-antifa-legal-and-medical-fund#comment-3449273068No White Man left behind!

        OK, the participants were, as it seems, united by the Antifa trying to riot on the conference premises. But please, Z-man, tell me, are you sure you really saw such an idyllic picture inside the gathering itself?I am asking because not so long ago, there was some news of a serious conflict between the alt-right galleon figures. Spencer and Friberg on their site giving a what for to Greg Johnson, obviously in reaction to his own prior attacks on them. The subject being quite common inside besieged political organizations and movements: essentially, who stole money from whom and who tries to take over control over the good honest rank and file in the movement. Now  you report all three of them there, at the same event, with Johnson you even spoke, and you observed no trace of this shoot-out?I don´t want to know because I cannot live without gossip or smth. The issue may be essential for the thing you yourself hold so dear. Namely, conflicts like that one Friberg/Spencer vs. Johnson happen all the time in organizations that someone wants to undermine, provoked by infiltrated agents. There is plenty of examples from the collapsing Soviet empire in the 1980ies and 90ies (suddenly redundant KGB and its satellite secret policemen in the Eastern Block trying to prevent the emergence of new political infrastructure) as well as from the process of dissident right movements development in Europe at present. In the latter case, agents of sitting regimes use the full power of their offices to undermine the genuine opposition.  In any event, all the basic features of the staged conflict are present, most importantly, it usually being about money, not ideology.The funniest is, of course, when not just one, but both sides of the fight are later uncovered as agents provocateurs, in most grotesque cases even serving the same intelligence agency. If this is the case here, I bet Friberg/Spencer are somewhat higher ranking officers than Johnson, whom I would place somewhere on a cubicle drone level. This is mainly because the official alt right site has a class to it, is mostly intelligent and readable, whereas the snapshot of CounterCurrents I decided to take made an impression of worthless amateur narcissist crap.Anyway, given that you decided to leave your ebony blogging tower to socialize with dissident right personalities at close quarters, it should be your prime objective to decide how you move about in a crowd in which a major part come from the cloak and dagger quarters, maybe even of more than one nation. Thrilling, I admit, but also frustrating at times, I assume, to just act like an extra in a protracted spy show.

        While on my balcony in DC reading this this morning, smoking, thinking of the past and the future at the same time (http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=10128), and worrying about hopes for nothing more than a violent denouement (http://voxday.blogspot.com/), I wondered about my own fumes.
In a sane society the Zblog would not exist.  So what are we going to DO about that? The progs still have a vision of a future.  What is ours?  What are we going to DO?

            First things first. Build infrastructure, then use it to push the counter culture. The infrastructure that already exists is entrenched and based on ideas and technologies that are obsolete. Best to bypass it rather than try and repeat what the left did ala Gramsci.The new infrastructure includes platforms like this but must extend to news, education, secure communications, and most importantly, finance and law. We need networks to securely fund projects without outside interference and we need radical lawyers to back us up until we are in charge.

                Agreed – where we are now is the early stage of what needs to be put in place to reach our people and be able to reach, inform, and inspire to action. it will be most likely an open and somewhat competitive process for the people who are best able to influence the course of events to emerge.
