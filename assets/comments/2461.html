        BTW, open heart surgery causes severe depression. I have opted out. There are worse things than dying.

        In 2009 Robin Williams had open heart surgery for several arterial problems that pediatric researchers have been saying for years are the end-stage sequelae for developmental PTSD – that is, the kind of PTSD that occurs in children before the age of 14 and is never processed with a responsible adult when they happen. The children are seen as “doing fine” when in reality they dissociate, mentally move out to left field…and overcompensate with things like acting out via comic responses to an insane, scary world. Or going to a mall and shooting people.I recommend reading Bessel van der Kolk. He’s been looking at this in depth for about 40 years, first at Baylor and then Harvard.  He says the huge spike in heart disease is due to d-PTSD. Somebody consistently abused Williams as a kid, when he couldn’t escape except thru his head. As van der Kolk says, “the body keeps the memory…” and turns it into heart disease, arthritis (and other auto-immune disorders).His reported generosity was a good example of trying to buy security. And Jonathan Winters is another example…lots more.

        “frustration that Robin expressed at having to take television and movie roles he didn’t want to take, but had to for the paycheck”
Most people spend their lives working jobs they do not particularly like. And even if they like the type of work they do, they have to work harder and longer than they would like. And sometimes have to please people they don’t like.

        The brain is an organ and organs malfunction. A depressed person cannot will himself to good health any more than a cancer patient can.

        I’ve begun to hear a number of public service announcements on the radio about suicide.  Apparently there’s been a significant amount of grant money from the NIH dumped for that purpose.  Perhaps it was a big amount on a single nonprofit that submitted a stunning proposal or a change in criteria within the NIH for granting.Whatever, here’s what I see coming.  I predict a huge spike in suicides.  Between Williams checking himself out and the media blurb, folks on the cusp of deciding to end it all may realistically examine the option again and just do it. Many people are susceptible to suggestion.  The baseline number I recently read was 30k per year.  That’s 2,500 per month.  Maybe it will become the new fad like piercings and having yourself “inked.”  There’s something self destructive in the human psyche.

        All true, and the pious reaction of the cultureverse is more than a little sick-making.Still…..Another part of the public reaction that is more than a little nauseating is the proud scorn for clinical depression that everybody’s so happy to confess (Matt Walsh, you, apparently, lotsa commenters)WhatIthink killed RW was his embrace of relativism, which is to say that his world was so hip nobody believed that anything was true. And that’s deadly if you’ve got clinical depression, believe me.Depression is something that nobody knows shit about unless they’ve lived in it, believe me. Imagine Satan sitting on your chest every morning explaining how everybody would be better off if you’d just check out. And then the rest of the day gets worse.It’s like a cancer in your mind, and everybody just thinks you’re feeling sorry for yourself. Why is it that alcoholism is now regarded as a sickness but depression is still regarded as mere self-indulgence?Time to wise up, kids. There’s gonna be a lot more folks drowned in hopelessness around, the way things are going.

        I was told long ago by a medical professional who had seen a lot of suicides that carbon monoxide is the way to go. Self-strangulation would be last on my list.
Anyone who would hang himself is already certifiably crazy, just my opinion. But it does also seem to be an aggressive act. The message I get is–fuck you, whoever you may be.

        Jonathan Winters was the original Robin Williams.  I’m not saying Williams slavishly copied Winters, but the true ground breaker of zany, genius comedy was Winters.
Money problems may have plagued Williams, but I wonder if he was a victim of his own high standards and was depressed by the realization that he could never be as good again as he once was when the comedy was fresh.  He was a tough act to follow, even by himself.

        Well, so I don’t find it too odd that people mourn his death.  If you really enjoyed his work, then you would be sad that he is no longer contributing and supplying you with that enjoyment.  Your world is a little bit different now that a favorite figure is no longer a part of it.  I was bummed out when Breitbart died for instance.  He did some great work.Anyway, what I do find odd though, is the degree of public collective emoting that people all engage in now.  Have you read Phillip K Dick’s: “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?”?  Do you remember the concept of Mercerism in the book?“The main Earth religion is Mercerism, in which Empathy Boxes link simultaneous users into a collective consciousness based on the suffering of Wilbur Mercer, a man who takes an endless walk up a mountain while stones are thrown at him, the pain of which the users share.”I get that people will be bummed out – we don’t like change in our lives.  But people were really really upset, like it was a member of their family that had died.  And they took to social media to publicly rent their clothes and cry out the pain they were feeling at Robin’s passing. Very weird and Mercer like.  But maybe it’s me who is wrong, and big public mourning displays are normal, now the scale is just different thanks to the internet and social media.
