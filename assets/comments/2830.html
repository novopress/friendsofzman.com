        Narcissism has a lot to do with it also.
Young men getting their own names or birth-dates tattooed on their chest or back? What, in case they forget?

        The girls with the sleeve tats are going to look plug ugly at 50. And the guys with the 1 1/2 inch ear gauges are going to look like Deputy Dawg in their dotage.” Where have you gone, Joe Dimaggio, a nation turns its weary eyes to you?”

        Always sad when you see someone with lots and lots of tattoos, because you know (as they must) that they have run out of body space to mark and any future new trend in tattoos will have to pass them by.
Also, almost all of them are really, utterly wretchedly ugly and will fade to uninteresting dull shades as time goes by. As it does.

        Tats and piercings, interesting perspective.  When I was in the Navy (’66-’70 WESTPAC) one of the other facets of Sailor lore was it was customary for those who survived a Ships’ sinking was those survivors would have an ear pierced.  Not so much today but back in the day’, you know, of “Wooden ships and Iron Men!!”Got Gunz??,III%,skybill-out

            Further back, sailors pierced their ears with gold rings to ensure a proper burial. The person performing the burial got the gold. A black pearl in the ear meant your survived a ship wreck. Sailors have a lot of lore and legend tied to tattoos and piercings.

        Several different motivations, methinks. Low self esteem is certainly one. So is high (however debatable that is) self esteem.
I can’t offhand recall a tattoed individual who was articulate, so perhaps the inability to distinguish oneself is indeed a factor.

            Tattoos seem to work like cliches for most people. They are not a starting point, but an end point. The most interesting thing about heavily tattooed people is their ink. The rest of them is dull as dirt.

        I’m voting for self-mutilation. Tattoos are so ubiquitous today that one could even say they are a way to conform, rather than set one apart. Or maybe the barbarian hordes are growing. Either way, I wonder if the people who get tattoos because they imagine themselves “hip”, will regret them once their skin wrinkles? It’s not going to be pretty.
