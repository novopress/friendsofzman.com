        I disagree with quite a bit here, Z. Assange was useful in that once again the who/whom distinction was brought into sharp focus and the Regime got another black eye. His alleged victims consisted of entities such as the Military Industrial Complex and the intelligence services and their political and Cathedral toadies, all of which work tirelessly to oppress the people they supposedly serve. If Assange had obtained and published private information about, say, the National Rifle Association or Vdare or a young white school boy who said unfashionable things, he would have been the recipient of institutional largesse and held up as a paragon of virtue. Instead, he gave Hillary Clinton and Mike Pompeo the sadz and thus became A Very Bad Person Who Had To Be Destroyed.Regime media indeed remained silent, and we only know many details about this case due to the fringes. After all, Regime media operates as a hit squad on opponents of and irritants to the Regime. It is shocking that the State house organs didn’t affirmatively target Assange for more open destruction on their pages and airwaves, but sometimes hypocrisy gets too over the top even for them despite it usually being a non-concern.Is Assange a scumbag and a hyper moralizing POS? No doubt. Did he render a good service even if for all the wrong reasons? No doubt. As forGenerally speaking, what the regime cares most about in the case of these leaks is the source of the leak and the method they usedthat misses the main reason for the panic. The Regime was embarrassed among its elite friends at home and abroad so Assange had to be destroyed. If the very same information had gotten out and made them look good and moral somehow, the Regime would have been perfectly fine with it. Little people whose lives have been destroyed by doxing know this perfectly well.It would be wonderful if harmful information about everyone and everything could be contained and people not be hurt, but some pigs are more equal than others. Assange did a good thing for the wrong reasons, no matter how loathsome he is.

            In the theoretical world, whistleblowers and leakers could be considered heroic.
in the real world, when was the last leak that made any difference?
Snowden was a true believer; caught thousands in government violating privacy laws protecting ordinary Americans daily. Result:
Nothing happened. In fact, it got worse.
There are no more Church Commissions.  The men responsible for reigning in government excess are terrified of the beast they created.
Whistleblowing on leviathan is pointless.

True as far as a policy change. In the insular world of the elite, though, anything that makes them look bad among their peers is The Worst Thing Ever. Assange managed that.
To your point, though, all the Church Commission did was transfer police state powers totally to the Left. It did make some folks uncomfortable on the D.C. cocktail circuit, so there was some value there.

                Eh, I’m highly skeptical of Snowden’s motivations, but certainly not of the results. Snowden is the rare case of an in-place asset of a foreign intelligence getting his cover blown (whether to support or protect other intelligence assets) and being a highly positive outcome for the American public. No way he was working alone. The information he had already leaked implied a package of intel far too voluminous for a guy of his position to be cleared for. My speculation was either the Chinese or Russians were running him, or a joint venture between the two (hey, these are strange times indeed) and he was encouraged to play drama queen to obfuscate an op going on.Doesn’t really matter, he didn’t really reveal anything that wasn’t already known, but he did draw a lot of atyention to it. Americans got riled up for a few minutes then went back to sleep. But…all fun to speculate about.

                    Or maybe the GAE’s intel department had gotten so sloppy and incompetent that he really did have access to all that. That’s the other explanation. But yeah, in a properly functioning system he wouldn’t have had that kind of access by himself.

                “Fictional”, not “theoretical”. In theory, whistle blowers became a protected class under, ironically, the Obama administration. Americans largely don’t care about this sort of thing, if how fast they grew bored with Snowden’s song and dance was any indication. There’s been quite a few whistle-blowers aside from Snowflake Snowden and….nothing. hell, if anything, the American public proved itself more than willing to play harder into having their privacy raped.

            I think Assange was a true believer, and I can’t hate a guy who gives my enemies a black eye.
However, Assange is obsolete in the modern age. Now any schmuck can easily push all these docs to a distributed network like IPFS and it will be around forever. There is no need for a middle-man to send it to to host.

            I agree that who/whom overrides all other concerns in this case.
Values that are very important to traditional whites, like not stealing, fair play, and free speech should only be extended to our own because the out groups won’t reciprocate.Stealing from someone who is not an enemy is wrong but stealing from the enemy is often excellent. Who/whom. In group/Out group.

        The U.S regime was initially pissed thet he released a video of the ‘good guys’ brassing a bunch of civvies from a helicopter and then doing the same to passers by that tried to help the victims. Followed by revelations that when more ‘ good guys’ arrived they refused medical attention to the kids in the van that had copped a load of ‘friendly fire’. (Collateral murder).Apparently that was a national security concern.I don’t care what kind of douche bag he is. That sort of outright murder should be seen by the tax units that pay for it.

            The Power Structure considers anything that calls its moral legitimacy into question a “national security breach.” Perhaps more than anything, the Power Structure fears that the masses will morally recoil and turn against it, perhaps violently. This explains, to a large degree, its hysterical overraction to the J6 tiff. It also explains the Power Structure’s attempt to destroy Trump. He’s a Big Man with a big megaphone, and he has made a few unfriendly noises about the Power Structure. And we can’t have that now, can we?

        John Swinton, editor of the New York Sun, had this to say about the profession of journalism in 1883: “There is no such a thing in America as an independent press, unless it is out in country towns. You are all slaves. You know it, and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to express an honest opinion. If you expressed it, you would know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid $150 for keeping honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for doing similar things. If I should allow honest opinions to be printed in one issue of my paper, I would be like Othello before twenty-four hours: my occupation would be gone. The man who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the street hunting for another job. The business of a New York journalist is to distort the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to villify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread, or for what is about the same — his salary. You know this, and I know it; and what foolery to be toasting an “Independent Press”! We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are jumping-jacks. They pull the string and we dance. Our time, our talents, our lives, our possibilities, are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.”With that said, I have a much more mixed/positive opinion of Assange that Z-man does.  It’s because of Assange that we had the DNC leaks and it’s because of him that we have the Podesta files – he deserves substantial credit for Trump’s election and that is why he was ultimately ruined; I also appreciate how long he held out against this unrelenting globohomo pressure.  I believe Trump would have pardoned him but according to media reports McConnell told him that the Republican Senate would convict him in his second impeachment if he did so.  I previously covered Assange in depthhere.

            I worked in newspapers for about 15 years from the mid-’80s up to 2000. Sometimes as a reporter, editor and photographer, and a lot more as a behind-the-scenes guy managing newsroom computer systems.What I learned was that journalism is totally corrupt, even in small towns — maybe especially there. But the mechanism is the same whether it is a small or big market:Most reporters work a beat of some sort — police, courts, statehouse, entertainment, etc., and your regular contacts on that beat are the people who work in those environments. A famous saying in journalism is “The job of the newspaper is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable”But the truth is, if you do too much “afflicting the comfortable” all the regular sources on your beat stop being willing to talk to you. It’s an incestuous relationship and it favors those in power. Meanwhile if you piss off one of those poor afflicted, well, that’s barely a speed bump. He doesn’t control your access to your beat sources.Also, reporters frequently get on beats without much regard to their intelligence and skill sets. Schools of Journalism rank right down there with Schools of Education for attracting those with very poor academic skills. In the words of Trump, “They’re not sending their best and brightest.”

                I think there should be a distinction between journalism and journalism, inc.Those autists on Twitter and Substack are technically journalists; they just recoil from the label, as they should. But they are journalling our times, are they not? And they’re doing a useful service…they don’t answer to an editor, and they certainly don’t have friends in high places.Which is one of the fault lines between the local normie/regime hack and real dissidents…we understand and accept bias, and are fine with the proverbial “dudes in their mother’s basements” or “dudes in West Virginia hideaways” since they give a wholistic approach to the Current Thing, with life experiences and voracious readings to back them up.This is good enough for me…journalists don’t need “sources” which is what regime hacks are talking about when they cry about “disinformation”. You see, a Washington Post reporter has “sources” so s/he obviously knows what s/he is talking about!But in fairness, I do miss that short period of time when some shlub would traipse down to the courthouse or meet some low-level pol at a bar to get some insight into the inner workings of City Hall. I wish there were more dissident “journalists” able to do that.

                            I agree about the conflation of opinion and fact in journalism today. Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether a piece is an editorial or a news report. However, properly understood, journalism presupposes investigation, or at bare minimum, reportage. Punditry, on the other hand, is opinion, speculation and philosophizing. Nobody will ever mistake Z’s work for news reports.

                Yep. None of them do any gumshoe “investigative journalism,” they just repeat what they are spoon-fed by the cops and the government at press conferences.My own (somewhat limited, but nonetheless firsthand) experience with “journalists” is that they conceive a “story,” then “interview” people who will give them a one-sentence or one-paragraph blurb to confirm their pre-existing bias.Even that has now become antiquated in the age of feminized journalism. In both print and television “news,” it seems all they do is hire chubby 22-year-old girls straight out of undergrad for $15 an hour to do “news stories” about adopting puppies and kittens.

                    A little thing I like to do on any news story these days is do a search on the reporter — find their personal website (90% of the time they have one), their Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.It is most often as you say — vapid little girls with boutique liberal beliefs in way over their heads.Another thing that is happeninga lotin the local news area is that activist non-profits masquerading as organizations interested in promoting “fair” journalism sponsor seats at local papers — paying some or all of the reporter’s salary. This is irresistible to cash-strapped local papers. So, the activists get individual bylines in newspapers all over the country. It looks super grass roots, but they’re all serving the agenda.

                        The libs complain about Sinclair Broadcasting and the stories they mandate their local stations carry that have more of a right-wing bent. Our local paper is now owned by Gannett and I’ve noticed they do the same thing.I forget the year, but it was within the last few years Gannett decided to do a series on violence against Asians. It was basically the same story recycled in most of their papers. It was comical because even in a newspaper like the Chillicothe, Ohio Gazette they were running stories about how unsafe it is for Asians.Asians can’t walk the streets of Chillicothe without being gunned down. Of course I’m being facetious, but they interviewed one girl who grew up in the town of Portsmouth, I believe, and she was complaining about how all the kids teased her in school for her Oriental features.Just my personal opinion, but Gannett is/was based in the DC area. (Headquarters just moved to the New York area.) You know some political operative from the Democrats must have had the ear of some Gannett executive to run this series of propaganda.And let’s not forget how many times we read about some miracle cure only to be bombarded with a series of ads promoting a new drug for that very ailment. Yep, I’m sure that wasn’t all orchestrated. They read that story and 24 hours later they had commercials in the can ready to roll!

                    “Yep. None of them do any gumshoe “investigative journalism,” they just repeat what they are spoon-fed by the cops and the government at press conferences.”To add, this is mostly pragmatic. You know how academia has a “publish or perish” orientation? Well, so does journalism. There’s a tremendous pressure to have a story ready for publication every day, maybe more than one. It is pretty rare to have the luxury to spend months doing deep investigation while being allowed to have your daily output suffer. There are pages to fill. Even newspapers that were flush with cash generally only had a couple special investigative projects going at any one time — they’re expensive award bait. Good for prestige, but they don’t much move the scale on daily subscriptions and advertising sales.Sometimes you’re sitting there, calling around and there’s just not much that’s very newsworthy, so you pull out your press releases. Or maybe you’re just lazy, or you’re legitimately underpaid and they’re just not paying you enough to be a crusading angel for truth, justice and the American Way when all you want to do is pay for your kid’s piano lessons and put something away for his college education and your retirement.And that wasbeforethe crash.

                    There is another type of “journalist” or journalistic “practice” that I encountered at my old institution.  Damn if I forgot what they called it, but it was the equivalent of academic plagiarism—except seemingly accepted practice in the industry.I got a call from a reporter that they wanted to do a story on the excessive waste in the then current distribution system for software we used in the labs.  If we wanted to use a particular program, we’d need to “buy” individual copies of the software for hundreds of PC’s—when in reality, all we needed was one copy of the software distribution and copy such 100’s of times.  Storerooms over flowed with CD’s, license agreements, boxes with serial numbers as proof of ownership, etc.  Such was the situation in the beginning of the “dot-com” explosion.The reporter never showed up, but sent a camera man to obtain B-roll and such in the dept lab’s and storerooms while talking me through filming on the phone.  Turns out that this story was *not* original.  The reporter (?) was simply reading a recent article from the Wall Street Journal and adapting the premise and content for local distribution.  Quite shameless about it as well.  As an academic, such an action at that time was the worse academic faux pas and grounds for termination or expulsion.  After the fiasco with the President of Harvard, perhaps not so much today.That was the first and last time I ever allowed a reporter into facilities, nor spoke with one “doing a story”.  I simply referred them to the university information office and they went away.

                        Often the story is written before they even contact you.  They’ll interview you for 4 hours and then take a 10 second clip of something you say out of context to make you look foolish or dishonest. None of the other footage or questions/answers ever make it into the story.J. Bruce Ismay is one of the most maligned people in maritime history.  Every single word printed about him in the press was a lie.  All the historians know this, but these lies are repeated even today, over a hundred years later.  I use him as an example because it was 100 years ago and remains to this day and is totally apolitical.  There is no subject they don’t lie about.

                “Most reporters work a beat of some sort — police, courts, statehouse, entertainment, etc”
Does this still exist to any real extent?  Take the cop beat.  Every major police force in the country now has youtube, twitter and an entire press office.  Really, it’s a lot cheaper and faster to just reprint press releases than to employ someone who has to go down the police department and hang around and ask questions or monitor the police radio to show up at the scene to take pictures and write a story.

                    Well, economics have affected it a lot, and I got out of the industry before the massive crash of the newspaper business. I talked to a guy a while back who’s a section editor at the paper I used to work for, and things are pretty grim. Massive downsizing, so maybe they don’t have the staff to populate individual beats the way they used to, but I guarantee there is at least some splitting up of topics and responsibilities just because it makes sense organizationally. They used to have multiple people on the cop beat (day and night, city and suburbs, state LEOs, etc.). Maybe now the guy who covers city hall is also doing all that now, as well. That, of course, increases his incentive to merely process press releases.

                I’ve always thought journalists had trouble putting things into perspective. They always used to sensationalize things that are trivial in the whole scheme of things. They frequently never bother to compare what they were writing about to the whole. (Not the best example, but like when there are a dozen people protesting at the state house or city hall and the media tries to make it look like masses of people are angry about something.)But I’ve always intuitively thought what you wrote to be true. But to add to that, you’re also dealing with personal biases, groupthink and, quite frankly, human nature. It’s hard to bash , criticize and publicly destroy somebody you’re on friendly terms with. (Easy to do that to people you don’t know, however. Part of it is just human decency.)

        “He was doing the same thing major media does all the time, namely revealing secrets about the regime.”I’m not sure major media in the West does reveal secrets about the regime. Maybe once upon a time. Nowadays they seem complicit in propaganda and covering things up. They are an arm of a regime that governs by fear, surveillance, propaganda, and arbitrary punishment. The Hunter Biden laptop issue, for example, disappeared into a black hole. Likewise for who blew up Nordstream 2. Likewise for the genocide taking place in Gaza. Likewise for the backdrop to the fracas in Ukraine. Most of the people commenting on this blog probably get most of their information from alt media, just like I do. I don’t know what the motives were for what Assange did (pecuniary or otherwise) — but I welcome the grubby secrets he revealed about the GAE.

            There’s a reason Z calls it the “Regime media.” It is nothing more and nothing less than the propaganda organ of the power structure. I don’t see how anybody could even question this verity.

        I was always somewhat ambivalent about Assange. On the one hand, it was clear that he was a lefty and was celebrated by the lefties who saw him as a latter-day Daniel Ellsberg. On the other hand the Deep State/National Security State clearly saw him as a threat and bared its fangs trying to get him, thereby exposing the First Amendment freedoms as a lie. (Recall that the U.S. executed Julius Streicher, who never personally killed anyone, simply for publishing an anti-Semitic newspaper. “Free press,” LOL).Like Ellsberg, though, I’m not sure the information Assange released did much of anything to change war policy. It simply served as a confirmation bias for the the leftists who wanted to use war as an issue against Republicans, but conveniently dropped their outrage for the warmongering of the Clintons and Obama in places like Serbia, Iraq and Afghanistan. The soldiers they regarded as criminals when Bush was CIC became “heroes” for the Left as soon as Obama put lesbians and trannies in frontline combat positions.As a dissident I do not have a dog in this fight. The Founders were ungovernable rabble who would have had no problem stealing British military secrets and publishing them. But they would have felt that way because they revolted against British imperialism and martial law. They would be aghast if they could see how the U.S. has degenerated into an imperialist, militaristic Leviathan with zero regard for civil liberties, no different and perhaps worse than what they accused George III and General Gage of.

                That indeed was his main “crime.” Assange gave the wrong people the sadz and made them look bad on the cocktail circuit. Notice that specific harms or crimes never were the subject of much focus. No, Assange was A Very Bad Person. His offenses had to remain generalized since the specifics were what normally passes as journalism. If the identical information he released made the Beautiful People look good, he would have received the Medal of Honor.

            With the Left it has always been, “Kto, kogo?” Who, whom? They are unconcerned with principles. Instead, they pragmatically deploy their outrage or approbation based upon whether its target benefits or harms the Left. And, I must say, this is the proper approach. For that reason, whether Assange and journalists in general are dirtballs is immaterial. Using litmus tests such as “theft of information” is a mistake. Rather, we should ask, does the theft of information benefit or harm white people? Arguably, Assange helped us because he harmed, at least fractionally, the most powerful anti-white force on the planet, the BFE.

        Mencken was the greatest critic of his profession, branding them “a gang of pecksniffs.” There’s a book by that name collecting his pubic attacks on journalism. Amusing as always. His diaries, released decades later, are even harsher. He also was censored in both World Wars because he opposed them. So much for “freedom of speech” when it really counts.

            Lots of banger quotes about war propaganda and journalism in general from George Orwell’s “Homage to Catalonia”“Early in life I have noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper, but in Spain, for the first time, I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie. I saw great battles reported where there had been no fighting, and complete silence where hundreds of men had been killed. I saw troops who had fought bravely denounced as cowards and traitors, and others who had never seen a shot fired hailed as heroes of imaginary victories; and I saw newspapers in London retailing these lies and eager intellectuals building emotional superstructures over events that never happened. I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various “party lines.””―George Orwell,Homage to Catalonia

        Also, another question is: why was Assange released now?Here are some theories:– That globohomo no longer sees Assange as a threat given its metastasis/complete takeover in the past decade;– That they expect Trump to win and they want to get ahead of a potential Day 1 pardon giving him credit;– That they’re worried about their horrifically decreasing legitimacy or making Assange more of a martyr;– That they plan to kill him once he’s out; or– they broke Assange and he lost his mind; his prison conditions have been deplorable…And another question is: what are the terms of release? As Sundanceargues, he likely would not have been released if he was still considered a threat.

                According to the following article Trumpwas told behind closed doors thatif he pardoned Assange he would likely be convicted by the Republican Senate in the second impeachment:
“Carlson then claimed that he had heard Assange’s pardon was being blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who sent word to the White House informing Trump that if he pardoned Assange Republicans will be “much more likely to convict you in an impeachment trial.””

            They did make it a point that Assange remove and destroy old material he had but also any unknown new material he may have that hasn’t been released yet and they said he needed to prove that it was destroyed.How does he prove he destroyed unreleased material they say they don’t know about?Sounds like he has a lot more that hasn’t been released and they know it and don’t want an election year repeat of the disgusting DNC emails, this time with Joe instead of Hillary. Joe’s brother even has a private island, imagine that. And what could have been found out about in Ukraine since they can’t use it as their playground anymore. Obama has been involved there since he was a senator. Biden’s money laundering there is probably the tip of the iceberg.So, it was probably a release him or else scenario, and no we won’t let you bring him to the US either, so they had no choice.

        Assange revealed American war crimes which the authorities had no right to keep secret. This idea proposed by Z that he stole something – that all information is property – is some weird Silicon Valley thing.

            Pretty much the opposite of Silicon Valley. they operate on the premise that is yours is theirs, so they can profit from selling it. That said, you want to say that government property is public property, then that is fine. There is an argument to be made there.

                Funny thing. I went down a weird rabbit hole the other day. I wonder what happened to the Pacific Pride commercial fueling stations. So I go on their website and find that many of the affiliates that accept the Fuelman card, I also places that Pacific Pride customers can use. No reason for this, I was just curious what happened to them.I never heard of Fuelman before, so I go to their website and start looking up locations where you can use their card locally. A couple of days ago I got a postcard from them in the snail mail.

        I went to a Trump rally in 2015 just to check out the show.  He started off with a bang;  Pointing to the media gallery he began “See those people back there?  Those people back there?  Those are the WORST kind of people.  The WORST!”
Ya gotta love him just for that.  And it helps understand why they hate him so much.

        I don’t see why the citizen of a foreign country owes the U.S. anything including the keeping of secrets.Of course the GAE believes it has global governance and global alliegiance because it is GAE.Australia should take offense at the fact that a foreign government is claiming sovereignty over one it its citizens who never even stood on the foreign government’s land.Definitely GAE.I disagree with the Z-mans sweeping judgement as to “information thieves” deserving our scorn.It’s not that some jornalists and doxers don’t deserve the rope. They do.But the reason is that they are national traitors and disruptors of the social peace.A foreign national such as an Israeli or a Chinese or a Russian or a Zimbabwean or a Japaenese or a German should do everything they possibly can to steal information and undermine the GAE. That is an heroic act.As a digression the notion of intellectual property is questionable at best. Men have always taken ideas from others and made use of them. The notion of intellectual property is a Jewish one designed to collect perpetual rent for doing work once. It is not theivery because an idea once borrowed does not disappear from the originator.

        Well there’s journalists and then there’s regime stenographers. Or as Orwell said, “Journalism is printing something that someone does not want printed. All else is public relations.” But I have a hard time classifying Assange as a journalist simply because I can’t tell you one single thing he’s ever written. He is, or was, more of a conduit for information, sort of a (seemingly) freelance intelligence clearinghouse, the nobility of which depended entirely on whose ox was being gored.This being an ostensibly dissident blog, you’d think Assange, being one who not only irritated the regime to the extent he did, but also compelled it to remove its mask, would come in for at least slightly better treatment. Putting aside the irony of the denunciation of all journalists by our daily scribbling host.

        ‘Information is property and people who traffic in stolen information should be treated like any other thief. In fact, they should be treated more harshly. Stolen property can be replaced, but stolen information is often irreplaceable and the damage that ensues from its theft can last a lifetime. Information thieves should be killed on the spot.’But who’s info did Assange steal?Do not the gov pukes work under the public purse?Is their time not time paid for by the public. The information they try to hide under spurrious and ridiculous security concerns headings belongsto the people.Assange was just revealing their own information and murders to them.

        Look at this one positive fact: Every day the national debt continues its exponential growth, the interest paid on that debt does as well. If there is any net economic growth in America, it certainly is not exponential.So what does this mean? Sometime at, or most likely, before that interest consumes every cent of taxes paid, the whole shebang comes apart at the seams. The Government and their entire host of bitches won’t matter, Official Media won’t matter, and Lawfare won’t matter either. When the value of bribe money approaches zero, the bribes and blackmail won’t work anymore.A total collapse of the American Empire is at hand. It will be pretty bad, but at least the people who run it won’t have the power to keep them from becoming targets. This is what it will take for Americans to accept the fact that certain people won’t stop being troublemakers until they’re dead.

        Journalism generally selects for scumbags. However, they have in the past been a necessary evil. How else to distribute and amplify the Pentagon papers, the crimes Snowden revealed, WikiLeaks, etc. All of these instances, while seeming to change nothing, have been more grist for the mill in furthering the suspected illegitimacy of our system and it’s minions. Conspiracy theories become provable facts. COVID and its aftershocks were perhaps the final blow to the beast that eventually leads to its slow death. The recent Supreme Court ruling regarding government’s ability to pressure social media companies to censor information it doesn’t approve may be another nail in the coffin for perceived Supreme Court illegitimacy. As trust in our institutions rightly disintegrates, a vision for something else comes ever closer.

        We have whistleblower protections to encourage the disclosure of facts of continuing harm so the harm can be reduced and future such acts discouraged by punishing those responsible. On paper.

            Notice how the media only ever entertains the regime approved whistleblowers. Just look at how they treated the guy who found himself in possession of Hunter Biden’s laptop.

                That’s the reason I disagree with much of what you wrote today. Assange was not Regime-approved and committed the high crime of making it look worse, if that even is possible now. The man became Public Enemy No. 1 because he gave the wrong people the sadz almost to the point it impacted their cocktail parties.

                The British establishment media campaign against Assange—led by the Guardian, the world’s most “intelligence”-aligned/controlled news outlet—has been more relentless, insane, and dishonest than the American regime’s against Trump.There’s something in what Assange did that uniquely infuriates them. And it continues to. They’re defaming him on his way out, and it doesn’t look like they’ll stop.To me he seems to have been a totally normal amateur “investigative journalist” (pass-through for secrets). All along, his fans and enemies—especially the progressives who switched from one to the other when the tv told them to—have acted like over-the-top caricatures of fans and enemies.Wikileaks was one of a hundred “old internet” repositories of purloined letters. Assange was one of its principals. And…?I don’tgethow he became a protagonist. I wonder if he does, or if he’s in a Kafka story.

                    It is not so much that Assange became a protagonist, even though what you described is exactly what happened, than it is who his antagonists are or eventually became. His enemies often are psychopaths, and his main crime was embarrassing the Beautiful People. The latter is even more the case in Britain, where the intelligence services are even more subservient to the Ruling Class than in the States. Do not for a nanosecond discount that making the Viscount of Upper Cash uncomfortable at a dinner party can result in a MI5 wet job.Assange thought he was doing the left-leaning Ruling Class a solid, and initially he was, but it backfired. After all, it was journalism, the holiest of holies, right?Great comment as always, by the way.

How do you know this?  In Britain there has been pushback,legislatively, against the transgender nonsense. Even the Tories have had to concoct a repatriation scheme for the illegals. The US has done what? Maybe you have access to some esoteric knowledge but from where I’m sitting the US looks to be much more servile.

            Revealing the crimes of the US government, no matter how inconvenient for the government’s minions, is protected by the US Constitution…But unfortunately, the Constitutional scheme is too weak on enforcement, so it’s an extremely dangerous right to exercise…No one can convince me that chopper pilots mowing down a dozen Iraqi civilians with a mini-gun and laughing about it, is a lawful activity, or one that needs to be kept secret because it might inconvenience a government….

                I suspect there was a lot more of this kind of thing going on in WWI and WWII (and definitely in Viet Nam…ask any pilot who dropped bombs in Loas) than Americans are prepared to accept.
Something like a quarter of a million Iraqi civilians died during and in the aftermath of GW II. That’s on soldiers hands, following lawful orders.
The mini-gun footage was scandalous because it disrupted the usual propaganda of the American GI handing chocolate bars to grateful children.  But that’s just how Americans wage war.  Always has been, always will be.

                    War is ugly. Period. No matter who is prosecuting it. Those who go looking for sunshine and smiles in a combat zone are engaged in a fool’s errand. American soldiers weren’t much worse or better than other soldiers. The problem is, we’ve been told they’re palladins on white horses. They’re not. And when we see they’re not, the narrative is queered. Of course, these days “queering the narrative” has taken on a whole other meaning…

You’re right: it’s something that we American citizens need to know about. What is our tax money being spent on? Why are we funding this? Thanks to Assange, we have more clarity.

        We are living through an inflection point in human history.Never before have our noble class and elites been under such close scrutiny. The internet made journalists obsolete overnight. My own mother chides me for being a fool – “normal citizens aren’t smart enough to do their own research and fact checking; that requires a professional journalist!!!” (To be fair… she is a lifelong shitlib ditz and is now an 82 year old harridan).Regardless, no regime on earth can operate in the dark, behind closed doors, or under the table with impunity anymore. The entire citizenry is now in place to gather, correlate and analyses raw data from disparate sources and assemble it in order to draw useful detailed theories from it. These massive data dumps really don’t tell us much that we don’t already know. Who needs a smoking gun to know that someone has been murdered when you have the bullet ridden corpse, eyewitnesses and video and audio? Everyone knows Epstein didn’t kill himself, everyone knows Barack and Mike murdered a gay chef in the mansion, everyone knows Covid and the war in the ‘Kraine are scams and psyops.Credibility, not information… will be the new coin of the realm… and our elite are now bankrupt.

        What was Assange’s connection to the US?  He got the information from Bradley Manning (whom Obama pardoned) but he was not a US citizen.  He did not owe any loyalty to the US.  Was he in the US or was the data trasnmitted from the US enough for the US to claim jusrisdiction?  I guess the GAE claims global jurisdiction as it sees fit.

        In the era of civilization, being a renegade is typically accomplished via the information domain; non-approved speech, non-conforming written words, the expose´of photos, videos, recordings, or documents that the powerful find objectionable or potentially harmful. Assange got railroaded via the judicial process and lost a couple decades of his life, but Seth Rich got shot in the back. More than a few of the Clinton whistleblowers met this fate. They are playing for keeps people. But what they did is not a warning, it’s a challenge.

        Assange is a bit of a weirdo and a degenerate, but he helped expose the immorality/scumbaggery of our ruling class.  Between the “Collateral Murder” tapes and the Podesta leaks, he exposed them for what they are.  Plus, I always thought it was BS that the US government had any jurisdiction over him.  He was a foreigner on foreign soil.  Besides, it is probably only a temporary reprieve.  I have a hard time believing he will fade into obscurity.  He’s a media whore and always has been. He loves being in front of a camera too much.  Expect another book soon.

        Surely there are duplicates of the information Wikileaks possesses. Holding the information is easy but releasing it? Not so good as we saw.
He’s definitely not going to fade away but paraded around by those who think he is a hero. The other day Tucker was speaking to a group in Australia and it is evident how Assange’s treatment will be going forward from certain Righties. The celebrity sluts may be queuing up to bang this guy again.

            At this point Wikileaks has nothing of value to anyone other than prove that Seth Rich as the source of the DNC leaks. My guess is Assange had to either turn it over in such a way that it could not be replicated or prove he did not have it. That was the deal.

                The martyrdom of Saint Seth is the weirdest MAGA guy fantasy.
Its icon is a photo of a gay Jew wearing a dollar-store Independence Day Loser costume in mockery of normal Americans. SAY HIS NAME! And in his name, pretend “Bernie bros” are righteous non-partisan patriots and nobody has ever died in a meaningless violent idiot black attack.
“The Russians did it” is a likelier story.

I was with you until there. If the Regime did not use a cut out to liquidate Rich (pro tip: it probably did, despite his former usefulness), Shitavious did for some unknown reason, and God knows that also doesn’t merit much notice.

        “…stolen information is often irreplaceable and the damage that ensues from its theft can last a lifetime. Information thieves should be killed on the spot.”Wow, I predict much controversy in the commentary today.  😉My first impression/thought is taken from the above quote.  The moniker, journalist, does not begin to cover all the information thieves.  Just about every startup, and most of the successful ones to be sure, who distribute “free” app’s for your computer use—traffic in “stolen” information.  That is to say, your personal information.  They are just a tiny bit more circumspect in that they lure you into signing away those rights via an obtuse “user agreement”, which few read, certainly none understand, but all sign.Take my new EV automobile.  Ford monitors the car and tracks wherever it (me) goes.  If I attempt to block such, it no longer updates and ceases to run eventually.  And of course, before then most “features”, such as navigation ceases to work.  There is a video out where a geek type stripped one of these cars down to the computers, then broke into the computers and dumped the records being kept.  Everything imaginable.The very last step in the Orwellian State now upon us will be the introduction, then required use, of digital currency.  At that point, we are all slaves.

                    It depends. If it’s your run of the mill police blotter rape that nobody hears about, then there’s probably some truth to it. But if it’s lead story/top of the page/famous man rape, then I immediately assume shenanigans. After all, if you can get 51 CIA people to lie about a laptop, then you shouldn’t have much problem getting half a dozen women to lie about a sexual assault.

Charges were eventually dropped, but it was never determined whether he was framed by a French rival, or she made it up to get asylum and money.

                    Sweden has put into national law what US universities basically established under their code of conduct rules.  As such, the sexual encounter must be consensual, however if the girl has a few drinks on, you’re screwed.  I believe in the Assange case, he (and she) was having a pretty good time and at one point decided another condom was unnecessary.  The female half of the trist regretted this afterwards and the charge of some form of rape was filed upon her official complaint.   However, I heard that this charge was finally dropped while Assange was taking refuge in his embassy sanctuary.My memory might fail me however.

                    I remember back in the 1980s when I was in college, the popular opinion we were taught by professors was that a woman would never lie about something like rape. I’m sure there are people who still believe that, even though over and over again that has been proven to be BS.

                        Of course that’s pure BS.  However a bigger, perhaps biggest, problem is that when a women is caught “dead to right” in a false accusation concerning a man, she has almost a *zero* chance of being charged criminally for the crime of false testimony.
This is the primary reason women are so irresponsible—they are never held accountable for their behavior.  Men learn accountability the moment they get punched in the face.  Women, not so much…

They don’t say anything, they “bump” into you.Women speak without words at certain stages, in certain situations, amirite?  Body language.
It’s a mating dance, as formal and defined as any animal courtship.Don’t sqwauk when you should peck, don’t peck when you should flap your wings. That sort of thing.

        The primary reason for Julian Assange’s release from prison was the election of an Australian Labour government that openly supported it. That and Australia’s eagerness to host American occupation forces. Any journalist will definitely think twice before ever publishing unapproved intel again. And the “conservative” Supreme Court has given the American regime the go ahead to sensor social media (which is practically the only independent journalism currently in existence), so they probably figured they could afford to be somewhat magnanimous.

            The thing that the court got right about that ruling was that “social media” (big tech in this case) eagerly and willingly wants to be censored, ergo it’s not really censorship. You’ll note that it wasn’t them bringing the case. Which, if they had, would have given it the standing the court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked.

A few months ago cuckservatives were laughing at recently appointed Justice Shanika’s musings that the First Amendment should not interfere with government. Now cuckservative justices are joining with her obsequiousness to power. The clown show never stops.

                This ruling lined up real neatly with which justices are friends of the regime/deep state and which ones have some independence.

        How then to deal with regime secrets, Zman? Would this case make Assange one of those “rough and dirty men in the night” to do unpleasant but needful things?  To be fair, I admit that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.

        Information is property and people who traffic in stolen information should be treated like any other thief. In fact, they should be treated more harshly. Stolen property can be replaced, but stolen information is often irreplaceable and the damage that ensues from its theft can last a lifetime. Information thieves should be killed on the spot.
Right effing on Z, that’s how Europe leapfrogged ahead of Africa. YT stole all their knaw-ledge from the Bantus. Wakanda wants its sheeyit back.

            All kidding aside.  Here’s a pointer—Xerox Research Parc.  Do some searching wrt early history of human computer interfacing and icon use vs command line typing, etc.  Folks like Jobs stole ideas shamelessly from them.  Apple from Xerox, MS from Apple, and so forth.  No one has completely clean hands here.

        I would agree with Z, mostly, if the information stolen belongs to or is about a private citizen doing private citizen things (e.g., on the doxing, for example).
But if it is about government doing nefarious government things (redundant), then I would have to disagree.  IMHO, Assange falls into this category.

        I can see your point about doxers, but Assange didn’t steal private information. He published information that by rights belongs to us, and was kept from us to hide the criminal acts of our rulers. The rulers claim divine right to do what they want without consequences, and think we have no right to do anything about it. We need unauthorized leaks to know what they are doing to us, so we can try to defend ourselves.

        Is it that time of the month for you, Z? This is a real cunt take.
I’ve stated this before in the comments – if you don’t have anything clever to say,don’t say it. Not the first time you’ve made an inane post. Last time was when you disparaged that kid who self-immolated for the Palestinians…a bit ironic considering you don’t have children and one could similarly ignore all of your writing too for the same reasons (you’re a genetic loser).

        Well, let’s see here now, Z. Let’s just suppose that ol’ Assange had managed to find some government mole willing to turn over those locked up FBI files on the Kennedy assassination. And if the information in those files proved conclusively that the FBI was involved, would Assange be considered a bad guy for revealing what the FBI had been desperate to cover up? And what if Assange had been too frightened to reveal the information? Would his cowardice be considered a dereliction of his duty? And what if he took a large amount of money in exchange for silence? Would that make him even more of a reprobate. I see a very complex issue here. If there are no places for bureaucrats to leak, government goons will continue to have a field day. It may be too late anyway. As for leaks about normal people in the private sphere, I agree. Hang them in public.
