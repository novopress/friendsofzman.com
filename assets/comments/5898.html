        “misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world than trickery and malice. At any rate, the last two are certainly much less frequent.” In whose mouth did Goethe put it? That is the key to understand the quote…

        “Violent, tribal societies composed of low-IQ individuals is not the raw material for a liberal democracy.”I would whole-heartedly agree with this, except for one thing. In the Middle Ages the baron or king or whoever made the (mostly local) rules, perhaps largely for his family’s benefit but caring enough that the peasants could get by and provide a reasonable, if cowed, work force. But these lords could do nothing about plagues or famines or even wars where bigger armies marched through, raping and pillaging on their way somewhere else.In other words, in most of human history the powerful could not guarantee many things. They couldn’t even be sure the nature of death when it arrived wouldn’t be painful or horrific.But today there are rich promises, and there are devices and ways to lessen the impact of famine, disease and even nasty neighbours. Thus today’s “lords” can offer goodies and distractions along with glorious and glamorous promises guaranteed to make the low-IQs toe the line. They can be bought into supporting a liberal democracy. Smart phones, free food, cash on demand, housing, health care and more means the peasants will go along with whatever their lords and masters want.What the elite want may not really be any good for the population but hey, they promise free internet as a ‘right’ so make sure you vote often, please.

        Constant wars in the ME are largely due to Islam. Think of Islam as The Borg. It will never stop and seeks to encompass everyone. Sort of like an out of control virus. The West continues to make critical errors in dealing with them because they are ignorant of Islam and its prime directive.In your Theories of Everything, you seem to be saying that you believe that the two competing schools of political thought are not very different from each other. Do you think you might be conflating schools of thought with political parties? I’m of the belief that there’s not much difference between the Dems and Repubs.,they both seek the same thing: greater State control, just to (slightly) different ends. The two primary schools of political thought are conservatism and progressivism. They are night and day. “Official” conservatism, as you called it, is just the flip side of progressive statism. But to me that’s the Establishment, and is why Trump is popular. Many conservatives haven’t given up their conservative values, they’re just not going to vote for any Establishment candidate. Trump is no conservative, but he’s pissed off the Establishment, big-time. Real conservatism is the much needed antidote to progressivism. I wish Trump was a true conservative, but these are spare times in many ways.

            As the Z-Man rightly points out, many wars have been fought in the ME, predating Islam; however, Islam certainly has caused many wars, that’s true. I think Vox Day argued that Islam is responsible for some 3.x percent of all wars, which does not sound like a lot, but is actually more than half the wars caused by religion.From where did Islam emerge? It did not spring from nothing. It’s the violent and clannish nature of the Arab that has shaped Islam. HBD people are very reluctant to accept facts about anything apart from IQ differences, and even here, they cater to Moslems — arguing that the Arab mean IQ of 80 could jump 20 points if only they ate more porridge; ignoring the fact that many are living in Europe, and they aren’t exactly malnourished there, quite the opposite, and they still have lower mean IQs than the European natives. 1st generation Turks in Germany had a mean IQ of 82, 2nd generation Turks were even 3 points lower, at 79.Regarding the violent nature of people from Moslem countries, especially Arabs, there is a paper that has been cited by German anthropologist Andreas Vonderach which shows that 15.6% (sic) of people from Saudi Arabia have the genotype MAOA-2R, which has also been dubbed the warrior gene. Only 0.1% to 0.5% of Europeans have this genotype. That’s the highest amount known so far of any ethnic group. Add to this their greasy and dishonest nature (they are prone to lying), and low mean IQ, you can only have compassion with such a people. I mean, what are they good for? Arabs and Turks are among the least likable people. Many Blacks, at least, have humor. (I think the latter was even argued by Steve Sailer or someone else, partly evidenced by the fact that there are more black comedians than Moslem ones.)Living in Germany, we are importing them en masse now. Pray for us. I don’t know what’s worse: mass immigration of sub-Saharan Africans, or Moslems from the Middle East and North Africa. Either way, we’re getting getting both. To quote Heidegger: Only a God can save us.

        “From the outside, it simply looks like the people in charge, the so-called social justice warriors, are just ignorant busy bodies obsessed with pushing people around. In some cases it appears to be spite that motivates them.”So, penis envy, addressed by The Dog in the Manger.?(Why does everyone ASSUME The Dog in the Manger WASN’T a bitch?)” One defect of the universalist mind is the inability to appreciate the complexity of life.”I propose that the “issue” is their inability to recognize the SIMPLICITY of life, and MUST “invent” complexity of their own language, and “credentials, for comprehension”. Like The Emperor’s New Clothes.But enough about tuition for …um…(ie)”higher education’.Of course, I could be wrong. SOME of us believe we just “get it” (or got it), WITHOUT chronic  corrective “reeducation” reinforcement.Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes an acorn will just happen to fall on your head. …or something.
