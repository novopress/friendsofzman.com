        Look at her tenure at State. Nearly every photo she has a drink and a few she looks blotto. Wonder how she fell down.Probably self medicating to cover her guilt for all the crap she overlooked in the name of blind ambition.

        Really, 300000000 people in the USA and we’re so impoverished of character, integrity and leadership that the best we can do is nominate a drunken second rate hag who has enabled her rapist husband for decades and the third member of a clueless, unprincipled family.

        I think the Bush family, Karl Rove, and the Republican Establishment are reading the wrong tea leaves if they think Jeb has a snowball’s chance in hell at the presidency. If he wasn’t a Bush, he’d be a Democrat. There are no conditions under which I would vote for Jeb Bush. The country doesn’t need or want another Bush or another Clinton, for that matter.
