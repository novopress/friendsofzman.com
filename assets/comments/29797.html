        How anyone thinks Musk is a free spirited businessman and not a state-sponsored actor, I have no idea. He’s here to convince the conservatives their winning again.
Then when they let DeSantis win in 2024, normals will say it’s because “the pendulum swung back” but both these characters might as well be wearing CIA or DoD badges.

        The last segment on Tucker with him eating pizza with the delivery driver who recently stopped a carjacking:

            Our Politburo now has its Pravda.  Not bad George, 1984 – 2024, only around 40 years off. Too bad your warning fell on deaf ears.

        Could Tucker’s firing be an unofficial part of the settlement with Dominion Voting Systems?
I’d suspect that it is.

        Strangely enough… the Tribe somehow managed to be at the center of the Tucker defenestration!
Oy vey, I never woulda guessed!
“Abby Grossberg, who has worked in TV news for two decades, sued Fox, Fox News, Tucker Carlson and several producers late Monday, alleging the network is rife with sexist, misogynistic and abusive behavior.
Grossberg’s lawsuit alleges discrimination based on gender, religion and disability. She alleges that “constant bullying and gaslighting” caused her “so much stress and anxiety that her stomach ulcers flared up and she was in excruciating pain.”

        So a few days ago, several posters on here said we need a high profile martyr. Tucker was referenced. I said that nothing will come long-term of any martyr for our cause. I suppose we shall see, but my money says that absolutely nothing will come of this.

                But no one significant at Bud has or will suffer. The libs always eat their own peons. But this in no way will change anything. The stock will quickly rebound if it has not already and time will march on. They emblazoned the front of their beer with a degenerate sodomite and one or two frat people managers were reassigned. Seems like the progs won, not us.

                    I saw a part of the interview with the xirl-exec (who may actually have been a dude xirself) and thought the thinking was pretty solid in a totally cynical and soulless corporate way actually.  Before you flame me, allow me to post my translation of xer justification:See, Bud light is complete shit. I mean, we make it from antifreeze and that stuff they used to flare off at refineries. I don’t even know how our customers survive drinking it. Also the brand has been failing for years. We think we might have just killed too many of the older drinkers. So, one day we all took a bunch of bath salts and one of us said – let’s make a commercial for it with some well known trannnie! We’ll get all the trannie freaks to drink it to spite the inevitable right wing backlash. After it kills them off too we declare the brand over and done with but get one final cash-in before the end. We still have all that other shit we make and we can still tell the rednecks that those brands are still down with NASCAR, Murrica, guns, God, and guts ‘n shit.

            This sort of martyrdom is meaningless. Dominion voting machines. Yawn. Now if Carlson had gone down in flames after a fire-breathing presentation denouncing Hutu stupidity and violence, and extolling the virtues of race realism and white separatism, it might have been different.

            Lol was just thinking about that. Came here to see if anybody mentioned it.
I very strongly said Tucker should not go all out, and be careful so that he doesn’t get fired.

        I have to say that the news that Tucker got canned hit me like a gut punch despite the fact that it was an ever present possibility.  He delivered a lot of important information to which the normie conservative Fox News viewer would otherwise never have been exposed.  Regardless of where he lands, his voice will be severely throttled in comparison to appearing on Fox News five nights a week.  His show was literally the only thing worth watching on regular television.  His demise is an ominous sign for the viability of dissident politics.

            viability of dissident politics.—That would seem to be self-contradictory, though I’m somewhat more rosy on this as it still serves to invalidate the regime.  While Tucker was on normie could somewhat hold on to the idea that “at least the media, a small part of it, is trying”.

            It was the J6 footage coverage.
That was supposed to be a week long expose.
Huge splash night one. A murmur on night two. Then it disappeared.
Tucker interviewed recently saying that he only recently realized that “the press” is nothing more than a government allowed safety valve. That he was embarrassed at his full throated endorsement of government war propaganda in Iraq.
I think he was a loose cannon and ready to quit anyway. He’ll be fine.
(Thanks to mandatory cable fees, FauxNews will be too)

        People complaining about their blue checkmark status betray their lack of status in the regime. It’s a handy guide in that sense.

        Over on YT there are constant discussions about Star Wars, Kathleen Kennedy (the exec in charge of Lucasfilm at Disney) and the destruction of beloved male heroes like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in favor of some fanfic girl boss. Toy companies are in revolt as girls are not buying Star Wars girl boss toys and and the old market of dads buying stuff for their sons is dried up precipitously. The dudes discussing it are mostly White dudes wearing ball caps; obviously for all the Hollywood nonsense around Star Wars the original movies touched these guys emotions which is why they are so upset about it.[Particularly as people are more isolated and atomized by consumerism and mass media society, something really changed in Western Societies around 1850 or so as industrialization, mass literacy, newspaper serials, and much more affordable mass produced goods started severing social bonds and destroying intermediating organizations like charities, social clubs, the like in favor of the daily newspaper. These stories mattered a lot more in 1977 than they did in 1707, for example. A White dude working at a cubicle farm might not have many close male friends, but Han Solo and Luke Skywalker could provide the model of what might be possible, and this mattered to motivate and inspire White guys absent real personal connections.]What they don’t understand (they have faith in the marketplace) is that public morality shapes the stories told. White women managers have been told since the 1970s at least that White men are evil, stupid, and bad. Thus there always be now given that White professional women dominate Hollywood like every other corporate entity, the story of the stupid White male figure supplanted by the girl boss.The corollary to this is that White men have no emotional or moral ties to the current society. It tells them they are evil, stupid and bad. Destroys their legacy heroes, tells them to worship the Girl Boss and eat the bugs like Renfield. Someone somewhere will fill that vacuum. Meanwhile the girl bosses, vibrant and diverse “immigrants” and vibrant kangz have so far proven unable to remove Russia and China from the playing field; the Chinese Ambassador to the EU noted that former Soviet Republics like Latvia are “not real countries” in a move that was obviously scripted.Faster than I figured possible, a lot of middle aged White guys are finding themselves not only edged out of the system by diverse and girl boss rivals, but emotionally exiled from society which simply has no place for them.

            If the Chinese and Russians take out the shitheads in the dc and acela corridor mafia, don’t care what color or hole they stick it in, the better all real Americans will be. The MBA is a marker of a scumbag. Produces nothing but the art of manipulation. All companies who have mbas or marketers like that awfl bud light bitch should be cast aside. Localism and than picking up the pieces and scattering the acela corridor, mba and hollywood shitstains should the be the next goal.

            Also, if you want to blame anyone for that bitch Kennedy, blame her former true boss, Lucas. That asshole gave her full reigns after he hung his hat after the terrible prequels. How that guy couldn’t see what was in front of him all along is truly baffling.

                Lucas?  Seems obvious.  America is a nation full of cucked men like George, submissive to female authority while thinking himself a generous, bold, and forward-thinking patron.  George has at least two daughters.  Almost all men who have daughters become instant feminists, however much they’d deny it.  George Lucas is no exception.American men imagine to themselves that handing the nation over to their daughters, and to the daughters of other men, marks them as strong and powerful.  In reality they’re just manlings, cowards with money who are fine seeing the nation burn as long as his Princesses always win and get everything.  Because nothing is too good for Muh Princess!It’s a mistake to think that because George Lucas wrote stories about heroes, that he is a hero.  Luke and Han are the men Georgie WISHES he could be . . . but ain’t, and never will be.  Not that I would cite either Luke or Han as masculine models.  Even the original flicks seem cucked to me.Once again illustrating that in many Western nations, the deity obeyed and served by men is not the God of Melchizedek and Abraham, but instead is Woman.  God isn’t really in them, so they easily replaced Him with Woman.Folks alive in the Fifties and Sixties were in on the ground-floor to witness the advocacy and rise of our neo-pagan, updated version of the goddess cults and religions.  They never went anywhere, just  festered underground for a bit.

        All content ultimately must be paid for—by somebody. Just like anything else that has been socialized, it may not be paid for by the end user, but it is paid for by the aggregate. There is no free lunch. This is what allows bad content to be subsidized and messages to be controlled.The great advantage in paying for it out-of-pocket consists in the fact that it opens up market forces, which eliminates the bad content and the control by middlemen. I am in favor of this. The best way to take back control of the message from the MSM is to start paying for it ourselves.There is a downside to this. Aggregation smooths out the transaction process and allows aggregators to offer more content at a cheaper rate, due to basic economies of scale. It is basically what newswires and TV networks have always done. If we pay for our news “on the spot market,” so to speak, it will be much more expensive. We will get less quantity but hopefully better quality.Expense aside, paying for our own content is anecessary political actthat  is required to defeat the Blue Cheka. Just like the process of getting out of debt which I’ve also mentioned, this is how individuals start to take back control of their lives and defeat the blob. This is the way to take on all the “establishments” that oppress us—financial, educational, and media.

            Back in the mid-ought’s, I had a paramour who was on the outs with her B.F. The B.F. had been offered a job as one of the first dozen or so employees at a West Coast tech startup, and girl, well, she didn’t want to leave NYC..In time, my friend filled me in (pillow talk) on the startup and its “plan.”
“Twitter?” said I,  “That’s a stupid name, and a absolutely idiotic business model. He’ll be back in six months. Mark my words…”

        The internet needs us more than we need it. As I contemplate the Tree of Woe that our culture has become, I move  inexorably to the point at which I will walk away and only buy local. Even this comment seems like an Alanis-level act of ironic futility: Ouroboros eating its own tail.

            But it IS free.Not only is it free, for current events, politics and punditry… the free content is superior in quality to that offered by the old mainstream media. It warms the cold, dead cockles of my heart to see that the fags at The Glob &amp; Snail (The Globe and Mail for our Yank friends) – can’t sell a subscription for 99 cents! 😂👍 Learn to code, you finks!HAR HAR HAR!It is my pleasure to watch them die too! Think I read somewhere that Buzzfeed just died and went to hell! We now live in an age where only the top 1% of “content creators” can actually sell content. While this is bad news for our esteemed blog host…for the rest of us…this is a good thing.I hear that Tucker Carlson just got the punt at Fox. It will be interesting to see if he can make the change and survive in the New World. He now faces some very stiff competition. The fact is that it can be now argued that it would be a GOOD thing if the old jew media burned to the ground en masse. The best of them might be able to continue to sell content… but the vast majority of Rebecca’s and Sara’s will end up on a mop or cash register at Walmart where they belong…😊👍

                Way back in the before times, they used to say that the dirty secret of journalism was that the sports page sold the paper. Not many were really interested in paying for the news section.It’s also true that TDS drove a surge in NYT subscribers. But this phenomenon didn’t happen at papers nation or worldwide, it was pretty specific to just a couple of publications.But for the time being, the regime (to include the MICOM, Big Pharma et al) can prop up whichever media they want to prop up. If you were wondering why Raytheon advertises on Fox News, as if their viewers could buy any of its products.

                    Correct.  It doesn’t matter if the news business is unprofitable.  It is a loss leader for the regime.  They (Bezos, big pharma, MIC, the gov’t alphabet agencies, etc.) will cover all losses to maintain the narrative

                    If anyone were actually doing serious research on, well anything, anymore, it might be an interesting PhD dissertation to rigorously dissect popular brands and media to determine exactly *what* is providing the cash to support the FnG components of a given product line.We all have this sense about the things like your example of the sports page but has anyone really looked into this? I’d be interested especially in some psychoanalysis of the thinking of the executives who allow and facilitate this. Why DOES so much of pop culture look like a giant cocaine party thrown for the benefit of talentless whores and monkeys using the profits raked in from a small sector of high-achievers? More importantly, how can we all act in such a way as to hasten the moment when the cops kick in the door and drag the partygoers off to the gaol?

        Somewhat related, Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News, reportedly as part of the Dominion Settlement. So there is that.The bet the blue checks make is that relentless propaganda can and will create the reality: you will accept the new Bud Light Mascot as a woman, you will love girl bosses as your heroes replacing tiresome “pale, stale, and male” White men. You will love diversity, eat the bugs, live in the pod. Die for the current thing.All this does is undermine the legitimacy and the respect of the system, state, government, and its managerial class by White men. The managers are left with only force, which being female mostly they have lusted after like Hillary Clinton over a new mu-mu. Force has its uses, to be sure, but it is less effective when used to maintain highly complex systems that require force be used against those maintaining it.

            Yep. Proof positive that FOX was always “allowed” to operate as controlled opposition. When they started getting out of their lane and hitting a bit too close to the bone, they got bitch-slapped back into place.
The Tucker defenestration is part and parcel of the Ricky Vaughn prosecution, the Trump prosecution, the Charlottesville torch prosecution, and the Alex Jones civil case.
The Regime is going to control the Narrative one way or the other, and if they cannot manufacture criminal charges, they will sue their enemies into bankruptcy and/or compliance in the civil courts.

He was the only remaining voice in the MSM that was trying to point out any truths to the people.

                The thing about Tucker that made the ADL shriek and point the loudest was several months ago when he pointed out that American citizens were being replaced.  I don’t even think he said “white.”  But replacement of Americans mentioned was an “over-the-target” moment, and I suppose Tucker’s days were numbered because of that.

                    He took the respectable conservative position—because it’s a thing Democrats themselves say—that Democrats are importing voters.The ADL isn’t run by idiots. They presume, nearly correctly, that nobody truly believes in *that version* of “replacement.” It’s too stupid. So Tucker’s real position, the one to which he leads his audience by never saying it, would be something more like “Jews are destroying the West to avenge the effrontery of rescuing them from Hitler, and we should stop them, soon.”We know Tucker’s not that kind of guy. They don’t. They’re smart but they don’t have a “theory of mind”—”chutzpah” is this lack—so everyone who’s not them is the same Nazi.

            The weaponization of the courts.  The NYT can print blatant lies while Fox was in danger of a billion plus award.  So Fox settled and made Tucker the martyr.
I wonder what he is going to do. I don’t think he will retire. He’s too driven to retire at 53 or 54. But cable news is out of the question.  Maybe his own pay to view website.

                The obvious move is to increase focus on his independent efforts.
Less obvious but still logical would be joining forces with Bannon.
I don’t see him as a good fit with any of the other big alt podcasters like Dore, Redacted, The Duran, Valuetainment, etc.

                Look, I get it. The downvotes are fans of ole Tuck there. That’s fine, I salute your loyalty.What I do not share a tip of the hat with is your discernment, as IMO it is lacking. Also signaled by your downvotes.I attended Trump rallies. Wanted a knight, on a white horse. Truly, I did. But sadly, received this gift of discernment, so its nagging voice reminds me that me and mine are not better off. Yes, Solzhenitsyn says to not ‘live the lie’ and I feel I do not. But Tucker and Don have their children set up for life, into future generations.Me and mine? All this ‘knowing’ and fifty cents might get you a ride on the NYC subway. If that.

            Holy smoke! He was their top-rated show by far.  Of course their largest shareholders (Blackrock, Vanguard, etc.,) are a “who’s who” of those pushing the “Environmental, Social and Governance” (ESG) and “Corporate Equality Index” (CEI) agendas on corporations. Carlson being a white, heterosexual Christian with a wife and four kids probably knocked down their social credit score.

            The regime is making it understood that companies are no longer allowed to promote any sort of dissent.  Ironically, despite the constant screaming from the regime about fascists, what we’re observing is the establishment of economic fascism as it was originally understood:  The “partnership” of business and government to suppress the population, in practice the government threatens corporations and the corporations rapidly fall in line.The trick they seem to be using to legitimize this stuff is having control of the courts and encouraging civil suits over what used to be protected by the bill of rights.  If the target tries to fight the suit they get nailed for an infinity dollar judgment.  They already used this to grind Alex Jones into the dirt, doing it to a mainstream news outlet that was already 90% regime propaganda is just them getting brazen about it.The best part is the creatures engaging in this sort of behavior genuinely believe themselves to be saving democracy from evil as they wipe their filth encrusted sphincters back to front with the constitution.

        I was donating to someone who is at the center of one of the important issues and, “debates”, of our time. Though debate isn’t correct since things are settled and the Hive is putting in place their project. If you seek to introduce debate, well there are words for you and you are silenced.In any case, that gave me access to inside discussions with other supporters. It seemed and still seems to me, that debate and persuasion is useless. A highly organized set of financial interests have control of a highly religious set of believers. By hook or by crook they are going to implement their project. At one of the discussions, I asked the question – what do we do if we can’t use persuasion to stop this project that will impoverish billions and send humanity back to the stone ages?There were gasps of outrage at even taking into consideration that persuasion might not work and that if this task has such a moral imperative perhaps other alternatives need to be looked at. It was merely a question, and a fair one at that.We have a lot of people who are making a living in the realm of persuasion that likely only amounts to pissing in the wind. Then there is a huge layer of pundits who make their living showing you the outrage who make a lot of money and call that fighting back. In reality, the usurpers are deeply entrenched and they are digging in deeper and in greater numbers. They can’t be persuaded any differently than what they already have been persuaded to believe. Moreover, trying to be persuasive only alerts them to you and, as we see, they use our money to end your ability to be persuasive.The final two paragraphs of this post are incredible. I hope the billionaire class is reading this post. If you don’t step up to the plate and mimic the billionaire shit-poster, whose empire is largely dependent on government largesse, then the words of Guillaume Faye are ones you should heed:“If it is to survive, our folk – whether in Toulouse, Rennes, Milan, Prague, Munich, Antwerp or Moscow – must revert to and embrace ancestral virility. Otherwise, as is already happening, we shall be submerged by more vital, more youthful, and less well-meaning peoples with the complicity of a delinquent bourgeoisie that – whatever it may do – will itself be swept away by the tide that it has so heedlessly caused.”

        Didn’t know much about this dust-up but am well-informed now.  Good leadership showing a potential way forward.  IOW retain positive and aggressive perspective — make it hard, never give anything away and make the lying little monsters fight and bleed for every inch of turf.  Losing ain’t a shame, not fighting is a shame.Agree the Spiteful Mutant Oppressed are deeply entrenched everywhere, including U.S. intel.  However, like the Glenn Close character in Dangerous Liaisons, the Woke-Fem Politburo fears social shame and loss of standing/privilege greater even than death.  Reasons being, most have never experienced real hardship, and the majority are female.Indeed, it is a Beautiful Thing to hear the former blue checks ‘howling in agony’ at loss of their demon-inspired Privilege.  Like a glimmer of heaven come to Earth aforetime, to torment the King’s enemies.

        The problem with paying for content or to use platforms is that most of it isn’t worth paying for.  Twitter is a perfect example of this.  There is nothing about Twitter which could entice me to pay to use it.  The same is true of all the news sites.  They want me to them to propagandize and lie to me? Good luck with that.
Most social media platforms would go bankrupt if they had to rely on people paying a fee to use them.

                There is a reason none of the social media companies have introduced a “pay to use” model.  The ecosystem is what gives them the value they have, whatever that value may be.  But that ecosystem would likely collapse by 80% or more if you had to pay to use it.Advertisers would abandon the platform or at least offer a lot less money for ads.I think youtube could probably pull it off. They have the highest costs, but they also offer content worth viewing. A lot of legacy TV is on it.  There are endless how-to videos, which people would pay for.

        I have never used social media. I find Twitter’s format confusing and unenjoyable, and I don’t even read anything there let alone make use of the platform. These modern rage-wars over social media happenings are more important for what they signify in themselves rather than whatever the hubbub is about.If you’re on Twitter, you belong to “The West.” You are inwardly a member of Western Civilization and you are yoked to its fate. The Twitter Wars are what remains of significant Western cultural activity.If you are not on Twitter, you belong to “the rest.” You run the risk of being trampled by a clash between titans that you don’t understand and don’t care about, but you have a chance to form part of the seed corn of a future nation.I’m taking my chances with “the rest” and I no longer concern myself with the future of Western Civ.

        I’m not sure if democratizing the blue check mark is a good thing or not — it’s certainly pissed off a lot of higher status shitlibs though, which I enjoy.The problem that Musk faces is a really big one: Twitter remains completely infested with shitlib FBI and CIA agents, just like the rest of the tech companies, and their primary goal is destroying (white) middle class populism.  See here:https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11562433/Facebook-riddled-ex-CIA-agents-ex-FBI-agents-work-Twitter.htmlAnd Musk can’t fire them, because the RESTRICT Act is hanging there like a sword of Damocles in Congress to essentially nationalize Twitter if he makes a move against these agents (the RESTRICT Act is ostensibly against Tiktok, but its real target is Twitter).  Of course, the media won’t tell you why that Act is there in congress, but that’s the reason.Censorship has gone *up* under Musk:https://nypost.com/2023/04/01/twitter-censorship-increases-under-elon-musk-leadership-study/(including against me, where I ate a 12 hour suspension followed by a 5 day search suggestion and reply deboosting shadowban for no apparent reason).I don’t suspect things will change here.  Musk’s twitter profile photo is himself in a satanic bahomet costume (so he’s telling you exactly what he believes), and his views are all standard WEF views:?ssl=1Also see: “This isn’t that hard. Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom of reach.” – Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL 4-5-22 , followed by “New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.” -Elon Musk 11-18-22 .  Followed by 4-17-23 Twitter’s new censorship policies announced: “Freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.”Twitter seems like a complete dumpster fire and Musk really rose to the Peter principle by purchasing it.  Alternatively, I’m enjoying Substack so far, although I suspect it will eventually get eaten up by a tech behemoth and the censorship also turned to 10/10 (the strategy of all these tech companies is to have limited or no content moderation as they expand in order to maximize user growth, then either get compromised by globohomo or sell out to a globohomo behemoth and the free speech is destroyed).

        “This barbarian has entered the temple and stripped them of their status.”
It reminds me of Moses in ‘The Ten Commandments’, breaking open the temple granary to feed the slaves.  When the outraged priests complain that the grain is the property of the gods, he tartly replies “What the gods can digest will not sour in the belly of a slave.”

        Like many here I suppose, I have never used Twitter, don’t really know what it is or how it works, have no familiarity with the medium, its jargon or the crazies that inhabit that space. The only exposure to it that I get occurs via posts like this, and I always feel like I need to take a shower after these episodes of impromptu exposure.Habits of mind can be changed, but it’s not easy. It takes prolonged repetition of a particular mental stimulus (message or meme) over many weeks or months; and often must be accompanied by some form of reward (positive reinforcement) or penalty (negative reinforcement). The Twitter Blue checkmark appears to be an industrial version of this technique – altering minds among the sheeple via an insidious repetition (echo chamber effect) of followers and likes that reinforce a particular mental state on a mass scale. This is how you can control elections in the dark and ensure that only the stupid and corrupt get into office and positions of governmental power. And he who controls the medium, controls the indoctrination.What fixes this problem/vulnerability? Well, you are unlikely to spend several hours a day on Twitter if you haven’t eaten in 3 days.

            Drudge was running a story this morning saying Musk has already cucked and reinstated a lot of the blue checks.
For all the kvetching about blue checks by the beautiful people, they all want to pretend it wasn’t them who went after the blue check marks first.  They want to forget this was their first attack against Milo.  AFAIK, Milo was the first victim of the blue check morality show.
Twitter is too expensive even when it’s free. I cannot imagine Twitter could sustain itself with paid accounts unless there are some serious changes to the platform.

                It has been the assertion of Sundance from Conservative Tree House that Twitter’s expenses were largely being defrayed by the Deep State. He called it Jack’s Magic Coffee Shop, if I recall correctly. Makes sense if the servers in the Deep State’s data centers were the technical backbone of their operations, and that this would simplify Their surveillance of all comers. Boy, that’d cut costs, wouldn’t it?

            I never understood that.  The local rag complained for years that non-subscribers dominated their comments and to me the solution seemed obvious (even though I was one of the non-subscribers), but instead they crippled the comments which were the only reason a lot of people even went to their site.

                A free market allows different strokes for different folks. I’m fine with a plethora of different fee structures. I set a budget based on what I used to pay for all the print subscriptions  and work off that. There are some morons who I’d gladly slip a few bucks to but they only accept Paypal or Patreon, neither of which I now use.C’est La Vie.

        Prior to the advent of social media, one could limit, relatively speaking, their contact with the spiteful mutant class – maybe a leftish-tard friend, co-worker or box wine aunt.  Perhaps a feminist protest over “their body, their choice” kind of crap.  I had a decent amount of exasperation to enmity for those people, depending.  Now that all those F-tards can spout their bullshit non-stop with basically no restrictions, in everyone’s face 24/7/365, my enmity knows no bounds.  I don’t even care if they truly believe their bs, the fact that they’re mouthing/writing it means they’re gonna get dealt with behind the woodshed or eventually out front, good and hard.

        OT, but to the general issue of Wokeism. I was musing on a post here a few days ago about the Woke religion. I realized there is a somewhat similar trend from way across the world: footbinding in China.Always the poorer try to emulate the richer (I am thinking particularly of the Victorian middle class). But footbinding was unique. It started as an emperor’s fetish and gradually drifted down, but what was unique is its self-destructive aspects. In short, for the poor people, they needed all the field help they could get. But, they would cripple their daughters, making their own lives significantly harder as a result of the loss of labor, in order to conform to the ideals of the overlords.I dunno. I am sure many could argue that other whims fit into a similar cluster of self-destructive behavior. But when I see those people kissing feet and sacrificing their kids at the alter of diversity, it strikes me as an even more egregious footbinding.

            An anecdote from a missionary to pre-revolutionary China always struck me. He would be surrounded by hostile villagers and just stare at the women’s feet and it would discombobulate and shame them enough to lessen the threat of violent assault. In-groups beliefs and customs, no matter how insane and counter-productive, are powerful signifiers.

            In the case of a Western parent/guardian, support of trannyism more resembles that parent/guardian tossing the child into the fiery furnace of Moloch. Ain’t no coming back from that if carried to its extremity.

        Musk has bestowed the holy blue check on a few of his haters including Stephen King, Charlie Sheen etc.   Maybe he thinks he owns them by doing that or some 4d move, I don’t know. It’s all so lame.

            I think it’s his way of pwning them.
I loved it when he labeled NPR and the CBC as “state-run media”. That got bigger howls than the blue-check thing. But then he stopped it. So Musk has balls but only sometimes. I call it “capricious testicularity”.

        Musk was originally very clumsy with the Blue check stuff, where at first it looked like people were just paying 8 dollars a month to be a part of the cool people’s club, which caused nothing but mockery and derision. The change to simply being a premium service has fixed a lot of that, and it’s a testament to his backbone he followed through.The funny part is the press cartel’s unwillingness to pay a measily 8 bucks a month is going to damage their brand long-term far more than being stubborn and allowing a million parody accounts to undermine them. Heck, they could have probably made a backroom deal with Twitter where they could become a super-check for a few grand a year or something, but the idea that a multimillion dollar company has to pay for special privileges is beneath them for some reason.After all, the good guys shouldn’t have to pay to be the good guys.

            I think the $8/month complaints are more about the fact that previous blue checks are forced to acknowledge that all of their influence (considerable) and most of their “followers” and engagement were completely by design as a tool of the state.  It was all fake, all the way down.No, you weren’t a special little snowflake.  Yes, your status was generated because of your ability to be in the top 1% of obsequious rumpswabbery via regime talking points distribution.If Elon went and “tweaked the algo” to artificially boost engagement for the screaming “I won’t pay for a blue check” for a year, they’d all settle down real quick.  They imagine themselves as Lords of the Universe.Then he could snap his finger and reveal the scam (again) next April 1st.The meltdown has been glorious to watch.  The blue checks and thought leaders have been revealed as a cult of mean girls and nothing more.  The “original blue check” should be a mark of shame and embarrassment; pretty sure they’ll never figure that out.

        “(T)his strikes normal people as completely nuts, which is why normal people struggle to accept that these people really do believe this stuff.”
It is nuts and it is a struggle to believe the response is real. Once you acknowledge both as true, it also means you accept how dangerous these people are and how precarious society currently is. These types have slaughtered millions before and will again if the opportunity presents.

                Long term, there is only one pertinent question.
Who is birthing more offspring: the lunatics, or the sane?
My gut instinct is that the lunatics likely will not breed at anywhere close to replacement levels, but that they will continue throwing infantile temper tantrums [DADDY YOU WILL PAY ATTENTION TO ME!!!] until well after menopause [unless the V@xxines have already eradicated the lunatics prior to menopause].
I don’t sense that Mother Nature tolerates this sort of nonsense for very long.
And Father Time simply rolls his eyes and shakes his dadgum head.

                    Nonsense. It matters not a whit if lunatics breed their own or not, since there is an endless pool of normal children to groom, convert, subvert and indoctrinate into their lunacy.History is chock full of examples of a minority, with the organization and will, dominating a majority population.That is the point of the Twitter War. A minority of people use Twitter, and a minority of Twitter users are spiteful mutants, but that minority has used Twitter to dominate the culture and is terrified of losing control of that tool.

                        Exactly. The referenced Bolsheviks had very little popular support but tremendous financial resources and extensive organization and training. The upside if that cuts either way, of course, but only the extreme Left and its lunatic foot soldiers now have the money and organization.Laugh as we do at the troons, for example, they are fantastic foot soldiers precisely because they are so disgusting and expendable. For example, the Nashville terrorist was a member of the JOHN BROWN GUN CLUB. Her death to those who created and used her was very low cost with high opportunity possibilities. It is a good guess her manifesto has not been released because of possible connections.

                THE CHEKIST is an excellent film.Of all the things that terrified me about the response to Covid, the prevalence of snitches, spies and informants stood out. Obviously that was benign compared to post-civil war Russia, but it showed the ground has been prepared for a similar network of State terror enablers.My favorite author of the Cold War, Robert Littell, offered in THE REVOLUTIONIST: A NOVEL OF RUSSIA quite a bit of insight into the sociopathy that plagued much of 1924 Russia. It is among my least favorite novels he penned because it is too long and ponderous, but it is meticulously researched and very insightful about the transition from idealism into cruelty and sadism believed to be in pursuit of an honorable cause. It really complements THE CHEKIST.Similar types are now in place in the event a catastrophic war loss or economic collapse rocks the United States, either of which have become possible. When people tout accelerationism, they need to appreciate how far advanced and bloodthirsty the enemy is. We laugh at these gestating monsters at our peril.

                        The worst and most dangerous elements of the Left are buying firearms and ammunition at a rapid pace, too. The Nashville tranny terrorist, for example, was a member of the JOHN BROWN GUN CLUB. Some have documented extensive firearms training among Antifa.
It is good to have shooting skills and be prepared for the worst, but we hardly the only ones who believe this.

                    Let’s not forget the East German Stasi informants.
About 1 in 7 East Germans would spy on their neighbors, fabricating charges for things like spite, personal feuds, better housing, job promotions, etc.   but ultimately it was about status…what drives every human.
“ Informants were made to feel important, given material or social incentives, and were imbued with a sense of adventure, and only around 7.7%, according to official figures, were coerced into cooperating”
Do t tell me it can’t happen here: it already is.

                    I saw THE Checkist long ago too. it is the most frightening movie ever made. showing the sadistic homicidal bloodlust that can be ginned up with self righteous propaganda . it also will remove from your eyes any “they don’t really mean all that crazy stuff” thinking .  the sadistic butchers in that movie were clearly completely without reason , compassion or mercy . young men gunning down priests and the most beautiful young women they had probably ever seen . all the while whistling while they worked .   it should be mandatory viewing  .

        In a world where everyone is “special” , no one is. People’s inflated opinions of themselves is so base &amp; childish.
Stop the world, I want to get off.

        I think it is a little more primordial than that.The blue check mark has became a marker of social status on twitter.Removing it is a downgrade in social status.  Doing it en masse is an upending of the social order of the twitterverse.The people that sought out the blue check mark were publicity whores – broken people that craved attention and the social signal that came with it.So for them – the upending of the social order in the twitterverse is an apocalypse that threatens their sense of identity and self importance.If i were on twitter, I’d troll the f—-kers relentlessly for getting the communism they’ve advocated good and hard.
