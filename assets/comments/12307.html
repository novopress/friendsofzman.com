        #Nevertrump‚Äôs hallmark is shameless lying, but I despise the goy members far more than the Kristols/Podhoretzs. These neocon jews are deeply focused on advancing their ethnic interests.  French, Sloppy Williamson, McMuffin et al are traitors. Period.If you have the opportunity to communicate with any of them via twitter, email, etc ‚Äì call them a traitor. Point blank. Do not make credible threats, but let them know that they are likely to face judgement for their treason.  Ryan, McCain, Graham should also be waking up at 3am with nagging fears.These people despise us in exchange for shekels. Despise them at least as much.

        The GOP leadership has basically backed itself over a cliff in this race.  If Moore does lose tomorrow, the GOP will not have saved itself anything at all, and you will see it in full display during the coming year as every Republican running will be hit with the same 20-40 year old charges, and what is the leadership going to say at that point?  Having torpedoed Moore, how can they argue against future ones with any chance of being listened to?

            I can pretty much predict at this point that if Moore loses, the GOP will default back to ‚ÄúWell, if we only had more votes in the Senate, we could keep our promises.‚Äù
If Moore wins‚Ä¶duck‚Ä¶because they‚Äôve gone full-on character assassination with him, and he doesn‚Äôt strike me as the kind of guy who is going to get to D.C. with a ‚Äúforgive and forget‚Äù attitude about it.

                I think if Moore loses, the GOP uses it to go after Bannon. They will try to get Trump to denounce Bannon and the populist insurgents. This tactic largely worked against the Tea Party after 2010 when Christine O‚ÄôDonnell was made into the face of the Tea Party.Now, if Moore wins, things get complicated for the GOP. They really don‚Äôt want a primary fight with their base, but Bannon is determined to bring the fight to them. They may just lock arms with the Democrats and forget about the whole #MeToo thing and pretend it never happened. Franken will stay in his seat and that will be the end of it.

                    The GOP is already going after Bannon.  All the usual suspects are saying he hasn‚Äôt any money, can‚Äôt really produce a winner, etc‚Ä¶.targeting his fundraisers.  If he loses, they‚Äôll be vindicated.  If he wins, they‚Äôll say Bannon is over-rated, and it really was local issues and stupid rednecks not Bannon, and gosh what a disaster that the GOP had defend a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù seat‚Ä¶‚Ä¶from its own voters, no less.If Moore wins, Katy bar the door.  That‚Äôs why the eGOP has gone just batshit crazy trying to beat Moore.  They‚Äôve bet it all on trying to beat him.  The problem of course with betting it all is the prospect of losing it all.  It shows you how far they‚Äôve fallen that there haven‚Äôt really been the usual face-saving caveats at the end.Hence the Fox poll showing Jones at +10.  They had to try something to push Moore‚Äôs polling average down, make it look competitive.  The RCP average has him winning pretty handily.

                        At some point this arrangement will have to end. Either a new party forms and the Republicans split between that and the Democrats or a coup happens and all the toads running the Republicans get ejected.

                            I think we‚Äôll see a new party bust out of the GOP in the next 10 years.  It‚Äôs incredibly tough to start a 3rd party because the Dems and GOP have rigged the state elections to the point that 3rd party candidates have a huge uphill battle.It‚Äôs going to take 20-25 Senators to decide to caucus separately from the GOP and Dems, and the House Freedom Caucus would have to do the same.  Since neither side would have a majority, it would give them a huge amount of leverage over who gets to be the Speaker of the House.More importantly, though, is that as fun as it is to talk about a 3rd party, defining it, what it stands for, and how it would actually enforce adherence (i.e. prevent it from being co-opted by the GOP/Dems) is the tough spot.  There is definitely a place (Trump proves this) for an American-first party that is for low levels of immigration, pro-American trade policies, and an overwhelmingly strong national defense.That would have to come at the cost of those ‚ÄúConstitutional Conservatives‚Äù who don‚Äôt seem to conserve very much, the low tax Republicans, who have accepted the Liberal line that tax rates must be ‚Äúpaid for‚Äù, and Social Conservatives who are increasingly buying into the SJW arguments.It can be done, but it‚Äôs gonna be a small party, and the Dems and GOP are going to UNLOAD on it with everything they‚Äôve got.

        What I find most infuriating about French, Hewitt, and so many others in that particular vein with regard to the Moore story in particular is how willing they appear to be snowed.  Moore has been a public figure for decades; he‚Äôs been the topic of stories covered nationwide on several occasions in the last 20 years.  If French and Hewitt had any brains at all, their bullshit detectors should be flitting into the red simply because none of these stories had surfaced between 1977 and now, yet they caterwaul about ‚Äúchild molestation‚Äù and how the yearbook ‚Äúevidence‚Äù was ‚Äúoverwhelming,‚Äù despite ‚Äî as I was sure it would ‚Äî the fact that it turned out to be fraudulent.Again and again and again:  With friends like these‚Ä¶.

            That‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs a hit job, and not legit.  Trump, similarly, has been in the public eye for decades.

        Immigration has become my single issue. Either I can have locks on my door, call one place home, and rest easily, or I have no home and no right to peace or even the most fundamental, minimal right of citizenship. I get why Obama as a ‚Äúworld citizen‚Äù didn‚Äôt like borders; he was a guy without a home, a kid raised by a single mother who gave birth to him to prove a point to the white world rather than out of love. His black dad abandoned him and he bounced from Hawaii to Indonesia to life as an alienated barely-black weirdo living in dorms in colleges he didn‚Äôt earn entry into. He has no home and wouldn‚Äôt understand the concept, so I don‚Äôt really hold it against him. I do hold it against people who should know better.As for abortion, I‚Äôm for people I don‚Äôt like having abortions, and people I do like reproducing. ‚ÄúNever interrupt your enemy when he‚Äôs making a mistake,‚Äù is a quote attributed to Napoleon, but someone needs to tell it to the fundamentalist Christians trying to stop our demographic enemies from doing us a favor when they go to the clinic. Barring mandatory Norplant for welfare recipients (as per Representative David Duke) Margaret Sanger‚Äôs weed-whacker should be applied to weeds, and discouraged from cutting down flowers that give the garden aesthetic appeal. Or, as Ed Asner said, ‚ÄúNot only do I support abortion. Sometimes I look around and see some misses opportunities.‚Äù

            Same reason Trump won ‚Äì he wasn‚Äôt talking at or down to the voters ‚Äì he talked TO them. Only one talking to AL voters is Moore. I actually haven‚Äôt heard Jones talking to anyone at all, let alone the people who will be voting today. You‚Äôd think maybe they could use their massive national propaganda organs to give Jones a voice? They seem more interested in hating Moore though for some strange reason. They love to hate him. They get off on it.

        The most deliciously ironic and amusing thing about this, is that National Review is supposed to be stuck in the Conservative 80s. Well, now they‚Äôve got a conservative candidate that‚Äôs also stuck ‚Äì in the 80s. You‚Äôd think rationally, they‚Äôd be overjoyed at this prospect, but the absolute opposite is happening.Basically at this point, they stand for nothing, not even the past. And anyone who takes them seriously still at this point is also in this no-man‚Äôs-land that they‚Äôve put themselves into. I guess like a lot of already dead institutions, it‚Äôll take a while for them to rot to the point where they disappear, but rot they will and disappear they must.

        French is attempting a clever tactic to help bring about Moore‚Äôs defeat. His tools are deception and misdirection, and his intention is to prey upon the weak within the Alabama electorate. Is this the kind of man you ever would want to befriend or do business with? Men like this should be ashamed to openly demonstrate such low character. That they do not feel shame is a sad commentary on our current culture.

            Moore lost by less than a percentage point at last count. The voter turnout was low. The GOPIncMSM tactics worked like a charm. Throw up enough mud, smoke and BS as to discourage voters from turning and bam!! the candidate loses.
BTW FoxNews bears some of the blame. They couldn‚Äôt stop bringing up Moore in the same sentence as Franks or Conyors. It was character assassination by associating.

Ordinarily all awards have to be vetted by a board, though.There are *two* variants of the Bronze Star, one for ‚Äòachievement‚Äô and one for valor.  The one that counts is  the ‚ÄòBronze Star with V Device for Valor‚Äô.  Pretty sure his was for REMF achievement.All that said, he didn‚Äôt *have* to do any of it.  So he should get props for his service and chops for his politics.  Not actually ‚Äòstolen valor‚Äô unless he claims his was ‚Äòwith V Device‚Äô and it it actually was not.

                    Samnl;What a memory you have_!  It was Admiral J.M. Boorda.  His tragic end fits well with the current post in that the Progs. used his sense of honor to bring him down.  Roy Moore is being vilified, in part, for refusing to fall for this hoary dirty trick.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Michael_BoordaIn his case it was two Bronze Stars.  He was brought low by yet another Clinton dirty op in the press because he was standing in the way of the feminist take-over of the military.  Wikipedia, of course, skips this aspect of his story.Slightly OT: Your Dad is quite right that in the US military you wear your resume on your chest.  Most of the ‚Äòfruit salad‚Äô on one‚Äôs Class A uniform is made up of ‚Äòribbons‚Äô not ‚Äòmedals‚Äô.  Ribbons are conferred for participation in this or that campaign (e.g. setting foot in Afghanistan) or having achieved some status (e.g. good conduct ribbon for four years of staying away from officially recorded bad conduct: E.g. Captain‚Äôs Mast ‚Äì Navy; Article 15 Non-judicial Punishment ‚Äì Air Force &amp; Army).Medals, OTOH, are much less common and are awarded for individual or group participation in specified meritorious acts (e.g. Bronze Star for achievement) or, most importantly, individual acts of valor in the face of the enemy (e.g. Bronze Star with V).As you say, the specific controversy in Adm. Boorda‚Äôs case was whether being on a ship off Vietnam during the late unpleasantness thereabouts constituted actually being in the face of the enemy.  This is actually a vexed question: Ship took fire, no question; Ship *could have* taken fire, not so clear; Ship completely out of range, probably not ‚Äì but it depends on what weapons the enemy had at the time.

                Not so.  This is a common misperception since most people don‚Äôt understand the difference between ribbons and medals.  See above.
Otherwise one is tempted to think that there‚Äôs way too much stuff on the chest.  This is an arguable position.  Other militaries (e.g. UK) make do with less, some have slightly more (Russia) and some vastly more (Norks).

        His job is to sell copy. First and foremost. As the old media is displaced by the new, dinosaurs like French and Goldberg are increasingly less relevant and mor desperate to maintain their place in a dying establishment. Trolling their own readers is actually their way of trying to generate discussion and controversy; unfortunately these days all it generates is ridicule and derisive laughter from the shrinking readership.Their days are numbered. French is just one more media slob who‚Äôs more than happy to trade his reputation and integrity for clicks and ratings. That will go on only for so long before it catches up with him.

                The print publication was at 140K the last time they revealed numbers. My guess is the number is below 100K now and how much of that is actual readers is hard to know. Mags like NR would get on the institutional lists, like libraries. I would imagine that even libraries are dropping magazines. The median age is 70, so mother nature is pruning their readership. The site has seen its traffic collapse since they nuked their comment section. My posts get more comments than most NRO posts now.Readership does not mean the same thing to them as it does a trade publication. NR makes nothing from ads. Their game is to get donations from rich people hoping to influence politics. They have an endowment to cover a lot of their operating costs, but NR has down sized their office twice in the last decade to save money. The fact that they recently held a fundraiser and could not get $200K speaks volumes.

            After the greatest scrutiny we can only conclude with any certainty that Moore appears to have been a choir boy for going on forty years, which makes him Saint of the Senate. Maybe that‚Äôs why they hate him.

                It seems part of Shapiro‚Äôs problem is optics.  If the guy hid behind an avatar of Ragnar the Terrible and changed his last name to Shrapnel, he‚Äôd probably be more acceptable.  The fact that he looks like a sniveling little beta (you know who) with a nasally voice doesn‚Äôt help.
Driscoll is just as smug and smarmy looking, but to his credit he stays out of the camera‚Äôs eye.

        David French is a Pharisee.  Pharisees went around policing the slightest violations of made-up rules so as to virtue signal to their peers and sit at places of honor.  Pharisees never forgave, showed mercy, or had a single kind word about Jesus, even after all those He helped, healed, and forgave.  Because Principles.If French lived in A.D. 33, he would be devising trick questions about healing on the Sabbath and paying taxes.And his prayer would be ‚ÄúGod, I thank You that I am not like the other men‚Äîswindlers, evildoers, adulterers‚Äîor even like this tax collector.‚Ä¶‚Äù

        With their defense of Bill Clinton, the Democrats taught us the only thing that matters is whether a politician will advance your beliefs through legislation.  The Dems supported a violent rapist to keep abortion unregulated.  Dems actually like crooked politicians because they know they will use any means necessary to advance their agenda.   I have no illusions about the morals of any politician.  I play the percentages and assume they are all crooks and liars.

        One small quibble: ‚Äúsmall salary.‚Äù   I have no way of knowing what French makes, but NR‚Äôs Form 990 shows Jonah pulls down $250K/year, Williamson &gt; $200K and even Lopez is in the six-figures.   Most folks making those kinds of salaries work their arses off in results-oriented jobs.  (If anyone can point me in the direction of a cushy six-figure, results-optional gig, please respond in the comments.  Thanks!)

            True, but $200K in DC in NYC is not that much. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they are not starving. It‚Äôs just that relative to the donor class, these are the salaries paid to servants. Hilariously, these guys all think they slave away for their salaries.

        Let‚Äôs say Moore is guilty as charged.
The Republican move is still to get him elected,  and if convicted, the AL Republican governor can appoint a Republican replacement.
Unless you want a Democrat controlled Senate.  Then see French strategy. He‚Äôs an asshat.

        French really does his best to ignore the Dems.  They would have won if they had found a Sam Nunn type moderate Blue Dog (if any still exist).
Instead they nominated a guy who ought to be running in New York or San Francisco then went with the character assassination strategy.

        Although I have had a passing acquaintance with David French over the years and respect his service in Iraq, I parted with him politically when he supported Romney and other establishment R‚Äôs.  His family would  be great neighbors, but I would not take his political advice seriously.

            It wasn‚Äôt like he was in the infantry in Iraq, he went as part of the JAG. I doubt he ever had to eat (or excrete) an MRE or be truly worried about losing a limb to an IED. This guy is another ‚Äúbox checker‚Äù Ivy League mandarin. Maybe this is what he wanted to be when he grew up, but I suspect like a lot of ‚Äúbox checkers‚Äù he was slotted into this role by his parents who chose for him and by the time he got his hands on the controls, well, that‚Äôs the plane he‚Äôs flying and it‚Äôs too late to turn around and go back to the airport.

                JAG in Iraq at an FOB on the border with Iran is not exactly a Brentwood law practice or the life of silver spoons. So I will accept Mr. French‚Äôs description of his time in Iraq versus your conjecture.

                    Medal inflation has been an issue for a long time. Probably since Vietnam. I forget who it was, but a former Marin officer wrote a book on the subject. The generals want a chest full of ribbons and medals.
I‚Äôm sure he served honorably, but I‚Äôm always suspicious of people who wrap themselves in the flag or wave around their service. Not for nothin‚Äô, but Hitler served with distinction. That does not make him less Hitler.

                        It‚Äôs now quite possible for a soldier to get a Bronze star for pushing paperwork and never seeing combat or even be the war zone. (The AF was giving them out to clerks on the B-2 program ‚Äì that‚Äôs were I first heard about it) For most officers a Bronze star is a automatic gimme. Put the fella in a combat zone for a day or so and there you go. Their buddies do the paper and they get the medal.In general, officers don‚Äôt participate in direct combat unless they are 1st or 2nd louies in a rifle or armor outfit. By the time time they reach captain most are generally out of direct fighting.If French was at a FOB as a JAG it means nothing They don‚Äôt do patrols and worry about getting blown up by IED‚Äôs or shot dead by a sniper. About the only way French would see action if the base was going to be overrun.

                            I think that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch.  Two friends of mine were killed, one in Afghanistan by a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù who executed him and three others in an office well inside the fence, one by an IED (along with the airman who was driving) as he was inspecting roads as part of his civil engineering mission.
Is he Sgt Stryker at Iwo Jima?  No, but I don‚Äôt think he oversells what his mission was or the dangers there.

                            The Company I served with in Iraq in 2009 was allotted 4 Bronze Star Awards (BSA‚Äôs) to give out. We were a support company not involved in what anyone would describe as combat. Just about everyone was ‚Äòawarded‚Äô an Army Commendation Medal. The presentation ceremony was akin to High School Graduation, everyone gets a diploma, with a few honorable mentions for Class Pres, Valedictorian and 100% Attendance.My father in law got one for saving people from from a burning helicopter in Vietnam. I was in the running for one for serving as a Jiffy Lube manager in Iraq.No faster way to devalue an award designed for real honor and bravery than by giving them to everyone‚Ä¶
