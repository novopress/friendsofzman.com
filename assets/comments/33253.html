        Merry Christmas to Zman and to all on this side of the Great Divide. This side will prevail because reality will not be mocked, but probably not in my lifetime.

        I think I will actually try to listen to this, off and on, over the weekend – sounds quite interesting.  Wishing a very Merry Christmas to all here.  Spent several hours yesterday  raking leaves (bought a gas blower but it’s still in its box in the garage) and laboriously   carrying firewood up the hill and stairs to the rack on the porch (bought a wheeled caddy but that, too, is still in its box).  Now I’m enjoying the wood stove and figuring out how many days to defrost the Christmas rib roast.  The world is a woke mess, but up here life is good.  Enjoy your mountain solitude, Zman, and we will enjoy ours.

            @3g –
Outstanding.  I’m stuck in a newly diversified suburb, but not for long…  I’m blessed with like-minded friends and family, and an amazing wife, so things aren’t too bad.  Merry Christmas.

        Merry Christmas to Z and all.I once referred to myself as a constitutional conservative or classic liberal, but I’ve adopted the dissident right label as a shorthand for my views since I began reading your essays (it was a long time before I ever listened to the podcasts, now I hear your voice when I read you).None of us are fans of the current order, so the dissident banner could be quite broad.  I am a Southerner who enjoys telling conservatives that the Constitution died in 1865 and that their civic nationalism betrays their own people.My perfect world is one full of White Europeans, even the Irish and Italians.  You may have grown up with Diversity, but I grew up in Mayberry and have that idyllic view of the Before Times when a bunch of white kids were trying to jump their Stingrays like Evel Knieval.  I wish I could leave that kind of world to my grandkids, but the present reality doesn’t allow for.I’m amused when you mention revenge fantasies (probably unpostable, haha).I like playing Benevolent Dictator myself.  Trebuchets.  We can even make illegal lobbing a pay-per-view sport.  It has great potential, what with some 100 million who need to be removed.Something to wish for anyway.Merry Christmas

            I had a banana seat Stingray with a 5” gear shift mounted on the bar that connected the seat riser to the handle bars. A 5 speed.They didn’t really think through the mechanics of inertia when a boy had to stop fast.
Merry Christmas to all the members and posters . This is my first stop in the morning, and the comments are second to none.

        Merry Christmas to the Zman and all commenters!I found the music question and some of the discussion around it interesting.My contention is that mass popular culture is almost completely dead, having been killed by the perpetually offended Wokesters.The stagnation began appearing in the musical arena in the 2000s and 2010s. I went and looked atRolling Stone‘s list of, “100 Best Songs,” for each decade.Between the two lists there are four, maybe five songs that people still listen to or get played on the radio today.Anecdotally, I was just at a good-sized ski area. All the music on the PA was from the 80s and 90s. There was a young person with a portable speaker clipped to his backpack that was streaming tunes from the 90s.

            I hate going to the grocery store in my diversity-infested area. I find that when I go in the very early morning after they open (6AM), there is (white) American music playing (that you will NEVER hear in afternoons and evenings), and a MUCH higher percentage of white people shopping and working (getting up early to get the hard part of the day’s work done-&gt;white).

                Like many whites, I suspect, I drive somewhat out of my way to shop at the whiter grocery stores. For obvious reasons.

            I tuned out of pop music and pop culture in general in March, 1992 at the ripe old age of 24. It was at that point that there was no longer any pop music I had the remotest interest in purchasing on CD. Prior to that point, every time I got paid I made a beeline to the Sound Warehouse to snag some new record/CD.

                I’m just curious, but what in that month triggered this change?  Was it personal reasons or was it something in the cultural zeitgeist?  At the very least, in March, 1992 popular music was enjoying something of a renaissance.

                    It was just an accumulation of indifference on my part. For several months my interest in current pop was on the wane, and the threshold of total ennui was broken in that month.

                        Was it grunge that put you off? The “I’m a suicidal loser” attitude of grunge turned off a lot of rockers. My brother observed that the young guys who still wanted masculine swagger in their music had no other option but rap, which he couldn’t stomach.
In the mid 80s, most metal sacrificed melody for exhilarating aggression, following Metallica. Many loved melody more so rejected the trade.
Me, I still loved Metallica and Alice in Chains, in spite of the drawbacks.
I quit at Rap/Nu Metal. Not going to listen to wiggers, even if I couldn’t explain why.

                            Points taken, but the Seattle sound was still predicated on testosterone.  That’s why the chicks had to invent the Lillith Faire scene a couple years later, because they didn’t want to hear Layne Staley or Chris Cornell scream.
On another subject, I was at Lollapalooza ’92 (it was a very male scene) and when Pearl Jam came out early in the day and broke into “Alive” it was the closest I’ve ever come to experiencing a Gen-X “moment”.  That must have been what those dirty hippies at Yasgur’s farm felt.  For a brief moment, the world belonged to us.

                                Yeah, Pearl Jam was never as dark as many of the other bands. Eddie was a SoCal surfer after all. “Alive” is especially an outlier because, although it begins with a story of pain, it ends with rising above it. I can imagine how powerful that moment you described was.
As long as we are swapping concert stories, I used to see Alice before they were signed, when they were more of a hard rock band with punk energy. No one knew Jerry could write great songs then, probably not even Jerry.

                Ah yes, Ostei. Sound Warehouse. In my ’70s and ’80s town, the cavernous (and in a later incarnation on the same street, cozy) scene of some of my best memories. Jack Jones, George Strait, Charley Pride, and Wang Chung all went home with me at one time or another.

                By 1992 I was in grad school and had a four-year old and had recognized that pop culture was stupidity at best, and pure degenerate filth at worst, so yeah, I was done with it by then, too. Songs about deviant sex and drug use aren’t the kind of thing you want to expose a child to. Reading Bloom’s Plato-influenced critique of pop culture inThe Closing of the American Mindand Socrates’ discussion of the censorship of music inThe Republichad really opened my eyes, too.Right around that time I started listening to a lot more country while driving and working, and thankfully the 1990s saw a number of country players like Alan Jackson, George Strait, Garth Brooks and Ricky Skaggs who rejected the slicked-up, contrived Nashville pop sound and the Nudie suits in favor of a more honest, “roots” style of country music.The 1990s were a good decade for country.Of course I hated pop music before that anyway, preferring hard rock.Couple of weeks ago at work a Madonna song from the ’80s came on the radio and a 20-something co-worker asked me how old I was when the song came out.“Old enough to hate it…”

            Pop music has always sucked. Except for the late 1960s to late 1970s. Only in that decade could both Yes and Chuck Mangione be popular.Starting in the 1980s, music producers started “creating” acts instead of “finding” them. But guitar-based bands were still popular, and it was difficult to astroturf a guitar band, since the best groups usually had practiced together for 5+ years. I think that’s why vocalists and rappers are the pop acts now…they are singular and respond to money and fame better than a group of dudes who may or may not be in it “for the music, man”.

Only in that decade could both Yes and Chuck Mangione be popular.Ok boomer…I’m (obviously) FAR younger than you, and even I would say 50s music also has some great pop acts and ushered in Rock &amp; Roll for those 60s and 70s Boomer era musicians you so adore.The 80s had their own weird “retro future” style, and the 90s killed the glam hair bands and brought us grunge, alternative, etc. The early 00s is when the decline started though we did get Nu-Metal and some of that has endured. By the 2010s we were well and truly f-cked however. Largely because the (((music industry))) decided to completely remove any more pretense of anything white being acceptable.All hip-hop, all rap, 24x7x365. The Africanization of the West had to happen at any cost, so here we are with white girls trying to get big buffalo asses like Kim Kardashian and somehow thinking twerking (Which baboons and gorillas do too BTW) is the highest form of dance. We have had 15 years of complete stagnation and visual media also tracks pretty well with this. Africans in your radio, Africans in your films and series, Africans in your commercials. Just a cohencidence though, I assure you!

                    I’m not a Boomer though. Drawing from the depths of my intellect, my refined taste, and my lauded dispassion, I can without reservation declare that the years 1969 to 1979 were in fact the best years of popular music. I’m not saying that it was all awesome, but the scale and scope of 1970s music beats any decade. Not even just guitar shit: that decade had the best soul music, the best dance music, the best country music, the best jazz music, the best soundtracks, and the best avant-garde music as well. Maybe it was the just drugs and filthy shag carpets, but that was a helluva creative period.

            The interesting popular music of the 20th century Anglosphere was a highly unusual and unlikely phenomenon found nowhere else in the world (except in pastiche) that died to corporate homogenization, to managerialism and finance—which is what “wokeness” is.The strange electrical folk music(s) of an extreme outlier technological civilization took over the world. It can’t happen again. It’s not allowed and we’re not smart enough anymore.The guy who named the civilizational enemy “globohomo” got it exactly right. That’s why neither the left nor conservatives ever adopted the term. It rightly accuses them both. They do like “global American empire,” because it indicts normality and whiteness, not the regime. You think of Uncle Sam, not Peter Thiel.

            To me another factor complicating things was/is the existence of gatekeeping mechanisms and institutions. In the XX century you needed capital to create a cultural product of high quality and promote it. It is notorious how every artist is a plant one way or another, even original talent needed the support of a don that financed the production.These combines with who controls the banking to create an effective censoring machine. On the other side there is infinite money for debauchery and art that demoralizes the population.The great opportunity of today is how low is the cost to produce and distribute original content. They may try to get you fully debanked so you cannot move even one dollar, but this is a battle that we will win.We may be missing some multigenerational collaboration as some young artists may need advice and moral support to start. We also need networks to protect those that may be debanked for posting cultural products that the bankers don’t like.This gatekeeping factor also has the characteristics of a mafia and they will fight to keep their censoring power.Generalizing the issue with power in America is that we are hostages of a banking mafia that buys politicians, finances cultural garbage, and steals the fruits of any creative work (technological or cultural). You may be the new Henry Ford today but in 100 years Blackrock will own your company and will impose DEI values on it. You may be a great singer/songwriter but your music will belong to Sony Music on the long run. That was the XX century. XXI century has not started in full and it will be the century of the elimination of the middlemen. We also need banks that are not censors of what can be done.

            Odd how this subject came up. The two girls who run the counter at our local bakery were talking about this this morning. Both are in their early twenties, one sings, the other is learning guitar. The singer said that she will not listen to any music from later than 1993. The guitarist echoed her sentiments, saying that her favorite guitar music is from the bands of the 1970’s. I told her to check out Steve Howe’s “Sketches in the sun” and she punched it up on her phone.After watching it for around thirty seconds, she said, “Oh yeah, I need to play like this guy!” Glad to see that there are those in the younger crowd who have some taste and can recognize actual talent.

                There are some green shoots. Some young people, when confronted by the yawning chasm in merit between music produced in 2024 and that made in 1984, strongly prefer the former. It is just possible that there is some thermocline below which culture cannot sink and still retain a sentient audience. And AINO’s “culture” has not only breached that barrier, but has plunged into the briny deep beneath it.

                    There need to be, if not some new instruments, then at least some new instruments brought to the fore. Pretty much everything that can be done with guitar/bass/drums has been. Especially insofar as it’s accessible to the masses.

                        My twenty-something son (and daughter to a lesser extent) also loves music from the 80s as well as the 60s, 70s, 90s, 00s.  It’s really not the era for him, it’s the quality of the music.  There was more of it then compared to now. One of his favorite albums is Brian Eno’s “Another Green World,” from the mid-70s, which he thinks sounds timeless.  For him all of the music from those eras aren’t old, but new and waiting to be discovered.

                            How did your son discover Eno?  That is some serious obscurity.  Phil Collins demonstrates what a unique drummer he is on that album.  Eno shows what visionary music a non-musician can create.
Tell your son that I especially love “St. Elmo’s Fire” and “Golden Hours.”  Robert Fripp’s guitar work is gorgeous on both!

                                I just finished watching the 2 hour Collins interview that was released this week by Drumeo.  It’s absolutely heart-breaking to see his physical state but it was quite a good video as far as these things go.  When you take a step back and realize how many acts Collins was involved with, on top of the gorillion records he sold as part of Genesis and his solo career, it’s absolutely mind-boggling.

                                I think he discovered Eno going through my old vinyl records.  I can’t remember, maybe he liked the artwork.  I’ll let him know you love those songs.  He does as well, especially St. Elmo’s Fire and the song The Big Ship. The album is a masterpiece.
Yes, Phil Collins shines on that album, as he always does on drums.  It’s a remarkable story how he became a singer, and then turned into an international superstar, when really he’s first and foremost a drummer.

                        The persistence of ’80s popular music and ’80s nights based around that music is explained by a very simple fact.
That fact is that ’80s music is FUN. Even the ’80s songs that tackle more serious topics like problematic relationships still sound very bright and lively while they are underpinned by snappy basslines.

                            You’re exactly right, TWGH.  The videos gave them another dimension.  And ’80s tunes were actual MUSIC.  I’m thinking, for example, of the improbably named Spandau Ballet.   Also, Survivor and all those great Jim Peterik songs.

                Steve, we may have our disagreements, but it is a nice surprise that we both love the music of Steve Howe.  “Clap” and “Mood for a Day” are still a struggle for me to play.
Merry Christmas.

        Yes, Merry Christmas to all. Let’s hope it’s not the last one. Here’s a question for a future show.
Why mysterious drones patrolling NJ now? Perhaps a false-flag in the works just in time to compromise the Jan 6th election certification vote. Romania cancelled its recent election of a populist president. A Georgian stooge president is defeated and refuses to leave office. Macron and Scholz are dead men walking but remain in power. Can it happen here?
Inquiring minds want to know.

            I prefer the speculation that such activity can only be at the behest of the military, and further the reason is anti-terrorism—as in searching for radioactive material. Hence the silence wrt who/what of the drones. All other reasons fail one or more logic tests.

                Can’t remember the last time a media hysteria signified anyreal thing. So I’d guess people heard about a “drone scare” on TV—perhaps based on a newsworthy sighting, but probably not—and started flying their neglected drones around, perpetuating the story.
That’s how the 2016 clown terror worked. “Oh right, I have a clown suit…”
That too preceded a Trump inauguration.

                I suppose we can expect a lot of bizarre fuckery from all directions until Jan 20. I’m sure there are still Lefties and Deep State swamp monsters who will try some pretty desperate stuff in hopes of somehow preventing Trump from being sworn in. There are plenty of hysterical pussyhatters (of both sexes) who not-so-secretly wish the US or one of its puppet states to kick off WWIII before then because they don’t want to live in a world where OMB is President. Governor Nuisance in CA is already trying to drum up a new scamdemic by declaring a state of emergency overBird Flu for instance. I expect the news to be extra fake and extra gay for the next month or so. I know I’ll be edge until then.

            9/11 and Pearl Harbor hit the American public like bolts from the blue. Why would the regime telegraph a false flag by flying a bunch of drones around first?

                *raises hand* Oh, teacher, I know this one! Can I try to answer?“Sorry AmericanGoyimGrillers! We could not tell you because it was SUPER SECRET but yes, we WERE searching for a loose WMD all those weeks with sniffer drones. Now that Newark, NJ and the 5 mile radius around it (we should be so lucky!) has been turned to radioactive glass we can finally tell you we TRIED to prevent this.The (Russians, Iranians, insert enemy here) have been planning this because they hate us for ourbrainless goy cattlefreedoms! I know everyone is angry but this is a time to unite like 9/11. So please send your corn fed White Boys down to the recruitment office, we have to fight them over there so we don’t have this happen again here!”Think people are bright enough to detect “false flags” do you? Go walk around outside for a few hours, you will change your thinking quickly.

                    Unlikely. This assumes a unity among factions that doesn’t exist outside of the fever swamp and its attendant derangement. The governors wouldn’t survive a failure to warn even if they agree with the Administration on about everything else; self-interest is paramount even in police states. There is some reason for the attempt to gin up panic but that’s not it. In fact, there seems to be some disappointment that people aren’t sufficiently panicking.

            Some of these drones are reportedly “Pickup truck sized.”
But somehow, no clear videos.  In a world where you can’t pick your nose or scratch your [redacted] wihout it going up on social media.

            Probably an Operation Northwoods-style false flag that can be blamed on the Iranians as a pretext to attack Iran on Israel’s behalf. A drone laden with explosives can hit some target, cause a huge media event, and the public would have no way of knowing if it had originated from and been controlled by Langley, LOL.The “conservative” retards will get into high dudgeon about “them raghead turr-rists attackin’ ‘Murican soil” and Linsey Graham will bark for war as sure as a trained seal in the circus will bark for a fish.You cannot possibly tell me with a straight face that the government knows nothing about the drones or who is operating them. They are running with navigation lights, for fuck’s sake.

        Spot on re the Right’s need for artists. I actually think this could explode since the Left has become so drab and stultified. It is happening now around the edges, actually, but the leftwing chokehold on distribution and exhibition has slowed its flourishing. Still, that likely cannot hold. I agree the United States has eerie similarities to the former USSR, but in all truth it is still not quite as bad, at least yet, in America. For an example, I guess an analogy can be drawn between the largely successful campaign against translating into English Solzhenitsyn’s TWO HUNDRED YEARS TOGETHER and the Soviet embargo Nabokov, particularly LOLITA, but the latter was much easier to do…As far as Trump, yes. There are alarming signs he might continue the Ukraine war and increase visas and immigration, but it is of no surprise. Still, bravery and masculinity need to be celebrated, and Trump exudes both…I look forward to buying your book!Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone here.

        If I had the artistic talent to do it, I’d paint pictures of 7-11s and Targets being looted and set on fire by the fellas.   Title it like, A Day in the Hood or Da’Quan’s First Looting.  Or maybe a Waffle House with a huge fight going on inside and maybe a few windows broke.  Or maybe a 300 pound African American woman twerking on top of a city bus.  There is just so much material.

        Sorry about this clownshow but many may have missed it. Some dude last night tried to (reportedly) kill Nick Fuentes. According to police, the dude committed a triple homicide, somewhere else in IL, then tried to gain entry to Fuentes home with a pistol, crossbow, and “incendiary devices” and fled into a neighbor’s yard when confronted by police killing two of the neighbors dogs.https://www.zerohedge.com/political/nick-fuentes-survives-apparent-assassination-attempt-after-doxxing-suspect-shot-deadZero Hedge Link above. Laura Loomer is reporting that Milo Yianappolis or however you spell his name, who is Marjorie Taylor Greene’s “intern” doxxed Fuentes and offered “bounties” on Fuentes.So that old Jewish lady who got pepper sprayed, if there was doxxing and crazies showed up to try and assault or kill Fuentes, that puts a different spin on things.Related, there is a Tablet Magazine article on how Axelrod and Obama created the modern political social media echo chamber and how it fell apart.https://www.tabletmag.com/feature/rapid-onset-political-enlightenmentI would take issue with the idea that Musk buying Twitter alone was an issue, rather it was alienating large numbers of powerful elites and the public through inflation and mass immigration with the belief that social media was a magic bullet, it would always be 2008, and the opponent would always be McCain or Romney brought the downfall.Eggs in my area are $11 a dozen (at Stater Brothers); Zuck who gave $400 million for voter fraud in 2020 got his Libra crypto stuff canceled at the last minute because Elizabeth Warren thought it threatened her CBDC dreams of programmable money micro-managing every purchase by dirt people.Ultimately the circus is a distraction and what works is traditional patronage networks.

            One thing that (((David Samuels))) glosses over in that piece is that there was no shortage at all of not just willing, but eager participants in the “permission structure machine.” Which no doubt included him for a time. It probably feels better for him to blame it all on the top figure or two in the hierarchy. There’s a lot of other omissions. Reads like a limited hangout. He definitely wants the reader to reach certain conclusions and blame certain people.

        To The Zman:  Thank you for the work you put into your site.  There’s a lot of content out there; yours is my go-to on a daily basis.
(shame on those who don’t $upport it!)
To the commenters here:  It’s an odd thing; after years, you recognize “the regulars”.  Thank you for keeping it civil.  It’s a good thing to know there are like minded people in the world.
Merry Christmas all here.

        Thanks for going on Jaffa patrol, Z.  Seems that all great Neptune’s ocean cannot cleanse us of this scourge.  And now even Zeus 2024 continues to enlist its presence.
Merry Christmas to all.

        Great show! Regarding our local musician’s post about creative endeavors, I’m a sci-fi writer myself. Not going to spam you guys, but does anyone have any suggestions about platforms for promotion to this side of the Divide? Besides the usual suspects, that is.
