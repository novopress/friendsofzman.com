        ‚ÄúThere are only three types of economic activity that can increase the nation‚Äôs wealth. You either invent things, make things or fix things.‚Äù
How about the ‚ÄòService Sector‚Äô? Most developed Nations are passing by a process of desindustrialization, Australia won‚Äôt have any car manufactaring plant on its soil by 2018.

            The service sector is either the servant sector (coffee shop, issuance salesman, mortgage broker) or the people who fix things. Some guy fetching me coffee is not making either of us richer.

        Competition necessitates  hype for firms to stay above water. NPR can afford to be bland because they get guaranteed funding

        There‚Äôs some things I like about Wacky Taki, and some I don‚Äôt.
I had read the article and link you cite. Certainly worthy of discussion, eye opening, in fact.
Taki uses that single/multiple pages thingy as annoyingly obvious click bate.
Recently, it seems to me, that some of the varied contributors, reaching ever farther for that edgy-edge, are becoming a comic parody of their former selves. Reaching, stretching and cloying through the poop and vomit, Jim Goad sometimes jumps over the edge into full-blown psycho sexual mania.

        I am convinced that were government of all levels a small fraction of it‚Äôs present size and scope our personal wealth would be increasing and that the immense dollar cost of government is but a fraction of it‚Äôs true cost to progress and to human development (and is in fact destroying it).

        Thelion of the blogospherecalls it value transference:
‚ÄúAs we move into the post-scarcity economy, where individual value creation becomes meaningless because the world will be swimming in value, people will only be able to make significant amounts of money from value transference, which is inherently a winner-take-all type of activity. Thus the irony of a post-scarcity economy is that median person will become poorer.‚Äù
And so on and so forth, day in and day out‚Ä¶ üôÇ
