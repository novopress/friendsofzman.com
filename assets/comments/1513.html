        You’ve paid too much attention to Sailer.  The black population of New York’s five boroughs declined by less than 1% over the period between 1990 and 2010 (while the ‘other and mixed race’ category went from five digits to seven digits).  The most disorderly components of the city are the Ocean-Hill/Brownsville district and the Bedford-Stuyvesant district, which have homicide rates perhaps 10% higher than city-wide means in Rochester and Buffalo.  There is no need to drive blacks from the city in order to improve public order.  If you wish to improve public order, put cops on the street and allow them to do their work with savvy and professionalism.

        What’s strange about this is that Bloomberg has to know that restrictions on gun ownership are a weak vector in the array of factors which influence crime rates (or, if you think John Lott’s research is correct, such restrictions actually injure public order).  The fact that homicide rates in New York’s non-metropolitan counties average about 1.14 per 100,000 in spite of the popularity of recreational hunting therein should have given Bloomberg a clue.Posit this: journalists, college teachers, schoolteachers, social workers, and mental health tradesmen do not hunt or target shoot; they do not know anyone who does.  They also look down on people who stick up for themselves rather than calling in the authorities, particularly authorities who are manipulative gamesmen.  Gun ownership isdisgustingto these people.Here’s a hypothesis regarding the popularity of ‘gun control’ discourse in certain sectors: it’s a way to stick the bill for the disorder in this country with approved enemies. Holding the legal profession or the slum population responsible for urban disorder is a no-no.  That’s our crowd and our clientele.  Holding the disgusting gun owners responsible is attractive.

            Long ago some heretic pointed out that if black crimes rates fell to the level of white crime, America would have an overall crime rate of the typical European country. The Cult may hot and holler when this fact is mentioned, but they are acting on it. Bloomberg’s New York was a place increasingly hostile to non-Asian minorities. Driving these people from the city became the number one crime fighting tool. The same happened in Boston, Washington and other Cult strongholds.I think this is why gun control has fallen out of favor with even the Left. Guys like Bloomberg are doing it as a cost-free way to get some grace on the cheap. Money is no object for him so dropping $50 million on pointless efforts is like you or eye giving a few hours of our time at the old age home.

        Catholic Church attendance may have been injured by the scandals (church’s are noticeably sparser where I’ve lived than was the case in 1995), but frequency of observance began to decline more than 50 years ago, coincident with declines in attendance at protestant services.  The decline has been more severe in the Catholic ambo, arguably because the Church imprudently mucked-about with its liturgy and daily disciplines, which other denominations did not do.

        Seems to me this was alluded to in Fiddler on the RoofTevye: “…Cause if you’re rich they think you really know!”Make no mistake, I don’t hold the “rules” put fourth by holders of a Torah in any higher esteem than the Bible, Qur’an (sic), or NYT. IMHO, the Movie CAN be a valuable teaching tool, along with even “They Live”, and “Idiocracy”.For that matter, so can examining the religions of Wii and Xbox, Windows and Apple…..Wait…hmmmmm…Operating systems? File management protocols…? Y2K and Apps?Is there a potential “modern” political science/Sociology/Religion teaching tool there? I’m running out of Aesop’s Fables, Tales of 1,001 Arabian Nights,&amp; alia.

            Bloomy’s weird religious callings are the result of too little religion, I think. When everyone in America largely agreed upon religion, at least as far as the basics of Christianity, rich guys could pass through the eye of the needle by actually doing some good. Today, left to their own devices, they cause mischief in search of redemption.
