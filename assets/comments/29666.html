        Totally agree on the European churches/cathedrals ‚Äì they must not be missed.  My experience is mostly in Spain.  The massiveness let alone the beauty are unbelievable.  The architecture throughout the world, inspired by various religions is, to say the least, impressive.

        LOL
Apparently, Milley is going to retire and the top two contenders are a white Marine Corps commander and a black Air Force commander (the first luggage tester to ever command a military branch. Isn‚Äôt that great!).
I wonder which one will be selected.
Magic 8 ball says the military continues its degradation.

            The Air Force commander as Chairman of the JCOS will mimic Lloyd Austin as Secretary of the Department of Defense, putting on spectacularly profitable minstrel shows for ol‚Äô massa Ray-Fe-On, winning on the bottom line even while losing on the battlefield. Dat ol‚Äô man river, he keep rollin‚Äô on to da bank!

        Isn‚Äôt it a weakness /problem than the right is not really Christian?McDonald and Z seems devoted to darwinism. Greg worship his gay paganism. Anglin pretend to be Christian but he‚Äôs crazy.There must be, I guess, a bunch of stupid litteralists which pretend God create plants in 24 hours exactly.And of course, there‚Äôs the legion of cuckstians with the Anglican church, the pope and so on..Oh, and I forgot the jewish-worshippers of a certain branch of Christianity (I bet you Americans know the name of this branch. Protestant sects are too complex for a simple catholic like me^^.What I simply wanted to say is that I don‚Äôt see right-wings leaders who are christians, believe in the Flood, the Bible in a clever way (like Dr Ross and the site reasons.org) but are not crazy like those described above.(there is literally no one openly Christian in the European DR, at least in the French)

            What the thinkers believe is less important than the Christianity you get from the proles.  Right now the proles are following Cuckianity churches that push lefty crap and the remaining right-wing churches are obsessed with abortion, not realizing that ‚Äúabortion restrictions‚Äù are just the new scam the GOP uses to ensure they lose elections when they need to.  This latest judge banning day-after pills is just for the purpose of mobilizing democrat voters since it‚Äôs easy to control women by telling them that the bad guys are trying to control their vaginas.

                The killer here for the middle of the roaders on the issue, is that the extreme anti-abortionists use the late term abortion abomination justification and then run to the other extreme with the ‚Äúmorning after‚Äù abortion.  In doing so, they equate a living, breathing, infant with a blastocyst (at best during that period) and marginalize themselves.

        Christ is not just the King of individuals, like protestants made Him out to be. He is king of every society. Every business, association, nation, state is obliged by God to be Catholic, have Christ as its principle and head. Christian (read, Catholic) nationalism is soundly theological. Read City of God or Pius XI‚Äôs Quas PrimasNow, wHen you drive past a parish with the words ‚ÄúCatholic Church‚Äù on it, it is a counterfeit. THAT church. does not say that Chirst needs to be king of nations. No. It, blasphemously, says that the nation and society must be athiest.  Compare pope pius ix quanta cura with the non-Catholic Vat2 document dignitatus humanae. They both solemnly say the exact opposite things. Which the Cathlic Church cannot do.The structures of the Catholic Church were taken over by protestants, jews and freemasons in the 1960s. So its not fair to say that the Catholic church is going along with any of this. She is in the tomb like Christ was hidden on this Holy Saturday. She is still visible in the her faithful. But they are NOT in the Franken Church that has taken over her buildings.

        Kenneth Clark‚Äôs 1968 TV series, ‚ÄúCivilisation‚Äù is a wonderful way to acquaint yourself with the impact of Christianity on European man. There are 13 episodes of one hour each, and they are all beautifully done. I suggest getting a DVD of the series while you still can. Also, at least for the time being, you can find it on Youtube:

            While not impossible, it is difficult, without an understanding of Christ and Christianity, to understand in ether form or function our Neo ‚Äì Gnostic antagonist (sic.), ‚ÄúWokeisim‚Äù.

The destruction of Christianity IS the fundamental reason for the Western Collapse.The issue is why did Christianity collapse. That‚Äôs where the money is at.

        I‚Äôve been surprised at the persistence of a tiny redoubt against this trend: classical music radio.  Each Holy Week and sometimes at other times they play the civilization-level masterpieces of Christian music: Bach‚Äôs St. Matthew Passion, the Seven Last Words of Christ, etc.  Sometimes the host even *dares* to explain the words.  I‚Äôve lived in a couple different ultra-liberal east coast cities and this has been the case in each one.  Does one dare hope that in coming decades we might still, perhaps as a tiny mercy from above, be able to access our cultural treasures on the (free, publicly funded) radio?  Pessimist in me sees the political correctness seeping in.  A handful of black and female composers are praised far, far in excess of their contribution.  Jewish fiddle music, catchy though it is, is far overplayed relative to gentile folk melodies, let alone Christian music.  But our rulers will have a hard time secularizing, sexualizing and multiculturalising a genre that is 1,000 years old and almost purely religious, moral and European.  So far they have not been able to but I know they are trying.

            I‚Äôm afraid the attack on classic music is far more severe than you realize. There is a full-court press to make classical music ‚Äúinclusive,‚Äù even to the point of dispensing with blind auditions for playing positions with major orchestras. In other words, there has been a successful push to elminate hiring musicians based upon merit and to hire them based upon being negro.I‚Äôm afraid most orchestras will be unlistenable in less than 50 years because their musicians will be incompetent. And nobody will listen. And classical music performance will die. That, I suspect, is the objective. No component of Western civilization is a more flagrant rebuke to egalitarian nonsense and cultural relativism than classical music. That is why it must go.

            Sometimes I listen in the car to the local Portland classical station 89.9 FMhttps://www.allclassical.org/. My wife gives them money during their pledge drives. They are of course a bunch of tiny hatted commies. Their main thing to offset the horrible, evil, racism, patriarchy, etc‚Ä¶ of the music they play is that they are forever celebrating one of the made up ‚Äúinternational  month‚Äù so for a solid month they go out of their way to play whatever tiny number of composers in the classical style are from that victim group. If you click the link you‚Äôll see the picture on the front page is a little black girl blowing out birthday candles (isn‚Äôt linear time racist?) to celebrate something called ‚Äúthe international [communist] children‚Äôs arts network [against White people and civilization]‚Äù.You can always practically hear the strain in the announcers‚Äô voices as they cue up something obviously Christian and religious from one of the old composers. They seem happiest when doing their weekend nonsense which is crap like show tunes and movie scores. They‚Äôre very fond of the Star Wars movies. I‚Äôm sure this is a yuuge shock to you all.

                Yes, I should have mentioned the dumbing down of the content by showtunes and movie scores in the past few years.  This seems to be accelerating rapidly, and is probably the weapon of choice.  Stations also shave off programming hours to add jazz (never big band, always jazz‚Ä¶) or world music or new age ambient-type stuff.  The demographic push mentioned by Kozelskii above is real and harmful but it can only go so far given a lack of available vibrants.  Rather, the progressives will do to classical music what they have done to popular science and popular history: just dumb it down and dilute it until people forget what the real and serious stuff was actually like, and eventually stop missing it.

        As I understand it, there were no extra-Biblical mentions of Christianity before around 120 AD. (The quote attributed to the Jewish scholar/historian Josephus about ‚Äúone Chrestus‚Äù is believed by all but the most fundamentalist scholars to be a later interpolation).&gt; What are the chances that the events recounted in the New Testament happened, but none of the forty historians writing at the time found them worthy of mention?Historian and Richard Carrier presents a lot of evidence for why he believes Jesus may not have existed:On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubthttps://www.amazon.com/Historicity-Jesus-Might-Reason-Doubt/dp/1909697494/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1680900164&amp;sr=8-1Jesus from Outer Space: What the Earliest Christians Really Believed about Christhttps://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Outer-Space-Earliest-Christians/dp/1634311949/ref=sr_1_3?crid=6Q0DKZVVX115&amp;keywords=richard+carrier+on+the+historicity+of+jesus&amp;qid=1680900293&amp;sprefix=richard+carr%2Caps%2C141&amp;sr=8-3Applying the standard that ‚ÄòThe more extraordinary the claim, the stronger the evidence required to substantiate it‚Äô to the claims Christianity makes‚Äî such as Jesus being born of a virgin, walking on water, rising from the dead,  and people being healed when Peter‚Äôs shadow fell on them‚Äî it seems clear to me that *no sufficiently strong evidence exists corroborating the Biblical accounts*; which are about as extraordinary as claims can be, as well as contradicting what science tells us is possible.&gt; So why does Christianity continue to spread?I believe it‚Äôs because Christianity contains a lot of practical truth. If you go through life sincerely trying to selflessly love people like Jesus did, and to embody the ‚Äòfruit of the spirit‚Äô in in your relations with others, you‚Äôll do well. People will like you. You succeed in life.&gt; And you‚Äôre likely to attribute that success to the truth of your religious beliefs.And there‚Äôs no doubt that there are many benefits conferred by Christian belief. If you believe that there‚Äôs a loving, all-powerful God in charge of the Universe, who is personally aware of you, and looking out for your well-being, *that belief will indeed be comforting*.If your religious beliefs inspire you to try and lead an honest and righteous life, *society will indeed benefit*.&gt; But as with any belief, the relevant question is not ‚ÄòDoes believing it make me feel better?‚Äôor even ‚ÄòDoes believing it make me a better person?‚ÄôBecause there are many religions of which a person can answer ‚Äòyes‚Äô to those questions.&gt; The only relevant question is: ‚ÄòWhat is the evidence that it‚Äôs true?‚ÄôAnd it seems to me that Christianity fails that last test: that *the evidence for it is not nearly as strong as the extraordinary nature of ithe claims it makes*.

            ‚ÄúWhen two skeptics meet for no particular reason, there I shall not be also.‚ÄùFrom a purely worldly standpoint, there is no law that says a man named Jesus of Nazareth could not have existed ca. 1 AD (or ‚ÄúCE‚Äù if you REALLY want to be secular.) Obviously, what turns him into fiction are all the supernatural trappings.Nietzsche has several interesting comments on Christ and his followers. As he rarely gives citations, it‚Äôs hard to know whether he‚Äôs reporting on earlier writers‚Äô thoughts, or they are merely his own psychologist‚Äôs musings. The latter, I suspect.In any event, argues Nietzsche, it was St. Paul who, for reasons of his own, appropriated the obscure prophet and his messianic movement and retooled it into what came to be called Christianity.

                ‚ÄúFor from that time forward he would be the apostle of the annihilation of the Law! To be dead to sin‚Äîthat meant to be dead to the Law also; to be in the flesh‚Äîthat meant to be under the Law! To be one with Christ‚Äîthat meant to have become, like Him, the destroyer of the Law; to be dead with Him‚Äîthat meant likewise to be dead to the Law. Even if it were still possible to sin, it would not at any rate be possible to sin against the Law: ‚ÄúI am above the Law,‚Äù thinks Paul; adding, ‚ÄúIf I were now to acknowledge the Law again and to submit to it, I should make Christ an accomplice in the sin‚Äù; for the Law was there for the purpose of producing sin and setting it in the foreground, as an emetic produces sickness. God could not have decided upon the death of Christ had it been possible to fulfil the Law without it; henceforth, not only are all sins expiated, but sin itself is abolished; henceforth the Law is dead; henceforth ‚Äúthe flesh‚Äù in which it dwelt is dead‚Äîor at all events dying, gradually wasting away. To live for a short time longer amid this decay!‚Äîthis is the Christian‚Äôs fate, until the time when, having become one with Christ, he arises with Him, sharing with Christ the divine glory, and becoming, like Christ, a ‚ÄúSon of God.‚Äù Then Paul‚Äôs exaltation was at its height, and with it the importunity of his soul‚Äîthe thought of union with Christ made him lose all shame, all submission, all constraint, and his ungovernable ambition was shown to be revelling in the expectation of divine glories.‚ÄùFor whatever reason, Nietzsche‚Äôs characterization of Paul strikes me as ‚Ä¶ homosexual?

The most ‚Äúancient‚Äù Torah might be from the 13th century, same as the Zohar. And lots of ‚Äúclassical‚Äù pagan works are Renaissance era forgeries, credited to the ancients to avoid trouble. This largely explains why Rome and Greece failed, because they weren‚Äôt as intelligent as moderns think.
Christianity is extremely well documented in comparison to just about anything else, despite persecutions.

            I think the Christian *worldview* is probably most in sync with what modern science and evolutionary psychology tells us about humans. Original sin is as good an explanation as most people need for why grandiose utopian schemes fail for one thing.The failure of modern Western society after abandoning the Christian worldview looks pretty much exactly the same whether you see it as the result of ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs disfavor‚Äù or just the result of abandoning a model of human psychology and behavior that worked pretty well for centuries.I have my doubts about our ability to create a secular scheme that keeps people and society from falling apart but I also have severe doubts about the ability of ANY of the various Christian denominations to restore the faith of enough people for it to matter in the secular sphere of how society is organized. The various Russian Orthodox (and other Eastern faiths) probably have the most going for them but are perhaps too strongly tied to their nationalities. Of course, this is a great deal of their appeal too! What may be needed is an American Orthodox church, British Orthodox, etc‚Ä¶ Traditional American Evangelicalism just has too much ‚Äúused-car-salesmanism‚Äù in it and is too tied to the most toxic strains of American Imperial militarism to offer hope even for the US.

(The quote attributed to the Jewish scholar/historian Josephus about ‚Äúone Chrestus‚Äù is believed by all but the most fundamentalist scholars to be a later interpolation).‚ÄùYou are not even wrong.First, this is not true. Tallus, Tacitus and Mara Bar Sepion are previous to this date. No, Josephus quote may have been distorted by later Christian authors but it is original. In addition, Josephus has another quote about the judgement of the brother of Jesus.The Didache is an ancient extra-Biblical Christian document that is also previous to this date.Second, if it was true, it wouldn‚Äôt be important, because many facts in Ancient History are only documented in one document and this document is always partial and often contains miraculous accounts. See Suetonius, for example. So the New Testament sources are ancient historical sources and you don‚Äôt need any extra-Biblical sources. This does not mean that they have to be accepted completely by historians but denying that there was a movement around Jesus is a stretch, to say it politely.Third, even if there was no document at all about Christianity before 120 d.C , it would not be that strange because Ancient History is fragmentary. The first biography of Alexander the Great we have is 400 years after his death. This does not mean that it is not treated as a historical source. It is.The theories of Carrier are rejected by the majority of atheist scholars. About Jesus being from outer space, please let‚Äôs be serious. There is no evidence for that. What‚Äôs next? Jesus was Batman?Seriously, read more history and spend less time in fringe Internet groups that act as an echo chamber.

                imnobody00:  The historicity of the earliest documentary mention of Jesus and his followers is well summarized in Josh McDowell‚Äôs ‚ÄúMore Than a Carpenter.‚Äù  It was this exact comparison of the historicity of early Christian sources in comparison with non-Christian ancient documents which helped me accept that Christianity is at least as well and often better documented than many historical accounts from classical antiquity.  It appears to me that it‚Äôs purely the subject matter which has caused such intense scrutiny and questioning of the sources.My own faith was the eventual result of being able to drop the anti-Christian bias that ‚Äòmodern‚Äô public schooling and media had inculcated, mocking a belief which supposedly lacked any historical basis or mention.  When I was then able to read, learn, and question without that pre-existing bias and instead ask ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs all true?‚Äù I was finally able to knock and God in his grace opened the door.A blessed Easter to all believers here.  Looking out at the beauty of God‚Äôs creation from my new front porch swing (instead of seeing suburban mcmansions filled with diversity) is evidence enough for me that miracles do still occur.

        It‚Äôs real tough subject. I came to the Dissident side of things via a pozzed, cucked, shitlib hive mentality family. I was conditioned since birth not to see God or His works. I was programmed to see Christians as hypocritical, manipulative, shysters‚Ä¶not realizing that was the old lefty trick of accusing the other guy of doing what you yourself are doing. When that family and part of my life imploded‚Ä¶I was free to see and notice things that were and are apostasy and heresy in Clown World. God doesn‚Äôt talk to me or listen to me‚Ä¶but I am sure I have seen His work and felt His presence. It‚Äôs enough. I spent most of my life an atheist, so I get it with those people who can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt see their Maker. But‚Ä¶here‚Äôs a hint: He‚Äôs right under your nose in plain sight!üòâüëçI wandered for awhile like a jew in the desert seeking people that could see AND think. Faith can blind the same way ideology does. The old Alt Right showed promise until fags like Milo, Vox Day and other clowns and grifters discredited it. It‚Äôs sad because they had merit and credibility until the grifters moved in. I met bible thumping Christians that didn‚Äôt see colour, or the fall of their women or the attacks on them and their children. They thought it made them noble and virtuous. Then I stumbled on your blog, and the creepy dissidents‚Ä¶ and I thanked God and knew I was finally home. I see intelligent people, that can think and change their minds or yours. I saw people willing to fact check, and speak honestly and courteously. Anything can be said here and as long as it isn‚Äôt a troll or obvious mental retardation‚Ä¶it can be discussed rationally. Many dissidents take this for granted‚Ä¶I‚Äôd like them to know that they should be intensely grateful for spaces like this.May God bless you all ‚Äì and have a great Good Friday.

            How many Christians do you suppose are aware of the omnipotent power of j00ish Psychological Warfare Campaigns, such as the following, courtesy of kind old gentlemanly Irving Berlin himself [any s0d0mites in the Z readership will be tickled to learn that it features Queen Judy herself]:

                Don‚Äôt forget. When Z uses the term Christianity, it must be remembered that that includes people that believe that the Bible is the only source of belief, that infant baptism is good or not, and that J*ws must rebuild the temple or not.So, our, ahem, Elder Brothers in teh Faith (the Vatican2 term for J*ws) had no time picking apart a religion that had no coherence.The real problem is protestantism.Here is a great description of this most evil of heresies:Protestantism differs essentially from all the heresies that have previously rent the Church. It is not a particular heresy, nor a union of heresies; it is simply a frame for the reception of errors‚Ä¶ It is a circle capable of indefinite extension, of being enlarged as occasion requires, so as to include any and every error within its circumference. A new error arises on the horizon, the circle extends further and takes it in. Its power of extension is limited only by its last denial, and is therefore practically unlimited. What it asserted in the beginning it was able to deny a century later; what it maintained a century ago it can reject now; and what it holds today it may discard tomorrow. It may deny indefinitely, and still be Protestantism. It can modify, metamorphose, turn and return itself without losing any thing of its identity. Grub, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly, it is transformed, but does not die.Abbe Martin, Paris, 1869

Where did feminism go? Now its trannys a-plenty. Well, the circle enlarged, and we aren‚Äôt so interested in women and their problmes any more.
Protestantism is the problem.And people like Mr Man and Sam Dixon  can never understand thsi. He thinks Catholics and Protestants can just set aside their petty difference (those differences are called Truth), nang on to Whiteness, and defeat the progs.
NO. Protestants have to go go.

        Christianity as that term is most succinctly defined viz., belief in and dependence on Jesus, the incarnated Second Person of the Trinity, has never been a mass phenomenon.  Jesus Himself only called twelve to belong to Him during His lifetime.  Although He did admonish them to go out and makes disciples of all Nations, He also said that many are called but few are chosen.  ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù as it developed after being adopted as the Roman state religion was a peculiar admixture of religion and politics, something the God has ALWAYS condemned even when it occurred among His chosen tribe.  Recall that He eventually rejected Saul after Saul conflated the kingly and priestly functions when Samuel was late to perform the sacrifice before the battle with the Philistines.  The Puritans and Pilgrims were likewise a very small and select group of ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù and they rejected both the established church and the royal government when they decamped for The New World.  Today is no different.  Many people call themselves ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù who have no idea what it means to be one, other than the vague notions they picked up from their parents.  It is clear that God does not have grandchildren, so such inherited nominal ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù is worthless to effect salvation, although it may provide a certain amount of societal stability.  Every individual must make a personal decision whether to believe what Jesus said as recorded in Scripture, or reject it.  Unless it is accepted unequivocally and without reservation, it is meaningless.  Of course, the fact that the descendants of those New England Pilgrims and Puritans abandoned Christianity does not mean they shed their predilection to be ‚Äúreligious;‚Äù  they merely transferred their fanaticism to secular ‚Äúreligions,‚Äù like the cult of feminism, homosexuality and the myriad perversions that accompany them that seems to have captured their imaginations at this moment in time.  They will discover the truth eventually, as will we all, but depending on their timing, it may be too late to do anything about it.

        Christianity ultimately belongs to people of color. They invented it and they have practiced it more purely than the inherently perverse White man ever did. Whites need a religion which genuinely reflects their hollow values, but unfortunately we lack the creativity and soul that is necessary to give birth to a new religion.

        The cross-pollination, if you will, of Christianity and Western European man is a fascinating subject.  There is even allusion to it in Scripture itself (the parable of the sower).  My own humble view is that the DNA of Christianity was set by the NT and Apostolic age, was nurtured by the first century Greco-Roman culture, and then the ‚ÄúGermanization‚Äù gave it different nutrients later in life.  To say Christianity ‚Äúchanges‚Äù or ‚Äúevolves‚Äù  ‚Äì I would probably not use those words but rather ‚Äúdevelops‚Äù.  The DNA doesn‚Äôt change, but how those genes may be expressed can depending upon how it is nourished (the Catholic v. Orthodox traditions are another example).  And as seen today, it can even wither to nothing if it is deprived of all nutrients or fed poison.  The Unitarian Church, for example (if you can even consider it Christian in any sense).

        For not being a particularly religious guy, you did a fantastic job touching on the importance of Christianity and its role wrt Western Civ (of course, all you can really do is ‚Äútouch‚Äù on its importance in a one hour podcast).On the ‚Äúrabbit died‚Äù expression, it comes from early pregnancy tests ‚Äì the rabbit would be injected with a sample (I think blood but don‚Äôt remember) drawn form the woman and if it died (the rabbit, not the woman), I think that meant the pregnancy hormone was present (could have it backwards).

            An early pregnancy test. A rabbit was injected with urine from a female (those were the days‚Ä¶). If the urine contained high amounts of the hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), its ovaries enlarged and show follicular maturation. Regardless of the result, the rabbit was always dissected for this purpose.

                    No they weren‚Äôt. All of them evolved.  Even Joseph Smith probably wouldn‚Äôt recognize Mormonism as it is today.  To the extent that they are initially created, it‚Äôs by a handful of people or even one.We cannot create a new religion by committee of large numbers of people.Faith is closely tied to belief.

            Religions are not made, but rather evolve and the successful ones persist.A short version is as follows. Several tens of thousands of years ago, our species developed complex language skill which enabled our ancestors to ‚Äúprogram‚Äù their youth via verbal communication with ancient wisdom that enhanced their ability to survive and thrive in the local environment of their birth. Religion then evolved as a highly effective means of reinforcing this wisdom training via repetition, consistency of message, and reward/punishment feedback mechanisms. Deities exist as a primary means of dealing with the unknowns (which was a dominant feature of life in the pre-civilization era). Christianity was (and still is) largely successful and persistent because it ‚Äúworked‚Äù for most Europeans in their environment. Ditto for Islam in the Middle East and Buddhism in Asia.At the present time in America, we cast aside religion (ancient wisdom) at our own peril.

                Religion is also selected for or against based on the technological environment present.  For example Islam has adapted more successfully to the modern age by telling Science!TM to f*** off, while Christianity in the West has been worn down by endless needling from the fedoras and noses.Christianity was doing quite well with ‚ÄúGod reveals himself in the workings of nature‚Äù when it gave Europe a huge technological advantage over the beast races, but once science got twisted into Science! by the noses‚Äô rhetoric every new subatomic particle discovered is claimed be proof that God isn‚Äôt real and anal sex is the most moral form of intercourse.

        Overlooked in all of this is WHY Christianity won out over Paganism, specifically against the Roman Pagan Gods; and then again against the Germanic Pagan Gods.The answers are organization, and literacy. Against the Roman gods, Christians were more organized (the Pagans were literate) and fostered greater unity by offering fellowship to the masses while the Pagan priests focused on the elites. This has a lesson ‚Äî the elites as long as they were in control, remained Pagan. But as Emperors more and more relied upon military power, the balance shifted to the Christians who had the masses. There was little in Paganism that appealed to the masses in the end as the connection to the historic people was severed long ago; it was the form but not function of connection to a long-vanished patrimony. While Christianity offered fellowship and comfort directly to the masses.There is a lesson there.There is also the triumph over Odin and the like. That was straightforward. When there was a near total absence of literate people, a religion that offered literate scribes, none able to aspire to Kingship, well that was a no brainer.I don‚Äôt know if Christianity is so corrupted by Woke and Rainbows as to be beyond saving. But something can and should and will replace the current form at least. And to be successful it will have to both rally/comfort most or all White guys, and secondarily organize them into a unified force that has advantages to new elites looking for followers. The new Constantine will look for that which binds followers to him in religion, in other words. Whatever that might be.

            The political aspects of historic Christianity probably help explain how it avoided succumbing to ‚Äúthe cuck verses‚Äù for so long. There really is a lot in the New Testament that lends itself, more or less directly, to a weak, pozzed, effeminate religion unable to withstand even moderate tendencies towards degeneracy. If your religion is ultimately the backbone of an empire and thus needs to allow for no small amount of ass-kicking and outright murderous vengeance a lot of these passages can be overlooked or at least integrated into a definitively masculine and patriarchal whole. Once that rationale is gone you still have verses like Galatians 3:28-2928: There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.29: And if ye be Christ‚Äôs, then are ye Abraham‚Äôs seed, and heirs according to the promise.OMPG! (oh my pozzed Gawd): Jew nor Greek soooo easily morphs into ‚Äústraight nor gay‚Äù. Then verse 29 is actually proto-magic-dirtism! The sermon about welcoming the 91 billion third worlders writes itself. You don‚Äôt even need ChatGPT to help with this one. If ye merely say the Pledge and swear on the Declaration ye are Abraham (Lincoln‚Äôs) seed!Without some political real-world ugliness to encompass (and justify) Christianity floats off into ethereal theology and offers plenty of this-worldly justification for Rainbow World.It‚Äôs a parallel to what happened to the US actually. American culture was always a materialistic soulless cesspool. Without the USSR it quickly wandered away from its old concerns for individual freedom and the rule of law and is now in the process of surrendering what‚Äôs left of its soul to corporate tyranny.

                One thing I have been thinking about is how the elites see themselves and the issues to be solved. Over and over again, they seem to want command from position, ticket stamping (Harvard, etc.) and are enraged when the Dirt People do not grovel. Much/most of what they do is rub the dirt people‚Äôs noses in it; and that aspect comes from the beliefs intertwined that:A  The era of mass industrialization and production is over, a just-in-time globalism will allow them to crush any local uprising conveniently, and thus there is no need to allow the Dirt People their ways and bitter clinging to quote one of them.B in light of A above, they need only keep unity among the Elite hive, moving ever more distinct in luxury beliefs and actions particularly with the Alphabet + people and that the Alphabet + own Dirt People‚Äôs kids and can do what they want with them. Even or especially among the Dirt People, the dynastic impulse is strong so that‚Äôs likely to founder, sooner or later.C They believe they can and will command the masses of the Third World as the Great White Savior per Avatar, Dances with Wolves, etc. as the believe they will always command critical institutions and said institutions will always have power.I do not know if Christianity or some form of it can form the basis of organizing around some new Constantine. I do know I saw an awful lot of Christian / Jesus graffiti along the train tracks in places like the City of Commerce, Downey, Santa Fe Springs, down through Fullerton (you can see that on Google Earth/Maps and see for yourself what sort of people live there ‚Äî working class Latinos mostly) when I rode the train into work (2018-2019). So among certain people the appeal is there. FWIW. Graffiti and the messages they contain are of course interesting. Their existence is a document of at least partial control of the area.

            I think your early history of the Church is accurate. Nietzsche gives a pretty good argument as to why Christianity  vanquished Rome. (Scroll to ‚ÄúAphorism‚Äù 70 and read through  72).
‚ÄúIt is not to what is Christian in her usages, but to what is universally pagan in them, that we have to attribute the development of this universal religion.‚Äù (Aph. 70)

            One of the many achievements of modern mass propaganda is that Normie believes more in democracy than his own personal rights and freedoms. The neocons used this in the early 2000s to crusade for the imposition of mass liberal democracy in crazy places like Iraq and Afghanistan. I wonder if Normie will ever connect the obvious failures of those efforts with the fact that the basic idea (unrestrained majoritarian tyranny) is just as bad an idea here as there.

        A very good book on the subject of Jesus as a mythological figure is, Caesar‚Äôs Messiah ‚Äì The Roman Conspiracy to Invent Jesus, by Joseph Atwill.On another note, I think the reason that virtually everyone in Europe was Christian in the past after dropping various pagan beliefs is quite simply that if you didn‚Äôt profess Christianity, you would be, as Saint Thomas Aquinas so eloquently put it, ‚Äúturned over to the civil authorities to be removed from the world by death.‚ÄùWhen the Teutonic Knights showed up in your village to have a little chat, you quickly got the message that it was best to agree with everything they said.

            Christianity suffered from terrible persecutions under certain Emperors. And the Pagans had a couple of last-ditch efforts to crush out Christianity before Constantine. The failure of the old Pagan Regime was mostly demographic ‚Äî the people who were devoted to ‚Äúthe ashes of their fathers and the temples of their gods‚Äù had mostly died out, and Rome and many other places were filled with either landless peoples or all sorts of imperial flotsam and jetsam.Christianity in the West was weak, basically ceased to exist after the fall of Rome. For example in Britain, outside a few places in Wales and isolated island monasteries, there was no Christian worship at all until the mid 800s with Alfred the Great. And he had contend with constant pagan Viking raids and invasions. Germany was no better, Charlemagne killed nearly a million Saxons to fight Paganism, and Paganism lingered in the North well into the 1400s when Crusaders would fight pagan Finns and Estonians.Conversion in the West was done from the Elite down, but done because it gave the King real solid advantages over Pagans who could only offer him the traditions. Pagan priests were not literate, could not do tax counting and the like, and were not subject to Celibacy and inheritance bans on trying to be King, unlike monks and priests. While during the late Roman period conversion was bottom up; the elites hung on to the old ways until the need for motivating soldiers became so great they had to abandon it.So it worked both ways. Tellingly the elites do not want and indeed like Muslims in the West today, actively discourage conversion to Wokeness and make their religion as exclusive and a ‚Äúconquerors only‚Äù religion as possible. Presumably both groups look at the Dirt People as their upcoming serfs or worse, and do not want them to share the same religion for moral difficulties of oppressing co-religionists.

        Christianity is being sifted and that will continue.  As Christ noted often, Christianity is an elitist religion.  It‚Äôs hard and it alienates both worldly principalities, and common folks.  This world HATES it.  Father and Son are for the few, the remnant.  Christianity ain‚Äôt a tv preacher thing.It‚Äôs been two heavenly days since the King ascended, and in that time ‚Äî due to human nature and demonic interference ‚Äî both Catholicism and Protestantism have institutionalized into largely secular and materialistic entities.  Often, into outright neo-pagan entities, shilling for the masonic New Order, the Great Reset.The Tribulation the world is entering is not just a time of generalized disaster and trouble, but specifically the ‚Äòtime of the tsah-rah‚Äô or ‚Äòtime of the female rival‚Äô.  This means the ancient goddess-worshipping cults have taken power again, as the world ‚Äòfell away‚Äô from authentic Christianity.The globo-homo, occult, woke-fem beast systems are, in Christ‚Äôs eyes, last ditch attempts to shake the people awake and turn them to Father.For members of the remnant, scattered and typically alone, these past two decades, and the period upcoming, are times of unprecedented opportunity.  Ground-floor opportunity in God‚Äôs Spiritual Temple.  The hour is so dark, it only takes a little light to make a difference.  Put another way, you can fire in any direction and hit the target.

        Thanks so much for this nice presentation of Christian ideas and history!  you are absolutely correct about the key role Christianity has played in western civ, and the terrible decline Christian faith has undergone in recent years, not only because of scandals but also because of relentless mockery and marginalization of. Christianity by our very ‚Äúspecial‚Äù friends who have seized control over every institution.  As a comparatively recent convert to the faith, I have greatly enjoyed unearthing and reviving the many forgotten  customs that were once common in Christendom.  Does anybody remember Twelfth Night?  it‚Äôs the last of the twelve days of Christmas, and is traditionally a time to take down your Christmas decorations.  How about Advent?  Nowadays it‚Äôs mostly about calendars full off candy, but traditionally it was a mildly penitential season preparing the faithful for the miraculous birth of the savior.  Epiphany, when the magi honored  baby Jesus, traditionally involved a King Cake (for Christ the King) with a tiny token of baby Jesus hidden inside.  And so on.  there are lots of charming practices like these that have been abandoned, buried, that deserve revival.I used to dabble in Wicca.  The pagans I knew all said that Christianity lacked an appeal to the senses, to the deep ‚Äúchild self‚Äù where religious impulses originate.  they wanted incense, scented oils, storytelling, ritual, and a sense of magic.  How ironic!  All of these elements can be found par excellence in the Catholic mass.  The main thing that sets Christianity apart, IMHO, is its insistence on humility as the essential virtue, with pride being the worst sin.  Looking around at society today, it seems clear that pride has taken over.  We still need God, and nobody gets to Him except through Jesus Christ.

            Hello Violet.  I was wondering what caused your rebirth of faith.While I am not a believer, I respect and like lots of Christians and hope that we can work together in our shared resistance and peacefully coexist separately after we win.Most of the Christians that I know who became serious about their faith later in life tell me that the undeniable reality of evil made them search for some good and that search led to Christ.  Although I don‚Äôt know Ramzpaul, he seems to fit this pattern.While I don‚Äôt expect Jesus to ever speak to me directly, I can imagine myself going down the path that I described above.

                hi, LineintheSand!  Thanks for reaching out in such a thoughtful way.  What made me convert was as you describe:  the sudden, crushing realization of evil, but not out there somewhere; *inside me.*. I lacked a moral compass and was governed by selfish desires.  i had failed to do my duty toward people I loved, over and over again.  Disgusted with myself, I prayed to God for the first time, offering my life to Him if he would take it.  I was astonished to feel directly His presence and love, an experience I will never forget.  it was transformative, enabling me to give up addictions and re-think my entire value system and way of behaving.  Since then I have had two other immediate, palpable experiences of Jesus‚Äôs presence.  You can have this, too.  Anyone can.  All it takes is a sincere desire to Him. I wish you the best and hope that one day you find your way to our Lord.

            Orthodox Christianity is the most sensual‚Äìand mystical‚ÄìChristian denomination. I dare say it gives the various pagan beliefs a run for the money in that regard. It has also proved to be the Christian system most resistant to the ravages of Leftism.

        If the future of Christianity is going be meaningful it is going to have to worry less about its legacy institutions and more about assembling groups of true believers and worshippers who actually hold to the tenants of the faith.  Too many churches are simply social clubs with their worship services resembling religiously themed self-help seminars or concerts and theater.  Christianity needs to remember its roots and how it shaped Western Civilization so it can do it again.

            ‚Äú‚Ä¶assembling groups of true believers and worshippers who actually hold to the tenants of the faith.‚ÄùAgreed, but what are the ‚Äútenants‚Äù?  In there lies the rub.  I‚Äôve yet to attend a church or meet a pastor who does not in essence believe in the equality of *all* races!  This of course must lead to race mixing and continue to expose Whites to the problems inherent in such.Now I have no doubt that these pastors do indeed have a flock of good and decent mixed race congregants.  Hell, such folk can be my neighbors for all I care.  However, this simple (false) tenant of equality must inevitably lead us full circle back to the major problem we have today in this country rather than outline a path out of our current predicament.Color me skeptical.

        The models suggest that religious revival when begin in rural areas following the collapse. A new breed of pastor/priest will arise there that, once again, promotes essential community values and traditions. Hardship will spawn humility and piety; leading, once again, to routine church attendance and post-service socialization events. The productive (and family oriented) will flee cities for these rural havens in order to find order and normalcy; leading to a growth surge. Small town America will return with Main Street shops and community spirit. I know this sounds impossible, but that‚Äôs what the models say is most probable.

        Exactly. The secular researcher by Eric Kaufmann published ‚ÄúShall the Religious Inherit the Earth?‚Äù where he proved that religious people have higher birthrates so they are going to displace secular people everywhere. For example, in Israel.An example are the Amish people. They are experiencing a population explosion. What it is more important: their rate of retention increases and increases.The future is religious. The only problem is ‚Äúwhat religion would this be in each part of the world?‚Äù. In Europe, Islam is being a formidable challenge but, if traditional Christianity survives, can be the winner. Yesterday I was in my third traditional Mass here in Central America and the numbers are growing. Secular people are committing suicide because of their anti-natalist values.It would take a long time, though. Things have to get worse before getting better.

                As long as the primary sources continue to exist, the truths of history cannot be suppressed forever. Like all good things now being disfigured and demolished, historical truth will also rise from the ashes. Alas, we may not live to see it happen.

                    Home schooling and engaging children in home school co-ops are the best way to keep some semblance of our history and traditions alive.  This is where the rubber hits the road for this country:  Is Mom ready to to let the 401k lie dormant for awhile and do what is best for her children?   The Uniparty is probably going to seize it and liquidate it to pay reparations anyway.
Also, is Dad ready to become the sole breadwinner without complaint?  Might have to miss some NFL games working two jobs.

                        Destroying the primary sources isn‚Äôt that easy. The vast majority exist in multiple copies, and almost all of them are referenced in secondary sources, which means you‚Äôd have to eliminate them, too.

                    Most folk, not here obviously, are sent to ‚Äúpublic‚Äù school indoctrination.  Even if we spend the remainder of our time off work at home trying to undo such, we are at a disadvantage.  Also, the most formative years where our  youth considers adults as benign/tricked sources of ‚Äúauthority‚Äù is in K through 12.
I believe the call for home schooling to be the best solution, but made very difficult through the current economic societal situation.  Just recently, my go to alternative‚Äîcharter schools‚Äîhas been under scandal here in my town.  Even they have had Leftist infiltration from the homosexual lobby.

        Christianity is the reason that Europe is still White in my opinion. Without Christ it seems unlikely they would have repelled the Mohammedan invaders over and over.
Until quite recently there were even significant numbers of Christians still in the Middle East (who are also much whiter than the Islamic Arabs).
We have seen what happened to the Zoroastrians, Buddhists, and Hindus over time. Maybe Europe would be Persian coloured today if not for Christianity.

        I would highly recommendThe Chosen. The first season is free on Tubi, and all seasons are free on Angel.If you haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs a very good show (three seasons made, out of a planned 7) that follows the lives of Jesus and especially Jesus‚Äôs apostles during His ministry. Much of the ridicule about Christianity comes from its history of corny or badly-produced media.The Chosenis neither of those things. It‚Äôs well-acted, and well-written, with good characters. It‚Äôs also extremely popular; it‚Äôs one of those Christian phenomena that most people don‚Äôt know about, but would be massively popular were it not for being, er, Christian.I think Z should review the show. It does have characters and dialogue that get uncomfortably close to woke Evangelicalism. (Like the black lady who joins the apostles.) But it‚Äôs the best new TV series I‚Äôve seen in a long time.

            Did you say that this Chosen series made a black woman one of the apostles?  If so, hard pass for me.
Likewise if there‚Äôs any Mary Magdalene/dusky goddess shtick . . . so as to get the light to shine on Woman.  The woke and fembots are always trying to elevate MM as one of their old/new heroine christo-goddesses.  Back in the 70s and 80s these Woman With the Alabaster Jar tomes were everywhere.

                She‚Äôs technically a ‚Äúcamp follower‚Äù like MM. Oh, and Joseph is black too. But I would look beyond these two things. Most of the characters are shades of brown, which is true to what people looked like in that part of the world. I believe it was done on purpose because the producers didn‚Äôt want blue-eyed Israelites, like you see in other Biblical productions.

                    Based on this, I suggest that a much more constructive Series to make would be of the rise of Clovis and Charlemagne or of the Visigoths Christianizing their lands but keeping their pagan faith and their ultimate adoption of Christianity.In other words, perhaps, given the erasure of our people and our history, we should focus not on the origin story in the origin land, but on the real origin story in our lands ‚Äì how it came to be adopted and shaped by our people.Fwiw, in college and Israeli colleague was adamant that Christ and Christianity are purely Greek and have nothing to do with Judea and Yahweh. I was not into religion at the time so kind of clocked out on her presentation, but it was an eye opener.In any case, I agree. Pass on everything that is an energetic hand that furthers our replacment and sweeping us off the stage. Now is not the time to buy into that in any way, shape or form.

                        The roots of Christianity definitely are very Hellenized Judaism at least.  Can‚Äôt really say it did not spring from Judaism, but it is a fair argument to say it is a different form of it than what your typical 1st century middle eastern Jew would think.  So your friend was not far off.

                    Yeah disciple is ok as long as they don‚Äôt start elevating her and pandering to the female viewers.  V. rare to see anything in tv or film anymore that does not genuflect to women, one way or ‚Äòtother.
Feminism is the American religion, after all.
I seem to recall Christ one day letting His mama wait outside a house while He delivered a lecture within on what it meant to be of His family.  I‚Äôd like to see that done on film lol.

            Think the first season is on Netflix or Prime as well.  But not any other seasons (maybe got too popular and the plug was pulled?).
First season was not bad.  Gave the characters actual human dimensions unlike the somewhat overly wrought, overly pious productions I have seen in the past.  Made them seem like, gasp, real people.  Hope the other seasons don‚Äôt disappoint.

        I moved to the Bible Belt a year ago and have already (again) become used to most people going to church on Sunday.  Churches everywhere around here of every denomination as well as unaffiliated churches.  Even a conservative Anglican Church nearby, a Coptic Church, lots of PSA (conservative) Presbyterians, and Missouri Synod Lutherans.

        The Latin Mass, traditional Catholic parish I attend is growing, and has a lot of families with many children. That‚Äôs the future. Although Pope Francis is working to suppress it. But he won‚Äôt last forever. Vatican II was a mistake, as now is obvious, and will be discarded. Then the West will revive. As Belloc said, ‚ÄúEurope is the Faith.

            One can hope‚Ä¶.however, remember the not so distant past of the Catholic Church and the hierarchy.  Start with the long tenure of the most conservative Pope in ages, John-Paul II.  He appointed just about all the Cardinals.  He was from a background of harsh Soviet repression in Poland.  He was followed by another conservative, a German, Benedict.  30+ years of reform and pushback.  Then what happened?  Francis.  In the blink of an eye, the Church was stood on its head and a Leftist‚Äîsome say ‚Äúanti-Pope‚Äù was given the reins and here we are today.How could this happen?  I don‚Äôt know, but it does not bode well for the future if the Church can so turn on a dime wrt past precedent.

                Both Wojtyla and Ratzinger were 100% on board with Vatican II. Ratzinger was a key player in getting the council pushed thru. They weren‚Äôt conservatives by any stretch, until you compare them to Bergoglio.

                    Vatican II was nothing comparable.  Francis is attempting to change the very doctrine of the church wrt biblical scripture‚Äîto say nothing of centuries of tradition.  Aside from the tired old saw of pedophile priests, the changes of Vatican II were nothing compared to what Francis attempts.  One more like him and such changes will be solidified.However, my knowledge and concern must be weighed in consideration than I no longer‚Äîand have not‚Äîpracticed in the Catholic Church for perhaps 50+ years.  I could care less as a former Catholic, but do appreciate the Church‚Äôs positive contribution to a sane society in the past.

                I kind of look at the Church like a stock market graph.  Sure, if you look at an individual day or week, there‚Äôs all kinds of craziness going up and down.  But the Church has been around 2k years.  It‚Äôs had a fair share of ups and downs but survived.  It will still have its share of ups and downs until the end.  Still sucks being in a downturn though.

        The only way for the Catholic Church (or any other Church) to survive and be relevant again is to become radically intolerant. It has to offer a clear and obvious alternative to whatever ideology/pseudoreligion rules the world right now. No compromises, no tolerance and no apologies.

            How does the Catholic Church do that when it insists that the teachings and morality never change?
(chuckles)
I know many religious types don‚Äôt really care about the logical consequences of what they are saying.
However some of us former members really did get bothered enough by these contradictions.
The credibility is gone, the spell is broken. We will never be back regardless of what ‚Äúchanges‚Äù

                    The Latin mass vs native language mass never seemed a big issue to me except that it was mandated.  My understanding was before this last Pope there was a lightening up of the mandate.  Certainly there were church‚Äôs locally that advertised they did the traditional mass.
Odd thing is, I never ‚Äúheard‚Äù the mass in Latin.  As one raised in a parochial school environment, grade school on, we were taught the Latin and then the English translation.  I spoke out loud my required Latin responses, but thought always the words in English.

        A good time to revisit Devon Stack‚Äôs look at anti-Christian messaging inThe Simpsons.  The greater point being that such propaganda was certainly not limited to one particular show.  Once the scales fall from your eyes, it‚Äôs astounding how pervasive this stuff is and has been for a long, long time.

            I think one of the biggest differences between leftist propaganda in media ‚Äì television, movies, etc. ‚Äî in previous decades compared to today is you had to actively seek out the agitprop.  It wasn‚Äôt all pervasive until relatively recently.For instance, in the 1970s everyone knew ‚ÄúAll in the Family‚Äù was a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù show, you might be entertained, but you knew upfront as a viewer you were going to get a lecture if you watched it.  Conversely, you probably weren‚Äôt going to get a heavy-handed lecture on some trendy issue if you tuned into an episode of for example, ‚ÄúThe Rockford Files.‚Äù  Now it seems nearly every TV show or movie has to have some element of Woke propaganda. It‚Äôs baked into the cake.  Now you have to actively avoid being lectured.

                Going off on a tangent (mea culpa) but it seems to me all the television series in those days had some message. Thus ‚ÄúThe Flintstones‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Jetsons‚Äù were stating that the American suburban way of life existed in the time of dinosaurs and would persist indefinitely into the future; ‚ÄúThe Munsters‚Äù showed that while Hermann Munster and his vampire father-in-law might have been ostracized and persecuted in Europe, here in American they could be regular Americans (well, almost); and series like ‚ÄúThe Man from Uncle‚Äù and ‚ÄúMission Impossible‚Äù were to show that US spy and intelligence agencies were making the world a better place.

                When every show has ‚Äúwoke‚Äù baked into it, it is not obvious.  That is the problem.  It has become mainstream and simply accepted by those of a new generation as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

                    Do you remember when the Simpsons made fun of Bush the Elder, he replied that he wanted an America more like the Waltons than the Simpsons, and everyone mocked him?
I gleefully mocked him at the time.  Now I agree with him.
I remember the Simpsons being striking at the time due to its cynicism and nihilism.  Now, every small child watches it in reruns, like I watched ‚ÄúLeave it to Beaver‚Äù in reruns as a child.

                        ‚ÄúSimpsons‚Äù had nothing on ‚ÄúMarried with Children‚Äù when it came to cynicism.  It painted an empty and unhappy family where the father is a failure, the mother a lazy ball buster, the son an incel, the daughter a slut.  Really, really dark.
Ironically, Al Bundy can sort of be seen as a pathetic conservative figure.  He longed for his boyhood of watching John Wayne and (futiley) battled the forces of feminism and liberalism.

                        During that same period, Dan Quayle was attacked by the press for opining thatMurphy Browndepicting single motherhood as a glamourous lifestyle choice was detrimental to our society.  Although the  media clearly disliked many conservatives prior to Quayle, he was the first one who would receive an unadulterated, highly personal feeding frenzy, setting the stage for Chimpy Bushitler*, Chillbilly Sarah Palin, and Bad Orange Man.
* Sure, he was a complete disgrace as President, but not for the reasons he was attacked by the media.

                        Cosby show was his response to the typical Black dysfunctional family shows of the time.  He was lambasted roundly for his criticism of such.  But he had a point, If Blacks were to take their place as ‚Äúequals‚Äù in society they had to act as equals‚Äîhence his show models a Black successful family (in his mind anyway, he over did it).
The irony of course is now apparent, Cosby was a great dysfunctional Black pervert himself in real life.

                        For sure, people loved Archie.  But the messaging was still clear: he was an ignoramus and wrong.
‚ÄúFamily Ties‚Äù originally wanted the parents as stars.  The point of the show was that the hippies were cooler than both their square parents AND their kids.  (Talk about narcissistic)
Of course, Michael j fox was so appealing that Alex p. Keaton quickly became the star.  But apk was only conservative in the sense of being a ruthless capitalist and it was always the Left wing moral values which would reveal themselves to him to be true

            The Simpsons was Tribed up, for sure. I have watched that Stack piece, and he makes good points, but I disagree with him. I think The Simpsons showed some reverence for Christian piety.* Flanders and Fr. Lovejoy were made fun of, for sure, but they weren‚Äôt ridiculed or mocked. By my definition anyway. There were a few episodes that were pro-Christian, albeit in a very modern, jaded way.It may have been the last popular TV show that depicted Christianity in a good or normal light. Fast-forward to Seinfeld‚Ä¶now that‚Äôs mockery.*I only watched the first eight or none seasons, then I stopped. So I‚Äôm basing this on my watching in the early 1990s.

                The Simpsons is oddly enough a ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù show‚Äîas set in the late 20th century modernity.   A hard row to hoe, but note that the bumbling, selfish, oafish clown Homer *always* in the end does the right thing for his family.  His wife, always meets his antics with love and forgiveness.  Family integrity is not a Left-wing value.  It is a Right-wing value.

                The first 9 seasons of the Simpsons are GOLD, maybe the best TV of all time.  I agree with your appraisal of it being jaded to Christianity, but still somewhat respecting it and the idea of the family.  I‚Äôm sure for the past 20 years it‚Äôs devolved into utter crap.
Seinfeld never mocked Chritianity.  It barely brought up religion at all except to make fun of Jewish Rabbi and Puddy for being a Christian.  But Seinfeld was a show about ‚Äúnothing‚Äù; a secular godless world of frivolity.  I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a HOSTILE show, though, like ‚ÄúCurb Your Enthusiasm.‚Äù

                Early Simpsons I‚Äôd say they were more balanced.  Ned Flanders was a religious nerd but the joke was always that not only did the Flanders have a better life owing to their religious discipline, but God actively intervened on Ned‚Äôs behalf (Simpson‚Äôs house burns down, the fire spreads to Ned‚Äôs house and then a localized cloud materializes to snuff it out).Later seasons the writers really got a boner for the idea of having Ned suffer for his religious beliefs.  The joke became Ned was religious, therefore God was going to treat him like Job because God is a dick.  Also, instead of just living a wholesome family life Ned had to become an anti-vaxx homophobic bigot.The show was always left-wing, but it followed in suit as the left became increasingly vile over the past couple decades.

                Speaking of unserious and childish, my sister‚Äôs rural Oklahoma GOP county meeting last night was highlighted by those attending (most of whom are evangelicals) being expected to play a game on their phones called ‚ÄúCahoots‚Äù, or perhaps ‚ÄúKahoot‚Äù.  No one under 35 or 40 in sight, and still yet eyes were glued to screens and, as announced at the meeting, people were having ‚Äúfun‚Äù.   This was all instigated by a woman, of course.My sister and several older men refused to engage.  My questions is, why didn‚Äôt one of these older men stand up and hurl a thunderbolt, pointing out that our country is crumbling and you immature dolts are spending our precious time on a phone game.  Not one minute was devoted to election integrity or any other worthy issue.These evangelicals have been co-opted by the entertainment/military complex.  Sounds like they could use a little hellfire and brimstone, which thanks to their frivolity they may get in the form of a Russian nuke.

They eventually joined the UCC ‚Äì it‚Äôs now a tiny shell of what it used to be and slowly dying,  A crazy social justice pastor with a rainbow scarf gives ‚Äúsermons‚Äù to tiny audience each Sunday.  When everyone in parents‚Äô generation has passed away, the church will simply end.

            Unfortunately, that‚Äôs to be expected in places like New England. There‚Äôs a church in the center of Concord, MA with a Black Lives Matter sign on their property. It‚Äôd be a shame if one of those fake candles they keep in their windows would catch fire.

        Western civilization is based in race, not religion. African Christians wouldn‚Äôt be able to replicate Western civilization if you gave them 10,000 years. The same with mestizo Christians in South and Central America. The West would have existed apart from Christianity and with Whites the West would never have happened, no matter what allegedly occurred in the Gospels. Religion is an aspect of culture and culture is downstream from race.

                Correct. Without Christianity, the history and culture of the countries in Europe in America would have been radically different. There would not have been Western civilization but something else. This is not to say that race is not important. It is. A culture is a combination of things.Let me put an example. Why doesn‚Äôt Europe have tribes, like African people or most of the world until recently? Because the Catholic church forbade the marriage between cousins in the Middle Ages. If you get married with a person from another tribe, tribes get diluted until disappearing.Of course, you could argue that many African countries have tribes and are Christian, but this is because Christianity in Africa is a recent phenomenon ‚Äúa mile wide and an inch deep‚Äù. With some centuries more, African tribes will also disappear, at least in Christian countries.

                Perhaps you ought to read history instead of making it up. The conquistadors were not clerics looking to save souls, they were government contractors trying colonize natural resources. Conversion was incidental, not the point. It should probably also be noted that the current pope is the descendant of this alleged ‚ÄúOld Christianity.‚Äù

                    The conquistadores were entrepreneurial bandits. They were were seen as such by the governments of the time and especially their own, the Spanish crown.  Who wer appalled at their treatment of the natives and sent clerics and more respectable governors as quickly as was feasible.  All of the conquistadores came to ignominious ends.  So that‚Äôs not just presentism.The military conquest of the conquistadores was also quite amazing and undervalued historically.  The conventional wisdom has been that their victory was inevitable due to the tech and diseases they brought with them.  That is not correct.  They were very skillful in splitting the coalitions that were the Aztec and Inca.  In both cases they completed the conquest commanding composite armies with larger numbers of native warriors than their opponents.

                        Nothing special about the Conquistadors (IMO).  One can read much the same thing wrt the early American colonizers on the East coast.  Lots of tribes vying with other tribes and thinking an alliance with the English colonizers would give them an edge over rivals, but it was a Faustian bargain at best.

the expression the rabbit diedfor a women being pregnant actually comes from 30s and 40s when they would use rabbits as pregnancy test by injecting womens pee into them.
evidently a pregnant womens pee would contian a hormone that would react in the female rabbit deforming its ovaries

        ‚ÄúOn the other hand, there is a revival in what can best be called Christianism or maybe ad hoc Christianity. These are the people saying, ‚ÄúChrist is king!‚Äù in the political context and the people rallying to what they call Christian Nationalism. Calling this Christianity feels like a stretch as it has little in the way of theological underpinnings, but it suggests a strong desire to adopt or create such an underpinning.‚ÄùThe revival is there, in parts. But I don‚Äôt see the hankering for theological underpinnings. Mostly I see a cult of Jesus. Early Christianity grew out of its Jewish roots in a Hellenistic world and as such reflects a fusion of Jewish religious thought and Greek philosophical thought. But I see little reflection of this in the revival. Perhaps I‚Äôm not seeing something or am otherwise at fault.

            You are right.  So much of it here in the South is the Jesus cult, which itself has been reduced in large part to Jesus-is-my-boyfriend songs.  The adherents wouldn‚Äôt know Greek philosophical tradiiton if it smacked them in the face.
As for the aspect of Jewish religious thought, the closest the Southern evangelicals come to that is their mindless prostration to Israel, isolatedly at best typified by the observation, noted by Florence King, that ‚Äúby dern, those Jew boys sure can fight!‚Äô
And now, wokeism is poking its nose into the Southern Baptist tent.  This should be interesting.

                    I am not a big fan of Bible studies precisely because of that reason.  Like Z man says, he is no theologian, but as much as we dislike it, it does take some serious theological and philosophical study (not to mention a decent knowledge of history) to really plumb the depths.  The overwhelming majority do not have the time, desire, or patience to do it so it usually devolves to read this passage ‚Äì what does it mean to you, or worse, how does it make you feel?If I knew what it meant, or cared about how it makes me ‚Äúfeel‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt be wasting my time with you people.The other side of it is that formal theological study has become so corrupted you can‚Äôt trust the ‚Äútheologians.‚Äù Too many agendas.  So we continue to peer through that glass darkly.

The difference is you can be spiritual in your heart with no outward underpinnings, but  ‚Äúreligious‚Äù person always has to exhibit how holier than thou they are, that‚Äôs why ‚Äúchurch‚Äù has no attraction for me at all.

                ‚ÄúWhat about the millions who lived and died before Christ, were they good people even though they may have prayed to a carved wooden stick?‚ÄùThe official Catholic explanation is that they are saved (go to Heaven) as long as they fulfill three conditions:1) They are ignorant of Christianity but not because their fault (invincible ignorance). This rules out the vast majority of Western people but applies to people before Christ and most people in Islam and other cultures.2) They conduct themselves following natural law. That is, they are ‚Äúgood people‚Äù as you say.3) They try to please God (or the gods), however they imagine Him to be. Even if they think it is a carved wooden stick.I guess other Christian denominations have similar doctrines.‚Äú‚Äúreligious‚Äù person always has to exhibit how holier than thou they are,‚ÄùBroad generalization. It is not always this way. And ‚Äúholier than thou‚Äù behavior does not depend on religion. Secular people exhibit it more frequently than religious people. You only have to see the news and the woke movement, the politicians, etc.

                FWIW:As far as people who never heard the gospel being damned, idk. I chalk it up to the Lord working in mysterious ways. He has a plan for Creation, and I totally reject the notion that we can know that plan, who‚Äôs damned or saved, when the End Times will be, etc. It‚Äôs called faith, but people keep wanting knowledge‚Äî like Adam and Eve, I‚Äôd say.I‚Äôm ambivalent about church. Obviously it‚Äôs hugely important, and I think its sorry state is as much about corruption at the top as it is about normal people dropping out. If I‚Äôm normal, I‚Äôm one of the dropouts lol. I‚Äôm certain my Protestant tradition informs my relationship with the church. Politics corrupts faith imo, but every organization is going have politics. Still figuring that one out. Maybe in the world but not of it applies, idk. In the church but not of it, something like that.I mean, most of the religion seems in service to the church (which IS very important), but I wonder at what point it‚Äôs church and not faith.Sorry for being long-winded.

To be more specific, that we can discover the plan. Revelation, I get, but then you have to ask yourself the difference between revelation and discovery, and that gets complicated lol. For instance, was the Trinity revealed, or did the Cappadocians discover it as a solution to theological questions? So I keep coming back to faith.

                        Seems we are on a ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù basis.  We should be able to know enough for or own salvation, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can know the whole plan.
As far as the Trinity being revealed or discovered, I would say both.  Seeds of it are in Scripture (if not outright stated  ‚Äì e.g., baptize in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost), which are later discovered and expounded upon when hashing out solutions to theological questions.

                Marko, the Russians are certainly the arch-traditionalists of a traditionalist church. Because, I think, they know what is at stake. The persecution by the Bolsheviks was the most brutal in the history of Christendom, I think. Interestingly, during the Summer of Floyd, the metropolitan for mid-America released a pastoral letter stating that the faithful should NOT support BLM, etc. He said it was no different from Bolshevism and ‚Äúwe know how that turns out.‚Äù

        I haven‚Äôt listened to the show yet, but the show notes are already pretty alarming. Anyone who thinks that the Protestant Reformation was ‚Äúa process of renewal‚Äù simply does not understand Western history or Christian theology at all.The ProtestantRevolt, as it ought to be called, was to Christendom precisely what the French Revolution was to the Western culture. It was not a renewal of things, it was the end of things. I an example of people exalting themselves above legitimate authority and eventually abolishing the very idea of authority. The whole form in microcosm can be summed up in Cromwellianism: parliament without the king, the court eunuchs usurping the throne and murdering the king from whom alone the throne receives its majesty and significance.To understand this dynamic in the political-cultural sphere, read Oswald Spengler. To understand it in the religious sphere, read Hilaire Belloc.The historical progression from Protestantism to wokery, from ‚Äúevery man his own priest‚Äù to ‚Äúevery priest, his own boy,‚Äù from the 95 theses to the 57 genders, is quite clear and distinct in the historical record. Protestantism leads to puritanism, which leads to ‚ÄúEnlightenment,‚Äù which leads to rationalism, which leads to practical atheism and economic theories in the place of philosophy, decadence in art, and finally exhaustion, cynicism, and postmodernism. The path is inevitable.One of Zman‚Äôs drawbacks is that his beloved ‚Äúevolution,‚Äù which he takes to be an all-powerful solution calculator, is in reality an artefactual thought that lies quite late in this progression, coming in around the rationalist period, and which is really a shallow take on an existence no longer understood, an unmetaphysical metaphysics, a scheme rather than an explanation. Were it not for this, I believe he could be a great warrior on the side of truth. He has a quick and fertile mind, and he communicates well.

                As a Catholic, I am positive that the nascent Protestants had valid complaints. Luther is a complicated character: he hit the nail in the head in some topics (corruption) while being completely absurd in other topics.But they should have been fighting inside the Church instead of creating another Church. You could say that this could have been unsuccessful. Fair enough. But dividing the Church didn‚Äôt solve the problem either. Protestant churches have the same problems as the Catholic Church, but they cover them better. They divided Christendom for nothing.Speaking in a secular way, the most harmful thing was Sola Scriptura. Imagine that Luther had founded its own church and that‚Äôs it. There would have been two Western Churches: Catholic and Lutheran. Bad but not disastrous.Sola Scriptura is like having an only Constitution but each American person is each own Supreme Court to interpret it. A recipe for chaos that created 30 thousand Protestant denominations and relativism, which produced today‚Äôs world (for example, wokeness).Something so absurd that no culture has it. Islam, Judaism and even tribal religions have religious authorities that interpret the holy texts. Luther didn‚Äôt think it through and opened the Pandora‚Äôs box and later regretted it.

                    In 1538, Luther wrote:‚ÄúI . . . have been now in the ministry of Christ about twenty years, can truly witness that I have been assailed with more than twenty sects, . . .

This shows that Luther didn‚Äôt think Sola Scriptura through.In 1538,  Luther wrote: ‚ÄúWho would have begun to preach, if we had known beforehand that so much unhappiness, tumult, scandal, blasphemy, ingratitude, and wickedness would have been the result?‚Äù [Walch.

                Luther was the classic throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Take one of his more better known complaints ‚Äì the selling of indulgences.  Was there abuse in that practice?  Sure.  Does that invalidate the existence of a time of purification after death (purgation, hence ‚ÄúPurgatory‚Äù)?  No ‚Äì the abuse of a thing does not negate the existence of it.  It doesn‚Äôt even negate the granting of indulgences (one of the main motivations for engaging in the Crusades).  No more than an abusive king would negate monarchy, or vote fraud would invalidate representative democracy if either of those are your thing.To answer you directly, what he should have done was petition his bishop and the Pope to redress those grievances ‚Äì and suffered the consequences.  Plenty of examples of saints who did the same (was it Catherine of Sienna or one of the Catherines that dressed down a Pope?) and got executed for their troubles, but eventually brought about correction.  Not too different from those who want to flee the GAE rather than stay and fix it.

            That‚Äôs one argument. Another is Christianity would have died already without the Reformation as Catholicism tended to be less central in the more dynamic and secure areas of Europe and thriving in those parts of the continent more vulnerable to Islam. I don‚Äôt have enough familiarity to offer an opinion, but encountered that theory frequently before it became taboo to discuss Islam negatively.

                That is a totally messed up and misleading description of that theory, disregard it. I may dig around and find what it actually says, but the Islam prong is wrong although the centrality part is not, only inaccurately described.
While at it, certainly Protestant America has done more to destroy the faith in recent years yet Orthodox Russia endured communism and has become a bulwark of Christianity. Only one of those suffered Muslim invasion.

            I don‚Äôt have time to address every wrong notion you‚Äôve written, but I will address a couple.‚ÄúProtestantism leads to puritanism‚Ä¶‚ÄùThis is false. Puritanism is the heresy of Catharism (from cathari, meaning pure). This heresy predates protestantism, and has come up cyclically in the Church‚Äôs history. There is no link between the two except that which exists in your mind. Hilaire Belloc‚Äôs book on heresy goes into this in some detail if you‚Äôre interested in learning more.‚ÄúI [sic] an example of people exalting themselves above legitimate authority and eventually abolishing the very idea of authority.‚ÄùThis is mostly false, in that the people claiming to be legitimate authorities were delegitimizing themselves, and had been since the early 14th century. In brief, the basic social contracts were that peasants worked to provide for society, and in exchange their lords would provide protection and justice, and the church would offer reconciliation and charity. The black plague and the hundred years war led both clerics and the aristocracy to exploit the peasantry and abuse it, while failing in their duties. The peasant class kept it‚Äôs ever of the bargain by providing for society, but the other estates did not keep theirs, thus delegitimizing themselves and justifying reprisal on the basis of breach of contract. Barbara Tuchman‚Äôs A Distant Mirror provides a fairly good picture of what the 14th century was like, which helps contextualize the Reformation, if you‚Äôre interested in learning more.

                Puritanism comes from Calvinism. And Calvin only tried to systematize what Luther had taught in his contradictory and polemic way.
Puritanism is the logical consequence of Luther‚Äôs thought. The Lutheran Church does not follow Luther completely: it retains some things from the Catholic Church and contradicts Luther in several key things. The real children of Luther‚Äôs thought are the Puritans.

                My reading of European history is that most monarchs used Protestantism or Catholicism as a fig leaf to settle their grabs for power.  I do agree that monarchy is supposed to be a two way street ‚Äì the subjects owe duties to the monarch, and the monarch owes duties to the subject.  This probably worked well enough when the kingdom was of a certain size and the king and subjects were not too far removed from affinity and consanguinity.  But it seems, like democracy, it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúscale up‚Äù very well.  Perhaps you needed the intermediary aristocracy to keep the monarch in check.  I guess the equivalent check in the GAE would be state and local authorities, but they have been pretty much stripped of real power by the all encompassing phed.

I hate to keep hammering this, but I think it‚Äôs an important theme:
Rome split into the Greek east and Latin west. Ancient Germanic people wanted to be part of Rome, Rome collapsed.
Great Schism, Reformation. Three churches for the same three parties. Even split in the same order, along the same lines.

        ‚ÄúChristianity is strongly associated with the Western tradition and that means it is viewed as white by the antiwhites.‚ÄùI have to disagree, and disagree very strongly. The great majority of Christians today are in the Third World, specifically Latin America and Africa, with smaller groups in Asia. And Third World Christians are at odds with their white coreligionists. African Anglican bishops have all but excommunicated American and British Anglicans/Episcopalians. Many Second and Third World Christians may be antiwhite, but that is because of colonialism, not Christianity.The antiwhites you write of are Europeans and Jews living in the West, who have little or no contact or awareness of the Second and Third Worlds.

Take out the input of Greek philosophy and there is no Christianity. How much these Christians in the third world are aware of this I do not know but I suspect it‚Äôs more about worshiping Jesus.

        I grew up as a WASP Episcopalian, then my family transitioned to a Latin Mass Anglican Church as ours became pozzed in the 1980s. Now I don‚Äôt attend at all b/c the local parish is completely Fake and Gay to the point I can‚Äôt even deal with the fellow parishioners. It‚Äôs really sad because I valued it for all the reasons that any sane person of modest faith did, a structured place to celebrate the faith, community, and history (it happened to be a very old and historic parish).We don‚Äôt and cannot realize how severe the social breakdown was during the wars of religion in Europe in the Middle Ages and I suspect that there will be something similar when people get pushed into a corner. We might be a post-modern society but we are certainly not post-conflict.

                Never understood why VD was a thing. Not that I have anything against him, I used to occasionally read his blog. I think I may have found Zman from there.But who is he? I understand he‚Äôs a moderately successful scifi writer, but that hardly makes him an oracle. I note that a number of dissidents seem to regard him with deference, but based on his blog, I haven‚Äôt figured out why. Occasionally he comes up with an interesting insight, but mostly goes off on rants about topics that would seem to concern few people beyond himself.He seems to be an OK guy, but if there‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs regarded as any kind of authority, it‚Äôs gone entirely over my head. He‚Äôs just another guy with an opinion and a blog.

            As I recall, ostentatiously praying on the street corner came in for some criticism in scripture. Better for one to pray in the closet was the recommendation. Live it in truth, and don‚Äôt flaunt piety around, throwing up virtue signaling like chaff.

                That has to be taken in context ‚Äì ostentatious praying as a form of virtue signaling, yes that is to be avoided.  Ostentatious praying as a form of defiance/protest against our persecutors ‚Äì that is a different thing.

        I get your resistance to ‚Äúteleologies‚Äù and ‚Äújust so‚Äù stories, and the idea that what‚Äôs being done to us is deliberate, but it‚Äôs not a sentiment I share. Even if the process is not conscious, I really think they do get up every day thinking of how to make us miserable, and more importantly‚Äîinculcating despair in us, feeding on our misery and rage as if it were their daily bread.That‚Äôs the real power of Christianity, a resistance to despair that‚Äîif grounded in genuine faith‚Äîactually grows whether it encounters despair or good news. It‚Äôs what separates us from pagans, who make sacrifices to see transactional returns from their gods. The Book of Job is THE book for these times. It will let you yawn  and roll your eyes through the shrill screaming of those TV pundits and campus freaks and politicians speaking about their victory and your destruction, as if it‚Äôs part of the arc of history rather than temporary. It‚Äôs pretty clear their temple is crumbling already; it just sucks that we live within its walls.Hard times are coming, maybe literal hunger, as is more violence, as the antiwhite behavior has grown from the cold war stage to the thermonuclear stage. Maybe more and stronger viruses will even be inflicted on the public (much more effective strains have already shown plaguelike efficacy in knocking off mice in trials.) But:‚ÄúThou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field‚Ä¶and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace.‚Äù-Job 5: 21-24

To get to my current worldview, I had to stop deferring to the saying, ‚ÄúNever ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence.‚Äù  That saying, while containing a lot of truth, functioned as an inhibitor to pattern recognition.
Just because you‚Äôre paranoid, doesn‚Äôt mean that they are not after you.

            Good general counsel.  Likewise Book of Job recommendation.Scripture is a living road map that adjusts in one‚Äôs hands, but always is true.  About 30% of the Bible has specific prophetic info about our moment in time.These are powerful tools and weapons, use them.Despite the slide into Trib there is no despair in me.  As for depression I don‚Äôt believe in it, it‚Äôs a bunch of self-absorption.No real Christian gets depressed.  Sad at something, grief at something, yes.  But depression = wallowing.  When some of the apostles were in prison, they were SINGING.  How‚Äôd that make the enemy feel?‚ÄòIn league with the stones of the field . . .‚Äô yep that‚Äôs the spot to be, always with the com channel open.

        Many young men, especially those of European descent, realize that modern society has absolutely nothing to offer them ‚Äì definitely not the things their grandfather had (a wife, a family, a home, a decent job that can provide for all), but not even basic respect and dignity. Many of them are turning to religion, because that is the place so many turn when things seem so desperate. It starts with ‚ÄúChrist is King!‚Äù and ‚ÄúJesus Chad‚Äù memes but memes are memes for a reason ‚Äì they work. Obviously, they‚Äôre not going to find God at the sodomite churches which are just extensions of the state leviathan (and mostly empty anyway ‚Äì why bother when you can just get the same message everywhere you turn?). They find him in traditional churches, Orthodox, Latin Mass, etc. They‚Äôre reading Christian authors who discuss the philosophical and theological underpinnings of the faith. They‚Äôre actively spurning the atheist fedora lords that have dominated online discussion since the early days of the internet. Obviously things are bad, but things are bad all over, and it takes, well, faith. Even Catholics who despair at the current state of the church leadership know that this, too, shall pass.
