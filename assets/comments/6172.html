        You should lay off the Calvinists.  Sore loser RCs still can’t get over the Reformation so I understand why, as a minority in Anglo-Saxonland, you are sore at them.But your scorn is misdirected and honestly you don’t know what you’re talking about.  Progressivism has nothing to do with Calvinism, let alone Protestantism.  Calvinists believe you’re either condemned to hell or elected to heaven and there is little you or I or anyone can do about it.  So they do not bother to “reform” any civil society because it’s pointless.Now Progressivism does remind me of a meddling, foreign, self-appointed parallel power structure with certain of its own claims to being on the right side of history, especially nominated by its founder, and a tin ear to pushback.  So if you want to talk about the Vatican, I’ll happily engage you.  Maybe!Otherwise, good article and good point.  We agree about Mr Jugears.

        No doubt progressives have their faults and so to liberals, republicans, neocons, moderates, extremist, OWS, Tea Party and all the rest. And while we spend all our time finding fault in others because of the political or religious ideology, we fail miserably to question our own with the attention it deserves. by finding fault in others it implies we are right -but are we?  I can only hope that the individual(s) who created this web site and those commenting ponder the passage below.“For better or worse, we are emotionally defined organisms whose choices as to what to believe and what not to are motivated in large measure sure by a relatively simple psychology of reinforcement, security, and comfort. Conventional thinking is the way average people think, not because the majority just happens to think that way but because conformity with convention gratifies many people in terms of reinforcement, security, and comfort. Unfortunately, what we like to think, what we prefer to believe, can be false, misleading, and at times harmful precisely because we resist putting our ideological preferences into question. It is now common practice to refer to “belief systems,” and this is appropriate since beliefs are built on beliefs, layer upon layer, in interdependent, integrated ways that form systems tems that possess a dynamic of their own-resistant to change, chameleon-like so as to accommodate to varying environments of fact and fashion, and structured so as to protect and defend those systems, much as the human immune system is organized to withstand and fight back when challenged by a pathogen. The fortitude and obduracy of systems of belief are their strength but also their downfall. Conservative thinking-adherence to and defense of conventions that are dominant at any particular time-therefore automatically brings with it a limited field of vision and a self-chosen myopia. If any blame can he laid for periods of slowed, nonexistent, or retrograde intellectual and scientific development, for periods of uncreative, sluggish, and at times imperceptible growth, that blame can he placed both on the natural human unwillingness to call into question beliefs that apparently have served well enough in the past and on the deeply entrenched disinclination nation to step outside of the preferred category set. Individuals who are willing to do these things tend to be few, and they should expect to meet correspondingly deeply rooted resistance, which of course indeed they have throughout the past”Steven James Bartlett. Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health (Kindle Locations 126-137). Kindle Edition.Should you ever decide the read this book with undivided attention and the spirit of humility, you will see things in ways you never did before. Ideologies, whether political or religious are man made and therefore imperfect and as long as we cling to one or the other, we are not free. There is much talk about freedom but the freedom FROM and the freedom TO are two different things. If we do not free ourselves FROM our own examined and archaic ideologies we are not free TO create and gain a greater understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.

        You’ve got to believe that Obama wakes up every day with the thought “Now how can I piss off whitey today?”
And you are correct, the revolution, if it comes, will be brief. The Divider in Chief commands all 4 branches of the US military. Unless we can convince them to join the side of the people, we are hopelessly outgunned.

            My counter example would be Iraq 2004-08. About 4-5 million Sunni Arabs (Arabs!) in an area about the size of a New England state and armed with light infantry weapons tied down nearly the entire Army and Marine Corps.  During that time, just about every unit was training for the fight, in the fight, or resting and refitting after the fight.   My guess would be that the services would declare themselves “neutral” for the duration.

            hey Vic P….  sorry to hear that when you woke up the coffee was again cold.  Picture this, 1 million well armed patriotic citizens walking calmly down Pennsylvania avenue to the white house with the sole purpose of tossing the magic negro into the Potomac.  There is not a military on the planet capable of stopping it short of a nuclear blast on the White House steps, also a happy but impractical thought

                One million well armed citizens marching down Pennsylvania Ave to forcefully remove the Divider in Chief without any resistance? Dream on, my friend. Not happening in my lifetime. As boring as this may sound, we have elections for that. Not as glorious and exciting as your dream scenario, but infinitely more practical.
And my coffee was piping hot and delicious this morning, thank you very much.

        Ovomit isn’t a Progressive, he’s a Marxist. His mother was a Marxist, his father was a Marxist, his step-father was a Marxist, his grandparents were Marxist, his mentors and acquaintances/friends were Marxists. He’s just gone out of his way to conceal it as best he can to play to the ignorant and/or the fawning. He’s so obvious, he’s transparent, not black.

        A local letter writer to our newspaper, who is a reliable voice for hard-left progressivism, wrote a letter today explaining that “the peoples of the world” will never tolerate a Trump presidency.
So there! 🙂

            Reminds me of years ago in my country when ‘informed’ people said, loudly, no motorist would ever pay a £1 for a gallon of petrol (gas).
So much for the power of prediction: we in the UK often pay over a pound for a litre, which pushes the gallon price of gas towards the 5 quid mark, and as far as I can see people are willing to pay it.

        Crazy thing about all the whinging from minorities in America is, no political system gives more franchise rights to minorities than the Anglo-Saxon parliamentary system does.Rights to caucus, rights to form political parties, rights to form and own adversarial media companies, rights to filibuster legislation, rights to speak in any commons, along with all the freedoms enshrined in our Bill of Rights, like the right to a trial by jury, etc.,ad infinitum:  but for 10-20% of our nation’s citizens, it’s never gonna be enough.It is futile to try any longer to convince this fraction of our country of their good fortune.  We’ve spent trillions of dollars since LBJ trying to win these hearts and minds and all for naught.Sensing the dead-end their movement has entered, they’ve tried to expand the pool of radicals by drumming-up new rafts of the aggrieved, from gays to Womyn and the “transgendered,” to augment their racialist armies with non-racial recruits.  But the new queer recruits fit in poorly with the strange racial and religious conscripts of the old grievance contingent.The end of their gambit is nigh.  But what are we to do with this frumpy, ever-disgruntled, never satisfied cohort of our country men?  Huckabee’s reminder that planes leave every day for Liberia, Mexico City and parts beyond points the way.  And this fed-up American citizen’d even pay for their one-way ticket.

            This has occurred to me for a while: no matter what someone does, no matter how much money and dedication is poured in, there are some people who just refuse to be happy.
So if every effort made is deemed worthless, then one one may as well do nothing for them at all. They aren’t going to be any less happy and not only does it save the world time and money but, incredibly, it might just focus the malcontent’s minds on all the good things they were so ungrateful for at the time.

            “It is futile to try any longer to convince this fraction of our country of their good fortune. We’ve spent trillions of dollars since LBJ trying to win these hearts and minds and all for naught.”You are missing the point. You win the “hearts and minds” of that community with something called “GibsMeDat”. LBJ understood that in the most profound sense. He presided over a massive expansion of the welfare state that was explicitly designed to hijack 10% of the population’s vote. Most people aren’t aware that before 1963, virtually all black people who bothered to vote, voted Republican. And don’t get me started on the Immigration Act of 1965, which simply added even more Democrat voters to the rolls.“I’ll have those niggers voting Democrat for the next hundred years!” — Lyndon Baines Johnson
