        Those who know me know I’m a real hard-a$$, but hey, I cry nearly every time I hear Kiri Te Kanawa sing.  You wanna make something of it?   Bring it on.  OK, judging from what I heard on the video clips, the main problem I have with Baker is that he is a Big Government Republican.  Now in a blue state like Massamessetts, that’s probably the only way for a Republican to get elected.  But if he wins the election, it will not be a win for Conservatism.  It will be a win for Liberalism-Lite.  I’ll tell you one thing, though, my sister is a Democrat through and through, and she told me she is voting for Baker.  That confession just struck me dumb.

        OMG, sooo glad I moved from Massachusetts 10 years ago. It’s become a caricature of naval-grazing ultra-liberalism.

        Democracy has been called the least worst form of government. Politicians today strive to ensure it is simply the worst by pandering to every shout, whim, sneeze and moan from the ranks in their relentless bid to win votes.

        One curse of democratic societies is that the “smart” fraction become dumbed down themselves in their relentless effort to relate with, manipulate, and contol the stupid and the dependent. Dysfunction then grows on both ends of the genome. The great writers and thinkers of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries did not live in an era of universal suffrage.
