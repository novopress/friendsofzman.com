        Anytime I read or hear about some “climate change” bulls***, I get an almost uncontrollable urge to light a wood burning fire (even in the middle of summer) or fire up a charcoal bbq…

        As the summer approaches, and the impact of rising prices for food and fuel start to bite into Middle American budgets, normie anxiety will accelerate and continue toward a breaking point. Grousing will become more prevalent and worried expressions on people’s faces will be seen everywhere. The pressure is building, and adding to that pressure will be a malaise of defeatism because it appears that no one is doing anything about it. Waiting for November is stupid-on-steroids if the house is on fire today. So everyone is walking on eggshells and waiting for the match to drop.But things change slowly until they change very fast. That is the reality we live in. There is a lot of pent up emotion and frustration waiting for an opportunity to explode. And something will trigger it (likely trivial and completely unexpected) and then it will spread like wildfire. That will be the beginning of the collapse. You don’t want to be in a big city when it happens, or at the very least, get out quickly when it starts.And here is an anecdote to reinforce this point. Everyone knows that I love to bash Bongino for his naivete. Although he is a good man, he routinely preaches non-violence as a mantra. Which will get you killed right quick if facing down a roving gang at your doorstep with just your dick in your hand. Well, this week that changed. On his podcast this week, Bongino publicly notified his audience that if you show up at his doorstep with intent to do harm to him or his family, he will kill you without hesitation or remorse. This affirmation was quite bold and definitive, and very much in conflict with his non-violence crusade. IOW, if Bongino is now getting antsy, methinks the tide is turning and normie may be siding his ass toward the edge of the couch in case he might actually have to stand and roll up his sleeves.

            The logical conclusion to draw from Bongino’s statement is that there are an increasing number of credible threats of violence against his wife and two minor daughters.  He has to decide if he is a man or not.

                I’ve never doubted Bongino’s manhood, courage, or willingness to defend his family. My problem is with his rhetoric. We’re on the verge of an explicit tyranny here in the US and he’s still telling everyone to stand down. Kinda like what that Police Chief in Uvalde did in commanding his officers to stand down at the elementary school massacre. I’ve said previously that the light bulb will go off in Bongino’s head when he, his wife, and two daughters are third in line at the gas chamber door and his youngest looks up at him and asks . . . daddy, what’s that smell?

        “They will need something to distract people, so we will just have to wait and see. Who knows? Maybe they produce something inventive to keep people busy over the summer.”Zelensky in the next 60-90 days is going to…A) Flee to Tel Aviv/London with his Israeli/British passport with all his loot collected as bribes and blame Russia for threatening to try him as a war criminal…B) Get shot in the head by his own Ukrainian military forces and Western media blames Russia…C) Get shot in the head by British or American special forces now protecting him and Western media blames Russia…D) Scream at Biden that his BMW SUV can’t hold all the suitcases stuffed with cash and then die from a U.S. bioweapon and Western media blames Russia.

                Zelensky: Ukraine will be like Israel, not demilitarized like Switzerland after war
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine will not be demilitarized like Switzerland, but a “big Israel.”https://www.jpost.com/international/article-703335
As a Zionist mutant slob… Zelensky has a bigger ‘Israeli’ passport than you think.

        Well, well, Peter Navarro was today arrested, and placed in handcuffs and leg irons by Merrick Garland’s Stasi force. The “insurrection” narrative just got ramped up, big time.
https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2022/06/03/former-trump-official-peter-navarro-handcuffed-and-put-in-leg-irons-by-fbi-joe-biden-state-police-force/#more-233810
Navarro blew off the subpoena from the January 6 committee, and was talking about support of a move to impeach Skidmark Joe. Too much for the Bolsheviks, this getting the story flipped. Roger Stone was just the start, so it would appear.
And not only the narrative has gotten ramped up, but also the concrete installation of a police state. Let the show trials begin.

            Awful. The United States is in the process of de facto surrendering to Putin, so expect the police state appatus to kick into high gear. Even on anyodyne sites like this one, be cautious. We are dealing with monsters who only understand one thing.

            This is their magic solution to the election crisis. “Experts” (Experts!) will certify that “insurrectionists” coupled with Russians have “tainted” the elections, and so will “certify” the “real” winners etc. The Ministry of Truth will be out there seizing bank accounts, property, etc. en masse just like Canada eh? Already the US General heading Cyber Command testified before Congress that A. The US is conducting cyber warfare against Russia in support of Ukraine, and B. “Russians” are meddling in the upcoming elections.This is the pattern: cite authority by “Experts!” and rule by executive order, often in secret by never letting a crisis go to waste. There is simply no way the various groups that pushed Biden upon us will give up any power ever.

        When there’s a new ‘outrage’ (real or woke) almost daily, eventually everyone stops paying attention.  I’m continually amazed at how much people just let slide by them, like water.  When I went to the dentist the other day gas was still the Memorial Day price of $4.14 a gallon.  When I came out about an hour later, the price at the exact same station had gone up to $4.45.  And now it’s generally $4.69 at all the big-name stations (local Walmart still $4.43).  People just shrug their shoulders at this as though it’s an everyday occurrence – which, of course, it is now in AINO.Everyone loves to predict a breaking point, but I really don’t know that anything will rouse the normalcy bias folks from their lethargy.  They still enroll their White children in public schools without taking even a gander at their prescribed books, they still take on thousands in debt to send the average Joe to a ‘good skoo,’ they still donate millions to ensure the poor orphaned chirren of Messican illegals (killed by another Messican illegal) have a guaranteed true-blue ‘murrican dream future.  Yeah, they grumble online a bit, but just wait until they vote the bums out.  That’ll show ’em.

                The wants are implanted in them, irrespective as to the fact it seems almost impossible to undo the imperatives for those reverting to automata.
Its amazing how one can subvert a large section of an entire species to intentional self-destruction by using social primate signaling techniques and linguistic programming to invert the natural impulses.

Not unnatural at all, but it’s amazing how the will to belong is stronger than the will to live for so many. It’s as if there are two kinds of people who might as well be different breeds.

                        Perhaps that is one of those junctures where speciation becomes manifest. The  genetics have  drifted sufficiently far apart that one sees a phase shift. Culture being downstream from genetics, this should be evident.

Maybe something like domesticated animals and how they’d revert in the wild in a couple of generations, or die. The herd is real, and we’re just the ones who resist domestication.

                        @PaintersformsThe closest explanatory I have come across is Julian Jayne’s Bicameral mind. Its not perfect but as a hypothesis it holds a lot of predictive power to what we see around us. The NPC term is the gamer equivalent of the same idea.Essentially a large number of people have reverted to/grow up as a bronze age pre-conscious bicameral human due to schooling/electronic media which is preventing the development of an integrated consciousness, and receive their commanding thoughts externally from electronic media, as early people did from hallucinated voices from statues/hand idols.They are truly automata, are not conscious, are impervious to the real world experience or information outside the authority pathways and will follow without deviation the commanding voices as does a schizophrenic.It also postulates its strongly genetic.

                    I own quite a bit of land in the Kiamichi Mountains of Southeastern Oklahoma (where most negroes would fear to tread).  This is hard-core redneck country.  I am noticing a lot of Texas license plates these days and a local realtor told me 90% of recent land purchases are by Texans.I’m okay with it if these Texans are traditional oldtime Texans.  If they are the outsider liberals that have infested Texas the last 30 years or so,  they are gonna be in for a rude awenking if they run their mouths too much.As a local sheriff once told me, “there’s lots a dead bodies in them forested mountains and ain’t nobody lookin for em.”

Cherokee Nation in Norheastern Oklahoma is beautiful  country.  It is in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains and has lots of great fishing and hunting.
The cost of living is low and the people are easy to get along with if you mind your manners and stay out of their business.
If things get bad enough in California,  you can always return to your parent’s homeland  in Cherokee country and enjoy a pretty good laid back lifestyle.

        “Advocates for so-called “equity based” grading practices, which seek to raise the grade point averages of black students and lower scores of higher-achieving Asian, white and Hispanic ones, say new grading criteria are necessary to further school districts’ mission of DEIJ, or “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice.””
I’m sure it will lower scores for Asian, White and Hispanic students, because no parent who has any care for their child’s education would ever send their kid their. Thus, only the worst White, Black and Asian kids will stay in the school.

            There’s something horribly wrong about parents not caring about sexual deviants teaching children in school, but they suddenly care about grading for some reason. The truth is that grade inflation and cheating is so prevalent in ghetto schools that honest grading can only hurt good students who make honest mistakes every once in a while.

Here are the search results for Oak Park:https://wirepoints.org/?s=Oak+ParkCheck out that they’re madly backtracking this now that they’ve gotten caught. Of course, they show a history of leftist meddling and screwing around with schools so I believe this story is true.Interestingly enough for all their virtue signaling the Karens and Kens make DAMNED SURE nobody from Austin, right next door to Oak Park, come into their town. Guess what demographic makes up nearly 78% of Austin?

            Spingerah:  The lolbertarians already tried that about 20 years ago . . . (or was their goal New Hampshire?  Can’t recall).  Obviously it didn’t work.  More Massholes just moved over and New Yawk Juice like Bernie.  Now Vermont has its share of Messicans and Bantus and is reaping the rewards.Move to some place that doesn’t get mentioned in the news as “White.”  There are various small towns and rural enclaves in numerous states whose overall demographic numbers might not be great, but there are distinct color zones within said states.

                The Free State Project targeted New Hampshire. You could say that it was nominally successful, although their latest cause celebre is changing the zoning laws to allow for “affordable housing”.  So likely it’ll just end up as Massachusetts with low taxes.It might be fun to start a “White State Project”, also targeting New Hampshire, to encourage White Nationalists to move to New Hampshire and buy that affordable housing.I expect there might even be some local sympathy for the project. Libertarians, whether they like it or not, are almost exclusively white, and about half of the libertarians I know went alt-right around 2016. I expect that’s just as true for New Hampshire.

                Hi 3gI don’t know much about anything east of the Missouri River, essentially the northeast.I’ve seen the Atlantic from. The air &amp; waded in morrocco.We are in the American redoubt but even that is being infested by wealthy Californians.The town I was born in now has rainbow flags every where. (Northern Idaho)  nowhere to run. There are even filth in Alaska.Where there is one more follow.Even if it is a Greg Johnson type. I don’t deny being a typical white guy,I am a stereo type, just rather be around other like minded

                    Spingehra:  You’re right, unfortunately – the blight has spread its tentacles almost everywhere.  Which is why – to return, yet again, to one of my hobby horse issues – is why men need to get control of their wives.Undesirable people  need to be made to feel unwelcome.  No neighborly visits, no children’s play dates, no invitations to get togethers.  White people need to relearn the art of social exclusion.  This can be done without any legal ramifications and can lead to solid results.  Minnesota nice may be a  stereotype, but Whites everywhere are far too welcoming – particularly of other Whites who claim to be refugees from the sh&amp;tholes they helped create.

        Today’s podcast got me thinking about deadweight in society and if anyone has actually tried to assess the magnitude of this cohort in an accurate fashion. Try googling “deadweight in society” and you get everything but “worthless parasitic humanoid skating by on the productivity of others.” My guess is that no one will conduct research in this area because the biggest subset of deadweight is probably located within academia. And my fear is that they are now in the majority and that is no trivial thing. So I’ve been strategizing and modeling on how to deal with this issue, but they don’t stampede easily and mostly just get in the way. Any insights or suggestions would be appreciated.

            When the parasites’ demand for resources outstrips the hosts’ capacity to provide them, the system accelerates toward collapse. We are now reaping the whirlwind sowed with the institutional parasitism inaugurated by the Great Society movement and exported by the GAE. TPTB thought they were ensuring peace at home and proxy wars abroad against the Red menace. Their hubris is the proximate cause of our inevitable fall. But the strong, resilient few will adapt, survive and emerge to inherit the aftermath. Be one of those few or, at least, favor their ilk with your resources rather than the doomed.

They were.  It’s the central problem of democracy:  Why would you care what happens 40 or even 4 years down the road when the election or the no-show board appointment and all attendant spoils arenow?  You can’t win with an owner mentality when you’re playing against slum-trash renters.

            “…the biggest subset of deadweight is probably located within academia.”TomA, we are not “dead weight!”  Here’s a story about the last time I explained this with an outsider.We (wife and I) once went to a corporate dinner, big pharma.  Sitting across from us was an associate up the chain (female) who was making conversation with the wife.  She decided that the husband (me) should be included, so she asked, as is typical in these things, to identify myself as to my position up the socioeconomic status chain, i.e., “What do you do?”I replied that “I work at the University”.  She persisted.  “What do you do?”  I replied, “I’m in the Computer Science department.”  She said, “Yes, but what do you do?”Now I admit to being somewhat perplexed as I can’t recall any previous conversations with anyone that probing so I was caught short as to an immediate layman’s response.   How does one explain the grift in a brief sentence or two?  After some thought on the matter I replied—with all the seriousness I could muster, “I think great thoughts!”She responded, “How interesting” and (gratefully) ignored me for the rest of the evening—probably having (rightfully) discerned I did nothing of importance enough to merit further discussion.  😉

                It sounds to me like you are perfectly situated to conduct a study of the estimated size of the deadweight fraction in the US population. As a side note regarding your dinner conversation, I began my career working for one of the largest corporations on the planet (at that time), and I can personally attest that nearly all of middle management in such corporations is premium deadweight.

        The problem with the Outrage of the Week is that they always have to keep upping the ante. People do get freakout fatigue. I know lots of folks who still think covid was real, that it was gonna kill granny, and all that. They didn’t stop believing in any of it; they just got too tired of all the constantly changing “guidance” to care. You can even do a kind of social archaeology on them — you can take their covid views, and plot them against the ever-moving Media goalposts, to pinpoint the exact moment the freakout fatigue set in and they stopped caring.And upping the ante is extremely dangerous, for obvious reasons, but also because all that social anxiety has to dischargesomehow.Covid was a big discharge of social anxiety from the Trump years, but after two years of Biden society is way more tense than ever it was under Bad Orange Man. And yet they keep on ratcheting. That discharge could end up being a Ceausescu moment.

        “I got a complaint about the last show that the intro was too long.”
Well, now that you mention it Z-Man, I have to confess that your podcasts always come across as if they were ENTIRELY intro. Due to your manner of speaking, you never seem to actually talk about what you’re talking about. It’s all intro, all preparation, all leading up to something, and then the hour is over.
Also, you have a curious habit of writing thousands and thousands of paragraphs that are all exactly the same size. You’re like the Hercule Poirot of paragraph writing.

            Z-man has discussed his “style” of writing in the past.  Has a “formula” which structures his essays into pieces (paragraphs)—each of a limited size for expressing a single thought, without much drift or digression.  Keeps his postings, short and understandable to a typical audience.  Nothing wrong with that.  Podcasts are more extemporaneous and flow of thought.  Another format so to speak for a different type of expression.  Nothing wrong with that either.

                This abuse of language is one of their primary weapons.  It’s shocking sometimes just how wide a gap there is between what is said in public debates and what people think the words mean.“White Supremacy” and “White Supremacist” are two fine examples.  People think they know what these words mean. But they don’t mean what they think they mean in the public debate context. People think of David Duke as a “White Supremacist,” but that is the classic definition.  The New-Speak definition is like a cop.  He is upholding “white supremacy” when he enforces the law (even if xi xirself is African American).  Hell, the law itself is a form of “White Supremacy” in New Speak.In public debate, “White Supremacy” actually means things like “if you hear a bump in the night and call the cops, you expect the cops will show up and address the issue and protect you”  This is an often cited example of white supremacy in action.

                    White supremacy is basically coterminous with civilization. Blacks, by and large, cannot behave in a civilized manner and they cannot measure up to the standards of civilization. Rather than turn the spotlight on blacks and their inferiority, the West has chosen to condemn civilization as “white supremacist” and therefore fit only for destruction.
We cannot have both blacks and civilization. We have chosen blacks.

Its very bizarre that a normal self-identity promotion in the countries which are white is even discussed in these terms.
It seems to have come into being as an accepted negative without ever having any definition simply through serious toned repetition in the media  in surrounding negative sentences.

            The left has excelled at changing the world.  Unfortunately, the changes they’ve made are rooted in alogical feelings, acid-trip social theories and pure existential rottenness.  Like x-rays fired out of a high-powered cathode, the resulting changes are entropic rather than homeostatic.
And non-homeostatic change is just another word for cancer.

        Given what a mess the country is in, the only options I see for the rulers are:1. Let Trump win and reinvigorate both the Republicans and the Democrats. We will get a replay of 2016 with as little getting accomplished as them. At least Trump may steer us around WW3 though2. Election fraud was so successful in 2020 they may do it again. Problem with this is Republicans are a little wiser about that but probably not enough to stop it3. There has been talk of Harris not ratifying the election if Trump wins and the House refusing to seat new Republicans because Trump and the Republicans supported insurrection.I think number 3 is the most interesting. Our rulers have grown sick of having to maintain a good standard of living for the middle class and want to sink it like they did the working class. Climate change, Covid,  and Russia Man Bad have all been excuses to do just that as well as get rid of pesky freedoms that crimp the rulers’ style.Will the rulers also get sick of having to maintain the pretense of a two party system rooted in the constitution? They will save a lot of money and aggregation is they just use blatant theft or refuse to let the other side play even if it is only fake opposition

        “Should mere citizens be allowed to own cannons, tanks, and F-16s?!”, they ask indignantly.
Welp, if it’s to protect ourselves from a hostile government, HELL YES

        Biden’s job is to be the focus of peoples’ outrage and anger so that the Obama regime can continue deconstructing the country.  Everyone pretends it is otherwise, just like they pretended the election was legitimate and Covid was a death sentence unless you wore a face diaper.Every ounce of this garbage is giving them cover for massive ballot box stuffing operations which were successfully deployed in 2020.  The purpose of the polls is to help them model how many ballots they will need and where.  They’ll probably have to accept “defeat” to the GOP, but they’ll try to avoid a veto-proof majority knowing that the GOP hates us as much as they do.The thing about the school shootings is that you hear more and more people starting to say out loud that it seems like these murders are planned and carried out by the government through mentally ill people.  The Muzzies are notorious for using retarded and insane people to carry out suicide bombings in shopping markets.Naturally we get called “conspiracy theorists” for awhile, until evidence emerges of Hillary Clinton fabricating the Russia hoax, the FBI actively participating in it, and 2000 Mules stuffing mail in ballot boxes…

        I took classes to get my concealed carry permit in Florida two years ago. Both in my class and in the government office full of other gun license applicants I saw one other person who looked like a Trump voter. Almost everyone I met was a youthful urban minority. If I was a politician gun confiscation would be two words never to come out of my mouth.

            The summer of police and National Guard units literally kneeling in front of BLM rioters as whole city blocks burned in the background hard-setan image into the brain of even the most delicate lefty that the government is not there to protect YOU.
As did the year of “mask up and huddle in place”…except when you’re gathering by the tens of thousands to “protest racism”, because getting Democrats elected is more important than public health.
Rejoice, because those two events set the gun-grabbers agenda back for at least a generation.

        ”  They will need something to distract people, so we will just have to wait and see.”Well, whatever The Literal Meathead is talking about is what they’re going to pull off.Guns see to be the main topic of the day. They’re not going to shut up about that, especially if there is a never ending list of mass shootings which I predict will magically appear. There will be many changes in the shootout story, no pictures or videos proving their narrative, and even a few more video interviews with 2 “daddies” who happen to have the same daughter.Something big is going to happen that will give Joe Blow his excuse to declare a National State of Emergency. The whole edifice is in collapse, and why not speed up the process so they can take over nixing the writ of habeas corpus?Mass shootouts won’t be the deciding factor, so whatever it is will be big and it will happen soon. Gun bans will just be issue #2 for them, when they add a national gun ban on top of their takeover.We are living in dangerous times, and I fear we’re soon going to find out what most can never imagine. Soon in America there will be one day they will tell you that you really never did have any rights. All pretense will be over, and the monsters behind the curtain will emerge. Things will be so bad they will not care who sees them for whom they really are.

            I completely agree with you with everything except your last point. They will tell us we have rights – but that these rights have to be balanced against “The Common Good.” The Common Good of course being whatever perverse desire of theirs that they want to inflict upon the populace.

                That’s how the Canadian Charter of Rights work. We have rights but they can be amended given “reasonable circumstances”.
We have the right to travel freely but because COVID is a “reasonable circumstance” we actually don’t have the right to travel anywhere. Basically you have no rights if the government decides you don’t.
Never negotiate an inch with them because this is what you’ll get.

                    During the Republic, it was the Roman Plebeians who had to pressure the Patricians (oligarchs) to codify the laws, rather than enforcing them arbitrarily.  Without this step, there was no way to seek redress for wrongs, as there was way to contest the legality of Patrician overreach.
History rhymes today, except the oligarchs have figured out a method of enshrining their power behind a stew of weasel words, enforced by a judicial system that’s now part of their club.

            You never had any rights. What you think were your rights were a set of values held by the Virginia planter elite of the 1780s. The Second Amendment exists because it suited elites like George Washinton, who was wealthy, educated, politically powerful, and spent his entire adult life as a surveyor and soldier in the colonial wilderness with a pistol on his hip and a musket in his scabbard. People who believed in the same “rights” that Washington believed in were “dealt with” by 1865 the same way the Feds dealt with Vicki Weaver.Today’s elites are Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Pete Buttigieg. They don’t give a damn about guns or due process or free speech, all they care about is anal, abortion, Israel and affirmative action. Those are your “rights” today.

            Cops are scared to death of arresting minorities.
Nobody cares if a pale face (White, Asian, light-skinned Latino) gets murdered by police.
Unpopular opinion:  most people who die in police custody, no matter what the race, pretty much bring it on themselves.  The Miranda rights trope to KEEP SILENT has been beat into the US population for generations now in all mass media entertainment.
Not getting killed by cops is trivially easy.  Not getting screwed by the District Attorney is more problematic.

        Regarding the voices segment, what’s really irritating is there are people who, through a tragedy of genetics or trauma, do deal with voices saying far worse things than “skip your exam”.  These people have to make a stark choice between mind-numbing benzos or finding a coping mechanism to work in general society.  If they are not able, they are separated from society for their own good and societies.The people on these sites usually are poster people for the “Stop stigma” campaigns, that completely ignore how dangerous and devastating these conditions are.  There are reasons we had mental asylums.Jerks like that woman who fake it for sympathy give a completely upside down view of these conditions.  It’s nasty, dangerous, and needs to be taken seriously by adults.

            I’ve heard from a person who works with those kinds of people those awareness campaigns do more harm than good. People with an actual problem are drowned out by the social retards looking for attention. Kind of like stupid women who falsely cry rape to “raise awareness” so that women “should be believed” and so many times it dissuades legit victims of violent rape from reporting.

            I used to have a quip when folk asked me why I didn’t attend an event or meeting they were expecting me to be.  I’d respond, “I was going to go, but then the voices in my head said to stay home and clean my guns”
I no longer use that retort.  😉

            Have you ever noticed that in nearly all cases when a well-meaning person says you should not judge X because of Y, or many equivalent preaching against stimgas or stereotypes, it overlooks one crucial aspect:Stereotypes are generally true. Stigmas exist for a reason. People are shunned because they are at best a burden, at worst a threat, to healthy people.None of the above is very “Christian.” And, I’ll admit many of the marginalized are there through no fault of their own (e.g. mental illness). But that doesn’t change the fact that they are dead weight on the rope.It’s great when a Samaritan can truly aid the man in the ditch. But in the real world, there is a never-ending supply of hapless victims awaiting rescue. Every so often, just for variety, is a decoy set up to rob and kill the unwary do-gooder. 🙁

        At this point the only thing that’ll bail this administration out is another tidy false flag attack that we cannot ignore.After the Urvalde shooting peters out, I’m thinking they’ll resort to a small nuke in one of the Dem’s failed cities like Chicago or Detroit.  It can be blamed on ‘Russia’ or ‘MAGA supremiscists’ or whoever.Another bioweapon release is likely, too.  But they’ve played that card already so I expect they’ll choose a Hail Mary nuclear play this time.  They can cash in on the Reconstruction Projects and real estate deals later, too.There are too many reputations at stake in their project’s success now.  There is too much money invested, and for most, there simply is no going back.Forward, Comrades!

            “At this point the only thing that’ll bail this administration out is another tidy false flag attack that we cannot ignore.”I keep thinking “Boy, we haven’t heard from the adherents of the Religion of Peace lately, have we?” The problem is: Say you blow up a train or a bus. That means you’re in a Blue Zone and citizens of the target area would want to prevent a “backlash” and lay themselves prostrate and beg forgiveness. The rest of the country would think “Serves you right for living there”.The nuke idea crossed my mind too.I suspect they’ll go with the Old Favorites and we’ll have another round of “Mostly Peaceful” demonstrations. 🙄

            I’m thinking—from prior experience—that it might not be heat, per se. Sometimes nervous posturing, as in standing at attention, causes a failure to breath correctly, contributing to the fainting.  I’ve seen it at weddings with groomsmen and bridesmaids.

            When I was in the military, I heard of isolated cases, yes. But in Basic and a few times in permanent party (e.g. brigade change of command ceremony, many hundreds of service members), I neither saw nor heard of no such incidents.
Your explanations do not convince me. There is something going on there. Hand-picked military who must have drilled for such duty and three fall out? Normal? No way.

        “Ukraine was supposed to be the main topic, but that is now joining gas prices, food shortages and inflation on the list of forbidden topics.”The USA is looking more and more like a failed state and probably most Americans can sense this at some level. Biden is just another manifestation of this. Caligula’s horse would be more competent. As you described him last year, he’s the death mask of the dying regime. Or as you described him elsewhere, he’s the Konstantin Chernenko of the USSA. Now I know what it must have felt like to be a Russian in 1990.

Yes, yes I certainly have the God-given senses to “sense” it every time, in a suburb of a major shitlibopolis, my vehicles are rattled to pieces by potholes. And when I weave around massive craters, while keeping an eye out for our local, glorious strength behind the wheels of their out of state plated cars, crossing the center line as they stare bovinely ahead.

            We are falling apart up here in Canada too. Our head NDP leader – Jagmeet The Pajeet – literally gets swarmed and mobbed by angry voters everywhere he goes and the cops have to rescue him and take him away before they tear him to shreds. Turdo needs that gun ban because at the rate he’s going, somebody is going to shoot him… and the little cack sucker will deserve it too.Would it be such a bad thing if our countries balkanized? I dunno about you Yanks, but I haven’t got a jot of patriotism left in me today. If Canada is defined by Morontario and Queerbec – I could part the road between us and sleep well at night. That country doesn’t work, and I want to be part of one that does….

Canada will have this in place without meaningful pushback.
The only way this tried and tested ratchet fails will require a large portion of society to reject the legitimacy of existing govt by force. That seems a long way off.

                    Agree w trumpton on this one. Simply because people have become so assimilated and repeat what they’re told. The “gun show loophole” is 100% truth to believers. They don’t dare to question this or any other talking point.
I think people in general are pessimistic, but the majority think the country will just keep plugging along with little to no change – and they’re okay with it.

                        The end goal is the voluntary “abandonment” of firearms by making them too costly/dangerous to use or even possess.You won’t give up your firearms, I won’t either, but what about your children—or grandchildren?  Imagine a series of laws so draconian that you can’t openly use your firearms, nor buy parts or ammo (including components for reloading).In short, your firearm is a useless liability.  You’ll never have that range day with the grandchildren’s first “22”.  The culture—proper culture at least—is not passed on.  Hell, even today we see stories of widows dragging their husbands firearm “collection” to the local sheriff for “proper” disposal.On the brighter side, it is a truism that the Lefties *always* over reach—and if past predicts future—will attempt outright confiscation rather than wait the generations needed to destroy the “gun”culture.

                        I often wonder if the more creative, engineering types of our population will develop new means of personal self-defense in the light of diminishing gun rights.  We didn’t get flying cars but perhaps we’ll get force fields and other sci-fi fantasies (said half-facetiously) as our rights are more and more stripped away.  For every sword there is a shield…

                        They don’t need you to give them up.  They will simply make them illegal to have, but let you keep them hidden away.  The government doesn’t care about your guns as long as they’re hidden in the attic or buried in your back yard rusting away.
The “gotcha moment” comes when you have to blow away a couple of jogger home invaders.  Then you get hit with 5 or 6 federal gun charges and disappear into the prison system for life.

                    My understanding is that when Canada banned “assault weapons”, the weapon surrender to the government rate was under 5%.
The handgun thing isn’t confiscation.  It’s just a huge grandfather clause.
Not happy with it, of course.  Slippery slope and all that.  But it could be much worse.
Besides, what’s the point of having weapons if you don’t     Have the will to .

                        The black market in guns, ammo, and body armor will flourish. And probably it will come to be professionally run by the cartels. And then, just as in Mexico, enforcement will come ro be seen by the police as suicide.
An enviable situation? Hardly, but this may be the shape of things to come.

            Firearms aren’t going away, and there are already more firearms than citizens in the US currently, plus more rounds of ammunition than was expended in WW2. Faux legislation is just harassment and virtue-signaling to the Prog base, who sleep better at night thinking that it’s actually disarming their neighbors and keeping them safe from future retribution. But the real reality is that this legislation just drives more firearm purchases by people getting more antsy about a potential collapse. County sheriffs know that sending out deputies to gun grab just results in dead deputies, and big city PDs would have to send out SWAT teams 24/7 to attempt confiscation without taking lots of casualties. Make no mistake, the Cloud People would love to use this technique to accomplish white guys killing white guys, but there are better ways to dissuade gun grabbing than needless killing. Quench your anger and anxiety by building a 3D printer in your garage. The zero receiver is easier than you think. Do something tangible.

        “Biden is about as popular as rectal cancer. The reason is incompetnace.”I think you meant “incontinence”.  Anyway, funny how we now seem to be on a rotating news cycle of war, disease, racisms, and mass shootings. I don’t know what else could grab eyeballs. An Impeachment? Economics is boring. I don’t see the energy/food prices whipping the media-consuming public into a social-media frenzy. Plus that blows back on the current administration. Riots or rebellion might be viewed as anti-Biden and therefore a right-wing rebellion, and those are not allowed. So I think we’re in for a rotating cast of Current Things like Marvel movie releases and hopefully more and more people will start ignoring them. Like Marvel movie releases.

                Also, I wonder how much armtwisting comes into play. Don’t you think the services are keeping dossiers on everyone halfway important in European politics, and then up, collecting and documenting dirt on them in every single European country?
And because all European actors know it, those few who are not voluntarily totally onboard with the woke-left agenda to begin with, or who are not simply thieves without a conscience, meekly go along anyway, anticipating consequences if they don’t.

                In only about 4 months, it is going to start getting cold again in the Northern Hemisphere. I wonder what Western Europe is planning to use for heating next season? In the meantime, there are other needs for the oil and gas that has gone missing. Industrial shutdowns? Power stations?
Virtue signalling makes one feel wonderful; I’ve even done it myself a few times in my life. But I wonder if the Progressives of Europe have really thought this one through.

                    Yes they have.
The lack of heating is intentional, as is no transport, no food etc. Its the great reset change here and now, and the deaths of millions of people is a price the parasites are more than happy to pay for a ride on the corporate jet and an invite to drinks with the controlling faction.
Look at Ukraine and the massive arms supplies. The EU leaders are happy to waste thousands of men’s lives just to have a few minutes attention in the news.

            I don’t think it will work a second time in guilting normal whites.  Too many are starting to wake up.  Looks at the comments for this normie take getting completely wrecked.  Twitter isn’t real life, but it can be a bellwether.

Conservative pundits are finding their usual talking points are not working, or making the argument so poorly they are subtly supporting our viewpoints.

                And this Jesse Kelly clown is what passes for edgy and woke in the Twitter cesspool, sort of like Kurt Schlichter. Never daring to step beyond the blank slate egalitarian barriers, but always posing as tough-minded and courageously blunt.
