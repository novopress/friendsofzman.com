                    “House Carpenter” performed by Jean Ritchie and Doc Watson is really interesting, eerie song — was immediately reminded of it when listening to Black Sabbath’s “N.I.B.”

            One thing that really peeves me off is when immigrants come in and start trying to lecture me about American history.One of the Chinese guys I work with got an earful one day when he tried to give the rundown on how badly the natives had been treated by white people.I told him he had his head up his ass and that respect for “Indians” is something that runs pretty deeply in TRUE American culture – and especially among the “dirt people” (I didn’t use that term because he wouldn’t understand).  He kept insisting.  I told him he was full of shit and then asked him who was going to know American history better – the guy who was actually born here and whose forefathers go back generations – or the guy who just came here and who’s English I can barely understand?Then I told him: ” Let me start telling you all about Chinese history”.That finally shut him up.

                Yeah. It’s rich for a Han to pop off about right and wrong or the value of human life. Their entire history is one insanely large bloodbath after another.
Or you could just say “Taiwan” and watch him loose his sh!t.

        The elimination of whites is the natural – and moral – endpoint for today’s dominant ideology. Just follow the simple logic:1. Unequal outcomes among the various races (not that there is such a thing, but whites believe in “race”) is caused by racism – importantly, both conscious and unconscious.2. These unequal outcomes are literally killing blacks and Hispanics* via high crime rates, higher infant mortality and disease, i.e. racism doesn’t just lead to less material wealth; it harms its victims physical and mental health even to the point of killing them.3. Whites, whether they know it or admit, are responsible for racism.4. Despite 50 years of government programs and education, whites refuse to give up their racism. (Even whites who believe that they aren’t racist are, in fact, racist. Their racism is unconscious.) The proof that whites continue to be racist is the continued unequal outcomes.Conclusion: Racism is evil and must be destroyed. Whites are the cause of racism. Whites either are refusing to stop being racist or are incapable of not being racist. Therefore, whites are racism and thus must be destroyed.Democratic politicians are simply following the logic of our times to its inevitable conclusion: Whites must be eliminated, and if not eliminated, must be brought to heel so they can do no harm.* What about Asians, you say. Well, whites seem to subject Asians to less racism than blacks and Hispanics because whites are racist even in their racism. And as you can see with the success of Asians, blacks and Hispanics could be far, far more successful if only whites would let them.

            This is a boldly rational analysis, but you cannot stop there. Given that being born a member of the Caucasian race is both evil and an existential threat to all other components of humanity, then the emerging vibrant political leadership is honor-bound to implement a “final solution” for the good of all mankind. How will they accomplish this goal? When will they begin in earnest? Will the doomed go quietly and meekly stand in line at the entrance to the gas chambers?

                We’ll start to see the outlines of all of that in a decade or two. I hope that we’ll fight back, and maybe we will. But I have to say, the behavior of whites in South Africa haunts my dreams.

                    Human denial Citizen.  I’ve seen it, I’ve read about it, I’ve done it myself.  The Whites in SA are living in squalor at a size/proportion that was never remotely approached before apartheid.  Yet, the remaining Whites find their few occupational positions left to them lucrative (while they last) and continue to prop up the SA economy.  A Faustian bargain wherein they hope to survive, but in reality will only cause them to be the last eaten.

                    In the soviet union the problems for the Kulaks started in about 1918 and by the 1930s they were being “dealt with” in earnest.  If we use the base line of 2008, when the anti-white rhetoric really started to  ramp up then we may not have a decade.

        Hey, America had a good run of seventy years or so, just took some time to really grind it into the ground. Look at all the great or near great nation states for millennia. There is an unmistakable arc of rise, complacency and fall. Just like what human beings go through in their lifetime.
I think we need another Tea Party to fix this, then for sure we will right the ship.(ok, sarcasm if you are not sure).

        Why do they hate us? Well, because they’ve always hated us. Very broadly speaking, the races have always hated each other. Different races can’t live together peacefully in the same polity. Rarely have, rarely will. Just the way it is.The “genius” of leftism, such as it is, is to justify, provide cover for, and evensanctifythe most vicious impulses of human nature, including race hate.One suspects that even without the “multiple foundings” context, Harry Jaffa, Eric Foner, Cathy Young, and Max Boot (*loud cough*) would have come up with some other theory about why white people need to be disempowered, humiliated, and eradicated.In truth, there is a bit of a “hate gap”–on analogy with the “missile gap.” Whites, a temperate bunch these days, may not like playing the game, but just as some people may not have liked playing the “arms race” but had to in order to avoid annihilation, we may have to catch up in the “hate race” in order to survive.

            Yes, races, and to a lesser extent ethnicities, have always been somewhat mutually antagonistic, if not hateful toward one another. However, the far more interesting question is why approximately one third of whites have become traitors against their own people.
Incidentally, there used to be an academic journal called “Race Traitor”–perhaps it still exists–created by a certain Noel Ignatiev. Its motto was “Treason against the white race is a service to humanity.”

                Yeah, getting white people to take their own side, as the Zman and many of our guys correctly point out, is job number one. If understanding how white people are brainwashed into hating their own guys can help usundoit, then it’s definitely an important subject.
(P.S. “Race Traitor,” wow, that’s really on the nose. No pun intended. I wonder if the readers were primarily white or Jewish, and if the readers were made consciously aware of the journal’s Jewish provenance?)

                    My guess is the overwhelming majority of its readers were white–most academic AWRs are white, after all–but that they were certainly not made aware of Ignatiev’s Jewishness. But with a name like Noel Ignatiev, that was probably an open secret.

        Z, do you genuinely believe the race-traitors hate us because of the Atlantic slave trade? The Germans, Swedes and Dutch are some of the most virulent race-traitors, and their role in the slave trade was peripheral at best. I think there must be something else going on here. And part of that something is WWII and the Holocaust. Genuine race-treason proceeded apace after the conclusion of those events and accelerated to warp speed in the 60s.Now the interesting question is, why among all peoples on the planet, do only whites flagellate themselves into submission for historical failings while studiously suppressing their manifold historical achievements? The white race seems to have some sort of unique suicidal neurosis. I believe this is one function of white exceptionalism, and if we don’t cure it, it could be our undoing.

            Slavery has NOTHING to do w this. Im sick and tired of hearing about slavery. Slavery had to go, it would have gone regardless of the civil war, it went. It is quite remarkable that it is not an entirely peripheral topic today.
Now as to ‘race treason’, it is the natural product of having ruled the world for 500 years, as whites have. They think they are so ‘magically’ superior that they dont need to look after their interests. It is actually astounding conceitedness masked as benevolence.

                Even though U.S. citizens did not vote to allow people of all race and ethnicities to be allowed in to the U.S. with the 1965 immigration act, this was our Congress’ doing, for the most part white Americans welcomed people of color in to the States with open arms and a spirit of generosity, looking forward to sharing the country’s prosperity and living in harmony with people from different cultures, religions, races. Sadly, our schools have taught that whites are bad, intolerant, privileged. That we who tolerate so much that differs from our own successful heritage, are bigoted  intolerant racists. The school teaching is reinforced by our popular culture and government. We now see people from India or Laos or Ghana living contentedly in our built-by-whites western world and these people from all over the world have had their minds shaped by our own western schools to see white people — the very people who built this country that welcomes them — as villains who need to be exterminated. When you add this teaching to their own innate tribal preferences, the environment becomes detrimental to white people. They are convinced the goose that lays the golden eggs needs to be killed.

                    You say, “Sadly, our schools have taught that whites are bad”.
This is the same thing as saying “shots rang out,” or “a gun went off,” or “the streets are engulfed in crime.”  You are leaving out the agency.
Our “schools” taught nothing of the sort, until they were taken over by Jews.  Then, mysteriously “our” schools (heh) began teaching Whites are bad.  No, it is not our schools that teach this, it is Jewish mind poison which teaches this.

                            Jews are heavily involved in crafting the disgraceful teachers’ education curriculum as well as the school books and materials that our children of all ages take in, to their own detriment. Teachers unions, school books and curriculum, school testing and admissions, removal of every last bit of Christianity — these are things Jews are heavily involved in creating and implementing. Show me any field in the U.S. with any kind of importance and I’ll show you Jews right there in the middle of it, at the top usually.

                                    Normie: Wake up, lamb chop. Here’s just an example. Take Susan Glasser:“Glasser, who served as founding editor of the award-winning POLITICO Magazine and went on to become editor of POLITICO throughout the 2016 election cycle, has reported everywhere from the halls of Congress to the battle of Tora Bora. The former editor in chief of Foreign Policy magazine, she spent four years traveling the former Soviet Union as the Washington Post’s Moscow co-bureau chief, covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and co-authored “Kremlin Rising: Vladimir Putin and the End of Revolution,” with her husband, New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker. They’re now working on a biography of former Secretary of State Jim Baker.“Glasser joined POLITICO in 2013 after several years as editor-in-chief of the award-winning magazine Foreign Policy, overseeing its relaunch in print and as a daily online magazine. During her tenure, the magazine was recognized as a finalist for 10 National Magazine Awards and won three of the magazine world’s highest honors.“Before that, Glasser worked for a decade at The Washington Post, where she was a foreign correspondent, editor of the Post’s Sunday Outlook and national news sections and political reporter. She started at the Post in 1998 as deputy national editor overseeing the Monica Lewinsky investigation and subsequent impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and later served as a national political reporter, covering the intersection of money and politics.“Prior to the Post, Glasser worked for eight years at Roll Call, the newspaper covering the U.S. Congress, where she rose from an intern to be the top editor. A graduate of Harvard University, Glasser lives in Washington with Baker and their son. She serves on the boards of the Pew Research Center and the Harvard Crimson student newspaper and is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution.”https://www.politico.com/magazine/contributor/susan-b-glasserSusan Glasser’s husband, Peter Baker:“The New York Times announced today that Jerusalem Bureau Chief Peter Baker is being recalled to Washington DC to cover the Trump White House less than four months after he arrived in Jerusalem. Baker had covered the Obama White House for The Times and earlier than that the George W. Bush and Clinton administrations for The Washington Post.“In a Facebook post Baker and wife Susan Glasser of Politico ascribed his about-face to the “Trump effect””https://mondoweiss.net/2016/12/times-already-israelpalestine/Susan Glasser’s parents:Lynn S. Glasser + Stephen A. GlasserLegal Entrepreneurs“The Glassers are the creators of important educational, publishing, and business development concepts which have been highly successful over the past three decades. The Glassers have started and sold three businesses in the legal industry. They founded Sandpiper Partners LLC, Clifton, N.J., in 2005.“The Glassers have led the way in innovative business management and substantive law education in the legal field.  Sandpiper runs more than 50 events a year for clients on many aspects of the business of law and substantive law topics.  Sandpiper also organizes and sponsors the annual Global Law Firm Leaders Conference in London and briefings on legal market trends in New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.“At Glasser LegalWorks, which they founded in 1995, they initiated and ran a series of trailblazing courses including The CIO Forum, The Executive Director and CFO Forum, The Law Firm Leaders Forum, The Marketing Partner Forum, The Practice Group Management Forum, and numerous other institutes attended by thousands of law firm managers and attorneys every year. They have organized more than 2,000 conferences, seminars, and institutes. They developed the first Executive MBA program for law firm managers at SUNY Stony Brook University College of Business.“This dynamic duo has published more than 800 books in the legal and business fields, and more than 100 newsletters, many of which they have created. They started the Legal Times newspaper in Washington, D.C., which they sold with their investors to American Lawyer Media.“In 2004 the Glassers and their investors sold Glasser LegalWorks to the largest company in the field, West/The Thomson Corporation (now Thomson Reuters).  The Glassers also have been co-presidents of Prentice Hall Law &amp; Business, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster; and Law &amp; Business Inc., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, publishers.  Stephen Glasser holds a J.D. degree from the University of Michigan Law School and a B.A. cum laude from Colgate University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Lynn Glasser has a B.A. from Chatham College.  They are both listed in “Who’s Who”.  The Glassers serve on numerous nonprofit boards.”https://www.sandpiperpartners.com/principalsAnd this is just one Jewish-American family. Simple research would reveal a whole lot more of this.

                    Ursula, you are too harsh.  I don’t even think they have a concept of a “golden goose”.  Prosperity is like magic, it can be summoned at will.  If someone else, such as Whites, have it all, then getting rid of the Whites will allow them more of it.

                I’ve said for a long time that whites remind me of the couple of trust fund kids that I’ve met. These people were actually pretty bright and could have been happy, successful people if born to different circumstances. Instead, they floundered about looking for meaning because they never had to fight for anything. Naturally, they looked upon their grandparents or even great grandparents with contempt and shame because they stole money from the poor workers.
Whites are the trust fund race of the world.

                        Unearned wealth.  Wherever you notice this, the odds are great no good will follow.  Whether a lottery winner, an NBA draft pick (yes, that is earned somewhat) or a trust fund kid.Indeed, we don’t even need to be that rich that we have trust funds.  Simply being raised in the typical White household today seems enough.  Children are spoiled and very often have never had to earn a dime of their sustenance.On the annoyance end, are the losers we hear of that live in their parents’ basement.  On the dangerous end, are the AOC’s who seek power and authority in Congress.

                Interesting hypothesis in your second paragraph. However, failure to look out for one’s own interest is one thing; actively campaigning for the destruction of one’s own people is something else altogether. And the latter position is the default of white Leftists.

            why among all peoples on the planet, do only whites flagellate themselves into submission for historical failings while studiously suppressing their manifold historical achievements?
Because, for the moment, they can afford to.  That bill is quickly becoming due, but old habits die hard.  Pelosi will soon learn when AOC replaces her as speaker.

            Ostei Kozelskii said: “I think there must be something else going on here. And part of that something is WWII and the Holocaust. Genuine race-treason proceeded apace after the conclusion of those events and accelerated to warp speed in the 60s.” Absolutely. Plus a log list of other things the left has been pounding away at for ever.  Imperialism, slavery, class struggles and the Bourgeois industrial complex etc. It was all White peoples fault. And you right. The 1960s saw a marked increase in leftist social philosophy being taught is American schools. Here’s the grand daddy of critical theory, Max Horkheimer.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Horkheimerof course all the people from the frankfurt school played their roles. Not to mention the freaking KGB and their programs of social and cultural demorelisation. The long leftist march through the Western institutions has been a resounding success. But getting back to WWII. Here’s a guy called ” Black Pigeon Speaks.” On Youtube. He’s talking about the fashining of a new foundation myth after the war. ( This bird is not always spot on, but I think he does a good job with this particular vid.)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94zz2oWCv20

            Its called Christianity. Original Sin. Born guilty, self loathing constantly inculcated….for two thousand years. Gets in your genes. And, of course, the Aristotelian notion that heaven and earth are separated by an unbridgeable gulf, the perfect above, the ever flawed below. Redemption is impossible. In a word, Don Juanism.

“Whites enslaved others the least.
Whites enslaved others for the shortest amount of time.
Whites ended slavery around the world.
Only whites are blamed for slavery.
Trying to save the world is destroying whites.
You know it.

            The truth is that the colonies, and then the US, were a backwater of the Atlantic slave trade, for the simple reason that slave mortality in the production of tobacco and cotton was a mere fraction of that of producing sugar cane.  The numbers of slaves imported into Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and Brazil, the main slave markets, dwarfed the numbers sent to the US.  Not that WOKE history is ever interested in these inconvenient details.

            Its white women.  Conservative men boycott voting when they dont like the candidates.  White women arrive to vote religiously for whoever promises free abortions. With more prosperity in society come more rights for women, and in turn, more power.  A book called “the female brain” makes it pretty clear that women desire a masochistic range of emotional experiences.  The more power women have in society, the more masochistic, unfortunately.  Imagine approaching a group of chimpanzees and teaching the females how to use guns.  The whole order will be in chaos.  Thats what political power for women is like, and its happened in many societies.  Maybe this time we’ll document it.

            Phenotype is H U G E. I don’t think people understand how big of a deal this is. They are bitterly envious of these traits because it took tens of thousands of years of human evolution to produce them, and guess what? Only ‘whites’ (Euro, Slav, etc) can produce these traits. Imagine the cogdis that produces in so many people? This is why (((they))) are constantly pushing for race mixing, they want the entire world to be some shade of sh1t brown and the scary part is, it is working -quite- well.I think people who don’t interact with minorities regularly don’t understand the burning hatred about this most of them possess. That is why the ‘Beckys’ finally had to be brainwashed with 24×7 indoctrination over decades to get them to hate themselves. It is pure evil.

                    Amazingly, there’s a lot of truth to this. A lot of the hatred stems from the fact that, no matter what they do, they will never be white, and they know it.

                    @WhitneyThat might play a part in it but I think most of the anger comes from that their men desire the white female along with all other races of men but black women get stuck with only other black men wanting them…That’s where the rage comes from…

                        OK. That’s true,  it generally is only black man that want black women but what is one of women’s most noticeable traits? Hair.  And pretty much all men talk about loveing long hair. They talk about running their fingers through it. Black women do not have long or touchable hair and it sucks for them because they’re the only race that has such terrible hair.

                    Whitney:  The hair is the biggest part of it, but not all of it.  That’s why every celebrity Negress you see has had a nose job and bleaches the hell out of her skin.  I also recall reading on the Daily Mail about one American Negress who had surgery (somewhere in Asia I think – illegal in the US) to permanently change her eye color to blue.  Add in the bleached “weaves” (subcon hair sold by Koreans) and then they all proclaim they’re black and beautiful.  Jealousy is a huge component of their hatred.

                    That’s the reason given for their dislike of swimming, too.  It’s about the hair.  Look at US Olympic swim team (women) — nary an AF-AM to be seen; I seem to remember a black male on one of the relay teams — which almost lost! — several Olympics back.

        White people are hated by everyone (even modern whites) because everyone (especially modern whites) hates Christ.  The fact that white = Christian for almost 2,000 years is the missing piece of the puzzle. In Christ, nations grow strong and beautiful over the generations as their individual gifts mature and become sanctified.  A Christian nation blesses the world. Hence modern prosperity.
The most wretched nation is always the one who used to be God’s people.

            Picking up the cross and following. Also known as responsibility. God was mad at Cain because he could do better and was slacking off. Also known as living up to responsibility. Jesus taught the perfect Hero’s Journey. The perfect example of sacrifice to achieve the goal. Responsibility.— so, I completely agree, Red.

                Personally, I thought of it less as slacking and more trying to do it his own way, make up his own rules. There’s a possibility in my mind that it was initially a teaching moment, “You both gave your offerings and I respected won, take note.” But then Cain had to get all hurt that his way wasn’t as good. Resentment against the better man, right there at the beginning.

                God demanded the sacrifice of an unblemished lamb from His worshipers, because it was a foreshadowing of the sacrifice He planned to make of Himself–His Only Son, Jesus–on the Cross.  God rejected Cain’s sacrifice because it was a false token, one that pointed away from the eventual Sacrifice, and as such was worthy of damnation.  The entire Old Testament is a foreshadowing of the New.  Any other interpretation is flawed.  God chose Abraham and his offspring to be the lineage of the Messiah Christ; once the Messiah came, the reason for chosen-ness was eliminated, but since God cannot renege on His promises, the line of Abraham remains to fulfill the prophesied future, as outlined by Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel and the other prophetic scriptures, culminating in the eventual return of The King as Jesus Himself foretold, and laid out in detail (albeit using veiled and allegorical language) the Book of the Revelation.  Or so I believe.  Maranatha.

            Disagree on this one.
If they hated Christians, you would see destruction of Mexico, the Philippines, Jamaica, etc.
Instead, we only see destruction of white nations and peoples.
There is clearly something more to this puzzle than just “anti-Christian”.
Though, I do believe that whites are uniquely able to actually live out the Bible. Mexican drug cartels, for instance, are also “Christian” but obviously do not follow the Bible very well.

        Re: the “anti-Semites,” it’s not a NAA-SALT to say that the vast majority of A-S’s do not believe there is a monolithic, overt, express, deliberate and centralized Jewish conspiracy to wreck White culture.  This depiction is a straw man and a sop to philo-Semites.Those who believe in Jews under their beds are the exception, not the rule.  As MacDonald very judiciously and objectively lays out in his works, Jews have evolved a combination of genetic and cultural traits which predispose them to insularity, ethno-chauvanism/supremacy and high levels of out-group distrust expressed aggressively (albeit often pass-agg when necessary due to disparity in numbers/power).  The long history of similar complaints and responses by diverse host populations to their alien presence suggests not a “cabal” or “conspiracy,” but rather a set of evolved social behaviors.We don’t waste time on Dis-Right blogs worrying about Paul Kersey or RamZPaul’s “anti-Negroism” for pointing out the obvious proclivities Africans as a population have for crime, infidelity and other R-selection excesses.  We don’t reflexively NABALT when Sailer calls out Bindis for declaring Brahmin supremacy every time someone gives one a platform.  I’m tired of the Chosen having special privileges even when it comes to calling out the self-evident fact that wherever Poz is found, Jews are involved.  Chicken-egg, causation-correlation, whatever, it’s something worth “noticing,” and we need not and should not apologize for noticing.It’s not my fault they’re mixed up with every White-negative cause on what they see as Planet Zion, it’s theirs.  Jews, I’ll stop noticing when you stop the (((tricks.)))  Self-police already.  Until then, eyes wide open.

No, they just can’t do civilization.The Army limits recruitment to IQ numbers 83+, because below that they can’t train the person to do anything useful.If your population has an average of 85, almost half of your people are useless.The Talented 10% do just fine.I used to be an egalitarian. I grew up in the ’70s with the anti-racist theme in my house, . I lost interest in helping others in the ’90s with the advent of open hatred of whites at that time.They will never ever be wealthy as a people. The best they can ever do is Detroit or the lovely Baltimore.The Talented 10 live elsewhere.What they do have is violence. Dumb and violent. If there is a way to organize against that, I am looking for an answer. There is an answer, because our ancestors got us here through much heavier burdens and completely without tools, by our standards.But to this thread: “Intrinsic” white racism is just I.Q.

        Yup.  Completely agree with the ZMan.  They hate you.Fortunately or unfortunately we were once members of the Episcopal Church.  Of course the church and most parishioners skewed leftist.  The official view of the diocese and the parish priest was that white privilege existed and had to be eradicated, which meant the eradication of whites and any semblance of white society.  The loathing of whites (by whites) from the pulpit and pews was something to behold.  60 year-old grandmothers preaching the destruction of jobs, education, and opportunities for their children and grandchildren while their emasculated husbands nodding along during mass was actually quite bizarre and quite terrifying.Exciting times ahead.

            Same here.    At one time the “Big Tent” meant just that.  Parishes sorted accordingly.  Then came the Marxist “Long Marchers.”   Now it’s “anything goes”  and I’m supposed to pretend that they’re upholding the Faith?  No.

            Fred;The Episcopalians you describe are that way because of *apostasy*.  You are very right to want nothing to do with them.  St Paul commands it, after all.If you know the Scriptures, then the Bible is and should be your source of moral authority.  Then you can reject with confidence the claims of those folk you describe above.BTW, getting to know the Scriptures is the very best answer to most of the JQ stuff that’s floating about.  The damage has mostly been done by YT meekly accepting the claims to moral authority of The Cloud, some of whom are also members of you-know-what.  This happens because YT lacks confidence and the Cloud Folk are clever and arrogant bullshyters.OTOH, if you know your Bible then you can reject their claims and schemes with self-assurance.

        The fact that left hates white people should be painfully obvious by now. But for many it is not.The fringe left is easy to mobilize. Envy and covetousness are powerful drivers for the invaders and POCs. And yes, hating whitey is obviously the path to success; the new real americans dream.But what is less obvious to me is the myopia of the goodwhites, who seem incapable of seeing how this will end for them.How does a white prog male think his precious white son will be treated when he is a minority and yet still and evil white male? How does no connect the dots, see that he is complicit in his own demise?Meanwhile. Dissecting the impetus of leftist hate has been a pointless exercise of the egghead right since forever.The right seems content to accept the premise that white people are bad and that our claim to this nation is illegitimate.They clinch their fists and fiercely debate the severity of our sins so we can calculate the fines and ‘put this all behind us’. How progressive.We have been arguing over the toll rates and excise taxes for white sins for decades. And yet the hate has only grown.The problem is that left and right agree that whites are responsible for everything bad ever. So whites shed their skins and become vanilla consumers, like stateless nomads in their own nation.Without identity or a history or a nation, the right only knows how to appeal to the demands of the left. To keep the psychotic petulant child from burning the house down while the sleep.Asking the left for permission to exist is just gay. Of course they need us to exist. To pay. And that seems to be enough for the right.The right seems to get meaning out of paying while the left gets meaning out of cashing those checks, which of course only fosters more disdain and contempt for the right. Like so many camwhores and sugar babies extracting from their johns.Its pointless to try to understand the hate from the leftist perspective.Best to focus on two things: white self-loathing and guilt; and when and why whites abandoned their positive identity in favor of a negative, non-identity.If whites hate themselves its a lot to expect from others to feel any different.If whites refuse to own, cultivate, and protect their identity it is a lot to expect from others to do it for them in any way other than as a negative identity to be bludgeoned into submission.As the marketing sloots say: Own your brand or the market will.

            Lefty whites are trained to hate themselves.  And for even the white normies, any inkling of any sort of white identity may as well be the forbidden zone from the Planet of the Apes.  No one is allowed to go there, but no one really knows why.  It just is.  That is the taboo that we must break.

        Race is incidental to this.  This is a class struggle among whites.  Rich whites against poor whites, city whites against country whites.  College educated whites vs trade school whites.  This hatred of “bad whites” by “good whites” is a recognition that only white people are capable of making life choices.  Non-whites, in their eyes, don’t make life choices.  Sheniqua in Section 8 housing was always meant to be Sheniqua.  She couldn’t better herself if she tried, and she shouldn’t bother.  Even Ming, the nail salon owner was meant to do what she does.  Non-whites are just scenery to them, like trees.  It’s the “bad white” who, through proper “education” and soul searching needs that needs to be rescued to become a “good white.”The bad whites react to this by doubling and tripling down on everything the “good whites” hate about their class.  The jack up their pick-ups even higher.  They buy more camo-cargo shorts.  They keep wearing their Trump hats.  They buy another gun.  They send another mass e-mail with gospel quote from white looking Jesus, etc.  They retreat into their own class as a protective measure.  They get angrier.The “good whites” have elevated themselves to this priestly, pharisaical class that seeks one of two things from “bad whites,” total eradication or total conversion.  They are a secular ISIS that emerged from Victorian era Methodism, casting off religion in the early 20th century, to become a secular cult that took off after the war.  A cult of “better living.”  And boy do they tell us how to live, with every waking moment.

            JR, as with Z-man’s commentary, there seems to be a contradiction here.  If the races hate the Whites so much, how can they make a distinction between the bad and good Whites?  Seems a poor way to conduct a class struggle taking on allies that will eventually turn on you (good Whites) when the bad whites are eliminated.

                It’s not supposed to make sense, these are people “good whites” who don’t live in reality.  They wouldn’t know reality from a hole in the ground.  Also, other races are expected to hate all white people until bad whites are eliminated.  Bad whites tarnish all whites in their minds.  Why wouldn’t they when they see Cletus in cargo shorts with dip in his mouth?

                Whites get shit done. All the POCs in the world couldn’t take down whitey so they convinced whites to take a knee in the name of fairness and diversity and tolerance and progress.Anyone who has been anywhere that is truly diverse, which of course means absent white people entirely, has seen that people will find their own similarities and differences and group up accordingly.Soon enough those differences feed conflict and competition and those similarities feed in group preferences.They (who you ask?) leveraged our inclination to self-segregate along the most discernible lines in order to divide us.White hate and class warfare are not mutually exclusive. There is class warfare, but that is one of many tools employed to propagate white hate.Whiteness is still the problem. If it were just class warfare it would be okay to be white, just not a poor white or a religious white – or even the inverse. Being a poor white grants you no status among the poor pocs. Still white. Still the problem.Its not okay to be white because whiteness or even they very idea of a white identity is forbidden.In class warfare you can elevate out of a lower class. Nobody can elevate out of whiteness.Goodwhites can only grovel harder, clap longer for POCs, move to a better neighborhood and hope that they outlive the prog holiness spiral before they get consumed by the hate.The same hate that consumed the hillbillies that stupidly clung to their bibles and their guns instead of embracing Progress.Yes the goodwhites are priestly for now. But they will be burned at the stake as soon as they are deemed heretics or insufficiently enthusiastic about their replacement.Just look at how quickly the gentile goodwhite prog women have been jammed down the totem because of their whiteness. Its coming for all of them.And if it is all class warfare. Then bring it on. Burn them out of their gated lives and we can get on with the gulag.

                    “Yes the goodwhites are priestly for now.

They’re like they guy in Alaska (Into the Wild).  Had he known he would be eaten by bears he likely would have made other plans.  And just like the fool who in that movie, a lot of them come from upper class suburban backgrounds.  They don’t understand the gravity of the situation.  You do.  I do.  They don’t.

                    By the way.  This “Into the Wild” guy is a saint to these people.  He reached peak good-whiteness.  Before he was eaten of course.  Maybe as he was being eaten.  Some woman just died trying to reach his bus.  He may as when be the Francis of Assisi of the woke.

                    If a poc lives next door to a white liberal, then that poc is likely one of a few in the neighborhood.  If the numbers of poc in a neighborhood rise enough, white liberals leave if they can, just people of all races do.

        One fundamental problem is the insane idea that a ‘nation’ is defined by a piece of parchment, or a clever and eloquent act of war propaganda as the Declaration was. And not by an organic people. The ‘proposition nation’ is the definition of an ideological state and an ideological state is guaranteed to founder eventually, when reality refuses to pay homage to the official ideology.Underneath every single non-Western nation or civilization there is an ethnic understanding of national identity. The Chinese claim to be communist, they act like imperial mechantilists but everyone understands that being Chinese has everything to do w ethniticy. The same is true for the West. The West are the historic homelands, indigenous or settled, of whites. If that is not generally recognized in the next very few decades, the West will be gone.

            Moran, excellent insight.  The Chinese are the way they are today, because the CCP (after Mao) finally gave up and modified their ideology to match the people’s genetic proclivity…and here they are today.We got into our trade problems with them for the same reason we get into all our problems in dealings with other races, a failure to recognize those racial/cultural proclivities.  There are economists that have recognized such.  Thomas Sowell for example has several books outlining such and tracing immigration and success of immigrants (over native populations) in other countries, albeit he won’t term his observations in the terminology I and other in HBD fields use.

                    He also has a White wife.  None-the-less, his observations wrt racial/ethnic differences in success of people among any number of nations is spot on and supported by data.  His explanation of why this occurs is simply lacking, or rather falls short as he always jumps to the conclusion, “culture”.  HBD recognizes culture as well, but allows that culture is often downstream from biology.  One can read Sowell with that change of understanding and learn a lot.

                        Sowell is often spot on. Sometimes the “diverse” could do well — but they are not of my nation. I don’t want them around and they don’t care for me. Separation is what is needed. Then we can see some of them do well … or not. Either way, they need to go someplace else.

                        Yes, his second wife is White; the mother of his children is black.  In all seriousness, why do you write “culture is often downstream from biology” rather than accept that it is always biology/genetics which give rise to different cultures?  One doesn’t have to believe HBD is 100% totally determinative (I don’t) to recognize culture in general is always downstream from it.  As far as the utility of reading Sowell – I did – 10-15 years ago.  Until he decided to blame all Negro dysfunction on the Scots-Irish – at which point I moved on to better thinkers and writers.

                            One reads Sowell, as one reads many authors, whether in agreement with or not.  WRT Sowell, as a Black man he carries weight with the opposition.  He would be logically pointed to by Leftist progressives as the exception to much of what we generally discuss here.  We of course accept that there are exceptions, and expect to see such examples as Sowell.When I have such discussion, not very often these days as I don’t really have time for Leftist ideologues, he is a natural cite for such findings as he writes about and we discuss.  His insights wrt Leftist progressives in “Visions of the Anointed” is pretty good reading as well.A tool is a tool, I don’t really care where it comes from, as long as it works to solve the current problem I am working on.

And not by an organic people. The ‘proposition nation’ is the definition of an ideological state and an ideological state is guaranteed to founder eventually, when reality refuses to pay homage to the official ideology.”All human habitation is an attempt to build a safe harbor against the chaos and uncertainty of both the natural world and the equally unpredictable ups and downs of human nature. Who knows how many systems have been fashion in the past to try and accomplish that project? There’s simply no telling. But one thing they all had in common, is that they were all imperfect and ultimately failed.Moran ya Simba Said:  “The West are the historic homelands, indigenous or settled, of whites. If that is not generally recognized in the next very few decades, the West will be gone.”That’s true. But what do you mean by White? Ethnicity usually trump’s skin tone.  And America is still quite regional. I don’t think the cajuns would be comfortable living around a few hundred North Dakota white pride survivalists.   Personaly, I don’t think along the lines of the great White family. I think about what is important in my own White life that I what to exist after I’m dead. I think that’s a good place for everybody to start.

                I think that may be overcomplicating it a little. Functionally, a ‘white’ is someone who wants to marry whites and whom whites find it ‘natural’ to marry. Or something, I guess I take a Darwinian approach to it.

        I’ll agree that in the natural world, the parasite is not evil. It evolved to maintain itself by finding a host and flourishing within that host’s environment. The parasite has its place because it is a part of the natural world. But parasites frequently kill their hosts. Oh, they don’t mean to. It just happens as a natural result of how parasites evolve. I can accept this. But everyone will understand if from time to time a pesticide is employed to keep the parasites under control. It makes the host so much more comfortable.

                In the ocean there are certain types of sucker fish that I guess are technically parasites – but they serve a useful purpose as they usually get their nourishment by cleaning away dead skin, and other smaller parasites from the much larger fish that they are attached to.You can see the same type of relationship in action between some types of birds and large mammals like rhinos and elephants.  The large animals in fact will encourage the “parasites” as they eat the insects often cling to their skin.The black woman and her three kids that are attached to my back don’t do shit for me.  I can’t her to stop puking down the back of my pants – the bitch keeps getting fatter and fatter and harder to carry – and not a single one of her damn kids will even mow my lawn or wash my car.Bring on the pesticides.

        Great essay.  And yes, they DO really hate us.Last summer I took my children to Monticello, as our homeschool studies had just emphasized the genius of Jefferson.  Lo &amp; behold, we learned in our visit that Monticello was built entirely by the Hemings family, while the entire plantation of slaves were under the constant oppression of the doddering old white hatemonger in the mansion.  Apparently the old man came out every once and awhile, but only to diddle one of the slave gals.  I grasped the hate from the get-go, pulled my kids out of the guided tour, and proceeded to emphasize the accomplishments of Jefferson, which are readily apparent as you observe the design of the grounds and myriad inventions throughout the house.  Or, of course, just read our Declaration of Independence.They hate us, they hate our history, they hate our heritage, they hate our civilization.

                Well, if my recent visit to the National Parks of Utah, Idaho, and Montana are any example, we are already there.  No tour or stopping point or visitor center was free of lectures on anthropomorphic global warming, nor was it not obvious wrt movies and literature that “diversity” was in full swing.  Not that any minorities were apparent.  Everyone was pretty much White.  Poz’d to the max.

                        Well, there were some indications that they are experiencing and adjusting to the wonders of diversity.  At Arches National Park, the toilets come with directions for use.  Yes, icons that tell our Asian brethren not to stand on the toilet seat and shit into the hole, while pointing them next door to oriental slit trench toilets for their “convenience” .The wife knew nothing of these oriental toilets and this required lengthy explanation in their use and of their reputation for extreme filthiness.  At that point, I believe my wife had second thoughts on her incessant nagging to go on vacation to the Far East.  😉

            CAPT S:  That anti-White animus was already evident the last time I took my boys to DC and the Smithsonian in 2007.  Instead of the classic historical exhibitions from my youth, which were mostly still there for the older boy to enjoy in 96 and 99, everything old was gone – and replaced with exhibits about the Negro migration to the north with WWII, the terrible White oppression of the loyal Japanese during the war, and the heroism of women workers and soldiers.  I don’t believe it’s mere cohencidence that the Smithsonian – along with National Geographic – has new  (((female))) management.  Check out who’s in charge of the Monticello tour guides; you will very likely find the same.

            Join the discussion…You can’t visit a zoo, botanical garden, or aquarium anywhere in North America without being constantly ordered to adopt the ways of the anti-white overlords.  Everything but everything is your fault and you need to start making penance for it right now.I was in a museum dedicated to power/electricity in Taiwan a couple months ago.  As you enter the exhibits, the first room is dedicated to the humans who advanced our knowledge of electricity and harnessed its power.  What jumped out at me right away was that the entire room was about white males.  Outside the realm of Western leftism, they felt no need to include some token broad or POC, someone who did little more than fetch the coffee for the real brains behind the outfit, but who can be dressed for the part.  They didn’t even bother trying to include an Asian.  It was just Franklin, Watt, Tesla, Edison, etc.

        Hating Whitey is the common thread that runs through American politics and culture. It is the thread that binds the elites to thier foot “soldiers” in pantifa and the academics and activists they fund to develop rhetoric and throw urine at white Americans. One cannot pass the gates of the establishment without swearing to it. Its the new patriotism of the new, degenerate America. Hating whitey is a career path. Ambitious youngsters in china study math and engineering. In America ambitious youngsters can master the language of anti white hate and get a job with the establishment (Sarah Jeong and Shaun King). Hating Whitey provides the tools the cloudies need to overturn the mid 20th Century egalitarian consensus on immigration so cloudies can pay shit wages both inside the US and without. In other words there seems to be plenty of reasons to hate whitey other than hate. Yet i think ZMan must be right. The relentless drive to break up white neighborhoods and schools seems more about hate than any political or material profit. In fact it has galvanized what little Identity Politics exists among the white electorate, so it is counterproductive yet it continues anyway. The constant portrayal in the media of white women who prefer non-white partners doesnt have any obvious purpose other than to undermine white men in the eyes of white women. This is all easier to understand when speaking of the Masha Gessens, Bill Kristols or Maxine Waters of the world. They are bigots. But the goodwhites are harder to grok. These are the people whose ancestors fought for the North and believed that it was a holy crusade to smite evil southerners and free the slaves. They are still crusading, but now they have a nation full of allies with names like Jeong and Boot.

        Equality is what it’s all about.  The hostility against whites won’t end until black arrests and incarcerations are equal to whites.  The same goes for school achievement, income, hiring…anything measurable that shows disparities has to be corrected.  You might say to yourself that maybe racial groups are different in many ways, including intelligence, time preference, trust, etc, but you better erase those evil and pseudo-scientific thoughts, bigot, and get with the program.  As long as the acknowledgment that races may differ is not allowed, the campaign against whites goes on and on…

        Contra the anti-Semites, this is not part of some global plot.
True. But which explanation is more troubling?
– It’s a global plot.– It’s the natural behavior of a group that thinks of itself as a permanent diaspora/minority because that’s the life it’s known for the past few millennia.
If you regard yourself as an eternal outsider, then you will see every majority culture as a potential threat that needs to be dissolved. No conspiracy required.

        Z’s right in recognizing that GoodWhites have entirely Othered themselves from BadWhites in a way that Derb, Sailer et al can’t bring themselves to accept on a gut level.  I’ve never found “pathological altruism” fully satisfying an explanation, and Sailer’s wholly cynical social status/political glue excuse is even less on point.My tweak on “path-alt” is that Whites have a gene-level predisposal for transcendental causes, for something bigger than themselves to believe in.  What MacDonald calls “path alt” is the result of letting hostile non-Whites hijack this hardwiring.  Medieval Christianity, White Man’s Burden and Manifest Destiny imperfectly but effectively innoculated us against the pathological levels of out-group moral elevation and individualism that Enlightenment modernity and the Frankfurt School have now unleashed and catalyzed.  They gave us Whites-first, multi-generational causes to provide greater meaning and kept the in-group broad enough to resist the racial scale self-destructive factionalism and sectarianism we see today (the Reformation notwithstanding).Whites need a transcendental view of themselves as a race/people again to fill the foundational cracks that the Yarzonys, D’Souzas and Goldbergs of the Right and Lerners, Heers and Goldbergs of the Left are presently using to pump toxic waste into our most powerful and unique center of motivation and meaning.

            Cracking the barrier keeping whites from seeing themselves as a group with interests, seeing other groups as competing for their own interests, and accepting race realism, is the hardest part.  I notice there’s a tendency that for those who finally understand this view, a switch flips on, and suddenly see this fight we’re in passionately and perhaps in a transcendent way. We need to keep hammering away at that barrier.

            The word “transcendental” is the key to this.  The “good white” liberals still see themselves as having a higher purpose, only stripped of all Christian origin decades ago.  It became a humanist one.  Only a white person can be a real humanist to them because only the white person can act as a superman (ubermensch) as described by  Nietzsche.  So which is more racist?  A white person who thinks that non-whites are victims, incapable of intrinsic motivation,  to be saved and cared for by the liberal ubermensche or the white person who believes that the non-white may not have genes to live in an organized society but should be free to pursue their own ambitions to the best that they can?

        I’ve never understood the Right’s blindness on this point (well, the blindness of the “Right” that doesn’t get paid, anyway).  How can you yourself be White, and yet hate White people?  Well, you are also half your father, and yet “F*ck you, Dad!!” is the essence of Leftism.  In my darkest moments, I think “Didn’t believe they meant what they said” is a pretty good inscription for Western Civ’s tombstone.

        It is instructive to recall that, as far back as the early 20th century, the Jewish Communists in America had, as one of their interminable schemes, a plan to de-segregate and racially integrate the professional sports leagues and teams.Their motive was NOT racial justice for the negro.  Their reasoning was as follows:1.  Sports heroes are natural objects of public fascination; they are role models and idols for the nation’s youth; and women are naturally attracted to male athletic prowess.2.  If the negroes are permitted to enter the White sports leagues and compete evenly with White athletes, they will quickly come to dominate the sports leagues, due to having a natural athletic edge.3.  When this happens, White children will lose their natural White idols and role models and will be forced to look up to Black role models.  This will contribute to the degradation and demoralization of the White race.4.  Similarly, White women will be increasingly attracted to athletic Black men, which will lead to increased miscegenation and increased tolerance for race-mixing, which will further degrade and erode the White race.  Furthermore, the humiliation of being racially cuckolded by blacks will further demoralize White men.5.  And the degradation and eradication of Whites is a good thing, as the actual, hidden end-goal of Communism is not of course some daffy workers’ paradise, but rather the erasure of Whites and Christendom, and the permanent world-wide domination of the Jews.  This “communism” nonsense is just a means to an end.The rabid insanity of the Left looks like nothing so much as Red Guard style fanatics in China, the Khmer Rouge, Soviet Union — but especially the Maoists.  Communism is a kind of mass hysteria/mass hypnosis, but it’s end goal is never what the deluded true believers think it is.  Jews are never at a loss for proxies and golems to do the heavy lifting for them.  Anti-white mass hatred is just the use of the duskies, now that they’re so numerous, to achieve a hidden goal that is literally thousands of years old.

            Do you have a link to the plan to integrate professional sports or is this just your opinion? I’m not disputing it, it’s just that I’ve never heard of it. I always assumed it was Branch Rickey’s plan in order to get a competitive advantage by bringing in a really good player. (Jackie Robinson) That seems more in line with Occam’s Razor, but maybe I’m wrong.

        So who were the American ruling elite after the Second World War? Who were the Soviet ruling elite after the Second World War?
It might be disheartening, but every serious analysis leads to the exact same group. No one wants to say it, but everyone lives by their consent and woe betide all who cross them.

            Lot of native Russians, Georgians, Ukrainians, etc. in the Soviet Union ruling elite, Stalin was certainly a gentile, as was Beria, Malenkov, as was Molotov I think. Next, the American ruling elite was still pretty much WASPs and the occasionally upstart newcomer or middle American. Confirmation bias at work, because I’m pretty sure your facts are wrong here.

        The shrillness of the shrieking about whiteness is simply a reflection of their desperation. It is magnified now because they fear that their hold on political power may be at extreme risk. They have thrown the kitchen sink at Trump and he is still standing. They are parasites, and cannot exist without the teat of government to feed on. Trump threatens that. On the positive side, this behavior may well force the issue into the forefront and finally trigger a mass movement back to sanity.

                Return, that’s one interpretation.  The other is that the proposal was to stop illegal immigration, chain migration, and at least accept the best and brightest from *all* countries on a merit basis.  In politics, that’s called a deal.  That also is the basis for most countries’ current immigration law—for example New Zealand—and I’ve not heard of New Zealand getting very much darker because of such.

                    If the best and brightest are welcomed, we’ll see live-footage of those theoretical paper IQ tests per racial group getting a run-through.

                        Not really.  We use occupations/education as proxies for IQ.  Those in professions and skilled trades, and hired by US firms to undertake unfilled jobs in industry pass a pretty stiff admittance criteria.  What needs of course to be done is to *not* admit any applicants where there is no indication of occupational need.The H1b VISA fiascos in Silicon Valley and in corporate slimes like Disney are unacceptable.  And I’m not going to argue that such corruption is not endemic or will go away on its own, but it will be better than millions of subsistence farmers from Peru, Guatemala, or Ecuador crossing our borders.Remember, a major sticking point was that such application would be open to White countries without restriction.  Hence Pelosi/Dem’s calling this a ploy to “whiten” America.  Of course it would whiten America, White countries have the language skills and inbred talent.

        The Left does not hate whites because they are white – they hate whites because they are, more than any other race, Christians.  This is a spiritual battle between the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of this World.  The Bible tells us that the Kingdom of this World will become ascendent before the end.  Whether this is what we are seeing now, I do not know (nor do you, or does any man). As a white Christian, I am not surprised nor bothered by what is happening.  If you are, you are blind.  Satan and his followers are going to be given their time in the sun, then they will all be destroyed.

            The children of the Lucifer believe they will win, because this is their realm.  Why do you think the Anointed One they bring is your messiah?He is not.  The Increate is a distant influence, not an all-powerful magician.  He (it) can only strive for ephemeral, glacial change with the materials at hand.  Life is fragile.The Lucifer’s children have been promised this world; the eternal Covenant is an unbreakable promise, not something that can rescinded as the Christians preach.This is where their line is promised resurrection and rule.  They see it now.Why?  Because what possesses them can only exist here, in this environment, on this planetary surface.The return to the al-aliyah, the Allah, the El, the UnNameable, can only happen with the blood sacrifice of the cattle.  With you.This is the vision, the Bloody Messiah they bring.  The Deceiver.What you hear, what you strive for, exists outside of this atmosphere.  It has no hands.You are the Hand of the Increate- and soon, that Hand must fight, or die.Your God does not save you.You were made to save Him.Without you, without the Hands, the Light dies, dooming this world to ages of pain, to mindless hunger, an eon of Darkness.

        Slavery may be the original sin – but rejecting communism / socialism / all-powerful government administered by the elite is Whitey’s current sin.  Whites aren’t interested and don’t need that level of state supervision – hence the hate.  Their beloved brown people are glad to accept big government and happy to blindly follow the elite.
The elites in South and Central America are in no danger of being voted out of power, which makes our elites jealous.

            Best comment yet!  Let’s not forget the folks who were really BIG into the earliest days of the Transatlantic slave trade and who were prominent members of the elite in cities like NYC, Newport RI, and in the South,  Charleston SC and New Orleans LA.  Chattanooga’s Ochs and Sulzberger families — NY Times; the Lehman Bros. were from Montgomery AL.  Judah P. Benjamin, referred to in another comment here, was born on a Caribbean island but came to NOLA as a child.  He attended Yale University (founded by a man, a Brit., who owned slaves!!)  Benjamin became the Confederacy’s Secretary of State, no less.  No one ever hurt a hair on their head in the South!  Check out all the southern department store names — although department stores are now a definitely dying fixture in our cities.  People still talk about Goldstein’s in my small city.  The oldest synagogue in the US is in Newport; the 2nd oldest is in Charleston.  Beautiful structures, both of them.  Not in some grubby ghetto at all.Do some research, amazing what you’ll turn up.  I myself am descended from what I used to think were a bunch of simple farmers, some of them Quakers, who left the Massachusetts Bay Colony (kicked out?) and then settled in various RI towns in the early 1600s.  Have just recently learned that the crops they grew and the beasts they raised were carried to the Caribbean islands of Cuba and Barbados to feed the slaves working in the sugar cane fields.  $ugar growing was $o important that there was simply no land available there to raise food crops!  Another crop raised in New England was flax.  So what?, you say.  Well, flax is woven into linen and this was used for slave clothing, simple rough shirts, pants.  Voila’ — the beginning of the New England textile mills powered by the abundant waterfalls and streams found locally!The sugar crop was of course, returned to Rhode Island in barrels as molasses used of course, to make rum which then was sent to Africa to trade for slaves then sent to the sugar plantations, then rice fields in SC and later cotton fields in Alabama and Mississippi.  Fascinating to read up on these Yankees, like the DeWolfes of Bristol and the Browns of Providence, as well as the Sephardic ((families)) in Newport.  Oh, guess who owned a large number of Rhode Island distilleries?History is such fascinating stuff.  We should just let it be — not twist it to suit present-day speech codes.

                Fabulous, Dre, excellent detail.The white slaves that built the colonies have been forgotten, with culture war propaganda (“British atrocities!”) replacing their history.
I contend that the Revolution occurred because the good Christian King George had declared war on the slave trade, so the slave traders declared war on the King.

            Americans didn’t give Smallpox to the Indians. Nor did we wipe them out. Nor did we steal the land. So, why do Americans believe this?

        And just as an aside, in that article Z linked to, why is the “American Conservative” publishing an article trying to stir up white guilt about the Philippine frickin Insurrection, of all things! Whether or not annexing the Philippines was a good idea, the war ended in 1903, which was 116 years ago, and the Philippines hasn’t been a US possession since 1935. Anyone who had anything to do with it is dead. Hell, their kids are dead, and their grandkids are getting up there. What exactly is the purpose of this besides “White man bad, US Imperialism bad”?  If you want to criticize US interventionism, there are plenty of other more recent conflicts that are more germane – like, say, the war going on in Afghanistan right now? I know that Bacevitch hasn’t been the same since his son got killed in action, but come on. Isn’t “McKinley Lied, People Died” taking this a bit far?

            These are all excuses, not actual causes, of antiwhite hatred. In the US it’s slavery, and occasionally the Indians, and now the Philippines. In Germany it’s you-know-who, in Britain it’s imperialism. But then there’s Sweden, Norway, Denmark and all the other Western European places. There it’s just ‘racism is baaad!’ I mean, Sweden, no black man has set foot there before the friggin airplane was invented to fly him there. It’s not a place Mabubu and his family would just randomly stroll into.Slavery is not the cause of any of this. Slavery in the US is just a weaponized narrative today. If they didn’t have slavery, they’d find something else. Just look at Canada.

                Very much agree. Rule number one – the white man is always wrong, especially if he’s American.With regard to the Philippines, as with Iraq, the US couldn’t win. If we had let the Spanish keep them and continue to repress the Pinoys, we would have been guilty of “turning our backs on the victims of Imperialism”. Had we freed them and then left them to be snapped up by the Germans or the Japs (which is almost certainly what would have happened) we would have been guilty of “throwing them to the wolves”. And had we freed them and set up a friendly government, we would have been accused of “propping up a corrupt puppet dictatorship”. Every single accusation I’ve put in quotes has been applied by the Left to something that the US has done internationally. As noted above, I have no idea what the proper course of action with regard to the Philippines was, but rest assured – no matter what we did, the Left would be criticizing it, just as they criticized the US for supporting Saddam Hussein, ignoring him, and removing him.

            OBT, as with much of the writings of that time, the meaning of words and sentences changes wrt modern definition/interpretation.  Most folk today are so uneducated, and now intellectually lacking, that they can not understand/interpret the meaning of the phrase, “…all men are created equal…” *as it was meant* by Jefferson (and by extension, the Founders) at that time.It is nonsensical to assume the Founders meant that all men are equal in ability and character.  Every examination of other writings of the time indicate the opposite.  After all, the Founders were self made men and represented what they termed at the time a “Natural” aristocracy!  It was this Natural aristocracy as opposed to the old world concept of nobility—authority/leadership that was passed on from father to son, regardless of merit—who were considered the appropriate leaders of this new society.Equality, meant equality before the law, and therefore at the very least equal opportunity to join the ranks of the new aristocracy via dint of hard work and character.  That this concept/result of individual effort leading to success may have been lost over the centuries, or fails to pan out for most people, does not negate the Founders’ original thinking.  And dovetails well with current understanding of HBD science.

There’s that attitude again. Look, I really don’t give half a s**t what old Tommy Boy meant or didn’t mean. What I care about in how it’s been interpreted by successive generations. Those later interpretations have been codified into law which makes the Jeff mans meaning irrelevant. So lets cut the Linguistics crapola and try and see where the hell we’re at. The Constitution is a legal document yes? And those 9 pricks on the Supreme court have been “interpreting the constitution” and giving forth royal decrees from day one. Are ya with me sofar? even that jackass Jefferson understood (too late) what a mistake it had been to give the supreme court so much freaking power.Read this.http://www.clayjenkinson.com/thomas-jefferson-and-the-supreme-court/And this.https://www.quora.com/What-did-Thomas-Jefferson-think-about-the-Supreme-CourtWords are power, and lawyers are wizards.

                    No one argues that the interpretation is today understood as you explained.  The explanation I provided is at best an apology for the Founders who are often criticized here and elsewhere for their “wording” of that line in the Declaration.  Their wording was sound for the time in meaning and understanding.As you’ve noted it is the “cleaver” men of future generations who have perverted the phrase to fit their own goals.  If the Founders failed to anticipate anything, it was in the creation of a Supreme Court of who’s decisions there is no appeal—at least not specifically mentioned/outlined—and now via tradition/precedent law of the land.

                Lineman, I would not argue with you in that thought.  The world was very White in those days.  Italians for example might not be even considered. My thinking here, as has been pointed out, is more generous wrt such matters.

            I’ve always interpreted this statement to mean that none of us got to choose our parents, so it’s asinine to treat anyone unfairly based solely upon a circumstance that they had no control over. In life, you play the hand you are dealt (no whining allowed).

                Therein lies the problem. TJ probably meant it as everyone should be treated fairly, as in no barriers put in place by gov’t to life, liberty and pursuit of happinessby your own ability and efforts.  Today’s elites take it to mean equality of outcome, therefore some men need barriers put in front of them, others need a legal leg upregardless of your own ability and efforts.  TJ is long dead, so what he originally meant is irrelevant.  To be fair, even if he had not written those nefarious lines, the Left would have found another way.

                TomA, correct.  However, the modern interpretation we see is that unequal outcomes are correctable and unjust.  The culprit in this injustice is the winner of life’s lottery and therefore must be made to give back that which was unfairly obtained, albeit through no fault of his own.

        Is this our future though Z? It seems that the Anglophone World is legitimatly on a path to immolation and is dragging the rest of the West along to destruction. You’ve made a comment recently in your letters to Zman that a resegregation and a return to freedom of association is a potential step. I can’t see it. The USSR collapsed bloodlessly but the level of hatred towards the White population and the levels of self loathing among the proggessive hordes make this unlikely to me. I don’t want to be blackpilled and I wish to God or Gnon that there is hope but it looks like the end of all. You could mention the Black Plague or Reconquista but at that time there was no all pervasive doctrine of suicide. You say that there will be shoots of what comes next, but tell that to the modern Greeks or Romans. The pinnacle of human achievement but now irrelevent. We can build networks you say possibly, but what can we keep, and do you think the Progs can leave us alone. I’ve a family, I’m 40 and I live in Europe. I’m not especially Religious but even Christianity has turned against us. There doesn’t seem to be anything else except terminal decline.

        Somewhat disagree.White dispossession is not limited to the United States, but is happening GLOBALLY all over the Western world, often in countries with no serious history of colonialism or slavery.Bad ideas like the declaration of independence probably matter somewhat, but ANYTHING that is not explicitly pro-white will eventually become anti-white. It’s not productive to fixate on any single bad idea, it’s more a problem with our values as a whole and our blindness to certain forms of attack.In the old days when being pro-white was more stigmatized, people would hop from ideology to ideology looking for some way to be implicitly pro-white, without being explicitly white nationalist. I did this myself.But there simply wasn’t anything implicitly pro-white out there. Everything had been twisted and transformed into something anti-white. Even stuff that seems like it should be implicitly pro-white… just wasn’t.Labor unions inexplicably wanted to lower their own wages, environmentalists inexplicably wanted to destroy the environment, religions inexplicably wanted to dispossess their own flocks. Even something like European Paganism is NOT implicitly pro-white, like you might expect. The mainstream version is anti-white, the pro-white version was made by dissidents reacting to that mainstream.The explanation for this is simple. In unconventional warfare, all available pressures are used. Military is only a small part of it, political, economic and cultural pressure are also potential forms of attack.Whites were subjected to a cultural attack by an outside group. And the attack was very effective, because Whites were somewhat overspecialized.

        America afforded these Jewish sons of dirt farmers to rise to the aristocracy and join the Globohomo Tribe, every war champs. But they didn’t get the joke, so to speak. And the new foreign virtue signalers are not getting the Jewish rendition of the joke, such that you are now two levels deep on not getting the joke.The problem is simple. Final victory over the Smelly Badwhites means either a slow death of starvation or a fast death by decapitation. Therefore, no matter how many amusing contrivances you come up with to spite the peasants, it is important to never kill them off.

        “Jews, of course, were still excluded from the elite.”
Were they? One of the leaders of the Evil Confederacy was a Jew who runnned away to London when his side lost the war, there is some conspiracy theories that he was responsible for the murder of Abraham Lincoln.

            The wording of that is telling: “excluded from the elite,” eh?  So this is what their complaint was.  They were not excluded from entry into the wealthiest most powerful country in human history.  They were not excluded from citizenship and ordinary life and participation in this country.  No, this was not enough; they were (and remain) endlessly bitter and spiteful because of partial — only partial, mind you–  exclusion “from the elite”.  Nothing less would do, not normal life, not Liberty, not prosperity.  Gotta have those top, top spots.In America they couldn’t possibly get away with the old reliable grumbling about how “the Cossacks killed my grandpa” (which of course, by the way, also didn’t happen), so the new complaint was “Holdington Everworth III wouldn’t let my grandpa into Harvard”.  Then after they had fully infested Harvard,  it was, “the WASPs let my whole family into Harvard, but they wouldn’t let my nephew become President of Harvard”.  Now it is, “sure we own Harvard, and we are the presidents of all the universities, and own all the newspapers and media hubs, and control both political parties and all of Congress, but… what about our black and Latino pets?  There’s still some Whites in good jobs who could be booted out for them.”The talk of parasitism is surely too kind; I’m pretty sure we are discussing pancreatic cancer.

                This parasite analogy might be done, but I’ll add.  An *unsuccessful* parasite kills its host before it reproduces or finds another host.  In modern description, those folk currently jockeying for promotion to positions of elevation within the society (these days known as inclusion) without dint of merit are “feeding” off the host.  Those taking up such positions at the expense of others of merit are “killing” the host.  South Africa is a good example of the parasites killing their host and are an example in end stage.  We are in an early stage of such folly.

        The truth of the matter, as some have alluded to already, is the Declaration of Independence was a declaration of war on 1776. Also, the document can be understood as having the rhetoric of the time which includes the majority of the “enlightenment” writers.However, there is one event that everybody either ignores or doesn’t know that explains both it and the current divide: the English Civil War. The concept that all “English” men are created equal along with other ideas such as the right to silence and freedom of religion came out of that conflict or the people of that conflict. Cutting off a kings head and setting up a republic/commonwealth in 1649 heavily influenced all founders. Hell 1649 to 1776 is less time than the end of the American civil war to now, 1865 to 2019.

        I agree mostly. Intellectuals though merely justify after the fact not cause social revolutions. Kings and Princes had been feuding with the Church since Charlemagne’s time over the formers appetite for Church land and wealth. It was gunpowder and the printing press that gave the decisive advantage to Kings over the Church and Martin Luther was the mere instrument of justification not the cause.In our case the pill, condom, anonymous urban living and independent female wealth created anti White sentiment which is really at its core female disdain for the White beta male which is easily 90% of us.Multiply every White womans disgust at a nerd approaching her by social Media and you have anti White stuff. Add in elites overproduction and longing for non White aristocracy … Avatar and Dances With Wolves bang the hot alien princess and be a King not an ordinary man and that’s all it takes.

            The white beta male, this is an interesting thought. I grew up being trained by culture to be a beta. About 30 years ago Ayn Rand’s various characters  taught me partially that there was even a different choice. It was glorious.I did become a huge asshole, and caused myself a lot of problems, but it led to being open to the concept I’ll call self-ownership for this post.Then about 2005 I found a “dating guru” for gods sake whose nom de plume is David DeAngelo. (Cute!) This guy nailed the Women Hate Pansies thing so perfectly, I was floored. I upgraded my behavior with my wife and never told her. Just watched her get happier.Just started a new book on charisma, still more to learn. I have fun watching people take on submissive behaviors around me, though I’m not really trying to push people around. Quite the opposite. Other alphas make me submissive, still. It’s on ongoing project.

        I’m waiting to for an America hating white person to tell me how bad it is to live here. I will ask a simple question: If you could move which country would you choose?  My guess they will say Canada, the Nordics, etc. In other words White Western Civilization. At which point I will note they choose a white country because they are racist.

        Apparently posters have been scattered across NYC calling for Trump supporters to be put into death camps.  This is what they say about us with no adverse consequences in our white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchy, while we have rifles and a majority of the population.  I can hardly wait to see what they will do to us in their progressive, socialist matriarchy run by POC and Muslims.

        Colonialism, the Holocaust, and slavery are all just convenient narratives because our enemies will never let a crisis go to waste.  Karl Marx thought communism would take root in White, Christian, industrialized countries.  The only one that seriously tried it was Russia.  Invaded by the Nazis, they did not fight on behalf of the global proletariat, they fought for Mother Russia.  Communism only survived and had success because it went nationalist, betraying its origins.  Communists hate that.  They also hate that their strongest opposition came from Christians and nationalists.  Whites heavily believed in these things.  Therefore white people have to be eliminated because we have failed communism.Also, remember, Karl Marx was the 19th century equivalent of a progressive millennial.  he never held a job, came from money, was terrible at handling it and had to be bailed out.  He was a mediocre person in the real world and created a philosophy to justify that mediocrity.  Those who follow in his footsteps are the mediocre.

        Having conversations with good whites, one will immediately be struck by how uninformed they are on key issues.  Often times, they can be pleasant and charming.  Just hopelessly uninformed, and their “good white” views can be thought of as a post-Christian religious belief.  (Except for feminists who are never pleasant and charming.)By the way, Max Boot is a raving lunatic. It’s amazing that he was taken seriously at one point.  Boot and Kristol and Goldberg and the heinous Jennifer Rubin are proof that there is NOT a Jewish cabal ruling society.  If so, they’d all have been muzzled long ago.  They’ve done a lot of damage to their tribe’s ability to influence policy.

        “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ”What is missing here Is the word “in”. It should be inserted between the words equal and that. That would/should eliminate the confusion most of the idiots out there are suffering from.Then again they refuse to acknowledge the truth in the statement “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” Only bad whites get this. Personally, being one of the Bad Whites is what keeps me going. I fly my Confederate Battle and Betsy Ross flags proudly. Color me American Anglo Saxon.Reasonable Mans Rules are primarily for the Bad Whites. Rules like treating everyone with respect until they give them a reason not to. Good whites cannot understand these things. Their inferior intellect or lack of intellect prohibits them from doing do.Treating everyone equally is a far cry from everyone is equal. Good Whites know this but refuse to admit it as truth. I am sick to death of them.

        Toleranced is weakness and Weakness breeds OpportunismWen the US Right traded out religious ideology for money cucking , it became Leftist and nothing is worse than Blue on BlueAn actual Right would be willing to enforce a fixed  probably religion driven  procivic moral standard  at gunpoint .And if it eschews homosexuality , porn , abortion , drugs or easy divorce it has to punish people and punish at least socially advocates for itA really Rightwing society regulates trade and commerce for the public good since a healthy people withs steady work is the foundation of a moral society.Otherwise easy living and yes Capitalism eating its own seed corn as always basically  all of modernity pushes society Leftward.The problem with dealing with the issue politically  is the  Libertarian element , the Rand Paul’s of the world are unwitting Leftist moles.I mean  in America in 1950 while you could mail  order guns since they were a civic good, porn was a crime, drugs a crime, blue laws common , abortion and often birth control illegal   homosexuality was a crime, adultery was a crime, divorce was hard and sometimes even the written word was censoredTaxes on the rich were high, imports controlled and where needed, regulation was used,That is not a Libertarian nation nor by modern standards all that free.It was however Conservative one and a future Conservative one will have to have and use authority otherwise it’s still a Leftist  one   . You can’t entirely  get rid of Cultural Marxism , the Rot  or mass immigration without force.The only Conservative faction that understood this the anti abortion crowd, they have over time against  considerable resistance managed to make the US abortion much lower in areas where they have enough members and have eliminated a lot of abortion clinicsI don’t agree with what they want but at least on that issue, they are a genuinely Conservative movement since they see abortion as dyscivic.If that leave me alone crap can’t be kettled and people won’t give orders than there really is little to gain. The problems can’t be solved by hoping for a revivalThey have to be enforced by an elite that actually believes  what they are preaching

The problem is, nobody is willing to admit, “well, that wasn’t such a good idea”, and scrap the program.
They refuse to even see the damage.Then the damage becomes a federal program, not limited to a city or state.That’s the biggest damage of all.

                Governments by definition are authoritarian institutions that exist to enforce moral order, FFS.  There is no historical example of a successful society without authoritarian enforcement of moral order.  To adults, how you accomplish this is the important question, not whether “non-moral non-authoritarian government” is possible (which it isn’t).

Since “open borders” is a federal issue, you prove my point.  Big isn’t always beautiful.
Conservatives were as happy to trample the states’ citizenry as leftists in their lust for power- turning us against each other for their own gain, rather than against foreign influence.

They are just looter cucks and Leftists 20 years behind the restEveryone knows this.This is about getting power to enforce what in the past would have been known as Conservative social norms.That is the the job of the Dissident Right , if they want power anyway. They have to  make a new one using the good parts of the old one and whatever tools they have and know to useIt’s not hard, know who your people you are and what the current culture is like, set rules, be as fair and righteous  as you can and enforce those rules.

                If it were my moral order damn right I’d be happy.  Hell when i was a boy something close to  my moral order was enforced and it was a decent countryOn the whole till they went cuckoo around 25 years ago  the current people in charge did a pretty good job at making sure the basics were taken care ofThis means  if someone  else wants to become “the New Elite” they had better learn to do the basics even better.That’s what a rotation of the elite is, someone else takes charge and does better or if weak or useless, gets eliminated.The people that basically just want to “ban abortion cause feelz and go home to the redoubt” are unfit to lead anythingThis is an 80% urban, only semi religious, high tech society in a very complex interconnected world with numerous pathways that social and technological destruction.if someone wants to take charge than by God they had better be ready to do the job. The Dissident Right has within it too many elements that are unwilling to do the hard work and think that America 2019 is fit for a Liberty or Libertarian social orderWe are absolutely not.You know that trop the Left brings out about modern immigrants being just like old immigrants? If you ignore the differences in race and habit, it’s pretty close to true .We are not  made up of the stalwart Christian  freedom loving Angos that founded the nation and John Jay so admired .. Instead all those people that came here whatever race  are the shoe scrapings and failures of their society leavened with a handful of very smart people. The US being basically a nation of religious nutters ,  grifters , thieves and  economic refugees from everywhereThese are not people suited to Liberty in Modernity  and even if you expel the worst of them, if you don’t have enough State, well your milk will be malamaine, your beef fell cows , your chicken salmonella , well more than usual and so on. Some people can be trusted but most cannot when money is on the line and once you have a populace that is culturally corrupt you have a few choicesDo nothing and reap the whirlwind in sickness and social decayDon’t do enough and the same but less decayDo too much and cripple the economyor get it right and you get the post war eraSince we don’t have the luxury of that eras social capital , this means more bootmake people do the right thing till its second nature which should conveniently overlap with a 20-40 year interregnumIf you do it right, , you have to do less. If not? Moar BOOT!

        If the left is basing their moral empire on the wording of the Declaration – instead of their constant mis-interpretation of the Constitution – I’m somewhat encouragedBecause the Declaration pretty much allows us to separate, and resist, and says that all men are CREATED equal – but not that they remain that way.  It also says you may PURSUE happiness – it doesn’t guarantee you’re going to get it – and it doesn’t say anything about your happiness coming at my expense.If that’s the founding document they want to rest their future on – I’m not sure it’s going to work out so well for them.

            Your logic is irrelevant in this case – they change on a dime according to what works at the time, they’re untroubled by rationality or hypocrisy, and both the Constitution and Declaration are dead letters . . . except to TruCons and civnats  . . . who are determined to nobly lose come what may.

        CAPT S:  Same experience 2 years ago at the Liberty Bell Museum in Philly.  I hadn’t been there since oh 1968 and was astonished to discover that the Liberty Bell had nothing to do with the Revolutionary War but everything to do with slavery.  Of course all the corollary displays shoe-horned into the Mies van der Rohe glass cube were about ebeel massa, dem one’s who gave us glass n sheeit.Of course, walking outside the museum and over to City Hall, mid-afternoon on a weekday, was like a scene from Apocalypse Now.  My SJW daughter was introduced to not a few red pills that day.Oh, btw, ‘Cambria Will Not Yield’ is still available: by far the most based man on the internet, a real devotee of Carlyle, and a fantastic writer who sees only one hope–renascent Christendom:http://cambriawillnotyield.com/

        Do you really believe the US civil war was fought to end slavery? There is plenty of evidence to the contrary. There is a chasm of knowledge about American history between those who learned from school and the Hollywood screen and those who have explored beyond those myths. That is the real problem. How do you reach people whose entire historical construct is based on layers of lies? Where do you begin?

            It IS effectively too late to right the whole ship. At this point we aren’t even rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, we are left with simply debating the best way to rearrange those deck chairs. POC smell blood and aren’t backing off or going away, and white liberals have created a quasi religion out of multiculturalism. So called conservatives are far too comfortable to do anything. The time for collective action was 50 years ago, and the response of most whites was to pack up and run away to the suburbs en masse, hence white flight.Civilizations rise and fall. No historical examples of whole societies doing a collective 180 and turning everything around.I don’t think Europeans are going to go extinct, but the European experiment in North America is winding down because not enough people car enough to stop it. For everything wrong with liberals, at least they are motivated to organize. White conservatives talk,talk,talk… and then talk some more. Oh, and white conservatives are also keeping their powder dry, or whatever cute snark the preppers use these days. I’ve been reading preppers and patriots talking about waiting for that one special call to arms for more than 30 years… waiting for the call that never comes. Better to hole up in your shed and stockpile ammo and cans of Campbells soup than get out and organize. That might actually take some real work. Millions of white people with guns who are more interested in fantasizing about CWII than creating political action groups and networking in the real world.The Left won 50 years ago. Most whites simply gave up. it was easier that way. Easier to fade away and reminisce about the past than do the boring grunt work necessary to take back control of the ship.

                Most “conservatives” I know – won’t even expend the effort to unfuck their own heads of left wing ideas.
If you won’t even do that – expecting something that actually requires physical movement is probably asking too much

            Get armed now, fam.  Orange Judas Goat is the perfect delivery mechanism for “responsible gun control” as he makes a certain percentage of the White population comfortable enough to swallow measures they wouldn’t tolerate from Kabbala Haaretz et al.  Don’t let your shitlib relatives know you have guns and start documenting their own nuttiness as future ammo for opposing their “red flag” harassment actions against you. Screencap their triumphalist Faceberg screeds about getting their hillbilly relatives’ guns taken away before the WaPo tells them to scrub that shit.

                And join your local gun club. You’ll get practice using your guns and meet and interact with other gun owners, the great majority of whom are already hostile to the left.  If shit starts to get real, this is a logical place to organize the like-minded into effective resistance.

        The 1860 census revealed there were more negro slaves in the north than the south.
Always, slavery is reduced to talk about negroes despite the root of the word slaves, slavs.
There is interesting evidence that there were more white than black slaves in America  – indentured servants (they had false teeth?) – and were one to look up “Barbadosed” and “Kid nabbing” one would have the scales fall from their eyes but then the whole narrative about the holy negro might fall apart
