        In my eyes Don will fail if there is not serious retribution starting day one for all the damage the DC scumbags have done to America and the World. No less than mass firings and a lot of criminal charges is acceptable.

            I’d like to see him revoke all of Biden’s executive orders.
He should also cancel all the security clearances of all the Marxists in the shadows that use their access to secret information for Marxist power gains.

                    One really needs to understand the limits of Executive Authority.  Trump has no unilateral authority to eliminate government agencies—or any department created by the Legislature, nor to deny funding.
He’ll need Congressional support and since he has perhaps only a smallish majority, it’s possible he’ll not get approval from weakly seated congressmen.  A better ploy might be to get more authority wrt distribution of funds, or line item veto.

                            Yes, exactly. Dems know that by the time any serious or reasonable challenge comes to their behavior, the cat is out of the bag. The entire history of DACA from the Dream Act to Trump being unable to shut it down through the courts is very instructive on this.The post you are responding to makes sense if we lived in a country of laws, but we don’t anymore and have not for a very long time. Only one side seems to get this. Claiming you can’t do something because some act written in 1937 or whatever says you cannot is pure Washington Generals behavior.

                                The problem with using the democrats’ approach is that the democrats have wisely marched through all the institutions. They could get away with it because in large part, they already owned the agencies/institutions and had their guys in key positions for a long time, and filled the lower ranks over the years with patronage stooges. Trump doesn’t have that and it would take years if not decades to work through it.
Having said that, we have to start somewhere.

                                DACA elimination was stayed by the Courts—not simply ignored by the Executive Branch.  That the decision was in our mind wrongly decided not to the contrary.

                            Yes, really..  Can you cite an elimination of a dept such as Education by Dem’s.  Well you can’t.  The Executive Authority you cite is over the Executive Branch and those other areas, like student loan abatement, have been challenged and deemed unconstitutional.  At that point the Courts have little enforcement authority.

                                I would threaten to put all the D.C. marxists, feminists and fellow-thugs in prison on Day One, and then perhaps negotiate backwards from there.  Free the J6 prisoners on Day One, then announce to my Beltway enemies there was plenty of cell space now available.Not worry about where my ‘authority’ came from to do this ‘n that.  My enemies made politics, law and administration a zero-sum game of crushing me and mine, then expect me to observe the Marquis of Queensbury rules?Nupe.  I’m an Old Testament practitioner, law of talion.  It predates the Constitution, the code sections, and case law by a fair bit.

                        If it was up to me I’d see about getting Dick Cheney extradited to The Hague for war crimes. But they might have more creative and sneaky ways of screwing over the Cheneys. Their kind must not be allowed to rise again.

                            I’d love to extradite Cheney to Iraq, Syria or maybe Tajikistan. I don’t think he did anything bad to the latter in particular but they seem like the rapey and electrodey types.

                        We may agree on more than you think, LITS.  Yes I am a Christian but not much like most of those who currently infest my faith.And there is no question that Donald goes to pieces when it comes to Ivanka.  Last time around, he gave her a WH office and she promptly took the place over, intimidating people with the ‘my dad says’ threat.  Everybody promptly caved.  Then Donald made her doofus husband the Czar of the Middle East.  God help us.I cannot respect a man who allows his girl children to rule over him.  The U.S. teems with such men, and the results of their cowardice are plainly seen in our corrupt feminist institutions and nation.

                            It’s a commonplace of fatherhood. Even the toughest of men are puddy in the hands of their precious daughters. I’ve seen it over and over. On the other hand, fathers don’t–or didn’t–have the slightest compunction about whipping the hell out of their sons. I know this from personal experience.

                It is the eternal failure of the ‘conservative’ to clean up after evil progressives but not punish them. There is no deterrent to endless reiteration of bad behaviors. Jack Dodsen said it best upthread “Arrests and executions or it didn’t happen.”I’m ok either way. If the civnats who have just won don’t establish deterrence with executions, then JudeoPuritan proggy will just try again, delegitimizing civic nationalism and cementing the perception of the need for a more profound change.It’s all on the civnats now. This is their hour. I won’t stand in their way, but I won’t help them either, beyond my one little vote to help give them their last chance. My efforts will remain focused on what comes after civic nationalism is buried, because as sure as rain, they are going to blow it because fake and gay civnat is not a viable foundation for a functional society.

                    The Right does not have the groceries to do what it takes to restore America.  Many lead (very) comfortable lives and don’t want the tree shaken too vigorously, lest there be some discomfort and want in their existences.The OP sees Donald Trump as the ‘great man of his age’ but I disagree, based upon his past actions and his utterances.  I think he and his family — a overly strong influence upon him — have not passed through the trials necessary to shape a ‘great man of his age’.  Instead, he has led a very sheltered and privileged life.I’d love to be wrong and see Donald finally kick azz and take names.  And I’d love to see U.S. men regain their gonads and throw off their oppressors, for oppressors they indeed have.  Ain’t counting on it though.

                        I think Trump has risked his very comfortable life and shown more courageous leadership than I would have believed possible. The big turning point for him was when he was shot, the many lawfare attacks against him could have easily ended with him in jail.

                One thing Trump has shown he is good at is winning elections:  Three for three.  I would have thought, being a business man, he would know how to be an effective executive, but that was forlorn hope.
RFK and Vance were assets on the stump, but can either help execute the laws and run the country?  That is to be seen.
Elon seems a shrewd operator, but I fear he will withdraw from the arena to attend his hobbies.
Enjoy this unexpected victory.  We will know better how things will go by the end of January.

He does, but that’s business, not politics.  He owns his business, so it’s “my way or the highway”.  Politics deals with Congress Critters with their own power base.  So perhaps we need to rethink just how good he is wrt “the art of the deal”.  And in any event, do you want him dealing with Democrats?

                I think this is all for show. Trump is good at understanding star power. If Elon is put in charge of cutting government I’m almost completely certain he will be a figurehead. The plans have already been drawn up like they already had a pre-written Obamacare all ready to roll. They just need a figurehead outside of politics so that people can’t cry that it was political.

The Hoover Commission (1947–1949 and 1953–1955): Formed under President Harry Truman and continued by President Dwight Eisenhower, the Hoover Commission aimed to improve government efficiency after World War II. It was chaired by former President Herbert Hoover and made many recommendations on how to streamline and reduce redundancy in federal agencies.2.	The Grace Commission (1982–1984): Under President Ronald Reagan, the Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, commonly known as the Grace Commission, was formed to identify inefficiencies and recommend ways to reduce federal spending. The commission reported over 2,000 recommendations to save hundreds of billions of dollars, although not all of them were implemented.3.	The National Partnership for Reinventing Government (1993): President Bill Clinton’s administration established this initiative, often referred to as the “Reinventing Government” effort, led by Vice President Al Gore. It aimed to make government “work better and cost less” through reengineering processes, embracing technology, and reducing bureaucratic red tape.4.	The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB): Although not temporary committees, these agencies regularly review federal programs and make recommendations to improve efficiency and cut waste. The GAO, in particular, releases annual reports on “High-Risk” federal programs that are prone to waste, fraud, and mismanagement.5.	The Simpson-Bowles Commission (2010): Formally called the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, this bipartisan commission was formed under President Barack Obama to recommend solutions for reducing the national debt. Although not specifically focused on eliminating agencies, it proposed many budget cuts and reforms that would impact the size and scope of government operations.These committees often provide comprehensive recommendations, but their impact depends on political support and congressional action. While some ideas have been implemented over the years, others face challenges from competing interests, political disagreements, or a lack of follow-through.”We’ve been there, done that.  Old quote from one of my early university presidents, “Whenever I have an annoying issue to settle, I create a committee and assign the issue to them for their study and recommendations.  After which I never hear of it again.”  😉

            This is why I don’t have the same jubilation as others.  While Z isn’t wrong, a Trump win has done exactly what I thought it would do.  Conservatards think we are now back in 1985, and the left will embrace them with open arms.  This is why the right loses and the left knows how to win.  The left gets power and uses it to crush their enemies.  The right gets power and embraces its enemies.  Doing nothing less than crushing the DC scum, dissolving the alphabet groups and arresting the scum for treason is a colossal fail.

                “Conservatards think we are now back in 1985″
Who? I’m pretty sure Rush would never had said such a thing. I thought it was worth listening to Christ Plante this morning to see what DC conservatives are thinking, being as he is one, and didn’t hear anything like that. No, I can’t bring myself to listen to Sexton or Hannity or Levin. Someone else will have to do that. I’ve done my 2 hours of community service.
Are you sure that’s not just your blackpill speaking?

They haven’t learned a thing.

                                        Why all the black-pilling? An overwhelming majority of White men just voted for Trump. A clear majority of White women also voted for Trump, not only in 2024, but also in 2020 and 2016. Call me crazy, but I don’t see what’s to be gained by drumming up hostility between the sexes when White men and women are so obviously on the same side.Sure, the cucks and harpies get a lot of attention, but just now, White men and White woman united to give a giant middle finger to the Libs in spite of massive news coverage informing them that they were supporting the umpteenth reincarnation of Hitler. Let’s take at least one day to enjoy it.

As for your charge of ‘drumming up hostility between the sexes’, you act like all your institutions were not conquered by feminism long ago.  We should all just ‘get along’ with that tyrannical status quo?
Look, women rule over you. The government, courts, media, corporations, schools and colleges, heck even the churches have been neutered.  That is not negativity, it is the plain (if often unwanted) truth.  Don’t run from it.  Resist it and overthrow it.

                I won’t lie. I am jubilant. But I get your point. We let our guard down because politics isn’t our 24/7 obsession. The Enemy gets back to work while we celebrate. They will do all in their power to make the next four years miserable. And their power is awesome.

            A reckoning is coming.  I think it will by 99% declassification, firings, loss of clearances, and about 1% hard core prosecutions (Jack Smith/Lawfare and the NewYork State corrupt trials).  I think they’re going to find out it was a really bad idea to target a billionaire.

            They kept calling him “Schickelgruber” so perhaps he should prove them right with a “night of the Shell gas station long steak knives” and, say, eliminate all enemies in one fell swoop. Ok, maybe not catch the head of the S.A. in bed with a man, noting that fellow ended his tenure on earth with the name “Schickelgruber” on his lips, so there’s that.
But otherwise, Fort Leavenworth prison, firing squads and Gitmo for the lot of them. Is Otto Skorzeny still available to consult with?

        For progressives, and certainly for female boomer progs, Trump is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the self-chosen instrument of their own destruction. They called to mind the person they despised more than any other, and providence ordained that he would be their nemesis. It’s indescribably satisfying to watch them scream and run.

        Looking at the Dem popular vote totals over the years is hilarious. Obama 08 – 70M, Obama 12 – 65M, Clinton – 66M, Biden – 81M, Harris – 66M. Which one of these doesn’t belong? This makes the 2020 election look even more ridiculous, yet I guarantee that nobody in the media will talk about how Biden’s hand-picked successor fell off FIFTEEN MILLION VOTES and fell back to the long-term average. Also to note is that Trump is at 71M which is extremely close to the ceiling he set in 2020. This election seems to be what 2020 would have been without fortification.

Elon Musk is the inflection point.
As seen on X “Who else but Musk realized you could just buy the Death Star (X) when it was 80% completed?”

                        I guess everyone downvoting the comment supports Elon’s beta testing FSD on our roads?  Perhaps you might not feel the same way if your kid gets killed by a beta test FSD.
FSD is the most bugman feature possible on a modern car, even if it worked.  Outside of rush hour commuting, driving is a joy.

                            I didn’t downvote, but neither do I think it’s a big deal. For as many EVs as there are out there, it’s not a very high death count. And, as you point out, driving is fun. If you engage it because you are drunk, OK, probably a good trade-off. If you engage it just because, I’m fine with your butt being dragged into court for a Wrongful Death suit or even a Manslaughter charge.

                            Because as I said before, there are another 6 companies doing the same testing, yet you only pick upon Musk. Ford has also had fatal accidents.  What about the states that license such endeavors?  They get a pass, or you simply ignore them?In 2023 there were 44K automobile deaths, of which 17 were attributed to autonomous vehicles of all kinds and levels.  The NTSA has the final say here, but yet does not consider such accident rates as worth prohibitions.  Why not?  Well, because in the scheme of things it isn’t.For example, 2023 stat’s are yet to be complied for tire failure, but has consistently averaged 400 deaths per year.

                            Well over 50% of the population… In fact at least 63% (think on it) and counting should not be permitted to have autonomous control over a vehicle at any time. They’re too dangerous on a good day operating at full mental potential. And you’re worried about self-driving cars?

                                I’ve used autonomous mode driving.  I described such experience in the past.  Believe me, regardless of incompetent drivers and their potential “improvement” with autonomous cars, once this technology is proven and mainstream, it will be *mandated*. When/if it becomes mandated, I almost guarantee you will hate your “improved” driving experience.  It (driving) will become slow, tedious and unenjoyable—which I assume is the point.
if it only saves one life…sigh.

            I feel like last night’s result and the lack of pushback this AM tends to confirm my occasional thoughts that the color revolution madness of 2019-2024 was the Marxists’ last, best shot at finishing off America and turning it into a complete banana republic.I mean, look around this morning. The MSM are grumbling but mostly falling in line. There were a few Antifa true believers on the streets of  Seattle that were quickly rolled up. BLM is totally AWOL.Most importantly, there isn’t much noise about legal pushback coming out of official DC. I don’t think there will be, largely because the Marxists have suffered huge reductions in energy and competence on their side of the aisle.

As to Israel, the Pentagon will let Trump know that we can’t get into a war with Iran because we’d lose what respect the world still has for our military power. There’s nothing he can do.
Israel’s attack on Iran using our best equipment utterly failed. We don’t have anything better to throw at Iran, so we won’t try. Welcome to the new world where Jews can’t use their US golem to get whatever they want.

                        They—nefarious They—seem to think that’s what’ll happen, but we should know better.The one demographic that isn’t light-switch ready to move as the regime dictates is white losers. Trump stands in for them (weakly). He doesn’t lead them. Nobody does, as we sometimes lament. If Trump summons them to White Masada, they won’t come. The 20th century obliterated the bloodlines of theobedientwhite underclass.(Black guys seem to have the right temperament to form a resistance, but they’re too eager to side with power, even when it hurts them. Stepin Fetchit, natural conservative. The armyremains, as white boys abandon it, disproportionately black.)It’s fine to doubt/reject current Trump for our own reasons. I think the arrival of Musk et al. in Team Trump represented his total defeat. The assassination was a success, etc. We know what kind of things I say. Maybe I’m wrong—mistaken—but I’m notamplifying regime media. I’m a loser.My symbolic defeat of the week was hearing Gregory Hood say that the Trump campaign was in a tailspin because of Hinchcliffe’s joke, giving abortion girls the ick, etc. He says he doesn’t watch TV.Why the hell not? It’s for you—and you’re going to obey it anyway.There are no good conservatives. Last man down.

                After 2020 I read a lot of Substacks and the like about the unaniminity of the elites, and how this is basically totally unseen in the history of empires. In one sentence, it was that all elite institutions and elites were on the same page in terms of culture, America’s role in the world, so on and so forth. I think yesterday proved this wasn’t the case. It is quite obvious that a subset of elites were not happy with the color revolution and decided to put a different plan in motion. When Elon Musk said that he was f*cked if Trump lost, this is why. The media loved to guffaw about how little X is supposedly worth now, but today it is pretty obvious WHY he bought it and it wasn’t to make money.So, ultimately, the institutions and elites have to make a choice now, either fall in line or go to war. The fact that they didn’t activate their shock troops like BLM and Antifa tells me that they chose the former. What remains to be seen is if the currently-victorious elites will seize the initiative or allow a #resistance to form and undermine them. I suspect they are too intelligent to allow that to happen.

                        Insert iceberg analogy.Thiel’s companies are the giants in the “total information” business. (They’re still out rounding up January 6 protestors, for example. The last arrest I know about wasten days ago.) Can you describe their logos?Elon bought Twitter to turn it intothepublic surveillance app, the one whosebrandterrorizes us everywhere, “X” as the dictator’s giant head on every favela wall. That hasn’t worked out yet, but he has found an interim use for it.I don’t think it’s particularly significant that all the “private” information you send him is funneled through an Israeli intelligence cutout that he pretends he doesn’t know about, but I’d expect /ourguys/ to think that’s a big deal. But they don’t seem to mind at all. Nor that the CEO is a WEF “plant” (wrong word, but you know). Nor…nor…nor…All for the feeling, not that he’s one of us—we all admit he isn’t—butjust to touch the hem.

                    I think that point was pretty good though.  Drumming up 10+ million worth of fake votes required a buy-in from all the players (and recall they killed the son-in-law of the Georgia governor to keep The Steal in place).  The problem though was that their religious zealotry undermined the reality in which they needed to rule so fracturing was inevitable.

                        He was the boyfriend Governor Kemp’s daughter and the son of former Governor Deal, but your point is well taken, and accurate. His murder was to send a message to Governor Kemp, who I see as more of a Petain-like figure than as a traitor, doing the best for his people while holding a wretched hand of cards in a game against enemies that are far worse than Nazis ever were. He used to be MAGA, and unlike a lot of the RINO wolves-in-sheep’s-clothing, I don’t think he was shamming it.The maggot people(first Puritans, then Jews too)have had the Southern nations of the American people under ruinous occupation for a long time, and use assassination as a tool of governance when mere intimidation doesn’t work.I hope when Pres. Trump gets a reliable federal investigative detachment up and running to bring to an end those who tried kill him, that they continue on and bring to justice those behind the other assassinations that plague our land. (like one of the Unconstrained Analytics guys who was shot in north Cali several years back, they were former NSC staffers who were all fired for being MAGA in the literal first days of Pres. Trump first term, but kept working private sector)

                    I believe the theory about elite unity was featured most prominently on the, “Fisted by Foucault,” Substack under the phrase, “turbo America.”
Say what you will about Elon, but his ability to envision the future is outstanding.
I will slightly disagree regarding Twitter. I think Elon envisioned a future where he hadn’t bought Twitter and his net worth was lawfared to zero, much like Rudy Giuliani.
Thus, the purchase of Twitter to maintain his net worth for another 5 years was a sensible, calculated risk.

                    But how many of these new elites are there, and what institutions do they control? You’ve got Musk, one of the most powerful men on the planet, Thiel, Carlson and perhaps a few others. But their satrapies are infinitesimal compared to those of the Left–academia, media, Hollywood, Fortune 500, etc.Now don’t get me wrong. The new elites are very important and they did yeoman work on behalf of Trump, and whether they realize it or not, white people. But they are still merely valiant knights fighting hordes of dragons with switches and slingshots. Perhaps the next step is for these men to begin building parallel institutions. They do have the wherewithal.

                        That is why seizing the initiative is so important. The #resistance was a result of the first Trump admin being staffed by feckless conservative losers and cucks. He can’t make the same mistake again. They need to purge the government of people who, at the least, won’t do their jobs. Especially in the military which was full of people who refused to carry out legal orders by their commander in chief. It doesn’t even need to be chaotic or messy. Musk provided a blueprint with Twitter. He came in and fired like, half the people. All the people in the media gloated that the site lost all its expertise and will die in a month. Well it’s still up and still working fine and still adding features (I actually think it works better now after some hiccups here and there). The company was just insanely bloated. Also, the people left knew who was in charge if they wanted to keep their jobs.Now tightening the company you own and tightening the federal government are two different beasts operating at vastly different scale but you also don’t need to get rid of that money people to ensure the rest fall in line. Most people just want to get paid and in the government want to make sure their pension is there at the end.

                        The emergence of a rogue elite is the biggest white pill of my lifetime even given the limitations you correctly laid out. They aren’t our people but they are not antagonistic to us, either. That’s a major win, and if they do develop parallel institutions, it could be a triumph. We may not live to see it, of course, but the emergence of the outline is yuge. Also, those rogues saw they also were in the crosshairs and didn’t like it one bit. Jeff Bezos, not one of them at least openly, just sent a laudatory tongue bath of a message to Trump.They know.

            It is looking like the only states Harris will hit 60% in are California (maybe), Hawaii, Vermont and Massachusetts.  Even in states where Trump did no campaigning like Illinois she is way off Biden’s numbers. She should have been getting higher percentages in some of these places due to Republicans fleeing the lockdown states. The most reasonable conclusion is that several million people had ballots cast on their behalf in 2020 and they weren’t able to do that this time.

                The only turnout that matters is black savages who count the ballots in certain cities. They didn’t show up in Milwaukee, among other places. Even low IQ animals could smell the artifice of Kamala, who hasn’t sobered up yet and conceded (very much like Hillary in 2016).

            One implication of Biden’s absurd vote difference is clear enough.DJT will be the46thpresident, not the 47th. The Oval Office is occupied by a pretender, but a pretender has no authority. So every E.O. signed by the pretender is illicit. Likewise, there having been no authentic president since DJT was forced out, no bill passed by Congress was ever presented to a president (Const. I.7.2). Thus every statute supposedly made by the USG with the pretender’s signature is fake law. I don’t recall if any statute passed over a veto, but if so it too is fake, for Biden’s veto was fake. Fraud vitiates everything dependent upon it, and this includes the Electoral College votes counted in early Jan. 2021.Much money was drawn from the treasury without legitimate spending authority. That looks like grand larceny involving a huge number of crooks who deserve humiliation. Other nefarious deeds likewise involve illicit conversion of gov property to the crooks’ own use. Take for example the shipments of weapons and ammo to Ukraine and Israel. Millions of immivaders were brought in under Biden’s watch. What happens to their status should Biden acquire a widespread reputation as a fake president and Trump chooses to challenge the immivaders’ presence partly or wholly on this basis?With an R majority in both chambers of the Congress, the Trump admin would be safe from impeachment should T adopt a policy of repudiating the pretender’s unearned status as 46th. Just say the word ‘primary’ to any impeachment R’s. There are at least two problems however with this reasonable repudiation of Biden’s occupancy.First of all, DJT is a still a golfer, not a fighter. Second, T would need the Republicans’ public affirmations that he is only the 46th, butR is a party of slithering cucks with no spirit for a fight. If T wants to show the world that he’ll run the executive branch like a typical R, he could hardly do worse than to continue to accept the framing made by D, namely, that he will be the 47th. Turning a blind eye to lies and other evils is the R way. If, on the other hand, the T admin can summon some courage and get organized quickly, it will drive a stake through a vampire’s heart. The D’s will be thown onto their back foot for decades and forever stigmatized as the lowest racketeers in American history. Every election will involve a hot debate about their manifest unfitness to hold power.

                I believe that’s,”45th”.  Trumps retains his original number, but is 47 person to hold the office.  This began after Cleveland.

            I feel certain that 2020 was stolen in multiple illegal ways and that many of Biden’s 81 million votes were fake. That said, I also think there were millions of voters in 2020 who were hysterically motivated to try to stop Trump, but who then got demoralized and demotivated after the kali yuga awfulness of the past four years.

        Again, it is hard to know about these things, but one thing we can be sure about is that we will not see another Donald Trump.
At least until several decades from now when Warlord Baron Trump sweeps out of the Catskills with his horde of marauders to sack New York City and reclaim his father’s throne.(Hey, it could happen).

            It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog. After his term is over, Trump can go back to being a successful property developer and has no incentive to kowtow to DC. This is his strength. Remember the homily of your fiercest enemy being the one who has nothing left to lose. One hopes he would pardon the all J6ers, clean house at the cia fbi and Secret Service. Pass mandatory retirement age limits or mandatory maximum terms of government service. Eliminate entirely the mandates for covid vaccines and don’t vaccinate babies til they are 3 years old. Defund the DoD by 50% and claw back half of what we gave zelenskyy. Drill baby drill.

The idea that those two have romantic feelings for each other is, frankly, ludicrous.

        Where did the 81 million voters go? Projecting, looks like Harris will end up barely cracking 70. And Trump looks to finish in the mid 70s about where he did last time. Harris breaking 70 would still be 2nd best all time for a Democrat, behind Joe, who evidently was just that wildly popular. Previous record holder was Obama with 69 million. So that’s roughly 10 million D voters, never seen before 2020, who dropped off the face of the earth just as quickly.

                    I hadn’t read him in a couple of years so I checked his page out at Unz the other day. Seemed to be a lot of baseball posts and the usual mocking of MSM for not accepting racial differences.
I think Sailer is happy being allowed into the mainstream punditry world. He doesn’t seem too curious as to why he was allowed back. Indeed, Sailer doesn’t strike me as a particularly curious person in general.

        A fascinating aspect to Trump winning is JD Vance. I suspect that Trump will give Vance a lot of responsibilities. Vance isn’t going to be the usual VP.
And where’s that a Vance, there’s a King Cobra! Interesting times ahead.

                        You’re forgetting about how Trump is the most wonderful-est, accomplished, amazing, death-defying, brave, cunning, strategic, entertaining, and famous man of our Age, though.
Basically he is Spartacus T. Kirk, noted neurosurgeon, wizard, rock star, fighter pilot, statesman, psychologist, astrologer, prognosticator, and author of every classic since Moby Dick.
Did you know he plays the piccolo at the concert piccolist level? With his toes?

I am OK with King Cobra as long as we keep him in his place as pundit. When the VP selection for 28 comes the same weird meme magic can be used so we get a double white heterosexual male ticket.
To be fair the warning is needed given the low IQ among people on ‘our side’

            Vance is the best communicator to make it onto a GOP ticket since Kemp, who nobody really remembers because he ran with Dole. If Kemp had been at the top of the ticket instead, he might have won (I have always believed). And before Kemp, since Reagan.

            A JD Vance with significant responsibilities/accomplishments seems a good plan as, if real change is to be accomplished, it won’t be done in Trump’s limited time as President.  A Vance followup is essential.  Problem is, can Trump suppress his narcissistic side for the good of the country and groom Vance as the experienced and most capable of Presidential successors in 2028.  This seems doubtful as when have we seen such in the history of the VP office?

                I wouldn’t have thought so four years ago, but even Trump knows that his time is running out. For him to have a political legacy, he’ll need Vance to continue his agenda. Trump’s ego might be a positive for Vance.

            Trump is self-aware enough to realize that he is at an age where the Lord could call him to the other side at any time.Thus, he had to find the youngest, most energetic, most capable running mate possible.I think Trump also realizes that Vance needs to be an active and influential VP from day one in the event that Trump is called to the other side.I wasn’t sold on Vance initally, but I listened to his talk with Joe Rogan and came away pretty impressed. He was well-spoken and had a good grasp of many issues. He sounded like a normal person, not a smarmy politician trying to get elected.

            We’ve come a long way since late 2016. Trump winning then did not make America based…it emboldened the Enemy to harrass, accuse, dox, and murder. Then some green-haired retard at Twitter decided to ban the Babylon Bee, and since then everything has been improving.
Now even establishment Republicans are using 2016 talking points. This is a good timeline, and comeuppance, and we should all enjoy it.

            The one interesting angle is the Dem party basically becoming the HR Department of the country.  At one point in time the party was ruled by economic leftists which shifted to racial radicals and finally: rule by wine-aunt.  Will Kamala’s loss push those kooks aside (in favor of other kooks)?

                The Dems transitioned from a working class party to a corporate party in the 90s (with the help of the Clintons). Free trade kneecapped the labor unions, which were the mainstay of the party. Clinton realized that the Dems could no longer win with labor union support, so he shifted the party to corporations and the rich.  Finance is the Achilles heel of “democracy” because it allows the wealthy to control politics and they have no interest in the welfare of the working man.

        “Less than a decade since he left office, he is a fading memory.”
He was a fading memory even while in office and even in his first term. Within a few months many (most?) had realised he was nothing but a handful of cliches, endlessly regurgitated. All style and no substance.
All that I hope from Trump the second time around is that he be a more careful and prudent manager of imperial decline. His success here will perforce be difficult to quantify.

        I think that you hit something with multi-polarity. It’s what’s happening globally and domestically. The 500-year rise and then dominance of European peoples and ideas is finally coming to a close. Trump seems to be last hurrah for that world.
Enjoy him.

            I think you are on to something too. If Trump is the last hurrah then he can’t be seen as a Great Man. I think he is a force of nature, but his lack of intellect and his lack of a real viable network with a viable and cohesive viewpoint is lacking.His UN speeches were incredible and eloquently written by someone in his circle. To be a great man he would have to be the leader of a large and effective truly elite group of men. Their aim would have to be, and this is particularly true given that America is the leader of the global empire, beyond America and about all of Western Civilization itself.Then, to be great, he would have to succeed. I think the next set of great men of Western Civilization, should there be any, lie farther out on the time horizon. They will be the ones who arise in the crisis not just of the Empire but of the people whose ancestors who built it and who are targeted for total dispossession, and by some, total annihilation. If they arise and succeed in salvaging something where Western Civilization and its people can regroup, stabilize and regenerate and not be some impotent minority then well, they will be counted as Great Men.I do think that Elon Musk has the position to be one such man. However, I don’t see it. These great men will have to think beyond the myopic tunnel view that destroyed The West. Namely, that commerce and technological invention are the sole drivers of greatness and that a civilization is a collection of self-reliant individuals pursuing their personal self-interest.I think Trump and Musk and the rest of the Thiel/Luckey faction are blocked by this viewpoint. Musk is young enough to continue his education and do something. I just don’t expect it. I also think they lack the will to assert dominance and control. To salvage this you cannot ignore the blatant treason that is rampant in every institution. Those people must be rooted out and punished commesurate with their crimes. I don’t see them having the will or the interest.Trump and Musk are a bridge to something else. Everything must be bent on mass deportation through economic incentives and on rooting out the cartels. That will be an opportunity to re-engage young White men in a heroic endeavor that is militaristic. Perhaps from those units some Great Men will be fostered and have the resources needed to rise to relevance and prominence. Without Trump or someone catalyzing this with the right project, this occurring becomes less likely.At least in 2024 those who know what is up have the mistakes of 2016-2023 to learn from.God bless you CoaSC

                I upvoted your comment but it came out -1.  Dunno why.‘I also think they lack the will to assert dominance and control.

I don’t see them having the will or the interest.’Yeah.  All this talk of Greatness in the wake of one election victory is short-sighted.  All of the institutions — and D.C. — are still in the hands of the enemy.  The Deep State, consisting mostly of women (feminists) in government positions abides, comfortably and without threat.  White men are still the Preferred Scapegoat of the nation, so much so that the corporations openly brag about refusing to hire them, on Identity grounds.  This is victory?Wanna be Great?  Wanna be a Force of Nature?  Overturn the reality described in my preceding paragraph.  D.T. made NO progress on those issues during his four years in office.Everybody’s high now, but Donald is an Eighties N.Y. liberal and a real-estate-salesman billionaire.  Not exactly my type of man, knowing little/nothing about living working-class and struggling to survive.  I doubt Donald even knows what is necessary in the country.  Is he talking about running the homos and race-hucksters and feminists out of their dominance of every single U.S. institution?  Nah.  That’d be ‘divisive’ doncha know!  The truth usually is.

                    Yes. When I wrote this I was thinking about this mixed race but all-black in spirit guy who openly advocates for total destruction of the US. He was given some honorary position by Tim Walz in the Minnesota education establishment and apparently was in discussion for being at or near the top of the federal education establishment. Of course, this is but one of tens of tens of thousands of egregious calls for destroying America as wells as calls for White Genocide. This includes the daily meetings by all major government institutions that are opened with abrogations of Our claims on our very land that are disguised as, “land acknowledgements.” This is open treason by countless government officials. Of course these occur constantly in corporations and Universities as well. This is open treason.I found out about the black guy in Minnesota yesterday when there was coverage of this on The American Mind.Of course the Claremont guys’ response is to talk about it and mumble something about the Constitution. When there is no consequence for this kind of open treason there is no going forward in a viable manner as a going and serious political and social entity.These treasons must be punished and punished as they have been throughout history. If they are not, then there can be no reform. You cannot reform a traitor. You can only be rid of him/her/zher.Trump’s four years must have as their hallmark:Mass deportationHeadway on abolishing the Civil Rights Regime if not outright destroying itA reverse purge of the American Military that is undergoing an ethnic cleansingMassive re-invigoration of the judiciary that includes a mass of excellent anti-CRR appointmentsPreparation and willingness to mercilessly subdue and crush riotsFor our part, just standing back and saying, “We are waiting”, in a whiner’s mode is not proper. We must find ways to exert tremendous pressure on Trump and the Congress as well as local politics to hold them to account.On the good news, our Japanese friends understand America’s situation and are speaking openly about it. How should I say this. At some point, in the contest for who rules Our continent there will be a need for such friends in my humble opinion. The period we are entering is the period historians will see as the interregnum where Americans realize they have been conquered and if they have any spirit left engage in a struggle to re-assert their sovereignty. By Americans I don’t mean someone with citizenship and a passport. Enough said.Here is a link to TAC that for once has a decent article.https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-u-s-must-allow-japanese-independence/

                I take back seat to no one in my reverence for the Gipper. It was the 80s, I was in my twenties, and life was good. Nowadays I wonder if it was Reagan, or just my life at the time, that makes the eighties my favorite decade ever. In retrospect, though, I suspect that I overrated him. Yes, his presentation was irresistable; he was smooth and confident, he knew the power of words, he understood the power of charisma. And he was a patriot, back when that still meant something.My favorite President of all time? Nixon. I love telling older people that; they walk back a step, like I’ve just admitted to a sex crime or something…Richard Nixon’s take on Reagan was that he was inattentive and often lazy, slow to follow an argument and slower to grasp details. Nixon, who of course supported Reagan as apro bonoadvisor on foreign policy, had none of RR’s charm, but his intellect far exceeded not only Reagan’s, but every President we’ve had.If Reagan was our Marcus Aurelius, then Nixon was our Hadrian.

                It’s too early to rate Trump.  He has four years and then a reflection period.  Reagan had “one big thing”—to defeat the Soviet Union.  That was it.  And no one can suggest that the USSR was not the major adversary to us for world ideological/military domination.Even when Reagan left office, his efforts could not be evaluated for a period of years until the unexpected collapse of the USSR under the Bush I administration.  It was then, especially through the Clinton administration years, that we lost Russia as a potential partner, friend, and ally. The Neocons just could not handle a Russia that was not a pile of ashes and a de facto USA rump state like Britain, Germany and Japan.

            He’s wrong about this:“The Silent Generation was a bit too small to have a major impact on society.”If you look at the ranks of ’60s radicals and some of the most vile people in public life even in recent days, a lot of them were Silent Gen. Dementia Joe himself is Silent Gen. Silent Genners are the worst.ETA: He’s also cheering on the Gen-Xer’s war of choice, Gulf War 1, Yeah, we kicked Saddams ass! Wooo! America, f*ck yeah! … Gag. Just the first in the sorry train of foreign adventurism and bullying that characterized the US post Cold War.

        The elites probably rigged the 2020 presidential election.The elites probably funded and directed the antifa and BLM riots.And once Biden was president, the elites turned antifa and BLM off like a light switch.
These observations suggest that the elites had a decisive amount of power and control not so long ago.
And today that power and control is nowhere to be seen. It’s hard to explain why the elites didn’t crush us like before.
I’m not complaining, but this feels like some sort of trap or deception, like we are missing some crucial understanding of the present.

                        Rebel: of course Abraham was a faithful Christian, because Christ was a faithful Jew; he preached Torah in Hebrew and Arameic, his mother and all his 12 apostles were Jewish.Of course Christ came some 1500 years after Abraham, but they both believed in One G-d during the centuries in which the rest of humanity (with the exception of the Jews) bowed to idols.Christ and his apostles brought the majority of humanity to monotheism and moral values.

                            OT is a series of stories of the Jews falling away from God, worshipping idols, killing prophets, and suffering for it— plus some poetry. All of this culminating in the synoptic Gospel, the rejection of Christ, the destruction of the temple. Stiff-necked people, as the LORD said.

                            Just as their Ishmaelite golem, Islam, tells the faithful that Adam was a Muslim, and to bring monotheism and moral values to the Dar al Harb infidels.Unz solved the mysteries Puritanism, Rabbinical practice, and Palestine. These are the stories of inverted identity, of a people imagining they are the other.But who are the Ashkenazim, really?Punic converts. Just as European and Arab pagans adopted an overlay of Judaic religion, so did the Canaanite, Phoenecian, and Carthaginian majorities adopt the Semitic overlay from their east.Palestinians are genetically closest to the old Hebrews; the Canaanite Phoenicians want their land back…believing themselves to be Hebrew!Where did the Hittites go?, our Whitney asked us.The Punics converted en masse as did the Aryans, Europeans, many Romans, Arabs, and Khazar.This is the power of the monotheistic God, the King of this world and Lord of Hell.Ashkenazi DNA contains only a smattering of Mongolic Turk Khazars, their original population of a few thousand were elites from the Middle East; the majority stayed behind even after the sacks of Jerusalem, mixing with their Arabic brethren as they had with the host populations in New Babylon, Assyria, and Akkad.Rabbinical practice has little to do with the Aryan-based Old Testament, it is renamed praxis of Hannibal’s El, Baal, Moloch, and Ishtar/Astarte.The original pantheon of the polytheistic Hebrews, strange, magical, sacrificial, and hermophraditic in its bitterly fought over union with their branch of emergent Semitic/Aryan fusion.These Punics became the Sabbatean/Maimonedian rabbis of today; they will come to the Americas/EU and become something else again.

Knowing a commenter is of The Chosen People is when they think Our Lord God is too good to even have His full name written completely out.
We must remove the vowel!!
What a bunch of malarkey.
But personally, I find it much more rewarding when we use the capital “H” when writing His name.
And on the Eighth Day, God created syntax.

                Well, I like the Bible (Old Testament in particular) as much as the next guy (goy?).  😉
Have you read the story of Sodom and Gomorrah as found in the Book of Genesis, chapters 18 and 19?  Of course you have.  Seems God would definitely have a conflict between those two positions (your quote and Genesis’ tale of God’s revulsion and punishment for inequity)

                        That was how it was interpreted up until the fags took over the churches.@Compscihad an unfortunate typo — they were punished for iniquity, not inequity. Though the word in the text translates most closely to “abomination”.

                            I am fascinated by the struggle for control over the true meaning of Christianity.
For whatever reason, Christianity has zero claims on my beliefs, but so many people whom I respect embrace it.
Does Christianity support political causes?  I could not be more interested in the answer to this question.

Nope. John 18:36,“Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews…”
Leading a righteous life will involve political causes, but Christianityper seis focused outside this world.

                            Steve, thanks.  Yes, I did type inequity, but meant iniquity.  For the record and Anne’s complete understanding, here is basically the definition/explanation of the concept I was driving at:“In the Bible, the wordiniquitygenerally refers to deep-rooted sin, moral corruption, or deliberate, ongoing wrongdoing. Unlikesin,which can refer to a single act of disobedience or falling short,iniquityoften implies a more intentional or premeditated violation of God’s law and moral standards.The Hebrew word often translated asiniquityisavon(עָוֹן), which conveys a sense of perverseness, twistedness, or guilt. It suggests a state of being morally warped or corrupt, often by persistent or habitual wrongdoing. In the New Testament, the Greek word isanomia(ἀνομία), meaning “lawlessness” or rejection of God’s law.Iniquity in biblical context emphasizes a hardened heart or a willful choice to continue in a sinful pattern, even when one knows it is wrong. It’s often associated with deep-seated issues that go beyond outward actions and reflect an internal disregard for God’s righteousness…”I cannot think of a better example of such evil as that which exists in the USA today.  Whether you are a believer or not, I doubt anyone commenting here doubts that we as a nation are practicing and elevating such perniciousness to a level heretofore unknown in this nation.  So, if there is a moral God, why would he reward such?

If your creed has words like, “He will come again to judge the living and the dead”, all has not been fulfilled. Or maybe He was just full of shit. Whatever you wish to believe.

                            Who told you that? He certainly fulfilled many of the OT prophesies, but almost no matter which sect you belong to, they believe things like the book of Daniel and Ezekiel and Isaiah still have open prophesies.
Only if you believe heaven and earth have passed away and we are currently living in Jesus’ kingdom, or if you believe all the fall of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD do you think all has been fulfilled.

                Anna is right if Israel is about to fall, that is, be greatly diminished like Ukraine…a rump state left to the Mizrahi, a gateway betwixt the West and the BRICS like Taiwan, and a still important gateway of both the Belt Road and numerous Southstream pipelines and shipping routes.
The Masters are preparing a landing pad in the US, and most likely hidden satrapies in the EUSSR, from which they can administer Islamic Europe as they did for the Moors, Caliphs, and Sultans.
From here, they will be close to their Conquistador baronies in Mexico, Central, and South America.

                Alright, Anna, since you say you are of good faith, I will condense six essays for you and hope someone learns.When God made a covenant with Abraham, He declared that “I will be their God, and they will be my people” as both a promise and covenantal condition. These covenants are bound by death, so part of the promise stems from the fact that the Israelites who break the condition are legally bound to die. Now Isaac was born from a woman who could not give birth and sacrificed to God by both Abraham and Isaac. On top of the covenant condition, Israel should not exist and only exists within the bounds of the covenant by virtue of an act of God. God is free to deal with covenant breakers as He pleases on multiple grounds, and anything short of instant death is mercy. (Ex 32:9-10 &amp; 25-29 &amp; 33-35; Nu 14:9-12, 16:1-50; Dt 13:1-5; Lk 19:14 &amp; 27)In keeping with the covenantal condition, Israel is bound to whichever leader God chooses for them after the pattern of Moses. Jesus Christ, their Messiah, is the final and ultimate expression of this. Israelites who deny Jesus are covenant breakers and are not God’s people under both the New and Old Testaments and Covenants. They are branches torn from the tree of Israel and refuse for the flame, completely cut off from their people. They are the Faithless Israel whom God divorced. They are the walking dead. (Dt 18:15-19; Jer 3:8; Zec 11:14; Lk 20:13-16; Jn 8:39-42; Acts 3:22-23; Ro 2:28; Rev 3:9)Judaism is the worship of Jews. It is in the name. They are Faithless Israel by definition and revolutionaries against both God directly as well as God’s sovereign authority over Israel. Faithful Judah and Gentile Christians should have nothing to do with them, for they are the antithesis of faith and Christianity. (2Ch 18:3 &amp; 19:1-3, 20:35-37; Mt 16:1-6 &amp; 12) They believe it too, for the Jewish myth of Lilith – who abandoned Adam in response to his claim of authority over her – is the story of Faithless Israel abandoning God for the same.America of today is cursed by any reasonable standard over many dimensions. This has intensified over decades in parallel with America’s support for the state of Faithless Israel that currently exists in the Middle East. A faithful, learned Christian should believe these are connected as America has been a close partner to Faithless Israel’s genocide of Faithful Judah all throughout the ME – Faithful Judah being the Christian Churches planted by the Apostles which absorbed all the initial Jewish converts in the region. Much of the Middle East was Christian by ~600 AD, and Faithful Judah survived Islamic occupation. It is not surviving Faithless Israel due to American support. Christian Zionists are beta orbiters to dark triad Judaism, and their psychopathic, parasocial sadism over ME bloodbaths is a significant tell.In the Christian view, Trump will not save America from anything if he does not get Faithless Israel to stop butchering Faithful Judah, which is possible if unlikely. Iran is very much positioned to step in and force the issue if Trump fails. A generally trusted Iranian source says that the Iranian government is in the process of doing just that since nobody, not Russia or Iran, trusts America anymore. Trump does not change that, especially since he only has four years, especially given all the pledges of military support to Israel by nearly everyone in D.C., especially after Trump foolishly signed off on the assassination of Soleimani. If America continues to enable Faithless Israel, it will be Iranian missiles sinking American ships and possibly cutting off energy supplies to the West in order to assert a new strategic order in the region. You have to remember that Russia and Iran are economically isolated from the West by our own choices. They will survive the collapse of the global markets, and everyone will rush to them via BRICS if Iran and Russia decide to take that route. They appear loathe to do such a thing, but it is also possible and somewhat more likely once BRICS is functional. You are looking at a sane version of nuclear war here.Finally, there is one sin that can not be forgiven, but more pertinently, there is another sin that will not be forgiven. Read 2 Kings 21 through 24:1-4 then ask yourself if you are reminded of Tel Aviv, Washington D.C., and early 20th century London. A work around is being developed for some, perhaps most, but not all. Look up the 3rd Secret of Fatima, and know that the Bishop in White is not Catholic. He is not Trump either, but perhaps this answers the OPs question too.

            The Regime worked hard to keep a lid on the boiling pot of economic, social, military and foreign relations problems as long as their puppets were in office. A big blowup is inevitable. With their Nemesis in office, now is a good time for the Regime to let the blowup happen. The next few years will be interesting times.

            Here’s a thought — maybe Donald Trump isn’t really a threat to elites. Maybe elites realize that he makes for a perfect Emmanuel Goldstein character (see Orwell’s “1984” for the reference). Maybe they realize that installing an obvious Affirmative Action/DEI candidate (Harris) as president would be a very bad look for them and would completely affirm much of the pushback against DIE-versity. Let us not forget that Mr. Trump is unabashed in his undying love for “our greatest ally.” I suspect he’s a better option for the true power players than the alternative was. Strangely, an over-the-hill and barely lucid White dude (Biden) turns out to more preferable to elites than a goofy mystery-meat lady. Who’d have guessed?

                They could have come to that conclusion in 2019 and not unleashed a color revolution on the people. I mean, that is basically how they treated him his first term. They know his character flaws like the love of flattery and desire to be liked by the same liberal elite he was ostensibly fighting. Instead they just went crazy and installed their guy. So, why now? Feels like they are out of steam and couldn’t muster the same energy.

            One hopeful hypothesis is that some of the “elites,” alarmed by the kalergi flavored insanity of the “left,” came over to Trump, enough of them to squash the effort to steal, and to get him elected. It’s certainly plausible, since we know some of them by name. Biden was sold as a return to “normalcy,” and instead his term saw a ramping up of the chaos which they had previously blamed on Trump. Opening more eyes to the true source of the chaos.There is a limit to how much insanity will be tolerated from any regime.It’s one thing to take total control as they did in 2020, but you still have to govern at least somewhat sanely if you want to retain both popular and elite support/the mandate of heaven and whatnot. That’s an optimistic spin on it, anyway.

            The difference between 2024 and Trump’s other campaigns is that this time he had at least a minority of elites onboard. What promises he made to secure that support is unknown at present (though we can guess).
Regardless, he divided the very people who rigged the game before, so that they were unable or unwilling to repeat the scam, especially given the worst opposition candidate in this or any other timeline.
Simply masterful.

                The shitty candidate they put up was really the death knell. In both 2016 and 2024. Trump was not one of the best candidates I’ve ever seen, maybe not even one of the better ones. His ability to stay on message, nonexistent. His unforced errors, many. I believe he could have been beaten pretty easily by someone who appeared halfway competent or honest. They just couldn’t come up with anybody like that. For all the talk about elites on this side or that side, the basic fundamental of having a good candidate still matters.

                    With the upfront acknowledgement that all politics are fake and gay, Trump just ran the most brilliant campaign of my lifetime. Even what I (mis)perceived as flaws weren’t. In hindsight, I can’t even say the outcome itself did not matter because if it had gone the other way we likely would not be commenting here in two months and the site itself could have become non-existent. Small beer, perhaps, but something to bear in mind. Along those lines, Letticia James must be made an example for what was done to Peter Brimelow and John Derbyshire.

                    Are Kamala’s numbers worse than Democrats usually get? Not down from 2020, but from “real” elections? I don’t have that impression, but I haven’t seen a count that calls itself final.
I don’t think candidate quality is Democrats’ thing, and I think they’vedecidedit isn’t. They pointedly avoid running sure general-election performers like Jim Webborbase favorites like Bernie. They install their worst shrews and morons.
The Party’s theme is disdain. Their voters want in on it—to be disdained and disdain in turn. “Good candidates” would be contrary to the mission. Someone in there has figured it out.

                        On the other hand, there’s Obama, the greatest teleprompter candidate there has ever been.What H and K have in common is both are women, both were given the nomination when neither had ever had to prove herself in a competitive race, because the Ds were so desperate for a woman and/or a negro/pajeet/whatever, and because in her quest for power H prevented a bench from developing.If (A) Hillary hadn’t had so much power over the party for so many years and (B) they weren’t so hung up on identity politics and negro worship, then they probably would be able to produce better candidates. But the damage H did to the party cannot be overstated. As soon as Obama won in 2008 she was the presumptive next nominee and no others were allowed to rise to challenge her, thus after she was defeated there was no one there to step in to the role other than the old husk of Biden.

            The simplest explanation is the elites (or the stronger faction(s) of them) decided Trump better suited their goals than camel toe, or that camel toe was really that bad and could Biden things up worse than Biden. So all they had to do was nothing and let nature take its course.

            I am genuinely surprised he won.  I expected the usual cheating and fortification.  Whether Trump is being set up to take the fall for an economic crash, who knows?  Whether he can genuinely do anything to help a cratering economy and middle class, who knows?  Whether enough dems decided to forgo cheating because they want a crack at 2028 (odious Shapiro in PA), who knows?  I don’t think like these people.  Trump can hardly be worse than the dementia patient, although I’m not happy to see the return of Javanka.

                While I’m not surprised that he won the legitimate vote, I am surprised at the ease of it, that it was called on election night, that nobody is putting up much of a fight about it (yet).

                Hard to tell if Trump is set for a fall, but the odds are high of such a fall—whether “planned” or serendipitous.  Trump takes the reins of a greatly weakened GAE.  No need to rehash all the aspects of such.  In short, America is not the same as when he first ascended to the office.As has been the case for many decades now, the Dem’s turn over a listing and leaky ship (of State) and the Rep’s attempt to right it.  After which, the Rep’s politely turn it back over to the Dem’s for more mischief (read looting).  My bet is Trump will be beset with so many problems that he will have little time to create any new ones.  😉

                    Dunno. I think Vance will be able to sell that a “shutdown” might be necessary for Congress to stop all those damn Continuing Resolutions and Omnibus bills. And ramming all kinds of extraneous crap into NDAA.
Vivek and Elon could also play a strong role. I know, I know, hate on Vivek and all, (not you personally,@Compsci) but he plays well among the civnats, who Trump will need to force Congress to do its job, assuming that’s possible.

        Trump is a heroic figure in the Greek sense. Denied his destiny in 2020 by the capricious “gods,” he came back fighting and won. Mark Weber misses the point when he says Trump’s reelection bid proves he didn’t really believe theelectionhad been rigged. In fact, Trump was daring his enemies to try and stop him, even courting death. That said, we cannot expect him to save America. Our government is simply too corrupt to allow substantive change. Trump isn’t even actuallyourguy. He says he’ll carry out mass deportations of illegal aliens (unlikely given the extent of corruption), yet bring in any number oflegalimmigrants. Whites are already a minority of the school-aged population in the U.S., so it’s a distinction without a difference. Also, given theleaderof the transition team picking federal appointees, how much of a shake up can we expect? If a new America is to rise phoenix-like out of the ashes, it will be up to the rest of us (and our descendants) to make it happen. That is, like Trump’s reelection, a heroic struggle.

        One thing I can’t help but add: Though I don’t vote, I hope to never see a female American president — of ANY race / ethnicity. Our society has already suffered enough feminization without having some biddy in the White House schoolmarming us about all manner of emotive garbage that exists outside the bounds of rationality. Even a right-wing White female president would be annoying in ways totally inaccessible to men. In a sane world, politics would be an exclusively male domain.

            Maybe the left/regime/elites are learning a lesson about putting up female candidates, if they are capable of learning something like that. Or at least about female candidates who are either haughty, entitled, and disdainful, or vacuous, vapid, and retarded. Truly two of the worst candidates I have ever seen.
But more likely they would conclude that they haven’t yet found one who is strong, independent, and brave enough. And stunning, that too.

        We may look back at the Trump Era as the great transition from the post-Cold War America to whatever we call the period that comes next. Maybe it is called the multipolar age
Marine Le Pen has expressed hope that Trump’s election represents the start of a new era characterized by bilateral cooperation between nations rather than dictatorial missives from globalist international institutions.

        Trump is a fine digression, but as said, “all politics is local”.  On that note, it looks like AZ has turned a deeper shade of Blue.  It is now nearly impossible to obtain office without an Hispanic surname. So goes demographic change.The aspects of what once made AZ a conservative forerunner in the nation, such as “Constitutional Carry”, “Charter Schooling”, and school tuition vouchers may disappear soon.  Our current Dem governor turned a budget surplus of a billion dollars into a deficient of $500M in the first two years of her term.  Of course, the “holy grail” of unlimited abortion on demand has been enshrined into our State Constitution.Barry Goldwater is spinning in his grave.

        I am celebrating. Tonight, champagne and a special dinner.What we have is a Thermidorean Reaction. The craziness just went too far. Too many important people and institutions were threatened by permanent revolution. You could see this when those with private, more trustworthy data changed course: Bezos, Musk, Zuck.Moreover, Trump is not just a single orange all alone — he has significant parts of the elite wanting to reform to keep the crazies out.Will we get our country back? No. That was never in the cards. However, we can move forward to a more prosperous and peaceful future which is not nothing.God bless America.

            Well said, Whiskey. It’s not our country and never was; we just happen to live in it. If our rulers don’t hate us, then life can be good. It’s all we can hope for, really.
The America I grew up in and loved was the country in which, as Eric Hoffer noted, an ordinary man had elbow room to live as he pleased. That’s the “old, weird America” supposedly loved by Bob Dylan.

        Hail Donald J. Trump! If it weren’t so early in the morning I would hoist a libation in salute and in the hope for his future health and success. He’s probably not the greatest American, but he is unquestionably the only great man AINO has produced, and may be the only such figure before this all goes up in smoke and ash.As for Z’s highly interesting historical observations (the Dark Age/Englightment observation was particularly choice), I don’t think there can be much doubt that the sixties, both the 19th- and 20th-century variants, are the key decades. The 1860s set the stage for America’s transition from a republic to an empire, and the 1960s catalyzed the subjugation of whites, the transfiguration of non-whites, and America’s transmogrification to AINO. The reverberations of those decades did not diminish with time. In fact, they resound just as powerfully now as they did in the 70s. But does Donald Trump betide the Great Reaction to the 60s? If so, he truly becomes not just a great man of postmodernity but a world historical figure of the entirety of Western history.

                I have only *one* hope, and it’s not for me, it’s for Trump.  I hope he uses his office to get rid of those people and malicious charges against him.  He could have “rolled over” and those charges dropped I’m sure.  He didn’t, so I respect him for that.  There are those who will never allow such a victory and will follow him throughout the rest of his life and seek vengeance.  The line from Khan in the Start Trek movie, “The Wrath of Khan” comes to mind:“I’ll chase him ‘round the moons of Nibia and ‘round the Antares Maelstrom and ‘round Perdition’s flames before I give him up!”So it will be for Trump.  He deserves better, despite his many failings.

        What an amazing day.
If the libs follow the law (HA!) and Trump wins the national popular vote, they might have to activate the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.
This would direct 17 states (CA, NY, NJ, IL, DC, CO, WA, OR, etc) to order their electors to vote for Trump.
I may die from a broken funny bone. Pray for me.
Trump’s campaign should file the paperwork in their respective state courts.

            This is a bit premature.  First there are not enough States signed on (last I heard).  Second, it certainly is not in agreement with the Constitution that authorizes Congress to approve all such “compacts” between the States.  Given this, any such attempt to divert electors will be challenged and immediately be decided by SCOTUS.

        I still would put Reagan as a seminal figure because the nuclear tensions with the Soviets were incredibly high. Such as the “1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident.” He got not just us, but the world, through a perilous time. Soon, communism was gone without a nuclear war.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident

                    Such retrenchment needs to be made in our thinking wrt procurement.  Our weapons are outdated/inappropriate for the new wars we will fight.  Overnight, we’ve changed from a feared adversary, to one that can be stymied on the battlefield at a pittance of cost.  Such is dangerous, since the use of nukes becomes, not the last resort, but the only resort.  High tech is too damn expensive, too limited in function, and too slow to replace—even when effective.  Ukraine has shown that future wars should not be considered to be simply a few weeks in duration as the sand wars have been.

            History remembers the waves of change that occurred rather than the ones that were avoided by the leading men of the time. The Great Man of History is the one who creates those waves of change. Second place for those who tame them.This is why Reagan is being forgotten except in the context of immigration and the destruction of California. The people who were aware at the time live with the relief of not dying in nuclear war. Everyone lives with the waves of change of mass immigration, and it is those waves of change that will leave a mark on history.Trump is a singular American figure. The man even had his own hero’s journey. The callow youth arose to tame the beast of D.C. only to be struck down for four years. He returns again as the hero he did not know he needed to be. Perhaps.The irony of Trump within our current framing is that if he is successful in taming the American insanity, history will mostly remember him as the odd American politician who ended wars outside of America. Think Teddy Roosevelt with a few more diplomatic medals pinned to his chest.As the cool kids say, “Life is not fair.”

                Thank you for that.  My thoughts and feelings exactly.  Going to see the movie “Reagan” summoned memories of my adoration of the easygoing, witty cowboy who faced down the Soviet Union and Tip O’Neill.  I have since reappraised him slightly in light of his support of the fledgling brown invasion and get-out-of-jail-free pass for the mobsters who run Big Pharma.  But he is still deserving of much honor, if for nothing but so ferociously taking on the Tax Collector.

            I agree that Reagan very much deserves to be remembered as a seminal figure, especially if you zoom out and look at the bigger historical trends of his era, even in addition to the Cold War and staving off nuclear annihilation.People are too quick to forget the demoralization that went along with the de-industrialization and de-colonization of the 1960s and 1970s. The same “managed decline” that we are fighting today was first planned for the 1980s and 1990s. JFK and Nixon were both taken out by CIA-backed coups. Energy prices had spiked and was in short supply. We were past “peak oil” and were just supposed to accept it. Carter told people to turn their thermostat down and wear a sweater during the winter, and that we should just accept the “malaise” of the times.We weren’t supposed to have affordable automobiles and gas (something linked to our independence as well as the American identity). We weren’t supposed to have a functional military or the ability to defend American interests overseas. We weren’t supposed to have high-paying blue-collar jobs, low income taxes, and a domestic manufacturing industry. We were supposed to helplessly accept the end of America as a great country.Reagan basically stepped up and said “no” to all that. Through charisma and sheer force of will he single-handedly extended the duration of the American empire for decades to come. If that is not the definition of a “great man”, I don’t know what is.Furthermore, he invented the term “Make America Great Again” and set the blueprint that Trump has emulated to this day. It should be impossible for any future historian to discuss Trump without first mentioning Reagan. To ignore his influence would be like discussing Julius Caesar without mentioning Sulla.

                Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul, in their flights from Empire orthodoxy, also paved the way for Donald Trump.  Yes, I know Ron Paul abhors tariffs and thought ending welfare should be the way forward to end illegal immigration, but other than that, his campaigns brazenly flipping off the Fed-financed Establishment were dress rehearsals for the coming MAGA movement.

Many of those were on the west coast and only needed to give Biden a big enough popular vote edge to make the steal seem plausible. You don’t need anywhere near that many votes to steal a few senate and house seats.

        Most of me feels that 2024 is a mandate for Trump, and it highlights how the 2020 election was stolen.  But part of me also thinks that possibly neither are true as much as I want to believe, and it’s more that, as America declines, people keep voting to try to turn back the clock to the last time America was more functional and sane.Anti-traditional America Jews conquered America in the late sixties and early seventies, and the nation has been sick and declining since.  By the Bush Jr years, we had slid to a pretty mediocre unsatisfying place. Some people voted for Obama hoping for “change” and to shake things up. After a mediocre first term, somehow he was reelected, perhaps because the media still had credibility then.His regime then really turned on the gay race communism, and by 2015 America was tangibly shit. So people voted for Trump. Commie resistance insurrection made those years worse, so in 2019 some voters wanted to climb back into the last time they America felt more sane, the Obama/Biden years, and they voted for “Uncle Joe”. But the past four years have been craziest and of all, and so last night many people showed that they want to climb back into the relatively sane Trump years.I think Trump is better with economics than the commies, and also he is not making it his mission to import millions of criminals.  So, his new admin will probably be an improvement in some ways. But, again, the nation has also for decades been a downward slide bigger than any man or group of man, so it’s gonna be a wild four years.

                        I unfortunately see no signs of that.  They still believe Russian collusion is real, I imagine exactly as the Steele dossier laid it out.  I wouldn’t be surprised if they still think the Hunter Biden laptop is Russian disinformation.There is nothing that happened last night that will disprove their world view to them – their conclusions probably are: 1. there needs to be censorship of X and other online sites more so that voters will never again be hypnotized by misinformation into voting for a psychopathic dictator, and 2. people were, rightly, ashamed of voting for an evil dictator and were less likely to admit such plans to polling companies.The one time that I have seen their certainty shattered was the first few days of the insurrectory George Floyd color revolution.  But Rachel Maddow and Nicole Wallace eventually explained that one to them, and they were back in the fold.

        People deserve Donald Trump to the same degree that they hate him. If the haters had sufficient self-awareness, they would appreciate the man for providing them with such a villain figure who enables them to justify their insanity. One senses that their lives would be somewhat less meaningful without him.Most of the folks who love Trump deserve better than him. Or maybe they deserve a system that is more open to genuine reform. They deserve a Trump who could actually be effectual.That Donald Trump is a “larger than life figure,” at least in a cultural sense, cannot be disputed. Whether that has any long-term implications . . . color me doubtful. But I readily concede that I could be proved wrong about that.

            This is an important point to keep in mind. The Western world has a tendency to swap ends very quickly. This happened with the fall of Rome, it happened with the Reformation, it happened in the late 18th century, it happened with the Industrial Revolution, it happened in 1918 and in the 1960s. It could happen again right now, and it could redound to our benefit. The future, like the past, is not set in stone.

        Some time back there was a mention of a sort of guide or index created by some commie traitor organization that attempted to be a comprehensive index of all the bureaucratic choke points of the regime. I forget what it was called but if the premise was sound and the index useful it would be interesting and instructive to keep it around as a reference to keep track if the new administration is having any success purging the traitorous scum and installing loyal partisans.

        Would that Trump really were one-tenth the “Hitler” or other authoritarian nightmare that his political enemies make him out to be. Well, congratulations Mr. Trump, you won a mandate and one hell of one. I hope he really will clean house, at least within the limits of what’s possible. It’ll be fascinating to watch and see if he is now smart enough to not allow his administration to be co-opted by the Deep State as Try #1 was. I’d offer him all sorts of advice. Here is but one: I highly recommend you arrange your own security. The Secret Service has been a bit sloppy of late.

        We a have a stay of execution on many, but not all, fronts for the next four years.No guarantee Trump will actively do anything good that lasts but its virtually assured that at the minimum certain things will freeze like deliberately blacking White neighborhoods &amp; the federal government aggressively trying to turn kids into trannies. Making laws to disarm the population will slow down significantly &amp; double jeopardy federal charges against people who dare defend themselves against diversity will more than likely stop for his term.The last four years gave me perspective, as much as I was sorely disappointed by Trump I’d would’ve much rather he stayed in. I’m going to enjoy the relative peace (relative to nonstop assaults on normalcy kamala would’ve brought) &amp; the seething of the subhumans who want to destroy the West while it lasts.Things can still go off the rails but with any luck Trump will blue ball israel like he did last time &amp; only throw them scraps &amp; hopefully he’ll give zelensky the cold shoulder like he said he would. Not getting my hopes up for that or any of the vengeance he promised, if nothing else I’m content with not having to see that cackling hindu witch or that White trash degenerate geriatric for the next four years. I doubt kamala will ever come back after this so that’s a lasting gift at least &amp; one I’m deeply thankful for.

                The best part is Trump now has a mandate.  And if he accomplishes most of his promises, it will result in economic prosperity and peace at home.
Lost in the excitement yesterday were the massive gains he made in deep blue states like New York.
if JD Vance turns out to be the real MAGA deal, we could easily see 4 years of Trump followed by 8 years of Vance/MAGA.
And a new political party.

                I personally suffered as a result of biden winning. The area I live in is permanently destroyed because of biden, I’m going to have to move within five years or less because property values are going to plummet due to crime.I have the luxury of time because I’m a few cities away but its already creeping in but all those people who went from a 90%+ White city are absolutely fucked &amp; are lambs who were both figuratively &amp; literally slaughtered. There’s already been half a dozen Whites murdered due to nearly eight different apartment complexes being flipped to section 8literally overnight over night by the biden administration.Also, I’ll believe it when I see it in regards to Trump actively doing anything good, his track record is piss poor relative to the promises he made.

        BOM started his first presidency under circumstances guaranteed to neutralize him. Primary among them, was his own incoherent agenda. He was thrown naked into the jungle of DC. I still think it was a vanity project and that his victory surprised him as much as the rest of us. Hillary kicked his ass in the popular vote, the Media hated him, half the GOP hated him, and of course the Deep State had no intention of lettinganyonestop the gravy train, let alone a vulgar outsider like Trump. His administration was plagued with quislings. Then Covid hit.But that was eight years ago. Trump is now a veteran of three campaigns and knows who his friends and enemies are. I believe that he’ll start his next administration with a loyal and sharp inner circle, wind at his back, a clearer agenda, and a GOP that understands that the Party is his.

            ”Hillary kicked his ass in the popular vote, …”Gove it a rest.  The popular vote as we all know is meaningless and was rejected by the Founders—who were trying to secure agreement among States (in essence independent countries).  The will of the people via popular vote was a rejected.  It is the will of the States—large and small—that count.To continue with this old meme is to play into the hands of the Leftists who have flooded the country with illegals, most all of whom live on the largess of this country within metropolitan areas.  If the Leftists were in the minority of the populace, they’d be singing the praises of current system of election.

        Just watched one segment of the View.  The memo has gone out.  The election is considered legitimate and no major rioting will take place.  A few Antifa types tried to start something in Seattle and were rolled up by the police.
So the rulers have made it clear that Mr. Trump will be expected to take out Iran.  If he won’t do that expect violence.

            Trump will have something he did not have before when it comes to violence: Unitary Executive power.If there are riots, he will protect police and give them freedom to crack heads.  There will be no George Floyd II.Expect a quick cessation of the wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Saudi peninsula (Houthis), and de-escalation in the Taiwan Strait.  Talk of war with China next year by the US Military will cease.  Trump will move to soft power.  Expect a military buildup in Alaska to defend our energy supplies.My wife was shocked today that the Dow was up 1,000pts.  She bought into the doomer stuff, but voted for Trump because of all the insanity.  I told her she will be very shocked at how quickly Biden gets reversed on energy, illegals, prices, and wars.They also seem to be quite serious about “the biggest deportation program in history” stuff.Trump I think is going to wash our hands of the ME and get back to bilateral peace treaties.  I predict an Israeli/Palestinian peace agreement will be negotiated by Trump.  If he can do that, a treaty with Iran is possible.America will use the next 4 years to re-arm.

        It all depends on what Trump does. If he’s muted, it’ll largely be remembered for that iconic photo and the time when America dabbled in jailing political opposition.But if he becomes a 4-year Cincinnatus, destroying the administrative state, the domestic Stasi, and vacating multiple wars while fostering an era of immense peace and prosperity…well…the country likely experiences a major inflection point.In Tolkien’s LOTR, “The Return of the King” heralds the end of the Third Age. Evil is defeated, the king is restored (legitimacy with it), and an extended era of peace and stability commences.Everything from Bush 41 thru Biden 46 becomes a transition period when America moved (hopefully successfully) from and expansionist imperial power to a nationalist superpower with a much more humble approach to world affairs.Last night was the end of our “third age”. Founding to Civil War (1st age), CW to WW1 (2nd age). The end of the Cold War culminated the industrial wars and battle with communism.Trump has to be careful. There’s a level of harshness required to ensure a proper reckoning on those who, over the past 30 years, killed and destroyed so much. That has to happen, and some must go to prison, to prevent a resurgence. But he has to keep control so it doesn’t dip into a revenge fantasy.I think Trump gets this. And I think he plans to leave behind four basic gifts:a dramatically smaller and neutered administrative statea new Pax AmericanusAmerica first prosperityfree, fair, in person elections with ID and no mail in votingThose, plus the likelihood he gets to replace 1-2 SCOTUS justices, make him a generational figure. He has also formed a new political party and brought about the first important change in the post Civil War status quo in history.I disagree about Reagan though. He hastened the nation’s progress to the end of the third age by collapsing Communism, rebirthing and renewing American nationalism, and much as we hated living through it, kicking off what would prove to be the death throes of neoconservatism.

Glad to see you are aware of the domestic surveillance machine.
I Jsut learned about it earlier this year, and had an experience with it, as well.
i think even those on our side of the great divide do not know about it.
check out AmericanStasi.com
If Normies knew about this they would be horrified. BUT then again they also might shrug their shoulders and just go back to grilling.

                Most people do realize it, but in a different context.  Everyone has a story about saying they’re interested in buying something, then, inexplicably, they start getting emails about it.  Or they click a link, and it’s full of ads selling the thing they talked about or mentioned in a random email.
Most people haven’t had the Stasi show up at their door.  But everyone knows they’re being watched.

        If Trump loads up his administration with warmongers and corporate toadies (as he did last time), we are screwed. The transition period will tell the tale. Keep your fingers crossed that he learned something from his first administration. Meanwhile, enjoy the Schadenfreude as the usual suspects wail and gnash their teeth.

            I think Eric, Don, Jr., Tulsi, and Bobby are going to run a tight ship as far as appointees.  Pompeo will be a litmus test.  The gold standard will be keeping Jared “Beachfront Luxury Gaza Condos For Sale” Kushner and Ivanka the hell out of there.

        Well, I’ve watched the gang over at MSNBC and found out the reason that Kamala lost: an evil brew of sexism, racism, and misogyny. You see, people don’t vote on issues, or competence, oh no; it’s all about their hatreds, their inner demons…It’s like they are pounding their heads against the wall because they didn’t call Trump ‘Hitler’ enough. Like they were too even-handed, that the message wasn’t broadcast with sufficient force and clarity.Good to see that our adversaries learn from defeat.**Of course, it’s a treat to see Al Sharpton (the ‘reverend’, as Joe Scarborough addresses him) expatiate on the moral failings of latino and black men, on top of the usual condemnation of white guys. Turns out that we “haters” are a multi-racial community.

            The popular vote just floored them.  They have no narrative to fall back on.  Trump’s victory was nationwide and across all demographic groups.  Gen Z went for him +10%.Antifa/BLM is mainly millennials who are getting too old for that stuff.The courts and the bureaucracy are now walled off to the #resistance.  Firings, lots of firings, are coming.  And it looks like Congress is not a threat.  So they’ve lost that weapon.The state run media has so be-clowned itself that Trump could ban them all from the WH and the public would cheer.Lawfare is about to get a proctological exam.On Bannon’s show today, they suggested NGO’s will fill the breach. But NGO’s live off donors.  Send a few IRS auditors and regulators sniffing around, and the NGO’s will dry up.Right now…they’ve got no weapons, old troops, and a demoralized and decapitated leadership…

        it’s weird that i think this since we still have four more years of him but it feels like the end of an era since we’ll never see Trump on the ballot again. It reminds me of a paragraph of a book I read about jefferson airplane when they broke up in 1972:“It was time for the airplane to touch down. The city that had birthed them had changed – the Haight was in shambles, a ghost town populated by hard-drug burnouts, charlatans and opportunists. Many of the young people who had been on the front lines in the 60s lost interest in political involvement and true exploration, while holding on to other trappings of the counterculture – the rock music, the drugs, the long hair.”

        I have to say I wasn’t shocked like 2016, more like just relieved that step one is out of the way.  Now he needs to get down to serious bidness – and get stuff done, with maybe a little retribution here and there on the side – maybe a lot. In the meantime, I’m going to deliciously enjoy libshit wailing, salty tears and gnashing of teeth…

The uninflated total vote count demonstrates that contrary tomisinformation peddled by Musket al., “migrants” aren’t here to vote.
We know they’re not here for traditional large-scale economic reasons—to bubble The Economy™ for the profit of its majority owners, or to sustain the entitlement budget—because their “macro” effect isruinous.
So.

        I don’t hate Kamala Harris. She’s easy on the eye. A DEI simpleton who sucked her way to the top. As her own husband pointed out just a couple of nights ago, when necessary she puts her head down and goes to work. Everyone has their talent and – as an old buddy of mine, a released convict, used to say – “you do what you gotta do”. I mean, she grew up in a working-class family the way the rest of us did, and…So, Kamala passes into the footnotes of history. Meanwhile, talking about hatred, that senile old prick who still happens to be President, there is someoneI hate. I am 64 and I have had to be subjected to this ridiculous and stupid man since he first tried for the presidency in 1988; his “victory” in 2020 is now exposed as a fraud, and one assumes he shits his pants like a baby. Good, Fuck him.

        That which was true before the election is true now. Our enemies still hate us and the government is over run with whack jobs and vibrant incompetents. I worry that the normies will try and find common ground with the Dems and deep state moles. They always do. There was a post on Breitbart about all the Kammy creatures crying at her (hopefully) farewell speech. Many felt bad and posted so….I replied that these people would all happily put them in a re-education camp had Harris won. My hope is that Trump brings in enough hard right technocrats that burn through the various levels of government and ferret out these people. I work for the DoD and do very little for quite a bit so I volunteer to review records.

        Great Men often rely on circumstances to get them lift off the ground. Napoleon had the chaos of the French Revolution; Hitler had the desperation of the Great Depression. Trump might have something terrible of his own: the collapse of the national debt load.We are very near an inflection point in terms of debt. Trump is old enough to have lived through New York’s financial crisis of the 1970s. That mess was straightened out, but this one is much more gigantic.Trump has already floated a debt repayment idea of paying pennies on the dollar to creditors. What that might do is usher in a total collapse of the world financial system as other nations follow suit, and individual credit card holders copy both. The social disturbances would be terrible. But it might give Trump a chance to rise to a self-inflicted moment of greatness.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

A force of nature, no doubt.

            Donald Trump was a world famous man before he started his political career in his sixties. He’s done three presidential campaigns, won all of them in an honest count, has been almost killed by an assassin, has had his home raided by the FBI, has spent countless hours in courtrooms being charged with bogus crimes and stripped of much of his wealth, and now, at 78 (78!) has become only the second GOP candidate since 1988 to win the popular vote. He is without question the most famous and consequential man of our age. And he’s done it, basically, all on his own.And you find that silly? I can’t think of many analogies from history. Napoleon comes to mind – but even then, only if he hadwonat Waterloo. Which is, in a way, what the Donald did last night.

                Even a hurricane flood couldn’t stop the guy or his base.
If that was a weather weapon revealed, then they dropped their Hiroshima Fat Boy and it made not a dent. Force of nature indeed!

                Hey if he’s a superhuman force-of-nature hero to y’all, so be it.
But ‘No one has seen or will ever see a force of nature like this man.’  That is silly hyperbole.  Heck my dad was a better man that DJT.

                    The good are rarely great, and the great are rarely good. Your dad, I’m sure, was good (so was mine). But Trump is great.
