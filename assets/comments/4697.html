        [‚Ä¶] This is where American women find themselves after a century of feminism. The role models for their daughters are lesbians and lunatics, but no one is allowed to mention that these women are lesbians and lunatics.  [‚Ä¶]

        Good thing her parents named her Hope instead of Chastity, because there is enough cheesecake of her on the data autostrada to cover the walls of about a dozen college dorm rooms.

        A personal note, if I may. Men love dangerous women, bi or straight. I am an older, very conservative (politically speaking) male.  Hope could fly everywhere with me if she wished. Proper medication might be warranted. Best regards everyone.
