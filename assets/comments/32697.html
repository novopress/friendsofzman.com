        Another aspect I think must be considered, while less cool and not easy to put into an Excel spreadsheet, is the psychological effects of this new style of warfare. Can you imagine the paranoia of knowing that wherever you are a drone might be watching you. Not just the outposts in no-man’s land, not just the main lines or even the rear area, but tens of miles away. And it is not just a drone watching you like an Eye of Sauron, but capable of vectoring in missiles, artillery, or depending on the model, it swoops in and does the job itself. I don’t know about you, but I can see myself developing eye and ear strain or some sort of nervous tic from constantly scanning the sky for odd-shaped dots or listening for the whir of little propellers. It used to be once you were out of artillery range you were generally safe. Obviously there is the threat of aircraft but you could be reasonably sure anti-aircraft defenses and your own airforce would at least contest an enemy in your airspace. But now? Nowhere is safe.The other consideration in this psychological effect, of fear and paranoia, is as mentioned by Z-Man, cost. Something insanely cheap can be psychologically devastating in the nagging, constant little worry in the back of someone’s mind it generates. The best example I heard was when someone asked a question concerning anti-tank mines:Question: How many anti-tank mines would it take to stop an armored column?Answer: None. Just put up a sign that says “DANGER: MINEFIELD”Even cheaper than a drone to stop a column of tanks, a marker and a piece of cardboard nailed to a tree. It is most likely fake, probably. Odds are someone is trying to mess with you. But… what if it is legit? Do you roll your tank through and suddenly get inducted into the Turret Toss Olympics? Or do you stop and call up the engineers? Does the enemy have a drone watching this area while you try to decide? Was the delay long enough that artillery shells are already on the way? Maybe this is the fifth same sign you’ve seen on this road and all the other ones were fake. Is this one the same, or real this time? On and on it goes…

            Snipers are famously hated by their enemies and are dealt with harshly when caught.
I’d expect the same for drone operators.

That means every sixth person you see today is an informer (a spy).

                The Brits (well, at least of them)  murdered submariners in the world wars.  They basically could not surrender.  The Brits thought they were not honorable because their methods involved stealth.

            I think you are forgetting one thing. If nowhere is safe, not even the backlines, then liquidating an entire enemy government suddenly becomes economically feasible in a way that doesn’t leave a bunch of glowing craters. I don’t just mean military personnel.
Drone quarantine, anyone?
Total war is gonna look a lot more “total” in the future me thinks.

                    You don’t need to kill everyone, you merely need to kill enough and show the rest are permanently, personally vulnerable to bring them to the negotiating table. This won’t work on warlords and men with balls or those in an honor culture. But we got rid of all that.

                    I think the idea would be to send a large cruise missile or heavy drone packed with explosives into the enemy’s parliament while it was in session. Then you hope someone in the enemy military steps into the power vacuum and starts talking directly with the enemy. The Ukraine situation is practically made for this strategy. You’ve got a totally fake “Ukrainian” government that hides in bunkers or Western redoubts while the military can see the slaughter up close. A related idea would be to talk directly to sensible military people and encourage them to mount a coup. Who knows, the Russians may be doing that already.

                Yep. A successful drone attack on Trump would herald a new world, in which consequential leaders essentially could not appear in public. They would all be Hitler in the bunker.
It would also increase the theatricality of politics, where the “elected” representatives are mere figureheads for hidden men behind the curtain, so assassinations would affect neither the policy or continuity of government. Kamalas are a dime a dozen.

                    Every national leader would eventually become Big Brother both in the traditional “all-seeing watchful eye” sense and in the sense of just being a remote figure on a screen, a face in the newspaper, or an icon on a poster.

            Saw a video purportedly showing off an anti-drone weapon in use by Russians.  Whether true or not, it seems logical that before this war is over, those type of defensive weapons against drones will be in use.  Hard to imagine our MIC is not now working feverishly on such things,

                    Yep, I was gonna say shotguns might be made illegal before AR-15’s.  😉
But actually, these drones fly pretty high and pretty fast—even for an experienced skeet shooter to handle.

            I would think being watched from the eye in the sky has been there for quite some time.  The classified pictures from satellites is supposed to be very good and that individuals are easily discernible as being an individual, though you may or may not be able to make out a face.  Who knows?  Perhaps we even have real time high res satellite video?What happened was a long period of relative peace among near-peer powers.  As recently as 2021, there was endless droning about how this old form of warfare was obsolete and near-peer war was over and how we need to spend on 4th generation warfare.  In just 3 short years, the US now wants peer wars against Russia, China and Iran and probably others I don’t know about.

                I remember listening to NPR in a past life, there was some bigwig terris got droned. They were bragging about how it got done.
Iirc, the story was that he was suspected to be in a certain house. A satellite bounced lasers off the windows. From vibrations in the glass, they were able to reconstruct conversation going on inside and voice ID the guy. I want to say this was 2006-08 or something like that.
Incidentally, that was when I realized NPR absolutely glows.

            This goes both ways.  Drones do enhance the illusion of control, upon which globalism depends.But asymetric analog struggle — like a truck bomb destroying Chicago’s ability to chlorinate its water supply — shatters this illusion and undermines the real source of regime strength, the money power.Imagine the terror when all the king’s drones and all the king’s men cannot prevent a rolling serious of similar attacks, or stopa murder of crow-sized drones from blowing the heads off General X or Judge Y or Celebrity Z, right in their driveway.  Especially if signs point towards Tehran or Kiev or the Gulf Cartel.

I think that the more interesting Ukrainian angle is that Trump was impeached for threatening to withhold funds to Ukraine on the testimony of a Jewish-Ukrainian officer in the U.S. Army… and that a pro-Ukraine nut who tried to recruit people to fight for Ukraine just tried to shoot him the other day.
How ’bout them apples, Z?

Now as a human being, he is without a doubt, odious.

                Disagree.  Every commander must be held accountable for being caught “flat-footed”.  It’s his job to be one step ahead of the enemy.  There is an old precept that was taught in the days of mandatory ROTC in university, (as an officer) “You can delegate ‘authority’, but you can never delegate ‘responsibility’!”Milley remained unscathed because he was a toady for the Left’s new woke military efforts and it was only Uke’s that died in the failed offensive cited by Z-man.  I will note however he retired in Sept 2023 when the Ukrainian project was finally seen by all to be fruitless.

                    I don’t know if that’s reality, though. How many times in history have we had something new thrown at us in war and it has taken us time to adjust? I’m lenient when it comes to instant adjustment to something new. Of course, there is a point at which repeated failure gets you replaced, but I’m not sure that a single miscalculation does that.

                Milley, not surprisingly, lacked intelligence, boldness and imagination.  That’s how he climbed the greasy pole:  Being a toady, yes-man, agreeing with whatever was the acceptable conventional answer.
If he had shown an imagination he would have been General Flynn.

                Everyone here has worked with a Milley at least once probably more. The guys who climb the ladder by trampling those below them and at their level, who brownnose and ass-kiss and suck up to those above. Even though it’s apparent that they have no talent, they know how to play the game and that is good enough.Always remember that the military is now just another large corporation with all its flaws, it’s no longer a place for warriors and we will pay dearly if they keep on pushing Russia and China. Hell, without using nukes, we can’t beat Iran or NK now.By the way, I use we because that’s where I am, not because I have a bit of patriotism left.

            If true, that’s a break with at least 80 years of GAE military norms. Chief of staff was ostensibly just an advisor to the president, not in the operational chain of command. Of course it’s not technically a US operation, and Dotmil is so top heavy now, who can really say anymore.

                Milley was Chief of Staff *until* 2019 for the Army, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff until 2023.  But I readily admit to no knowledge of exactly what his duties were in those two positions—only some of his onerous praise of DEI in the forces.  He looked like so many of those soy boys we so decry here.Compare Milley to “mad dog” Mathis who famously said, “Nothing keeps me awake at night, I keep others awake at night”, a retired U.S. Marine Corps general and former Secretary of Defense.But even if solely to advise the President, what is the difference?  The aspect of warfare had basically changed from what was successful in the sand wars.  Iran knew this and created an entire strike force of cheap, suicide drones to counter the US military technology.  They had so many, they could sell them to the Russians when Putin came “a knocking”.  Also “hypersonic” missile technology was perfected by both the Russians *and* Chinese, while we still seem not to have such.  I note here that even Z-man did not think this was possible at the time—but he’s been proven wrong by their effective use in Ukraine.These things/developments may or may not have been revealed to Trump at the time, but if not, then there was a very large breakdown in our system.  Hypersonic missiles have rendered our carrier fleet ineffective.  Drones our tanks.  Antiaircraft systems, of which the Russians have been famous for, our fighters—at least for ground attack purposes.  Who the hell knows what we may learn about our vaunted submarine fleet?It’s one thing to over pay for military—but effective—hardware, another thing to purchase overpriced useless junk which lull us into complacency and increase to odds of last resort use of nukes.

        First, with respect to the Ukraine War, Russia has the means to destroy the energy infrastructure and turn off the lights and heat throughout the country, and this would end the war quickly. Both electrical and natural gas systems utilize large precision equipment (generators, turbines, and compressors) that take years to replace once damaged beyond repair. Russia is degrading (but not destroying) this equipment because its goal is demilitarization of NATO and a long, slow war serves that purpose best.With respect to drone war in future civilian-based conflicts, asymmetry matters. Rebels are elusive and numerous, the Elites are few and fragile. Yes, the jackboots will use drones to intimidate and terrorize normie, and this will have a chilling effect on the weakest component of the population. But if the elites start falling one-by-one persistently, they will flee to their foreign bunkers before endlessly risking their lives and affluent lifestyle. The primary lesson of Ukraine is that if you become an identified target, a drone will eventually find you.

            Rebels are elusive and numerousThe second is generally not true until the end stage of the rebellion when the pleb and commoners start to join so that they can get their scraps without a threat of reprisal.Maladjusted and disturbed individuals tend to start rebellions as only such outliers can make a decisive break with the system. Proles can only riot and grumble to express their displeasure, but they won’t fight for an alternative unless convinced that the old order is going down.I agree with the rest of the opinion. In the end drones are just an another form of force multiplier. In anarcho-tyrannical societies those may buy some time, but without being able to maintain robust and competent security forces this won’t change much. The health and competency crises will nullify any short-term tech advantage in the long run.

                After the first half dozen oligarchs, they will flee to greener pastures. There are an estimated 20 million seriously talented sport hunters in the US. They are skilled in camouflage, stealth, stalking, and being eerily calm at the crucial moment. And most prefer to work solo. They can be taught to operate a drone and their range thereby increases from 400 meters to 10 km. And drones can be proficiently operated by anyone from 15 to 75 years of age. Militias duking it out with NGs a is high casualty waste of good men on both sides. Smarter is the focused geezer you never saw coming.

        drones are also following units back to their supply points, and then calling in air/artillery strikes on the whole group.
glide bombs are doing a shiton of damage too.
russian ECW is way ahead of anything nafo has, and is effective at neutralizing drones and GPS based missiles.
if this thing escalates, russia could destroy every western arms factory using non-nukes (hypersonic ballistics).  daring the US to go first strike, and lose it all.  much different math tan MAD was.  oh, and at this point the USN ceases to exist.

The idea is that the Big Tech Oligarchy wants to have a monopoly on the raw materials (chips, circuit boards, transistors … …), out of which any machine with computing built in it is constructed. This DBOR will include the right of all Americans, such as that quaint notion even exists as a formal legal entity, to own these components and have access to high-scale compute resources.In a dying empire and a corrupt regime, gangs and cartels will bribe officials to work around those regulations. Our people once again, with our principals and ethics, are in the back of the line in being able to deal with that environment. Not that we can’ do it, but … …In any case, as more and more invaders are stuffed into the towns all across Red post-America they will probably be more and more defined by strife. Mastering drones and 3D printing both the hardware and software and forming strong social bonds and groups will be a top priority for anyone who wants to provide for their self defense.

That said, if they can secure the ability for us to procure parts and equipment that should be lauded. Anybody who is doing something to advance along some front no matter how much they have permitted the collapse of other fronts should still be supported. In that absence, then we have to look at ourselves and ask, what are we doing to hold some ground or establish some beach head on ground that is essential for our cause.

        Very surprised drones haven’t been made completely illegal for civilians to own/operate.  If/when a politico gets wacked, I suspect they will be.
Building one with off the shelf parts is pretty easy to do though, as is disabling the GPS “fencing” that’s supposed to keep them from certain area.
The Russians are experimenting with wire-guided drones which aren’t susceptible to jamming.
This has to be a nightmare for VIP protection teams.

we shall see. Russia is operating under severe restraint; they are pulling their punches in the Kraine because they don’t want full scale war with NATO. In WW2 the war was over in 1943; but the Germans staggered on for another two years…

            The Germans fought bitterly to the end. It is clear at this point that most Ukrainians are looking for a way out. The minority of Ukies who are bitter-enders will probably be exterminated by the time the last shovel of soil covers the last mass grave. They trusted the (((internationalist))) and the penalty for such stupidity is death.

        Ukraine is turning out like WWI in more ways than one.  The generals of the Great War never really understood that technology had rendered a breakthrough unrealistic.  Even the great German spring offensive in 1918 was doomed to failure from the Eastern Front  not only by the lethality of machine guns and artillery, but lack of mobility and limitations in tactical communications.This drone stuff has everyone befuddled and it is costing much blood to learn.When and if the war ever winds down, what new horrors it will have spawned on the modern battlefield?  We won’t know who has learned thecorrectlessons until the next war, God help us.

        The Finns used another low-cost/high-yield tactic – dropping mortars on the Soviet Army field kitchens. And when new ones were set up, mortaring them too. Imagine how demoralizing it was for the Soviet soldiers to fight for weeks without a hot meal or hot coffee, especially in a Finnish winter.

        Off topic; Peter brimelow had an interesting interview with a young guy (a pod called something with coffee or coffee with somebody) not a bad interview except Peter is tough to understand sometimes. Anywho he introduced the following r Kipling poem and to the kids credit, he asked Peter to repeat the poem and explain it a bit. I don’t think everything in the poem necessarily is a copybook god, but the principle of common sense and tradition vs fads, especially philosophal fads, is really brought home. My stars if  anyone set up a knockdown like RK, I don’t want to know about it, my mind just may break:The Gods of the Copybook HeadingsAs I pass through my incarnations in every age and race,I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turnThat Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would comeThat a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said:“Stick to the Devil you know.”On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said:“The Wages of Sin is Death.”In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all,By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul;But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said:“If you don’t work you die.”Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrewAnd the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was trueThat All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make FourAnd the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of ManThere are only four things certain since Social Progress began.That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,And the burnt Fool’s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world beginsWhen all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins,As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn,The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!

            “The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!”
Kipling expresses a faith that many of us are depending upon. We believe that there is a reality and one can only ignore it for so long before reality asserts itself.
You can’t fund a country by borrowing money forever and spending more than you collect in taxes.You can’t pretend that men and women are the same.You can’t pretend that the races are the same with respect to intelligence and crime.
But for longer than many of us thought was possible, our rulers have escaped reality’s retribution.

“They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;So we worshipped the Gods of the Market who promised these beautiful things.”
Among other things, this poem is a repudiation of those who put the economy above the good of the country. Fiscal conservatives who surrender on social issues.

                What happened today is military history. I think it has to do with the batteries yes. And I think all lithium batteries are capable of that. Because this doesn’t add up otherwise. The pagers are probably made in China. And provided via Iran. How did Mossad get inside the factory or supplier unnoticed?? This is logistically difficult. Unless it’s a general feature.

                    “What happened today is military history.”
Unless it’s all just a lie, like the “Ghost of Keiv,” a woman fighter ace shooting Russian squadrons out of the sky.  The gifted storytellers who rule us believe that they can substitute the narrative for reality.
I don’t know.  Whom can you trust to tell you the truth?

                Supply Chain Hack. Bulk shipment of pagers either modified in factory (seems bit unlikely if factory was in PRC — that being said low value electronics like pagers increasingly made outside PRC in cheaper countries like Vietnam, Philippines, India, Bangladesh) or by diversion in logistics chain. Our various alphabet friends certainly have hooks into DHL, Fedex, and the various other air cargo systems.You’re Ahmed and you’re sitting in your harem of boys in the Bekkaa Valley tracking your bulk pager shipment on the web and it’s delayed because of a strike or mechanical problem at Shenzhen or Clarke, or somewhere similarly exotic you’ve never been to and only vaguely know of… Well these things happen. But what if the tracking data is lying to you and it’s all been diverted to some black site for modifications. How would you know? You wouldn’t.

        It’s not very far in the future when the regime’s drone army/air force makes the citizen’s AR15 obsolete for purposes of rebellion, separation, or regime change. It appears virtually certain that such a situation will come to pass long before the peasants possess any kind of sufficient organization that could enable armed resistance to the regime. It doesn’t matter which regime you are talking about, GAE, Russia, China, India…. they will all achieve this. That’s when secession will no longer be even hypothetically possible. Which, for the time being, I believe still is.

There’s the nightmare:  Walking cop drones.  They break down the door, shoot  your dog, your wife. and then you.  Oops!  Wrong house.
The only thing keeping cops on a leash is the possibility there is a semi-auto shotgun behind the bedroom door.  Once they have “Chappy”…

            At least one tacit assumption you make, which Z-man has commented upon, is that it’s a united power against the disunited/powerless masses. However, do not we muse that much of what we experience today is really the “powers that be” struggling among themselves for position and supremacy?In which case, one can indeed hypothesize support in any uprising of the masses, both internal and external. This support will provide all the means necessary to effect regime change. We see this today across the world. Heck we are one of the main instigators of such occurrences. In the future the technique will remain the same, only the technology will change. And we’ve not even delved into tactics proven effective in the past such as passive resistance.

                I’m having trouble believing anything is real these days. My gut is telling me that we are seeing a reenactment of what has happened before as their way of disclosing it to the public, so I don’t believe the second assassination attempt either. That said, the idea that somebody could drone a president or anybody else for that matter, because they don’t like him, is a very scary thought. In fact, I’m surprised the satanists in our government haven’t droned Putin.

        So, coming to a city near you. Just as sci-fi movies have shown many times. The movie Screamers shows the evolution (probably implausible) of drone or robotic warfare.
Imagine these things constantly hovering and taking videos and photos of all sorts of infractions. Now imaging the command centers run by npc human drones. Felony divisions, traffic, and all sorts of pre-crime units, not to mention the social media nazi enforcers.

            Imagine these things constantly hovering and taking videos and photos of all sorts of infractions.
People are not going to care. They are already aware their smartphone is spying on them 24/7 and still they are clinging to it like dear life itself. They’ll still cling when it’s mandatory that every smart phone comes with a few grams of Semtex, so it can blow your head off as soon as it detects a forbidden word.

            There is an easy way to make yourself immune to these concerns.  Simply stop being middle or working class.  There is little law enforcement against the very rich or the very poor unless they inconvenience the overlords.   The law is just a weapon for attacking the politically disfavored, and for oppressing normal folks and making us miserable.
Happily, as the dusky hordes destroy AINO, these systems will grow harder and harder to maintain and usefully deploy.  It will be a terrible adjustment to have to make, of course, but Panopticon will not be our worst problem.

        During the three years or so when professors actually professing to be postmodernists and doing “deconstruction” took over the teaching of literature, art, music, and philosophy, a strange phrase entered the demagogy of pedagogy:feelings of mastery.The professors’ practico-moral (remember “practico-?”) justification for changing the focus of arts teaching from the study ofart—aesthetic, historical, material phenomena—to condemning works and authors as racist, sexist, white male, etc., without having any proper understanding of them, was thatdumb students can do it. It was an accommodation to diversity, to stupidity and the rage it feels when confronted with “college material,” both objects of study and other students who belong there. But if you (diverse student) canjudge them from outside while you’re in there, youwin. You aremaster. (The “paradox” of blacks’ high self-esteem vs. abysmal achievement is basically this.)School is the pipeline to all professions. “Meritocracy” means excluding the poors. (Popular music complied with diversity-managerialism Harvard style: flatly excluding normal white guys.) So contemporary artistic production, except at the unknown margins, is crappy. This is not because of normal moral degeneracy etc. but because the standards of the artistic professions were made political to make the professionsfit for diversity. space_offramp.meme, but for the theaters, museums, etc. The switch—the change in management—only took about three years in the ’80s. Bloom’s famous book of complaints was a tombstone.There will never be another great painting, symphony, or building, or great book written in English.Everything is propaganda and garbage.Three years.Military drone enthusiasm reminds me of this. War is changing forever! How? To be fightable by fat idiots and “programmer socks” creeps. Some explicitly say that’s exactly what’s happening and that’s why it’s being done: Drone war is warmaking made fit for a fully diversified force. Rage-addled retards can do it from their couches at home!They can’t properly prosecute a war, of course. They’re Americans. But they can do other things—be given other targets for theirfeelings of mastery.

        Is there a “rock” to the drone “scissor” in this game of rock, paper, scissor?
Might we see EMPs come into play, perhaps non-nuclear EMPs (NNEMP) weapons, to destroy electrical and electronic systems but leave structures, people, and other life un-impacted?
I further wonder if we might see – – in another blast from the past – – more animals in the battlespace, as they are well-suited to these non-permissive environments. DARPA even has a “cyborg” beetle in the works.
I explored these ideas a bit in a recent post, “Rock! Paper! Scissors! Cocaine-Powered Pigeons“.

        The next step in the evolution of urban combat drones is to cut the wire and program the drone to navigate its way to the target without the use of GPS. The Russians are starting to adapt cruise missile technology, which relies on terrain matching to navigate the missile to the target, to their drones. It will not be long before drones are able to operate without radio communications. Thus, the jamming technology currently used to defeat drones will become ineffective.

        Excellent analysis Z, but one minor quibble:In the past, an attacking army would soften up the fortified position with artillery and air power and then use overwhelming numbers to overrun the enemy position. Defenders would likely fall back before the assault, understanding the math. Today, the defenders can attack the enemy as he is forming up for the attack and at every step he makes toward the defender. This radically increases the cost to the attacker, in men and material, without increasing the cost to the defender.True, but in the past aircraft could be used for ground attack against large enemy formations. Irony of ironies, before the Germans launched Operation Citadel against the Soviets in July, 1943 at Kursk, the Soviet Air Force launched a pre-emptive strike on German troop concentrations and airfields. (History repeating, farce, and all that) Indeed, since WW2 airpower as flying artillery that could harass and break up attacks, or hit forces massing for an attack, has been a doctrine of the military.But to your point, the aircraft couldn’t constantly monitor troop movements in the way drones now can, and the loss of a drone that costs a couple $Gs is less costly and more quickly replaced than losing an airplane and one or two skilled crewmen.This means Western cities will be thick with drones monitoring the behavior of the citizens. It also means gangsters and rival political factions will be using FPV drones on one another.The powers that be will never consider cheap technology goes both directions, eh?

            Modern air defenses have also reduced the utility of air craft in ground support. The Russians came up with the glide bomb is response to Ukrainian air defense. Ukraine no longer has an air force due to Russian AD. That is another thing happening in this war that will revolutionize warfare. Manned aircraft has reached a technological limit, while air defense system progress rapidly. This means fight aircraft is being reduced to standoff platforms.

                True, as I mentioned at Sev’s blog once, a manned fighter aircraft is the equivalent of a rare collector car like a classic Ferrari, Rolls Royce, etc worth millions of dollars. You dare not use for its intended purpose of daily driving or high performance driving lest it get stolen, damaged, or totaled. You can’t afford to replace it so it sits in the garage / on the ground / in a hangar since you can’t afford the loss.

        In the near future we may see soldiers leave the battlefield front entirely and just see drone-on-drone combat as the toys entirely take over. This will especially be true of nations like the U.S. who can’t stomach many casualties in foreign conflicts.
American military doctrine has been “Shock and Awe” for a long time, and it will be interesting to see if we can topple governments the classic way as drones make their return. Otherwise they will grow more dependent on color revolution.

            Just like tanks, infantry isn’t going anywhere. Every time there’s a technological breakthrough you have experts proclaiming “how the age of X has come to an end on the battlefield”. Russian assault troops speeding on motorcycles are a good example.Now we have a partial reversal in personal equipment development as flak vests and full helmets are back in favor and the increased weight of modern gear is now a concern.Tanks were sent to the military grave many times. The Global Chase After Mohammed was supposed to end the conscript army in favor of Special Forces-dominated professional armies. Then came the Ukrainian War which laughed in the face of all those prophecies.Drones are still expensive and we haven’t broken through in robotics in terms of battery capacity. Advances in guidance/targeting will bring in new propietary systems and restrict the unlimited use (like it happened with advanced rocket artillery and ALCMs).On top of that, last-generation MANPADs can target bigger drones, while counter-measures will be developed for the small ones. In the end, nothing will supplant the cannon fodder unless you make the land so desolate it won’t support organic life.Drones will develop similarly to the tanks or planes introduced in the Great War. First massed, then gradually declining as the costs rise while the effectiveness becomes restricted by the arms race.

                Tanks have been around for 100 years.  That’s a pretty short time to make a long term statement.  If we can’t figure out a drone defense, I doubt we’ll see them around for another 100 years, or perhaps recognize them in the year 2100. Now compare that to other well known weapons like firearms, artillery, and such.

        I completely agree that the drone is the battlefield changer and that drones and AI will be a truly horrifying combo. And lost in this will be personal freedom and privacy.But we’ve partly been here before. Why, at the height of prohibition with gangstere running around with Tommy guns and shotguns, did the SCOTUS protect privacy from near universal phone tabbing? They could have said “only way to stop gangsters is for the police to listen to your phone call”. Instead they said “probable cause searches only”. They could say the same again. But they won’t. It’s interesting to ponder why not

Recording tech, too, wasn’t so good then. Now all that can be automated, and IT sales reps and marketing VPs with stuff to sell are eager to tell everyone about it, esp. if the firm has aspiffthis month for new revenue or volume.

                Valid point but surely they could have gotten something with targeted phone tabbing. The more primitive tech back then would have forced them to be more targeted whereas now they can download almost all digital interactions.

One possibility: Back then the so-called Old Right held social and political power. It was effectively marginalized after the desired attack on the empire’s occupation base on Oahu, and virtually nothing of the OR remains today. The Bellamy Brothers won.

                    It’s an “arms race” to be sure.  The technology is perfected to the point that a tap can be automated to turn on/off when a particular voice is sensed.  Heretofore, a human had to disengage to avoid monitoring parties not permitted by the search warrant.  I’ve spoken to retired LEO’s and the discussions are interesting, but those people were old school and still had vestiges of integrity to the process. That’s why the discussion is interesting, they know better than anyone how the system is now being abused and “rights” violated!Of course, duplicitous people/agencies will work around such “minor” annoyances as with our spook agencies having reciprocal agreements with other countries such that *those* country’s spooks spy on US citizens and then turn over their findings/info to our spooks.Hell, even local law enforcement now does this.  Seems some agencies have recruited individuals and businesses to refocus their security cameras and turn over footage “automatically” to local law enforcement agencies.  So if they can’t get a surveillance warrant, they simply go to my neighbor and ask him to do the dirty work.

                            I admit to being a cynic in the extreme, but only for modern society and what it’s become.  There are really too many documented cases of honor and integrity in the past to ignore.For example, what happened to those drunken Hessian troops Washington “crossing the Delaware” attacked on Christmas?  He capture over 800.  He paroled them on the stipulation that they report to (I forget where) and turn themselves in for internment.  To a man, the Hessian troops did as was agreed, while Washington took his troops to fight elsewhere.Even a hundred years later, there are many tales of how the forces of the South and North handled their conflict in the Civil War.  Sherman’s march to the sea is famous, not for its success, but for its severity in attacking civilians.  Such were the rules of the time and perceptions still remaining in this country.Alas, it seems such times are past—and worse—such virtues remaining are used to our (White) decrement.

                            Stimson’s moral calibre was hardly representative of the FDR administration, he single-handedly stopped the Morgenthau-plan when everybody was gung-ho to just genocide Germany.
He was also instrumental in establishing the Nuremberg Tribunal which, at the time, was the alternative to unceremonially massacre 50.000 random German officers, a solution that Churchill and Roosevelt were partial to. His strange bedfellow was Josef Stalin, who understood that show trials were necessary to avoid creating martyrs.

                        Of course, duplicitous people/agencies will work around such “minor” annoyances as with our spook agencies having reciprocal agreements with other countries such that *those* country’s spooks spy on US citizens and then turn over their findings/info to our spooks.
Just so. I was rather baffled about the Snowden-headlines: “Alphabet agencies are spying on you too, not just Johnny Foreigner!”
Yeah, we already knew that from the Project Echelon-leak in the late eighties, when it transpired that the NSA had recordings of some senator’s phone calls.

        Good article, Z-man. The Blitzkrieg tactics of 1939 are no longer going to be the norm in warfare. Anti-drone weapons will probably be attached to tanks in the future in addition to  Chobham and explosive/reactive armor.

        Javelins are not only expensive, but they’re also short-ranged compared to the heavier ATGMs which are needed to push the enemy tanks outside their effective range. Ukrainians have often found more use for their own Stugna-P system that has the advantage of range and speed over Javelins.

        Let us pray for the wretched Ethopians in central Africa, that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Ham from their hearts, and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, Our God and Lord-Pius IX, the Book of Indulgences, 1878wgat moderns of all stripes don’t understand is that if Christ was god then he didn’t leave it up to the folly of man to interpret a bible he never commissioned himself or to make up conflicting Teachings . The Bible is a document of the Catholic Church and can’t be morally interpreted on your own to come up with conclusions opposed to the teachings of the church.so too with prayer. The above prayer promises  the graces Christ won to those who pray it. Now if the prayer is racist, abs racism was evil, no popecould have promulgated it to the whole church which the above prayer was.my problem is convincing people Francis is no pope. People see his hat and think he’s the popes he’s no more a pope than I am. There has been no pope since pius xii. It’s the only way to understand why the Vatican is so evil nowthe Catholic church never taught the races must be all mixed up and the church can’t change her major moral teachings or she is worthless and even evil and no one should have ever listed to her

        The Catholic Church promotes the curse of Cham as the explaination for the extreme differences in the races . But it has always said you have to mix them up and treat them all the same in a colorblind equal under the law government? The church where bishops owned slaves and never denounced that? No. It was so common sense that the races be separate there was no need to talk about it:‘Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.’ He could not curse Ham, for God had blessed the three sons and the curse rested on Canaan’s children. Ham’s sons settled Palestine, which they cursed with the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah. But Ham’s tribes settled Africa, and find their vocation as slaves and servants waiting on the white men. Cursed in the passion their father mocked in Noe, the African race love to serve as servants to the other races. Living since in deepest degradation, among them never rose religion, literature, invention, genius, or progress. The other races will not receive on an equality one in whose veins flows their tainted blood.Prophetic words the Holy Ghost pronounced through Noe on the sons who covered him. ‘Blessesd be the Lord God of Sem, let Canaan be his servant.’ Thus he determined that the ‘Lord God,’ Jesus Christ would be born of Sem’s race, the Jews. Christ’s genealogy shows him as son of Sem. He is the glory of the Jewish Semites. The other Semitic nations settled Asia, where they have remained stagnant, conservative, unprogressive, hardly improving since the patriarchs, for they were not blessed with the grace of change.“To Japheth: ‘The enlarging’ or ‘The white man,’ Noe said, ‘May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Canaan be his servant.’ The Hebrew has here for ‘God’ the word ‘Shekina,’ the Holy Ghost, who spoke through Noe and gave Japheth’s sons, the white races, that colonizing instinct, civilization, progress, advancement, innovation, superiority – the unrest of bright minds which down the ages lifted them to the highest prosperity, culture and refinement. This is the reason the white men are so superior to the other races. God foresaw the Jews would reject Christ, that the white men would receive him, and thus he prepared them for their mission to receive the Gospel and carry on the Church.”Jas Maegher, How Christ Said the First Mass

        Catholics have always been racist . The following is just a snapshot of mobberlys text:
The Colour of the African.
May not the colour of the African denote the enormity of Cham’s offence? Are they not excessively given to the lusts of the flesh as well as to the crime of intoxication? That Blacks are more ardent &amp; more persevering in their amorous pursuits than whites is not only shown from daily experience but is also strongly supported by Mr. T. Jefferson in his notes on Virginia.
