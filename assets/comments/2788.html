        Tyson is a popularizer of science, as you say, but not the active science researcher some people seem to think he is. Over the years he has published very few research articles in any of the major professional science journals. Mostly he does book reviews and talks about science to lay people. There is a place for such people, as the enormous popularity of Carl Sagan showed.  However, these days there’s no reason for anyone to make things up, even for its humor value. There’s an endless supply of humorous and interesting material out there in the real world for any science popularizer to use in his stand-up routines before an audience.
