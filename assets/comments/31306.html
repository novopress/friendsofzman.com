        Maybe uncle Donald actually want that he is kept off ballot and convicted. We presume that Donald want presidency. But if not? Donald never explained what the phrase “drain the swamp” actually means. Maybe it means burning whole Jew house to the ground ?

            More likely, The Donald underestimates the mendacity of his enemies and overestimates the integrity of the system.

        Trump will not be kept off the ballot. Even if SC sides with the Dems, the Col. GOP will simply move to a caucus system and the decision would be meaningless.

            I don’t think that I would believe that. After all, the GOPe is dedicated to keeping their little corporate, two-faced, Uniparty scam rolling, and respecting the voce of their voters has nothing to do with that. Moving to a caucus format would work at cross puposes to their fundamental objective.

            I really like the bit where they keep him off the ballot AND disregard write-in ballots.
Now THAT’S democracy done proper.
As for me, I am going to vote for Trump if I have to crawl on broken glass to do it, because F.U.

        Civil War 2 is a book written by Thomas Chittum, I believe in 1997.  He could see where this empire was headed.   He has a checklist of items, about 35 total, that will indicate Civil War is coming.  It’s remarkable how many of them have occurred.The 178 page book is available on google docs.  Easy to find, this site won’t allow me to post the link.

            Good reminder. I read that book a few years ago. It was quite thought-provoking. I’m thinking it’s time to give it another read.
I would suggest, however, that people actually buy the book rather than reading it for free. As of right now, the book costs only three bucks on Kindle. It’s important to support dissident voices, and buying their books is one small way to do that.

        Trump, besieged from all corners, keeps his chin up and is as belligerent as ever.As long as the Donald has supporters, and a mania behind him, he will fight. He will fight on the ocean, on the beaches . . . he will never surrender. *British accent* There is a good chance he will win, too. It has been commented on that the legal system in America is fundamentally fair. As long as this remains the case, Trump should be able to beat back the litigious assaults on his person and remain a free agent in the Presidential races. But if the legal system fails Trump . . . then watch out as America turns her back on it.(To read more of my writing, move your mouse over my name and then click it.)

        Imagine a divorce where your ex stays in your house, gains ownership of all your bank accounts and possessions, and invites three Mexicans to live in the house rent free.  You have no legal rights to anything, including a job or income.  Every night at 6pm, and every other quarter hour during the day, your ex gets in your face to tell you you’re a loser who really should just die because she, and the world, would be a better place.
That’s what the American divorce will look like.

            What you describe has been a thriving industry in America for decades.  Chiefly via the civil and criminal courts, and pozzed LE.
It’s just gonna keep expanding until either it is stopped, or the host expires.

        If POTUS doesn’t reverse this cockeyed ruling, then the national divorce gears up into a really ugly phase in 2024. Branding Trump as an insurrectionist means that he will end his days in an orange jumpsuit. Joseph Normal may come off his couch. I hope so but I’m not holding my breath. I kind of take it as a given however that POTUS will reverse the ruling, because don’t they understand the implications? If they refuse to take the case, then Joseph and Josephine Normal will be just as pissed at the cowardice of our so-called leaders. A voters’ strike would be the only answer (for starters). A vocal voters’ strike.

        I don’t believe we are necessarily heading for divorce, but rather a Third World two-tier model as we’re seeing emerge in California: educated, rich White/Jewish/Asian elite versus a mass of low-IQ Hispanic peasants. The poor Blacks and Whites either get absorbed into La Raza or shunted out into the tumbleweed wilderness of places like Victorville.

        National divorce is just the appetizer. Yes, it checks the boxes of being somewhat civilized and orderly, but its really just a rich man’s luxury in which the participants divvy up assets and life goes on, with perhaps a little more misery than usual. When hardship consists of downgrading from a late model mega SUV to a 10 year old Volvo, you’ve still got a long way to fall. Most Americans are still wedded to “muddle through” as the worst case scenario.But the models say otherwise. The rot that has been infesting every aspect of our cultural environment has produced genuinely corrupt and evil leadership in almost every venue of societal institutions. Those chickens have come home to roost and the fast phase of our decline begins in 2025. We will enter a vicious cycle of plunging dollar, exploding fiat, hyperinflation, and the exponential growth of CRAZY. There will be no gentleman’s divorce for long, and when it gets real, whining and pants shitting won’t keep you vertical.Prepare and get fit, or die. It’s not too late to get busy.

        Excellent post and analogy.  I make no predictions – I don’t think and react like most people so I cannot begin to understand their thought processes.  Given that I’m old, my political journey goes back many years.  My initial social conditioning changed gradually during college.  The change accelerated during my initial years overseas, and my political shift from the shitlib I was raised as to conservative repuke began then as well.My conservatard phase lasted from about 1983 until about 2004.  When not busy with first my overseas job and then with raising a family, I noted my changing environment with DFW’s rapidly growing population.  I watched the massive influx of east and south Asians, the takeovers of the libraries and schools, the death of English, the proliferation of shrouded women, and the destruction of our church by women.During those years I gradually became exposed to different viewpoints and interpretations of both historical and current events, primarily because I followed links and intriguing points of view after my introduction to the conservatard internet beginning with Townhall back in the late ’90s.  By following where all those ‘hate’ links and comments led me, I was forced to confront and rethink my positions on all sorts of issues, and either justify them to myself or follow logic and conviction to their natural conclusions.I’ve seen many others claim their ‘awakening’ happened with the OJ trial, but I was not surprised by the verdict.  But even as my belief in racial and sexual equality waned, I had not yet abandoned hope in the electoral system.  Then, of course, 9/11 caused an initial resurgence of patriotism.  But that faded, and cynicism gradually took over throughout the Bush years.It all came to a head (for me) with Obama’s ascension in 2008.  After warning now former friends and family and seeing no shared comprehension of what he represented and planned, I can confidently say my “shift” – my conclusion that America was finished – happened then.  Pick whatever other earlier or ongoing social or cultural or political shift you choose – the rise of the LGBTQetc. mutants, the trannies, the increasing push towards miscegenation and/or childlessness for Whites, the dumbed-down education, the erosion of standards – while all of it sickened me, none of it shocked me.By the time Covid cropped up and the 2020 election fortifying occurred, I was already a long-time political and social ‘dissident.’  The only real change after that was when a confluence of circumstances enabled me to begin to prepare for possible and probable future difficulties, culminating with our move from suburban to very rural this past Spring.It’s been a long and interesting journey, and I’ve been blessed by many people and informed by many superior minds along the way.  But I can’t say that my fundamental understanding of the human condition has changed, nor my overall view of the ‘average’ individual.  I cannot share anyone else’s hope or plans for either an uprising or even a communal rebuilding.  I can only work on best positioning my family for what I see coming in the future.  Consider it defeatism if you will, but I can only paraphrase what a far more erudite soul than I once said:“The lamps are going out all over Europe (and all of the civilized world), we shall not see them lit again in our life-time.”

            Amen 3G –While I’m younger than you are at 47, my journey started towards the end of my college career.  It all started with race for me, and I realized that co-existing was next to impossible.  I was still a civ-nat/conservatard until about 2008.  Once Obama got elected and I saw the shift in culture I knew it was over.  I used to wave my flags and love my “country”.  Now I despise it with the intensity of a 1000 suns.  I love my people, but I hate my nation.  I wish nothing but the destruction of these “United States”.The bad part for me is that I’ve been consumed with a massive amount of malice for the people who’ve done this.  Separation is not ever going to be enough for me.  I want them removed – permanently, with no chance of returning…

            You’re slightly more cynical than me.  I held out a very faint hope that the Trump administration might be able to pump some faint life into the system.  It was a fools dream (I even knew at the time) but really it was the very last chance to do something.  Like I said, I was realistic though, thinking of other past attempted governmental redemption efforts, I knew Trump would have to be a mastermind making every right move to navigate the minefield that lay before him, so my only hope was that it happened accidentally.It was a hope at least…

                Unfortunately, I doubt it, Evil. Assuming Trump arrives safely at the Oval Office in Jan 2025 – a massive “if” – it’s very unlikely that he a) has the political smarts to sort out the massive problems facing us, or that b) if he does, that he will be allowed to use them. There is no internal political solution to what ails us. The whole system has to collapse before anything worthwhile can be built to replace it.

        Btw, related to all of this, Steve Sailer has a hilariously stupid take on Trump getting taken off the ballot by the Colorado Supreme Court. Sailer believes that it’s a 3D chess move by the democrats to gain sympathy for Trump in the GOP base so that he wins the nomination because, according to Sailer, Trump is the least likely of the GOP candidates to beat Biden.
I’m dead serious. That’s Sailer’s take on this. It’s sad to watch a guy fall so far.

            To be fair, it isn’t unprecedented for them to promote Trump. And I happen to agree that Haley has a better chance of beating Biden than Trump does. For a lot of reasons. Not that I’m agreeing with Mr. Sailer on the particulars.

                Of course Haley can beat Biden. Biden won’t be the candidate, of course, but, yes, Haley can win.Remember how you CARED if Romney beat Obama? If McCain beat Obama? If the Bushling beat Kerry? If he beat Algore?What would have really been different?All over the “free world”, large swaths of the voting age population are outside the media defined “political spectrum”. A race where both candidates are acceptable to the “donor class” is a meaningless race.When Haley runs against Newsom in November 2024 as Trump rots in ADX Florence, maybe 60% of the voting age population will be outside of the political space BETWEEN the two candidates.I once had hope for Donald Trump but that was a long time ago. Someone will eventually say something like “I saw the crown of America lying in the gutter, and I picked it up” – but it won’t be anyone allowed to “run for President”, it will be someone else.

                I do not see Haley beating Biden.  Too many of the GOP’s base are MAGA, and they would see voting for Haley as treason to Trump.  Another fair chunk are DR and see Haley as the Zio shill she is, even worse than Trump (if that’s possible).  They will just sit it out, and with margins as thin as they are, the Dems might not even have to cheat, much.

                    Agree. As loyal as the MAGA base is the Never Trumpers &amp; Uniparty will vote Dem before voting for Trump. Similarly, MAGA supporters will absolutely sit out rather than support another Uniparty traitor. The only viable path I see for Trump is in a 4-way race w RFK siphoning votes from everybody but him. Highly unlikely but it would at least be entertaining.

            This is the comment I just left over there. To wit:
A lot of people still have apparently not learned the Tao of Steve.
This is exactly who he is. He is neither an intellectual, nor hardworking, nor deep. He was not cut out to be anything more in life than a goofy, jock-sniffing sports beat reporter. Everything he has ever written about “HBD” is just the sports beat, adapted for a more spergy audience. There is nothing else here.
Doesn’t anyone understand that yet?

                How long have you been reading Sailer?  I’ve read his work for over twenty years and something changed just a few years ago, and he wasn’t always as you’ve described.  Certainly not a deep intellectual, but not merely a “goofy, jock-sniffing sports beat reporter” either.
There’s also been a drastic change with Stefan Molyneux.  He went from videos about race differences and announcing that he’s now an ethno-nationalist just a few years ago, to his current content, which is Dr. Phil-tier.
Did someone have a talk with these guys?

                    I agree. Something changed in Sailer a few years back. He went full Cloud People.
He’s always been a system guy. I think that Trump and the change from discussing how to reform the system to wanting to abandon or overthrow it was a bridge too far for Sailer.
He doesn’t seem to like the Dirt People getting a bit uppity and has more and more shown his dislike of them.

                        For the sake of the long term stability of the reign of the Cloud People, they should have adopted a few of Steve’s suggestions.  For example, allow Steve’s IQ charts to soften the “different racial outcomes demonstrate racism” court mandates.  Instead, require the plaintiffs to demonstrate racial animus.This would have kept more competent whites invested in the reign of the Cloud People and they still could have pushed anti-whiteness through their media/academic hegemony.That they feel so compelled to suppress the truths that Steve has been helpfully showing to them makes me think that they hate us beyond the point of harming their long term prospects.

                    In Stefan’s case, I think he moved from anti-Christian, anti-FOO largely based on intellectual honesty — reality consistently failed to conform to the predictions his theories made. For example, those raised in a Christian home didn’t turn out to be as screwed up on average as those from an atheist home.
I stopped following Stefan a year or two into his “The Truth Behind” stage. Not for any reason other than life just got too busy. He went through a race stage? Was there a reason he left it other than demonetization?

                    Sailer changed with Covid. He always prided himself on being a numbers guy but was no longer interested in bad numbers with the exception of black crime. He should have had a field day with the bogus Covid numbers and the 2020 election fraud but completely bought into the Covid hysteria and had no interest in the statistical improbabilities surrounding the 2020 election.

                        Sailer went completely nuts over COVID.  I used to read him occasionally, but once COVID hit he started posting an endless stream of hysterical articles about how it was going to kill us all.  He all but ruined the VDare site, because at one point all he did was spam that site with scores of articles about COVID everyday to the point that you couldn’t even find anything there other than his rantings.  To this day, I seldom bother to surf over to that site.

                    How long have I read Sailer? Well, I’ve never been an avid reader of Sailer in the sense that I considered him someone worth learning from. I’ve been vaguely aware of him ever since about 2005, but I didn’t start commenting on his blog until 2015, and then only because the older, more sophisticated Traditional Right blogs from the early days of the internet had by that time all closed down or changed ownership. It was quite sad, really. Even a “mainstream” site like First Things used to have edgier, more sophisticated material in itscommentsthan Unz Review has in itscolumns.And the independent blogs like The Long View and The Daily Reckoning Forum (back when they were phpbb-powered dinosaurs) were an absolute paradise compared to anything that exists today. Alas, those halcyon days are gone.So, I started commenting at Sailer’s because I ran out of options, but I’ve never liked him. The first writing I ever read of his was the piece that probably still remains today his most famous essay,Is Love Colorblind?That experience was quite distasteful to me in a way I find difficult to describe. It was not because I disagreed with HBD. Although I do disagree with it, it doesn’t bother me to debate it on an intellectual level. It was distasteful because it was clear that the guy who wrote it was a real weirdo. Steve’s affect is creepy and, as we’ve seen the last few years, his character is fundamentally dishonest.So, when I say that Steve Sailer is a goofy, jock-sniffing dork, please don’t miss my subtler point. I’m not just hurling insults for rhetorical effect. I’m saying that that really is his caliber of humanity and that the idea which he is best known for, HBD, is basically just one long running sports commentary about the Black Team and the White Team.HBD is not science; it’s sabermetrics for spergs.

                I’d say that it’s more that Sailer identifies with the Cloud People. He’s always considered himself part of the punditry class, albeit as the one who’s name shall never be mentioned.Those are “his” people. He’s an intellectual snob and absolutely doesn’t want to be associated with the Dirt People, which is which he hates Trump, went all-in on Covid and loves Ukraine.Many in his audience thought that because he recognized racial differences that he might be sympathetic to whites. That’s not the case. He’s sympathetic to his beloved colorblind civic nationalism and, correctly, views the anti-white agenda bad for his cause.Sailer isn’t pro-white; he’s anti-anti-white. That a guy who understands HBD can have no feelings for his own people is very bizarre.

                I became disillusioned with Sailer a couple years ago when he dismissed the idea of a secession or separation out of hand.  It’s not necessarily that he  had to support it,  it was not worth discussing.

            Just for fun, I offer a conspiracy theory, only because it is amusing:The elites now want Trump to win because the democrats have proven unreliable in their defense of Israel and Trump will allow Israel to genocide the people of Gaza.  Further, the elites sense that they have pushed too much anti-whiteness too fast, and are at risk of triggering more opposition than they would like to face.A Trump win would give the traditional whites a false sense of victory so that they will relax a bit, which will allow the elites to continue to slowly tighten the noose as older whites die off.Even if it is a shrewd plan, many of the elites have a hatred of Trump that precludes executing this plan.  However, it wouldn’t surprise me if many top neocons are entertaining such thoughts.

                    Haley can’t beat Trump. The entire premise of the “Republican Primary” is they need someone who finishes a strong second so when the system takes Trump off their hands, they can say with a straight face, “Oh, too bad, here’s Nikki who more people wanted than Chris Christie”.Whether a “war with China” candidate like Haley can beat Newsom is unlikely, but from the donor perspective, either one would be just perfect.

            Before you write Sailer’s analysis off as crazy consider that a lot of people, myself included, just went, overnight, from being lukewarm about Trump to being totally determined to write him in regardless of whether he’s officially on the ballot. This isn’t love of Trump, it’s pure spite.In fact, I can see the Colorado GOP being confronted with a massive Trump write-in victory. Then what do they do? In fact, this whole scheme to remove Trump from the ballots could easily end up with him winning the general election as a write-in. This is the kind of thing that could end up with the much feared and anticipated “constitutional crisis”.It’s exactly this kind of nonsense that could easily kick off CW 2.0 and that is often a source of the instability that people talk about as a characteristic of third world regimes.Sailer may be right that it’s a 3D chess move but I suspect that the move is more in the direction of just what I’m talking about. The Colorado court may be setting the stage deliberately for the breakup of the country or a constitutional crisis leading to a call for a constitutional convention – which amounts to calling for the country to be broken up, basically.

                Elections in Colorado are completely rigged, and have been since 2012 when the state passed the deadly combination of automatic “motor voter” registration at the DMV and universal mail-in ballots. Colorado went from hard red in the 1990s to purple in the 2000s, and then immediately turned deep blue after 2012.Tens of thousands of migrants have been shipped to Denver in the past few months. Every single one of them will be automatically registered to vote at the DMV when they apply for a driver license or Colorado ID unless they affirmatively opt out, which almost nobody does. A ballot will be mailed to them at the address the give the DMV. The Democratic Party’s ballot harvesting operation takes the reins from there.Colorado’s Republican party fully supported these laws. They were too stupid to understand what the Democrats were going to do with them. Now the Republican party is completely irrelevant in Colorado.

        I am amused when I read people saying that dissolution ain’t happening. But when they end up wiping their collective asses on the worthless green backs that are coming, and they can’t get the part to fix their furnace or car that they are still paying for, much less paying any bill, then we shall see. This country will not go quietly to the ash heap of history like the Sovuet Union did. I suspect it will go out with a bang, right down to that Democrat neighbor you always knew was type who would inform on you.

        We can talk about national divorce all we like, but as long as women have rights and can vote in the successor state, none of this will matter and it will keep happening again.

            Women now expect to vote their say. Unless SHTF _hard_, I doubt they will relinquish the vote. If we attempt to impose on them, they will almost certainly, collectively refuse to give us babies. Some of us may not wake up in the morning if he rapes his woman. The ranges where I shoot often are filled with more women and their daughters than men.
But long term I believe you are correct. After a virtuous phase, women would regress to where we are now. Leopards changing their spots and all.

                    It is the case.  Lord knows, I have pleaded with, shamed, educated, cajoled and threatened men over the past three decades about their sorrowful simpery and cuckdom.They’d rather all of heaven rage and roil, and all of Western Civilization expire, than confront their wives, daughters, moms, and whatnot.There is a remnant recognizing that female empowerment = total ruination of all good things, but only a remnant.  The UC and UMC, the dads-with-daughters, the mainstream ‘Christians’ and ‘conservatives’ are intransigent about females.  To say nothing of Lefties. Taking power away from princess horrifies and enrages anglo-nation men.That’s what 1000 years of the Romantic Tradition in the West — and the intervention of some very satanic elements –produces.

                    I haven’t looked to see if there’s any backing anecdotes, but someone on Fedi said that’s how it goes: once women get a say in how a society is run it’s a one-way trip into the side of the canyon wall because they’ll only give up their power when there’s left to even “give up”.  Even as they’re toted off to some drug-lord’s rape dungeon they’ll exclaim “you’ll pay the next election!”

            The problem isn’t so much women as that literally everything is left up to a vote. There are plenty of stupid white men who vote leftie, too, and if you let them vote you into migrant amnesty, you will sooner or later get migrant amnesty. If you let them vote for women with penises, eventually, that’s what you will get.Until we figure out a way to, for example, limit the feds to Article I Section 8 powers, and ruthlessly destroy anything they’ve done since 1787 which does not fall within those limits, you are going to end up right back where we are.

                    At the end of the day, if we’re dead set on still doing democracy, the franchise must be radically curtailed. The specifics of how to do that aren’t terribly important insofar as there are numerous approaches that would produce a sensible and responsible electorate.

                        This is the way to go about it. There are basically ZERO other institutions that are run like modern liberal democracies. If you want to vote in the shareholder election you need to own the stock. A while ago I made the point that even all those oh-so-pozzed software wankers will not listen to your ideas about their open source project unless you contribute some code. Basically, skin-in-the-game is THE rule everywhere – except in voting in liberal democracy. Once we get people to see that this is the necessary root principle of WCN (whatever comes next) we can work on the specifics.My personal preference of course is no female suffrage except (perhaps) for purely local matters and then only for married women.

                    I upvoted because you are correct that it would result in a more conservative country. I just doubt it will be sufficient if we can’t somehow get it out of people’s heads that they have some right to vote whether other people have to eat the bugs.
There’s the oft mentioned quip, what have conservatives managed to conserve? Instead all we get are “The Conservative Case for…” articles.

        I’m not real big on the divorce metaphor since it implies that there once was love. AINO has always, even back in the early days, existed in a kind of detente, ameliorated by distance and wealth. With the advent first of television, and then the internet, the distance has lessened, to the point where people thousands of miles apart can become instantly outraged by the drug overdose death of some two bit hoodlum while in police custody. Psychologically, no distance at all. The wealth hasn’t diminished much, yet. My assessment is that GD 2.0 is not very far in the future, although people have lost money trying to predict such things. Taking the distance and the wealth out of the detente eliminates the detente, which doesn’t automatically lead to “divorce,” at least not immediately. It just leaves you with rival factions which no longer have reasons to coexist. My powers of prognostication are insufficient for what ensues thereafter.

        But the divorce occurring in 2024 really does hinge upon the actions of the SC, doesn’t it? And frankly, I don’t know which way it’s going to go. Yes, the court has its fair share of Leftist fanatics who view the law as merely an extension of the Power Structure’s agenda, but as a whole, it has also shown occasional signs of independence. If the SC does strike down banana republic behavior in places like Colorado, the Grillers will putter around the palace for several more years before finally schlepping off to that dingy flat across the railroad tracks.

            I agree. The most sensible, most “conservative” (in the sense of preserving the status quo) thing for the SC to do in smack Colorado down so hard those mountains will become lakes. In the spirit of “pour encourager les autres” this would probably stop all the other states from getting funny ideas too. The election could then be fortified as usual and Brandon or Brandon2 (the re-Brandoning) squeaks in with 81,000,000.5 votes. Do they have the sense and self-control to do this? I have no idea.

                We can be certain that some plan or another is afoot to keep Orange off the ballot in 2024. Frankly I’d be disappointed if this Colorado thing is part of that plan. Regardless, if or when the real plan has to get ruled on by the SCOTUS, they will not be pro Orange.
As for what the plan actually is, kind of like the plandemic, we should know it when we see it.

        It certainly seems that Z-Man is on a holy crusade and will not rest until he has convinced everyone that “the old America is dead.” This is tilting at windmills, though. I’m not sure who these masses are who think that the old America is still alive. I don’t know any such people, myself.The choice of the divorce metaphor provides a clue about this. The more you read of dissident writings, the more it emerges that the stereotypical member of this tribe is not so much an ex-normiecon but is actually a disillusionedhipster. They are the sort of person whose views perhaps never inclined very strongly to the Left, but who in their past would have embraced an attitude of libertarian hedonism and practical atheism and would have adapted America’s liberal credo in defense of those positions.As a result, their old habits of mind come through in their new dissidentism. They still have that hipster’s snarky arrogance, their materialistic outlook, and their readiness to depreciate anything not conformable to their urbane reason. Since they tend to scoff at appeals to anything other than “the science,” it is little wonder that their primary route, and principal attachment, to dissident politics comes via Darwinistic HBD; its evolutionary paradigm is suitable to their worldview. Indeed, they often cite racial politics as the source of their “red pill.”The fact that they ever took a red pill is what’s significant here; this is conflict that led to their “divorce” from their previous life, and it is from the bitterness of that separation whence comes their repeated need to reconquer themselves daily on the interwebs, reaffirm their red-pilled status, and to mirror upon the consciousness of all and sundry that the areso over that bitch,old America.Well, it’s not for me delve too deeply into the psychology behind all this at the present time, but it bears repeating that this all seems a little overblown to those of us who are not recovering hipsters but “real conservatives,” i.e. people with noble and aristocratic natures, the deeply religious, the true scholars, or (let us not forgot), the honest working men, the relics of the old peasantry. It’s a bit confusing to be constantly harangued with the insistence that the old America is gone when we never even knew her to begin with. It remains to us Traditionalists only to gently insist from time to time—while ducking your mad slashes—that maybe your Dulcinea del Toboso was never exactly the lovely lady you imagined her to be.

                I was disheartened to see how many (really, nearly all) of my acquaintances took the “Putin Man Bad” path in the Ukraine conflict because they still see armed conflict by GAE as enforcing the holy mission of the great and good.  I’m pretty well convinced that’s at least part of what Greg Johnson’s blathering on the subject is.  It doesn’t make any sense to us because they haven’t yet resigned themselves to the fact that they truly do live in the evil empire.

                        A bot would not make as many clerical errors as I do. My inability to proofread on the fly is, embarrassingly, all too human.
Furthermore, a bot would always stay scrupulously on-topic because—to anticipate the next question—programming a computer to achieve a convincing style of human imperfection is simply not possible.

                Hold on a second.I didn’t say anyone here is an idiot, and I do not believe that. The commenters here are obviously quite bright.And I don’t think that our host, Z-Man, is an idiot, He is clearly a high IQ individual. My specific criticism is that Z is a bit “deranged,” and I mean that not as an insult but as a clinical description. He has a tendency to see things backwards, i.e. to give a mental construction priority over a quiddity, or to confuse which things are constructions and which are quiddities. This is pretty evident in his inability—one might say his obstinate refusal—to understand what the word “morality” means. It’s not that he has an idiosyncratic idea of what is moral or immoral, it’s that he does not discern that morality simply cannot be defined as the result of consensus; that’s not included in the concept.Using stipulative definitions as an ace of trumps to win an argument does not move you any closer to the truth. It just means that you’re throwing a tantrum and demanding that world adopt your dictionary. The underlying nature of the concepts is not altered thereby. This is where the derangement comes in, because it requires some sort of delusion to believe that this accomplishes anything.

        This Trump ploy is not what meets the eye.https://rumble.com/v427job-breaking-colorado-supreme-court-bars-trump-from-ballot-dont-fall-for-the-ps.htmlIn short, the Co. Supreme Court simultaneously *stayed* their own decision until Jan 4, the day before the Co. election authorities have to settle who may be on their ballot.  The decision also says if Trump appeals to SCOTUS prior to Jan 4, the stay remains in place unless SCOTUS says otherwise. In other words, the decision has no effect on the state primary ballot if Trump appeals. (If he doesn’t appeal, presumably the stay lapses.) Assuming BOM appeals, an obvious given, why did the Co. Supreme Court do something that would have no effect? I suspect Vivafrei is correct: they want to provoke some MAGA guy somewhere to do something violent and oh so titillating to be broadcast by regime media, loudly and often. “See how Trumpists are really terrorists? Something must be done!”

            I think a more plausible take is it gives the USSC the option to bail and blame it on standing, which is all too common. Since the decision is stayed, no one has been harmed, so there is no justicible case of controversy.Refer back to suits challenging the courts and executives in the states who “rewrote” mail-in ballot laws. Before the election, they were all dismissed for lack of standing — they could point to exactly no one whose rights had been infringed, since the election had not happened. And afterwards, the cases were thrown out because the courts were not going to interfere in the “results” of the elections. And Thomas pointed out in a dissent that if they couldn’t bring the case before the election, and they couldn’t bring it after the election, when exactly could they?

                This seems more right to me.Knowing this decision was coming—it was set up a while back by that other Colorado ruling (not precedential/controlling but a rhetorical/signal ruling, for publicity and history) that Trump, though innocent of whatever the accusation was in that case, committed insurrection—the regime has been firing warning shots increasingly close to Thomas, symbol of pre-2020 law. The recently adopted SC “ethics rules” exist solely to remove him if he won’t recuse himself.As a practical matter the regime doesn’t need him gone. It’s already been demonstrated that on all matters electoral, he’s outvoted. But he has to be destroyed, his name made a curse—the first Justice ever removed—because he’s a normal person.It’s interesting that Colorado is being set up to be the hero state in the future history of deTrumpification. Their Secretary of State is a notable character in the recent evolution of Our Democracy. Her “Early Life” has been scrubbed.

            That’s on the right track. The performative anti-Trump lawfare is as ever more about signaling their bonafides than about fixing the system to any path. In Weimerica stray-voltage feints beat a frontal attack every time. It figures, this lot came up through elite schools and various corporate nurseries which exist to train them not to resolve anything while practicing full-spectrum manipulation of rivals. We are human shields.

        Just as the Negro’s demand access to the White mans labor, inventions, businesses, women, children and productivity since they are quite sure that they as a group could never duplicate our success, the left will always demand access to the political right (including the DR) for the same reasons. Everything they do fails, then they sit back and demand that we fix it, because no one wants to live in a shithole, right? Ayn Rand was correct in that there are people who are just naturally better than others. Not in the “loved by God sense” but in the universalist sense of talent and brains. Trouble is, there ain’t no Galt’s Gulch and there ain’t enough guts left in the American population to do anything about it.

        I always thought they would just jam Trump up in the usual ways, politically. This worked for them very well from 2016-2020.   I never thought they would be willing to shatter the illusion of “our democracy” with trumped up fake criminal charges and BS ballot lawfare attacks.  Who knows what’s next. But now that they are so openly corrupt and making no efforts to hide it, marshal law and fema camps are just no longer unthinkable.

            Yep. I really think that day arrived when the intelligence services and domestic federal law enforcement conducted a failed coup attempt and no one was charged let alone hanged. Maybe that was too subtle for normie? Regardless, they have moved to straight rule by force. That’s not a successful strategy long term but it will be godawful in the interim.

            What’s next is, at some point, an assassination attempt.The Regime has been yelling for years that they will not permit Trump to be president again. They’ve impeached him, twice, rigged one election against him, hurled lawsuits and criminal charges at him and run phony candidates against him. Nothing has yet worked. They’ll attempt to imprison him next, then continue attempting to disqualify him from ballets, and if &amp; when those approaches fail, they’ll call in the spooks in Langley.They’ve been telling us for years who they are. Take them at their word. They will not stop until Trump is in prison, or dead, and they don’t care which, just that he never set foot in the White House again.If they succeed, it will absolutely provoke something akin to a civil war, but the Regime doesn’t care. From their POV they have all instruments of state power on their side, and moral righteousness, so if they ultimately have to imprison or kill scores of anti-democratic heretics, that’s just the way it has to be.

                I.M.Agree with you.If Trump gets his block knocked off by Langley or one of their associates, then he will become a martyr and it might Jsut wake up enough Normies to join the rest of us in the DR.
It would be horrific, but if it led to a faster divorce in the medium term, then it will be worth it.Those of us who indeed take Leftists and the regime at their word, know that they don’t care how Orange Man is blocked from office, Jsut that he is.

The last generation of commie leaders weren’t willing to take up the Samson Option. The maniacs in DC are. They are the Bolsheviks of 1917, not those of 1989.

                Civil War II = An existing US state or group of states declare themselves sovereign and no longer subordinate to the US federal government and express a willingness to defend this sovereignty with force if necessary. They stop sending checks to the federal authorities. They strip all federal actors of authority within their territory.There is basically no chance of this happening in the foreseeable future.  They are never going to go from the status quo to this state of affairs overnight.  You would see many failed attempts at reform first before this was even thinkable.  All we’ve seen at this point is grumbling, mostly from the population and not the ruling elite in the various states.   We have not even seen an attempt to wrest back power in the Senate by the states.The most we have seen from any of the states is a willingness to disobey the feds’ drug laws by left wing progressive states like California. This has expanded recently to include some more conservative states.This idea that the latest outrage by the leftist powers that be will spark (a miracle) and then we’re at national divorce/civil war is just fantasy to avoid the hard work of defeating this evil system.The very same people who say this is going to happen will tell you the GOP is made of up traitors and cowards. But these are the very same people we would have to rely on for this kind of organized resistance.  The state leadership in most states simply are not with us. There are entire forests of weeds that would need ironing out.The other option is a “revolution” by the people who will overthrow their oppressors.  I think this has a better chance of happening in the next 5 years than the above scenario (but still very low), but a far worse outcome.  Any effort at “revolution” will result in a lot of dead people and a lot of people in prison, families ruined and poverty. It would look far more like BLM/Antifa riot than an actual revolution. It could be chaotic, but that’s about it. A mass of unorganized rabble-rousers are incapable of accomplishing anything but chaos.  I would definitely find this amusing to watch though.

                    They would first have to create their own currency/money, refuse acceptance of federal reserve notes as legal tender, and get some banks on board or  create new ones.  People will need to be able to earn a living and pay their bills.  As 90% + are wagies, and fed income tax is withheld a the source, you’d have to get employers on board to flip the middle finger to the feds and stop withholding.  For multi-state employers that is not likely to happen.

                        There is no way any of this is happening.  In fact, I’ll go so far to say that nothing is going to get any better or change for many generations – if ever at all.  The only way it happens is if they start putting taking people away for the way they vote, taking their money blatantly, not allowing them to work or watch football.  It has to be that severe.  Otherwise, fast forward 50 years, and the same type of people as us will be here having the same conversations we have now.

                        TC – I agree.  Highly unlikely it will happen that way.  More likely is the slow grind of disintegration of the centralized power and concomitant rise of local power centers.  You see fits and sputters of it with sanctuary city declarations for this or that pet issue. Once the centralized authority loses the ability to enforce its edicts, then divorce will happen.  But we are a long way from that.

        Trump is *not* off the Colorado ballot, and he is not going to be removed from there before the election. You can read the pertinent post at CTH to confirm. That doesn’t mean the anaconda is not coiling – it is –  as Zman so succinctly observes.
But the Lawfare headfake certainly has everyone repeating the lie, which no doubt was their goal. This time.
Continue to prepare for the biggest, most deadly solar storm you can imagine. It’s going to change the entire political landscape, for those that survive.

        Can’t believe how I didn’t realise all this before.
In every system, every work-place or institution, the buck stops with somebody. Even on committees, the buck will often stop with somebody with sufficient experience. I’ve no idea how courts work but the buck will stop with somebody there, too. Go high enough up the chain, and someone needs to make a decision.
And it’s very easy to make a decision based on prejudices; and Leftists have prejudices in abundance. So it seems natural that, when they infest every institution, we’ll get ‘Leftist results’.

                Exactly.
Sort of the reverse of the advice I got when, as an 18 year old, I entered the workforce proper:
“If you want to know where you’ll be in this company in 10 years time, look at a guy who’s been there for that long.”
I left a fair few jobs upon applying that maxim. Too many paths led to ‘management’!

        “They” don’t want a divorce.  That would suggest that maybe the wholesale slaughter of 2-3% of the US population during the Civil War was a ghastly mistake, and maybe the South had a point.
No, they want to keep the same outward forms of government to grant legitimacy, even if they have to import and distribute via rail, bus, and airplane 3 MILLION “new citizens” a year to do it.
It’s massive overkill.  20 states have less than 3 million citizens in their whole borders; small amounts would tip the scales forever.
But they’re going to do it anyway.

        I’ve always felt and continue to believe that 2020 was the inflection year. A decent chunk of whites – say ~10% or so – lost faith in the system. Covid, BLM and the election were enough to put them over the hump.Probably another 10% to 15% began to question the system. The regime tried to tone things down after 2020. (Anyone notice that BLM and Antifa disappeared.) But they’re so incompetent that flare ups kept occurring, like Afghanistan, Hunter Biden, the prosecution of the J6ers, weird Biden speeches, etc. Basically, it kept the pot simmering.Now you have the prosecution of Trump, which is getting that 10% to 15% to stop believing in the system. I hope that the regime throws Trump into jail. That would be the best thing for us.So, yes, many people are moving from thinking about divorce to what life after the divorce will be like.

            I still contest that they are trying to provoke a reaction.  They know the monetary system is kaput, they need an excuse to enact martial law and point the finger at anyone but themselves.  2020 was a financial crisis, they know their time is short, that is why it was ok to protest for a loser but not ok to protest for your rights.  That is why they are blatant, they were hoping J6 wouldn’t have to be so fake.  That real, honest people, would do their work for them.  I still think the best course of action is to do nothing for the time being.  They are so incompetent doing anything else would only help them.  Think of it as like a woman who no longer wants to be with you, but doesn’t want to sully her “good” reputation so she makes you so miserable you call it off.

            To the downvoters, why do you think the media is the way it is?  Why do you think Trump’s entire presidency was the way it was?  Why do you think he’s been more talked about during Bidens presidency then Biden?  They want you to throw the first punch, kinda like lincoln and Fort Sumpter.  Lotta people in the North were not down for war until he made them throw that first punch.  On a personal note, you’ve probably been thinking about this for, maybe six years at the most.  Prob since your hero trump was elected?  Some of us were way ahead of you with regards to thinking about this, but you still won’t submit to better minds.  Sigh.  In so many ways, many of you are no different then what you profess to hate.

                    Building our own communities is by far what the TBTB fear the most. It’s what they will fight against to the end because it really would mean the end for them.Their whole system relies on us having no back up, not base on which to fall back. Getting us fired doesn’t do much if we’re hired by a friendly company. Taking our bank doesn’t matter if a friendly bank gives us an account. Etc.And once a few communities get set up and withstand the media and legal storm, people will notice how much better they are and what a sense pride members of those communities feel. That’s game over for the regime – and they know it.

                    I agree with you, except for the portion with regards to sitting around and doing nothing.  What are you going to do?  Who would you even strike?  Power and control have been removed so far from your local community who would you even address your grievances to?  That is why you’re here now.  Here is an experiment for you to try:  Take the topics you talk about on the internet and talk about them with normies, at the bar or somewhere in your local area.  What do you think the reaction would be?Humanity is a herd animal, they won’t do anything until its popular.

                Well, there are two ways to look at it:
1. your way, that they are waiting for someone to make a move that justifies their crackdown, so don’t play the game.
2, they will manufacture a move, blame you for it, and crackdown anyway, so might as well do something (might as well do the crime if you’re going to do the time).

Having experienced the business end of the divorce-industrial complex, I viscerally related to that comment about believing you can patch things up, not because that’s likely but because the alternative seems so horrible. I know a lot of Normie’s who are in that very state, and I don’t think they have it in them to go through the process to a subsequent, better existence.

            Well as we know, the opposite of love is not hate, the opposite of love is indifference, when the other party no longer evokes any strong emotional response in you. The fact that your ex still tries to screw money out of you or tries to manipulate or influence your responses indicates that they haven’t really moved on, they just want revenge for some perceived slight. They want you to suffer.

        Somewhat tangential, but here’s one of the most interesting analyses I’ve seen of political power and how it changes hand. It claims to explain every kind of political power, from democratic governments, dictatorships and business environments. The theory has the distinction of being extremely simple and not relying on abstractions to argue its case.
Since it’s a universal theory, it’s never really on topic on any given subject, but almost always relevant. I’d love to hear what the Z-panel thinks of it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs

He usually blathers on about trivial matters like the superiority of hexagons, what makes a good flag, or the origin of the name Tiffany. But in this vid he superbly channeled Machiavelli’sThe Prince.It’s as good an explanation as any why Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a key statistic of comparative geopolitical analysis.

            I’ve watched that a couple times over the years and after mulling it over for a bit the economy of GAE really is closer to some tyrannical resource-based economy, only their resource is printing money (seigniorage as Z says).  This clears up some questions perhaps as the economic activity of GAE subjects has little bearing on the wealth generated for the empire

You do a fantastic job of expressing the ideas of our side in a way that is clear regardless of the intelligence of the reader, and doesn’t set of the “weirdo” alarm for normies. I can send your essays to people teetering on the brink without concern, which I can’t say about some other people I read.

        To reiterate, as long as stomachs are full and houses are warm, people will accept almost anything. The GAE collapses like a house of cards when neither of those things remain true. Much of the totalitarian impulse driving the latest round of political oppression is in anticipation of when bellies growl and hovels are cold. The crackdown will not work when that day comes, whenever that may be, but there is little else the Regime can do. Wars and terror attacks are now seen widely as fraudulent grifts and the rubes are far more hesitant to rally ’round Ol’ (rainbow) Glory; many would like to set it ablaze even now in their fat, 72-degree comfort.All old news, as they say, but two questions have grown more important since the Regime has announced its intention to disenfranchise half the country outright.The first question is why the United States continues with the fig leaf of elections even as they grow more transparently fraudulent. The best guess is it is mostly for foreign consumption with a lesser eye toward keeping the last of the True Believers onboard (this is why the Soviets, Saddam, or whoever held similar types of elections–keeping the form somehow made their similar conceptions of democracy real). The low IQ affirmative action hires and deranged women who comprise the Apparat love to lecture the world unironically about “our democracy.” It gives them tingles similar to Covidianism and mean tweets.The second and more important question is whether this can end peacefully even before the onset of widespread poverty. I think it can but only if the Left files for divorce first and leaves. This only can happen if it doesn’t get its way and it sees no path forward to do so. The 2020 election was stolen, after all, not because of fears about conservatards and normie but because the Apparat correctly realized the unhinged Left would blow up if that ol’ debbil Trump remained in office. The trick is to get around the Apparat and figure out how to make the Left stomp off so a peaceful separation becomes possible. Sure, the Left would continue to attempt to subvert and conquer like a deranged ex but over time that impulse would lessen. How to bring about such leftwing despair, though? I have no clue. I truly hope someone does.In the meantime, enjoy the show and tip your clowns and jugglers. And be sure to get one of those “I VOTED” stickers.

            The problem with this idea is that the Left you describe are the useful idiots of The Regime. On the one hand, the coasts of our nation are massive, extremely rich geographically and open to the world’s two major oceans. Still, the interior of the country does contain vast wealth. The Regime is not going to relinquish this territory. Now, there could be tremendous value in forcing The Regime to exercise hard power on yet another of its foot soldier constituencies. They are already doing so on their indoctrination center administrators. If the wine moms did whine hard enough for national divorce, The Regime would have to further unmask itself within its own ranks.From that perspective, the perspective of legitimacy, if the Whine Moms moved beyond whining and mobilized petitions and movements for a real secession, things could get very interesting.I like this kind of discussion. I think The Regime is very susceptible to psy-ops and of course its revolutionary rhetoric and hi-low coalition is extremely unstable. If you could find a way to meme this faction into a real action that threatened the right people who will never let go of a substantial portion of this continent things could get interesting.

                That’s a very valid criticism and also a great idea about the memes. I think the Regime has decided, whether it is correct or not, that it could not stop a Left exodus. The only alternative explanation, it would seem, is along the lines of what you suggested–the Regime could hold onto its leftist useful idiots but only at a tremendous cost.“You will celebrate diversity and fly the Confederate flag over your trans pet cemetery” is the type of meme that springs to mind, but how to make that sort of thing not across as a light parody from a rightwing perspective would be tough.

            When we see conservative whites stop standing for the national anthem, we’ll know we’re really getting somewhere.

                I think GD II ends it all, period. I’m thinking of how it might come apart before then. As for sitting out the national anthem, when whites started to opt out of the military was a step down that road.

                Then we’ve got a ways to go. As part of one of my jobs, I regularly attend local college sportsball games, and naturally, a high percentage of attendees are Grillers. I haven’t seen a one refuse to stand for the anthem. At most, fewer are placing hand over heart and gazing at yon Stars and Stripes with lachrymose adoration. I guess that’s a start…

                        No doubt about it. Refusing to demonstrate fealty to AINO would be seen as typical Leftist anti-Americanism rather than rightwing dissidence. And, at bear minimum, you’d receive beaucoup dirty looks, perhaps even some vituperation. Most people don’t want to deal with that.

                        My girlfriend, who is just about transformed from normiecon to DR (we first met as government immigration lawyers in 2002), and I were talking about this the other day.  She’s not a sportsball person and came up with I think the best response to the whole Kaepernick thing-“not my circus, not my problem”.  I never got too upset about it beyond always finding Kaepernick loathsome.  Sit or stand is an interesting question that I’ve been thinking about-not that I see any sportsball attendance in our near future.

            ‘The best guess is it is mostly for foreign consumption’
This is why, correct.  To maintain the illusion of Good America that, gasp, would never rig an election!
The net is global, yes, but average folks in most other nations consume mainstream U.S. news, i.e. pure propaganda.  It’s easier to access and ubiquitous.  Certainly, that is the case in my ‘third world’ country.  Most of ’em don’t have the time or interest to dig.

            “The 2020 election was stolen, after all, not because of fears about conservatards and normie but because the Apparat correctly realized the unhinged Left would blow up if that ol’ debbil Trump remained in office. The trick is to get around the Apparat and figure out how to make the Left stomp off so a peaceful separation becomes possible.”Excellent Post, Jack.  This statement I highlighted above is exactly why I wanted a Trump win in 2020.  Not because I thought anything could be done to fix this strip mall, but only because I knew it would accelerate the collapse and the left would go berserk.  Cities would burn, chaos would ensue, and it is exactly (unfortunately) what is needed to finally have it out.  There is no political solution and there is no compromise or reasoning to be had.  The only solution is the final solution.

                This is a great post and thread for me too.  2020 was indeed the watershed year, the hat trick of Convid, Floyd riots and election fraud did it for me (plus my mom died right before Convid thank God).  I’m well into acceptance and it’s wonderful.  BF is coming along nicely-all the AINO flags are gone and he’s moving quickly into acceptance.  We saw “Maestro” yesterday, another depiction of what America once produced and was.  During one of the magnificent Bernstein symphony sequences, a guy (may have been Israeli) had his phone open-just a reminder of where things are now.

            Its all been dead to me since 2008.  Our system is based on “discovering price”.  If they are willing to lie about price, which is what they do when they QE and 0% rates for a decade, what aren’t they willing to lie about?

                Quite right, Mr. House.
The old 2008 financial balls-up seems to be a distant memory now… but real and bad things happened because of it. At scale.
Then people just seemed to ‘forget’. But it felt to me at the time (even though I still voted and was in no-way enlightened) that something profoundly Evil had happened. And that the fix seemed to be more Evil, but done in an obfuscated way (i.e., more covert money-meddling).

            Where am I? I accepted that it wasn’t my country over ten years ago and have been putting my efforts into building a parallel system with the end goal of a new country…As more Whites wake up to the fact that they live in a system that hates them and wants them dead then more will come to the realization that if they want to secure their future and that of their children’s they will have to sacrifice for it…

        I haven’t heard much of anything from a “cheaper to keep her” faction who prefer to just go on as things are, grumbling about the burning bed but reluctant to part ways, knowing how ugly a parting would be. I’ve seen more than a few such real-life unions in my time, generally among the older generations for whom divorce was still culturally taboo. Neither party is happy, but neither are they in hot conflict in their uneasy truce.I don’t suppose anyone seriously thinks we can kiss and make up, left and right, liberal and conservative, BIPOC and White. Too much mud has been slung, low blows dealt, darts thrown to set aside our vast differences, no matter how unpleasant is the possibility of national divorce.If it must come, so be it. But I wish it would just get here, already. I’m not getting any younger, and the suspense is killing me.

            “I’ve seen more than a few such real-life unions in my time, generally among the older generations for whom divorce was still culturally taboo.”So very true. My paternal grandparents–both born ca. 1900–were locked into a highly unpleasant marriage, but for people of their generation divorce was unthinkable. So, rather than break the taboo, grandpa laid down on his bed one afternoon in early January of 1976, took his pistol and availed himself of the 45 caliber escape clause. I wonder if many Grillers, rather than turn traitor against the nation that betrayed them, will instead seek refuge in the afterlife.

        Two secession posts in a row! Uncharacteristic. I think Zman underestimates how much normal people disliked the J6 riot. It was embarrassing to be a Trump voter when that happened, and I think most people see the “political prisoners” as lawbreakers who got harsh but predictable treatment.

What a mundane argument you present. Women with kids in grade school do OnlyFans for extra cash, and people with engineering jobs commit crimes, have horrible characters, and beat their kids in grade school when they find out their wife is doing OnlyFans.
What about people call pants “slacks?” Or who park in handicapped spaces without a tag? Or older people who were lefthanded by nature, but forced by nuns to write with their right hand? People who travel to natural parks — what are their thoughts?

                    Wrong. Some of us actually watched the released video. You apparently only watch the 6 minute loop played consistently by CNN. A great majority of the indicted people did noting but walk around escorted by the Capital Police. The only fatality caused by the event was a well dressed, white veteran female named Ashley Babbitt who was murdered in cold blood, ON VIDEO, by a cowardly ni**er who then went on TV bragging about his heroism.

                        I was under the impression that the sheer hysteria (i.e., calling the thing ‘The Insurrection’) was something that most Normal individuals might realise was simply too much. I mean, I’m an Englishman, and I knew very little about the event. But given past knowledge of Leftist infiltration, it was clear that the ‘Insurrection’ was a big put-on.In this way, it perhaps could have brought many more whites over this way. Then again, they’d need to suspect something was up in the first instance.Perhaps your experiences are different? Surely, the farce of the thing must have prodded some whites to think a little bit harder?

                Probably not worth the bytes to respond, but if you believe the J6ers behaved like BLM, there is no hope for you.  If only they did, Biden would be in prison or J6 feet under.

                Frank,Most of the people who were at the J6 protest were normal people who knew the election was stolen and were trying to save the country.    Most of us on this side knew they were ill advised to go there and most of us knew they were going to be set up.    That does not negate their right to protest.
The majority of the destructive people there were obviously operatives for the government or BLM/Antifa or were LEOs themselves.  That is quite obvious now.

                    I agree they had a right to protest, and I think most of them were good-hearted people. I’m not sold on the whole thing being a set-up, but I’m open to being shown otherwise.
The main thing I want to get across is that, outside of our websites and podcasts, the J6 riot is not viewed very sympathetically. I think we should be realistic about the level of acceptance our viewpoints have in the wider world.

                The J6 goofballs did dumb stuff. This was not a win.
Then the Regime got a case of paranoid hysteria about it and went after the dummies with an all-out-of-proportion savage disregard of the principles of constitutional law and due process. That response was clear evidence that our government operates like a thinly-disguised dictatorship.
I wouldn’t call it a win, but a lot of chumps were smartened up, and that’s not nothing.

            Frank, I’m surprised at how harshly your post was received.  I’ll add a bit of anecdotal support to you by noting that immediately after Jan 6, my Trump loving brother was desperate for an explanation that did not include insurrection.He first grasped onto reports that the people who were violent were “far right” infiltrators.  (My response:  “Hey!  Those are my friends you’re talking about!”)Later, as the evidence of a massive FBI presence emerged, he settled on that.In any case, many conservatives are entirely unwilling to be associated with those who raise the black flag of rebellion.  They strongly, strongly disavow.

                Sup dude! You’re always on here! I can see why people like parts of J6. I personally really liked seeing all the “peaceful protest” supporters in Congress hiding under their chairs, certain the end was near. That was very funny. I just think it did more harm to the brand than people are willing to admit. Our views aren’t mainstream and we should be realistic about that.

                As I have mentioned here before, I have a cousin in academia who falls into that camp, what Z has labeled the “Gracious losers”.To him, anything that is not genteel must be recoiled from and exiled immediately! Try to explain to him how his preferred course of action has gotten us nowhere and that a change of game plan is in order and he’ll howl with protest! He’s also the type of person who’ll trot out the term “expert” at the drop of a dime. When I have the audacity to mention to him the fact that a majority of these “experts” really don’t know warm shit from peanut butter and in fact are the reason why we have so many problems these days and that they are the cause of most of them, well, his reaction is akin to taking a vampire and throwing it out into the sunlight.Nothing gets his indignity up more than the impugning of anyone from his class.

            What I remember of the Jan 6 fiasco was the infiltration of government agents in the crowd, the scenes of the Capitol guards on the other side of the building waving the people in, the abject passivity of those inside strolling about (exception noted with Ashli Babbitt), and the treatment of those arrested in the incident, which was vindictive if not plainly unconstitutional.That there is a large segment of the populous that is still in thrall to the MSM/Leftist narrative only means that there are stupid, gullible, and non-thinking people in this country in large numbers.  It does not mean that *this* Trump voter is embarrassed.  Indeed, I’ve yet to meet one of those (embarrassed) Trump supporters you think are in abundance.  Rather the Jan 6 fiasco has simply confirmed why we voted for Trump.

            At least 20 major cities would have burned to the ground if, instead of “the counting of votes” stopped at 12 am in 6 states only to suddenly discover that Biden actually won every single one of those states they just counted them like normal times and Trump won.
Democrats were quite open about it.
That’s called a “color Revolution.”  Locked, cocked, and ready to roll.  It’s not “organic”, either.

            You need to read what @Frank wrote, not what you think he wrote.People can only run with the facts they have. They’ve been told so many times that J6 was a “riot” or an “insurrection” that they’ve come to accept it. Saw it in my own family. (Not my wife and kids. If anything, they are more “based” than I am. I’m talking my siblings and my dad.)You do realize that’s why it was so important to clamp down on people whose videos and Tweets were making the point that J6 was all a nothingburger or even that maybe they had a point — the election really was stolen.

            “I think Zman underestimates how much normal people disliked the J6 riot.”
Of course they did not like it. In much the same way that Normal people would not vote for the BNP. They’re normal. In The System fully. They have zero capacity to recognise Evil, on the whole; and frankly, many don’t wish to do so.
Normality, niceness or whatever won’t save a man’s soul.

                Yeah, I agree that most people want to be in the moral consensus and don’t think too much about it.
So what we want is a society of nice, normal people who see our moral claims as the consensus view. I think J6 took us further away from that, not closer.

            It’s because conservatism is a state of mind. It’s why MAGA took to the courts after witnessing all the shenanigans surrounding the 2020 presidential election. It’s why Trump and his supporters (who constitute the overwhelming majority of the Republican base), after calling the 2020 results fraudulent, are earnestly contesting the 2024 election. And, yes, it’s why some of them (along with Frank, apparently) are skulking around under the pogroms following the mostly peaceful January 6 “insurrection”. The conservative mind is predisposed to a belief in the system, thinking that it (rather than the system) screwed up. Meanwhile, conservatism’s opponents are using that system to unleash a reign of terror upon us, because that is just how they are disposed to behave.

                My acceptance of the end of the republic also came with my acceptance that most conservatives have unchangeable behavioral proclivities that will ensure they loose.
Conservatives are psychologically unfit to rule, and deserve to be a low-status servant population obeying the commands of their betters.

                    True enough in the present West. But it’s important to note that in historic terms conservatism has been the default position of the ruling classes. Witness the inability of France’s Ancien Régime to resolve its fiscal imbalances. Our modern crises arise, not from conservatism, but rather out of the liberal drive for gratuitous “reform”. It’s more akin the the ancient Mayans’ human sacrifice to stave off the end of the earth, a practice that once the Spanish put a stop to proved to be wholly unnecessary. Our rulers also seek to justify (if not preserve) their status through dysgenic actions in response to “crises” of their own manufacture. The failure of conservatism is therefore not so much one of support for the establishment as it is its inability to fully grasp the utter foolishness of our leaders.

            J6 was barely a riot, except in the minds of the usual suspects. Sure, some disorderly conduct but no comparison to the “mostly peaceful protests” (ie hyperviolent arson sprees) of the  summer previous. Most “normal” people are puzzled by why it was made into such a big deal. Not to mention the nagging question of who actually instigated the illegal acts. If you seriously believe J was an insurrection, you are living on Planet MSM.

            The only mistake made by the J6ers (albeit a big one) was they didn’t finish the job properly.  If you’re going to do it, do it all the way.  The only people who should have walked out of that building were J6ers.  No one else…

        What’s occurring in the USA seems to be very similar to what used to occur in “elections” in US controlled banana republics like Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador: real candidates would either be forced out one way or another (legal, or imprisonment, or defamation, or intimidation) or just assassinated. What goes around comes around. Third world USA.

                The shenanigans of the current regime could probably not have worked, or at least would have been much more difficult, in the USA of yore, which was ethnically and culturally much more homogeneous. But in a country where whites will become a minority by 2050, and which is flooded with immigrants from other places who have no idea of self-government and rights, and who hail from places that are often despotisms, it’s easier to get away with all this. The end result of all this will be a Somoza, Batista, or Duvalier.

                    I do believe the City of London and the UK aristocracy exert disproportionate influence over US affairs, far more influence than our voters do. The role of wealthy Jewish families and literal Mafioso both inside N. America and abroad is substantial, too. We haven’t determined our choices in generations. Personally, I now have greater appreciation for how the aboriginal tribes must have felt while being colonized.

            Nicaragua seems the most analogous. It retained some indicia of liberal democracy but would from time to time squelch even that. For example, the wife of one of the revolutionaries, Violetta Chamorro, would publish the main newspaper LA PRENSA in opposition to the police state, and the Sandinistas would close it down and then let it open again. The one foot in, one foot out act is much the approach in today’s America.

        America’sLiberal Democracyis directly analogous to Iran’sIslamic Republic
In both systems the first word is the defining one, providing the paradigm within which second word operates. For us, that means that democracy is fine as long as it validates and advances liberalism. And completely illegitimate where it counters liberalism.
The banning of Trump by our regime’s clerisy will make that point obvious to all but the willfully obtuse.  Which unfortunately is a large fraction of normie YTs.

        Hitler IS under the bed. When he rose to power the first thing he did was drag out judges like those in Colorado – and make them disappear. The system pukes screamed bloody murder but the dirt people cheered or shrugged. If Trump goes down…the next guy that comes along is only going to be meaner and tougher.There sometimes comes a point where relationships get so bad that the courts and cops and restraining orders don’t work anymore and all there is left…is vengeance. Every second shit-poast on Blab is about how “they hate you and want to kill you…”As an angry, bitter and twisted stubfart those statements are becoming less chit poasts and more a statement of fact. This old Saxon is really, really hateful now too. Our ancestors used to kill people for doing stuff just like this.The system is going to hang itself, or We The People are. These are the kinds of straws that break the camel’s back….

            In the mid-nineties, the Democrats used Colorado as one of its leading fear mongering tokens. Colorado was a part of the bible belt. In fact, the same is true of Oregon. Colorado and Oregon seemed like stalwarts.Colorado was knocked out by tech industry migration. Sun, Cisco, DOD … … opened labs out there and California came in and turned it. These techno-elite whites were the arrowhead. Now the migration waves have finished it off.Oregon was taken down by retiring hippies who moved to Eugene and Portland. Being the home of Nike was a terrible thing as well. A managerial elite that is getting fat on outsourcing to China is a dooming factor. Now, rural Oregon, is being colonized by waves of cloud adjacent people moving in for lower cost of living. Along with it comes Yeowgahh stewdioahs aaaand infinity stripe except white flags and now a Star Wars bar of migrants from all over Africa and the Middle East.In the end, it was the white yuppie who destroyed this country. It was the Gomer Pyle Youngkin type who absolutely sold this country out. It isn’t just the politician. The worst offender was the army of termites who flowed from the colleges into the corporations in the 70s, 80s and 90s who are just rootless, cultureless consumers who confused resentment and status signaling with moral virtue.I am making my way through the western canon masterworks right now. Last night my read brought me through the passage where Aeneas is in the underworld looking for his father to affirm his mission for the Trojan diaspora. Sibyl is describing the scenes and attendant crimes in the Kingdon of The Dead. In one he says:“Here’s one that bartered his native land for gold, he saddled her with a tyrant, set up laws for a bribe, for a bribe he struck them down.”Bush; Youngkin; Clinton; Eric Schmidt; Gates; Cook;And of course we have the army of aliens who held power here now: Brin; Page; Pichai; the IBM guy; Knight; Nadella; Yang; the pantheon of Goldman Sachs CEOs; Fink;I think the Aeneid is fitting. It is a Frankenstein’s baby between Hispania and Troy that is our situation. Acquire roots in the heartland and do the hard work to cultivate our identity and prepare for a cross-generational project to erect our new Imperium. The rest is just a clown show that must be monitored only for practical purposes, not in pretending that we are going to do something to flip the script.

                While tech sector immigration and Hispanic immigration into Colorado certainly made a difference, it was the deadly combination of automatic “motor voter” registration at the DMV and universal mail-in voting enacted in 2012 that turned the state deep blue. Colorado’s elections have been rigged ever since. See my comment above for more detail.
I knew some of the power players in the Republican party in Colorado at the time. A few were whispered as Presidential contenders. They mostly supported these laws, too stupid to understand what the Democrats were going to do with them.

            When I first came into the dissident scene, 2015 or so, this question was often asked. The old hands said yes, IF: 1) we have 2 sets of elites, and 2) we have the military, or parts of the military, on either side.None of these things are true. At the moment.There seems to be a New Right elite forming up in the fringes…people who aren’t exactly /our guys/ like Peter Thiel, Elon, Tucker, Yoram Hazony, Michael Anton, the so-called IDW guys, and people who overlap such as Joe Rogan centrists. There are also a few New Rightish politicians, again not exactly /our guys/, like Matt Gaetz and JD Vance. Even though they don’t say the things us dissidents want to, they are saying things that were not uttered in public even a few years ago. So I’m hoping that we are at least getting a nascent elite, a true opposition to the uniparty.Next is our new elite capturing parts of the military. But that will be the hardest part.

                    MacGregor can be a little…blunt.  I mean, some of the stuff I’ll see him do I’ll think “you can dial back a notch and still make your point”, although, it probably is a pointless endeavor anyway.

What is missing are the thousands of people who take what he’s saying and sell it to the people around them, and only then give them links to McGregor.
The uncomfortable truth is if you are spending most of your time just hanging out in the DR echo chamber, while it is nice to know you are not alone, you aren’t helping solve the problem. I’m not pointing to anyone in particular. You know whether or not you are part of the solution.

                An important player in that group is Palmer Luckey of Andruil. Luckey invented the Occulus and sold it to Facebook. At Facebook he spoke out against The Religious Purge and was purged.Unfortunately, all of these guys are dependent on the government for money and Theil and his partner at Panopticon errr I mean Palantir are the villains who created the worlds seen in Neal Stephenson novels.It is a bad setup. These guys have zero ideological alignment with us. They have every economic incentive to align in some way with The Regime. If they usurp/supplant it, how much different will it be from the one we currently have. I suppose the common ground would be the wholesale deportation of the human detritis flooding over our land border and being air dropped in through the Clinton/Bush/Obama Triumvirate.There is no alignment with them on the importation of a new elite. They want engineers and scientists and their libertarian ideology means they are fully aligned with letting other countries invest in cognitive capital and just importing it rather than doing the hard work of investing in developing it here.That leads me to the point that, and I am sorry for it, I keep making almost daily now. Our important tasks are: procure land in the heartland and/or take over small heartland municipalities; develop an education system for our folk’s youth that skirts freedom of association restrictions and provides for a deep immersion in our culture and a positive identity as well as nurturing masculine traits in both our boys and girls.The images at the border, in our airports and on our city streets of how many and whom is invading us are startling.They really do hate us. We must channel our justified hatred of them into a cross-generational resolve to emerge as masters of a new Imperium. We have been fully sold out. The Republicans are snakes in the grass and they are far worse than the Democrats. Youngkin is the prototype of the traitor who brought us to this point. It would be perfectly fitting if he were appointed to lose. He’ll jettison Nimarata and bring along his little Winnie Sears for the ride just like he did in Virginia.

                        Thanks for calling that out Marko. You are right. Not only that, but we have to create as best we can good local conditions. From that base we get Luckey/Theil types at the national level (or is it the North American Mall level). We dig and claw and work to cultivate a strong identity and subsequent generations maneuver and capitalize on opportunities to hopefully something better.If whoever the counter elite is will deal with the anarcho tyranny and undertake the task of sending the armies of vagrants back home, that is a huge win.Anyway, that is a good call out and I appreciate having some dirt on my jeans now.

The “Right” (strictly for rhetorical convenience) could be talked into accepting a dramatically lower standard of living, if it meant being left alone. Given what we’ve already experienced, inflation-wise, it probably wouldn’t even be that hard a sell.Alas, the Left (again for rhetorical convenience) cannot accept that. They are the Righteous, and they won’t — can’t!– rest until the world is fully purged of iniquity. Plus there’s the fact that 99% of Leftists would starve if they had to shift for themselves. They will never, ever leave us alone, until they areforcedto leave us alone.

            If by “left” you mean college girls, shrieking street weirdos, MSM journos, late-night comedians, and most of the Democrat party, then I think itcanbe peaceful. That old pendulum need to keep swinging right – which it is, slowly and steadily – and pretty soon, most everyone will have a great laugh at all those leftists getting their comeuppance and being dragged into our glorious Muskite future while impotently rageposting on Mastodon.Nobody likes those uptight whiners. They peaked in 2020 and will not be coming back, and both white leftists and J*ws are not having babies, rather adopting pets. We are going to get a right-wing Latino or Hindu renaissance, with some rural whites thrown in there.Yes I’m being sanguine. It’s Christmastime…peace and good will towards men!

            It can be peaceful but only if the Left files for divorce first and leaves. The 2020 election was stolen because the Apparat realized that while normies and conservatards would put up with most anything, the estrogen-drenched Left would hike if Trump remained in office. I have no clue how to bring about the despair necessary to get the Left to leave, mind you, but that’s how to bring about a relatively bloodless divorce.

            What are they going to use them on?  Nukes are for high value strategic targets. As I read in the BMR, they have a mission statement of “continental depopulation”.  So are they going to hit their own cities?  Maybe they’ll burn Branson Missouri off the map since it’s the most concentrated area in all of Redneckistan?Ask president Kennedy why he stays up late worrying about nukes.

                Yes currently red-staters are dispersed geographically, so nukes would not be all that effective against us. If and when the National Divorce occurs, at some point “RedStateistan” will have to split off as a territory, whether it be the Pacific Northwest, Texas and OK, or somewhere else.
Once that happens, the DC’ers will nuke us.

                    Except most of the missile silos and air bases with nukes are in red states. Some of the sub bases are in fairly blue areas.
In a sane divorce, it might be possible to divide the arsenal along those lines.
Otherwise, it will be a struggle to take local, physical control as well as circumvent/interrupt any signals sent from Prog central.

                The problem with using nukes in or as a result of the “divorce” is as you say – where would they use them?  Right now, the geography of the parties is within blast radius of each other.  More than that, you can’t nuke one area even if out of the blast radius because the other area depends on it.  To follow the divorce analogy – it’s not that we moved from the house into an apartment, but we’ve just gone to separate bedrooms.

                    Efficiency and progress is ours once moreNow that we have the neutron bombIt’s nice and quick and clean and gets things doneAway with excess enemyBut no less value to propertyNo sense in war but perfect sense at homeThe sun beams down on a brand new dayNo more welfare tax to payUnsightly slums gone up in flashing lightJobless millions whisked awayAt last we have more room to playAll systems go to kill the poor tonightGonna kill, kill, kill, kill, kill the poorKill, kill, kill, kill, kill the poorKill, kill, kill, kill, kill the poor tonightIn today’s Clown World regime’s war plans, for “the poor,” substitute “the Dirt People.”

        The way our enemies coordinated use of the word’Democracy’ is utilized is something to behold. Not used as a term or description, rather as a hypnotic trigger word as the queen card was used in the Manchurian Candidate. To implement the programmed response that normie has been trained for.Interesting to watch them constantly do it but it’s effectiveness has whittled down to just the low percentage of robots on their side. Of course the standard bearer Democratic operative and follower doesn’t care how it’s done , just get it done.I can’t wait for the fun and frivolity to come in the next year.
