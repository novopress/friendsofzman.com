        To make matters worse, the managerial class is heavily populated with members of protected groups. Trump will need to accept greater black unemployment as just one example. Since disparate impact is a sin, he will also be blocked by courts.
There will also be a lot of cat ladies shrieking about not being able to afford to feed their cats.
Ending an economic system geared to just shaving off money each step of the way will also be anti Semitic. That would be like a new Holocaust.
I would love to see Trump do all these things.

            Trump and the Tech Bros gave away the game last week.   They mean to replace Americans with Indians and other groups.   The middle men will be replaced with other more efficient middle men and managers.  Of course the ultimate top tier “Middle Men” will remain the same however the lower tier ones will be replaced.
Notice Trump doesn’t even think Americans can be good waiters.

                    Exactly.  So what took 2-3 generations to occur, takes 4 years to correct?  Doubtful.  The crux of the problem is not the ”cure” so much as the length of “treatment”.  Will the patient endure, or die in the process?

                        Trump can make a recess appointment, but he’ll probably just replace RFK with a Pajeet. “I love India. Indians. Great people. Love ’em. I get along great with Modi.”
And that’ll be that.

            The process will be slow to be sure, but if offshoring becomes unprofitable, it must be brought back to this shore.  Note, the “great migration” of the twenties of Blacks from the South was a product of Northern factories needing labor in their plants.  There seems to me to be a possibility for employment of the working class, perhaps at the expense of some middlemen—but this is a shift, not an elimination of jobs.  Blacks may gain as well as lose.

                Blacks would gain from a decent education system with less money sloshing around for overpaid union members and more focus on standards and discipline, teaching students skills and trades for success and independence rather than meaningless and useless college degrees.(Well, wouldn’t we ALL gain from that?)

                        No, the teacher’s unions hold down the schools from achieving the best they can with the material they have.  They do this because they don’t give a crap about students, but rather they promote the interests of their teachers above the students/parents interests.
The list of support for this assertion is long, but has been touched on before.  The teacher’s unions are politically extreme Left.  They refuse to allow any alternative to public schools.  They lobby consistently for higher salaries and less work load.  They protect to the extreme incompetent teachers from accountability.
What can go wrong?

                                Kind of true, but I still support unions.  Probably not in their current form (almost all of them support left wing politicians/parties), but they are about the best hope workers have when dealing with their bosses.

Concurrently, reduce the female percentage of teachers and professors to 10%, with these concentrated primarily in K through second grade. After that, boys need and deserve male teachers and male guidance.

                                Funny you should mention men in teaching positions for the appropriate modeling to young men—especially in HS.I remember now my years in HS—way back when.  My chem teacher was a WWII vet who rebuilt Sherman’s in the rear while in Europe.  He had stories….My teacher in World Affairs (or whatever they called it) was a fighter pilot recently retired after a few tours in Vietnam.  He had stories….My PE/Typing instructors were a couple of Marines with Vietnam tours.  They didn’t have stories.  They just treated us like boots in basic.  PE became geared to passing the current Marine Core Physical Fitness exam all recruits in those days had to pass and therefore in their class we had to pass.  Shit, I was like 14-15 year old! I guess he figured we were all potential canon fodder, so get your head straight and your ass in gear.  We did!Ray, you’ve never been so right…I was blessed to live in those days.

                                As I just pointed out to my 18 y.o. college freshman son, it only recently occurred to me that I had only ONE female teacher between 9th grade (HS was an old-time Jesuit prep school) and my last semester of college.ONE!(A nice woman; I was a star pupil in her Russian Lit. class, and she was “nudging me toward a continued relationship with The Academy.” But I wanted to go join the World of Grownups, and she became – get this! – unreconcilably miffed at my nonchalance and desire to finish my degree “on schedule” – that is, in four years. I wanted out, at least in the short term, and she was not happy about things as they were ;-).Anyway, it’s becoming obvious to me that my lad prefers “the male communication style”, and has trouble with nudges, yentas, and feelsters in the classroom.

                            I don’t necessarily disagree about the unions, but is that a bad thing?  Unions represent the teachers, that’s why they exist.  The kids have plenty of representation and advocates.It’s easy to stand outside the system and ‘point and shriek’ about unions like the average Republican. But they ain’t the ones surrounded by 30 kids all day.  When those kids are from the inner city, it ain’t exactly an easy environment.  In some sense, this is what they signed up for, but they also were sold a bill of goods in university about how the diverse keeds are just misunderstood future scholars.There is research showing that kids who apply for a voucher but don’t get it do as well on average as the kids who apply and get it. (Ryan Faulk covers this pretty well)  Plus, it’s very misleading to compare charter and private schools to public schools.  Charter and private schools are cherrypicking students almost by definition.  The 2 parent families who really care about their kid’s education send them to private school or get them into charter schools if possible.  While every crackhead with 3 keeds all by differnet men send their kids to the public school.The more privatization of education, the worse this becomes.  The public schools cannot get rid of bad students either. They become a dumping ground of the undesirables.

                                    I agree.  Up until the 50s, the HS graduation rate was in the 40s.`  While I am sure there were economic hard cases in that drop-out rate, most dropped out when their ability to learn new material hit a brick wall determined by a combination of work ethic and IQ.  Insisting on keeping kids in school is probably the single largest problem in public education.

Yep, you’ve hit on it.  We keep students in school who should not be there. Thus disrupting the education of all others and the lowering of standards so that we can pretent the “races are equal”.  Couple that with court mandated “mainstreaming” of students with physical and emotional disability and you have a recipe for mediocrity.

                                        I grew up around a lot of dropouts from that era, and for the most part, it was not that they couldn’t handle it, but rather that they could not come up with a reason to learn junk that they would never need in their chosen career. At that time, mostly ranching and wrenching.
Somewhere along the line we got the nutty idea that kids actually need to know something called “social studies” and it’s been downhill from there.

                                Agree and can confirm.As I suggested above: maybe there is some kind of minimal level of public school for the lowest achievers that becomes a feeder school for the vocations such as janitor or garbage man, for our higher brethren.And then the vocational schools for Our People are completely separate institutions, where it’s a straight meritocracy for engineers or  carpenters or plumbers.im just spitballing some ideasBut I know that current Millienal elem teachers did NOt sign up for 2-3 Sha’qwans in their class, taking up all the teaching / discipline time while 17 other Bobbys, Chens, and Marios manage to sit quietly and want to learn.

                            Compsci:I agree with you on the hard Left teachers unions.But with regard to them lobbying for a lower workload: that may be true (I am not in one), BUt I can confirm that teachers in the gubmit schools (elem) are having more and more laws and regs pushed on them that they are supposed to implement.And it suffocates teacher creativity and ability to focus on what they want to do and / or see that individual students need.But at this point, the ones who are in the classroom are at minimum Millenials, and so have never experienced the freedom of teaching what one desires.IMO, the only way to make any of this better is to gradually eliminate public schools, and the DoE, and use the tax money for parents to choose a private school (voucher system.)AND– it should be separated by both rayycce and other factors. Like maybe have vocational feeder schools for janitors, for our jogger brethren.

                    The problem isn’t that we don’t have a decent education system for them.  This is just a different version of blame whitey for everything.  Like we’re somehow withholding education from them because we are mean and we hate them and setting them up for failure.If we set up an experiment where we bussed 100% of the kids in the ghetto to a “good school” and bussed 100% of the kids from the “good school” to the school in the ghetto, the school in the ghetto would become a top performing school.  The “good school” would become one of the worst performing schools.The problem ain’t the school, it’s the kids.

                        Bingo! And antecedent to the kids, it’s the baby mamas and baby daddies. It’s a whole culture; a whole mentality. And it’s richly subsidized by cash transfer payments, and when you subsidize a thing, you necessarily get more of it.

                            And that ‘whole culture’ is not something that can be taught or replaced; it is a product of their genetics.  Assimilation (of different races and religions) is a lie.

                                Not entirely: predominantly, perhaps, but not entirely.
From my perspective, I simply want to minimize exposure to profound, antisocial dysfunction.
(PS – assimilation CAN (maybe…) work in some instances,in proper measures,and with varying degrees of success, as i have born witness, but never, never, in a feminized culture, as there is inevitably a need for “the impetus of the blackjack”. And mommy don’t like that.)

                                    There are exceptions to everything, of course, but they do not disprove the generalization.  Plus no one wants to pin down what ‘assimilation’ actually means.  Selena Gomez’s (crying about the deportation of “my people”) father is the anchor baby of Mexican mestizos.  Is she “assimilated?”  Usha Vance was born to ‘legal’ Indian immigrants, so her half-White children are second generation on her side.  But who watched them while she worked?  Vance’s mother was inrehab, so I am assuming they’ve had a heavy Indian cultural influence via their maternal grandparents, whoraised their mother as a ‘devout Hindu.”  Will they be ‘assimilated?”

                                    You are simply refusing to accept reality.  Could it be less dysfunctional?  Possibly.  But the reality is, the environment is not a separate thing that can be isolated and changed.To the extent we can make improvements to the environment, nobody would be allowed to do it.  We are doing the exact opposite of improving the environment.  Black kids cannot be disciplined in schools, for example.  Any attempt at discipline is framed as White supremacy!What they should have is a zero tolerance policy.  You disturb the class, you’re expelled.  You fight or sell drugs in or around school, you are arrested and expelled.  Threaten or hit a teacher, you’re arrested and expelled.  Unfortunately, even if we could do these things, we cannot help them at home. We cannot choose their friends and acquaintances. We cannot change the neighborhood they live in.

        From what I’ve seen in the past week or so, it appears there are a whole lot of people now who are open to Trump’s reforms. We haven’t seen the caterwauling like we did in 2016 or 2020. There are still a lot of kooks and managerial goons out there for sure, like there are still people who watchSurvivor, but they do not appear to be overwhelming like they did a few short years ago. We are witnessing both a vibe shift and a preference cascade, so the managerial goons will fall in line. If Trump doesn’t step on his dick like he did for his last administration.I think a big test will the cascade of sob-stories and self-righteous moralizing coming from the deportations. If these fall flat, I think reform might be easier than we thought.

                Joe Biden turned out to be the perfect personification of late stage liberalism: corrupt and intellectually exhausted. With the passing of the gerontocracy, it is incompetent hysterics all the way down.
The real problem in short to medium term will be the cryptos and conversos on our own side, determined to wreck the transformation, as they did with Reagan, Gingrich and the Tea Party.

Asking everyone, do you personally know anyone who is more open to Trump and what he represents now than they were in 2016? I don’t.
Who are these masses of people who are suddenly open to Trump? Hispanic men? Californians who lost their homes to fire?
I hear about this supposed preference cascade but I can’t find any evidence of it with actual people.  Maybe I’ve overlooked the overwhelming evidence.

                It’s not just a conversion of people from anti to pro Trump, but also the degree of change in lukewarm supporters.  I know a lot of normies that were receptive to the Trump message, but could not support the messenger because of his crudeness.  Now they are all in, openly laughing at the left, and joyfully anticipating what Trump will do next. Just one example is the media criticizing the J6 pardons for people who “assaulted the police.”  Normies used to fall for this nonsense, but now they see right through it.

                Among the hoi-polloi, I don’t see much difference. If you’re at a certain age or  still consume mainstream media, you have the same opinions of Trump that you did in 2016. I was referring to the non-sack-of-potatoes people, the growing number of influencers who are at least agnostic towards Trump this time around. Some are even apologetic like Zuck and Chris Cilizza. I think that the madness we’ve experienced was one of those things that happens from time to time, when a moral crusade looks unstoppable, and either scares people or ignites the bully in other people, and good men do nothing. Now the good men are free to vent their frustrations, and I think we’re going to see a lot of mea culpas in the next years. We don’t have to accept them, but it would be good to see.If Trump and his team stay the course, and the GOP doesn’t pussy out (like the Florida Republican legislature is doing; bad sign).

                Well, anecdotes are not data.I tend to agree, except for the fact that Trump did get a goodly share of the vote—and better than 2016.  Now these people might just be disgruntled with the last 4 years and Trump was the only alternative in our two party system.  That I give you.The fear I have is that an effective Trump tenure will entail pain and the electorate is fickle.  Who runs for reelection on the promise of more pain?  Worse, is there enough juice in the squeeze for another Potemkin “Morning in America” 2028 campaign?Effective, lasting change—if it comes at all—seems to me a process of more than a single term of the Presidency.  Our Founders designed it that way, they just couldn’t imagine the degeneracy we’ve fallen into.

                LITS,I’ll give an English perspective, for what it’s worth. Put simply, during Trump’s 2016-2020 tenure, a knew of a large number of people who loathed him. Every mention of his name would have them throw up their hands in anger: “What has the world come to!”, “Who put this idiot in charge!”…Fast-forward to the current time, those same people are discussing the EOs in quite a modest tone. People who used to just say “Drumpf” or “Trump” now address him as President Trump; in addition, a lot of the heated rhetoric has gone.Furthermore, and perhaps even more incredibly, in my work sector – which is ‘Tech’ (a stupid abbreviation, we must make things short and sweet so today’s NPCs understand it) – those very same people are makingalmost no noise at all about the EOs. And about Trump. They may disagree, and occasionally sat so publicly, but their tone is markedly more reserved.Of course, you asked if these people were now open to Trump, and I don’t believe so. But within this admittedly small sample set, their approach is now fair more lenient and, dare I say it,tolerant!Perhaps they’re relieved that WWIII didn’t start with BOM in 2016 like we wuz told, who knows. But it’s an interesting thing to watch.I pray you and yours are well.

                    I suspect that a lot of the silence or “tolerance” arises from fear of prosecution and imprisonment. And when the opinion leaders and the trend setters are cowed into relative silence, those who take their cues from the opinion leaders are too unsure of themselves to say much. Also, the shenanigans involved in the “nomination” of Kamala–“Yeah, we forced you all to vote for Biden in the primaries, and now we have taken him out of the running and, yeah, we really don’t need or even want your votes”–no doubt cost the Dems a lot of votes and soured the “undecided” voters on party loyalty. The engine of the Democrat Party seems to be running on fumes. There just might not be a lot of fuel left to kick up a fuss about EOs or anything else.

                I’m out here in a suburb of the Soviet of Seattle and wish I could say the neighbors I know are more open-minded than they were in 2016.There are some signs of life in some of the local press (e.g., mynorthwest.com) and bloggers/tweeters like Katie Daviscourt. But it still feels very much being like being behind enemy lines, where we have to watch what we say if we don’t want to provoke a swarm of leftist scolds. I’m not afraid of that myself, but the arguments with them are never productive and always so very tiresome.I wish I could move back to the midwest where I grew up around the Iowa/Illinois border but my ex has the kids and I want to stay near them.Edit: I might do that anyway. She’s got them thoroughly indoctrinated into the cult and it’s been years since they came to visit their old man with his troglodyte views.  I have half a mind to disinherit the ungrateful little … would that make me a stereotypical Boomer, taking it all with me into my grave?

        What goes around, comes around I guess.  This problem of “middlemen” has been talked about since the Nixon era.  Remember Earl Butz?…”Earl Butz, a prominent and influential U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, was known for advocating agricultural efficiency and large-scale farming practices. During his tenure in the 1970s, he often used visual demonstrations, including a loaf of bread, to illustrate the distribution of costs in agricultural production.On talk shows and public appearances, Butz famously held up a loaf of bread to highlight how little of its retail cost actually went to farmers. He pointed out that only a few cents of the total costs often quoted as around *four cents* represented the farmer’s share. The demonstration was intended to emphasize the economic challenges farmers faced, the value they provided in the food chain, and the efficiency of American agriculture in keeping consumer food prices relatively low.”  (ChatGPT)The demo aptly represented what Z-man sagely points out today.  Everyone except the farmer is rightfully considered a “middleman”, or perhaps more aptly a parasite grifting off the labor and productivity of the farmer.  Back in those days, the four cents on a loaf of bread might have been between 10-15% of the cost of the bread purchased in the supermarket.  Things have not gotten better since, I fear.

            The French government encourages “Farm-to-Table” buying, where consumers cut out the middleman and purchase directly from farmers.
It’s still possible here in the USA: for instance, drive through the Southern California countryside and you can buy big bags of oranges, grapefruits, avocados, etc. for just a few bucks (then go check out their prices in the urban supermarkets!).

                Yeah, but today the American housewife is too damn lazy or too damn busy with her out of the home job.  When I lived over in Europe, the housewife went to market every day for fresh food for lunch and dinner.  My aunt had one of those new fangled refrigerators which was about 2-3 cubic feet and held a bottle of Coke in it.  Nothing was stored and frozen.  Fresh food daily was purchased, prepared, and eaten—that day.  There might be a bag of biscuits for tea in the pantry.Aside from not preparing food each day for a meal, the American housewife buys her groceries weekly and stores them in the frig or pantry.  Hence everything is processed and prepared, like food in an bomb shelter, to last forever.

        “The only way to remedy this is to bring the costs back to the front of that frozen pizza and that can only be done through systemic change.”That’s a good way of describing Trump’s tariff policy.I’ve been reading Rasmus off and on for the last fifteen years or so (off for the last few years). I see he has a slew of new books out.But returning to the tariff policy. I think it can only work with consistent and determined effort, and over a time span of decades About 35 years back or so, an HBS professor wrote a book titled, “The Competitive Advantage of Nations.” If I can borrow this terminology, the USA’s competitive advantage is not great. Other countries have more well-trained workforces. They have stronger and more effective symbioses between government and their oligopolies. They already have up-and-running factories. And comparing like for like, their infrastructure is better and labor costs lower. The truth of the matter is that over the last quarter century or so, other countries have stolen a march, maybe two marches, over the USA, which has squandered precious resources on futile wars of choice and has seemingly operated without a national plan. To me the situation is too reminiscent of Britain, which has already trodden this path of decline and decay.

            We also have some natural advantages. Our workforce is vastly more productive than you see in Asia and South America. We still retain much of the high trust infrastructure that does not and cannot exist in Asia or Latin America. We also have vast natural resources. One of the reasons Russia weathered the sanctions storm is the had rebuilt the agricultural sector to be self-sufficient and not just for basics. Russian grocery stores put ours to shame with the bounty of products on the shelves at remarkably low prices.They also rebuilt their energy sector to first take care of domestic needs and then export needs. Russia is a country with cheap food and cheap energy, which means a relatively prosperous people, despite the sanctions. We can learn a lot from what they did following the collapse of communism. Putin has hinted at this when asked about pending talks with Trump. He points out that America is like Russia in that it produces lots of food and energy and consumes lots of food an energy.

                    True, we have a tendency to talk a lot of Black pills, but can you blame us?  Most of the conversation as I interpret it is valid consideration of the obstacles to a prolonged program of needed reform based upon past history, most of which is pretty spot on.

That used to be a quintessentially American attitude, right?
Still is, I’m sure, but we have this demographic problem in the meantime. Seriously, we Americans have let ourselves be smothered, and I’m convinced that’s the most of it.

                    Africa is at least as resource rich as the US in many areas and vastly more so in others,  yet much of those resources remain untouched and will remain untouched in perpetuity unless outsiders harness them. This is because Africans lack –thee– ‘resource’ required to get the other resources– Intelligence. And all that goes along with it, high trust society, social capital, technology, etc.Now that America more closely resembles Brazil with it’s vast swirl of muddy adulterated genetic misfits which is rapidly heading to completely brown who, pray tell, will be doing all this resource mining? Guillermo? Juanita? Tyrone? Shaniqua? Hardeep? Pooja? You tell me…If you are not up nights about the -primary- resource, Whiteness / Intelligence needed to harness nature and its raw materials you are living in griller delusion.Russia was able to turn the corner quickly because Russia is full of Russians. The US is full of… mutts.The only solution is, paradoxically, the Brazilian solution where the ‘natural order’ asserts itself and the whites rule over all others. But Brazilians don’t have tribal influence and a history of Puritanism inverting the natural social order. Until that is resolved, all the rest is conjecture. The competency crisis is real and accelerating with each new brown tidal wave that arrives or is born here.

Nail on head.  “America”, or whatever we call this dump now was able to make comebacks in the past because it was still a White country.  Not only is it not a White country any longer, it isn’t a real country at all.  It is the world’s flea market and strip mall.

                The ability to be a truly independent country is one of our great strengths. If we closed the borders and focused on fixing our house we could do it in a generation with good leadership and the right ideology. We have a very abundant country. Only a wealthy country can fail at the magnitude we are seeing.
We have allowed bad leadership to run the ship aground. The 1793 solution makes more sense the more time goes by and the more information that comes out.

            I think the British had fewer street poopers and destroyed cities.Less diversity and child mutilation also.I wonder what the IQ of Britain in 1960 was compared to the US today? Or crime rates:US murder rate is over 4x that of Britain or even France.
For better and for worse the path the US is on is unique.

        “The bigger problem is the transition cost, which will come in the form of recession. There is no escape from it.”People keep saying this, but I just don’t believe it is true. I think the past 5 yearswerethe recession, just that the government/media/economists have lied about it, and pushed fraudulent statistics to try to gaslight people.Ignore the government pronouncements and look at what has happened with the real economy since the covid psy-op was launched:The prices of food, energy, housing and healthcare continue to sky-rocket — way faster than any increase in wagesCrime has sky-rocketedALL the new jobs have gone to foreigners. The number of actual Americans employed has decreased and remains below pre-covid levels.Many of the “employed” Americans are working two part-time jobs and or “gig” work to survive.Small business and even tech startup formation have cratered. Virtually all business investment now goes to the A.I. bubble (you are dead-on with the “palace economy” comparison)Most of us are old enough to have lived through multiple recessions and we know what they look and feel like. Everyone outside the “palace” knows the economy is terrible.Up-ending everything will not cause short-term pain, it will bring immediate relief. When you are constantly being *cheated* on every transaction, doing fewer of them will immediately be to your benefit!

China’s Deepsix AI versus Fink’s Aladdin, for instance, would be a battlefield innovation with as much impact as drones and ‘hypersonic’ rocketry.
High-frequency trade wars and AI commercial lawfare might hand our ruling class a set of problems that would slap that smirk right off their face.

                They can. It’s taken decades to get over this fascination with Keynes, and have been dragged kicking and screaming  into accepting more classical economics, especially the Cantillon Effect. I think the original design of the Fed was based on Cantillon’s insights, but being greedy bastards, wanted all the things NOW. The current managers are much more patient.
The wildcard is Congress. When they pull more moronic stunts like COVID Cash, that can’t but push consumer inflation.

                I think she has good female genetics, she has just spent her whole life living in a social world where pretending to care a great deal about ‘the other’ is rewarded and not doing so is punished. The contrast in attitude with Spaniards that actually live among and rule over that population is amusing. This girl’s very existence demonstrates half a millennia of hard core dedication to racial awareness.

        Sharp. Two contradictory things are true:Massive economic reform, which in effect is a return to normality, is necessary to restore a decent quality of life; andIt currently is politically and culturally impossible without possible violence to make any economic changes that threaten the managerial class.In other words, we are in the USSR circa 1989. We focus on the relative lack of bloodshed that accompanied the Soviet Union’s end, but that it ended at all let alone non-violently is the most amazing part. The elite faction then that overcame the managerial class was in fact a rogue portion of it. Here in the present, the rogue elite comes from the economic sector, which is somewhat outside the system. Given how dependent its wealth is on the state as presently constituted, wouldn’t even that faction be resistant to most economic change? Or does it see a path to more profit and viability outside of the system as currently constituted? And more importantly, does the rogue (or new, possibly) elite’s interests even align with ours?Those answers are outside of my pay grade. What I do know is the our people benefit if a faction of the rising elite accepts and wants a lower population level. I just don’t see such a faction since even those who advocate the necessary economic changes, to the degree they do, still cling to the old ideas about GDP and population.

            Certainly, there has been a move to increase population through immigration, but is the reason monolithic or varies among interest groups?  In short, can these groups be split and objections overcome?  For example, Dem’s want a voting population for political control.  What if these folk no longer have the franchise?  What if factory IA workers no longer can work due to tightened enforcement?

                Ending the demand is the right approach. Since I subscribe to elite theory more or less, that’s the group that matters. How to end its demand for a constant flow of people? I do think the violence and upheaval associated with open borders frightened some factions. But as we saw with the H1B debacle, elites still want immigration of some kind. How to end that demand? They flagrantly violate and ignore laws at this point, so this has to be an approach of making bad people do good things. I think the United States is far past the tipping point, but the fewer aliens in any carve-outs, which are coming and even happening now, the better. The demand for them has to dry up. I’m looking at this from outside of political solutions now.

                    Even H1b VISA’s can be reworked.  What is the reason for these workers to be offered citizenship for example?  Why do we not enforce more tightly the concept of not allowing such people to *replace* current US employees.  Seems we used to have a program for migratory farm workers to come up from MX, then go home.  Same should be done with H1b’s.  They can go home and apply for legal immigration under their countries’ quota allocation.

                        The H1B’s have been reworked quite a bit to our detriment. The “Left” got onboard when it realized Green Cards would be issued eventually to their holders. If the Tech Bros were thoughtful they would be floating a revision now to that effect, but they don’t care about the racial and cultural problems. Immigration always is bad.

                        “What is the reason for these workers to be offered citizenship for example?”There’s a process from going from H1B to Green Card. This is because the H1B operates on the “principle of dual intent” (unlike the work program for Mexican agricultural workers). The H1B to Green Card is not straightforward and involves obstacles and delays. At the current time, it supposedly takes decades (I’m not joking) for an Indian H1B to get a Green Card. Other nationalities (e.g., West European) are probably much faster. American workers get shafted by H1B migrant workers but the H1B migrant workers get shafted in a different way by having a Green Card tantalizingly out of reach. The tech overlords want a working population of anxious and terrified indentured servants who can be underpaid and overexploited.

        Tariffs will not be enough and especially not targeted tariffs.  A lot of production is leaving China, but it’s not coming home to the US. Most of it is going to other Asian countries. Mexico is another country production is move to.  The mountains of regulations that have built up in the US since the 60s, not to mention the army of lawyers, makes us extremely uncompetitive.  The hollowing out of manufacturing over a long period of time has resulted in a workforce lacking the skills necessary for manufacturing.

                    The troubles with Toyota’s quality assurance is troubling.  I need to hear more about it to understand what happened. Toyota was able to open up a factory in Tennessee moving from Japan.  My first truck came from there.  It was rock solid—even when built by Americans and Detroit cars were suffering in quality.
I’m still not convinced you can’t build a good car in MX.

            Peter Thiel openly stated this. As usual, there was no emotion, no empathy, no concern. Just a fact that he will exploit while we are left to our own devices.As for the workforce training, the old mentality couple with an ability to enact real reform is the biggest obstacle. We have more than enough people: immigration attorneys; bullshit tech jobs; bullshit “journalist” jobs; bullshit government jobs; bullshit “H1B” visas; foreign domiciled tech jobs at American companies; bullshit NGO jobs (government jobs by another name); people paid not to work; people paid to barely work … …; bullshit university jobs; bullshit jobs in service to the people doing bullshit jobs … …While efficiency through experience would take some time, we could transition those people into real jobs and in a short period of time they could be getting it done. It would take some time for them to get proficient, but it would be done.You would destroy many castles. You would have your jobs that Americans would no longer be able choose to turn their noses up at. I would love to have that blonde fat cunt in Chicago as an immigration attorney crying over deporting double-criminals, (here illegally and committing other crimes to boot), get a job on a docking bay. Of course, after she is last in line and has to live in an apt. with 20 illegals to make ends meet while they wait for deportation and she waits for her interview.Wishes/fantasies aside, this is the other issue with America. We just sent people to college with no structure no real legitimate job forecasting just guestimates and it is total chaos. It is time to make the industries forecast labor and build a farm system of Americans to train for jobs and careers. This is a major structural change that needs to be made.If we are to be serfs to corporate America they should have a duty to at least choose some of us and invest something in us and display some amount of loyalty. American firms need to play an active role in development and recruiting. Of course, they moved in this direction in ’20 because the left partnered with them. Of course, that was a racial patronage system that froze Whites out.

                I agree wholeheartedly.  I wasn’t advocating for the status quo and using it as an excuse.  I’m just saying tariffs alone are not enough, even if they were just generic import tariffs and not specific to this country or that country.

        “The biggest challenge in this project is a dysfunctional managerial class that sees any change as a challenge to their position.”  That and the fact millions of low quality swarthy invaders have taken up squatting residence in this rapidly devolving country.  It’s going to be long hard slog to say the least.

            Look, the return on the pension funds of the managerial class are what’s driving the need for inflation; that those and the public fund pools are controlled by the politicians is what’s driving the bust-out.The crooks are getting money to run, the managerials are getting money to put up a walled estate; if white people start training their own children again in the technological arts we invented, we could offer them a places to run to, perhaps, and get them on our side.Very tenuous, a fragile soap bubble against a tidal wave, but what are ya gonna invest in?Another burned-out slum ‘redevelopment’ or the Amanda Colonies where Amish have a factory building the Radarange stovetop microwaves?(More likely, that Pennsylvania factory making the missile shell casings, and Venezuelan indentured migrants working the North Carolina quartz mine.)

        The collapse of manufacturing in the USA coincided with the environmental movement, and the creation of the EPA under Nixon. For example it quickly became far more expensive to make steel in the USA, making many products uncompetitive. Until we eliminate these governmental restrictions on manufacturing, we’re not likely to see much manufacturing here in the USA.

            It’s a matter of cost, is it not?  The great arbitrage of off shoring is both in wages and environmental/safety cost.  Can’t see why a profitable enterprise can’t start here if tariffs are employed appropriately to account for such arbitrage.

                No. Stop focusing on the money. They can create more money with a few keystrokes. Focus on the wealth, and consequent purchasing power. That’s not nearly as easy to create.Take cars. Say you need a 50% tariff to account for the arbitrage.Cet. par., cars will necessarily be 50% higher, plus vig. Except they can’t because there are not all that many who can swing that kind of payment. So things will settle at a new price somewhere between the two, but most critically, with tens, hundreds of thousands of people priced out of the market entirely. Most of whom are young, and ideally should be starting a family, but there is no house in the suburbs in the offing, because he is stuck riding the bus.

                    This is a lot easier to see if you pick a product that cannot be imported. Houses, for instance. This is effectively a massive tariff. 1000%, maybe.
But even with that, housing starts have not kept up. Shoot, our best ever was around 2.5 million in Nixon’s administration, with around 200 million people. Now with half again the number of people, and a plethora of illegals, we are around 1.5 million, and more expensive, even if you factor in inflation and hedonics.
If protectionism were the answer, why isn’t it the answer for houses?

        Excellent points about the transition of our economy from producers to FIRE skimmers, which is why our so-called GDP is more than 70% services, most of them unnecessary in a sane world…Another way of looking at it is Michael Hudson’s view that we have transitioned from an economy where the government provided the necessary infrastructure for development, including sound education through HS, while the producers produced…to a managerial government that ignores infrastructure and has made itself the main middleman in every deal through a vast cloud of regulations..

        Recession being necessary for change presents some different problems than it did in the 1930s, thanks to demographic changes. Not only are we not the same country that we were back then, we won’t be the same country at the end of the recession that we will be at the beginning of it (because I am convinced this next one will be long and deep). Which begs the question of how capable a workforce made up of 3rd world muds will be at digging out of a recession, and how far out of it they can dig. Whatever the percentage of them ends up being relative to whites, it is uncharted territory. Looking for historical analogy, I don’t think the “economic miracle” in Europe in the 1950s happens quite the same way with a bunch of Somalis. I don’t doubt that Guatemalans are able and willing to do the grunt work, but the economy they immigrated from is not noted for its innovation. And this is all without getting into the already existing political divisions which recession will not exactly ameliorate.

                China has a robot factory that claims to build an electric vehicle every 31 seconds. It seems they skipped right past the need to import immigrants, despite having a billion workers already at hand.
That raises a seperate question.  Why would China need to outsource to Vietnam and the like?  Aren’t they a controlled economy, a national socialismus state for the Chinese people?

            Proof in the pudding: my Nebraska friend was the factory mechanic for meat processors.Of course, management brought in Somalis to do the grunt work, freezing out the locals.
Two years later, my friend’s job was helping to dismantle and shut down those plants.  They are ‘relocating’.
Now that an enormous lithium bed has been found on the Idaho border, perhaps our imported Africans can be useful there, a mini Congo of our own.

        Makes good sense. And I got a ‘Cognitively Disabled’ grade in Econ. 101.One thing Trumpster did right first time ’round was the econ and financial stuff.

They will drag you down to the bottom of the national lake.It’ll take more than economic legerdemain to fix the U.S.  You will need deep and painful social reform concerning woke and feminism, the main adversaries of said strong and trustworthy men.

        Trump is trying to do high-quality acrobatics on a narrow plank connecting the tops of two 70-floor Trump towers, when such acts are difficult even on the ground.
Good luck to him !!

        Herr Musk certainly isn’t helping the American worker with his soon to be released Tesla Optimus.https://www.tesla.com/en_eu/AIIf there was ever a time for Luddite resurgence, it’s now.Just kidding! Industrial automation will never go away, no matter how much the Unions scream. Here in Germany Hans and Jorge over at the VW plant who have been manually assembling cars for the past 30-years are finished. And their kids can forget about working there too.It’s not enough Germany off-shored to Eastern Europe. German industrial automation companies were quite happy to sell their equipment to China. Now that China has copied and duplicated all that wonderful German engineering, no one is buying German equipment anymore because they don’t need to.When it comes to world class VW engineering, they can’t even sell their vehicles in China because they’re not competently priced. For example, the VW Vizzion is actually 57% cheaper in China than in Europe.Back to Optimus, the advert is typical for anyone dreaming of a personal helper to clean the house, make dinners, walking the dog or mow the lawn and is expected to become integrated into our lives. At least for anyone with $30k they don’t know what else to do with.Of course for industries who are tired of paying people to do manual labor, health benefits and contributing to their retirement funds, Optimus is a wet dream to the finance  department. They can not only rid themselves of all those pesky employees in production, but also in HR, logistics, etc. For any job which was not so easily automated before (manually loading complex parts into welding fixtures) Optimus offers the perfect solution. See the BMW link below.And why would farmers hire low wage workers to work their fields harvesting tomatoes or asparagus when these robots can do the same work 24-7-365?Didn’t someone once say when all the skilled manuals jobs are gone, they can always work in McDonalds? I can see where those people will be out the door too if Elon has anything to say about it.Optimus isn’t some futuristic dream of the future. It’s a viable reality just like the personal PC of the last century, the iPhone in 2007 and self driving vehicles today.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pwqqdVukx0&amp;ab_channel=BestInTESLAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq1QZB5baNw&amp;ab_channel=Figurehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlUFoZstcWg&amp;ab_channel=Figure

            UBI, or paying people not to work, would not be a shock to the AINO economy or a large additional cost. It is already largely the reality. They’ve already dropped a lot of the facade of forcing people to show up at the office, where they were already getting paid for doing little to nothing that was productive.

                True, but at least they had to report to work and spend some time in a regimented environment “pretending” to do productive efforts.  What happens when one is simply “kept”.  That is to say, freed from the basics of work for food, clothing, and shelter?  Have we not seen this in our welfare ghettos?  UBI for all?  So far we’ve had no successful (to my limited knowledge) experiments.As to the cost, UBI heretofore was proposed as a *replacement* for all welfare payments, that is why the cost seemed reasonable at the time.  This now seems impossible as folks tend to fight for their welfare goodies in all their various forms.  Hence the failure of experimental UBI programs.

                            Margaret Sanger tried to tell us.  She was against abortion, but advocated ‘family planning’. Some states had sterilization programs; California, relatively recently, enforced Norplant for a few as a trial.
The small-hatted folks who industrialized the abortion industry needed body parts to sell, so here we are.
(Don’t even get me started on their global network of body parts from children and adults, or their adrenochrome vampires.)
I can see why the corporate boards want to turn us all into GMO-tagged patented inventory.  That’s what remains after the FIRE economy is absorbed by AI.

                    The ghetto is the ghetto because of who’s in it, not economics. White people “kept” via UBI would do white people things. The ones who have it in them to ghettoize already do. Our worst people by far—cops and soldiers—retire earliest, and even they rarely succumb to sloth/squalor/etc. My income for many years has come from still getting paid for one thing I did when I was young, rather like lottery winnings. Since then, I’ve done all the same things I was already doing, and my crime rate is zero (until Trump gets us for antisemitism). We are who we are. Libertarians are wrong abouteverything.I’m sure it’ll come up, so I’ll mention it first: The “lottery winners are all broke in [some small number of] years” factoid is based on a faked study (as studies usually are). Lottery winners do exceptionally well unless they get scammed—byhardworking businessmen.People like the idea of losers (or accidental winners) being cursed. Americans’ idea of justice ispunishment for everythingexcept “hard work” (enriching bankers, obeying the managerial class—or doing nothing, ever, and lying about it, like Elon does). It’s not a natural attitude—not for white people.Who instills this ghetto morality?

                        This seems true, but I note we have a projected demographic of less than 50% White by perhaps 2050. Further, there is  no shortage of White trash who will sit on their ass and drug out on their UBI checks.

                Agreed. Many companies in Germany allowed people to continue to work home office after the pandemic and productivity didn’t change. I knew plenty of people in my company who weren’t doing anything except keeping a chair warm, so when they got to say home, they actually made more money simply by not commuting.

            The electricity industry is telling us that by 2027–roughly 24 months from today–artificial intelligence will consume as much electricity as the Netherlands does today. And given that *only* the Southern Company (Georgia Power, Alabama Power, Mississippi Power) has built nuclear reactors in America over the past 50 years (all four of which are in Georgia), and given the fact that Germany–Germany!–for example, has shut down its nuclear facilities in favor of “renewables,”and given the *fact* that the EU is forging ahead–successfully so far–with the whole carbon superstition thing, one has to wonder where the electricity will come from to power not only AI but also kitchen stoves (now that Biden has “outlawed” gas stoves), electric vehicles, and electronic “currencies,” etc., etc., not to mention their total-surveillance police state and social-credit systems. The people running the show worldwide are either stupid or evil. Evil, that is, if their plan really is depopulation, in which case, rationing electricity or even cutting most people off from it will be necessary for them to get rid of most of us. Which means that violent revolutionary uprisings are inevitable worldwide. Most Western countries will have ceased to exist in their present forms within the next ten years or sooner.

                It seems under the new Trump administration, common sense and being in touch with reality are going to become fashionable again.He may even have an influence here as many UE political figures are openly stating that many of the policies that Trump is pushing for (5% NATO contributions) is absolutely correct. It was correct when he was in office before and it’s correct now that he’s back.Nothing like watching a bear eat your neighbor to make you realize you’re not as safe as you think!Same with energy policies which have devastated the German and European economy. America First is exactly the wake up call Europe needs to start pulling ourselves up by our own bootstraps. We have plenty of resources (coal, iron, etc.) to stimulate our own economy if we can get out from under the stupidity of liberal Green policies.There is talk about starting up nuclear plants in Germany, But if the Berlin Airport project was any example of what we can expect it will take 10-years just to decide what color the workers toilets should be.Hopefully Trump’s leadership and influence on the EU will change the direction we are heading which we all desperately need.

        I think Trump has an overly simplistic view of how all this is going to work.  Does he imagine throwing some tariffs on some countries will force industry to magically re-shore en masse?  Even if it that did happen, do we have an adequate workforce of machinists, CNC operators and other jobs necessary for re-industrialization?  Are we training enough Americans to acquire these skills?  If not, are we just going to import more Eastern Europeans to do these jobs?  Kind of defeats the whole purpose.

            First things first. We can all envision scenarios of failure. First thing, businesses consider reshoring. Second thing, personnel. Not all businesses require machinists and CNC operators. In order to get those people, one must first have employment opportunities awaiting training in those specialties.
But you have a point.  We may well have a problem with our glorified, elites who now populate our managerial class and are too good to do the manual, blue collar trades they are best suited for.  Too bad.

        It is hard to understand what is coherent and what is incoherent at least as what applies to the oligarchy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSG0fBJBcQ8Larry Ellison needs to keep growing Oracle’s bottom line. Can’t sell many more databases to the government? Negative interest rates at 0 are gone and the startups that fuel cloud services growth are gone or going away? What would you do? A $500 billion AI initiative.He’ll get growth, you’ll lose your job and you’ll get a surveillance state. Above all, we’ll become worse than China to beat China!!!!We’ve seen the labor part of this in Silicon Valley at the end of the DotCom 1.0. A glut of SEs were on the market and those employed at zombie companies were very expensive. So, they turned to India and offshoring to reduce costs. That hasn’t changed. It isn’t just the H1Bs, many of the older web properties whose growth is slowing and stock is not inflating due to ZIRP, are increasing the size of their offshore engineering operations.Z is right what he said a few days ago. Things have gotten way worse than they are telling us or Trump would not have been cleared to elbow out Kamala. There are times where you wonder if the menagerie of dystopian movies we live in boil down to Robocop and The Dark Knight. It almost seems too convenient and too organized the tech bros swooping in and proposing solutions to mass crime, cancer … …DOGE’s first act is to open requisitions for software engineers. They are going to automate government. Now, the positive side is, perhaps the Dem patronage networks will be burnt to the ground. The negative side is, what will become of all of us.I don’t know. We have to hold on and get ready for a wild ride. Perhaps what Anduril, Mach Industries … … are not preparing for war with China. Perhaps they are preparing for the war of finishing the looting of the empire and heavy handed enforcement. Prosperity and abundance through mass unemployment and displacement doesn’t seem like much of a plan.We could deal with privation and hardship. Burning all of the social capital to the ground and leaving the people for dead doesn’t seem like a good way to confront our problems.

        “The middleman economy was very good for the sorts of people who have a long list of impressive sounding credentials but view tangible accomplishment as a disqualifier. The army of managers in the managerial state cannot survive a transition out of a middleman economy. “
The good news is that when showing their credentials doesn’t stop events, they are pretty well out of ideas beyond there.

        As usual, an excellent analysis in common sense language. Now go deeper. Nothing changes until the environment changes; so recession may actually become depression if the neocons get their WW3 via a false flag. War is the best way to hide financial disaster. And if the SHTF, they want peons killing peons, and not them (hence the illegals among us). The fastest (and least harmful) bounce off the bottom is via housecleaning. This reality is an unfortunate but necessary bitch.

                Yeah, but you know how those flim-flam men are fast talkers. Easy to see how a simple farmer wouldn’t understand what he was signing up for, especially when he was worried about having to leave the farm unattended and chores undone while he took his crop to the market. Probably sounded to him like hiring a farm hand at an affordable wage…
And you know, simple folk tend to be trusting folk.

        The other thing Trump wants to do is repeal the income tax and move to a consumption (sales) tax.  This places great tax burden on bigger spenders, and it encourages thrift and shopping discipline.  Sales taxes would likely vary to ensure it’s not a regressive system.  Prepared foods = higher taxes.  Fresh and other shorter shelf life items = lower taxes.  Luxury goods higher.  Necessities lower.Oh and the abolition of income taxes eliminates (or greatly reduces) one of America’s most shameful skimming operations: tax prep and tax law services.  A lot of the trouble in Washington orbits around trying to manipulate tax law.  That won’t go away.  Lobbyists will try to reduce taxes on their products.  But 300M Americans would be free of the tax man’s boot.  Don’t like paying taxes?  Buy less.That in turn allows more domestic production and resets the economy to focus on wealth building rather than worshiping GDP growth.Done right, it’ll also help people get healthy financially, physically and mentally.

                    One absurd comment deserves another. You got a reply that fits your comment’s thoughtfulness quite well. Try again, you might do better—but I doubt.
