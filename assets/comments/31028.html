        Joe being a closeted gay apparently just jumped over my head. I thought the fact he finds himself surrounded by gays who chose the same line of business was meant to convey his detachment from the realities of New York.His relationship with Rizzo was decidedly non-sexual, and quite the archetype of friendship people at their lowest tend to form. This is what “saves” him in the eyes of the audience at the end. It is quite obvious that by the final act of the film he is on his way to achieving what he came to New York for (“I will recommend you to all my friends”), yet he decides to throw it all away for the sake of his dying friend.

        Easy Rider makes it blatant that drug culture was a top-down phenomenon, and Gary Webb exposed this in the 90’s. There isn’t much money in filthy movies vs wholesome movies, but there is a LOT of money in the drug business, especially for spies who need untraceable funding.Counterculture that encourages degeneracy and ultimately drugs and drug money for the CIA was never created by or enjoyed by normal people. But normal people who buy commodity products aren’t where the money is.It was only a matter of time before promoting alternative spirituality/sexuality/etc went full circle and actually put the freaks into power.

        Midnight Cowboy is like a beautiful tasty looking crossisant with crap in the middle. Its wonderfully acted and directed, but the story is about two loser perverts who are impossible to care about.  They are incredibly stupid, making the movie a serious version of “Dumb and Dumber”.Hollywood gave this picture the AA for best picture.   Its way of giving  Middle America the finger.Because the USA was still a 90 percent white country in the 70s, Hollywood couldn’t make movies full of POC’s or explicitly antiwhite movies like they do today. They had to make heroes out of criminals, religious minorities, losers, and Freaks of various sorts. Look at Bonne and Clyde.  All the “squares” are ugly, stupid, or vicious.  They deserved to get killed and robbed by our beautiful fun loving crooks.

        I was 18 when Midnight Cowboy came out, and I’ve never seen it, so my impulse to has obviously never amounted to much. But thanks for the appreciation of it you’ve provided, lest I ever consider watching it. What interest I have in degeneracy can easily be satisfied by true crime videos on YouTube*, so why watch a fictional treatment?* I don’t claim to be above this. I recently watched some videos on the 1995 Essex Moor/Range Rover gangland murders and found it interesting. But the point is that that that happened, and tells you something about a reality you hopefully never need to experience in person, rather than some scriptwriter’s fantasy version of reality sculpted to fit his politics.

        I’m making a separate post about the movie “Deliverance” because I think I made an important observation that I posted in a sub thread on this page.Deliverance was explicitly anti-southern and anti-rural. No question. Arguments about “Dueling Banjos” being a positive depiction of “hillbilly” culture notwithstanding.Examine the entire premise of the movie. It’s been a long time since I viewed it, but iirc a group of upper-middle class, educated city men with enough disposable income for a weekend camping/hunting/fishing trip decide to do so in rural Appalachia (Filmed in Northeast Georgia).The men aren’t all “Yankees” iirc, but they’re comfortably suburban, professional/businessmen types you’d find in any city, even in the South.Now take that premise and consider a movie plot where some wealthy aristocrats from colonial Europe are on Safari in Africa sometime in the late19th century. The idea is the same. Men who are more accustomed to eating off expensive china with real silverware, going on a hunting excursion in the wilderness of Africa.Along the way our group of men in Appalachia have a negative, violent interaction with hillbillies. The hillbillies are ignorant, uneducated, violent, subhuman, almost animals.Along the way our group of colonial Europeans  on safari run into a tribe of headhunters who stalk them and brutally kill and eat them.The theme and plot are no different. Both stories might vaguely depict the city men and the Europeans as overly civilized to the point of weakness, helplessness etc. … but clearly the depiction of the “other” is meant to contrast against ignorant subhumans.

            I haven’t seen it for decades either, but if I remember right their trip is to ride a river that’s soon to be dammed, flooding the area where all the hillbillies live. So the premise contains an assurance that regardless of what happens, the future will see their land and memory justly erased. I *think* the last shot is a long overhead to show you how large the low-lying area is.The guy who plays guitar with the kid is a stock real-life character of the time, a professional-class leftist who thinks himself Of The People because he knows a snippet of what academic archivists have preserved of the vanishing “folk.” The movie is *extremely* un-self-aware about this.

                    I gather that in the movie the “other” IS depicted as ignorant subhumans, so how is it “meant to contrast against” itself? As far as I can tell the sentence just doesn’t parse.
Yes, the inability to post very short responses when a very short response would do the job is annoying.

        Z, I’ve never read one of your film reviews. Nor have I seen Midnight Cowboy. But I’m impressed.
My favorite all-time film is John Sayles’ “Matewan” (1987) about West Virginia coal mining in the dangerous days of union organizing.
Maybe watch and review it some time.

        I think Hoffman’s character is named Rizzo, not Rico.Jon Voight’s performance is the film’s sole redeeming quality. (He was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to John Wayne.) He’s really, really good and really funny as Joe Buck. He milks the dumb hick in the big city thing for all it’s worth, but without turning it into a stupid cartoon.It’s been awhile since I watched the film, but I recall that Joe Buck specifically left Texas to go to New York in the first place because he thought it would be easy to make a living there as a male prostitute servicing rich women. He’s a tall, good-looking guy (in a corn-fed country boy sort of way), and is clearly supposed to be the male version of the dumb girl who is the prettiest thing in her small town, so she thinks she can make it in Hollywood, then she gets there and gets suckered into working in porn.Anyway, like I said, Voight’s funny and sad performance was the main reason to watch it, if you watch it at all.

        I don’t believe I saw any comments referencing “Deliverance” – a film that also featured Mr. Voigt. Came out a few years later than MC and the white hillbillies were the devils. The first viewing of it put me down – like depressed. But then a subsequent viewing … I really did laugh a couple of times.

            “Uh, what we REE-quire is that you get your ass up in them woods.”
I agree that the hillbillies didn’t come across particularly well in Deliverance, but the deputy and the sheriff–played by James Dickey–were alright, and the folks in the bed-and-breakfast at the end of the movie were decent people. At any rate, Deliverance wasn’t anti-white propaganda. It was a story about the fact that the barbarians are always outside the gates, that you’d best be aware of that fact and prepare accordingly.

                “Deliverance wasn’t anti-white propaganda. It was a story about the fact that the barbarians are always outside the gates, that you’d best be aware of that fact and prepare accordingly.”.I have to disagree with you, Ostei.  It it wasn’t anti-white, it was certainly anti-RURAL white.  Deliverance came on the heels of a series of wholesome rural-based sitcoms by CBS (derisively called the Country Broadcasting System for its rural -based programming)  Andy Griffith Show, Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Jct, Green Acres all showed rural Americans in a positive light, despite their outward simplicity and naïveté.  Deliverance turned that on its head and showed that you city-folk better best beware when driving over that hill for a toothless, banjo-pickin’, inbred hillbilly boy could be waiting to pounce.  That movie set rural Americans (especially Appalachians) back a hundred years from which, I will argue, they have never recovered.

                    I dare say Deliverance advanced hillbilly music a century. “Dueling Banjos” was a smash hit, and the scene in which that song is played was electrifying–even though the music was acoustic–and showed that the rural folk had tremendous musical talent. You’ll recall that city slicker guitarist Drew (Ronnie Cox) ultimately couldn’t keep up with the young country banjo prodigy.

                        The banjo scene was the movie equivalent of a National Geographic special (when they were redeemable instead of antiwhite) where native Africans in some jungle tribe are depicted as primitive, superstitious, maybe even cannibals, but there’s some sort of academic appreciation for their music, dance, art, and culture.
Think of the city-folk as European colonizers on safari, (literally on a hunting/fishing trip) documenting and observing a tribe of primitive Appalachian people.

            I  have never seen midnight cowboy, however I did read the Mad magazine take on as a kid.That and now your review is enough, thank you for dealing with it. I have seen s couple other films from the Era  Easy rider of course, taxi driver. The Billy jack movies etc.There is one I still enjoy every few years, Little Big Man. Dustin Hoffman plays the title character but the guy I really enjoy is Chief Dan Gerorge , he was the real deal a first nation’s chief from western Canada. ( An Indian)He was also in The outlaw Josey Wales . Anyway the movie is typical for that Era. Preachy, most whites bad, most indians good. but humorous at least.Fay Dunaway was also in itPretty sure she could still make me write bad checks..It might not be most people’s cup of tea but it’s not completely degenerate IMO.

            Thank you for reminding me of Voight’s role in Deliverance. I had forgotten about him, I tend to mostly remember Burt Reynolds and Ned Beatty from that movie for some reason. Ned Beatty mostly for the rape scene. Burt, I guess, because he’s Burt Reynolds, and everybody liked Burt Reynolds back then.That movie is undoubtedly one of the most anti-southern, anti-rural movies ever made. It’s only redeeming quality is the banjo scene, 100% for the music, but not for the “creepy inbred hillbilly”  innuendo that it hamfists onto the screen.That movie was created for the sole purpose of making people who are more comfortable living in Manhattan than Montana feel superior to those of us who have some idea how to clean our own fish and grow a real vegetable garden.Having said this, I find it particularly odd that John Voight turned out to be so “right-wing” sympathetic. I definitely don’t think he’s one of us, but he’s right up there with Mel Gibson, James Woods, Kelsey Grammar, Vince Vaugn, etc as far as Hollywood actors goes. They live in a world where it is career suicide to not be lock-step with the worst kind of liberal bullshit.His daughter is literally insane. She more or less disowned him. I don’t know why Angelina Jolie hates her father, but I’d bet it’s because he is “too intolerant”.Still, I find it weird that he starred in so many degenerate roles in his younger days. Did he have a change of heart as he aged? Was he just doing what he had to do to make a living?

                Whether you approve the depiction of the hillbillies in remote northeastern Georgia–and I can understand it if you don’t–the notion that Deliverance is a terrible movie or that making Clouds feel superior to rural southerners was its purpose is utterly preposterous. From a techical standpoint, Deliverance is one of the greatest films ever made, from the script, to the acting, to the score, and perhaps foremost, the cinematography. The fact that it offends you changes nothing.Furthermore, screenwriter, James Dickey was a politically incorrect Johnny Reb from the outskirts of Atlanta, hardly some Judeo-Puritan, anti-southern Leftist. And there is nothing to suggest filmmaker John Boorman–a Limey–was any sort of flaming Leftist either. Those fellas set out to make the helluva film and succeeded at every level.

                    “the notion that Deliverance is a terrible movie or that making Clouds feel superior to rural southerners was its purpose is utterly preposterous.”  Agree.  Far righters can often be just as touchy about how they’re “depicted” in old movies, as Lefties are about every movie ever.
But in general, yeah, Hollywood sticks it to the white man. Obviously.

        I am late to the parade here, and have only read the first few sentences of Z’s essay. What is this crap about ‘The Searchers’ introducing racism in film? Demonstrably false. Watch ‘No Way Out’ from 1950, with Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier. Now THAT is a movie about racism.I love ‘The Searchers’, but I never caught any message from it. It is true that John Wayne played a man who detested Injuns and wanted to kill Natalie Wood’s character because she was the spawn of racial impurity. He changed his mind though. Or rather, the director John Ford changed his mind. I have watched a ton of John Ford films and never suspected that he gave two shits about ‘racism’. Hell, take a look at ‘My Darling Clementine’, and pay attention to the scene where Wyatt Earp (Henry Fonda) literally kicks a drunk Injun out of town.Another movie that “trangresses the boundaries” concerning race, is Hitchcock’s 1944 ‘Lifeboat’. A motley crew of survivors from a sinking includes a black man, who is quiet, spiritual, and also an ex-pickpocket. A fully fleshed-out black man in a movie. Or check out the classic 1943 film ‘Since You Went Away’, one of Shirley Temple’s last films by the way, which includes Hattie McDaniel in a role far more dignified than the one she is famous for, in ‘Gone With the Wind’.

                Not at all the theme of ‘The Searchers.’  The book is an incredible read, and the movie follows closely the incredible years-long effort of the Wayne character to find his niece.  The enemy is the Comanche, which was also true for other less-warlike indian tribes of the day.
The book was very well-researched and well worth a read.

        I liked Taxi Driver, but I also probably took the opposite message of what the film had intended.  Travis was living in a very culturally blue city and becoming completely alienated from the feckless degenerate people living there.  Think about the characters he meets: other taxi drivers who are just lumpenproles resigned to the reality of their environment, the criminal element that thrives in a left wing city, his love interest as an idealistic brainless white woman, her jew beta white knight coworker, and finally a teenaged whore.The message was probably intended to be about the “authoritarian personality” and how every white guy will eventually turn into a spree killer, but watching it from a DR perspective Travis Bickle did nothing wrong.

                “There are a few actors who play themselves. Christopher Walken, Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery, for instance.”
They’re essentially ‘character actors’ who created star character rolls, because they’re just that unique, naturally likable, and cool.  So many old-school actors were like that.  Not great actors but good enough, and just cool.  Lee Marvin.  George C Scott (great actor, but always SO himself), Robert Mitchum.

            The 3 season ‘Medici’ series, a joint Italian-Brit effort, was marvelous in every respect but one: the (mis)casting of Dustin Hoffman as the Medici patriarch.  Luckily, he is killed off in the first episode.  His inability to act is brought into glaring relief by the skilled work of the rest of the cast.If you like beautiful scenes of Tuscany, and high drama based largely on reality (the assassination attempt on Easter Sunday in the Florence Duomo, for one), give it a gander.

        The degeneracy flood gates opened in the late 60’s… “Summer of Love,” drug culture became ubiquitous, wave #3 of go girl feminazism “insta sluts,”no fault divorce you get the picture, or in this case “the movies.” Some of that was great art, a lot of the music of the period was great as well, more tongue in cheek about the sex and drug references, not in your face like today.That said, you can enjoy those movies, and music in the abstract without living a degenerate life, or being in essence… a scum bag.

        I saw MC a long time ago, well before the DR, properly speaking, had come into existence. And, to be fair, my political antennae were nowhere near as sensitive as they are now. That said, can we say for certain that MC was actually attempting to make a point about America? Isn’t it possible that it was simply the story of a couple of sad and shady ne’er-do-wells struggling to survive in the cesspit known as New York City? Not that I would put it past the filmmaker and screenwriter to produce a pro-heauxmeaux anti-American allegory, mark you, but I’m not certain they did. I should probably watch MC again.

            I didn’t really get a pro-homo vibe out of it. I guess you could say it served the purpose of desensitizing, whether that was intentional or not.
Hollywood’s real pro-homo campaign, in earnest, didn’t really kick off until the late 80s/early 90s

                Midnight Cowboy is the most recent critically acclaimed movie I can think of that equated homosexuality with deceptiveness—with the progressive innovation that the homo deceptions in MC are unintentional/innocent.Ten years later, Cruising *incidentally* did some gay=liar and the media flipped out about it. In 1992, when the same by then archaic “trope” appeared in Basic Instinct, it caused the lesbian equivalent of street riots (a couple fat chicks in traffic). It’s rarely seen since then, very rarely in anything Western, and never in anything respectable.Possible exception: Characters in David Lynch movies are usually characters from other movies, so maybe the Cowboy in Mulholland Dr is the one from Midnight Cowboy, fully adapted to city life. Smart critics correctly identify Lynch as a “fascist” (normal person).

        Midnight Cowboywas sleazy but another from that era possibly even sleazier wasLooking For Mr. Goodbar. But LFMG has a problem, actually two problems. I suspect that’s why it’s so little known today. The problem is that it portrays feminist hedonism and homosexuality in a negative light. You can find it on Youtube last I looked with Bulgarian(?) subtitles. But if you don’t want to feel contaminated, don’t watch.

        Like the Zman, I don’t regret watching MC. But I feel no urge to watch it twice. Perhaps, being a Gen X child of the 70s and 80s, its degeneracy didn’t seem so scandalous to me. I’ve been conditioned.Not long ago I was reading something John Wayne said about how all films should be “family friendly,” which was why he was against the MPAA rating system. Putting aside my thoughts about Wayne, of whom I was never a fan, he did have a point. But you can’t very well start down that road before you quickly arrive at Soviet style films about happy workers.However, there have always been, and evidently always will be, gatekeepers of the film industry, who decide what messages get propagated and which ones don’t. It’s just a question of who the gatekeepers are, and what are their values. AINO was still a white Christian nation when Hollywood began pushing and prodding it to be something else, in the era in which MC and other such “envelope pushing” movies came out. It wasn’t art imitating life.

            Let’s not forget Frank Zappa being outraged in the late 80s because Al Gore’s wife wanted to put warning stickers on his albums containing ridiculous sexual degeneracy.  And his side won!  And they feel virtuous about it to this day.
Imagine the horror that a sticker may have prevented a mother from buying a Zappa album containing songs about homo S&amp;M bondage for her 10 year old.  Our country really dodged a bullet there…

                Zappa was one hell of a paradox: An absolutely brilliant composer and guitarist, a perfectionist and disciplinarian who would not allow his bandmates to indulge in mind-altering substances, but who had just the most base, juvenile sense of humor.
The documentary about his life and career is worth seeing.

                    Concur.  He is a composer and instrumentalist of significance, very unique, but, in my opinion, a bad human being, although quite fascinating and intelligent.I admit that I would have liked to have had long discussions with him about life and music but then I would have exiled him.  Life entails tradeoffs.To anyone who is curious, here is a 3 minute sample of (instrumental) Zappa.  It starts out kind harsh, but in the last minute, I think you can sense his unique vision.  Try to stick with it and perceive the melodic/harmonic intelligence at work.  It’s not pretty, but it is rich:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDl04aFmzoU

                He objected to them being put on other people’s albums. Zappa owned his own record company that sold nothing but his own work—not subject to any proposed regulation—and had recently won the rights to all his own music in a lawsuit against the world’s biggest media company. (Couldn’t happen now.) It wasn’t a self-interested position. Like milquetoast mope John Denver who was equally “outraged,” Zappa was protective of young musicians.
Every late 20th century censorship campaign / media hysteria was the work of leftist feminists. Conservatives, especially conservative Christians, were their useful idiots. As always.

            When Whiteland is formed, tolerance is going to be an issue. Clearly, we cannot allow anti-white Leftists to push their filth down society’s throat as America did. In fact, Leftism in generally will have to be rigorously suppressed. However, there must be some semblance of cultural latitude or what you wind up with is an insipid and dull panorama. America’s approach to culture was fatal, but I hope we can do a bit better than Wayneism, although I do greatly admire the Duke.

            This is ridiculous.  We have a production code, its just the Hollwyoods  production code.  Do you know that in the late 30s and 40s, producers and writers were submitting their scripts and stories to Communist Party USA for vetting?Well, things aren’t much different today.  Look at all the crap Mel gibson went through to get “Passion of the Christ” done.  It made a Billion and should have sparked a slew of religion film copy-cats. It didn’t – because Hollywood refuses to make those kind of movies.Nobody in Hollywood can get a film done that crosses “The party line”.  So its not  “are we going to censor and gatekeep” its just a matter of WHO is doing it.  The production code was too strict in many ways, but it should be adjusted, not gotten rid of.

If money’s tight, see if Ramzpaul has a spare bedroom at the “Wolf’s Lair.”  It would be fun to watch Ramzpaul and occasionally see Z Man stumble around in the background in his robe and morning coffee.

            It is noteworthy that in spite of his outspoken “conservatism,” Voight never truly fell out of favor in Hollywood as some others have. Perhaps temporarily, but he was always back. And recently, after public support for the Orange Man, he is still getting plenty of work. Can you name one other like that? And now today he is full throated for our greatest ally.

        I would a been a wee Filthster when those kind of movies came out. At that age I was a voracious reader but still playing with GI Joe and Johnny West. I would sit down and watch these movies with my shitlib family and wonder what the hell was wrong with them and what they saw in such shows. They’d tell me to shut up and that one day I’d be grown up enough to understand. Here I am, pushing 60 hard… and I still don’t understand. Do people actually DO stuff like that? If so…why?Nowadays those people are everywhere, calling the shots, destroying themselves and those around them… and I still don’t get them. I don’t want too. Life is simple to old stubfarts and retards like me – there’s actions and consequences…and ya can pick your actions but ya can’t necessarily pick your consequences. I look at those shitlib movies and see them as cautionary tales about being foolish with your actions… and people get mad at me. The easy thng to do is be somewhere else when you encounter such people.Dustin Hoffman can go suck a fart.

        However unpleasant, these movies are aesthetically and historically important, as they simultaneously reflect and promote the culture of existential nihilism that defines late empire America.
America probably should have collapsed after the 1970s. We got a 50 year reprieve, thanks to microchip induced prosperity and a wellspring of cultural virtue not yet completely exhausted by the Pill and Diversity.  But the plan was in place, and Hollywood was there to show us what they intended for us.

                You didn’t live during the 1970s . . . stagflation, gas crisis (1973) and (1977), and all the cultural and racial problems of the present, though white flight was possible.  Notice the word flight.  NYC was far worse than even today in terms of crime and trash on the street.  Those 70s movies Z refers to give a flavor for this.  Reagan, for his faults, did change the mood of the country and combined with the subsequent computer revolution, pointed out above, the rot was slowed somewhat, though the offshoring of jobs had begun, with free market Republicans leading the way.  Worse, then came  the Bush-Clinton-Bush years.  That 90% white category was split up into many different tribes by the way, divided along religious and ethnic lines, to say nothing of region and politics.  Most significant, the me first generation was now running the show.

        Saw it when first released.  What I most vividly recall:‘X’ rated movie – no one under 18 admitted – I was not yet 18 – would I be turned away – nerves ablaze.Made it in – anxious to see some…skin.By the end – kind of disappointed in lack thereof.Hoffman as Rico Ratso: “I’m walkin’ here” most memorable line.  Brenda Vacarro was kind of sexy.At that time, hate whitey was not really a thing and the thought of whatever homo’s did was dis-gus-ting.This was pre-aids, gay still meant happy, and a rainbow was something pretty in the sky.Those were much different, simpler times.

        Zman did you hear about this movie Killers of the Flower Moon?  Basically a Dicaprio and Martin Scorcese movie that deems White man stole Native American oil wealth. So White man bad in Oklahoma over 100 years ago is the 2023 focus of Hollywood.  Dances with Wolves was also this way. They volley back between Black man victim to Native American Indian the victim, but White man always bad. Also they have to go back 100 years ago because they have so few stories to use in the current day.

            KOTFM is there to shape the frame every time somebody wants to build a pipeline or drill an oil well on “native land.”
If “native land” is a real thing, then doesn’t that mean there is also “white land”? Somewhere? Doesn’t the existence of one automatically imply the existence of the other?

            Yep, the volley from black, to indian, to illegals, to jews, to arabs, to covid, to vaccines, to ukraine, to taiwan, to trannies, to you name it.The truth about worldy power is this:  divide and conquer.  The rulers want the endless conflict and war.  It solidifies their power and gives them cassus belli to do whatever they want.  Winning or losing wars is besides the point.  They care not if a nuke goes off in the US; they might prefer it.  The point is money and tightening tyrannical power, and maybe killing a lot of the overpopulation while they’re at it.  That is all.

            They also continually go back in time to trot out the Emmitt Till story every few weeks in the NYT.  Didn’t they also just do a movie about poor ol’ dindunuffin Emmitt Till?
Moviemakers could make it extremely easy on themselves in finding material if they focused on Whites-as-victims.  The Jupiter Paulsen Story, The Ethan Liming Story, The Cannon Hinnant Story, the list is endless.

            Dances with wolves was absurd.  The Noble Red man.  Lets skip over the stealing, torturing prisoners, raping captives, treating women as slaves, and the general low-level barbarism.Look, we all want to romanticize the Native Americans.  And we have been doing that for a long time (cf: last of the mohicans published in 1823).  But Dances with Wolves took it to a whole new level.As for Killer moon,  out of all the stories Scorcese could tell, why did he chose this one?  I wont see it because the trailer looked boring and 3.5 hours is too long.  But the obvious antiwhite narrative isn’t my cup of tea either.

        Hey Zman, if you’re looking for new digs might I suggest the Upper Peninsula. Sure we got endless bugs, endless winter, and we’re a couple hundred miles past the edge of the known world, but it does keep the riff-raff out.If I didn’t get my morning dose of rage from the internet (possible only due to a satellite) I’d think the world was a wonderful place, and all the people in it moved here from Mayberry.I’ve lived all over this country, and being a Yooper is the best. I was born under the bridge when my dad worked for Pontiac, moved away when I was 6, and now as I’m nearer the end then the beginning I’ve finally found home.“And the end of all our exploring. Will be to arrive where we started. And know the place for the first time.” (Eliot)

            Herr Man,You’ve just reminded me of a drive through the  UP (which ought to be a peninsula of Wisconsin) during the summer of 1988. There was a big drought all over that year, and much of the forest along US-2 burned furiously. By the time my father, brother, and I passed through, there were huge areas of charred black vertical sticks as far as the eye could see from the highway. At night the glow of fire was visible from the shore of Green Bay near Fox Park on M-35.  (The park is between Escanaba and Menominee.)It’s by the way that Yoopers tend to be mushy and confused folk, like the people of Lewiston, Maine, who are tolerating colonization by Somalians. Yesterday Yoopers are too worried about the Pack, Jesus, cheap beer at the IGA, and other innanities  So the end is basically a foregone conclusion, I’d say, given the truth about Nordic Yoopers, the motives of the ruling class, and the thorough demographic knowledge of the RC’s ambitious managerial hires.“Lewiston, the second largest city in Maine with a population of 37,000, emerged as a major center for African immigration into Maine. The Somali population, which numbers in the thousands, has changed the demographics of the once overwhelmingly white mill city into one of the most diverse in northern New England..”https://apnews.com/article/lewiston-maine-shootings-49da6d06a8b5a15d3b619b3927bc33ff

            It seemed obvious to me, when I first watched MC not very long ago, that he was enthralled by MSM reports of women’s sexual liberation, none of which seemed to be happening in the west Texas town where he was washing dishes at the diner, so he headed off to NYC, where he was led to believe the women were lusty and putting out left and right.

                An interesting bit of trivia about the movie (which I confess to have seen not) is that, Crazy Annie, Joe Buck’s lover in Texas, was played by Jennifer Salt. (Source: Wikipedia) She was the daughter of Waldo Salt, the screenplay writer who adapted the queer novel for…
Producer  (((Jerome Hellman)))
and
Director (((John Schlesinger)))..
From now on, I will refer to that movie and its clueless star as Midnight Cowboygolem.

                His premise wasn’t wrong — i.e., that sex-starved middle-aged and moneyed women might want, er, a little young male company. But such women want it with a bit of class. They don’t just want a roll in the hay — “Wham, bam, thank you, Ma,am.” But class is the one thing he didn’t have, i.e., “cultural capital.” His entrepreneurial project was doomed to failure and in the big city he sank to his natural level — that of a lumpenprole.

        Have never seen it, nor intend to, despite Z’s recommendation. But I do remember seeing the movie posters when it originally came out and reading some of the reviews, which even back were obviously veiled propaganda selling an agenda rather than a cinema critique. I lump this crap in with the blaxploitation movies of the same era. Intentionally demeaning faux storylines that leave the viewer far stupider as the reward for being suckered out of the price of admission. Movies like this are the venereal disease of our culture.

            I watched 30 min of it recently as I wanted to see a film with NYC 60’s footage (that is now 60 years ago). It has some great shots of American places, but soon I realized this film was demoralization and I could not continue watching. It is not even scandalous for 2020’s, but you realize the purpose of films like these was to make me say that it is not that filthy now LOL. It is a degenerate film, but you can find uglier stuff in pronTube, LMAO we are F’ed.Zman is right that if you care about how movies are made it was not a painful film to watch (given our current desensitization). If I had watched it younger I might have identified with the angst of the movie. If you are already unhappy with your life (maybe because your family unit was already broken) this movie could be cathartic. I am only saying this to explain why this was great propaganda, not that I approve of it.I am a son of the 70’s and when I get some crumbs of my family history (they are so broken I don’e get too much information about it) I realize they were victims of the demoralization. Their moral immune system was weak and the church in the 70’s was already in shambles. This movie represents this campaign of uglification of America and for that it should be detested and deleted from memory.

                I am a decade earlier, so I have a foot in both camps. Something broke really badly in the 1960s when I was a boy. There was a resurgence in the 80s. Then what happened? In my family the grandparents born in the 1910s died off and that was the end of the large family gatherings. My parents and their cousins, my aunts/uncles, drifted apart. I didn’t step up because I was caught up in what I thought would be rewarding, lucrative career. So that was that.Anecdote: I remember my father telling me he could never get his grandparents, my great-grandparents, to say much about their lives growing up.

        Speaking of anti-white movies, Martin Scorsese’s latest, 3 1/2 hour! production was reviewed by Aaron Sleazy. It’s been getting critical praise. He was invited to its release in his country. He said he would have walked out after an hour but didn’t want to be rude to his hosts.

            Another “white savior/noble FBI” movie isMississippi Burning.Look, I’m originally from the Magnolia state so I know firsthand all its flaws, but that movie paints it as definitely in the 3rd World category. None of its roads are paved, all of its law enforcement are kluxers, and every black is a passive victim of its reprehensibly oppressive oppression. The truth is quite different. The vast majority of its people are simple, hard-working, non-intellectual, and kind-hearted. In other words, prey for the vultures in Hollywood and the MSM. They also have understandably become somewhat paranoid about outsiders. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe play the noble FBI agents who swoop in and save the passively passive blacks from the local klan chapter.For a long time I was ashamed of my heritage. People — even other Southerners — treated me as though I was from another planet, possibly even from the xenomorph home planet. Finally, I adopted the strategy of positively boasting about my origins (even if I don’t fully endorse this view.) This works much better. One advantage of this strategy is that I immediately know who is a friend and who is an enemy and who is uncertain and I make it my mission to win over the latter.  I’ve talked to people who thinkMississippi Burningis reality. I can tell you without hesitation that’s a lie. Stand tall, Oklahoma!

                The film was crud. There was a much earlier film also set in Ole Miss that you must also have seen — “In the Heat of the Night.” Most of the whites are portrayed as clueless crackers and the one out-of-town black detective single-handedly solves the murder case. These films do harm to the image of Mississippi and the white people living there.

        A film from the 1950’s was a much more subtle slam on “toxic masculinity” and White American male culture::  “Tea and Sympathy” .   The assault began in earnest with “Payton Place” and “The Defiant Ones.”. Then in the Sixties came one of the worst films of all time: “Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner.”

I think art can be challenging, and even offensive, but if it leaves you feeling soul-sucked, it’s not art. Just the opposite, in fact. Easy to identify, but like covid, too many people follow the experts and their trends, even if they have a better judgement.

            For the entirety of history humans made art to inspire civic pride, express standards of beauty, celebrate triumph,  mark important events, or reflect praise back toward a deity/ies.It wasn’t until the late 19th and particularly the 20th Century that the idea of creating any emotion/response became accepted as art.It’s a cheap trick usually committed by a less than talented hack to garner fame or attention. Desecration of venerable societal totems or mores, or simply promoting a gag reflex by the use the fetid displays are its hallmark.The Charlatan will nail a bloody menstrual rag to the wall and chirp about his art being valid because it “inspires strong emotion”. On occasion you will have a talented person lend a touch of skill or artistic nuance to the endeavor… but ultimately it is simply putting a gilded frame around the soiled rag.If one can cause a response of this kind and it can be considered art… then the feces devouring shih tzu we had as a kid was Rembrandt.You recognize art in your DNA. Does the expression land in your heart and chest? Or does what you are ingesting with your senses cause revulsion in your stomach and bowels? You inherently know the answer about what you are consuming.

                Very good post, but I would offer one caveat to your thesis–music. In the realm of music, particularly instrumental music, the elicitation of emotion is one of the mainmost hallmarks of true excellence. Beethoven’s Fifth has no words and therefore no rational content. But the symphony certainly does have a content, and the content is its emotional resonance.

            New Rules for the New Enlightenment: In all things, the polarity shall be reversed.For example, music and/or visual art must be ugly in order to have meaning.  In film and/or literature, he villain is the hero (hence the quaint modern term “anti-hero”).  This includes children’s stories, as illustrated in the play “Wicked”.  Goodness is subjective and power is the only legitimate virtue.  All standards and concepts once accepted as true shall be ridiculed and/or stood on their head.

        In my lifetime, the happiest time of movies was the birth of the blockbuster franchise, which of course ruined movies as an art form ultimately.1975:  JAWS:  a terrifying movie, maybe the scariest ever, but a movie in the end about triumph and overcoming a horrendous threat.1976:  ROCKY:  the greatest underdog story ever; pure heart and inspiration.  And yes, implicitly about a working-class WHITE man (like Rambo).1977:  STAR WARS:  White farmboy is the hero defeating galactic despots that (at the time) could be thought of as the USSR type deal.1978:  SUPERMAN:  Christopher Reeve embodied the best of 50s America in red, blue, and yellow.

                I actually love the sequels (including V), but they are of course not of the caliber of the original.
Did not like 2006 “Rocky Balboa.”  Seemed like bad fan fiction to me.  As for the Creed series. . .pass.

                    I thought the 2006 one was decent, the story was a based on a fight simulation that was done between Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali.
Rocky Vis better than its reputation and has some really good moments with the Mickey character. It’s also a good reminder that had a legit White heavyweight champ from Oklahoma in the 90s in the form of Tommy Morrison, shame the guy couldn’t keep his head on straight.

                        It was Morrison’s dick, not his head, that got him in trouble and he died of AIDS. (He had a comeback of sorts after claiming the diagnosis was wrong, but it wasn’t.)
Not quite big enough to carry off his fighting style, I think.

            The birth of the blockbuster is an interesting thing. Jaws usually gets credited for being the first, but The Godfather (1974) and even The Exorcist (1973) are sometimes nominated for kicking off the blockbuster phenomenon.

                George Lucas is well known as not understanding his own films.  For all his pretendy Left winger bluster, the good guy characters are white, classically-American, archetypes complaining about leviathan government and ruthless totalitarianism.  No gays.  Billy Dee Williams didn’t have a chip on his shoulders.  And nobody sitting around the casting department worrying about “representation”.I like watching Star Wars as a movie about white people saving the galaxy.  I love watching Star Wars because I know George Lucas knows he made a movie he hates and he will go to his grave frustrated that his two biggest achievements – Star Wars and Raiders – repudiate basically everything he professes to believe.

        “He quits his menial job and takes a bus to New York City for reasons that are never explained. He immediately decides to make a living as a male prostitute, targeting middle-aged women.”The reasons seemed clear enough to me — just look at the dead-end job he was doing at that restaurant. And he decided to become, er, a male escort before he even boarded the bus — as he explains to his sceptical black co-worker at the restaurant. I liked the beginning of the film — the soundtrack and the vast expanse of the country as he takes a bus from west Texas to NYC.He’s never good enough to become a competent escort — he lacks the sophistication required. You can see that when he and Rico con their way to replacing the real escort for the agency, “The Perfect Gentleman.” This is NYC, pal, not west Texas.

        I have mixed feelings on “Taxi Driver.”  It’s of course well acted, interesting premise, and iconic and all that.  BUT it pulls a bait-and-switch ultimately.  It takes the real and legitimate fear of urban crime, alienation, and societal degradation and delegitimizes it because the feeling of those feelings is Travis Bickle, who is nuts.
Originally, the Jodie Foster pimp played by Keitel was supposed to black, but Scorsese chickened out.

            Scorsese could have got away with a black pimp at that time — I recall other “blaxploitation” films that had blacks in unsavory roles. “Dolemite” (released in 1975) being one example.

                    You may have a point. While we’re talking about black pimps, let’s also recall the film “Magnum Force” (with Clint Eastwood) made a few years prior. That also had a black pimp, but apparently only having black prostitutes under his wing.

            I also think Taxi Driver is a missed comparison simply by placing it’s seedy nature side by side with Easy Rider.Travis does a good by blasting a pedo pimp and trying to rescue the girl, but his character is written as a nutjob  not so subtly (maybe) implying that only wackos would punish that type of behavior.Also, Travis has natural urges and desires but the society that has molded him led him astray. He’s genuinely confused that the porno theater date is a flop, he’s disgusted by his job/clientele, and he gets a glimpse of what politics really is when he drives Palantine…My two cents anyway…

                Travis is a great character.  He is a confused young man, a simple innocent who is warped and used by society and is slowly able to grasp this fact.
But like you said, it makes the idea of punishing the crime and bad behavior that of a “whack job.”

            Bickle was nuts, but he was also an undoubted hero. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a film whose message was more mixed than Taxi Driver. At any rate, I think we’ve all felt a lot like Travis Bickle from time to time.

        Thank God for ZMan and our other outlets. Check out the utter delusional pap from VHD today. America from 1609 to 1965 was not multi-racial. My God these people are impotent.In the meantime, the same site has taken down a post by Dennis Prager. In Prager’s post he claims that it is the Jew’s God that everyone worships. It is they who created the moral standard that the entire world kneels to. Any calamity that befalls them is evil perpetrated by the dark that seeks to tear down the light of humanity. He ends by explicitly exclaiming that he is more convinced than ever of the Jewish people’s, “chosenness.”And the best “our” guy can muster is a totally falsified history of America as a multi-racial society that was highly successful. I’ve been reading a bunch of posts by Teresa R. Manning as well. She’ll point out that “diversity” is anti-white discrimination than shake her fist that we must be individuals. When is our Dennis Prager and Ben Shapiro going to appear? Answer. They have but on sites like ZBlog. AMGreatness and TAM … … are owned and controlled by and for Prager and Shapiro. VDH is a sniveling coward and a fool.https://amgreatness.com/2023/10/26/premodern-diversity-vs-civilizational-unity/

                Replying to Painter, if you’ll allow me to speak in the Christian dialect:So some would say, ‘well then, is it or is it not God’s Word?I say it is; He gives the searcher example after example of the Deciever’s method:Take a true history,and then rewrite it,casting oneself in the role.  Steal the credit and reassign the blame.Once inured to seeing between the lines, the searcher is then inured to seeing beyond today’s lies and revisions.Thus the Spirit fortifies our armor of truth, rather than casting doubt upon us.There is a force of good and a force of evil; yes, the Maker, the force of good, created what became a force of evil- death, and pain- because He is not some all-powerful arch-magician who can snap his fingers and change the physical constants.The sorrow comes that the Creator must do his best with what He has, with what He has been able to achieve.To claim imperfectability is an ignorant boast of arrogance, that their god- who can only achieve death, and pain, the ruin of a Life he did not make- that their god is above even the Spirit within.Are not spinning galaxies enough?Is that not Power, enough?

Why the very ones who claimed that yet, they tricked even the All-Powerful into a deal He could not break, a stone He could not lift.
Hint: It was not the Creator with whom they made their deal.
Tricked themselves, were they, the arrogant ones?Offered the promise of a throne?

                    At any rate, and at the risk of being heretical, Yahweh’s ethics and Jesus’ ethics ethics aren’t the same. One leads to desolation, the other, to the empty tomb.

                        Jesus never declared a single bit of the law evil. If he fulfilled parts of the law, that’s a completely different thing.On the contrary, Jesus said:“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.”There are no contradictions between Old Testament and New Testament ethics, only an expansion.

Which, I think, is why Jesus said, “It is finished,” before He gave up the ghost.

                John 8:37-45I know you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My word has no place within you. I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”“Abraham is our father,” they replied.“If you were children of Abraham,” said Jesus, “you would do the works of Abraham. But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing. You are doing the works of your father.”“We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.”Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me.Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept My message. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies. But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me!

                        “The rules” never said that God had to continue to bless the Jews even if they abandoned him. Covenants are contracts that have responsibilities on both sides. You don’t get the benefits of the contract if you don’t fulfill your responsibilities under the contract.There are plenty of OT examples where God let the Jews endure suffering for long periods because of their faithlessness.They’re absolutely free to accept Jesus and get back in God’s good graces.All the apostles were Jews who made the right choice.If the Jews he was addressing were following the Devil it’s only speaking the truth to call them out on it.

                        If God can unilaterally change the contract— and accepting Jesus is a change— then it’s not a contract. It’s the stuff of lawsuits in the affairs of men.I’m OK with that because God should be omnipotent, and being omnipotent, he can be capricious from our perspective.  That creates problems, though.I’m convinced of EMJ’s argument that the gospel of John is crucially important. Making God the Logos was the second step (following the Great Commission) in making Christianity a gentile religion. But Logos has to be universal and unchanging— that’s the basis of philosophy and science, isn’t it? Looking for those enduring truths on which one can base knowledge.The way the church went about courting the gentiles, while maintaining continuity with Moses and Abraham, has produced a Gordian Knot.That contradiction has caused crises in the past, and we’re living through the latest one.  The solution, imo and in the past, has been to become more gentile.

            The article starts out with a lie, and proceeds to more.This moral revisionism relates to the Spanish Civil War.From my web notes:“A whole bunch of stuff just made sense right now, like all those desecration of nuns’ remains, the burning of churches, theft of Spanish wealth…This wasn’t really a civil war after all. It was just another extremely bloody jewish culture revolution.”Led by France’s Leon BlumRe the Arianite Goths:“This isn’t the first time. A major pill is collapse of the Visigothic kingdom. Funding or leading rebellions, leading slave trade, helping the Arab armies.… it’s a deep dive most basic on-line historians skirt around. For one cannot speak on the Goths, unless you speak of Jevvs.Never forget the rivalry between Jews and Spain started in the dark ages, because The Visigoths wouldn’t let Jews sell white woman to Arabs, or let them use Christian slaves.There are many books on this, by Jewish historians.”

            “In Prager’s post he claims that it is the Jew’s God that everyone worships.”
This is why I advocate that if you want to worship God, stick a horned helm and eyepatch on him and give him a magic spear and two ravens.  Then you’re free of the Jew crap.

                    The Christian God is pretty much just an adaptation of the European chief god figure (old man with a white beard, shoots lightning bolts) applied to make the demonic blood god of Judaism function in Western culture.  Same as how we have Christmas instead of some crappy Jew holiday.

            70’s Dinkins vibe?  He was mayor in 90-94.  Lindsey, Beame, and Koch (my favorite) during 70’s.  City was seedy as it came out of the hippie era and into the Civil Rights era, but it was never out of control as it was with Dinkins (and last two mayors).  Indeed, the Dinkins era gave rise to two good conservative (for NYC anyway) mayors:  Giuliani and Bloomberg.  Of course, the last “good” mayors came about with a city still half White.  That is now down to 30% or so.  No hope for recovery.

        Like Taxi Driver, which I also hated, Midnight Cowboy is important because of what it represents on the historical timeline. When the robot historians attempt to retrace the steps that led to the collapse of the American experiment, they will no doubt look at the popular entertainment of this period for clues. Within a single generation, America went from the pinnacle of cultural achievement to the world of Midnight Cowboy.Here’s a real question – and conundrum.Does degenerate entertainment like MC or TD or any number of other examples drive degeneracy?  Or are they popular because the degeneracy is already widespread?The default dissident tight position is that such efforts are propaganda designed to drive cultural degeneracy.  Which is hard to argue against.But, otoh, plenty of propaganda falls flat, bombs at the box office with no traction whatsoever.  And what does it say of white people if they are so easily swayed by blatant propaganda?

            For what it’s worth, I’m kind of in the former camp.  I think Hollywood degeneracy creates degeneracy in the wider population.I think the primo example of this is the non-stop profanity we’re subjected to now.  I’ll never forget how much this offended my grandpa.  He actually saw combat up close and personal in WW2 – something he would never talk about – so I’m sure he was well acquainted with profanity.  He always hated though sitting down to watch a movie and hearing all the characters go on and on with the “‘eff this you effing mother effing eff.”I’m convinced that the reason profanity is so casual now is because we’re bombarded by it in movies.  And I don’t even think profanity is somehow natural to people.  When I was younger I worked many a blue-collar job moving furniture, washing dishes, etc. and no one I worked with ever would have thought to go on and on with “effing eff you effer” on the job.

                Concur.  The whole point of profanity, as I understand it, is the expression of sudden, intense feelings.  The ultimate adjective, like nukes, to be used only in dire need, if at all.  One hears f*ck so often now it’s a commonplace, a crutch word.

                Raiders of the Lost ark came out when I was 14 and I thought Karen Allen’s character was so cool that she could drink all the men under the table and at 14 that became my goal and I emulated her for too much of my life.  It wasn’t the only factor obviously but it was definitely A factor. When people ask me why I don’t drink now I just say “I’ve had enough”  because that is the truth.

                    On the contrary, you had too much. It seems obvious to me that your trajectory was fully intended by (((Lawrence Kasdan))), who is usually given credit for writing the screenplay even though the story originated with Lucas and (((Philip Kaufman))).On a related note, see the work of E. Michael Jones for details about the role of the usual suspects in the beverage alcohol business in Poland, esp. before the partitions of the late 1700’s. Jones claims that they had some sort of lock on production or distribution, in addition to the privilege of running a state within a state and the arenda tax farming racket.

                My grandfather, born in 1904, was appalled at TV commercials for feminine products.  And those were the first ones, the ones with gauzy pastel shots of flowers and fields; the ones where it wasn’t quite clear what they were selling.  How could he deal with today’s ads, where flabby shrews talk about rubbing deodorant on their private parts and underboobs?

            I think the key is that societal rectitude is fragile, always and everywhere, and must be consistently maintained, promoted, favored, and exalted (I.e., depicted as an ideal of morality and beauty) in order thrive.Permitting even a small element of denigration or “transgression”—perhaps more accurately termed “desecration”—introduces a poison that leads to the downward, mutually reinforcing cycle of degenerate art inspiring degenerate behavior inspiring even more degenerate art… to Doomsday.The fragility is why great cultures have been homogeneous on the path to their apex, and suspicious of introducing (or even tolerating) alien cultural elements. The visible contrast between natives and resident aliens is enough of a solvent to local folkways that it can begin loosening the strictures of a hard-won successful tradition. To then accord those resident aliens “rights,” privileges, and even priority, is ultimately to devalue the native traditions—to announce that they are worthless—and to demean the very value of being a native.Thanks Dino. Great early comments on this post.

            Good question, where does degeneracy come from. I think material wealth is necessary. Material wealth has the extremely unfortunate effect of sheltering people from the consequences of bad choices. And degeneracy is so dysgenic that it burns itself out in a subsistence environment. So material wealth is the necessary prerequisite. With it being present my guess is many factors including pop culture, mass media, boredom, the survival of spiteful mutants and other factors reinforce each other. Until it becomes necessary to start all over again

        The prototypical Hollywood cowboy movie of the mid 20th century has more to do with Judean fantasies that it does with the actual American west.A town full of peaceful and good people is being terrorized by a small band of criminals.  Until a lone hero appears from no where to save the people of the town from evil. Then, having done so vanishes back into the mists from which he came.It’s pure messiah saving the shtetl fantasy .The real American  west, was settled by hard men, many with experience fighting the civil war. Comfortable with violence and the tools required for its use.  They did not need a lone hero to save them from a few bandits.

            This is a great comment, pregnant with potential for elaboration. It seems to me it describes a lot of our popular culture.
In fact, it makes me wonder whether the inability of Rightists to gain traction in the culture is (at least partly) because the basic story of the salvific individual is not really *our* story. That goes against intuition—rugged individual, Ronald Reagan, and all that—but that’s what makes it such an interesting insight.
Dino, if you’ve written more on this, or can be encouraged to, I would be interested in reading it. Thanks.

                That would be a good observation.  I’ve referred to it (from the book) as “waiting for Superman” any number of times.What we see in MC is the convergence of two societal occurrences/trends:  The removal of the old Hayes movie code (in favor of the new rating system—a joke), and a trend toward the concept of the “anti-hero”.  Heretofore, the “antihero” was used in action movies, i.e., the hero who does good really isn’t that good/virtuous at all, but wins in the end—and of course, “the end justifies the means”.In MC the hero isn’t an action figure, like a real cowboy, but a prostitute in friendship with a con-man.  The entire movie is in essence a feminine story-line where friendship (albeit via homo-eroticism) outweighs all the bad shit these two guys inflict on the society.It is a (technically) good movie when seen as such, but the story line and “hero’s” are just another data point in our society’s race to the bottom.

                    Just so. And not all that esoteric either: Superman is an alien of a superior species, disguised as a human and working in media – like all superheroes. The fact that he’s wearing a spandex playsuit in garish colors is purely incidental.

            Yes. Perfect! The entire project from the first voyage across the Atlantic into the unknown was a civilizational effort. It was hard men, from the aristocratic elite to the last man woman and child settler, it was a great people who were determined, intelligent and hardened.
This is why when they tear down Columbus, they are tearing down the entire civilization that was required to fund, engineer, plan and undertake voyage after voyage after voyage.

                    Stevie Wonder wanted to move to Ghana. Probably because he couldn’t see what a shithole country it was. However, once he visited, he could smell it and decided to stay living in the racist US instead.

            Original “Magnificent Seven” was believable in that it was about Mexicans terrorized by cartels (although the cartels freeing the captured gunslingers was a huge plot hole). Remake with Denzel Washington was awful: a bunch of hard-bitten, Civil War veteran miners in the mountains would’ve put up with that sh*t?

            I think the ‘High Plains Drifter’ type movies were supposed to represent people being attacked during pogroms. In the real old west, everyone had a gun and the townspeople would make short work of a band of armed criminals.

            Agree with you however I think a great movie in that mold wasShane. Shane is a mysterious stranger who rides in and saves the day. He is a reformed gunfighter faced with the moral dilemma that the only way finally to defeat the evil is to meet violence with violence.

                Certainly, but Shane never went rogue.  He was a virtuous hero defending friends/family against evil.  Shane gave the bad guys a fair match/chance in a gunfight—certainly more than any of them gave the innocent farmer they killed.Interesting memory of the book.  The use of a firearm is defended and was never resorted to until the ultimate provocation of murder of the innocent needed to be addressed.You know the book was *required* reading in my Humanities intro class as a Freshman.  Of course, the book was very short, sort of a novella and took little more than an evening to read.  Of course the nation was a “lighter shade of pale” in those heady days.  😉

                    I’m glad you mentioned that dimension. Shane was a man of high standards who didn’t play dirty. He won fair and square. That’s one of the things I like most about it. Of course, this is a question we struggle with today. Conservatives have lost every battle of the last fifty years because they played “by the rules.”
Let’s remember that Shane was a fictional character who embodies the best of heritage American conduct but the real world is a lot messier, a lot more ambiguous in its ethical certainties..

            Along those lines I remember reading an article by someone declaring thatHigh Noonwas a terrible slur on Americans because of the cowardice of the townspeople forcing the sheriff to stand alone, and I thought and still think he made a good argument.

Do you have any example of a Yiddish play or novel with that plot?
Mid-century sounds like “Shane”. The director/author was German but not so far as I know Jewish. Feel free to enlighten me,

        Semi-related: I recently watched the 1964 French movie “L’ Homme de Rio” (That Man From Rio) with Belmondo. I used to love that movie when I was a kid, but now all I could see was the propaganda. There was a scene in a Brazilian favela full of poor black people. It was portrayed as a place that was safe for a lonely young White woman, because the inhabitants were all magical happy black people listening to cheery music and dancing and giving helpful tips. The main villain was white, of course.

        Midnight Cowboy seems like an awful movie. I am glad that I never watched it.
Btw, the movie was directed by John Schlesinger. I am sure he didn’t hate himself, but he definitely hated Whites.

            I tried to watch midnight cowboy twice and I couldn’t get past the first 10 minutes. I guess it’s just not my kind of movie.
