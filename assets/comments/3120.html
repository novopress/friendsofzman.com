        UPDATE 2014-10-31:  At the WaPo web site today you can view an iPhone video Attkisson recorded of someone remotely accessing her laptop and deleting parts of a document she was working on for CBS, her employer at the time, on Benghazi I think it was.  A brief view of the keyboard and also the audio clip indicate she was not touching the keyboard, as you watch the cursor race across the screen and selectively delete parts of her document.  She had no control of her laptop and was able to stop the cyberattack only by disconnecting her machine from the WiFi network.  This came at the time the White House Press office was actively lobbying CBS to kill her coverage of the Benghazi coverup by the Obama administration.   The WH plumbers busy at work?  I think so…

        I believe her account. The current administration was also spying on James Rosen, and who knows who else. Gobsmacker is right: few people are masters of their machines. And those who ARE, are in a position to use that to their advantage. Five years ago my brother, who works in computer networking, took control of my computer (with my consent), to help me solve a particularly difficult computer issue. My point in recounting this is that he isn’t a hacker and doesn’t have the advanced skillset necessary to “spy” on someone’s computer without their knowledge, yet he accessed my computer remotely. But there are people who do have these skills, and some of them work for our government. Doesn’t sound so kooky to me.

        Never underestimate the ability of an alphabet agency to pour enormous resources into the small fish.  Anything and everything is justified if someone thinks one knows something they do not.Some even have black helicopters follow.  Usually, that is just the reaction to a harmless mistake.  Breeds paranoia among the confused.More game theory, factored in.  Unknown unknowns, and such.That is Roswell.  Shoot down your own damned weather balloon, blame it on aliens.  Then not.  Black Budget Cartoons.Just because “they” do not know what they are doing does not mean they are not busy trying.  Success is not defined  as goal oriented when deep ops are involved.

        “There are no hidden places in your operating system. There are places where code can be hidden away, but not documents.”Please.  Stop.  This is unnecessary.  You needn’t take every statement she makes literally just to poke fun at her.  There are “dark” places, like the OS dynamic libraries for one example, where documents could be hidden and where most users never go.  It’s true of Windows, it’s equally true of Apple OS X.  Few people are masters of their machines.  You probably use the TV set in your living room constantly.  If it broke down, would you know how to go inside it to fix it?  Do you know how to read complex wiring diagrams?  I doubt it.  Moreover, if I were to take everything you write on this blog literally, I would never stop laughing.  Give the broad a break.

That’s the point. She’s saying the sorts of things computer hackers on TV say, not the sort of things said in real life. I’ll allow for the possibility that her “three letter agency guy” is shining her on, but I also suspect she may be a kook.

        How unsophisticated is a fifty-three year old woman be who has lived the life inside the Beltway for years to finally discover that Obummer and her own profession are morally and intellectually corrupt?

        “a sophisticated entity that used commercial, nonattributable spyware that’s proprietary to a government agency: either the CIA, FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency.”
How can commercial non-attributable spyware be proprietary to a government agency?  I reckon that’s what’s known as a non sequitur.
