        What the GOPe and cucks don’t get is that this isn’t just a political spat that will fade with time or be patched up with sweet talk and some trinkets.  This is a divorce.  The spouse who worked to pay the bills and provide sustenance has walked out after he found her screwing his worst enemy.  It’s over.  Finished.

        “without necessarily making it more serious or sober than its Bircher-era antecedents.”Never mind the fact that the Right-wing populists were, what’s the word?, oh yeah, RIGHT, and the Conservative elite were wrong, both then and now. Douthat forgets that modern Conservative Inc. heroes like Reagan and Goldwater were products of the populist right, that the Republican Establishment hated both, and that they only became heroes in retrospect. Had Douthat been an adult in 1980, he’d be supporting John Anderson, and writing long, thoughtful essays about how Reagan’s crew were destroying the party of Rockefeller and Nixon.Any “conservative” who supports the managerial state in its present form is a traitor, full stop. That should be obvious even to idiots like Douthat. Of course, it probably is…

            I think the GOP establishment hated Reagan more in ’76 than they hate Trump now.  They were absolutely furious at him and blamed him their general election loss (ignoring their mediocre candidate who stood for nothing).

                Never underestimate the devotion people have to the entities that create their paycheck. If I went Godwin with the idea, it would explain a lot of what happened. “Just following orders” and all.

        Let me introduce mr douthat to a word he is unfamiliar with — constituency.   As in he and his fellow cucks don’t have one.  Ross, and Jonah, and the other chinless wonders in the cuckocracy lead exactly no one.  They are my enemy and I will attempt to hurt them any way I can…

        Busy today so not much time to write anything thoughtful. In the same vein as the column from Douchehat, check out this drivel from Peter Weiner over at NRO:http://www.nationalreview.com/article/441320/republican-party-after-donald-trump-questions-rebuildingThe level of delusion among the professional conservative class defies belief. Having been resoundingly rejected by the base of their party they now believe they hold moral authority to redefine conservatism after Trump. Do these guys wear Superman pajamas to bed??Separately, I’ve been reviewing the polling data on Real Clear Politics and now believe that the Electoral Vote count is:Trump: 266Clinton: 218Undecided: 54 (CO, NM, MN, WI, PA)If Trump wins any one of the undecided states he wins the election.You’ll know the election was rigged if Trump loses NC.

        OT:  Comey just announced in a letter to Congress that the FBI is reopening the Clinton probe.  The usual paid-for Clinton toadies and sycophants (Sargent, Krugman, Yglesias, Eichenwald) are having a meltdown that is glorious to see:

        “Hey, horribly misguided and foolish Trump supporters!  Sure, some mistakes were made, but really the Beltway establishment is not that bad, at least when compared to that icky Hitler Trump. I mean, look what’s it’s done for me – and I’m a fully vetted and approved voice of dissent!  And if you just give us another chance we promise to listen to you more, really we do.  And then we’ll tell you what’s good for you, because, let’s be honest, you proto-fascist Brietbart readers just can’t think for yourselves, and lack that je ne sais quoi that I like to refer to as intellectual respectability.  I know that sounds terribly condescending, but you know it’s true.  Because, as we all know, you need us more than we need you. Yes, this is some tough love, but it’s because deep down all us GOPe pjyama boys of the beltway really care.”Your best friend ever,Ross

        I’ve felt this for awhile, but the political realignment seems to be coalescing around the Official Government Party, which is the State-approved party that if you vote for you will not be targeted, and which is borderless and unprincipled, and (for lack of a better term) an American party which is mildly isolationist, mildly protectionist, very independent minded, and which doesn’t just mistrust government, it really rather despises the Government Party that they now realize despises them.

        The highlighted portions are stunning for their lack of self-awareness. That would describe most of us at one time, would it not? If I were paid six figures to think otherwise I may never have swallowed the red pill. For me, a five figure man, the most important moment in “Witness” is when Whitaker Chambers  announces to his wife that are going to leave the winning side to join the losing side. I had no awareness forty years ago how prophetic his understanding was.

        John Derbyshire recently made some insightful comments about how–for roughly half of Jews–it’s always 1890 and the Cossacks are always coming. While those imagining Trump to be a strongman are just having these Jewish vapors, it’s no coincidence that the zeitgeist is exactly the sort that elevates strongmen.
And if the vote is rigged this time, perhaps all the paranoia will be justified after all…

                So who killed that 6 million? The NAZIS? Or those who allowed the NAZIS to proceed? FDR could have ended WWII in 1943, with a total defeat of the NAZIS by  German  anti-NAZIS. That he didn’t, was testament to his enthrallment with Stalin and the need to totally destroy Germany for Stalin’s benefit. So how many American men died for FDR’s infatuation with Stalin? Let alone the vast bulk of those 6 million Jews. They died for Stalin as well.

        Douthat sounds like a heroine addict who is a component of the right wing of cultural marxism, who might have just enough of a lack of cognitive dissonance he is having an inkling how irrelevant he is to a disenfranchised plurality numbering in the millions. (Who I might add have guns and pitchforks. And maybe it might be dawning on him he is an enabler of the Big Lies, no matter how he couches he and his kinds cunning treachery to the base of bitter clingers. Because to put it in simple terms, when you con people who believed, and serve them up as suckers to be spit on for a few pieces of silver as chattel to the corruptocrats, well, your nothing but a fucking traitor of the worst kind no matter how high falutin’ your parsing.It’s no wonder there is an Alt-Right. It is the entire zeitgeist of deplorables, ungovernables, the dirt people that Douthat and his fellow cucks can not swallow. Like them or hate them, or despise them, we exist. We ain’t unicorns, we do not drink the koolaid, we didn’t grow from magic beans, and we did make all that and more, made no matter what flavor the chumps use to hide their rice bowls, dissimulations and lies.

        I don’t read Sailer much, but I think that you are being too humble and Douthat was writing to refute you and possibly Codevilla. That he could not come up with anything that met the feasible, suitable, acceptable tests (just whining and fantasy, really), shows that Conservativism, Inc. is intellectually defeated.  What’s next?

            I have a large enough readership now that it is possible, but I suspect most of these guys are so concerned with coloring outside the lines they avoid anything that is heretical. I can tell that some of them read Sailer. That’s because they will repeat him verbatim on occasion and he tends to phrase things in odd ways so it is easy to tell when he is being pirated.I do think I got the word “Cankles” into the bloodstream. I was using that one for Clinton a long time ago in comment sections. If famous people start using my Cloud People/Dirt People riff then I’ll know I’m reaching the beautiful people.

        This is when I start to understand why the Lefties sent the intellectuals to the camp. They wanted them to have to deal with real people for a change. I know it makes them feel SO superior to the dirt people, but really, we just aren’t as stupid as they like to think. And we seem to have longer memories. We remember how they treated the Tea Party. I’ve heard more than one Trump supporter mention this guy:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thad_Cochran.And Paul Ryan is a hack. The only reason people like Ross exist is so that Democrats can point them out as “real” Republicans.

            Ryan is bisexual.  Won’t even commit to one side of the plate, or the other.  Anyway, The lefties are the ones sent to the camps/firing squads/etc.  These are the natural bitchers and complainers in a society; the Jonahs and Davids and Matties.   Once they have served to put the monsters in power, they are *always* eliminated first.  Look how the North Vietnamese commies lured the southern commies to their doom, during Tet?   Look how one group of commies slaughtered another group of commies, in 1930’s Spain?    This shit is hard wired; AKA a feature.

            The lack of actual logic and reasoning among the so-called leftist (and cucked repub) intellectuals is symptomatic of the idiocracy institutionalized in so-called ‘higher education”.As you note: a huge contingent of Trumps support is coming from repub voters who have not voted in decades- white male baby boomers in the trades, middle management, business owners who actually received some of the last decent educations available. And our memories and faculties are quite good.
