        Gotta feel a little(very little)sorry for Gabbard.   She belongs to the party of the Stepford Bitches and the Beta Male.    Last night’s SOTU speech made it apparent to anyone with an IQ greater than room temperature that the ‘Rat Party is now the Communist Party USA and its members are society’s defectives, losers, and the insane.

        There’s no such thing as “anti-semitism.”  It’s a made-up wizard-word, a magic spell designed to pre-empt and derail rational analysis.  In the same way, there is no such thing as “anti-tuberculosis” as a moral valence, in the sense of ascribing a negative, pathologically evil moral valence to the simple wish to not die of tuberculosis.
If your house was being constantly bombarded by artillery shells and you complained to me about it, and my response was to point and shriek, and yell “You’re just a slimy anti-artillerist!”, well… what good would that do?  What truth is there in that?

            Yeah, sorry Z-Man but I instinctively question anyone who seriously uses the terms “anti-Semite” or “anti-semitism.”
They are words used to control and bully. Personally, I don’t like getting pushed around so Jews can take their magic words and shove it up their asses.

                Very similar to the purpose of the “racism” charge used by blacks which is understandable when you consider who invented the term “racism” and who basically ran the NAACP for years. When blacks actually ran the NAACP, they nearly went broke and had to be bailed out.

                    Southern elites called plantation owners invented the term racism.  They were quite brutal in its application.

            “It’s a made-up wizard-word, a magic spell designed to pre-empt and derail rational analysis.”
Indeed. A Palestinian of my acquaintance once said to me, “If I oppose Israeli ‘settlements’ then I am called an ‘anti-Semite’. But *I* as an Arab *am* a Semite. So being against settlers makes me against myself?”

            Exactly.
It’s like how they throw around homophobe and islamophobe and “racism”, and everybody then runs around like an idiot trying to atone for their sins.
I don’t irrationally fear homosexuals – I don’t like them – there’s a difference.
I don’t irrationally fear Muslims.  I don’t like their belief system and I tend to avoid things that blow up unexpectedly,  so I keep my distance.  Neither of these are an irrational fear.

                There are three different definitions of a “bigot” that I know of:1)  Someone practicing sociology without a license;2)  Someone refusing to kowtow to minority demands; and3)  Someone winning an argument with a liberal.

        For the last couple of years, Tulsi Gabbard has been the one Democrat who I thought could defeat Trump in 2020.  Besides being good-looking, she comes across as very likeable and sensible.  Since she served in Iraq, her stance against war carries weight, compared to some weird peacenik.  I hope she stays in the race, so more of the public can see what (((they’re))) doing to this attractive and appealing woman and it becomes more obvious who’s running things.

            I don’t know much about her and I’m strongly opposed to women in politics, but my general impression of her is she comes across as reasonable. Reasonableness is an under appreciated quality, but it counts for a lot in the mass media age. The rest of the field are the sort who frighten the horses.
My guess is she will get a total media blackout. The exception will be if she says anything blasphemous.

                If Gabbard was better on immigration and the Second Amendment, I might consider voting for her, if only because of how much she infuriates the Deep State types. The whole “Defend Israel – Russia Bad!” business is BS anyway – Israel has the best military in the Middle East plus nukes and doesn’t need defending from anyone, and relations between Putin and Netanyahu are actually pretty good. As usual, the Neocons are living in a dream world.

                    As simple as it seems, Gabbard goes in the same category as Biden.  I think she actually likes people and it comes across.  The current crop thinks shrieking and seething anger is somehow going to attract a majority of voters.  I’ve met Biden a couple times and seen him work crowds up close and it shows.  Met Hillary once at a CGI meeting and she made a frozen iguana seem warm.

                        Oh, Biden likes people. Maybe too much, if they are young, female and vulnerable.I peg Biden as a dunce: literally a little mentally slow. I think everything he says is scripted except when he makes one of his famous “gaffes” by not realizing he shouldn’t speak the truth. I always picture his handlers cringing backstage and frantically signaling him to shut up.The weird grabby pedo vibe he gives off is disturbing. It’s like he doesn’t understand, as the rest of the depraved perverts in power do, that you have to keep that stuff discreet — in his addled brain he probably thinks he is being discreet.

                            Like I said, in person, he is an old fashioned ward politician.  Probably not the brightest, but if you shake hands endlessly and look people in the eye and seem genuinely interested it will carry you a long way.  Against the rest of the current crop is very similar to when I’ve personally seen Bill and Hillary together, with Bill in the room, Hillary looks worse.  No idea how this will all shake out, but won’t be boring.

                She’s been on Tucker Carlson’s show a few times the last couple of years.  It’s obvious that Tucker likes her.  She’s the voice of reason when she’s talking about the Middle East wars.  Her biggest flaw is that she seems to favor high immigration.

                        Yeah, that and guns are a deal-breaker for me, but she’s not obviously insane, and she looks like a normal, somewhat feminine woman, so that makes her stand out among Democrats. She doesn’t have that deranged, inhuman killbot “White Hetero Men Must DIE!” stare that so many female dems have. So naturally, she doesn’t stand a chance.

                    I suspect her opinions on a lot of things, like immigration, are not well thought out. She just accepts the conventional thinking. It is in the areas where she has some experience that she seems to arrive at heretical positions. It will be interesting to see if she radicalizes on other issues this year. Her only way forward is to stake out turf not occupied by the gaggle of hens now running for the nomination.
Imagine an anti-immigration, anti-war protectionist running as a democrat. Welcome to the 1970’s.

                I feel compelled to write a unicorn comment: As soon as the Dem establishment starting trashing Gabbard, it seemed a great idea for the President to reach across party lines for a new VP for 2020. I have great respect for VP Pence, but it would continue to drive establishment politicians out of their minds. Dems would be seen publicly trying to destroy a brave, intelligent, independent woman. Just a dream sequence, but the first female President would follow Trump. And she is a stud.

                I agree.  It is ridiculous.  We live in a socialist society and have done so since at least the 1930s.  It’s about more and more socialism that benefits other people, not oneself.
A hilarious example is when a constitutional conservative complains about socialized  medicine.  Uhh, Medicare and Medicaid are socialized medicine.  How many people want to abolish these programs  at the federal level and then reestablish them at the state, which would be constitutional.  These programs have grown through the years.  Anyone complaining?

            I’d call it outright pro-semitic conditioning. When I was back in grade school, in the early 60s, they had us dancing the Hava Nagilah, which is like the Israeli national dance, to the accompaniment of that klezmer-like faux clarinet they play. I can still remember the melody. This was in the lily-white Pacific Northwest, where we hardly even knew what a Jew was. We were literally dancing to their tune, and have been ever since. Yet people who point this out are “aluminum hat wearing conspiracy theorists” that we have to distance ourselves from?

                    Huh, I assumed it was just me because I went to a heavily Jewish middle and high school in NJ.
Interestingly, our band teacher was a strong Christian, and we did a lot of overtly religious Christian pieces in band and choir and nobody appeared to think anything of it. There didn’t seem to be much religious friction in my school  But I was in a non-religious phase during high school and some of it could have flown over my head.

The diversity while not always antisemitic have no particular concern for Israel and as the Boomers sand older Gen X die off the edifice they created will go with them.WW2 is more than three generations in the past nowI also suspect that that White  Gen Z kids while again not antisemitic also will be aware of the inherent corruption in the system vis a vis our foreign policy and may well want what’s left of the resources for themselves.if things go nuts in the 2030’s as many think they will. Israel had best be able to stand on its own as the US may not even exists after that and even if it does, will be in no shape to help anyone.

        Bad enough that Jewish interests have enormous influence over American foreign policy.  But even worse is the effort to essentially outlaw the BDS (boycott, sanction, divest) movement within the United States.  Even if one is vaguely pro-Israel, the effort to shut down dissenting voices and repeal portions of the First Amendment is frightening.  Chateau Heartiste has suggested the use of the term “counter-Semite” to describe people who have no objection to Jews as Jews, but who oppose the effect that Jews have on both foreign and domestic public policies.

            The question should be honestly asked of those Jews in our countries who devote so much time and effort to Israel. If you love them so much, why aren’t you living there? Why are your sons not serving in the IDF?
If you don’t being attacked for ‘dual loyalties’, why not give up the second passport?
An honest response can’t be expected from them, but others will not be OK with this hypocrisy. It’s not 1948 anymore with poor refugees. It’s 2019 where Israel is now richer than Japan per capita.

                    I think Israel’s relationship with the Arab world would change significantly if the US scaled back its support to just economic aid. For Arabs, Israel is the cat’s paw for the West, specifically the US. Their hatred of the Jews is more about America than the Jews.
That said, that horse has left the barn. We will be in the Middle East until we are bankrupt.

                        It would be somewhat easier to just redirect the Israeli aid to Jordan, which could still be sold as protecting them. The dollars would also go farther in terms of personnel. We don’t give Israel economic aid anymore, but Egypt does receive aid. Said aid would be better spent in Lebanon, paying refugees to go back to Syria. But AIPAC would screech about Hezbollah.

                        From the viewpoint of Zionist counter-semites (currently at one) ending Israel’s status as an American protectorate–both militarily and economically– would greatly strengthen Israel. Without this connection select Arab provocations would necessarily result in select Arab annihilation so the players  will become much more realistic. Economically, the Hebrews would not have American money to subsidize their traditional socialism, and for their survival be left to press forward with the great advantages they do have over their neighbors-especially over their neighbors–in business, wealth creation,  and intelligence. The Hebrews should be made too occupied with running the middle-east, which they are in part doing already, to run American policy, especially when there is none. If Rome could once run the world Israel can run the middle-east. Good luck to them, and good riddance.

Ever heard that quote ( I think it might have been Hemenway) : ” How did you go bankrupt? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly ” ?
That’s where we are.  We’re actually bankrupt.  But extend and pretend is in play and because there’s a lot of ruin in a nation and still a lot of money to counterfeit and shit to steal – we haven’t gotten to the all of a sudden point yet.

                        I disagree Zman on this one.
Jew hatred is codified in the Koran.  Until Islam changes – and there are Muslims who are pro-Israel and positively disposed towards it – the threat to Israel will not abate.  But this is a Herculean task.

        Well, after a 20 year hiatus of not voting because there is no sense to it, I went out and voted for Trump.Ok Apathy Central, I am back. How about that Superbowl!I knew we wouldn’t just vote ourselves out of this but my God, we are back to arguing for legal immigration good, illegal bad again?Also I am just mind numbed on this incessant Holocaust drivel. Were there no other noble survivors in that war that ended even beforeI was born? I will leave the jew stuff alone, what’s the point anyways.I think Trump, if he ever really cared, sees the train wreck in the Democratic party and figures he can phone the next one in, or just go backto his fun business adventures.

            The harder-edged sites posit “Holocaustianity,” i.e., the left making the Holocaust the center of a new politically-correct, Parenthesees-controlled religion, in which the Holocaust is the central event, much like the crucifixion in Christianity.  I laughed at it as over the top at the time, but it stuck in my mind, and the evidence accumulates…

            This was obvious when Trump groveled before AIPAC before he even got the nomination. I still voted for him because Clinton did the same the very next night and because if Trump had lost, anyone trying to resurrect the issues of immigration, bad trade deals and endless wars would be dismissed with the words “those issues were settled in the 2016 election”. The fix was obvious with his cabinet nominations, almost every on of which seemed to go wrong and finally, the cruise missile attack on Syria.I warned others not to fall in love with this guy and can at least say that I never donated to his campaign or bought on of his stupid hats.

        I said a couple of years back that we had reached “Peak Jew” in the United States.For at least 50 years, elite Jews had carte blanche to undermine gentile whites, push multi-everything onto the West and promote Israel. There was zero push-back. Indeed, many upper middle-class gentile whites welcomed the moral superiority that it offered them over working-class whites.(In their defense, influential Jews believed that what they were doing was “Good for the Jews.” I live by the creed of “Is It good for European Americans” so I don’t blame them for trying. I would destroy their people and culture if I thought that it would help my people and culture. It’s just business. Nothing personal – though I think with a lot of Jews, it, in fact, is personal.)But facts on the ground have changed, and this new environment isn’t as conducive to Jews as the old America. To a degree, Jews are a victim of their own success. Gentile Whites, who overwhelmingly saw Jews as one of their own, are increasingly marginalized and demonized for being white. Blacks and browns of all flavors are taking over the Dem party, which will soon have permanent control over the White House, the House of Reps and, while this will take longer, the Supreme Court.The group most easily influenced and bullied by Jews – gentile whites – is losing power. The groups that recognize Jews as either “white” or specifically as Jews are gaining power. Blacks and browns want to punish and dispossess whites, Jew or gentile.Elite Jews miscalculated. They thought that they would could join the Coalition of the Fringes. They thought that their money and their Jewish Holocaust schtick would work as well on tribal blacks and browns as it worked on high social trust gentile whites.I don’t think Jews realized just how important is the fact that they look white. When gentile whites see a Jew on TV, our minds instinctively think that he or she is one of us. Why would he steer us wrong? (Maybe that wasn’t the case before 1950, but since then, the overwhelming majority of whites don’t see Jews as anything other than another white guy or gal.)When a black or brown sees a Jew talking, they instinctively see a member of another tribe – whether generic white or specifically a Jew – and don’t trust him.Jews were (and still are) trusted by gentile whites. Jews are not trusted by blacks and browns. Jews will never have the same influence over a people don’t trust them as they do over a people who do trust them. I don’t care how much money and verbal dexterity you have.Jews now must deal with a marginalized and ever so slightly race aware gentile whites on one side and hostile blacks and browns on the other. Compare that to even 20 years ago when they had pliant conservative whites in the GOP and a Dem Party that they along with their Good White sidekicks controlled.

            The former youtube personality, Frame Games, is a Jew who recognized that nobody in the world will treat Jews better than white people.  Frame Games disappeared several months ago, because he feared getting doxxed, but he produced some great content about the importance of a clear white majority.  For Jews being so smart, their goal of a multiracial nation is sheer stupidity.

            Zmans post  are a huge new potential red pill for me (whom thought i was thoroughly red-pilled). Zman is suggesting that a command and control structure exists and that a genuine conspiracy is in play, if i read him correctly.   I guess i always never believed that more than three guys could get together and keep their mouths shut to pull off a conspiracy.  Yet i have come to believe that the communist were a semi-successful conspiracy…   So one could say that israel controls US foreign policy, but I would translate it to- the jewish lobby is highly influential. Ahem, maybe there are really 20 mustache twirling villains running this show.  It would make sense(and be understandable that the jewish holocaust might have produced a super-hardcore nucleus of Jews that could pull it off.  (Side note: I’ve decided to believe D. Irvings conclusion on the holocaust- that the gas chambers were largely propaganda but 4-6 million jews were transported to poland, shot and buried in trenches. so the jews did take a horrific hit).  Lest you might think that this is difference that lacks a distinction (the results are the same after all) it might matter.  Maybe taking 20 pieces of the board (deportation, not killing even in minecraft) could turn the ship around.  Clearly i need to think on this as i am barely coherent.

So i identify people who seem honest in the face of persecution and decide to trust them.  Anyways if they can suppress gaschambers built after the fact- they can supress a few bones drug in by a dog  in eastern poland.

                        Irving folded.
I can’t blame him, seeing what they did to him, but that’s the truth of it. He changed his opinion on the Holocaust, but he didn’t provide any reason for his change of mind, no new evidence.
They can supress a few bones drug in by a dog in eastern poland.
Six million bodies is not ‘a few bones’, and they suppress forensic archaeology by declaring extermination camps Holy Ground for Hebrews – even touching them would be anudda Shoah.

I only note that Irving changed his mind on the scale of the Holocaust without providing any new evidence to explain why.
So they are suppressing the existence of mass graves, and thus Irving could be on the money?
I suppose he could.
But suppressing evidence of the Holocaust is hardly their usual MO.
Mind you, I have no doubt that the Nazis murdered tens of thousands of Jews, but six million? That’s quite a claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

                            Your question prompted my memory.  I think he found a german officer letters appalled that his work jews were killed using bullets and dumped in a bulldozer dug trench.  The germans requisitioned efficient machinguns and lots of bullets for east poland after front moved on ; and he found records where  about 4-6 mill jews were taken (the germans called it sluiced) to eastern poland.  Finally 6 million people is alot but they would fit into cube measuring ~230 ft on each side; not that big (this is if one assumes the average person occupies 2 sq ft of volume – conservative).  we have mine pits out west that could stash the world population easily.  Tried to find source material from irving, but couldn’t- sorry. Confident my memory of irving claims is correct.  Surprised they no more widely distributed.

                                He already knew that Jews were being machinegunned, when he appeared before Justice Gray in Irving vs. Lipstadt in 2000. This was never a contentious issue for Holocaust revisionists, the documentation is abundant from letters and diaries and it’s even mentioned in a few official SS reports.Irving also recognized that people  were gassed – using gas vans – experimentally, since execution details sapped troop morale. He described the gas van operation in some detail and, pressed by the defense, offered a guesstimate of 1,500-2,000 gas van victims, until the gas operations were stopped for practical reasons.He refused to give any  number for East Front massacres, but he recognized that those happened too, of course.And while six million dead bodies might not amount to much on the scale of the universe, it’s not something you easily hide, especially since we ostensibly know exactly where the graves are. If they wanted, they could easily get a shitton of forensic evidence, shut the Holocaust deniers up for good.Instead they persecute decrepit old men with Mickey Mouse charges. Recently,Germany had another kangaroo trialwhere a guard was accused of accessory to the murder ofmore than 100 Polish prisoners gassed in June 1944 and “probablyseveral hundred” Jews killed from August to December 1944 as part of the Nazis’ so-called “Final Solution”.“Several” hundred. “Probably”. They can’t even be arsed to produce an actual number.

                                    he found records where about 4-6 mill jews were taken (the germans called it sluiced) to eastern poland.I would be interested in a link showing those numbers, but the Osttransporten – the Eastern Transports – is not a contentious issue for Holocaust revisionists either.What Irving, and others, believe, is that those Jews were being transported to Poland in preparation to being expelled to rump Russia after the war was won.Furthermore, Irving believes that the Polish massacres started because while victory eluded Germany, the Nazis kept sending Jews to Eastern Poland, and the concentration camps were overflowing, so the SS took it upon themselves to simply murder new arrivals.

                                        And just to clarify: there are four main contentions in mainstream Holocaust revisionism:
1) The number murdered Jews is less than six million.
2) There was no centrally organized program for murdering Jews, it happened ad hoc.
3)  There were no homicidal gas chambers.
4) Hitler himself did not know that large numbers of Jews were being murdered.
Subscribing to any of these beliefs can get you prison time in several European countries.

                Sidvic, what matters is not what I believe, but what they believe.
Since examining the counter claims, I’ve come to the conclusion that they’re getting revenge for something they made up, whether cynically or sincerely.
Revenge for a setback in a war they started, even.
I don’t matter, the why doesn’t matter, the evidence doesn’t matter.
What matters is that the revenge continues.
I’d be perfectly happy to ignore any Other’s beliefs if he stays in his own yard.  All I want is the attacks and blood libel to stop.

                    Point well taken, but…  I think it important to try (at least) to understand how things actually work .  It might not effect ability to predict future but is important for strategy.  For instance, are we dealing with 20 super-villains or a loose confederation of 10,000 minor villains?  The mayhem caused might be identical.  But your strategy for countering them effectively may hinge on this understanding.  Hope you see this alzaebo, fun talking with smart ppl.  Willing to bet you gifted academic.   I coin my concept sid’s law in case it unique haha.

            The evidence that J3ws and Israel greatly influence foreign policy is necessarily indirect because they don’t publically announce their motivations.  Some evidence:
1.	Trump’s admission that we are staying in Syria to protect Israel.2.	Z’s recounting of Tucker’s recounting of Bill Kristol confession.3.	Many of the largest donors to both parties say that the protection of Israel is one of their highest priorities.  Sheldon Adelson, one of the largest donors to the GOP, is a good example when he said Trump will be a “tremendous president when it comes to the safety and security of Israel.”

            Pat Buchanan will second your emotion, as will Joe Sobran.  The Tribe succeeded in crippling Buchanan for life, and nearly buried Sobran, too.  Do not take them lightly.  There is a reason that God Himself called them “Stiff-necked.”  (He did not add “jackwads.” but He could have….)By the way, committed “pro-Semites” are notably and viciously anti-Catholic.  If you listen to Levin for long enough, you’ll notice that is is VERY quick to lash out at the Church and its people, unless one of them calls him to fellate Israel.  No surprise; the Church is merely tolerated by Israel’s authorities;, who know that if they display their real sentiments support for Israel in the USA would drop over dead.

                The hard-core left cares naught for anything to do with religion, but supports both Judaism and Catholicism because they hold the “right” political position on the immigration invasion (more, faster, shut up you xenophobic racist!).
It was a mistake to admit more than a handful of Jews to the United States, and we’re now seeing the same is true of Catholics who want the country overrun with colonists because lots of them are Catholic and they’ll keep the church doors open and the collection plates full.

                Yes, when P Buchanan was  criticized for saying -names like murphy and adams had to fight the war while rosen and wolfowitz was pushing it- was a moment that the matrix flickered for me.  I didn’t understand what was being implied; i didn’t even know jewish names back then.  So i looked into it… ahhhh.  Now if i hear of someone being shitty or i think looks jewish I look em up on wiki to see if they are jewish.  My jewdar has developed considerable.  I supect that many jewish people look up people that do admirable things to see if they are in the tribe.  So bias selection is danger with this approach

That doesn’t really work anymore. Whereas five years ago, Jewish activists would brigade up and mass-edit Wikipedia to make every famous person in history a Jew, today you almost never see their religious heritage mentioned.

                “There is a reason that God Himself called them “Stiff-necked.” (He did not add “jackwads.” but He could have….)”Just like on your blog, similar to our host, you do not offer the proper context.  As it is figuratively used, both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, the word means “stubborn,” “untractable,” “not to be led.” The derivation of the idea was entirely familiar to the Jews, with whom the ox was the most useful and common of domestic animals. It was especially used for such agricultural purposes as harrowing and plowing (Judges 14:18; 1 Corinthians 9:9).The plow was usually drawn by two oxen. As the plowman required but one hand to guide the plow, he carried in the other an “ox-goad.” This was a light pole, shod with an iron spike. With this he would prick the oxen upon the hind legs to increase their speed, and upon the neck to turn, or to keep a straight course when deviating. If an ox was hard to control or stubborn, it was “hard of neck,” or stiff-necked. Hence, the figure was used in the Scriptures to express the stubborn, untractable spirit of a people not responsive to the guiding of their God (Exodus 32:9; 33:3; Deuteronomy 9:6; 2 Chronicles 36:13; Jeremiah 17:23, etc.). See also the New Testament where sklerotrachelos, is so translated (Acts 7:51), “Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit.”.As far as “our political class is being more concerned with Israel than America”, indeed, most normies do not believe it, nor should they be duped into thinking otherwise.

            Like most Americans, I think, I have little interest in Israel or modern ME politics. There’s a dreary sameness to it. Once you learn the players, there’s nothing else to know. It’s why I rarely write about the place. Yet, the first e-mail I got from a reader was about Israel. Some of the first comments were about Israel.
It’s one of those things. You may not be interested in Israel, but Israel is interested in you.
Now, I have to attend to these men in black suits waiting by my car….

                Funny thing.  One of my kids is over in the sandbox for an engineering internship right now.  Before he left, we watched “Lawrence of Arabia”.  Told him the funny thing is, you’re gonna find that except for changes in technology, nothing else there is any different.  We’ve talked a couple times when within cell range and he’s astonished that I was absolutely correct.  Years ago read Mango’s excellent, though long, bio of Ataturk.  What cemented his embrace of secularism was the experience as young Ottoman officer of endlessly peeling the same tribal and theologic miscreants off one another in the Levant that we see fighting today.

                        I’ve been warned – but never outright banned.  I have gotten other people banned though by drawing them in and then poking them until they lost their shit.Edit:  I have to take back the “never banned” comment.  Kim D’Toit banned me at least a couple of times (many moons ago) – when I got all over his shit as he was defending the US getting involved in Mideast wars.  His reading of the Constitution and intent of the Founders was something I just couldn’t stand without giving him shit for it.  He came off as a neocon (this was early 2000’s) – when being a neocon was all the rage in the right wing. Even back then I could see that wasn’t a good path to start following.

            Captain Mike (and ZMan):  “They” have taken down web sites in the recent past that do not “conform” to the progressive, globalist, neocon, NWO, (insert your flavor here) agenda(s).  The website case that I know about is run by former CIA agent Michael Scheuer and for years his web site was “non-intervention(dot)com”.  Scheuer has been, for years, sick to the back teeth with the perfidious influence of the numerous pro Israeli lobby(s) in the United States.   In July of 2018 Go Daddy “vanished” Scheuer’s web site.   It took Scheuer about a month to find a new “conduit” (whatever Go Daddy type organizations are actually named) for his postings but he did and his new website is now “non-intervention2(dot)com”.It is not uncommon for Scheuer to include historically supported insights about Israeli meddling in the various ways they have done and continue to do, although he does not do so in everyone of his posts.  Might be a website that you and others here would find interesting.For details about the “takedown” go to YouTube and after the usual address “stuff” that ends with “youtube(dot)com forward slash” type in “watch?v=jTw_DuakYZQ”.  I just did this and the YT is still posted.  The YT channel is  “JohnFredericksShow” and it is dated July 31, 2018.For a sample of Scheuer’s thoughts about the neocons and Israeli lobby(s) you can look at his most recent posting dated February 3, 2019 entitled, “Damn it, Mr. Trump, recall that neocons are deadly foes of America First”.

        Most Americans are not going to wake up to the pathology that is the federal government until times get tough and real hardship returns to daily life. Too many of us are now afflicted with “The Comfort First Imperative” because modern life in the US is very comfortable for most people. This means that whining will always take priority over tangible action. No one is going to go “yellow vest” over endless war until they feel the consequences in the first person. Hint, Macron is scared and it may be time to get the fat ass off the sofa.

        Its interesting. The Jews feel less and less obligated to conceal their power as awareness of that power grows. Its as if they are saying to us “yeah youre onto us. So lets drop the pretenses. We do run show, and there is nothing you can do about it. Now obey, or else”What this does show is that Jewish moral authority is rotting. And as as it rots, they fall back on naked power. Heres the thing tho…moral authority always decays first, with physical power following behind. I predict that the Jewish Raj will be over by the 2070’s. The south asians will likely take over as the head of the bioleninist coalition as “fellow people of colour”. But they will not be as skilled at it, nor do they have the same kind of solidarity. Their ascendancy will be short.Of course its too late to save our culture, but the inevitable decline of jewish power will create opportunities in the decades to come.

            I believe the raj will end too, probably around 2050, mainly due to interbreeding.  The smartest set of Jews are almost all married to Asians or anglos.  I predict the future elite will be more Asian in character and less ethnocentric.  Politics will start to look more like Singapore or Brazil.  We’ll have this weird amalgam elite, Anglo Asian Jewish hybrid

        It’s an unfortunate but true fact, so long-ingrained that it probably makes no sense to apportion guilt or blame over the matter, as it’s now probably more a matter of unthinking habit than malicious deceit, but still, it’s the truth…Jews as a people tell themselves a false and self-serving, fake historiography about themselves, which in some cases is a mere matter of naive folk-belief, but which in many, many other cases is deliberately weaponized against host populations in order to excuse and normalize what would otherwise be seen by any sane, neutral, clear-eyed observer as being hostile, malignant, parasitical, outright vicious behavior.Exhibit A of course is the so-called “Holocaust”.  No sane person denies that during the Second World War there existed a mass persecution of Jewish people in areas controlled by the Nazi regime.  Jews want us to believe this persecution arose by magic, that the German people all woke up one morning and collectively decided to be “anti-Semitic”.  No historical context is accounted for — not the Jewish-Bolshevik bloodbath in Russia, where Jews in the space of only twenty years murdered, starved, tortured and enslaved more European Christians than there were Jews killed in all the “pogroms” of the previous 2,000 years combined.  Not the 1919 Jewish-supported attempted communist coup in Germany, which if successful could reasonably have led to Bolshevik-Jewish levels of slaughter.  Not the Versailles/Balfour betrayal, not the economic and cultural Jewish warfare against the German people during the Weimar era.  None of this enumeration is meant to justify the Jewish persecution, merely to expose the false historiography, the ways that a people decontextualizes itself, and comes to lie to itself and others.  In order to extort wealth and political power to this day.We see this again in the Jewish false-historiographical mewling about Jewish “suffering” while “in exile” in European lands.  The reality is that Jews were slave-traders, usurers and tax extortionists, who leveraged their insular culture of literacy to exploit and abuse a population of unlettered indigenous farmers and laborers among whom they dwelt (and whom they sneered at and despised).  They were not “in exile” in any meaningful sense — and if they felt so, they were always free to migrate to the welcoming lands of the Muslims, to whom they eagerly sold White women and children as rape-toys.  But somehow they didn’t leave.  Like the Talmud says, “Location, location, location.”The point is that the Jews lie to themselves, and in doing so, lie to others as well — to the vast and incalculable detriment of the societies which they infest.(Pages of illustrations).

            I was once invited to attend a service at a synagogue. Although a lot of the ritual was strange to me, I didn’t find anything objectionable about it. Possibly some of the congregation (I don’t know the Jewish term) found it helpful in their search for God, as much as Christians might get some benefit from their own ceremonies.But then came the rabbi’s sermon (again, I don’t know if that is the correct terminology). What an unbelievable collection of persecution anecdotes, including of course the Holocaust! I can’t help feeling that Jews have so internalized paranoia that it’s like a toy stuffed animal they have to cuddle to feel safe. Except they never feel safe. If they have to live side by side with the goyim, the least they can do is try to undercut the goy culture to reduce the perceived threat.It’s sad. I’ve had Jewish friends and known Jews that I liked. They have made contributions to our lives. Jews often care about things that are important to me and not to many other Americans, like classical music and real (not Holocaust) museums. If only their politics weren’t so pathological, I’d welcome them. But they aren’t, and I can’t.

        According to opensecrets.org the top 25 individual contributors during the 2016 campaign contributed over $610 million. 15 of them were Jews, and they contributed  over $429 million, or 70%. The numbers for 2018 were $556 million and $417 million, or 75%. Some of these Jews (Adelson, Singer, etc.) are Republican donors, but I doubt any of them (or for that matter, any of the non-Jewish big donors) are even mildly opposed to US policy w.r.t. Israel. Follow the money. Trump could go his own way due to his wealth (though he has familial “complications”), but the vast majority of Congresscritters need that money, “the mother’s milk of politics,” as a pol once said…

            True, Jews control a huge portion of the money distributed to politicians and that gives them huge control over politicians of any color or religion.
That said, it’s one thing to have control over a people who look like you, think like you, have a similar culture to yours and, generally, like you (gentile whites). It’s quite another thing to forcibly control a people who are of a different race/tribe (and know it), think very differently from you, have a very different culture (and religion that matters to them) from you and, generally, hate you.

                When “our guy” said the our mission in Syria is to protect Israel and then the Senate passed S.1 (i.e., the first, and presumably what they consider the most important, legislation to be taken up by the new Senate)  the ‘Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act of 2019,&#x27;” I would say we can get a good idea of the priorities in Washington by reading it.The bill “calls upon the Administration to certify that conditions have been met for the enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS before initiating any significant withdrawal of United States forces from Syria or Afghanistan,” i.e., instructs the President that the forever wars are forever.Israel is named 75 times in the text of the bill. (The United States, i.e., the nation from whom the bill ostensibly serves, ekes out the victory with 94 mentions…)One more tidbit: Public Law 106–280 used to specify the annual amount of military aide to Israel to be “equal to the amount…for the preceding fiscal year plus $60,000,000.” S.1 changed this to “not less than $3,300,000,000.” In other words, the clause that specified the ceiling became a clause that specifies the floor.I feel wonderful knowing the Congress has the interests of “people like me” as their top priority…

        As the ZioCons slither across the aisle, we should be pounding this wedge into the left 24/7 without ever using the J-word.
In the enemy camp there is a population of young people with views on foreign policy similar to the Paulists, and since they are not going to move our way, our goal should be to push them towards the DSA.
Personally, I’ve found that referring to the “racist, apartheid Israeli theocracy” seems to work best.

        Tucker Carlson gets a lot of mention as of late by many of the websites I frequent (including this one).  I’m careful to begin praising anyone anymore.  In my mind he has two directions he can go:  he will turn into Ann Coulter OR he will turn into Paul Ryan.  Or maybe instead of Ryan it is more fair to say he turns into Rand Paul, a sellout.  One thing i know, he likely won’t stay “in place”.

            Carlson has been a paleocon for most of his life. Not officially, but certainly he has tipped that way on almost all issues. I think like a lot of us, he was shocked by what happen in the Bush years and disgusted by how the Republicans behaved in the Obama years. The problem with the paleocons is they were, at heart, reformers, not revolutionaries. They thought they could work within the system to enact the sorts of changes they desired. I suspect Carlson, in private, now says we need a revolution from the top, in order to avoid a revolution from below.

After the Anarcho-Leftist assault on Tucker’s home and family, you are spot-on.  Having said that, it is time for Tucker to come right out and say it on his show.  He has a chance to become a leader if he has the stomach for it.

                    I’ve come to believe that someone very brave AND above reproach for alot of people will have to lay it out (in reasonable, conciliatory terms) for it to get discussed and gain traction.  The pope? Trump? that’s the problem.  Hard to think of who it might be.  Especially since they took the father of DNA, J watson, down.

                But who at the top are willing to start this revolution. I thought maybe Trump, but he went into office completely surrounded by enemies and has done nothing to change this. All we have on our side are bloggers and podcasters. They appeal only to the below. This is probably why you end so many columns with ‘this will not end well’.

                Carlson is a bit more “Kirk” than “Burke,”–and Burke is the original paleocon; Kirk lent an Episcopalian twist, which accounts for Carlson’s place.
Real paleocons readily concede that neither the USA nor any other country will ever enact nor live by the changes paleocons want and think are best policy/practice.  If Carlson thinks otherwise, he’s a dreamer.

        “Anti-Semites, of course, have always made this charge, but usually without much proof.

            “Hating jews” of course means not happily being Tikkun Olamed into ground dirt and scattered to the four winds.
Luckily God sent his only Son to let those who would listen know rejection of Tikkun Olam would now be loving in His eyes.  Loving towards jews, towards gentiles and towards all of creation.

        I’ve been a conspiracist probably since I’ve been engaged with politics starting sometime in grade school. We used to have this illusion that if people were “woken up” that change would be demanded and happen. But that didn’t happen, and it had a lot to do with personal dislike for those promoting such theories.Its not fun, but we have to hold ourselves accountable. Conservatives at large in the present day bought the  lies of the last three decades of war. It’s not surprising that we are so hated. Collective guilt is real whether we like it or not. That’s what we have to wake up to. Rioting in college towns and shooting the elderly is not a solution, it always makes this much worse.

        Z Man;One way of combatting the Cloud Folk ‘Doctrine of Endless War’ is to highlight it’s destructive economic stupidity for all Americans but the Davoisie.  How dumb is it to be World Cop and not get paid for it_?‘Reverse/perverse Imperialism’ as I liked to call it is yet another host-killing parasitic innovation to thank the Clintons for (besides selling our defense technology to the Chicoms in exchange for campaign contributions).  In the bad old days, imperialism was using military force to take over other countries’ cash flow.  Under Clinton I, they used our military to take over other countries’ welfare case loads, most likely so that their fellow elite’s mid-wit grifters could get high paying NGO jobs.I don’t think Israel had much to do with Clinton I’s ‘Defense Policy as Social Work’ initiatives since they were mostly not in the Mid-East.  Haiti featured prominently as I recall.

        I’ve often wondered, and I’m sure I’ll be flagged in Tel Aviv for saying this, about Sheldon Adelson in particular, who owns a casino empire in Las Vegas and Macau.  These GOP candidates make a bee-line for his office to load up before they run.  As we all know, money is fungible.  Especially cash.  A casino is a powerful tool to move money, it’s very bank like.  I wonder how much money Israeli citizens are losing at his baccarat tables, if you know what I mean.  I could be wrong, but it’s beyond logical to assume that.  I wonder if Israelis have terrible luck there, just can’t get on a winning streak.The beauty of it is that you don’t even rely on middle men.  Just wealthy Israelis on vacation, having a good time, losing money, even being comped in high roller suites.

            Adelson’s success in the casino business was making Vegas into a business convention destination. Laundering by the Chinese via Macau and Singapore would probably be orders of magnitude larger. Ironically Adelson is suspected in Israel of making illegal donations to Likud.
The Israelis pushing money around in US politics are mostly dual-citizens with the US, or dual-citizens with Russia. So on paper it isn’t “foreign money”.
There are known cases where Jewish charity was used for money laundering, but most of the donorism vis-a-vis Israel is just the Occam’s Razor that Jews are willing to write the checks.

                Vegas was a convention town long before Adelson.  He added to it, but he didn’t make it what it is. No one writes checks just to write checks.  I highly doubt all the funding is from Adelson himself.  That’s what I’m saying, and I wouldn’t be surprised that some of that money makes it back to Israeli politicians.  Money is a far more effective weapon than any artillery shell, and it would be perfectly natural for a country such as Israel to do what it’s doing.  I don’t blame them.

        I think part of the reason for this is that everyone in elite American circles is close to some Jew, either as a colleague or quite often as a subordinate in some capacity.  You also encounter the form of crypsis where the spouse of a Jewish person takes on the entire set of opinions of the standard Jewish american(it happens this way much more than the reverse, although there are exceptions).People want their own lives to run smoothly so they refrain from criticism of Israel and Jewish influence.  You don’t want to upset your Jewish friends(especially not bosses and donors!) on account of people in the Middle East you will never encounter.  If I were not in the particular situation I am in, I would be singing “bomb bomb bomb Iran” whenever I was in earshot of a human!

            That’s because Jews recognize themselves as a people, want that people and culture to survive and are willing to fight for it. Gentile whites lost that along the way somewhere, so we’re sitting ducks for anyone willing to band together and sacrifice for a larger cause.
Jews were just the first group to take advantage of white’s loss of self, but other groups are following in their footsteps, albeit more clumsily.

        Isreal is an outsized beneficiary of the conditioning if the normie masses, but its when viewed through the lens of Progress, she is far from alone in the displacement of ‘interests’ both personal and national.I reckon that its the former that should be the focus of any rebellion. I.e. how can zion be called out when we can’t even acknowledge the war against founding stock white christian culture on our own soil?I won’t deny the money, power, and influence of this minority, but the disease is much bigger. Da joos wear the badge; they are at the top of the victim heirarchy.Attack the heirarchy, the value system, the architecture, not who takes the lions share of its spoils.Attempting to take down this power structre head on won’t work if we aren’t even allowed to advocate for our own people.And thats the rub: Its illegal to advocate for white heritage christian culture. Yet people yearn to express their altruism. So they will find a way.The evangelicals have codified this. As have most christcuck sects.

        What amazes me about certain evangelicals, not all of them by any means, is that they truly believe for the end of the world to come about (the return of Christ) that the State of Israel has to exist, as the Book of Revelation describes.  Suddenly a religion that’s supposed to be timeless and stateless becomes tied to time and place.  They won’t kill off Christianity, but huge numbers of millennials are rejecting this outright, and current Evangelical enclaves are being turned into atheist wastelands in a very short amount of time.  This also affects the politics of the region (see Ted Cruz fighting for his life, Mexicans only play a part, yes a large one).If your religion is dying, you can thank errant theologians who connect it to time and place, which kills off religion again and again.

        “…the phrase “Kremlin controlled” or “Putin Stooge” is code for anti-Semite. Anytime you hear the usual suspects linking an enemy with Russia, they are speaking from tribal interests, not Americans ones.”
Anybody who has read anything about East-European Jewish history would know that the Jews of historical Poland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth_(1569%E2%80%931648)andhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising, had a lot more problems in Ukraine and with Ukrainians than in Russia or with Russians.

        Maybe it came from being schooled my old Realpolitik’ers, but have always been of the mind that nations have interests, period.  Interests will create some strange bedfellows, but there is nothing anti-Semitic about pointing out that our and Israel’s interests may converge or diverge at different times.  On the other hand grew up with a great aunt who survived 5 years in slave labor camps and a great uncle that liberated several Dachau sub camps–I will always have a degree of sympathy for watching out for ones own interests.

            My heart bleeds. Did your grandaddy liberate Auschwitz, too? The so-called Holocaust is ancient history to me. Why it has to be the center of the discussion even now is just more proof that Jews have a wildly disproportionate amount of power in the West. I can’t question immigration, homosexualism, wars for Israel, or anything else tearing the US apart without getting called a “Nazi.” Excuse me if I’m sick of Holocaustianity.

            I think it was Paul Gottfried who remarked that pale of settlement Jews seem to have a paranoid hostility to majority society that magnifies the normal tribal behavior. Germans Jews who came to America in the 19th century largely melted into the population. The Russian Jews who arrived in the 20th maintained a hostile separatism.
I don’t know if that’s true, but it does seem that the really nutty Jews are from eastern Europe.

                I was doing a lecture on Eastern Europe and it seems that obsessive nationalism is a common cultural(perhaps genetic) feature of Eastern Europe.  Notice the messianic national identitities for example in Poland that have withstood centuries of occupation and conquest.  I had the thought that Ostjuden ethnocentric behavior may be a sub case of the wider trend, augmented by their other peculiarities.

        Writing as a Zionist Jew… (and donning my asbestos underwear):1. I truly wish that, over some period of time not to exceed ten years, Israel would be completely weaned off of American aid.  This is because the road goes two ways; yes, Israel does wield a lot of influence… but the aid comes with its own strings.  As someone who would like to see Israel as an independent country, truly independent but an ally not client state, aid needs to decrease and finally be ended.2. This is not to say that Israel is not an ally; but it’s an ally.  If I, as an American, want to see the best interests of where I live served, I must remember that nations have interests, not friends.  But common interests, as I see Israel and America having, can make for strong alliances.  Certainly, given the Islamist threat vs. Israel as opposed to the open-legs acceptance of Islam by Western Europe, I’d sooner see Israel as an ally rather than Germany.  Though here’s hoping that the German (and French, and Swedish, etc.) people remember their warrior roots and not only push the Islamists out, but put Merkel’s and Macron’s (etc.) heads on pikes as a reminder to the next 10 generations what the price of civilizational treason is.3. A good friend of mine, also a Zionist Jew, lauded the withdrawal from Syria on his blog.  He is a US military vet to boot.4. My personal view corresponds well with #3.  Assad is a monster, no doubt, but his eyes are focused on THIS world.  The Islamists, on the next.  Given the choice between two scummy alternatives, I’ll take the one where influence is possible.5. More broadly I’d like to see America’s role as the global policeman ramped down.  I’m tired of seeing billions of tax dollars spent to defend countries like Germany, France, etc., who use their “peace dividend” not just to ramp up their economies while we pay for their defense, but slam us repeatedly at the US and block us around the world.Western Civilization is juggling priceless eggs in shifting gravity.  The Islamists are, once again, on the move – having taken a century or two off from 1400 years of expansionism.  Russia, while not strictly communist, is certainly not a friend – though, oddly, it – as a primarily white nation – has much to offer as a common-enemy-in-Islam ally.  Which is, BTW, why I believe there is so much anti-Russia agitprop out there, especially vis a vis Trump: the Left is in common cause with Islam and, thus, wants to interrupt a possible military alliance against Islam with the Russians.China, too, is a threat.  And the population growth of Africa, combined with the squishy-to-nonexistent defense of Europe by France et al poses a significant demographic threat.  As does America’s southern border.Civilizations rise and fall.  The single biggest threat to Western Civilization is not Islam, or communism, or whatever.  It’s the lack of confidence in ourselves, and in particular the disdain our young have for the very civilization in which they live.THIS is where the attention needs to be.

            This is most exceedingly well said.
Too many points to get into despite it being a clear and concise statement. (At least while I’m stealing a moment to respond while between presentations at the conference I’m presently attending.)
I would say on a serious note that if the majority of Jews in the US in particular and the West in general shared your perspective there would be far less “anti-Semitism” of the sort in prior comments here. On a light hearted note, bonus points for the Mote in God’s Eye reference.

                We exist.  At least here in America we’re a minority, but we do exist.I was talking with a friend at Shul and he’d gone to minyan (evening prayers) and said there are more of us than you’d think.  Still, as I said, a minority…The problem is that so many JINOs have put their dopamine tikkun olam addiction above their Judaism – for while Judaism does say “love the stranger as yourself” from what I’ve read the “stranger” is already living among you, and comporting to your society’s rules.  NOTHING I’ve ever seen, nor any persons I know have seen, call for the deliberate importation of “strangers” – whose track record is dubious at best – just to show you are hospitable.  Indeed, one of the greatest Rabbis, Rabbi Akiva, is quoted in the Talmud as saying that while helping others is important, YOUR LIFE takes precedence.  Extending that, I would argue that the life, health, and continuance of the nation in which WE are strangers, and the civilization in which we live, takes precedence over importing those who openly desire its destruction.At the risk of shameless self-promotion, I strongly suspect you will like this piece I wrote on my blog:http://redpilljew.blogspot.com/2018/04/an-open-letter-to-my-fellow-american.htmlAnd please do poke around in general.  I defy you to find things that would make you think I’m one of those who want populations replaced.

        The appealing thing about conspiracy theories is that they’re so *neat*. Every problem, in one area or in *every* area, can be easily explained with one explanation. And if there’s a flaw in the theory, well, that’s all just part of the conspiracy.What’s interesting here is that Z-Man acknowledges causes for these things other than the Jooooz. (Sorry, “Israel.”) Gabbard’s problem was clearly that she stood up for Catholics and against teh gays (and blasted two senators, including one of her own), for which she has grovelled. But nah, must be “Israel.”And sure, support for Israel by Americans has roots in certain values, whether religious or geopolitical or whatever- as he says. But it’s so much easier to blame nefarious Jewish money.Israel took the pullout from Syria with a resigned shrug. It’s not like the US presence was preventing attacks on Israel. “Well, we’re not happy, but we can take care of ourselves,” Netanyahu said. But why take him at his word? Who knows what he said in the Elders of Zion meeting? Sharon *opposed* the invasion of Iraq. Israel likes stable Arab dictators. Bill Kristol is a moron who is less pro-Israel than a utopian invade-the-world-because-deep-in-every-Arab-is-a-Jeffersonian-democrat-trying-to-get-out type. But sure, believe him over the friggin’ Prime Minister of Israel.As the Democrats get more “intersectional” and less pro-Israel, we’ll see if people keep peddling this theory. Probably so, because conspiracy theories are never proven wrong.

        “…Anti-Semites, of course, have always made this charge, but usually without much proof…”There’s massive, massive amounts of proof but it would take an encyclopedia  book to recount. Here’s one of the most blatant. On 9-11 building 7 fell the same speed as a rock dropped in air for around 108 feet. This is not possible unless the structure holding up building 7 is the EXACT same density as that holding up a rock dropped in air. Only air. No building columns, no concrete and steel, no sheet rock, nothing. Well we all know the building wasn’t floating in the air before it fell. Fire couldn’t have done this. You didn’t see fires boil away all the structure to where it was the density of air. The only way this could happen was that the structure was removed or demoed out from under it. The Jews control all the major media in this country and they say…nothing. They can surely see this, being so smart they tell us, as I, a not so smart, can.The end result of this attack on the US by the Jews is we are fighting wars for them in the middle east and have taken out Saddam and Qaddafi.If that’s not control than I don’t know what is and it’s done right in front of our noses. The average Jew knows about this and says nothing. There are maybe 5???10??? Jews that have publicly come out against this Jewish attack. If Jews are not willing to control their more radical, crazed bunch in their group then it’s only reasonable to include them all together with the radicals.The end result of Jews not willing to condemn the worst of their bunch is that they eventually get kicked out of every where they go in any numbers. It seems this is the best way to deal with them as any country that does so immediately becomes a much better place to live.I’m anti-Jew because of what they have done. It goes far deeper than just 9-11 and if Whites are to survive in the USA Jews will eventually have to be deported.The Jews appear to be a tribe of psychopaths. I’m certainly not saying every Jew is but there seems to be no distinguishing difference between a tribe of psychopaths moving into your country and a tribe of Jews. Their behavior on the large scale is equivalent. So even if they’re not all psychopaths there’s not enough normal Jews or the normal ones refuse to act to counter the Spaths.

        I will likely support the Hindu love goddess in the primary and vote for her in the general, if by any deal chance she gets the nomination.
Trump was the first nominee who addressed domestic issues I cared about. Prior to Trump walking down the escalator, I just picked in the general election the candidate who was least likely to get us into a new war.
Now that Trump is acting as a fill in for Jeb Bush, I don’t care if he wins re-election unless he is more anti war than the Democrat.

        “That’s the issue with the theory that Israel controls American foreign policy. It would be a lot easier to dismiss the claims if they were not true.”The problem with the theory is that its not so much Israel that’s doing the influencing as much as it is neoconservative Jews in leadership positions. Those two are not quite the same thing. I’d bet that if you took a list of what Israel would actually like to get done and what the neoconservatives think the Israelis should do, that US policy follows the second rather than the first.“They will forgive him for reversing course on Syria, because they share his general sensibilities on defending Israel.”I wonder how much of that reversal is based on Israel itself and how much of it is a concession to Trump’s own advisors and more hawkish elements in the Pentagon. I’ve been listening to the “wars for Israel” argument for years and the thing is that nothing we do in the Middle East actually seems designed to help Israel. The Iraq war threw most of the field to the Iranians, almost slipped an Islamist government into Egypt, brought the Russian army into an area the Israelis had free reign over before and turned Syria from the quietest front Israel had into a war zone. Its also never been explained to me exactly why Israel would prefer a sea of hostile small states and militias that they’d have to spend manpower and resources they don’t have over centralized states when they’ve never historically had a problem with coming to an arrangement with Arab dictators. Not to mention that if the Israelis were actually controlling US foreign policy, you’d think they’d get issues they are actually interested in done as opposed to what neoconservatives seem to think the Israelis in their head would like to get done.

            Sadly, no.  You’d think the Israelis would not be comfortable with the chaos and violence the Neocons are spreading all around them.  That would be true if the Neocons/Israelis just wanted a status quo peace and stability.  But they don’t, at least not before they genocide the Palestinians. To accomplish that will require a certain amount of regional disorder.

        I am ambivalent to the plight of “da jooos” but am supportive of Israel for the same reason I support the UK and Japan: they all serve as an unsinkable aircraft carrier for projection of American hegemony in their respective regions. If the political climate there, or in any of the aforementioned nation states, happened to change to the point they are of no further use to US foreign policy, I would not care if they get turned into a glass parking lot.

        Israel does not “control” US foreign policy in the ME, but it certainly influences it.The USA has had troops in S.Korea since 1950; does this mean the S.Koreans control US policy in that region?The USA has bases/sailors/marines in Japan since 1945; does that mean Japan controls US policy there?And of course, the USA is the biggest member of NATO; an organization that defends Europe from the 20 year dead USSR; does that mean that the Euros control US policy there?Oh, and let’s not forget about the zillion other US military bases scattered about the globe, like in Iceland. Yep, those nasty, scheming Icelandics.And recently , the USA has maintained a very small military presence in some of the Baltic nations. Yep, right along the border of Russia.Those sneaking Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians; what SOBs.I have no problem that the US helps Israel; at least they don’t hate our guts (as do the Arabs, Iranians, Turks, and probably the Europeans ), but it does bug me – a lot – that despite Israels world class scientists and hi-tech capability, they act like they are defenseless without a few billion $$$ of our tax money.The USA needs to start cutting back on $$$ to them if only to force them to pony up more of their own resources for their defense.Iran is indeed a big threat because they are owned and operated by religious fanatics; a Shia version of ISIS. They will gladly condemn their ENTIRE populace to be incinerated by US and/or Israeli nukes targeted at them in response to the Iranians launching on either the USA or Israel.  An Iranian mullah would welcome his nuclear powered trip to a  heavenly whore-house.If not for the Iranian threat – a threat dismissed by the geniuses in the US intelligence community as mostly non-existent (you know, the same intelligence folks that knew all about 9-11, Saddam’s WMDs, and predicted the fall of the USSR about 5 seconds before it actually happened) I think Trump would totally remove the US from Syria.Also, Israel, all by their lonesome can take care of Syria (and the rest of the Arabs if need be.).As for Jews controlling US policies, etc., it sure makes the vast majority of Goyim look like  morons and idiots; as if Jewish folks can easily manipulate and control the other 98% of the population because of the stupidity and ignorance of the non-Jewish majority or  politicians.  Reminds me of those Germans, post WWI, that blamed Jews for Germany’s defeat in WWI. Don’t think there were too many Prussian General Staff Officers that were Jewish.Since the end of WWI in 1918 (if not since the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898 at which time the USA established a military presence in the Philippines, Wake Island and Guam) US foreign policy has been dominated by arrogant elitists – many devout Christians  -who believe it is the responsibility of the USA to bring democracy to the world, project US military power around the world and prevent/alleviate world suffering and injustice.It is this mindset  – however lofty, noble and misguided – that has gotten the USA involved in dozens of conflicts that pop up daily or just never end and worse, providing aid to nations that really hate our guts (Pakistan, Arab nations, and probably most Europeans).Trump is the first president in a very long time that believes the USA can no longer sustain this crazy strategy as world policeman AND who actually believes in the greatness of the USA as a nation state (unlike, say, Obama – a communist, or Jimmy Carter  who was just idiot). This policy of Trump is really upsetting the apple cart in the Washington DC sewer that is the govt.By the way, the virulent anti-Semite, racist and devout Christian, Woodrow Wilson,  was the first US president to get the US involved, policy-wise, in the ME and support a Jewish homeland.

            Jews are among the forefront of those saying that America “cannot go back to being an isolationist nation”. Obviously, this is a safe way of defending US involvement in the ME to Israel’s direct benefit. However, US involvement in areas far from the ME also provide tangible benefits for Israel in that they are able to leverage US influence to Israeli benefit on UN votes, military cooperation, economics, “fighting anti-semitism”  etc.If the Israelis are such great friends of ours, you should review the Lavon Affair, the USS Liberty attack, the Pollard case and why Israel would sell arms to Iran shortly after the Islamic Republic was established and then of course during Iran-Contra.Regarding Wilson, there is good evidence that the Balfour Declaration was a payment to Zionists who were able to get their confederates in the US (primarily Bradeis and Franfurter) to push for US entry in WW1. This went against many Jews who normally would not want the US to in any way side with czarist Russia and though Germany’s alliance with the Ottoman empire (which controlled Palestine) was a more promising route for Zionists. Russia of course, would be taken care of later.A prominent Zionist (whose name escapes me) even wrote a letter to Churchill in 1940 saying as such and offering to US Jewish influence to do the same to get the US into WW2.

            In fact, I am not sure how you concluded that Wilson was an anti-semite. Contrary to popular opinion, Christian southerners of the period were extremely philo-semitic. In fact, it was remarkable that a white jury actually took the word of a black man and convicted a Jew in the Leo Frank case. This only started to change with heavy Jewish involvement in the civil rights movement in the 1940s. Wilson himself appointed Louis Brandeis to the SCOTUS and Bernard Baruch to a position of essentially overseeing the US economy during WW1.

                Yes Charleston SC was a jewish city and even fielded a jewish regiment for the south in the civil war.  I stumbled across this when i was searching a database of the prevalence of the name Cohen in usa counties in 1884. Charleston popped up as having alot of cohens .. so i looked into it and discovered the history.   And no i am not autistic, it was website that collated census data on surnames and was popular and intersting.

Later i found a weird box on the door that upon examination yielded a tiny scroll- a mezuza- i learned.  I had moved into a traditionally jewish neighborhood! and that was why people were wondering if i was jewish.  I almost decided to go with to get the kids in the jewish school.  I could on for hours about the antics i (hillbilly) got up to with my elderly jewish neighbors.  They were cool old farts and i like them.
