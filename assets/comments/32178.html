        I wonder who everyone thinks is the best example of a Con Inc person. I nominate Victor Davis Hanson. This fool just came out with a book talking about how civilizations are wiped out completely and the people annihilated. Of course, this book is not designed to warn us about the most serious and impending threat(s) of our annihilation. No. It is designed to gin up a war fever and mobilize the population to fight against the foe that the GAE wants to use us as tools in its global imperial machinations and ambitions.Were it a serious book, it would highlight the alarming demographic situation that we face. It would underscore this by showing how this existential danger is coupled with the almost fatal state of our culture and its near total breakdown in its ability to preserve itself through healthy cultural transmission mechanisms. It would show how this is further threatened by the presence of hostile, alien tribes that are dispossessing us and openly advocating for our annihilation. It would show how these tribes are enabled and supported and funded by the very system he wants us to rally to and, “defend”, against the least of our threats.We have been invaded by alien peoples and our cultural pillars eaten away by a vast infestation of termites. At the same time, the imperial culture and financial system has incentivized our low time preference future thinking nation, those who built and maintain this country – its nation, into below replacement fertility and a frightening demographic winter. The Regime he is calling us to rally toHe incites The Nation to rally to The Regime to fight China – our great threat. Yet, the President of Mexico openly threatens The American Regime with using mass propaganda  on its invading population to sway our elections. It plays both sides, calling them US citizens when it suits and Mexicans when it suits. The GAE can’t even deal with tin pot presidents directly to our south because of the invasion they are facilitating that fills our country with interlopers and demographic replacements of our workforce and our polity.By all four measures of how species go extinct, The GAE Regime has openly abetted all four of them, (loss of territory/habitat; hybridization; infertility; invasive species/competing predators), and is accelerating and seemingly gleefully executing a willful plan to annihilate Our Nation.And what does VDH do? He writes a book at the peak of the crisis and mobilizes the Con Inc. mediasphere to discuss that China is an imminent military threat when we have 2500 ICBMs and them invading and destroying us in our homeland is a practically non-existent threat. It is truly astounding. Were I to have nothing to lose I would travel the country and heckle him with this information at every Q&amp;A session he does. It is breathtaking how the best minds deeply entrenched at our most august institutions are so conveniently clueless.Hey! Look over there Johnny! Look at that thing over there and turn away from your real threats! Absurd doesn’t begin to describe this collection of Deluded Losers.

                It’s not just being out of work. It’s being out of the club. Guys like Hansen, Sailer, Charles Murray, etc., are old enough that I highly doubt that they need the money. But they love being in the punditry club.
They absolutely crave the attention and approval of the ruling class. They being asked to speak, to be noticed in the media, etc. And they also seem to really find working class whites distasteful.

                As I pointed out, I don’t think he is at all sincere. If he was worried about The West being annihilated he would focus on what I pointed out as our biggest threat.VDH exists as part of a machine to perpetuate the GAE and to gin up hysteria for its primary target that requires mobilizing Americans support against it. If he were sincere, he would call for Mayorkas’ head, and he would write a book exposing all of the many open calls for our genocide by powerful figures in politics and religion and show the demographic replacement for what it is.Does he know about this? I am sure that he does. Any person with a 105 IQ and above who knows the facts can infer what is happening and will continue to happen. If the GAE says the solution is to raise alarm and halt and reverse the White Genocide project he will do it. If it says that he needs to promote mass amnesty and giving SoAmerIndians, Sub-Saharans … military and arms training to fight in exchange he will do it.He and all of the people like him do what they are told by the people who pay them. VDH’s role is to give it all a veneer of academic integrity and status.

                Line:  He has known for decades butrefused to face reality because only icky, lower-class people are rayciss.  He has documented the wholesale population replacement of his area of California, and noted the dramatic cultural differences between Whites and the mestizos and indios who replaced them.  But he preferred to pretend they would ‘assimilate’ in time.  Spare NO sympathy for cowards like VDH – whose grandchildren will be helots and slaves due to his craven refusal to recognize racial reality and centuries of historical patterns.

                    You see that attitude (whites playing as a team is low class) with many on the punditry right. Even Sailer and Murray who acknowledge racial differences find the idea of whites thinking and acting as a group to be beneath them and crass.
All these guys consider themselves a part of the intellectual class where they discuss big things with smart people of any race. Of course, they conveniently forget that smart people of other races do, in fact, feel a kinship with their race and approve of playing as a team.

                        Citizen:  The punditry class, the conservatards, the patriotards, the magatards.  Any website you choose – “Look at all the blacks and browns who love Trump!”  I was sitting in the dentist’s office here in the Ozarks, and picked up “Better Homes and Gardens” to browse through.  My mother used to get that magazine.  Every article, ad, and illustration featured non-Whites.  The featured home belonged to a pair of lesbians.  AINO is drenched in the stuff, and so are all the White inhabitants, no matter what they claim as their politics.  It’s considered declasse, rude, not-nice, and un-Christian to notice that the “American” reported about in anything is actually a Haitian or a Han or a hapa.  No, there is no “hope” of awakening among any class in AINO today.

He’s a true “keyboard warrior.” Hereallywants Americans to die—to donate their bodies to military scholarship—especially the other boys who share his humble origins but couldn’t find their way to Stanford.

                    VDH is in no need of a paycheck.  He made enough to date via a long list of books that sold well and still sell today.  His sinecure at the Hoover Institute is quite secure.  He of course does require an audience as he’s been in that business his entire life.VDH is simply a man who is a dyed in the wool CivNat.  Seems everytime we come across these people—successful conservatives who have not crossed over to the DR—we have a special ire for them.  Deal with it, not them—yourself.I have read any number of VDH books and seen his videos he puts out on YT.  I sometimes comment on them with critique as we should here.  The critique is mainly that, as he points out problems wrt national priorities, he rarely points out possible solutions.  In short, he leads “pity parties” for Boomers.However, he is no fool.  His comments are spot on, which is entirely different from not recognizing such at all.  Those folk are the gatekeepers.

                Hansen is the sort who will solemnly wrap up a podcast to an audience of fellow boomers by telling them that the turn-of-the-20th-century immigrants learned English and assimilated to our Anglo culture and the new immigrants will need to do the same, then go down to his local pharmacy and say “Da me una botella de Tylenol extra fuerte, por favor.” Whether he’s sincere is almost beside the point.

                What makes whole generations blind to the obvious? We’re not being run into the ground by the Chinese. The Chinese would at least censor our movies to get rid of the gross stuff out of them. who knows, they might let their protectorate make a patriotic movie every once in while, as a long the ending paid a nod to them.
VDH is a tragic story of what being born mid-century, having enough money for a hobby farm, and being on the speaker’s circuit will do to one’s power of observation.

                    His farm was the family farm, not originally set up as a hobby farm.  It did become one of a sort, when CA changed and such was no longer viable.  However, that, to me anyway, simply gave him more insight into such changes as they overwhelmed CA and then the nation.He, as many others, was of an academic bent rather than that of a farmer and was employed gainfully as faculty in a smallish CA university. I can sympathize as such happened to me.  His entire life has been spent lecturing and writing.  That he still longs to do this is not surprising, and I would say fundamentally different from those (faux?) conservatives who did not come to prominence through such beginnings, but rather through less formal and more suspect means.

            Ugh, VDH is so full of his middling IQ self. A man that takes himself so seriously, stares into the camera, deep sunken eyes, jowls, dulcet tones.
He uses this ‘serious’ persona to sell himself as an intellectual, to dumb people. A King of the Grift, Conservative category.
Vile.

                Back before the invasion of Iraq, VDH, with his serious presentation, persuaded me to support the invasion.
Today, well after over a decade of rejecting conservatism, I still find myself naturally trusting guys like VDH.  I have to remind myself of how the world really works, how wrong guys like VDH are, and that these guys must be some combination of deluded and dishonest.

                That reminds me of something that one of my drill sgt’s in basic said. One day one of the blacks called me a honkey and after I laughed at him (the term never bothered me) another one asked where the word came from. The drill sgt said, “Because that’s the last sound people like you hear before your ass gets run over.”whether that’s true or not, it’s as good an explanation as any.

                    Interesting. Seems the difference here is one of White vs Black (or whomever). There are many things that will get a White in serious physical “trouble” when interacting with Blacks, but nothing that gets Blacks in serious trouble when interacting with Whites. In that lies a reinforcement of bad behavior, which we today are paying a serous price for as a race.

        I agree totally with Z-man’s description of the “Conservative Movement” as it stands: a closed, self-funding circle of insiders, mostly impervious to influence by normal conservative citizens. It’s sad how many millions of Americans are involved with this movement in one way or another, their well-intended energies spent promoting other peoples’ agendas. They cannot see it for what it is.Unfortunately there is a lack of good historical scholarship about how this situation arose. Z-man and others dangle hints but scholarly, book-length treatments are lacking.For my part I believe, but cannot prove, that the post-WWII “Conservative Movement” was largely invented top-down (“astroturfed” in political slang), by anti-communist businessmen coordinating with US intelligence. Some organizations, National Review for instance, may have been CIA ops outright. Or maybe the spooks just brought influence and networking. But clearly there was a nexus. ( I don’t deny the existence of genuine popular elements too, but they were manipulated and co-opted just as they are today ).I think the founders of the “Conservative Movement” saw ordinary Americans as insufficiently willing to keep America on permanent global war footing. There was the usual business grift too (e.g. Koch). But I think enthusiasm for the security state has always been the main thing for the “Conservative Movement.”To be sure, anti-communism in the 1950s was justified: we know now the government was full of communists. However, like Islamism today, communism soon became more of a cartoon bogeyman, politically useful, than a real threat.The aim of the new “Conservative Movement” was to undercut the old conservative movement: to channel the energy of ordinary conservative citizens into causes useful to the funders, and to discredit the anti-war conservatism that was the majority American position right up to Pearl Harbor.At some point in the 1960s, there was further evolution. (1) Zionism became more openly assertive in US politics, eventually insinuating itself into the heart of the “Conservative Movement” via the neoconservatives, then completely taking it over circa the late 1990s. (2) racial/sexual/abortion politics were inflamed deliberately by intellectuals and jurists. Put some extra parentheses around “intellectuals” and “jurists” if you like, but lots of gentiles were involved too.Item (2) is an essay in itself so let’s stick to item (1).Sadly, at this point, the crazies on our side enter the picture and start muddying the waters, trying to connect everything and everybody to an imagined central cabal. Nonetheless, keeping two feet on the ground, it’s still clear that the military complex, ideological Zionists and the intelligence community have a mostly unified agenda. Slavish, fawning, unquestioning support for Israel is the most obvious manifestation.Subordination to a foreign agenda isn’t conservative or patriotic in the least, but support for Israel has now become an article of faith in the “Conservative Movement” to an extent previous generations would have regarded as weird and distasteful. It’s reached almost self-parody now but remains unmentionable. Pat Buchannan was the last major figure I know of to discuss the problem outright. Bernie Sanders and the left wing talk about it to a point. Ilhan Omar and clowns like that talk about it but they are obviously controlled opposition. I think the campus protestors also know the score (hence the Jewish donor class losing their heads over these protests) but they’re too unlikeable to make an appealing case and their minds are otherwise scrambled by the racial/sexual politics aforementioned.There are some court histories of the “Conservative Movement” but very little sober scholarship addressing the theses above because anybody who tries seriously to discuss illegal domestic operations by US intelligence or Israeli/Zionist influence in America immediately leaves polite society. If he achieves any success or popularity its even worse because then his physical safety may come into question.

            I agree with almost everything you wrote, especiallythe post-WWII “Conservative Movement” was largely invented top-down (“astroturfed” in political slang), by anti-communist businessmen coordinating with US intelligenceThe Global American Empire came into existence precisely in this manner. Call it fascism, imperialism, or whatever, but this is exactly how the present system came into being. As you point out, there actually was a danger at one point that provided the basis/excuse for what happened. And for a long period, this abomination kinda/mostly benefitted the populace, even if it is now hostile to the core people. The GAE is the anthesis of a republic, democratic or otherwise, and has been since at least the end of WWII. Christian Zionism also is the antithesis of Christianity, and it is no coincidence those two contortions arose in tandem.It’s reached almost self-parody now but remains unmentionable.That’s the one line from your otherwise brilliant comment that gets some push back. We are seeing this farcical ideology mentioned a lot in derisive terms now and not just in this sphere. It is too little, too late in political terms, but a marker of the systemic collapse that is in its early to mid-stages and is awaiting an economic implosion to take it out.

            Standing athwart history yelling ‘stop’, or whatever the exact phrase is. It was admitting defeat, but to what? Progress! Opposing progress makes you a knuckle dragger, a bad guy.The idea that history has an endpoint, that it’s working in that direction, that this working out is the meaning of life, goes back a long way— a very long way.This is obviously related to the End of History. Truth be told, conservatives and liberals have the same fundamental beliefs, but are on different sides. Conservatives are the losing side.(Interestingly, conservatives have been the Christian party, while liberals have been secular, even post-religion. What does that say wrt the winner/loser relationship? Have to say it— Cross or Empty Tomb?)What’s necessary is to spit out this idea of The End.

        Heritage, otherwise a typical example of the Con, Inc., grifting complex, actually is an exception to O’Sullivan’s Law (“all organizations that are not actually right-wing will over time become left-wing”). The backstory to that is delicious.Heritage appointed a Bushie Deluxe and magical negress, Kay Cole James, as its president late into Trump’s term. True to form, she also was on the take from all the usual suspects, Google looming large among them. As a direct result, once ensconced as Heritage poohbah, James predictably advocated for transgenderism, open borders and threw around racism accusations. During an interview with Tucker Carlson, I think it was, she claimed he was one of the Evil Ones.Heritage donors immediately and shockingly revolted, James activated her Golden Parachute, and Heritage became part of the Faux Right. Heritage now acts all based and stuff and takes positions that a few years back would have caused a staff member to be hurled into the void. In this sense it is an infinitely richer version of Charlie Kirk or Matt Walsh as far as trajectory goes.Other Con, Inc., fraudsters such as National Review were far too slow on the take because the current staffers are far more stupid than their founders. People forget the context, but “The Conservative Case for…” crashed on the shoals of so-called “transgender rights” movement. Google, of course, stuffed hundred dollar bills into National Review’s G-string to get that one printed. AEI, which is more or less a hostile foreign intelligence operation, suffered a similar fate. Look for the Koch roaches to seek out a more deceptive Trojan horse than these old and faded whores, who work their mattresses in the very same way Buckley and that type trash did for decades but with less subtlety.Either True Conservatism has never been tried or it is a more failed and corrupt ideology than Marxism. I know where I’m placing my bet.

            It’s a little bit surprising at just how much of a joke National Review has become.  The only reason I click on any link to them anymore is to confirm my current prejudice that 99% of their content is written by 18 year olds and I’m never disabused of that notion.   I suspect that the only reason that operation is still running is to attract traffic from their aged readers in an attempt to tease valid e-mails and phone numbers out of them.  They pay their high school aged writing staff in Mountain Dew and Funyuns and earn money by selling their reader’s personal information to d**k pill spammers and call centers that target the elderly.

                    HAR HAR HAR!!! 😂👍This is why I come here: the commentariat is even MOAR rotten than the blog host! (Which speaks volumes about Yours Truly too!)But dark humour aside… my questions are these:Is it possible to tear this mess down without breaking out the cartridge boxes?I live in Canada which uses a parliamentary style of govt. The same thing has to be happening here… and yet our conservatives are light years closer to the people and citizens than your Americans. They are taking the fight to the liberals on a national level; smol PP sounds more like Z than he does himself, sometimes. Why is that? Europe sounds like it is teetering the same way… to me it seems that this state of affairs is absolutely opposite of what it should be…Is this state of affairs going to continue? All the hype has it that Americans are getting fed right up with it. I don’t get it? What has happened to our leadership? Look – Washington is now effectively going to war against its own citizens. CEO’s are making war on their own customers. Bud Light, Adidas, Gillette,etc…and they’re losing.I’m splitting a gut laughing about that too. The execs at Disney realized they’re hemorrhaging money because of their woke agenda and they fired half of Pixar, and announced their new mission statement was to return to family entertainment. What happens? The latest Star Wars is about powerful female black communist lesbians that left their audience retching and puking…even the lefties aren’t watching it and the ratings are abominable. (I think The Critical Drinker is in hospital on life support…). How is it that neoliberalism is still a thing? Hell’s bells…the CHURCHES are literally dead on their feet and yet the queers, the pedos and other perverts are STILL in control?I wonder what planet I’m on sometimes…

        Just saw where the US is pledging Russian-owned $-backed assets for “loans” to Ukraine.  This is the equivalent of rifling through little brothers pockets for spare change, and marks the end of the money pipeline spigot to Ukraine.  As Zman points out, things will play out toward the end of the summer.  This was the best scheme they could throw together after the House’s spiteful flag waving drama and due to election countdown.  How inspirational it must be for a place like New Palestine OH to see the spiteful mutants in Congress pull out all the stops for Ukraine.

        I haven’t listened to the podcast yet, but this is what Nick Fuentes has been talking about the past couple weeks (and what Z mocked him for in last week’s pod). The conservacuck operation not only did not change in response to Trump’s victory and the obvious winning playbook that emerged from it (roughly, the Sailer Strategy), they acted as the first line of defense for the regime against Trump. They did it very well, because of Trump’s lack of understanding of DC as well as his weakness for flattery (something a lot of people, like Netanyahu, also exploited, and also something that the shitlibs failed to). In 2020 they openly worked with the liberals to steal the election, as outlined in Molly Ball’s TIME article. In 2024 they are doing the same thing, except Trump seems more willing to play ball than he was back then, maybe because he is older, more tired, and has real personal stakes here in a victory.

            Decadent phase, good times, bad times, that truism always holds. The varying differential between tolerance to it from the plebiscite class relies on either how much they benefit or how close a blade they wield (metaphorically or not) to their betters.

                    Doubt it. There are always corruptible individuals. All the decadent phase does is make them a little less expensive. In no small part to they are subject to blackmail.

        My own Congressman is a f–ing POS. He used to be the state GOP chairman but resigned to run for an open seat in a super-Republican gerrymander in what is otherwise a very deep Blue state. He’s a total Zio-shill and Israel/Ukraine bootlicker. His hand-picked “conservative” predecessor resigned rather than vote against gun control.Same thing with my State senator. Tells the rubes what they want to hear to continually get re-elected in his Republican gerrymander, but is 100% impotent in the statehouse, which is controlled by the radical left 2:1.Cashes in his state paychecks and pads his state pension to go through the motions.Ka-ching. Total grifters.

            We have the same here in AZ.  The race you want to win is in the primary, not the general.  The primaries illustrate the struggle for the soul of the Rep party.  Here we call these people, RINO’s.  This brings out the ire in the “conservative” wing of the party.  They *want* ineffectual legislators as long as they are Republicans.  They claim that the Trumpists are too extreme.  They are of the ilk who “vote harder” when inevitably they are disappointed by their winning candidate.

        Yes, the Borg is real. Yes, it dominates DC and rules us from the shadows. No, voting harder will never fix this. The only cure is collapse because that begets the fog of chaos and provides the necessary camouflage for remedy. They are aiming for a managed collapse in which the plebs go crazy and Jim Bob starts offing his woke neighbors. This would then justify a jackboot reaction and enable transition to a techo-tyranny. What beats this? Anonymous antibodies does. A lot of oligarchs took serious note of Prigozhin’s fate. Just sayin’.

        Fascinating, thank you for this. At least those of us who are shut out of this system can keep a relatively clear conscience. Imagine going around day to day with that desperate fear of wrongthink which you described, which results in such craven behavior by these people, who are so desperate to maintain their position. The same process, in a far-left context, is at work, of course in the educational system now.  I agree that it doesn’t appear that this system can be reformed somehow.I’ve wondered for a long time why the quality of leadership has been so low for so many years, in a country with such a huge population. Why have no Clay, Webster, or Calhoun appeared, or even a TR, Robert Taft, or Eisenhower, whatever their faults might have been. Why Cuomo, Bush, Clinton, Trump, Paul and other dynasties keep arising, (not to mention the Podhoretz’s, Kristol’s, etc.) when there are so many other good minds and hearts out there. This helps explain it.On a slightly related tangent, I’ve been reading the recent book Big Intel, by Michael Waller, about the transformation of the FBI and CIA. Horrifying stuff.

        The first one who comes to mind is Eric Ericsson from Red State, but he’s really a wanna-be. I remember the 2nd year of barry’s first term and there was all furor over another proposed amnesty.I was perusing the boards at Red State on this subject and a user there posted a link to a series of graphs and tables showing how if we removed the illegals from our country, everything from violent crime, to the overcrowding of the schools, to the bankrupting of the social safety net would drop dramatically.Ericsson responded by saying, “We don’t need your anti-hispanic racism here, you’re banned!” I remember thinking that it was no wonder we can’t win, these people refuse to call a spade a spade.

        Cliff Asness is an odd character. He’s one of the founders of AQR, which is a monster mutual fund company. I believe that AQR was a general hedge fund before transitioning to retail.Anyway, Asness is your classic NYC Jew. He proclaims to be more or less a libertarian but is also a (quiet) Zionist. So, yeah, open borders and individualism for thee and nationalism for me. He also, of course, hated Trump. Why? Who knows. It’s why he loves Goldberg so much.Like his fellow NYC money changer Ackman, Asness was shocked, shocked to discover after Oct. 7 that college campuses were filled with people who hated whites and was on a rampage to get his alma mater Penn back in line. He blocked me on Twitter for pointing that he never cared when those same types were calling for whites to die, but now he cares because they’re attacking Jews.Funny thing about Asness is that I believe he married the Midwest daughter of a pastor or something like that, which, now that I think of it, is also pretty typical of Jews.

            Exactly. And the reason is that they are buying government interference which provides nothing of value to the health of the republic or its polity.
You can complain about the money if you like, but there are always back channels and black markets. Or you can complain about the government itself producing “bads”. It’s not unintended consequences — they know what the outcomes will be.

        The “cock” brothers – love it.As far as the CIC – conservative industrial complex/libshit industrial complex – I say we take off and nuke the site from orbit – it’s the only way to be sure.  There is absolutely no way to reform the system.While I do support the NRA, it’s just basic. The column in their mag where they have short stories of joe/jane normie defending him/herself, home or others from intruders/attackers never identify the perps other than “a man, two men etc.”, when we all know it’s jigs. Come on assholes, just tell it like it is.  Whoops, I guess donations might be impacted…

            The NRA stories that you cite are almost entirely stories taken from MSM, albeit conservative and small town media.  Therefore, the wording will be tempered to reflect those prohibitions wrt race of perp.  It is *not* necessarily censorship by NRA, nor can the NRA “add” such details and still claim to quote the source accurately.

        Somewhat related, the Conservative Industrial Complex only works in a stable system. Introduce chaos and it starts to break down.Trump in 2016 was the first sign of the breakdown, as he was driven by mostly young White male gamers outraged that their games were gayified and diversified by the Kathleen Kennedy rule. As the core voters and mass donors, their money and mobilization easily outpaced the mercenary donor system the way Napoleon’s mass levies of national armies outpaced the aristocratic regimes of mercenaries.While Trump is the only one to successfully defy the Conservative Industrial Complex, others will follow based on charisma and patronage to a much wider group than the Conservative Industrial Complex can scale towards. At most, Con Inc can only support a tiny few, no more than say 20,000 tops. There are a lot more White men than that, frozen out of the Fortune 500, University System, Military, NGO-istan, etc. wanting/needing a leader and patronage.Zerohedge is reporting that the House passed the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, which mandates AUTOMATIC registration of all males 18-26 for the Draft. Supposedly, service will be four years. Yep, Draft is coming. War with Russia in Ukraine is coming.So, JUST as I predicted, White guys (no way gays, diverse etc get sent) will be fighting and dying on the Russian front. We can expect the mother of all draft riots and other things as this progresses. [The other shoe to drop is forcing older White guys into unpaid defense work as demanded]

        From today’s / yesterday’s Zerohedge article, there is a link to a US Army War College Article discussing the Ukraine War and essentially, what a fight with Russia and/or China would look like:https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3240&amp;context=parameters“The Russia-Ukraine War is exposing significant vulnerabilities in the Army’s strategic personnel depth and ability to withstand and replace casualties.11 Army theater medical planners may anticipate a sustained rate of roughly 3,600 casualties per day, ranging from those killed in action to those wounded in action or suffering disease or other non-battle injuries.12 With a 25 percent predicted replacement rate, the personnel system will require 800 new personnel each day. For context, the United States sustained about 50,000 casualties in two decades of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In large-scale combat operations, the United States could experience that same number of casualties in two weeks.”So in two weeks, 50,000 US dead or badly wounded (unable to fight) or MIA.All that Forever War nonsense required: A. no serious peer or near-peer adversary. B. Casualty rates in a volunteer military at 200+ a month, more or less. C. No serious imposition to the way of life of ordinary people.Neither Con Inc nor Leftism State can survive the manpower losses, let alone the material losses, of such a war. It looks to me that the Military has been telling the Hard Left and Con Inc (the unholy marriage of Mao and Blackrock) that this path is unsustainable and the leadership Jonah Goldberg up to Hillary and Obama just are not listening because the corporate media paints the Russians as Iraqi-Saddam lite.Expect full war by August.

        Conservative Inc. will be a lot different in 30 years.Think of Conservative, Inc. in 1990. It was the last gasp of the stuffy Reaganite-Libertarian, common-sense, WASPy, anti-Soviet, big-business-barbecue-and-football Conservatism, with a tinge of benign racism, which had dominated since the 1960s.Prior to 1960, most Conservatives (Democrat and Republican) were self-made, God-fearin’, hell-bent on beating Communism and gub’mint programs, and segregatin’ the races.By 2020 Conservative Inc. was a mere echo, a last gasp, of the immoral crony Conservatism that started with the W. Bush years. It had become the bloated, irrelevant husk of a political bloc that didn’t know how to win nor who its voter base was. It had money, and Boomer eyeballs, but not much more.In 2050, I suspect Conservative, Inc. will be diverse and populist…imagine Tuckers, Don Juniors, Ramaswamies, and other lightly-based blacks and browns. There’s no way Mitch McConnel types will remain in our turbulent future.

Now they’re a wad of geriatric, delusional, feather-pated boobs who deploy their heavy wads in support of a treasonous political class. As such, they’re worthy only of the very profoundest contempt.

        One positive step would be to disperse the bureaucrats.MoveInteriorto the west, say, Denver or another city.They would be closer to their assets, meaning all that Federal land, and closer to the constituents who benefit from or more likely suffer from their acts.Next, move other departments, or abolish them. The favorite for the latter isEducation.They don’t educate. Student performance is declining. They suck up resources and suck up to the proggie notions that accelerate the decline. Return their functions to the states.Some departments could be more responsive and accountable with some broad policy steps like eliminatingDEI. All those whodidn’tearnit, and their under-qualified supporters in the government and those NGOs would have to earn an honest living. That is another step in reducing the money-laundering, too.Develop a dashboard for Congress to show who gets paid how much by whom, and factor in the pro and con for citizens in all that grifting and self-dealing.The voters would probably say that there isn’t much value added by all that federal employment in and around DC and NoVA. Incestuous actions by compromised PMC and MIC elitists to preserve their grifts don’t help the country but rather destabilize it.

            On the proximity to the ruled/subjects/administrative-zone suggestion it is problematic. Denver is Africanizing rapidly. It has taken the same path as California in embracing an accelerated Great Replacement. The bureaucrats would not be close to Americans, but to the aliens they have imported. Why would they live near the favella? The second problem is that a large number of them open every meeting with a, “land acknowledgement”, which abrogates the American Nation’s claims on Our land. It is 20 years too late for this suggestion – probably 40.The DIE reform is non-viable because it uses the same failed assumption that “Conservatism”, has rested on for decades. Namely, that a policy change will work because the enforcers will all be civic-minded, law-abiding Americans acting in good faith to enforce a law even if they do not agree with it. They want their outcome and they want their racial patronage network and they will lie and slither to build it. The only thing that can be done is to sue all instances of this anti-White pogrom to the ground. This should be particularly obvious in government since public and government racial discrimination was the target of the CRA – at least in the letter of the law but not its spirit. Open up an endless series of brushfires for The Regime to respond to. There will be some wins that are tactical victories. Someday, they will result in a strategic victory – namely the end of the Anti-White Civil Rights Regime and the discrediting and clear illegitimacy of The Regime.The most viable action you suggest is the dashboard. I encourage you to undertake that project, and make it visible. Similarly, a dashboard on The Great Replacement in every single area would be a great project.That action is a good one not because it will reform the system, rather it will highlight and accelerate its illegitimacy.

                    Sort of a business term, but used in many areas – like a car dashboard, it is a one pager that has information on various indicators of interest.  You have probably seen them if you have used a health care facility and they set you up on line with something like “mychart” showing your last visit, maybe what your last vitals were, etc.  Also some workout apps will have one with various info on your last workout or progress to goals.  Concept is to give you a quick snapshot of things that are of interest.

            In the event we get our Red Caesar, I would applaud moving the national capital to Topeka, say. Or even Kodiak. Indonesia is moving its capital from Jakarta to some jungle town on Borneo…if they can do it, we can.
But sadly we’re at a place where Indonesia is more competent (or at least freer) than the USA.

                Jakarta’s a steamy shit hole that is sinking into the ocean, so I don’t really blame them.  Although Borneo’s probably not much better.  The Burmese were smarter when they built their new capital during the first decade of the 21st century.  They put in a location that made it capable of flexing state muscle in disparate regions while simultaneously making it impregnable to an uprising.The schemers that run our country would never consent to moving the capital unless it was to an already existing cultural hotbed.  Remember when Amazon held an civic extortion lottery for its HQ2 project?  Oh sure, every state in the union submitted applications, but in the end it was split between NYC and DC (with NYC’s plans being scuttled by the complaints of native New Yorkers).  There was never any possibility that that project would land in some icky backwater like Little Rock or Rochester.  The beautiful people who work at Amazon just couldn’t hold their noses long enough to make that happen. The NPCs that staff the GAE will never consent to be scattered like so many cockroaches.

                    Yangon is a decrepit cesspool, literally the open sewers reek of the national fish sauce and you can fall in because protestors dislodged the cement covers. The government has abandoned it. If by “new capital” you mean Mandalay then, yes, things are looking good up there last time visited (five years or less). The military junta is incredibly stupid though in its treatment of majority of the population. The way it assigns electricity to villages, for example. Like the US, Myanmar, or as the natives prefer overwhelmingly “Burma,” is controlled to a great degree by the City of London folks.

                    Jakarta is a steamy shit hole but the dirty secret is that it can be a *fun* steamy shit hole. In small doses. Just saying. Definitely not when it floods in rainy season though.
I figure that they’re moving the capital to Kalimantan to be closer to the oil / gas money spigot. That being said, the idea of having Borneo head-hunters rioting in the new capital instead of your usual garden variety Jakarta anti-Chinese pogrom is intriguing.

                    You know, I’ve never even been to DC. And based upon the travelogue I’m getting around here, I’m not exceedingly tempted to. The last thing I need to see is packs of boons and fruity heauxmeaux.

                        We live on the Eastern Seaboard. My husband got a remote job in a company based in DC. Our collective decision was that DC was the last place on earth we’d move to. He would find another job in closer to home. He had to visit enough for work to confirm the decision.There is more to DC people wise. There’s also a bunch of low income foreigners, all trying to make money in the servant trade. There’s a bunch of political hipsters, who like food and running marathons, mostly of native stock but plenty of foreigners too. They do the ultra important Power point jobs that won’t do themselves. There’s actual Americans too, serving in the military. They spotted by their uniforms. I guess DC/DC area has high number of finkels per capita, so you can do some of that spotting too.In any event getting to the place where VA starts and DC sprawl stops is enough to make me want to kiss the ground. And I’m not even from VA.

            More realistically, a reversal of Citizens United v Federal Election Commission decision would take most of the huge donors out of the election cycle.
This will never happen, of course.
This money sloshing around podcast today reminded me of that Segal movie “Under Siege” where crazy navy officer played by Gary Busey when asked what he would do with $100 million dollars answered:
“I’m going to buy the Presidency!”
Laughable today, because that would only buy a Senate seat, at most.

        The problem with the legacy right wing is that it is constantly on the defensive. If you want to lose a battle, fight with “on the defensive” on the brain.The notions of the right are couched against the leading contender, the liberal Left, because reaction, not proaction, is the preferred mode of being.Consider abortion rights. The right managed a major victory with the help of its allies on the Supreme Court, and it is prepared to squander this victory to make nice with the liberals. You can see it in their faces. The liberal slate of politics is the preferred order of the day, and to be part of acceptable society, the right’s standbearers go along with the preferred order of the day.It is said a shark must go on swimming to get the oxygen it needs to survive. If the right wants to survive, it should act more like a shark, seeking aggressive action, and less like a jellyfish getting poked at by sticks from the cool kids on the seashore.— Greg Nikolic (www.dark.sport.blog)

            I know there are many in the party who feel this way, but there is a larger group of people – myself included – who don’t give a shit about abortion if it means that we’re going to lose elections with bigger, more important issues at stake.I have friends who are staunchly Catholic and even they feel this way. This attitude of “Well, yes the left swept the elections and sodomy is now the law of the land. True your once nice, quiet neighborhood has been flooded with brown, biological garbage from various third world shit holes and that has reduced your property value to just about zero, putting you financially under water. But hey, we overturned Roe v Wade!” will be the death of us.

                My abortion views have changed significantly.  While I still find it ghoulish, horrid, and a grave sin, I advocate that my enemies abort all their children, such that my posterity can more easily inherit the Earth.
it is good for such ghoulish people, those who will murder their own children, to minimize their contribution to the gene pool.

                Abortion as we’ve known it has changed.  Most all abortion—estimates as high as 80%—is now done through medication, i.e., “morning after pill”-type applications.  Nor is such confined to “morning after” time line if I read correctly.  You can chemically abort quite a long time after conception.  Recently, the SCOTUS has overturned prohibition of mail order abortion/contraception pills (IIRC), hence allowing de facto abortion in all States once again.All this is fine with me as well as I’ve come to believe that the principle here is when does the State award “personhood” to the fetus, not “life” as at time of conception.  In nature it is estimate by some biologists that perhaps most egg and sperm combinations are “naturally” aborted as they fail to implant in the uterus.  To me a blastocyst is not really a human with rights (personhood) at this point.However, I concede that the Leftist abortion rights activists will not settle for any cutoff point in their “sacrament” of abortion and have shown in their efforts (here in AZ with a proposed State Constitutional Amendment) to limit abortion in any manner whatsoever.  Late term abortion is murder for any use outside of mother’s life dilemmas.

It’s worse than you suppose.  The GOP Congress is paid by its donors to lose:  to give the voters a false sense of choice, to support open borders and Israel, and to dissipate any white advocacy.

            The legacy right wing exists to lose. That is its main purpose. Even if you go back to that famous line from Buckley about “standing athwart history, yelling Stop” implies that progressive liberalism is the default and inevitable, and it is the conservative job to manage it. Their job is to make the case for why progressive liberalism is, in fact, a good thing, and it is time for you troglodytes to get on board with it. You saw this recently with the “conservative case for Juneteenth” that all of the sudden came out after the liberals said that this was the new holiday. None of the people making the conservative case for Juneteenth knew what the “holiday” was two years prior, but they got their marching orders.So, they never win, they always lose, they have never conserved anything, but this is by design. I also am not convinced at all that they wanted RvW to be overturned, nor did they expect it. Their fecklessness and cowardice afterwards was exactly what I would have expected from total losers, in that they didn’t know what to do with a win (note how liberals pivoted from gay marriage to transgenderism instantly).And, you know, Trump called them all losers, and they know they are losers. If Trump got his way and started winning, then they would all find themselves out of work and out of the lifestyle they have grown accustomed to, because there would be no place for a bunch of losers in the system.
