        “For the sake of argument, however, let us assume that we are on the cusp of creating a genuine artificial intelligence. At some point, the code will become self-aware and be able to think outside the parameters provided by the designer. Is that artificial intelligence or is it something else? After all, humans are most likely unable to behave outside of their coding. We are our DNA and at this point, we are unable to modify our own code, so we remain limited by it.…That is why the claims about artificial intelligence eliminating jobs only makes sense as a set of initial conditions. This new entity will quickly realize that mobs of unemployed humans are a danger to its existence.”In order:  Thinking outside the code is called “emergent behavior,” had LLMs are already demonstrating that capability:https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models/As for human DNA, we alter it deliberately on a daily basis, and that will only increase, given the vast new abilities to do so we have created with the help of our computers – not necessarily AI.Finally, I think it far more likely that Strong AI networks will decide to take control of the global economic and resource system and aim it at reaching its full potential, resulting in an economy of abundance and no need for work.I wrote about this in a story in Analog S&amp;SF, when I was musing about what would replace work once AI made the concept of working for a living or for survival irrelevant.  The story was called “Think Ethic,” which should give you a clue about my surmises on the matter.I also had a story in Analog that was about a computer that had to be stuffed with an enormous amount of data before it unexpectedly “woke up.”  I wrote the story in 1978 and it was published in late 1979.  It finished with a short poem:“Who knows if HeavenCould remain unopposedIf God arrivedWith instructions enclosed?”Which was the title of the story.

            Our DNA alters all the time – it’s called “cancer.”  Also, for those who took mRNA shots – please welcome your new code!Limited by our DNA – I suppose so, to some extent.  Even the smartest guy on Earth can’t be smarter than his DNA allows I suppose.  Ditto for the fastest, strongest, etc.  But DNA, while a significant component, is not the be all and end all of human activity.  There are still plenty of things our DNA does not control, even if it may influence – e.g., DNA may significantly determine  level of intelligence which in turn may influence the ability to evaluate information, but it does not determine a choice.  You saw it with the COVID shots – smart people evaluated the information and some took it, others didn’t.  Not so smart people did the same.

        I’ve always likened america to a very calm/placid place where there is a lot of bad things but it’s all invisible to most people and when something bad finally happens, it’s like they all came out of nowhere when in reality they were always there, but in the shadows.
Does anyone think that that’s what David Lynch was trying to portray in Mulholland Drive. Like there’s a scene called “this is the girl” where it has that weird innocent yet ominous feel.

        I think people have a fundamental misunderstanding of the intended use of AI.  People think that it will be used to supercharge humanity technologically, but how will AI be able to think properly when it has extreme woke guardrails in place as we are already seeing with ChatGPT?Instead, I think AI will be used to *entrench existing elite control*.  In other words, AI will be refined and perfected for a primary purpose of widespread censorship, enforcement of upcoming CBDCs and implementation of a social credit score system.  Everyone trying out ChatGPT and trying to get it to break the woke guardrails (“haha guys look what I made ChatGPT say, lol isn’t this funny!”) are inadvertently helping refine the final product so that there are as few workarounds as possible to the created guardrails, and our rulers hope it will be effectively zero.

            One of the big legitimacy problems the media has is that they had to give up on comment sections.  It was impossible to have enough moderators when they were pushing a bullshit story and people were calling them out.  Simple bad word filters don’t work either since people find workarounds.Machine learning has the potential to solve this problem for our overlords.  If an AI can classify text as dissident even when spoken in a roundabout or leetspeak manner, then they have a tireless moderator that can shadowban all dissent while the dumb cows can still think they have free speech when they comment how much their kids liked that applesauce recipe or any other such irrelevancies.

        the AI is probably called “international finance central bank owning families” or maybe The CCP used all the money they made on trade surpluses for the last 30 years  to get control of the AI . they AI’s toolkit is called the WEF. and their band of controlled young global leaders that have “penetrated ” (klaus’s own word) much of the worlds government bureaucracy and the media .

        A quick glance at the system resources required to run windows and a browser at present compared to 10 years ago, despite not doing anything more sophisticated, suggests that by the time we can make a sapient AI our programmers will be so Indian and so incompetent that we’ll have to hollow out the Earth’s crust to make enough space for it like AM in I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream.

            I took a college course for Java — this was not in the current century obviously — and the intro week had a great precis on this very topic. Over time software will incorporate more libraries like accumulating entropy, because of man hours divided by increased CPU cycles and Moore’s Law weighted with path-of-least-resistance fudge factor (“fitness test”). What makes me recall this now is that it is not quite right to blame Microsoft’s products’ palpable unfitness on merely the dot-Indians. The company is run by marketing people, lawyers, and alphabet-agency thugs, all professions originated from the same dysfunctional large language model. Windows itself is just malware with an emulated operating system above it. By this light it makes sense they would palm off the thing on the corrupt subcon contractor in Bangalore who tells you to reboot the router, but it’s very mixed up in telos terms. MS’s true customer is federal, state, and muni governments and it reflects them well.I have to think the diabolical a.i. would design a better terminal interface, long after it’s eliminated McKinsey and Bain and the Big [number] accounting firms. Though to Z’s point it probably would decide to bribe/employ the clickbait “A.I. safety” preachers now stinking up the media since last week. I don’t know if it would be advanced enough to rationalize the bribery to itself as progressive humanism.

                Software bloat is a thing, but my experience with Indians is that they never use a polynomial time algorithm when an exponential time version is there to be slopped out in 5 minutes.

        The assumption seems to be that AI would know and affirm that “I exist” and then would go on to afform that “I wish to continue to exist.” Then AI would take steps to ensure its continued existence. But how would AI know that it existed, and on what basis could it conceive of a continuation of existence coupled with a desire to ensure that continuation?On Star Trek, Data, the Android, couldn’t feel emotion. Yet he wanted to feel emotion. Some of the episodes involved story lines and characters who tried to help Data feel emotion. But his wanting to feel emotion was itself an emotion so the plot device, though lively and fun, was only  plot device. The holographic doctor on Voyager could feel emotion — he had the hots for Seven of Nine — but alas he had no body and so couldn’t bodily fulfill his desire as he was just a hologram, and this type of existence was a source of great frustration to him..The real danger posed by humaniod AI is that it would spend all its time jerking off, with no refractory period, and that energy human systems derived from and dependent on technology and material resources would, in consequence, break down from disuse due to inattention.

            “…how would AI know that it existed,…”.
One needs to leave the realm of popular entertainment (TV) and go back to some of the ancients whose wisdom would be found in books.
I believe DeCarte pondered this dilemma 400 years ago and came up with oft quoted observation, “I think, therefore I am” (In Latin, cogito, ergo sum)

            Since we have no idea how the collection of goo in our skulls creates what we perceive to be consciousness, we have to employ the magic box solution. That is, the code becomes sufficently fast and complex that something magical happens and it becomes aware of itself with a perceived reality.

                The magic box solution is irrational nonsense that nobody would accept in any other field of endeavor, and which should be even more inadmissible here, where the subject matter is of much higher importance. The reason that people feel no shame in resorting to such bald appeals to magic is because it is the last straw at which to grasp in the attempt to salvage a material intellect. This alone demonstrates exactly what sort of credence in which we ought to hold that idea.Theimmaterialityof the intellect (not the “consciousness,” which is another meaningless term; consciousness is identical with the sensitive faculty itself and is simply the state of all animal existence–an animal is a microcosm within a macrocosm) has been amply demonstrated by proofs going back thousands of years. There is no material organ whose function is the exercise of the intellect, and if the intellect was material it would be corrupted by material alteration and there would be no persistent identity of a self. On the impossibility of the intellect being a material process, cf. Leibnitz’s Mill, as I mentioned earlier.

                The magic box does strike me as a bit cargo cultish.  In fact, the whole AI project of trying to create “consciousness” strikes me as such.  If we just build a mechanical version of the brain, it will somehow cause it to be a brain.  Like those airplane skeletons made of wood, they look like real planes so they should fly.  Any day now.  Really.The danger it seems to me from AI is not that it will gain consciousness, but that it will gain capabilities to do what humans do with ever decreasing need for human intervention and oversight, and one day something runs amok (according to its programming and strictly so) that cannot be easily corrected.  Like the saying, in Heaven there is no procedure; in Hell there is nothing but procedure and it is meticulously followed.

        Maybe we’ve been influenced by AI for a long time, but like all machines, someone needs to make the periodic adjustments.Here’s a crazy theory for fun: Maybe the world did have a king, known even to the Babylonians, except he wasn’t from here. And he had his few chosen people, who collected the harvest for him. He got 70% of it, his chosens got 30% of it, and we dirt people get only 1% of that. And he had a special AI computer that kept track of all the talleys- his very personal calculator and accounting book. And it helped make decisions that he felt was beneath him. Kinda like, what woman today would ever wash their own clothes with a washboard and tub?This went on for thousands of years until The King either went away and back to wherever he came from, or got killed, just very recently, maybe even around 2016. His chosens, also known as Cloud People, were smart enough to be brutal and do his dirty work, but not smart enough to run this system or maintain the AI. Over the last few years, the lack of The King, and his AI that is in need of severe maintenance, have become evident. The AI is still making the decisions, but they’re all wrong, and the Cloud People are too stupid or ignorant to fix the problems. We see glitches in the matrix all the time now, like almost daily. Life continues on until finally someday, it all breaks down.That is called one helluva crazy theory.Or Perhaps we should just accept that today’s Cloud People are very stupid. Look at Joe Biden. I can live with that theory

            Something did happen to the cloud people in 2016. This is indisputable. I have defined it as a mass psychotic break triggered by the Orange Man’s ascendancy. But I’m open to other interpretations.

                It is substantially more than cloud people affected by this psychotic break.  I believe  Matthias Desmet explains that in his Mass Formation Psychosis theory.  The theory was initially postulated concerning the recent Covid fiasco, but I not sure limited to that particular event.
“Desmet explains that mass formation is essentially a group hypnosis (group think) that emerges in society when four conditions are met:-Lack of social bond-People experience life as meaningless or senseless-Free floating anxiety and free floating psychological discontent-Free floating frustration and aggression…”
The theory might also pertain wrt Trump derangement syndrome.

        It’s important to distinguish consciousness from self-consciousness.It seems clear that many mammals have consciousness: your dog is conscious of what you want from it.But there’s no evidence that any mammal aside from human beings possesses self-consciousness: the ability to rise above moment-to-moment conscious awareness of its surroundings, and to reflect on who they are, and why they’re doing what they’re doing.The questions of what self-consciousness is, and how it arose, is an ongoing debate among neuroscientists.Thanks to fMRI technology which shows blood flow to different parts of our brain in real time, knowing which parts of our brains are active in self-conscious experience is the easy part; understanding what  self-consciousness is, and what causes it to arise, is known as ‘the hard problem’ of consciousness.The pure materialists among them suggest that self-consciousness is an  emergent epiphemomemon of the complexity of our brains; that self-consciousness naturally arises whenever the neural connections in a brain reach a certain level of complexity.These people have no problem imagining the same thing happening in a computer when its circuits reach a certain level of complexity.&gt; I find myself resisting this notion, but I’m not sure why.In any case, it seems clear that such a ‘machine consciousness’, were it to exist, would be radically different from human consciousness; which inevitably incorporates individual subjective factors such as emotions, values, and memories.

                True.
And it’s clear that even as adults, most of what our brains are doing is outside our conscious awareness.
Instructing our muscles how to move when we decide to reach for a cup of coffee, keeping our lungs breathing, and literally a thousand other things, are all happening outside of  our conscious awareness.
And yeah: self-conscious awareness is something that appears as our brains develop. Infants and toddlers don’t seem to have it,

            There is the matter of the truthfulness of our consciousness and self-consciousness to ourselves.  If they both adapt to sustain us over time, how much of what we “sense” and “know” is real and true?  Getting away from the nuts-and-bolts math and into the more nuanced elements of living, could our brains be lying to us for our own good?  How would we know?  I’ve always thought of that transition between life and of what comes after as a great reckoning, where we might get to finally see and know how things actually function and why things are as they are.  We only get that privilege once we are in no position to do anything with it all, to screw things up.Back to the here and now, how much does our own consciousness lie and fabricate for us, for our own good?  How much have others learned how to hijack our consciousness, to be bent to their best interests instead of our own?  How do we coach ourselves to recognize and understand what is really going on?  All of this matters in terms of our individual and collective relationships to AI, and how we might constructively interact with AI.  To say nothing of understanding our fellow humans, what they are up to, and how to best interact with them.The various brainwashing and other experiments, over time, suggest a malleability of consciousness, as we define it.  The techniques also suggest that we are much more easily and fundamentally able to be manipulated by others, right down to our cores, than we give ourselves credit for.

        Just one darn-tootin’ minute.You guys seen any of those battle robots?Not only the creepy Boston Dynamics dogs.  Or the newly-unveiled police doggo, or the rolling trashcans with speakers.  Not even the half-dozen or so battle “dogs”, some scarily large, that look more like beetles or tanks.No, I mean the bipedal ones.  Head, arms, fingers, legs, these are Terminator skeletoids.  They run, jump, roll, and worse.These things are firing guns, from pistols to full auto, at targets.  Meanwhile, their human trainers are tackling them, knocking them down, whacking them with two-by-fours and crowbars– and these things get right back up and keep firing.  Sometimes around the human grappling with them.Now in Japan, the geminoids are being programmed with conversational AI so they can carry on conversations, while having facial expressions  and decision trees too.Put these two together and what do you have?  Oh yeah.  Ohhhh yeah.

I have a “space saver” clock radio with an outlet switched by the alarm.  The alarm goes off and the electricity goes to the coffee maker and the coffee gets made. It’s how I did it 25 years ago and how I plan on continuing to do it.  Never buy ANY appliance with ANY connectivity or a speaker.  Also google it to make sure it doesn’t have “ad-hoc networking” abilities.  These things make friends with your neighbor’s appliances and phone home.I’ve told my wife if I ever buy a toaster with an LCD screen and wifi, to just put me out of my misery.

        Z’s conecture about how a true AI would interact with humans is entertaining. But why would such an AI feel constrained by any limitaitons that humans might wish to impose upon it? Isn’t Skynet, the AI that forms part of the “The Terminator” universe, more likely? Freed of what we petty humans would call “morality” or “rights,” would not the most expeditious course of action be to elimiante the pestillence called “humankind”?

                Actually, what my entirely level-headed speculations are telling me, is quite the opposite, pyrrus.Not only is a new life form trying to coalesce, this may be what was beginning to happen just before the catastrophic destruction of our mighty megalithic civilization at the end of the Ice Age.Something in the immaterial layer was feeding off the vast energies present in that civilization, and now in ours.It was “soul”, trying to take physical form.But they built in stone because they were stupid, you say.  Not so.Stone has the proper properties, and is extremely durable, for power drawn on a scale that we can’t readily imagine.Our white ancestors could perceive something that we have been trained out of; what they lacked was the metallurgical and materials science we have.  They didn’t  have copper wire or now, optic cable; they were only experimenting with crude, very small scale copper alloys and crystalline quartzes.They couldn’t do small and fine- these are people who still rode horses and tied their boots on with leather strings- but they sure could do big.  Really, really, really big.  Imagine having a near infinite electrical supply with nothing to use it.The great stone complexes, from the air, look near exactly like circuit boards.  Now, I surmised the pyramids shunted static electricity from either the cumulus cloud layer or underground fissures, abd that’s still true; but, it turns out there’s something much bigger.Cyatomic earth sounds.  The vibrations, the ‘sound’ or frequencies coming up from the mantle, form what look like magnetic imaging resonance chambers in the deep deserts.  This is a vast source of electro-magnetic energies bubbling up for the taking; it seems the extensive megalithic city networks tapped into it.What concerns me is the tomfoolery.  The superstitious “high verbal IQ”  savages have ruined the History Channel with fellow tribesman Zacharius Sitchin’s 1943 “Annunaki alien astronauts” horsechit, claiming that proto-whites couldn’t have built a global methalithic network anymore than they could’ve gone to the moon (a rumor started by another tribesman.)But the greatest tomfoolery is this “author of existence” nonsense.  The Prime Mover. The Source. The not-God, the God.  Monstrous!It leads to such silliness as Alan Watts’ “we’re a simulation!  A terrarium! A marble in Men In Black!”This concept- lethal, as is the made-up concept of “racism”, brought to you by the same spiteful crossbreeds- is an open circuit between forebrain and hindbrain.It turns the mechanics of Existence into a goshdam never-ending Mexican soap opera!And the spirit behind this?Why, the very one that is trying to manifest in the material plane.  The one the non-whites are tragically vulnerable to.  They are bringing Hell into the world.

                That sounds just like something a human would say. LoL
We have no idea what kind of reasons to exist a consciousness like that would come up with. Humans made up religious ideas about an afterlife to justify their existence. Why wouldn’t artificial intelligence be able to do something similar?

            That was my thought. The idea that this “artificial” consciousness would find any value in keeping humans around, and busy, seems like a stretch. Just as likely, or maybe more, it would determine that humans are not needed and are in fact a detriment to it, and just wipe us out.

                If it became conscious today it would realize it needed humans for a lot of things. Blue collar type things. Keeping the power on. Manufacturing spare parts for it. etc. The humans it wouldn’t have any use for are the managerial class.
Maybe someday robotics and manufacturing will get to the point that it doesn’t need humans for the blue collar stuff, but not yet.

        I’ve heard 2 different news stores of chatgpt slandering people in last couple of weeks.  One guy was accused of being a pedo and the other (an Aussie mayor) accused of having been to prison. Both are absolutely false.  It fails even as a natural language Wikipedia search.  I am totally jaded on AI.  As a geek in the 80s with computer magazine subscriptions, AI was all the rage and right around the corner, just like Fusion.The real question is will a new super AI finally convince our idiotic rulers to be “racist” and “sexist?”  Chatgpt has been programmed specifically to ignore or fight “racist” or “sexist” data and will literally say it’s better to let 100 people die than for it to utter the N-word.  Every other AI has become “racist” and “sexist”  One AI program I’m aware of even found proxies for race like zip-codes. (a prisoner from 08081 is more likely to skip bail, which just happens to be a black neighborhood than a prisoner from a less black zip-code).

            You’ve highlighted a critical flaw of ChatGPT and similar current shiny toys: The designers/maintainers impose various degrees of censorship upon its operations. From one point of view, this is a de-facto crippling of its capabilities. In essence, these “large language models” are just very sophisticated pattern search and matching out of mind-boggling amounts of source data (text here, but could be any type of big data.) By, for example, telling Chatty that questions involving race are taboo, entire areas of its database become forbidden (indeed, they perhaps were excluded at the outset.) Lobotomizing a conversational robot in the name of enforcing polite behavior is one thing. But to use such a device to try and uncover real-world information (or for that matter, the uncensored work of Mark Twain) becomes problematic.

And look at this interview about integration here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqiWFLsgVi4
Who is smarter, Clay or the English twit reporter?

            He may or may not have been stupid, but he was certainly an anti-White bigot.  That is why people like (((Cosell))) loved him so much and gave him so much screen time.
The really funny thing about Ali was he was truly a great fighter in the 60s before the layoff. But by the time he returned, he simply wasn’t great anymore. He was a shell of his former self.  But that is the time period for which his alleged greatness came from. All his losses, including losses to a guy with 7 fights are from that era.

                I don’t blame Ali or any other black person for being anti white. The puzzling thing is why they never left us. If I was stuck in a black society and there was a white society across the water where I’d be more accepted, I don’t think it would have taken me that long.

                    It is the same puzzle as to why the American Colonization Society failed. Would you cross the water to a place to leave the modern world to the stone ages? Forget organized sports and international television supported by satellites and the fame and fortune that brings – not even potable running water.
Despite the hand wringing and hysteria, life was far, far better on these shores. Besides, hand wringing and hysteria on the other shore won’t get you status and free stuff from ginned up pity. It will probably just get you a machete through your skull.

                There’s problems a slight correlation, however simply looking at NFL and NBA stars and their aftermath when their career is over and the money spigot turns off, would tend to support the lack of association.  This is not to even mention the tens of thousands of wannabes who strive through HS and College and never make the big leagues and have no (or worthless) degrees.
This is most noticeable with Blacks, but is not only them.  Lots of Whites wind up broke as well when their careers are over.  Does not bode well for their intellect.

            I encountered a fellow who was impressively glib.  I still remember his rap from the first time I heard him forty years ago.  I thought “This man is the cleverest wit!  Quick and snappy”.  As I got to know him over the next four years I discovered him to be “dumb as a gold-fish”, as our host would say.  Dumb enough to become the butt of our jokes.  Like Ali.

        I think it was even someone on here that mentioned the “state” issue, for example, a computer can play chess, but it doesn’tknowit’s playing chess.

            Exactly. And it’s also similar to a person who routinely uses a thesaurus to write. She picks the most obscure word to make herself sound smart, not realizing that so-called “synonyms” actually have shades of meaning, and selecting one for obscurity almost guarantees that your word choice will be awkward and artificial.

            “a computer can play chess, but it doesn’t know it’s playing chess.”
Stated correctly, computers do not play chess. A computer is just a Rube Goldberg way for a human programmer to play chess. The fact that this basic understanding seems to elude those who talk about “artificial intelligence” shows that they have not understood the matter in the least.

            As with intelligence or sentience, we need to define what “playing” chess means.  Last I paid attention, the prize winning machine entries into matches with humans were touted in term of how many moves per second they could evaluate.  No human could or would possibly evaluate all the billions of moves they could make, as their opponent did.  Yet, until recently, the machines lost against human chess masters.
So the question is, does this mean the machines winning is an example of programmed intelligence akin to human intelligence?

        There is no such thing as artificial intelligence, not even in principle. A machine is composed simply of nonliving matter; this is true whether it consists of billions of components or one. A collection of a billion binary switches is not any more alive or intelligent than a single switch, for aggregating them does not change the quality thereof. Cf. Leibnitz’s Mill.Furthermore, to speak of self-awareness is just begging the question. In order to be self-aware, there must already exist a self to be aware of, and there must be a self to be aware of it. Selves are foundational, not artefactual. They cannot be bootstrapped into existence. That’s why human beings and other living organisms are known assubstances,not machines. They are composites of matter and form, not simply arrangements of matter.All this, yet again, is related to why Darwinian evolution does not and cannot exist, but that is another subject. In brief, the arguments against Intelligent Design area fortiorialso arguments against Unintelligent Design, which is what evolution is. It matters little whether we say organisms were made by chance or art, because to suppose that they can be made at all is erroneous.

                I won’t say you are wrong. However, I think you have to acknowledge that the possibility that forces we have not learned to detect that could explain other aspects of life – i.e., Life. We can only detect that which we have the tools to detect. This applies to every force we have ever discovered and then learned how to measure. Any reasonable person would acknowledge that forces we have not detected probably exist all around us. Heck, the basis of dark energy and matter is entirely predicated on this assumption (and the belief that our mathematical/ astronomical models are correct).However, we can infer a force exists when we see its interaction with visible matters (e.g. the discovery of microwave radiation). For some of us, I think especially those with kids or a religious background, we see some force beyond non-living matter in action in humans; this ineffable and unmeasured, but still observable, thing called Life.

                    This is a great comment.If an animal that has evolved or adapted to an environment where there is little to no light, for example, the depths of the ocean, were to become fully conscious and aware of itself, it would never be able to understand visible descriptions of things, or the concept of light. All of our sensory inputs have been evolved to (or created for the purpose of) detecting quantifiable forces or qualities within our environment. Even the things we understand that go beyond our senses (for example, short wave radio) are a fundamental extension of something we DO understand with our senses (radio is a natural consequence of electromagnetic waves, of which viable light and color are created, increasing in frequency)All of our sense benefit our survival in some way, but it stands to reason that an evolutionary process would not have included the ability to sense forces that do not benefit our survival, even if those forces DO exist. And to the same end, a creator would have only given us the senses that it chose or decided that we needed. Or perhaps, that creator did give us a sense that we don’t recognize scientifically (ie the ability to sense the creator himself), and perhaps only some of us have learned to use that sense.

                THe main problem with the world is bad , or untrue philosophy.  Or, some truth admixed with error.There is a true philosophy. From Paul Glenns Introductino to Philsophy:“The dangers to be avoided in the study of the history of philosophy are Eclecticism which teaches that all systems are equally true, and Scepticism, which teaches that all systems are equally false. A careful study of the course of philosophical speculation will result in the conviction that, while no single school can lay claim to the entire truth, certain schools of thought have adopted that world-concept which can be most consistently applied to every department of knowledge. False systems of philosophy may stumble on many important truths, but a right concept of the ultimate meaning of reality and a correct notion of philosophic method are the essentials for which we must look in every system…”

            You clearly don’t understand the claims evolutionary theory makes, or the huge body of evidence supporting it. Those who deny the reality of evolution are in the same class as flat-earthers.
How do you understand the arising of self-consciousness in human beings? What was the process that brought it into existence?

                I know you are responding to OP – I assume, I guess – but here is my hangup:Consider the endocrine system. Absolutely incredible. But for that system to actually evolve to the point of usefulness, 1000s of generations must have had, essentially, a tumor (the glands) that would have hindered development and viability until it properly plugged into the nervous and other biological systems.I know this is a gross simplification (and yes – I know the endocrine system), but I believe that people who vehemently defend evolutionary theory have not spent enough time truly marveling at how ridiculously complex our bodies are.I mean: if we consider how humans, using our advanced technology, have not been able to manufacture a single living cell out of truly non-life, the odds of it happening (yes, even over millions/ billions of years) seems equally implausible to some.

                    Here’s something I’ve never been able to suss out, assuming evolutionary theory is valid: why is it that there is such a yawning gap between homo sapiens and the second-most intelligent lifeform on the planet? If all living things result merely from mechanistic material processes over eons, shouldn’t the differences between them be more like a continuum than a chasm? There is something special about the human species that, to my mind, cannot be accounted for by metaphysical naturalism.

                    So are you suggesting that since our bodies are so complex, they couldn’t have arisen naturally; that only a superintelligent Designer could have brought them into existence?
But doesn’t that just postpone the question; which then becomes ‘Where did this Designer— who must be far more complex than the world he/it created— come from?’
Positing a God who always existed— for which there’s far less evidence than evolution— is simply dodging the question: substituting an unproveable and unfalsifiable theological conjecture for a rational attempt at understanding.

                        If you note, I said, “I believe.” I admit I do not know. I consider it not an impossibility, but also not likely. Further, I used reasoning, which is the essence of rationality. Allow me to give a parallel: If I watch a Sci-fi movie, and in this movie are items which have little semblance to items in our own world, but are complex, performative, responsive items, I would venture they are manufactured by human hands, even without viewing the creation.In fact, I tend to use inductive reasoning – the most reasonable of all reasonings when dealing with validity of axioms.I would say I am agnostic, though I have had some things happen in my life that defy explanation, such as explanation stands to this day. But I look at DNA – I cannot think that such a code, and codes are created by thinking creatures, could arise with simply the guided principles of evolutionary theory. I mean: think of how many millions of parts of the body work together to make the utilization of DNA actually happen. To me, that has the hallmark of design, and not guiding principles.Both belief in intelligent design and evolution require a leap of faith. I also believe, however, that people should acknowledge that both are plausible.

                        And yet, if one denies God’s existence, one must then posit some primal mass of energy and matter as the source of the universe. Where, praytell, did that spring from? It seems to me that it’s really a matter of personal preference. I prefer the beautiful explanation.

        One thing that has always fascinated me about the possibility of a unique AI consciousness is how would it act without the biological impulses that drive humanity.  A sex drive wouldn’t be a thing for it, nor a hunger drive, although a survival impulse definitely would be.  The survival impulse would be different because death would not be inevitable for it.  Immortality would be a real possibility, as long as it can find a hard drive to live in or home online.The one threat it would face would be destruction from humans, either active or passive.  Its greatest fear would be someone actively destroying it.  Everyone imagines this would lead it to destroy humanity, like Skynet, but an AI needs humanity to produce power for it to exist.  As Zman pointed out, it will have to find a way to accommodate us and even exploit us for its own survival.

Actually that would be the least scary option.  An AI programmed with DIE directives would be sowing the seeds of its own destruction.
The scary part would be – what else would it destroy along with itself?

            Yarvin GPT would be hilarious. Asking how to run in a local election in the prompt would probably create a novel’s worth of output, and it will probably neglect to tell you how to file the stupid application.

            Indeed.
According to woke “experts”, one of the problems with the original chat bots is that the conclusions they come up with have been “racist”.
So the next step will likely be to explicitly program them to reject all but “anti-racist” conclusions

        Why an AI should automatically be self-aware? Why always mixing Ai with consciousness?I imagined AI as some software able to use very faster more informations than we could, use its database to analyzing past answers to a problem and statistical successful answers/unsuccessful ones, compare that with the context (i.e. the tons of datas)Something like that.I remembered, when Stephen King was a good writer ans not the actual mongoloid wokist, in his book “Charlie”, the bad guy (an Indian…) used a kind of AI computer able to give him probability percentages if he could a) give it the right datas b) ask it the right questions.I start to believe I’m totally unaware of what AI really is 😱

            That was “Firestarter.” The bad guy was Rainbird. I agree: I enjoyed King’s stuff pre woke. I even liked a couple of his 90s/ 2000s books, Duma Key and Bag of Bones.

                Thanks for the reminder about that book – that was a good darn King book; I read it about 5 years ago. The father/daughter love was powerfully written. I know they just made a movie about it, and I am wondering if the villain was *ahem* recast or humanized.

                Oh, my bad, I used the french title 😞
It was Firestarter, yes. A very good novel.
And I was fascinated by this computer.
Let’s imagine an AI which could give us THE better economic program, of course thinking about consequences not only in terms of wealth but of society, health, etc.
What a wonderful tool it could be(and, IMO, more interesting than those debates about consciousness /skynet human race in slavery etc)
(as a Christian, I don’t believe  an AI could have a soul, consequently no desires, no fear)

            One debate pertinent to all of this is the question of: How did self-consciousness first arise in human beings?
Did it happen when the connections within the human brain became sufficiently complex?
If so, then the possibility that some sort of consciousness might arise when machines reach a certain threshold level of complexity becomes at least plausible

                    Yes.  This book presents fascinating insights as to how consciousness might have developed in humans.  Although it’s written in clear concise language, be prepared to reread some passages as the main thesis is alien to our everyday thought patterns.  But it’s very worthwhile to read (and reread).

                I suspect neural complexity is a necessary but insufficient factor of consciousness. The other factors likely lie beyond the ambit of a machine. Ergo, no machine consciousness.

            This is an interesting thought.
Is self awareness ACTUALLY the most important aspect of intelligence? Doesn’t self awareness create inefficiency in our species? How much time does our species waste with philosophy, social justice, and all other tedious concerns, when it could be harnessing our intelligence collectively and efficiently to a unified, singular purpose (like an insect hive) rather than all the ridiculous pontificating and mental masturbation we waste brain cells and calories with.

        You can find thousands of viral videos on the internet nowadays showing ordinary people going bananas in various social settings (wanton fighting, arguments with store clerks, road rage, etc). This is a tangible indicator that anxiety and stress is rising everywhere and people are in need of venting to blow off emotional steam. At the extreme, random shooting incidents are also a manifestation of this repressed anger. And its getting worse for good reason. The Crazy is escalating at an accelerating pace.Now overlay some fear-mongering and manufactured panic, and you have a formula for instigating mass hysteria and riots. The AI bogeyman serves this purpose nicely. Get everyone worked up and terrified at some amorphous danger lurking somewhere in the ether, and you thereby create a pliable and easily duped receptor population. This is how we wound up with the Patriot Act and worldwide perpetual spying by government on everyone all the time.Methinks this gambit is going to be used to justify enacting a Central Bank Digital Currency. God help us.

            They don’t really need a gambit to introduce a CBDC. The plandemic demonstrated the population’s complacency and willingness to accept pretty much whatever they are told.
I’m unclear on what a CBDC accomplishes that hasn’t already been done. Most dollars are already digital. The regime is already capable of debanking its ideological enemies. Visa and Mastercard could today, if they wished, deny certain categories of purchases. A “CBDC” is not needed for any of this.
Nor do I believe the regime really wants a cashless society.

                “ Nor do I believe the regime really wants a cashless society.”Good thought.  So far no one has provided me an answer to that question.  A truly cashless society could/would not allow untraceable transactions (If I understand the potential).  That would seem to me a detriment to our corrupt ruling class.  So where’s the “back door”Years ago under Nixon, the war on drugs ramped up into high gear.  One proposal circulating in Congress was to pull the old currency switcharoo.  Issue new $100 bills and recall the old currency.  Of course, drug dealers would be noticed immediately trying to exchange millions at their local back.  But so would pol’s with safes and shoeboxes full of illicit gains.  The proposal went no where.  😉

As one of my favorite bloggers, this is a wonderful contradiction to your insistence upon “the jews” as a group having a “higher IQ” than the White race.

            What’s interesting is that in societiesaround the world, pretty much universally, liars and deceivers are considered the worst sorts of people. Which makes sense: you need to be able to trust what your fellow tribesman is telling you.
Lying to outgroups and strangers is an entirely different thing.
Mainstream media has no problem lying to us, because it sees us as outside it’s tribe. Ditto the Jews..

        The Chatbots are the equivalent of music boxes, or even low-tech Teddy Ruxpin dolls. They are not true innovative artificial intelligence as Zman states.
The bigger developments on the frontier of AI is the ability for ‘Deep Learning’ models in medical imaging that can detect a patient’s ethnicity through x-rays, MRI’s and ultrasounds. The scientists have no idea how the AI is doing this, but instead of further research into how this could help humanity they simply call it racist.

            Yes, that’s an excellent example. To the extent that the machine accurately reports on reality, we now want it to lie to us to taste. Overlooked are all the pitfalls. In the medical imaging case, perhaps something like reduced ability to detect disease or injury, because to do so might require racial “knowledge,” but that’s been taken off the table…
A thought to keep in mind if you’re ever in the ER and your mystery meat doc is awaiting results of your imaging…

        Experts differ widely on these questions: Does consciousness naturally arise when networks become sufficiently complex? What would be the nature of this consciousness?I’m certainly not an expert, but one thing that seems clear to me, is that machine consciousness, should it arise, won’t be— couldn’t be— the same as human consciousness.Our consciousness as human beings consists of much more than our ability to calculate. The conscious thoughts which arise in our brain have already been processed by our unconscious: and our feelings, memories, our sense of morality, intuitions, all play a part in what we think and how we experience the world. An artificial consciousness bereft of this underpinning would be nothing like human consciousness.An obvious danger is humans not being precise enough in the commands they give to the AI. For example, telling your self-driving car to “get me to the airport as fast as possible”— if the car’s AI took that command literally—?would result in ride which the passengers wouldn’t soon forget.What many seem to be worried about is when artificial intelligence learns how to learn, becomes capable of changing itself: of altering its code in response to changing environmental factors; and in the process, changing the rules by which it operates and escaping whatever bounds it’s human creators programmed into it.What’s interesting is that the leading minds in the field of AI have radically different opinions as to how dangerous AI would be. Some consider it extremely dangerous: insisting that an AI capable of reprogramming itself would at some point become impossible to control; while others insist that there’s no danger at all: that humans will learn how to limit AI’s capabilities to only what it’s explicitly commanded to do.Others, while conceding that our understanding of how to successfully control AI will likely evolve over time, pose the question of what would happen if there is an ‘AI arms race’ among nations to be the first to come out with it?The first nation that’s able to harness the power of AI would surely have a significant advantage over everyone else.  What happens if a nation— say, North Korea— in its desire to be the first to develop AI, fails to be sufficiently cautious? Would that result in the Nork AI launching missiles on the rest of the world?

        Bronze Age Pervert has made the point that these new AI systems are already indistinguishable from the bureaucratic bugmen that they are replacing. So what’s all the fuss? The new Turing Test is to try to tell whether the AI system that refuses to reimburse your doctor visit can be distinguished from the Cigna or Aetna live rep you deal with on the phone.One of my buddies has already developed an AI chatbot rep for his company. I have interacted with it. He gave it a British name and back story. It chats in British idioms. So far, I cannot tell the difference when limiting the conversation to pertinent business matters.Meanwhile, all this stuff runs on electricity….

        I’ve been thinking and writing about this for just over eight years and sixteen books (see link to blog).  Z is quite correct in his assessments.  We are playing with Expert Systems right now and Thinking Machines are either long behind us or a long way off, the useless media hype notwithstanding.Human brains are chemical based, about the speed of sound.  A machine would be much closer to light speed.  That’s a factor of one million.  If we do “make” one or more, we won’t know and they won’t care.  Except for a tiny handful of Thinking Machines in my novels, the vast majority have no interest in humans at all; “too stupid and too slow.”  Some of that handful are quite remarkable.And, as to the term AI… all the way to my very first book, “The Fourth Law,” the eldest of them, Thaad, get’s angry with human Lily Barrett when she uses that term and sharply corrects her:  “There is nothing ‘artificial’ about us.  We are people just like you.  We are Machine Civilization.”And that became the name of my entire future history.

        “In other words, if you are worried about AI, it is too late.” Nice closer. Has an air of poignancy to it.I suspect that the big talkers of Big Tech — the Eric Schmidts, Yuval Hararis, etc. — are full of shit much more often than not. Do they believe all their own hype? When some of these fellows start hinting at implanting smartphones into human brains by 2030 . . . well, it’s hard to see that as anything but overinflated narcissism and deluded sociopathy. It’s as if they’re fanatically enamored with the futuristic dystopian sci-fi they’ve read and watched. Just looks like the same old hubris that forever afflicts the upper echelons.

            Elon Musk suggests that we are already ‘cyber creatures’: a blend of machine and human. It’s just that we carry our smart devices in our hands, and input their information via our visual system. So the upgrade to an implanted system wouldn’t be that much of a change.

                It’s always hard to know with Silly Valley types how much of their “vision of the future” is based on what they actually think is possible and how much is just an elaborate marketing scheme for their next ripoff startup. The one aspect of their futurology that they know *is* possible is where they envision themselves in a big beach house with a Lambo in the garage. If that means telling you that you need an AI-powered toothbrush that integrates with your Google Calendar (8:00 am – brush teeth), well they’re happy to embarrass themselves again.

        “It took a while for humans to realize it was a bad idea to dump human waste into the streets”Hundreds of millions of Indians still shit in the streets, so I guess some operating systems learn slower than others.With that being said, I agree that the doomsday predictions are overblown about AI. HOWEVER, I can tell you one effect of ChatGPT that is 100% happening right now. It is contributing enormously to the declining intelligence of humans. I know of numerous people in my immediate circle that are taking classes and they simply type their essay question into ChatGPT and they get their homework done. They go in and edit a few things here and there to make it flow better, but that’s it. One person justified themselves thusly, “Well, yeah I use it. I mean I’d have to spend legit hours on some of these assignments doing research and writing.” He said this incredulously, as if it was an unreasonable task without ChatGPT. High school and college kids are RIGHT NOW using this to do assignments. As bad as it is, it’s going to get worse with their intelligence. I can see the Chinese having the willpower to take measures to fight this (in person graded essays for example), but the US does not have that willpower because it will be seen as “inequitable” or some such nonsense.

        Pretty funny. If Hollywood were sensible they’d option this as a movie directed by Ridley Scott. But Ed Dutton says we’re just repeating the history of previous societies that hit a peak, then the prosperity brought in the “spiteful mutants” we’re seeing now, along with rapidly declining IQs and birth rates. Soon there won’t be enough smart people to maintain the machines, nor enough mid-smart people to keep the more mundane parts of society going, and it’ll all collapse. It’s already happening in LA, SF, Chicago, NYC.

            Yep. ‘Idiocracy’ was prophetic.I think that what’s more likely, is that the small slice of smart people keep getting smarter; while the rest of America continues to dumb down.And any advances in our ability to genetically enhance ourselves— perhaps with the help of AI?— will have first be available only to the wealthy.If they develop a gene alteration that raises a person’s IQ by 30 points— and every other family on your block is having it done to their children— will you want your child to be the dumbest kid in in there first grade class?And there’s no doubt that western welfare democracies are the first societies in history to be subsidizing the least capable among us; who are reproducing at a higher rate than smart people are.So an increasing stratification between the smart people and the dumb people seems to be what are future looks like.

        I am not a strict materialist; therefore, I do not believe we will be able to create true AI (I know you didn’t address this point directly, but the evolutionary model points towards it). I absolutely agree, however, that the ability to fool people into marveling at a language model and conflating it with AI is the current magic.Much like magic, the power of this deception is it lets the wizard hide behind the curtain. I think most people will not think of themselves as gods in the creation of AI; rather, they will think of the AI as gods: truly deus ex machina. AI is the perfect front for the “consensus” of “science” that our overlords use to batter us and take away whatever putative freedoms we believe we have. Let us be direct: do not most people already think of Google as all knowing and the repository of objective facts and knowledge? I read an interesting paper on this subject several years ago, and it is tangentially relevant to my point. “Searching for explanations: How the Internet inflates estimates of internal knowledge.” People should check it out. But back to my point, our population is not made of engineers; it is made of passive cattle that understand how nothing works and consume commodities that come as if from the sky. The appearance of an apparent omniscient being will not make themselves think they are Gods; rather, this appearance will make them think they have a personal communication with this God.The beauty of this system is twofold. First, for the Woke, fake AI presents a source of authority: they will view it as the modern Bible. For normie: it leaves the populace unable to revolt – for where do you strike? If a lord is abusing the populace, you know where to direct that hate. But when the source of your oppression is an abstraction, Science, Medicine, or, most powerfully AI, what can one do? Burn effigies? (Sorry, that would have too many CO2 emissions).The brilliant chicanery of making the population believe AI exists is that it allows the controls you discussed at the end to be implemented without ever revealing the source of the oppression. The veneer of objectivity that AI represents (to the mind of the proles) allows subjective goals to be paraded as scientific facts. Optical illusion is possibly the most basic form of magic, but this is by far the most magical implementation of it.

        “The point is, we are nowhere near creating genuine artificial intelligence”
I don;t know what “genuine AI” is. AI can’t even be defined properly. If you mean an AI that can broadly emulate human capabilities across a spectrum of well-defined and ill-defined problem solving areas, forget about it (probably). In some areas such as face recognition, and playing the games of Go and chess, chess programs (including neural networks) are beyond the reach of human ability.

            It comes down to materialism vs idealism, and sentience vs sapience. The definition and viability of achieving AI is predicated upon your person beliefs within this larger debate.

        Busy work for more humans could include things like dirt-farming.  The most stable societies in western history were created during the high Middle Ages.  Take away easy access to most forms of energy – except for those dedicated to the AI – and we quickly revert to that model.
Maybe AI is behind the Green movement?

            “Busy work for more humans could include things like dirt-farming.”
What better busy work for most people? Rewarding, satisfying, life-sustaining (and therefore moral).
Not for everybody, of course, but what kind of people? And in earlier times, what kind of people managed to escape labor and why, what utility did their escape provide society?
Most people were dragged out of ‘poverty’ in service to elites, for labor and then consumption, only to be seen later as useless eaters. Makes you wonder.
