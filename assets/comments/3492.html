        If drugs are legal, at least they can then be taxed and the resultant revenue used to discourage use and treat those who continue their self-abuse.  With a black market, no such thing is possible. The revenues all go to the goblins or those who make a little side vig helping the goblins along: Cops, judges, prosecutors, all the usual suspects. Would rather see a bunch of sociology majors gainfully employed helping the rabble than crooked judges taking posh vacations!

        I’ve had a couple of females demonstrate that “chaotic sense of entitlement” at intersections. Suddenly redlining a sportbike when they’re two feet in front of you is guaranteed to brighten your commute.One of them was white, btw. She thought she could walk into my path while I was rounding a corner and I’d have to stop. Well, you can’t stop a bike when it’s leaned over like that, but you can just barely avoid the collision. She jumped a foot in the air just like the other one.Silly, I know, but I feel like civilized people shouldn’t take it lying down.

        Depending on what you mean by “ghetto”, I guess. Certain areas of even small towns are “ghetto” – if you mean primarily black, and walking down the middle of the damn street at all hours of the day and night.
I discovered that leaving a bunch of rubber at the stop signs tends to move them to the sides of the road fairly quickly. I only did that when I was drinking heavily, though, so I reckon it doesn’t count.
