        From the NYT article, first her version, next his/their versions of what happened at the frat house:1) …..she began to talk about what had happened at Kappa Sigma: She was in a room with several boys and girls who left her alone with the football player; three times she refused his request for sex; two other football players entered the room, and she was sexually assaulted.2) The senior player said Anna had given him a lap dance behind the fraternity bar. Upstairs, he said, she kissed him and then performed oral sex on him for two to three minutes. However, he said, he could not get an erection because he was tired from playing football and “a super long bus ride.”The second football player said that while his teammate was in the room, Anna pulled down his pants and gave him oral sex. “I didn’t consent,” he said. “She’s doing it all by herself. My hands are not touching her.” After a brief period, he said, he told her to stop. “I zippered my pants up, put my belt on, and I walked out the door.”

        “Around midnight” the gal in the story was, of her own volition, in a locked bedroom, half naked, and “around midnight” she was also using her cell phone to text her friend.  Sounds like she was sober enough to know what she was doing, with some trepidation over what she had gotten herself into.  When the door to the locked bedroom opened, that was her opportunity to flee or to call for help; for whatever reason, she did not take advantage of the interruption. How she subsequently got from the frat house to the dance hall in her inebriated state is an open question. Was it voluntary or was it kidnap?This is an unwise “adventure” that was sought out but unfortunately ended badly, yet could have been avoided by the exercise of just the tiniest bit of discretion.

        If the girl were a intoxicated black stripper maybe someone of consequence would have taken her story seriously.

        I have never understood the urge — bordering on compulsion — in today’s youth to lose all control of their body and many of its functions as soon as possible. I was once told by someone that this person had a great weekend because they woke up in the gutter lying in their own vomit and mess. Apparently this was the true mark of ‘having a great time.’
As he was male, I presume he may well avoided anyone sodomizing him though he probably wouldn’t have remembered.

        That should have been (pre-’72).

        I almost never heard of these sorts of assaults in HS or college (&gt;’72). I did hear of a few that were stopped in progress.
The perps weren’t just stopped, they were attacked and hurt, sometimes pretty badly, just as they were supposed to be. We called that “ending well”.

        Not just that, but nowadays if you looked out for the girl, you’d get it from the feminazi’s on how you’re slut shaming the girl, enforcing the patriarchy etc.

        Stupidity is evidently a right. Taking advantage of stupidity is a crime, I guess. Tales of gang-bangs were always around when I was in HS and college. I always HEARD about them, but never was around when it was going on, so I don’t know if it was male BS, you know? The whole idea of such a thing sorta turned my stomach.
If that makes me sound gay, so be it.

            Back in the horse and buggy era, I was at a party where a young girl was clearly in over her head. She had just moved up from Arkansas to the big city. Her roommate asked me and a friend to keep an eye on her to make sure none of the guys took advantage of her. At one point she was drinking from a bottle of whiskey with some guys I knew were trouble. The girl did not like it that I pulled her into another room and lectured her about getting hammered. Still, it was the right thing to do.Later, me and my buddy pulled some degenerate off her. The girl was so drunk she could not stand. We stood her up to make sure she was OK and she just fell over on her face. If we had not been trying to look out for her, it would have ended poorly for her.The point is it was not so long ago when most young men and women knew better. Within a generation or two the stupidification is near complete with terrible consequences.
