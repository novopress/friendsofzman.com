        This is all a natural part of the rise of global corporate power.  Corporations crave constant expansion of sales, which demands that they sell to the numerous black and brown and yellow and leave behind the fewer white who started the corporations.  Whether the non-whites will have the ability to generate the cash flow of the whites remains to be seen.

        Deash, the caliphate, and those running our government share something deeply in common.They are as enexstricably linked as if they where sworn allies.Neither has intrinsic legitimacy.And they are all cultural marxists of one sub species or another.Because for all their corruption and force of violence and ideology, and the illusion of power they construct, niether holds a shred of moral high ground.For either to win it is impossible, regardless of their force and violence, because it is impossible for them to obtain and hold the moral high ground.In truth in spite of it.This is where faith in God, Liberty and integrity of our primal rights and natural freedom, or virtues, and the inevitable reality we are going to have to fight and kill them all if we are to survive, makes us the most legitimate thing in all of humanity in all its history in all its action.If we overtly occupy the moral high ground first, and it is there just for the taking, we take the moral imperative in war, because this is what is happening, war plain and simple, it is then we can use force in such a way we can not be denied, we destroy the forces of tyranny, we win.PS,There is no Mosque on the hill. Its as big a lie as all the rest of this pogrom against Christianity and the values it espouses.

        Am visiting a distant city and after Thanksgiving dinner watched the abysmal Chicago – Packers Game. At home I never watch Football in real time as a DVR permits skipping ads. Not this time, we were forced to view the ads and saw miscegenation encouraged and white guys disparaged repeatedly. I was nauseated and discussed it with my wife at breakfast. She usually does not agree with me on things of this nature but not today as she was shocked as well.This morning I was surfing the Internet and was disgusted when I watched two YouTube videos where the President of Princeton accepted a dressing down by a room full of affirmative action Black “students” demanding that Woodrow Wilson, the dead racist white male of nearly 100 years ago, be expunged from the Ivy. The Princeton president appeared to be spineless. He seemed to be ready to roll over to their demands. Did he?  The blacks were snapping their fingers throughout the surreal episode.At some point there will be a backlash as I can not imagine this continuing. Tell me I am wrong.Dan KurtSent from my iPad

        The Zman is right. The Pilgrims that came over on the Mayflower were *not* persecuted for their religion. That is a myth that keeps getting repeated over and over.The pilgrims were Puritans. What they espoused was a religion that in their minds had been “purified” of all vestiges of Catholicism, and they wanted everyone in their community to be just like them. Unfortunately for them, the majority in England were Anglican (Church of England) or Presbyterian, which according to the puritans, still had too many rites and ceremonies left over from the Catholic church. The laws in England at the time would allow them to practice their religion, but would not allow them to take over towns and form exclusive communities like they wanted. So they moved – first to Holland, and then to the new world. For a hundred years after the founding of the Massachusetts Bay colony, it was the puritans that were the persecutors. Anyone who ran afoul of the religious authorities during this time could be punished with penalties ranging from the stocks, to scarlet letters, to imprisonment, or even execution. (…see Salem witch trials.) It was this heavy handedness that eventually led some in their communities to break away and form their own colonies. (Providence Plantation i.e Rhode Island, and Connecticut.)

        Except that the Pilgrims were fleeing from persecution, while the Moslems cause it the world over.

            They Pilgrims were fleeing tolerance. They could have stayed in Holland. They just hated being around all those other people and their diversity and tolerance. The Puritans were intolerant fanatics.

                True, but in their mind they were fleeing persecution, just like the Moslems. Moslems always consider themselves persecuted if they are not the dominant ideology, and constantly work to amend the situation. Hence the political agitation, suing to assert “rights”, then finally stabbing people, bombings, supposedly random shootings, and beheadings. The pattern is always the same.

                In early New England when enough people could no longer stand the brand of intolerance of the in group they picked up and moved a few miles to found another town, and so on. John Williams even carved out a state for that purpose in 1636. It was impossible to  harang people who weren’t there anymore. That difficulty  has since been solved. There is no escape.

        All of the media now is devoted to pushing an agenda that white is done. So much so that, in the example of television, it is very hard to see say a family of pale  people. They now have to be black, brown, yellow or preferably mixed race and so very happy with it. Even ads for sofas have a black man and a white woman being happy sat on them, perhaps suggesting they will soon be putting it in their home and before long all their cute little mixed-race children can bounce on it happily. The BBC here — which isn’t supposed to show ads but continually promotes its ‘services’ — likes to feature gay couples worrying about their TV licence payments.I started to watch the TV series ‘Jessica Jones’ but soon stopped. Seeing a lesbian married couple suing for divorce (oh, how love can be so fickle) and repeated scenes of a black man humping a white woman combined with poor writing and mediocre acting (though in fairness the plot is less use to the liberal mindset than the ‘messages’) quickly made me turn it off. My, how funny it was when the bed broke because they were just so super powerful!It shouldn’t matter of course, because we all know TV is just moving wallpaper. Yet it does nag at us. Years ago a friend of mine called television ‘necessary compost’ and perhaps he was correct, but he used to write for TV and if he still does all this time later, would he now feel obliged to write a scene with a black man and a white woman rolling round in the compost?

            I think a lot of it is just in-group signalling. The people making the ads and writing the shows want to show their peers just how pious they are so they keep reaching for more extreme examples. The result is normal people watch this bizarre piety contest through their televisions. But, proselytizing is a part of it too. They can’t feel completely one with the great spirit force knowing there are disbelievers out there in the hinterlands.I don’t know about the UK, but mixed marriage is still rare here, despite the campaigns. You rarely see a white man with a black women. You do see white women with black men on occasion. Divorced rates for mixed race couple is staggeringly high among black-white couple, but very low among white-yellow. Jungle fever, it seems, fades, while yellow fever has some permanence.

            Have  you noticed that nearly all mixed-race couples on TV are black man – white woman?  You hardly ever see white man – black woman.  I really think that is because of the sensitivities of black men.

                I have to say here that a relative of mine (a normal, sports playing and very nice white male) is married to a black female. From the odd times I have met them I can see the man is happy, the children are a delight and the mother… well, somewhat lazy though according to other relatives more familiar with their situation she is gradually improving her attitude. Sadly she will still post frantic and ill-advised social media messages about injustice and even, though she is not American, loves Obama. I have, successfully so far, avoided telling her the man is a fraud and liar and there are nowhere as many injustices in the world as the ‘victims’ would have you believe.Perhaps in time the lady will come to realise all those things by herself, but I do think at times her husband has to be very tolerant to remain happy, and fortunately for her she lives in a remarkably tolerant society.

                    Yes, I have two white friends — both men — married to black women. My point is that this is not reflected on tv, at least not in America. In tv, the mixed race couple is nearly always a non-white man. I can think of only one exception.

                        You are right, Dom: our media and ‘experts’  have the world, as we say in England, arse over tits.
We, who aren’t in the media, have a chance to see the world just as it is, not as can be pretended or wished for.
