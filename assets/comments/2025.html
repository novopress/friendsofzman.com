        “The nitwit we have in the White House now makes Clinton look like genius.”
Nice try but wrong premise. Obama is doing exactly what he said. Fundamental transformation. But no one asked to what? Did they?
You thought he said “Hope &amp; Change”, he said “Rope &amp; Chains”.

        Then there was Dinesh D’Souza who did a good job of explaining Obama’s motivations. I bought several copies of his Documentary “2016 Obama’s America” and passed them around.  A good effort. A thought with which he can console himself as he does the maximum time for a “crime” that no one else has ever gone to prison for.But he’s not sentenced yet you say, care to put some money down on that?On Iraq, missing Saddam Hussein yet? In hindsight, obviously in him Iraq got the leader it wanted, or deserved. Maybe we had to slap his hand when it tried to grab something off someone else’s  table but he was dependable.  Maybe it would have been cheaper to put him back on the payroll?

        No one saw this coming? Really?I seem to remember Glen Beck had chalk boardsoutlining “the players”, and depicting where the Middle East would be “on fire”.Of course, he was mocked for it, by “experts” who used to have a job, or an audience.

        With respect, I strongly suggest you consider the *other* possibility in the
“is he stupid or evil?”
question.  He was born and bred for malice.
