        It is true that Americans tend to condescend towards Canadians what with their being so much smaller and less consequential a nation in comparison and feeling somewhat guilty to acknowledge such condescension, but the canucks voted 71% for the progressives.  That is a whole lot of stupidity.  Even the dumb low information American voter never deviates more than a few percentages (from 50%) on which elections turn. The idiots up north deserve our scorn.  I hope you suffer appropriately.

            The idiot is most likely the one who thinks it amounts to a hill of beans which ever party is in power.

                Say what you want but we did not elect somebody named “Hussein”!!! EVER! Or someone who as a pilot ejected and left his crewmen to die in WW II (Papa Arbusto) Political labels do not always mean everything…remember:”Watch my lips”?I was pretty horrified when a guy from Saudi Arabia was elected premier in Quebec…Actually, I  am impressed by the performance…He is my MP here but is turning the economy around, encouraging even the Chinese to invest here in resources while the sector is collapsing everywhere.You may note that like Ben Carson, Dr Couillard is a brain surgeon too that was from here but was running large hospitals in Saudi Arabia.And it seem that Dr Carson have an excellent chance in the USA…probably with a joint ticket with the Donald…you’d have the ultimate in competence.Jeez, I may even move back to Florida!

            I just like writing “the little mushroom people of Nova Scotia.” I have no idea how they voted, but I would assume they enjoy the mushroom treatment.

        The socialist pandemic continues spreading unabated.  Otherwise, seemingly good, rational people are infected with this disease and at present there seems to be no effective treatment.  Symptoms include but are not limited to:  bankrupting one’s own economy, rewarding takers over  makers, diluting one’s own nationalistic/cultural heritage,  suppressing dissent,  feelings of superiority/grandeur.  It is advised to avoid contact with the infected and suspected carriers at all costs.  Keep your powder dry.

        Was in Alaska this summer and by chance was on a Brewery tour with four Canadians ranging from a water treatment engineer bureaucrat to a schoolteacher and two youngish workmen. They were all on a Holliday for a week on a ship out of Vancouver, B.C. The tour was little talk and much tasting and I had, if their measurements were correct, 42 oz of beer (7 six oz glasses). All of the Canadians had much more than I did, tasting all 13 taps.Well politics came up as we “learned about beer” and to man they all believed in Big Government and were at the same time complaining of the high prices they pay on everything because of the Canadian taxes but believing that there was no other political choice available. All of the four made regular trips from the Vancouver area to Bellingham, Washington to buy items in the large stores built there to cater to the Canadians as American prices were substantially less than Canadian prices for the same type of item. A more cordial group of drinking buddies one could not hope for I discovered. However, from that experience I see no hope for Canada as they are Socialist to the core.Dan Kurt

        I have relatives who reside in Canada, and from what I know of them I expect they voted for the one on the left and not the one with any sense.Well, good luck to Canada; you may need it. While it is one of the very few countries I would choose to live in were the UK not available to me (and heaven knows with our lefty-leaning politics here that may not be too far away) I expect many of the world’s less-pleasant people will all be flocking there to make a home before I get round to be forced to consider leaving Britain. But the prospect of moving to simply more of what I might be forced to leave behind is not a happy thought.

            Canada’s safety net is the weather. The third world types heading to Europe are not very good at shoveling snow. Some do it, but Canada is a lot like Finland. A place migrants consider to be punishment.

                There’s guns everywhere in north Canada to shoot mud slime dead…Will Justin re-start the gun registry? Not likely, like daddy, he like to label himself as a “sportsman”…http://thechronicleherald.ca/sites/default/files/imagecache/slideshow_image/op_image/B97359860Z.120140825170542000GRF6DIQK.11.jpg

        Tangential to your main point, I realize, but I wonder why LBJ isn’t in every conservative’s Hall of Fame of Liberal Evil. His programs were atrocious — I think most of us recognize that — but his truly vicious ad hominem style is still the gold standard for Dem campaigns today.  LBJ was one of the meanest, pettiest, most vindictive little shits in American political history, and the Dems learned his lessons very well.  He should get more credit (if that’s the word) for that.

            If you’re on “Conspiracy theories” there is a good case that LBJ killed Kennedy.

            Evil he was.  LBJ didn’t want to deal with the black leaders of the civil rights movement, but when he saw that he would have to, he crafted a devil’s deal with them.  Afterwards, LBJ is said to have remarked to one of his staffers that, “We’ll have those niggers voting Democrat for the next 100 years.”  For those of you in the Great White North, “nigger” is considered a highly offensive, derisive epithet here in the states.

                Watch out for the genetics here…Pierre was a nazi during WW II, using his family’s vast fortune to support the “Blue Shirts” of Canada’s own little Hitler, Adrien Arcand…Then after the war, he got famous for fighting the “War Measures Act” used to imprison Arcand for the war times…The exact same measures he invoked later to jail thousands of separatists who rebelled against his federal government diktats…By that time, Pierre “PET”(Pierre Elliott Trudeau) was now a communist, of course(what difference does it make?)Sonny Justin seem to be a stealth muslim himself, having professed great admiration for the terrorists, a real arbusto with his “religion of peace”…He has promised to turn Canada into a Sveeden hell of rapists and jihadi monsters…Justin have however cultivated an image of a likable fellow, if not too smart while Harper went out of his way to look like anabsolutist beady eyed bureaucrat micromanaging himself everything and maybe making sense, but making actualling nothing but enemies…As for Null Care, he was far to the left of Stevie the Berniac…So faced with three assholes, the Canadians chose the village idiot…The Medias are ecstatic…But remember that the First Thing Harper did when elected was to fire the liberal head of Radio-Canada for having said that the muslims were goat fuckers…So, the plague on him too!
