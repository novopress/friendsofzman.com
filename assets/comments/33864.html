        Z, I have to strongly disagree with you on the anonymous posting answer. Do you realize that 90% of your comment section would disappear if it wasn’t anonymous? Maybe it’s because I look at that question through the lens of dissident politics and our current regime, but posts that disagree with the establishment position on race or homosexuality can make someone lose their jobs and livelihood.

            I agree with you Greek.I remain anonymous not because what I say is incorrect.But because what I say IS correct, albeit socially taboo in clownworld.

            I did not read the question in the narrow context of recent politics. I was reading it very generally. If you can put aside the pogroms against dissident over the last decade, then my answer makes sense. Imagine a world free of crazies. Would you then be a different poster as anonymous versus your real name?

                Setting aside what is in favor of what ought to be is the libertarian/communist/utopian disease. The crazies and sociopaths will always be with us. And they will be drawn toward power, so anonymity will always be useful. They’re not going to suddenly invent a new type of human being … and if they did, that would be a whole new type of dystopia.

            It’s no just jobs and livelihood.  There were bloggers I used toread who had to quit because kids – nieces and nephews- were attacked.  The wives will be verbally confronted in the grocery store, and banned from the public school grounds (where her kids ought not to be anyhow).  It affects every family member. Heck, look at Tucker Carlson, whose DC/MD home was attacked when his wife and kids were there.  He had the money and family roots torelocate to Maine.  That state is politically a disaster, but in the more rural areas ‘down east,’ it’s still a traditional White community.

                    Seems you’re right – on Gasparilla Island.  I thought he was doing his broadcasts from Maine, but apparently the studio space was too small.  But online it does say he lives in Maine during the summer.

            The comment section is only anonymous to the extent that we are unimportant enough to not waste the resources on de-anonymizing us.One of the stupidest ideas that oldsters are bringing forward into the present is that anything on the internet can be truly anonymous if someone with sufficient resources wants to make it un-anonymous. Feel free to believe that your handle or your VPN are protecting you, but it’s only true to the extent that it’s not worth leaning on the VPNs owner to find out the identity of Joe Schmoe for saying bad thoughts in some small corner of the net.

                    I have to live in the present. I’ve been posting and writing dissident thoughts online since the 1990s. At what point does this “social credit score” actually appear in my existence, compared to the myriad other actual events that have determined the course of my life — and continue to, right now?What a will o’ the wisp. Chasing future threats while there are real ones — and have been — for decades all around us.I’ll be dying in a tent someday on the side of the road in a decade and the guy next to me will be listening to a conservative influencer podcast ranting about social credit scores coming to America to turn us into an open air prison. Oh no!

                It’s the reason I don’t bother even thinking about using a VPN any more. If you suddenly decided to start using a VPN, but you have a prior history of posts without using one, you can be identified — and you will be identified if someone or some group takes any interest. Everybody has a particular way of writing/speaking. If they could identify the UC@bomba without modern computational methods, they can identify you today using those methods, through your unique word choices.BUT… if you wanted to go anon after having a history of posting without a VPN, it might be possible to post by becoming very generic in your speech. But it might be nigh impossible to do that. You would have to vet everything closely and be very diligent, maybe by running everything through some kind of language depersonalization software.

                    On second thought, I believe it would be nigh impossible to even design such software. Something we might call one’s “concern frequency” would still offer your writings up in a unique profile.

                        Everyone has a distinctive pattern of knowledge, even idiots. If you know a lot and can maintain your characters’ boundaries, you can probably pretend to be a few separate people. They’re all going on the same list, if the listmakers (or their software) are even slightly competent.However, any closed door isalmostas secure as Fort Knox. The best investment in separating your internet self from your real self is a boring lie. In adolescence you chose the wrong deodorant and smelled super bad for a couple years, and your favorite band is Sabaton (as befits a smelly kid). Mention it twice.

                    I agree. We can all talk about how stupid AI is with things like math(and it is) but it is very good at sifting large datasets like the data packet traffic of an ISP. I suspect that a decade from now, the very idea of digital privacy/anonymity is going to be laughable.
And the Ukraine war is busily exposing how ludicrous the idea of bugging out is in a world with cheap infrared drones capable of carrying weapons. Whatever the post-apocalyptic dystopia ends up being, it won’t be like film portrays it.

                Correct. I’ve already had one attempt on my life. And I live in a remote location in the Rockies within a rural white community. As such, the invader responsible was easily recognizable. I am never unarmed now. Such is the reality we must face in this Brave New World we live in.

            If anonymous posting was good enough for Ben Franklin, it’s certainly good enough for us. Or is that another privilege reserved only for the elite?I don’t see what the problem is on these comment pages. I don’t see any problem with the comments here, but then again, I don’t know what has to be black-holed.I warn normies when I post links to articles here (that is when I am allowed to) that they may find some of the comments edgier than they like, but the author is pretty solid.I think everybody should show all their cards. Lay it all out there and may the best ideas win.

They knew how to merchandise to small towns, but not so much to big cities.

                Yep. Anonymous posting was good enough for “Publius” and “Federal Farmer” in 1787.Good for us, too.Look, we are the new samizdat. We’re the Christians in the catacombs. Sure, the government can and will find us if we get on the radar screen, but each of us is only 1 of 320 million.The virtue of anonymous posting is not that it will hide you from the government, but that it will hide you from the Stasi informants (your “fellow Americans” LOL) who will put you on the government’s radar screen.We live in a highly ideological society in which you can’t say the truth even if it is blindingly evident and in your face.A Negro just stabbed a white kid to death at a Texas high school the other day. But society requires you to kneel before the holy memory of St. George Floyd instead of speaking the plain truth that African savages routinely behave like animals and kill members of the white race over nothing.You have to be anonymous to say that, though.

                    I read a story from Torrance, California where someone didn’t tip a Hispanic waiter and wrote a note on the restaurant receipt that there are no tips for illegals and he should go back to Mexico. Someone mentioned in one of the comments that if you call the credit card company even as a third party to complain, oftentimes they will cancel that person’s account.
In other words, yes. That’s what anonymity protects us from.

        So I see everyone in the uniparty is absolutely freaking out about the tariffs. saying how bad they’re going to be for the US.
But you know the thing about tariffs? They can be removed as quickly as they were levied. Even if they are bad, the damage they can do in a few months or even years is reversible.
In my opinion, the reason they want them removed immediately isn’t because they’re afraid they won’t work. It’s because they’re afraid theywillwork.

            I have a smattering of economic background, primarily from “free market” school. The gist of these readings might be summed up as “Government intervention in economies tends to favor special interests and in general fucks things up worse than had they done nothing.” I “know” little of tariff history save that I read about the major disasters (Smoot-Hawley is blamed for exacerbating tbe Depression.) I concede that, having read only one side of the issues; I don’t know the other sides’ viewpoints.I’m also reminded of the quotes you’ll often see that, distilled to their essence, generally say that economics rapidly deteriorates into fortune-telling once you leave  the most basic stuff like supply and demand or calculating simple interest. Indeed, it’s one of the softest of the soft “sciences.”Now, back to those tariffs. One “new to me” revelation was how arbitrary they are. In this context “arbitrary” means they are largely at the President’s discretion. This is in stark contrast to most other taxes. Usually those are set by the legislature. The President can’t increase the top income tax bracket by 5% at a whim. Nor can your State Governor adjust the State sales or property tax before the legislature has weighed in. But, apparently, not so with tariffs. Of course, the legislature delineates those powers to Executive, but apparently those powers are very broad. The important lesson here is that a tariff is a very flexible tool for the Executive.One purpose of a tariff is revenue collection. Unless I’m mistaken, they were the main source of Federal income prior to the Income Tax. But they’re also a political tool, to the degree the Executive has power to manipulate them. Since politics at bottom is favoring your friends and screwing your enemies, the two non-revenue uses of tariffs are, then:(1)  To favor domestic producers. This is why sugar costs much more here than just south of the border. Domestic corporations (and their workers) in effect, enjoy a monopoly on production and sales, depending upon how punitive the tariff is. Who pays for this favoritism? The consumer, of course? While the average household probably isn’t greatly hurt by having to pay $1/Lb. for sugar instead of $0.20, what has happened is a de-facto subsidy to favored interests and a tax on those who consume the good.(2)  To favor or punish foreign nations. This probably is the main intent of the current Trump efforts. You might want to keep out the cheap goods to protect special interests, but you might also do it simply out of spite. For example, we don’t trade much with Cuba (granted, that may be due to laws other than tariffs, but a very high tariff would stringently inhibit trade) China may get higher tariffs slapped on, say, its Flat Screen TVs than would more friendly nations like Taiwan or Korea.To wrap this up, it seems likely to me that the public, and perhaps even economists, are in confusion or disagreement about the benefits of tariffs simply because as I’ve shown, they are an extremely flexible, arbitrary policy tool. As with any tool, the effect of wielding that tool depends upon the artisan’s skills, but also his intents. Any tool can be used for good or ill. A flat, rational system of tariffs probably serves as a reliable revenue source. It’d certainly make business planning easier. At the other extreme, constantly shifting arbitrary policies, as we’re seeing now, have the opposite effect. Nevertheless, an argument can be made that this is exactly what’s needed, to persuade other nations into terms more favorable to us. That’s particularly true if they’ve been getting a “free ride” for too long.In essence, a tariff probably doesn’t actually generate much revenue for a nation. It’s primarily a policy tool And all too easily forgotten is the consumer who “pays” in many ways. Most commonly, by paying the higher cost due to the tariff. But he also “pays” when a good becomes unaffordable or not available at any price.

                “To wrap this up, it seems likely to me that the public, and perhaps even economists, are in confusion or disagreement about the benefits of tariffs”I think you’re giving the gibbering classes too much credit. They aren’t confused or “in disagreement”. That would require thinking and making an effort to understand. Instead, they have all looked in their Little Red Book of economic dogma and turned to the chapter called “Tariffs Bad, Free Trade Good”, the entire contents of which are “tariffs bad, free trade good”. It’s just like everything else on Planet Amerika, the Hive Mind decides something and 5 minutes later everyone from the big titted weather-slut on local channel 8 to those pompous Eurotools in Brussels knows exactly what to say about it.If these goons were capable of thoughtful analysis they would reflect on the irony of “Leftists” and “conservatives” spouting the same doctrines as some simple minded college libertarian at the Ayn Rand club in 1991.

            Exactly. The primary fear is the tariffs will work. “Work” is doing lots of, well, work there since reindustrialization would be a long process and might fail, but the possibility of success is what rattled the sub-Clouds. I can see them working, actually, beyond forcing markets open.

                Re-industrialization would also provide something for working class young (and not so young) White men to do besides become addicted to fentanyl. I mean before you know it they might start developing some self respect and self confidence and using those good wages to buy homes and settle down and raise kids. Next thing you know young White girls are not riding the cock carousel and quitting their jobs in HR to become mothers. Then you know what happens… Yep, Hitler! Hitler is what happens.There’s also the fact that you can’t really re-industrialize and stick to your “net-zero” and “carbon-neutral” religion. People re-learning practical skills about making real things in the real world also implies a dangerous amount of time spent *not* staring at race and sex swapped digital propaganda.

        I’ll listen to the show on the way to the farm later. However, the environment that you outlined in the written intro is something that I think about often.While I think that ignoring the judiciary is acceptable, seeing as they are simply political operatives and not calling balls and strikes, it is just a matter of time before enough people are pushed over the edge and hoist the black flag.If you think about it, life right now in the US is still the best in history, even as upside down as it is. Things have to get much worse for there to be a break.The problem with stripping everything from people is that people with nothing to lose, act like people with nothing to lose.

            “If you think about it, life right now in the US is still the best in history, even as upside down as it is.”Astute observation. Despite all the lunacy of the culture, our civilization continues to function exceptionally well. I think we have far too much media. Wackiness and tumult sell better in a media environment than do factors of stability. Thus, the more media one consumes, the more one tends to buy into the illusion that things are especially screwed up today, like they never have been before. The reality is that the human race has always been a massive shit show. But during, say, the 1800s, people weren’t using phones to record the insanity and then broadcast it to the masses. With that in mind, I salute Zman for quitting Twitter. The things we avoid are often more important than the things we consume.

                Maybe things are great with you. Not so much for the millions of my brothers in U.S. streets. That is a VERY recent phenomenon.Best in history? Life in the U.S. in the Fifties and Sixties was superior to Current Amerika by orders of magnitude. We had FAMILIES led by FATHERS. Everywhere. High trust society. Kids played wherever they wanted, came home at dark. Great music, great film. Opportunity if you were willing to work hard.Unaffordable healthcare, unaffordable housing, rife false accusations, arrogant bitchified girlbosses, corporations that won’t hire white men, schools that won’t admit white men, hordes of entitled foreigners, largest prison population per-capita in the world.  Legal system corrupted by Woke, rotten and anti-American ‘leaders’ is the new U.S.What you got now is a woke, feminist, police-state, foreigner-invaded, totalitarian craphole. In short, satanic. Lots of people living high-hog, sure. The most millionaires in the world.But still satanic. Far, far worse than in my youth. An evil place to be a working-class man.

                    Heck, I grew up in the 1980s in the Imperial Capital region and had that kind of childhood: played in the streets (without fear of getting run over), was out until dark during the summer nights, etc.
So it’s not just the 50s and 60s.
The evolution to insanity is much more recent than that.

                        It was in the 90s when kids quit playing outside unsupervised. Culturally, a lot of things changed for the worse in the 90s. In between the 60s and the advent of sail foams about 2012, I would say it was the decade when the most did.

                        The Eighties were still reasonably sane and decent. PC and feminism had not yet conquered all the institutions, and many Heritage Americans were still in charge.
After the Eighties were done, though, the devil took the place over completely.  Even the churches folded to Princess and PC. I guess lotsa people are still living large. Many millions are not, however.

                I agree. Materially and infrastructurally, life in AINO is quite good. Very few AINOians lead a subsistence existence, the vast majority of us have access to good healthcare, and the currents of water and electricity run consistently. (So far.) However, there is far more to life than the basic materials needs. There are also the cultural, psychological and aesthetic realms. And in those areas, AINO is a living hell for any normal person.

Really? Have you looked at the streets of your cities recently? Because a lot more than ‘a few’ are living in them.  Goes for the medium and small towns, too.
Life in New Amerika is great for women and foreigners, tho.  I’ll give you that.

                        Cumulatively a fairly large number, but proportionately, statistically insignificant. What’s more, most of the street bums are cognitively incapable of leading a much better existence. They should probably be institutionalized.

                            There are a lot of rural, lower-income Whites who are struggling, and they aren’t bums.  There are a lot of young 20s-30s Whites who are struggling as well – to find a mate, to be able to afford a house and family formation.  They aren’t all bums either. The commentariat here skews older and professional.  It is not an accurate reflection of the ‘average’ heritage White American.

                            That is such b.s.
Most of my life in the U.S., the streets were almost empty of homeless men. Now they’re everywhere, even in the midsize towns.
You need to believe that the millions of men in New Amerika’s streets are there because they’re all bums. Bull.
Some are drunks and druggies and locos, but most are men tossed out of society to make way in the colleges and workplaces for Muh Precious Princess, homos, and the Of-Color ‘minorities’.
Been homeless many times myself. You calling me a bum, boyo?

A key reason there’s more bums on the street now than in past decades is because extensive social services subsidize indigence. Plenty of scum have realized it pays better to panhandle and scam than to earn an honest living.

                                Yep. Back in the Sixties and early 1970s even drunks and locos could get decent-paying jobs, particularly at places where they had union protection.Back in the 1980s I worked with a guy who was a nice enough guy but had a drinking problem (and admitted it). He had been canned from all the major employers in the region. If he got fired on a Friday he’d just go to the next company on Monday and get another job.When I worked with him the gravy train was coming to an end. We were at a small employer, and he was off the bottle for a while. He ran the printing press and I did some editing and proofreading. I had a college degree and he didn’t — but he made twice what I did.

                                I’m not worried about the “bums”—whoever they are.  It’s those (large majority) who work their ass off everyday, only to get up the next and do the same—while hope for a better life  (the American dream) fades into oblivion as they get ground down by the system.  These folk break down and eventually retire to a life of poverty and fear of—yes—homelessness.  This is really 3rd world shit.With respect to Ostei, those young people are sons and daughters of good friends and decent people.  They work hard, but are only a few paychecks away from bankruptcy.  I was what one could call “poor” long ago, but the thought never occurred to me in now “lost America”.  I worked, went to school, got job’s, saved money—in short prospered.Today, I can’t imagine not being one of Ostei’s “bums” if I had to start over.  Really, I’d not trade for youth my current predicament of old age. I truly believe I could not thrive in this country as I did in the country of the 60’s and 70’s.Bum’s really are not the problem.  Opportunity in current America is.

                    “There are also the cultural, psychological and aesthetic realms.”
Yep, the psychological especially.  Many of us have attempted to secure that through isolation.  I can respect that, but that leaves the other 90% with little recourse.  The stress level here—even for those we conclude are doing quite well—seems intolerable.  That and genetics are my go too’s to explain much of what we see wrt to the “crazies” of the world.

            “If you think about it, life right now in the US is still the best in history”This is probably true for upper middle-class and above, but for all below that line this is not the case.  In the 90s, as a recent college grad, I had no trouble buying a tolerable fixer-upper starter home on pay that was pretty pathetic.  At the same time I also paid off my college debt in short order, because it was vastly cheaper to go to a state school than it is now. Getting in as a patient in a white male doctor’s medical practice was easy.  Used cars were plentiful and functional and no longer rusted out like when I was a kid.  Food – amazingly cheap in hindsight.  Bacon and hamburger meat used to be junk meat for poors, thus affordable.  Admittedly, women were already terrible, but slightly less unsightly/unhealthy than now.Add in the spiritual wasteland this place has become, with its constant assault on every form of decency, and for ‘average’ people (and below) this country is worse than some of the third world.  No wonder the ‘soma’ of the electronic world is so effective.  No wonder birth rates are in the toilet and dropping.  Many young people today will never experience the optimism I enjoyed starting adult life in the 90s.  You need money to buy your way out of ‘normal’ life.

                The 90s is when all this stuff was first being caused.  Look at housing, for example.  I remember driving to work past this new division they were building with a big old sign saying “starting in the low 400s”  Allen Greenspan started bubblenomics in the 1990s and it has gone on full steam until today.A lot of the dysfunction in people was also created in the 90s, at least among the 30s and 40s crowd.  They were the first generation raised on helicopter parenting and participation trophies.  It was also when the schools started age based passing of grade level.   They never learned the most basic of skills to live what was until then a relatively normal life.Our problems are mostly not recent.  They go back decades or even many decades.

                    The roots of our problems are indeed old – and the wise saw, and warned, back then.  And were ignored, largely.  But most evil seeds take time to grow and flower.
But the experience of living in that time allows me to see that this is not a time a of peak material affluence for most Americans.  That’s already way back in the rearview mirror.  That said, truly things have never been this good for the upper classes.  They’d best enjoy it while they can.

                        “But the experience of living in that time allows me to see that this is not a time a of peak material affluence for most Americans.”Yep.  Simply look at the disparity in wealth distribution.  Slice it as you will, since the .com bubble, the bottom 80% of the population fight over 20% of the wealth.  Even the touted “Boomers” are not all wealthy as we’d think.  They now enter retirement with a median net worth of $200-300k with no pension other than SSI.No matter how you invest $300K (how do you invest that if most of it is a home), you will be lucky to generate $1,000 per month and SSI (average, not median) is now a bit less than $2k per month. National poverty line in the US is $20k for two individuals.  I don’t know where you’d live on that, but I’m pretty sure it’s bare existence most places.To me, this seems third world-ish.  I grew up in such an environment, and as such it seemed pretty normal.  You get used to things when you’re born to them.  But there always was a future for those who worked for it. I never felt trapped. Today?

Correct.  It is most certainly not.
It’s been a 50-year-long Wipeout for lower and middle class U.S. men.  A planned and micro-managed Wipeout.

                    ray-I agree.I believe the current destruction of people’s investment and retirement accounts is to create an economic draft that encourages desperate people to participate in the next big war, either in the factories or on the front lines.I know some will argue that it’s all funny money, and those working people with something in their accounts are getting what they deserve.I disagree with that perspective, mainly because I, and tens of millions of other working people out there have killed themselves for years and decades to earn and set aside the money to fund those accounts.That situation is totally different than the private equity crowd that literally wishes money into existence to exploit the economy, largely at the expense of said working people.

            life right now in the US is still the best in historyTrue in part, but it comes down to who/whom and to some extent where, doesn’t it? Someone under forty who has no prospect ever of owning a home, young white males are targeted for discrimination and have no good future job prospects, you get the picture. But, yes, most still have unprecedented financial comfort. This allows for all manners of fuckery and madness without pushback. That is going away, though, and once gone all bets are off. I actually suspect long run the tariff business will push off a day of economic reckoning, but it is still not going away. And as Ostei pointed out, the aesthetics are worse now than ever. Granted, you cannot eat aesthetics but you don’t have much appetite amid the ugliness.

            Broadly on the same topic is what Prof. Betz speaks of. He thinks the UK is sliding to civil war or similar societal crisis as reported on Derb’s show last week. I was a bit started to see his name mentioned in this opinion article in 4/3Telegraph(a major UK “paper”). The US isn’t the UK of course, But many of the topics you discuss in your post are found in Betz’s interviews.

                Let’s hope.  Civil war is England’s last hope.  Then, finally, there would be some anti-government rebels worth throwing the “black ops” budget at.  Man, that would be something to see…

        “One of the downsides of writing and talking about the current scene is that you often want to kill yourself or kill someone. There are only so many stories about a crazed judge issuing an equally crazed rulings you can read before you want to spit on your hands, raise the black flag and start slitting throats. To paraphrase the late comic George Carlin, there are a lot of people who need to be killed.”It can’t be coincidence that so many of us all arrive at this exact same conclusion.  Looking around at the current state of things, I completely understand why genocides have happened throughout history.

                My husband has to deal with people on the phone all day (I listen to his end and later ask about and commiserate with his day).  We normally go to town, church,and/or see neighbors once a week.  Due to highly inclement weather, neither of us have left the house since last Wednesday – it’s not due to stop storming until Sunday afternoon and our dirt/gravel road is likely to be a mess.  I used the last of the fresh strawberries last night, and we lost power for a few hours this morning (Generac came on).  We have each other’s company and are content.Lots of turkey and deer in the yard to feed and watch – who needs pets?

        The individual vote matters in a jury trial, because it can decide the verdict, especially when a unanimous verdict is required. But when millions vote and a bare majority is decisive, the value of the individual vote is near zero. One economist has calculated that you are more likely to be run over on your way to the polls than to make any difference with your vote.No wonder democracy has been defined as “two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.” So much for the idea that voting is a fundamental freedom, or that it protects freedom. The more democratic the U.S. Government has become, the larger and more rapacious it has become. The lambs keep losing the elections.Js

            “So much for the ideathat voting is a fundamental freedom, or that it protects freedom.’True, but an argument to that conclusion is a fundamental sophistry of “our democracy”. If you accept the argument and its conclusion, you are much less likely to ask potentially confusing questions about how democrats could have established democracy democratically.“The more democratic,…the larger and more rapacious it has become.”According to an old cliché, usu. attributed to JQ Adams, I think, every democracy wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. A better cliché would hold that every democracy wastes, exhausts, and murders the people in whose name it’s imposed. A corollary is that the antisemites are right to notice that the remnants of ancient Israel are very fond of being disproportionately influential upon every Western democracy, and that those remants promote feminism to our females and, to our men and boys, porn and sportsballs and pop music and movies and…

            Even if voting functioned as promised, it is completely useless.  The managerial class simply is not interested on our opinion on any subject.  “Democracy” simply means rule by the managerial class.  No matter what we vote for or tell pollsters or letters we write to the editor, we get “more of the same”  Some study came out a couple years ago which found that the more public wanted something, the less likely the elite were to implement it, but that the elite always got what it wants.  Voting is to government what commercials are to products.  It’s nothing more than public relations.  “Do you want change?  Vote harder!!!”

IMHO, this forum is more important than voting.  One needs to thresh out ideas and sharpen argument.  That is done here—whether we perceive it or not.  Some say we are in a bubble and just preaching to the choir.  Fine, but I for one steal shamelessly from the group, and for that, thanks.
Doesn’t mean I didn’t vote for Trump last election.   😉

                    I don’t think so.  Everything with women is something the managerial class already wanted.  They use voting as an excuse.  The managerial class pushes what it wants and then it catches on with the women voters. Then the managerial class uses the wishes expressed by the women as an excuse to do what they already wanted to do.  If women came up with their own political desires at odds with what the managerial class wanted, they would just ignore them.As I said in my earlier comment, voting is just propaganda.  When the voters put in the guy they want, they claim it’s the popular will and use it to justify what they are doing.  When the voters put in someone they don’t want, they rally against that person, like Trump.  If the alcoholic won, they would be claiming everything she was doing was because the voters wanted it. She was enacting the will of the people.  It’s like when people protest for or against what the managerial class want, it’s a sacred right. But when the people protest against what the managerial class wants, it’s a riot or insurrection.  It’s all PR.  It’s all BS.  “Democracy” is their rule.

            The only thing that matters in voting is influencing masses of voters using propaganda. If you can move 10,100,1000,… voters using persuasion based on costly means like ads, emails, but mostly manipulating a news source that people follow you can take the voting day off and go to the beach.At the end the election is won by the machine with more persuasive power. InfoWars is a great word for what our political environment is.The white pill is progressives/warmongers have the most expensive and sophisticated machine and they still need to cheat. The real war is the war for the minds if cheating is limited. Immunizing people’s minds with good morals so their vote is less easy to buy or morally robbed with sob stories is important.Black pill is Left Coast states squandering wealth in creating a parasite underclass to undermine conservative citizens.So at the end I agree demoncrazy is fake and gay. But under the rules of the existing game the play is to try to influence a many as possible and hopefully vaccinate enough people with good morals. But the rules need to be changed. Back to 1788 electoral process (Washington/Adams ’88 with the same rules to qualify as a voter, imagine it, is easy if you try!!!).

            Modern democracy is really a mobocracy. It is the problem Plato talked about when it comes do democracies, “as soon as people realize they can vote themselves a raise…they will and the gig is up”.
The idea of good honest men running a government is a valid idea. If only a financial supporter of the government was allowed to vote it would hopefully encourage a more honest and sane system. That seemed to be the intention of the Jefferson and the rest of the mob at the time.
What we have now is shit. IMHO.

        The daily car wreck of news isn’t all bad. Just this morning I was reading about a jewish “philosopher” at Yale who has moved to Canada to escape fascism. He says it’s like leaving Germany in 1932 or 33. No matter how you spin it around, a negative angle in this story cannot be found!Speaking of whether “work” and “purpose” makes one happy, I’d say it depends both on the work and on the time spent doing it. I’ve engaged in my share of wageslave drudgery, and I’ve engaged in my share of carefree idleness, and I know which one I prefer. I haven’t had anything you’d call a job in about a dozen years and I do not miss it AT ALL, am grateful every day that I don’t have to. That being said, I’m positive I’d love being the grill man at a Waffle House, but only for an hour at a time, not for a whole 8 hour shift. Kind of like how I’m sure I’d enjoy being an OTR trucker, for the first week or two, after that probably not so much.

        I think there is really something to twitter and keeping up with the news in general, or current events, as a way to prevent most people, not mr man of course, from thinking deeply. Keeping up with current events makes you constantly locked in the “now” and not in the good way!  From old Joe:When you internalize an author whose vision or philosophy is both rich and out of fashion, you gain a certain immunity from the pressures of the contemporary. The modern world, with it’s fads, propaganda, and advertising, is forever trying to herd us into conformity. Great literature can help us to remain fad-proof.

        from the evidence I see, our elites are satanically evil and benefit in their efforts from technology.  I do not expect for technology to improve life in the future. it has been used almost entirely to reduce freedom ,propagandize and impoverish for the last 25 years. when the WWW first came out and it was the “wild west” it was a great improvement in many areas of life. However, it has been turned into a complete tool of oppression in the last 20 or 25 years. It has gone from a great source of objective information to a monopoly on information that is biased in the extreme. For the wrong thinkers out there, we may someday be the target of WOKE 2.0 or covid 2.0. The data they have collected on every living human being on earth will be there for them to go after the reluctant. You didn’t sign you 8 yr old son up for the sex change the AI says he will want when he is 18? your CBDC will be locked, your car won’t start, your lock to your house won’t open, your nest thermostat will cut off your hvac, you will be fired from your job, your email and phone will be shut off.and on that thought , have a happy weekend!

            Yes, the panopticon is a dismal prospect, but there are always counter-currents:(1) Passive or active resistance. There are always ways to game systems. London’s ULEZ cameras are constantly being vandalized, for instance. Will CBDC record every transaction? Maybe. But how will they know that the dozen eggs “I” bought were actually traded to my neighbor as payment for some off-the-books good or service? Is all cash outlawed? Perhaps. But no government anywhere has ever stamped out black (free) markets. The underground may trade in gold or silver coins, packs of cigarettes, or what-have-you, but freedom doesn’t die easily.(2) The inherent weaknesses of any centralized system. The more automated, the more the risk of a failure somewhere. Sloppy design, maintenance and operation take their toll, whether in equipment breakdowns or hundreds of people dying when two aircraft collide due to someone’s screw-up. A single (admittedly large) unit fails at a London power substation leading to a spectacular fire and forcing Europe’s busiest airport out of service for nearly a full day. Note that such incidents could be “helped along” by deliberate intent but tat falls under (1). Unless we’ve gone to total repression, when major systems screw up, they will inevitably cause disruption or even serious harms to the populace, who will complain and, with modern media, widely publicize the failings.For every measure, there is a counter-measure.

        I have also cut back my Twitter usage for the same reason as Z. DOGE sucked me back into reading posts off and on throughout the day. When it became apparent nothing would change in a major way to the system, I started cutting back.Once when I was younger, I quit following the news for a year. When I went back to following the political show, I realized nothing had really changed in that year. Same old, same old.I need to follow politics at a high level to overstand the likely trends in the stock and housing market but I really don’t need the weeds. Even though I am interested in the details nothing will change because white people won’t rebel except in the fantasies of both left and right. The left fears these fantasies and the right welcomes them but they are still fantasies

            For a while I was following the war in Ukraine very closely, watching the Military Summary youtube channel. Every day the Russians would seize a few more blocks of rubble in some bombed-out village and the narrator would promise that a major breakthrough was about to happen. But it never did, only the same creeping grind. Eventually I stopped watching the daily video updates and checked in only once a week or so to find that nothing much had changed. Now I don’t even bother with the videos, instead I take a quick look at the maps once a month or so and it’s enough to tell me where things stand there.I’m gradually pulling back from politics and “the news” in much the same way.As for the stock market, for many years now I’ve preferred to go to stockcharts.com or similar site and use weekly bars and relative strength indicators to tell me when the long term trends are looking toppy or bottoming out. Again, not worth stressing out on a daily basis.The weather’s warming up and it’s time to start thinking about getting the tomato starts out into the garden. I find the pace of that sort of thing much more congenial.

                Same with me on the Ukraine and stocks as well as Gaza and the rest. I find with stocks I am leaning increasingly to Buffet’s advice on just investing in some index funds ( along with some gold and bitcoin).
The market, like everything else, is just too rigged for the insiders. I have found The Dow Theory folks to be the best on bigger picture market trends so I just follow them for when to sell or buy the indexes. A general sense of politics just let’s me know how to allocate to what indexes.

        For any sane person to retain his sanity, he simply must exit the Great Derangement from time to time. Z got out of Twit, I did the same with Farcebook many moons ago.And I agree that writing about the demented menagarie that is our public square requires some hard bark. For many years I wanted to be a syndicated columnist, but as Z says, doing that kind of work requires one to wade through the mephitic dreck constantly. Not good for one’s mental health.Relatedly, it’s a good thing I never pursued a professorship. Life within the belly of the beast would have been no life at all. And it may have been rather short.

        Cheer up Z. And, uh, do what I say not what I do. It is bleak.That said, I think when leftists like this say the same things you said a couple of days ago, we are not far from flags hoisted. I think there are those of the old liberals, who got bamboozled by the GAE’s Imperial Leftism, who have come around. It is interesting to listen to them talk this way, and also to walk over the history and the people behind it.I post this to perhaps find something to take heart in. Even old liberals are calling to raise the old black flag.https://www.lewrockwell.com/2025/04/brandon-smith/how-globalists-use-crazed-leftists-to-piss-off-the-populace-and-provoke-dictatorship/

        I may have said this before, but when I started in the financial services business in 1979, there weren’t any billionaires that I can remember, other than maybe the Hunt brothers, who were trying to corner the silver market at the time.  The mere fact that there are now untold billionaires in this country, let alone the world, shows how massively skewed monetary things have gotten.  But the screaming meemees will be screeching about a “market meltdown”…

            Best guess in 1979 was 13 billionaires.  In 2024 Forbes listed, 813 billionaires.  This is in line with the “great divergence” in American wealth.  Middle class income remained flat, arguably losing to inflation.  Wealth in the hands of the upper quintile—really upper 10%—soared exponentially.Aside. Tucker had the new Sec of Treasury on his show.  When asked about tariffs and stock market decline said this (paraphrase):  ‘The stock market reflects the very wealthy’s interests.  88% of the stock market is owned by the top 10% of the population.  The next 40% own the remaining 12%.  It’s the bottom half of the country that suffers the worse in the current economic condition. They can only sell their labor to survive.  Trump aims to correct this situation.’Truer words never were spoken.

        Excellent show. This may be a better format and funner way to do the show. It seem the following of your show are quite aware of how far we have fallen as a society.I like you have been very angry as of late.  It is because our smart fraction running things are perfectly happy looting the country and people for their benefit.They should be smart enough to know this will lead to societal failure of epic proportions.  Yet they have built the system to benefit the people running it to the detriment of the system. It appears there is no way to change course or fix anything because our best and brightest are too greedy and selfish to do otherwise. They designed the whole system for graft. Everyone is in on it; bureaucrats, politicos, ngo types, dog catcher, you name it and they are doing their best to fleece this once great nation.unfortunately I fail to see how this conclusion is incorrect or wrong. I wish it was.  It is angering that the worst humanity has to offer is running the world. English doesn’t have a word bad enough to describe them.

        Sports: Athletics is a way for society or tribe to discern which boys and young men are fit for war, and which are not.  That was always its purpose.In fact, we need MORE athletics at young ages for boys, and none or few for girls. . . and before dotter-daddy hits the roof, consider again the prime reason for athletics, which is NOT television or commercial revenue or stroking the egos of females, but to identify which of your young men have the fighting spirit.Hanging the Occasional Politician:  Would change exactly nothing.  Modern politicians are largely frontmen and frontwomen, who rarely make major policy.  (See Biden, Joe)  Most policy comes from the wealthiest transgenerational families, and from huge corporations.  That’s who really ‘makes our rules’.So if you’re in favor of the Occasional Public Hanging, which I am, make sure you hang the right people — young members of the financial/banking elite or major corporations is an excellent choice, because our rulers would FEEL that: annihilating their futures.Same with a nation’s elite families: if they make evil policy, drag a couple members out of their estates and redoubts and string them up on Rumble.  You will see change then, rapido.Take it from my old buddy ‘John Ruth’.‘When the Hangman catches you, you hang’.  O yeah Daisy, I wanna see them witchboots twitch.

            “Hang the right people”:Sadly, that is precisely why in unstable societies it is the custom to kidnap, ransom, sometimes torture and murder not only wealthy businessmen and politicians but also (alas) their relatively innocent family members. For extra anarchy, add assassinations of influentials to the mix, be he a local politician, judge, or even reporter that was writing something that pissed somebody off.As with a great many things, we in “The West” take it for granted that we can (with nearly if not 100% assurance of security) travel from one city to another without being waylaid, or even walk around our city without being assaulted or robbed. I assure you that such are exceptional whether by the standards of history or even what is the norm in most parts of the world!A society is healthy to the extent that such stuff happens rarely, if at all. But even here, we’re not immune, as Luigi showed just a few months ago.Sadly, if Betz and others are correct, such anarchy is what we are inevitably heading for.

        Your take on AI and it’s repercussions seem a bit different than your conversation with Paul Ramsey. What you say today about how irrelevant AI creative content will ultimately be because of the unhuman part. I don’t even like to watch a decent youtube video narrated in a pleasing robot english voice.Good art and music will always find an audience even if by some standards crudely done. Just because Paul can generate cute art for his daily shows doesn’t eliminate the use of most human created artist. People like that never invest or purchase our work.Obviously a lot of the future of AI in it’s technical and research assets will be a great help. Creating music, writing and all aspects of visual arts is a niche area that only a few will find lucrative. AI won’t make much of a difference either way on that.

            Like everyone else, I get suggestions from Spotify of what music I might like. Some of it I do end up liking, and save to my playlists. Much of it by artists I never heard of before. If this music was AI generated, and I liked it enough, I’d save it to my playlists just the same. So I guess the question is how much money is in that for the creator, and if it’s worth the trouble.

                Much the same here, but I listen mostly to SoundCloud. SoundCloud was set up precisely so that independent creators could upload their wares and (hopefully) profit form it. I’m strictly a listener, but I like the niche music available, whether individual artists or mixes created either by the service of by DJs who produce mixes sometimes including legacy music. These latter strongly recall the real, live radio DJs of yore, which I think disappeared from the scene decades ago.Tastes differ, but I’d much rather hear some obscure European creator’s new electronic music that’s in a genre I like, than to listen to “Sweet Home Alabama” for the 100,000th time on mainstream “classic rock” feed. And if I ever want that song, or many others, it’s usually available on SoundCloud or many other services.

        Presentation from July 29, 2009; Dan Slane of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.This dude was quite a successful businessman, lawyer and real estate developer from Ohio, and Speaker of the House John Boehner nominated him to join the commission. He has some very interesting insights about doing business in China.I saw this in real time back in 2009, but it left an impression on me. I thought I would watch it again and I thought you all might be interested.He was no MAGAt. In fact MAGA didn’t even exist back then. He’s just a run-of-the-mill guy who I would imagine was a middle of the road Republican from Ohio. Somebody we would probably consider a cuck if he were still alive.It’s interesting that some of the things he talks about in this video are taking 16 years before anybody got around to listening and doing something about it.https://ohiochannel.org/video/columbus-metropolitan-club-us-china-our-economic-security

                    It’s a good plea. Sometimes I invoke also the head injury I experienced while skiing in Colorado ca. 2000. I was in some moguls which ran parallel to a groomed part of the run. Lost my groove, veered onto the hard corduroy, lost my balance, and wham!. Hit the back of my head. Felt woozy and nauseous for hours afterwards.

                Agree, but that assumes a bit as to how we assimilate information.  Yes, I am a great one for the spoken word—especially poetry from a trained voice.  But for more complex thought, reading is my thing.  Many a time I’ve had to read and reread a particular point in the essay.  Sometimes my concentration wains and I need to stop and rest.  All too often I am ignorant of a concept, or an acronym, or even an alternative word meaning and must look that up to read/understand further. Of course there is the occasional quotations in a foreign language to be tackled.I been in the business for more than 50 years now and I am still learning anew.

                Sorry, but wrong here. Shakespeare is better read. And, if you disagree, I would invoke the great Dr. Johnson, who wrote on that specific subject in his “Preface to Shakespeare.” Too much depth to Shakespeare. No offense – I’m a subscriber and have been for years – but you are not the Bard!

                The problem with Shakespeare onstage in the last century or so (I dunno how it was at the Globe back in the day) is it is almost invariably overacted. Extremely overacted, usually.

                Producing a transcript would not be a lot of work, Z.But only if you want to:take your final (aired) audio file and load it into Grain.com and it will make a transcript for you in 5 minutes or less. (Account and subscription required of course.)BUT — just FYI.Its a good service.I have it connected to my zoom account, so if I need a zoom meeting recorded, the recording  automatically goes over to Grain and I can get a PDF of the meeting.Not saying this is necessary.BUT– as Derbyshire said about this scholar guy Betz, who is a horrible speaker and should stick to writing, in some cases, it’s better to read the info.

        Agreed on the fact that AI will kill AI-generated artistic content.  Once the novelty wears off, all you’ve got is cheap AI produced junk that required no talent to produce.  We will see human-created content gain in popularity and value, but in smaller niche markets.  Make a product, create an audience willing to pay for it, make a living as a craftsman.  Maybe have a side hustle for income stability.
Always fun to make a comment on Thursday and hear your commentary on the same topic coincidentally the next day.

            I foresee just one of what would likely be sundry problems with AI generated entertainment, audio or video.Consider that a large fraction of the normal “text” on today’s Internet is AI generated to varying degrees. Some is easily detected by errors of grammar, context, etc. But some is skillful and even deceptive, as anyone who’ used Grok or a similar AI could attest.Problem: many of the current so-called large language models are “trained” on stuff scraped from the Internet. There’s probably little or no quality control, thus the ancient rule of computer science rears its ugly head: “Garbage in, garbage out.”Certainly steps could be taken to preen the training data, but only at great costs and expense.I fall to see why the same problems won’t happen with AI generated “music”.

                It’s an economic problem. After the fad wears off, AI will drive the economic value of its own products to zero. It takes no effort to produce it, so there’s no good way to charge for it. No bands, no production teams, no tours.AI may herald the end of consumer culture. If any stupid slob can “write” (ie generate) a novel and own fancy gadgets, then those things no long have value as status symbols. If something has no value, there’s no point in having it.It’s the same problem utopians like Rogan are starting to wake up to. “Hey, wait a minute. What are we going to do with all the people displaced by automation and AI?”A great die-off is probably coming for humanity. Some people, like me, think it is already upon us.AI has the potential to accelerate this.  Not just because it’ll replace so many people.  But it will also be used to decide who lives and who dies pre-birth.

        I can tell it’s still you (the “live” Z Man) writing the posts, because there are typos.🙂
And in this case, that’s “clear evidence of authenticity”). Even though I hate that word “authentic,” in this case, it’s relevant.
So it’s a positive case for having typos!

        Pro sportsball could easily be converted to an AI format operated by gaming algorithms seeded with the usual dice-roll random events that are embedded in on-line games.Players are no longer actually human, of course, but computerized renditions with profile and aptitude qualities purchased by franchises using “league dubloons” – same, same as in an on-line game.The economic argument for AI Sportsball is compelling and the fans wouldn’t care.  One could even hire representational human contract actors to pose for selfies and sign merch a la comi-com events.This inspiration came from televised Covid Era sports stadia bleachers packed with cardboard cut-out fans.

        The ‘goodbye’ power is something straight out of ‘Death Note’ and yes all our lives would be real busy : ^ )) But if you really think about it, the requirement of physically being there would lead to your capture in a matter of days due to the surveillance state. So I’d get in a WEF event to make sure at least the big parasites are out of the picture. Great show!
