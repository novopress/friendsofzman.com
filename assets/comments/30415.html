        What Dilemma?
Add cowardice too.
While we were dithering they built a prison, now they craft our demise.

        Z’s example of the bagel lady scamming the court is a daily reminder for me of Tom Wolfe’s law that all political and social conflicts are really battles over status. I don’t think that is always true of the right of the divide but it is true of the left.
The bagel lady will face no shame for undermining rule of law nor will she be seen as attacking “our democracy.” Instead she will gain status as a good person who is speaking truth to power and showing her loyalty.
Consequently, I would be shocked if she is punishedm

            Talk about timing. I’ve just started reading The Bonfire of the Vanities. The absolute clown show so eloquently described by Tom Wolfe is a stark reminder of what a joke the legal system is and how seriously the clowns take their own performance in it.

        There is no dilemma. You respect human law, which itself is a social construct and a corruption of natural law. You keep trying to defend a system which is pure evil and always has been. You’re a little foolish boy, Z and you always will be, because you simply cannot accept that the system you believe in, the system that benefits you, is inherently flawed and a scam.Reading your blog is like reading crypto bros on Reddit – absolute clowns who cannot comprehend why their precious systems are falling apart. Every scam falls aparts. And civilization and the “legal system” are nothing but scams that prey on nature.There are no lawyers, judges or courts in Nature. And that which does not exist in Nature cannot last.The answer here is simple – civilization WILL fall apart, the legal system WILL die out, and ideologues WILL kill each other in actual warfare as that becomes the last way they can maintain attention from their audience.Your kind is rapidly losing entertainment value and turning into an exhaustive performance. That only ends in bloodshed. War between evil people has a deliciously entertainment value.You’re a clown, Z. Anyone who is this interested in politics is. Your problem is that you think you have wisdom to dispense. You don’t. There is no way anyone can fix this, it always ends in complete destruction.The myth of Sisyphus is real.

        I have a grand unified theory that it can’t be that much of  coincidence that the second red scare era from 1945 to 1955 (first red scare would be 1917-1922 thereabouts) ended just as the civil rights movement started.The red scare era was the last gasp of the old school cpusa labor left as well as the last gasp of the old right. The end of the red scare era also is approximately the time where the left becomes anti Soviet (I think the 1956 Hungary thing is what caused that).Does anyone think this is significant or am I trying to see something that isn’t there?

            The working-class left and its nominal representatives (a few Irish-American and northern English pols) did become somewhat anti-Soviet during the “Marx is just tanks rolling through Prague” (as Bukowski said) era. They were officially excommunicated by the Port Huron Statement, which you can still find with Google because it’s a leftist thing.The commies I’ve known are all very rich. They were fully pro-Soviet until the very last second of the empire, got very confused but went broadly “Islamist” and anti-Israel during the last couple decades, and have become NATO/globohomo “anal empire” fanatics now, currently waving the flag of the American color revolution in Israel.The “old right” straggled on through most of that and wasn’t fully banished from respectability and television until *after* the Soviet Union collapsed. It was our first opportunity, in the official absence of any overt global war/threat/ideology, to become “relevant.” We were defeated instantly.

            KK: “Am I trying to see something that isn’t there?”Well, technically speaking, psy-ops are immaterial phenomena, so they aren’t “really” there; they simply flourish in our minds’ eyes.But the Council of the Sanhedrin certainly do seem to throw a new psy-op at us at least every 7 to 8 years, and sometimes as often as every 4 to 5 years.Heck, in 2020 alone, we got Saint George, Cheeto Man Bad, the k00f, the election steal, the v@xxines, and probably some other stuff I’ve already forgotten about .Speaking of 2020 &amp; the v@xxines, last night somebody at /pol/ re-poasted this epic exchange courtesy of two autiste br0z chez M0dern@…https://tinyurl.com/y3z6raesI’m still wondering whether it’s safe for us pure blooded boyz to French-kiss v@xxinated chicks…Z: “The dilemma is not about believing the story is true but about trusting your own judgement.

        If a representative from the mainstream media were to enter these comments and try to defend themselves, is there anything they could say that might be worth considering? I think that there is, and it wouldn’t hurt to play Devil’s Advocate for a moment just to try to understand what might be happening on the other side. While it’s fun to engage in partisan MSM bashing, it probably won’t lead to constructive solutions going forward, but striving to understand them might.I know we’re all familiar here with Gell-Mann Amnesia, because it’s a trope that gets a lot of mention in Dissident Right circles. This is when people trust the media on issues they know nothing about, even though they are quick to spot the media’s inaccuracies on subjects they do know something about, with the implication being that the media is always inaccurate but we happen to forget about it most of the time.However, a deeper question would be to askwhythis occurs, and we see that the very description of Gell-Mann Amnesia itself contains a flipside and an explanation of the phenomenon.If we asked our MSM advocate why he is so inaccurate, he would say, “How am I  supposed to be otherwise? I have no idea what I’m going to end up talking about everyday, and there’s no way I can have accurate, particular knowledge of every subject. I have 90 seconds with which to communicate a news event to a very wide audience whom I cannot see or hear, but which consists of people from very diverse walks of life, many of whom aren’t too bright themselves but can be rather excitable. I can’t have people taking to the streets with pitchforks; I can’t have people suing the network because I offended them or said something libelous. But on the other hand, it’s my job to keep people interested and keep eyeballs glued to the screen, so I almost have to resort to a rather watered-down template which doesn’t deviate too far from audience expectations. This is all I can do in my position, so what the hell did you expect?”Furthermore, we can’t reasonably expect a generic audience not to have such expectations, either. The cult of expertise is not something that was imposed upon the world by force bysoi-disantexperts. It was condensed within the world like dew out of the ripeness of a real need. Most ordinary people are dimly aware of the limits of their own judgment and really can’t do their own thinking anyway, nor do they want to. They need someone to water down and predigest their information for them because they really are ignorant about many things and “Gell-Mann Amnesia” is simply a reflection of their natural state.Thus, once we understand what’s really happening here, we see that the problem is really a matter of scale. There is no large, national media that could ever be anything other than what our mainstream media is, simply due to the nature of the case. The person with accurate, particular knowledge is in a different realm. He is like the man who just had a car accident and is getting frustrated with the lackadaisical attitude of his insurance agent. Of course, he has a different (very personal) view of his car accident than does the insurance agent whose job is to aggregate risk.My point in heading down this rabbit hole is to say that the general templates of the broadcaster are not locally accurate, but neither are they supposed to be. They are meant for a different kind of consumption. They are like the great, undulating Rossby waves in the stratosphere which do influence the storm tracts in the troposphere but are only distantly related to that flooded underpass that’s screwing up your commute. They are both ostensibly “weather,” but not in the same sense.If you want to change what’s going on in the stratosphere, you can’t do that by filling it up with particular knowledge. You have to change it by filling it up with better versions of things that really belong in the stratosphere. That means, instead of the news media functioning as a false Church, you bring in the true Church, i.e. real philosophers and theologians, who have an expert grasp of generalizable knowledge. The cure for false religion is true religion, not nonreligion. STEM is the reply to bad physics, not bad metaphysics.The Dissident Right tends to get this very wrong because they lack any appreciation for metaphysics, but that needs to be remedied.

            ID asked,”If a representative from the mainstream media were to enter these comments and try to defend themselves, is there anything they could say that might be worth considering?.”I agree that it is valuable to grapple with the best arguments of your opponents.It seems to me that the sincere believers in the current order put all their faith in:1.	diversity is our greatest strength, which in practice means massive immigration and affirmative action2.	whites are responsible for most of the world’s problems, past and present.As far as I can imagine, such a representative would say, “You are factually wrong to believe that race determines so much.  Diversity really is our greatest strength.  People with beliefs like yours are our biggest problem.  Once people who believe that, for example, blacks are naturally more violent and less intelligent, are gone, then we will realize our best days ever.”

        The only conclusion one can draw from this piece is to shoot the transgressors, as nothing else can resolve the problem of the legal system rejecting the rule of law to accomplish their ends.
This is OUR country – a self-governing republic. We pay hirelings and delegate to them the authority to make and enforce the law. When they refuse their delegated authority the responsibility to enforce the law remains ours.

        The Biden clan has been intimately involved with multi tier justice since at least as far back as when Beau arranged the no prison plea deal for the DuPont who raped his 3 yr old daughter. Probably much farther. So from their perspective it’s understandable that they’d be surprised if anybody kicked up a fuss. Which brings to mind bored little rich girl Patty Hearst coming down with a case of jungle fever. A different kind of justice for the rich and powerful is hardly a new thing.  And it’s a separate subject from the regime’s tacit, and not so tacit, endorsement of vibrant street crime while simultaneously cracking down hard on non violent right wing dissent. Although it all emanates from the same Us and Them philosophical operating system.“If you only knew how bad it really was” is a phrase that pops up in my mind a lot these days, as we observe the small part of the iceberg that is visible. Consider the probability that we know of only a very small portion of the Biden’s perfidy, the FBI’s corruption, the CIA’s manipulation etc. etc. I doubt if even many self described dissidents can handle the whole truth.

Apparently Hunters plea deal is off the table. I don’t know if it’s a ruse, but if anyone can clarify, I would appreciate it.
I’m thinking the Deep State is putting the screws to The Big Guy because he won’t shuffle off peacefully.
Putting Hunter back at risk is a way to get the PedInChief to relent.

            When can Beau Biden’s involvement in the Biden clan’s plunder and deceit be dragged into the spotlight? I want to lift the unspoken censure that’s protecting the son that was supposed to be the heir apparent to The Big Guy.If Peter Doocy or any of the press had some ironclad balls, I would love to lob Dementia Joe a question such as “Hey Joe, the American people want to know : did the wrong boy die? You ever wish deadbeat Hunter was the one who got the cancer?”  Let’s crank the “Unafraid” tagline Fox News feigns every day to 11.

            In 2009, Richards entered a guilty plea and was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter,[1][5][6][7][8][9] after the girl reported the abuse to her grandmother.[4] Instead of serving out his eight-year prison sentence, the sentencing order signed by Delaware Superior Court Judge Jan R. Jurden said that the “defendant will not fare well” in prison and thus the eight-year sentence was suspended.[5][7][9][10] Delaware Public Defender Brendan J. O’Neill expressed surprise that Jurden would use such a rationale to avoid sending Richards to prison.[5][7]In 2010, allegations were made that Richards had also molested his son beginning in December 2005 and continuing for two years.[1][6][4] Police and prosecutors investigated but did not find sufficient evidence to pursue charges.[6] Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden later defended the sentencing of Richards to probation, claiming there was a strong chance of the prosecution losing at trial making a plea bargain necessary.[11] Although Richards was ordered by Jurden to go through in-patient treatment at a Massachusetts facility, he has failed to do so.[1

        It really would be difficult to be shocked by anything at this point. Regardless of one’s opinion of Trump, it is not disputed that federal law enforcement and intelligence services attempted to prevent his election and then attempted a coup d’etat. The important part is there were no consequences whatsoever for something that might have received the death penalty in the not-so-distant past.My guess is adverse consequences will manifest first in the economic sphere. Whether justified or not, American markets have/had been attractive because they were perceived as transparent and subject to the rule of law. While the extrajudicial seizure of Russian assets was a very glaring example of the current unreliability of American markets and investment, think about some other recent outrages–Sam Bankman-Fried is not an outlier. The best example, I think, was the federal investigation of the kids involved in the brilliant Gamestop affair, which was a simple and legal case of them outwitting the usual thieves.What concerns me is the accelerated pace of looting by The Help. They at least seem to have been given the heads up to get while the getting is good.Hunter Biden’s plea deal very well may be rejected–that would be the correct thing to do, at least–but that it got to this point has laid the system bare as utterly corrupted and FUBAR.

            Jack Dodson:  I only skim the headlines these days, particularly about Hunter Biden, because I know nothing will happen to him regardless of how many crimes were committed.  I’m just not interested in following the spectacle – because that’s all it is.To me, what’s more important – even more central than the dilemma upon which Zman based his post – is the point that all the lies and trickery and manipulation of the system is not because they love the Bidens or even mere ‘loyalty’ to fellow Democrats.  The blatant abuse and partisanship in AINO is always because they hate the White heritage population of former America.I’m always reinforcing this point when I share selected news stories of the latest black/brown atrocity with a friend who likes to believe the IKAGOs she deals with.  The vital point that too many downplay is not their genetic proclivities or cultural practices, as predictable and alien as those may be.They HATE you and they want you DEAD.  Never, ever forget that – because they certainly don’t.

                Yup. There is no justice system there is only a legal system. The free press are simply agent provocateurs peddling propaganda. Law enforcement have become armed mercenary agents of  political fads. Other than a few outliers, none are worthy of anything other than the respect you would give to a rabid dog.
And we can go back to the fact that the post said there was a lawyer with the name “Jessica Bagels”?

        I feel at some point that once the pets take over an organization, the real fun begins.
Like when roe was decided, the people deciding it were white/mulatto men born between 1898 and 1915. I’m assuming the decision was a gift to the MD community which was a republican constituency then. Also if the boss knocked up his secretary, it was an easy solution.
But in the year 2023, all those factors are mostly gone and the idiots arguing for abortion rights are complete  morons.

        The corruption of the criminal courts is old news. The whole criminal justice system is corrupt top to bottom.  The corruption is responsible for every story that starts with “Man on double bail kills….”  How do we get guys with 40 arrests walking around committing crime?  We’re supposed to have all these “draconian” laws, yet the streets are filled with young men with long rap sheets acting as a one man crime spree, shooting up the neighborhood, robbing liquor stores and selling drugs.Prosecutorial discretion and immunity allow the prosecutor’s office to reduce the charges of serious crimes with state prison time down to much less serious crimes with probation or shorter sentences with parole.  The whole thing has turned into a big paperwork machine keeping lots of people gainfully employed and criminals on the street to generate even more paperwork next time they victimize someone.  This is completely normal and that is why Hunter Biden’s sweetheart deal is “no big deal”This also creates a 2 tier criminal justice system. While Tyrone gets to commit low-mid level offenses with impunity, Billybob gets the full weight of the law on his head.  While Tyrone is getting arrested in a Democrat run city, with Democrat prosecutors and Democrat judges who believe in social justice and criminal justice “reform,”  Billybob is arrested out in the suburbs or the more rural areas where the law is taken much more seriously.

            Connivers and dupes deserve Tyrone, and Billybob may be both. Billybob is a sucker for flag waving, chauvinism, and slogans such as “Make America…”. Billybob frequently thirsts for the blood of foreigners who have done him no wrong but who can’t defend theirselves against the military of Billybob’s empire. He thinks little and reads less. Billybob is often a glutton, a lecher, a pugnacious lout, or a gun nut who kills defenseless animals for fun. Probably Billybob is a drunkard or a pothead, too. He’s not even half the victim which you make him out to be.

                I never painted Billybob as a victim. I don’t want the criminal class to be handled with kid gloves.  I want them to live in utter fear of long prison sentences or being shot to death in self defense by someone he is actively trying to victimize.
Further, the rest of your comment is, frankly, retarded.

                I happen to live in what you derisively call “Billy Bob Land,” so I have a front row seat to what goes on there.  Frankly, I would not choose to live elsewhere.  Billy Bob’s criminal escapades are generally of the self-destructive variety, viz., drug and alcohol related stupidities, domestic violence and lately, computer/internet-driven pornographic/pedophilic misadventures involving illicit pictures of children.  Yes, these things are reprehensible, but they do not perpetrate  violence on innocent strangers and, more importantly they are a very small component of Billy Bob World which largely remains quite normal, with normal men and women doing normal man and woman things such as working for a living and raising a family in peace and tranquility.  Contrast that with what goes on in your vibrant urban neighborhoods, where merely being in the wrong place at any given time can result in your death by violence.  Your criticism of the white population of Billy Bob Land is misplaced and you are, frankly, a very stupid person.  Go away.

            It’s called anarcho-tyranny, and is in full force now but has been floating around for a while as you say. The thing is, though, I think it needs to be properly understood as a way the elites wage war on the citizens. It’s not just about the criminal justice industrial complex. The elites want Tyrone back wreaking havoc on city sidewalks ASAP. The elites do not care if he is harassing old black grannies in his own neighborhood, or well-to-do tourists in downtown. He’s essentially the elites’ weapon against normal people and normal society.

                I’m not saying you are definitely wrong, but I just don’t think this is that cynical, or at least not that cynical all the time. Though I would definitely agree with you about anarchotyranny.I think a lot of them genuinely believe their own BS.  They genuinely believe it is some kind of crime against humanity, or at least black people, that so many young black men get arrested and would be in prison if not for all the deal-making and corruption. It genuinely fills them with guilt and shame.  Of course, they don’t give a damn about their victims no matter who the victims are..Of course, sometimes it really is that cynical. The upper management over at BART did not genuinely believe that all the video showing black people committing the crime on the BART system was giving people the “false impression” that Black people were committing most of the crime on the BART system.  Frankly, I’m very surprised that they outright said it. They looked so ridiculous.

                    I believe you and Mycale are both correct. Negroes are indeed agents of derangment acting against normalcy, and they are also “victims” of a “racist” society. There’s no reason members of the Power Structure can’t believe both.

        What’s most fascinating to me is how unnecessary all of the Biden’s crimes are. High-level politicians and their families can easily get extremely rich via perfectly legal routes.However, you generally can’t be too egregious with family members and you have to wait until you are out of office to really cash in via speeches, books, consulting, foundations, boards of directors, etc. Outside of his quick stint from 2016 to 2020, during which time he was mostly running for office, Biden was in office.That’s how the Clintons were so effective. After office, Bill would rake in the money while Hillary remained in office. They were getting paid for Bill’s service while in office and Hillary in office. Nice deal.Biden didn’t want to give up the direct power of being a senator or president, so he needed his crackhead son to get the money.Regardless, if the Clintons were the first change in the morality of Washington (letting grifters scam the system), the Bidens are a second wave. Even the Clintons kept things (sort of) under the surface. The Bidens are just out in the open.There’s no going back from here. Leaders that openly take bribes and use law enforcement and the courts to punish opponents is the end game. Add to that the demographic changes and election shenanigans that will allow the Dems to control the White House (and thus law enforcement) permanently, and you have a South American system of government.The only real question is how long will it take Grillercons (and non-white hating whites in the military and law enforcement) to understand the change that has occurred. Once they understand the new reality, they’ll need to make a choice.

I think it will be pretty simple. One day we’ll wake up, to find out that all has collapsed. I think it will happen that quickly and suddenly, even though the signs were there all along..

                I used to think that we’d just have a slow slide to a Brazil-like situation, no fireworks, no break-up, just decline.Now, I’m not as sure. Our rulers seem intent on pushing things far more than they need to. What would have been the big deal about letting Trump win a second term. He wasn’t changing the long-term trajectory or “draining the swamp.”Trump was a bump in the road for our rulers. Let him win and quietly reinforce the election process (while also letting demographics take their toll) and get back on track in 2024. Instead, our rulers went ballistic – and it’s costing them.Our rulers didn’t have to start WWIII with Russia and China. But they did – and it’s costing them.Our rulers were doing fine in their goal to turn America into a corrupt Brazil that they could rule easily. Instead, they seem intent on provoking whites and running down the economy until something breaks.

                    I think that they are driven by irrational hatred of normal white men. They literally cannot stop themselves.They also hate the fact that a lot of white guys are still doing well, having families, and ignoring their hysteria. This drives them ever crazier. A lot of white guys aren’t following them off the cliff.They also believe their own narrative that white people are the past, and in the future there will be a vibrant diverse utopia. Problem is that there are over 200 million whites in North America. And we aren’t going anywhere. Us white people are preventing the utopia from being achieved.Basically they’re insane and seeing normal white men causes crushing cognitive dissonance and mental insanity. We beat them just by existing, which is kind of funny.Tldr the regime has a massive white person problem.

                    That is me. For a long time I have realized there is a fragmentation and dissolution underway. Hard facts in addition to observation support this. But I assumed that would be a long-term project. Increasingly, it looks like the clowns will do something so catastrophic that the whole bitch implodes. My hope is that it doesn’t prove fatal to all of us but I wouldn’t put money on it.

                        Jack-My thinking is that the lunatic effort to electrify everything with so-called renewables while removing fossil fuels (for lack of a better term) and nuclear power is going to be what eventually pushes the GAE economy and society over cliff.I don’t think CW 2.0 with the red states breaking away is going to work out for dissidents because the death cult in charge will move to flying cruise missiles at or even tac-nuking red state oil refineries and power plants.As we know from the Ukraine conflict, there is no effective GAE air defense against these types of weapons.

                    I’ve often wondered the same thing.  Just let Trump go and do his 4 more years and he won’t do squat.  Maybe another platinum plan to release black criminals or maybe bomb Syria, pointlessly again but so what.    There was something else behind the Trump hate.   Immigration is always on my mind.  I think they want so badly to replace the population that they could not anyone who even made a slight effort to curb it.  That might be a stretch but it does seem that population replacement is the number 1 priority of the administration.  They even took Texas to court because they put up some half way barrier in the Rio Grande.

                Well they’re preparing to outlaw his gas grill, so maybe that will help wake him up.  Or maybe not.  The dominoes keep falling and Normie doesn’t move.  However, I do think there might be a lot of quiet awakening and cold realization.  How can there not be in this environment?  In business they say to be afraid when a worker *stops* complaining, because that’s the sign he’s truly checked out and determined to quit.  Surely everyone has noticed the complete silence that now falls over political matters in mixed company?  That’s not a sign of calm or consensus, that’s a sign people are done talking.

            I doubt it will collapse. Ask a normal Chinese or Mexican or Russian about corruption in their country, and they’ll shrug their shoulders and basically say they’re only out to get theirs.White Americans have had a lot of generations getting used to git-er-done, gentlemen’s-agreement, rule-of-law, norman-rockwell-freedom-of-speech way of things. Normies simply don’t realize that the default settings for human interaction is suspicion or advantage-taking. Previous generations lived in an almost perfect world, and can’t contemplate that the US is becoming Mexico.And people like us, Z-readers, assume that our evolution from Norman Rockwell to Normano Gutierrez means collapse. It’s just an unfortunate regression to the human mean. White people have enormous potential for progress, or folly. Right now we’re in the folly stage.

            So, I think grillercons and normies, in many ways, get that we are living in a different country than we used to. I know that a lot of people on this side don’t think so. Yet, you know, not that long ago whenever I read about some insanely flagrant abuse of power I would see comments like “the FBI needs to investigate this!!!!”. I don’t see those comments anymore. Normies know the FBI is just another institution of leftist tyranny. Everybody knows that these Trump prosecutions are just banana republic nonsense and nobody expects Trump to get a fair trial in any of them. Nobody really trusts the CDC or medical establishment anymore. Even trust for the military has dropped precipitously as it has become obvious it is a leftist institution for social engineering (the truth is, it has been since the 1940s at least, but that’s a different story). Even your mind blind griller could see the the system arresting people who are praying in front of an abortion building while paying off BLM rioters.The past four or five years have really shown just how rotten the entire system is, top to bottom. They really have accelerated this thing and continue to do so. Now, what does this mean in the long run, i don’t know. I am sure it is leading a lot of disillusionment, and a lot of people are trying to keep their head down to protect what little they have.

                Seems we are following the typical empire collapse trajectory.  The penultimate step appears to be an overall distrust in the institutions, which then leads to widespread apathy and finally collapse.  I can’t think of a single institution in the GAE I would trust.  I can’t imagine expending the least effort to preserve the GAE.  My view may not have reached a critical mass yet, but I suspect it is getting there.  A real war with China/Russia would be a litmus test – how many will sign up for it, even with a new false flag Pearl Harbor?

            You need to understand their psychology if you want an understanding of why they relentlessly press things “farther than they need to”. It is also a reason why a Karl Denninger level of “it’s only about money” analysis cannot completely explain everything.
The problem in the mind of the sociopath is not that they don’t have enough (wealth, power, security, freedom, etc.), it’s that YOU have anything at all.

                    The issue isn’t just that this social justice program is a religion to them, although it is. It is that these people reject objective reality. They assume there is no limit on their power, and whatever they say is the truth. The contrast is, if you are a Christian who believes that God created the Heavens and Earth and infused it with a sense of order, and furthermore gave us reason to discern His order, then you know that there is a very hard limit on man’s capabilities. You know that, say, if God made you a man then you are a man and nothing you do or say can change that.So what’s the issue here, if you believe that reality is what you say it is, then ipso facto, there is no limit on how far you will push things. So when you say here, this man is now a woman, you have created a woman.

            It’s just another symptom of the decline. The naked corruption of the Bidens and Clintons was just not considered acceptable to the old guard. They were both mindful enough and smart enough to nip it in the bud.  They were weeded out long before they got near the national spotlight and power.  But as the top of the managerial class declines, so does their abilities.

        Bagels, may be ideologically driven. It is also highly likely that there is some payoff for doing this. She or a family or friend will get an appointment, a contract, a title or all three for having done this.It seems that survival and winning has been left out of the set of principles on our side. This is the problem the right has. I have written about this in previous posts. If they play to win and remove the cancers, they abandon their principles and think they destroy their own system. They are confused. That is a defense of the system that then assures that people who will play by the proper principles are the only ones permitted to sit at a wheel.Eventually, some Bagel, Biden, Obama or other such actor will do something that results in a great harm to a powerful but neutral figure. Their father will get shot in Brooklyn walking the street by a feral buntu on a scooter and bleed out alone with zero dignity (this happened a couple of weeks ago on camera). Someone’s son will be playing by their rules but get passed over. A private jet will be grounded and a family member forced to fly affirmative action commercial and die in a crash.Then, when it hits home, said persons will be angry and look out and see us, who are way ahead of them and realize they may just have the numbers, quality and proper disposition to put the bad batch of Bagels and the rest of this regime out back in a dumpster somewhere.

        “The ends justify the means. The other side of the dilemma are the people who reject this. They think the means justify the ends and that we must always respect the process.”“What this example shows is that the people who think the end justifies the means will always defeat the means justify the end unless the latter makes an exception and embraces the ethos of the former in order to restore order.”Machines break down without maintenance, the letter of the law can be twisted. There has to be an ordering principle, and it ain’t in the ideas or the stuff! It’s not making an exception, but understanding what you’re ackshully dealing with. We moderns have had that understanding bred out of us, but the primitives still get it.

            This is really the point. Having “faith in the system” is just  euphemism for putting yourself on autopilot, which is a convenience that becomes addictive. It’s also unavoidable. Maintaining full awareness of everything, all the time, is an impossible task, and this is why human history will never be “solved” as if it were simply a tricky math problem which might yet yield to exceptional brilliance. There will always be new challenges because man himself is finite.

                The real problem is that waaay more than half the population is too stupid to understand and too overburdened with economic survival priorities to spend the time necessary to discover/learn/care/act.

                    You’re right but it has always been thus.  The old school commies didn’t start winning until they accepted it: the working class will never rise on its own.  They’re not too stupid, they’re too busy (in an updated class analysis I would also include here would include here middle class grillers with a 401k and kids to put through college).  There has to be a vanguard with either the intellectual disposition or the economic wherewithal to do politics full time.

        You know what? It can’t be fixed. None of it. It’s too far gone and it won’t end until the collapse and dissolution of the United States. We don’t have anyone of caliber and ruthlessness like a Constantine I purging the Praetorian guard, or a Mahmud II liquidating the Janissaries.
If Vladimir Putin dropped a megaton hydrogen device on Washington D.C. while Congress was in session, all of our problems would disappear in a nano second.

Eventually they’ll get around to assassinating Trump, flat-out daring us to do something about it (Biden’s rhetorical specialty and one remaining faculty), and siccing our Pardo Pride Parade military on us, but each escalating step in the process has been so damn stupid.

            OT, but I saw a clip of Hannity interviewing RFK, Jr. about the Ukraine war.    Kennedy patiently explained that NATO expansion was a provocation, that the West had sabotaged negotiations, etc. Hannity stared blankly and kept interrupting to proclaim that “Putin is evil.”  Either it’s a dumb act for the boomercons or the man actually has the worldview of an eight-year-old child.  He probably eats Freedom Fries for lunch every day.

                Hannity has his marching orders.  It isn’t that media personalities are dumb (although many of them are), but they’re the sorts of people who don’t really care about politics.  They care about having a speedboat and what their hair looks like.  So when their boss tells them that the line is “Putin bad, Ukraine good” they don’t give a shit if it’s true or not.I remember a long time ago my parents ended up at some dinner event thing seated next to a local news anchor.  Completely vapid.  My mom said his trophy wife reminded her of the first graders she taught.

                Been mentioned before, so once more:  “Hannity is the stupidest man on the radio/TV, bar none!”
Yes, he does have the political mentality of an 8 yo. The problem with Hannity is not that he’s stupid.  It’s that he appeals to an extensive audience of people, who by extension are even stupider than Hannity.

                Don’t count yourself out. All of this will occur within another 10 years, possibly sooner if something really crazy happens, i.e., Poland invading Western Ukraine would be a good catalyst.
I’ll never forget December 25, 1989. It was the coldest Christmas day in my life of 59 years, and I still smile about the clip of a Romanian News Announcer saying that The Antichrist had been executed on Christmas Day.

            Historical fun fact:
It was the Marquis de Sade himself who incited the Storming of the Bastille.  While interned there, it was he who started yelling through the bars of his window to passers-by, that the guards were killing the prisoners inside.
Who will inspire such a love of the disenfranchised in America?  Who will respect the rights of the oppressed?
Roy Epps, I say.  Only in the Roy Epps of this land, can we find the highest principles, of upholding the law and speaking out for the common man!

        The rule of law has been replaced by the rule of man quite a while back in our country. It was just more subtle in the past so as not to raise the ire of the populus. Although the frog in the pan of slowly heated up water is a myth, the analogy rings true. They slowly at first, then all of a sudden, have decided that consent or concern from the citizenry is no longer an issue. And why would they? What signs or indication has the public shown that they would face consequences for the corruption and deceit?

            The “rule of law” is claptrap promoted by a class of people who want to obscure an old truth. Human laws, so called, and their enforcement amount to a system of rule by men, and sometimes by women, too. Such a system is not necessarily a bad thing, but obscurring or misrepresenting the truth about it is childish and insidious.Now, in the USA since at least 1787, neither consent nor concern from the citizenry has been much of an issue, except as a matter of propaganda and faith building. Read the very first sentence of our Constitution. “We the People…do ordain and establish this Constitution…” it insists. The assertion may warm the hearts of populists all over the world, but it’s contradicted by our own record of history, which anyone can verify: Many fewer than 1/2 of the people had anything to do with imposing the C, which was done with the trick of ratification conventions. When one of the states, Rhode Island I think it was, ignored Article VII and held a referendum on the Con, FEWER THAN TEN PERCENT voted for it. Notice also that Article VII pretends to tell you all about the law of “Ratification” and “Establishment” before both ratification and establishment. This sort of trickery is the very nucleus of “the rule of law”.We need to admit that Americans have had for centuries a great fake law used as a smokescreen for a system of rule by deceitful man and delusional man. So to say that our system needs to have its rot removed is not very helpful. The system and its leading people are wholly rotten. Both must go, and we can see signs every day that the USA will drag the world into prison or to death if allowed to carry on indefinitely with her ways.

                “Rule of law” just mean rule by the men who wrote the law. Then the men who interprept and then the men who enforce the law try to bend it to their respective purposes. Trying to evade the fact that men are, are always, and must always be ruled by other men always leads inexorably to the same end that all denials of reality end with. Failure, death, and destruction

            As Arthur notes, the.frog accepting a slow boiling is a bad metaphor because it is untrue.  The frog will jump out of the hot water at some point.
Given that we have so many experiences where people slowly accept what they would immediately reject, you’d think we would have a better metaphor than the inaccurate slowly boiling frog.
Any suggestions?

                Being slowly suffocated.  As the brain gets less and less oxygen, it goes into a torpor and what is seen as acceptance is more the lack of the ability of the brain to do anything about it.
A real life example would be a jet that loses pressurisation and the pilots don’t act quickly enough. There are enough examples where the planes continued to fly on autopilot till they finally crashed after the fuel was exhausted.
The end result is extinction.

        Kipling’s “The Beginnings” will no doubt be cited in the comments.  And, truthfully, I can do no better.  The refusal to accept hatred as a motivator is one of the more commendably damnable features of most humans.I think the inane Sally Field’s comments at some award ceremony need revision:  “You hate me.

            True, but I assume the people doing this have the ability to destroy the judge’s life if she messes up their plan.  She is also most likely a regime sympathizer.  Possible this could make her sentence Hunter to a trivial amount of time in jail just to send them a message though.

            Unless Bagels/Bengels is disbarred, they are all on the same side.Once involved in a case where the other side canceled a hearing on a motion set by OUR side without informing anyone.  We all show up for court sans the other side, and the judge asks what gives.  Clerk tells him the other side called and canceled the hearing.  Judge immediately gets other side on the phone and tells him to get his ass to court.  Went downhill for him from there.Can’t imagine what would happen to someone who faked being the other side’s attorney and withdrew a pleading.

            It’s okay. There’s a LPGA golfer called Brooke Pancake. She was sponsored by Waffle House. I shit you negative. BTW, that’s how much I care about Hunter. Until he’s in irons, I don’t care.

            You better site down for this one.
Meet K1ke Ojo-Thompson, a black woman founder of a DEI consulting firm.
Imagine when she meets a bunch of the chosen and tells them her name.
We sometimes discuss the power relations between blacks and the chosen.  Blacks are a club that the chosen beat whites with, but the blacks are too dumb to realize this and think that they have real power.  Hence, her sh*t test of a first name.
