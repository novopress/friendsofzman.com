            I would even go so far as to call it inflammatory. We‚Äôve had a long run of relative peace and prosperity. Im really worried the times are becoming interesting.  Z-man is really ruffling my feathers.

                Based on demographics, our likely ‚Äúlanding zone‚Äù looks like it‚Äôs going to range somewhere from Brazil to South Africa.
That‚Äôs more interesting than I really want.
But you see patterns of separation: that little white town in South Africa that Globohomo is hungry to destroy. Small white settler communities in Brazil and Argentina. Large-scale formal separatist movements in Quebec. Et cetera.
I think you‚Äôve got to start by separating in your mind. Then your options look more clear.

                Given the quality of this posting, I‚Äôd first suspect it‚Äôs one Zman has been working on for quite some time.  Then again it‚Äôs seems so effortlessly written that I could also believe he wrote this one night after dinner.  I‚Äôve been thinking about the worthlessness of citizenship for a while, been mourning the loss of value I suppose in my own way.  This was the glass of water I needed to get this particularly large red pill down my gullet.

                    Once you take this redpill, it actually gets easier. It feels good.
An analogy I used was that you‚Äôre no longer stuck on a sinking ship desperately trying to bail water out with a tea cup.
You‚Äôre now free to focus on the important things.

            Let‚Äôs concentrate on our own people and ignore probable dead-ends.Zman had a segment on Friday‚Äôs show that we should take heed of: it was the section on Pol Pot.  It reminded me of something one of the guys at the NW Forum had told me 2 years ago.  When the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Okay to be White‚Äù signs first came out the urbanites in Seattle went into complete meltdown. But in the surrounding areas many of the signs stayed up for weeks, some of them for months.Look up the ‚ÄúClinton Archipelago vs.Trumpland.  It‚Äôs by area not population ‚Ä¶but keeping the problems bottled up in their little enclaves  wouldn‚Äôt be all that difficult if the folks in Trumpland felt the need to do so.Forget Trump for a moment. In 2016 despite every social, cultural and political institution being against him‚Ä¶every single demographic of white men voted for him.  They didn‚Äôt just vote for him, they voted for what he represented.  That sentiment no matter how nebulous or what form it takes‚Ä¶ is our sentiment.

            Absolutely.  And, in typical Z-man fashion, well reasoned in a way that will make so many here squirm, who still hold certain civic nationalist tendencies or profess to cherish some nebulous ‚Äúliberty‚Äù or ‚Äúequality.‚Äù  Not only is there no going back to the old morality, or social contract, there‚Äôs no going back to any of the old concepts and their old myths and meanings.  The only way forward is through, and no proposals about merely limiting the franchise or everyone serving in the military will change this.  America is over.  Accept it and move on.

                There are no top-down solutions, and any manifestation of such a thing will get people arrested at midnight, and/or quietly disappeared.  Bottom-up, local small (and grey) communities, doing their own thing, connected to others sharing similar goals and values, is the only way forward.  Time to carefully network.

        ‚ÄúThe rulers have no more of an obligation to the people than the people have to one another.‚ÄùIn such an amoral world, life is justwhatever you can get away with. Thespiritof the laws, thespiritof morality‚Äìwhich are the more important part of them‚Äìare gone. That‚Äôs not really a functioning society at all, it‚Äôs just a bunch of lone wolves looking to eat each other.I remember visiting my grandma in a small town in Wisconsin 40 years ago. Not only did people not lock their doors, you could actually walk into neighbors‚Äô houses without knocking.When her grandpa passed away, some scumbag who had probably seen the obituary came at night to try to nab grandpa‚Äôs guns. Grandma locked herself in her bedroom and called a neighbor. In ten minutes every man in town was at her house with a shotgun, ready to justice the guy (who wisely did a runner) good and hard.Writing these things, I can‚Äôt believe it was something from America in my own lifetime. Now it feels like something from the Middle Ages.

            I went to a wedding in Orangeburg, South Carolina, in 1978. It was still a Jim Crow town, with the RR tracks dividing the town by color.
I was asked to go back to the house and pick up something that had been forgotten. I asked about keys and was told the keys were in the ignition and the house was not locked.
Walking around the church parking lot I confirmed that the majority of the cars had the keys visible, windows down.
Anybody been to Orangeburg lately?

        I swallowed that pill a few years ago, though perhaps in more grug-brained terms than this sharp exposition. We might have to start thinking in starkly diasporic terms.So I‚Äôll just throw out a though experiment about the Proposition Nation. Imagine if the Proposition itself were tested and enforced via, for example, some sort of lie detector test (don‚Äôt sperg me on the technology of lie detection, this is just a ‚Äúpolitical science fiction‚Äù thought experiment.)For example, people had to swear that they really believed in small government, enumerated negative rights, deliberative democracy, and the rule of law. If you fail the lie detector test they put you on a little sea dinghy with a case of MREs and saygood luck. And everyone takes the test when they turn 21.What would you end up with? A society probably 97% white, with the other 3% harmlessly dorky East Asians, Jews, and Indians. And Thomas Sowell. LOL, it‚Äôs an ethnostate!The problem with an open society that claims to have rules or propositions is thatit even allows people who don‚Äôt believe in the rules of the game to play the game.Imagine if you were playing Monopoly but some people were just moving the pieces as they wished without rolling the dice, and just grabbing money from other players when they wanted. Well, you‚Äôd kick those guys out of the game. You wouldn‚Äôt let them play again.My meat-headed understanding of Hans Hermann Hoppe‚Äôs ‚Äúphysical removal‚Äù is something along these lines.That‚Äôs one of the key points for religion‚Äôs success: proper religions exile or kill people who don‚Äôt play by the Book‚Äôs rules. And that‚Äôs why the left‚Äôs religionized dogma is winning out over the unreligionized, weak-tea political philosophy of the ‚Äúconservatives.‚ÄùSorry for indulging in hypotheticals, but this Saturday night post put me in the old college bull-session mood. (Do students even do that any more?)

        Part of the reason that this got so far out of control is that the direct cost of citizenship is defrayed by the bond market and the Fed.  The healthcare for the anchor baby is only half paid for by taxes, the other half is paid for by debt, using that national credit card.  it‚Äôs been going this way for a long time.  Part of this problem is a byproduct of the fiat monetary system, a system now so decrepit that as of late, it needs $100 billion injections into the repo market just to keep it from seizing.  If we actually had to PAY for scarce resources, as citizens, with hard tax dollars, suddenly the burden of inferior immigrants would be front and center.  It‚Äôs the reason why an Ellis Island immigrant with a lazy eye would be put on a boat and sent home.  Debt allows for overconsumption.  No one will want to pay the bill when it comes due.  Regions and ethnic groups will square off, and then fragment.The cold reality of scarce resources will unglue this county.  As Enoch Powell once said, ‚Äúrivers of blood.‚Äù

            Yes. To a globalist, all mass immigration is good, because while it may lower theper capitaGDP, it raisesoverallGDP, allowing the government to put more bills on the Big Credit Card.Look at it this way: a kneegrow living in Somalia is worth, say, $1,000 per year, but for the modest price of a plane ticket, you can suddenly raise his value to allow him a nice home, running water, comprehensive medical care, education for his kids, flat-screen televisions and iPhones ‚Äì in fact, it is his human right to have these things.This is great news for real estate speculators and flat-screen manufacturers, but the bill is foisted upon our children and grandchildren

                In-sourcing immigration and outsourcing production is a perfect pincer-movement for those interested in Western subjugation and auctioning off our social capital is lucrative as well, particularly when the brokers don‚Äôt need to live in the social-strip-mine squalor they leave behind.

            And toss in the ‚Äòmerit based‚Äô invasion marketplace. The globalists are selling shares (de facto citizenship) of our united economies of America for $500k. EB-5. So it is worth quite a bit.Yet they are also quietly upping the price of heritage American Citizens to renounce. If you are poor it costs you over $2k. If you have assets, the exit taxes will gut you.So you can‚Äôt sell your citizenship, you have to buy it out. We are merely indentured tax livestock. They are diluting our equity while making it illiquid.Immigration should be run like a club. One in for every one out. That would put it at around 5,000 people per year.The EB5 market should be the same. $500k to $1MM to sell my passport to some chink. That way they get new, arguably richer tax cattle. And moar diversity is our strength.Its insane that actual citizens are gaslighted into some flag waving notion of citizenship when every mechanism of ‚Äòour‚Äô government is actively working a ponzi mockery.

                    Return, exactly. The Economy is ‚Äúwho we are‚Äù to all these people, good consumers and producers with a growing class of muh democracy voting chattel.Lowest black unemployment ever, most Mexicans working ever, more women earning more than men ever. And so on.How are all the cloud people in public office NOT globalists when the Economy is everything to them and the Economy is Global?Further, how is the everyman not complicit in the Economy is everything through his everyday choices and his own fetish over economic indicators?Most men I small talk with, gen x and older, are all about ‚Äòthe market‚Äô their home equity, their passive income streams, or their Pensions?Most younger men are all about their college loans, their ‚Äúhustle economy‚Äù jobs, their budding ponzi schemes, and what they are owed for being born.There seems to be a serious game theory problem. One of many paradoxes I see in the dissident path forward. Anyhow, yeah the trump family office and other crony insiders are definitely not our people.

        Our race is our nation. The false patriotism pushed on moderate to right wing white males is what keeps them trapped in the system ‚Äì and keeps the system running.There is no point trying to salvage what exists. Voting red team won‚Äôt do anything. Yet thousands of white men join the military every year, white men keep paying taxes, and engaging in the consumer culture. They keep watching sportsball and listening to rap music.Once you free your mind of this trap, it‚Äôs actually liberating. You are no longer trapped aboard a sinking ship, desperately trying to bail it out. You have transcended and joined your own ship, with other dissidents.The one thing not in doubt is the human capital of white males. Sometimes it seems like the best solution is pull a Russia when they burned down Moscow to prevent the French invasion. White men can rebuild, the rest can‚Äôt. But I‚Äôd rather see whites living in straw huts than seeing beautiful old cities and apartments completely infested with blacks and Mexicans living on our dime.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶any sense of duty or obligation to the country is not only meaningless, it is foolish. ‚ÄùI have come not to praise America, but to bury it.Bear in mind this is a play on a eulogy.  America‚Äôs ‚Äúides of March‚Äù happened on March 4, 1861. We‚Äôre just now Noticing.Unlike Caeasar, America survived the knives in the backs of several million of her dead and maimed sons and their families, but the infection of anti-republican ideas soon finished the job. On some undisclosed day soon after Reconstruction, she succumbed.Unlike Caesar, America was denied an honorable burial and a eulogy, for even in death her memory was powerful, commanding the loyalties of millions of men and women mighter than us.  Tomorrow still belonged to those who could harness that loyalty.Those who‚Äôve spent any time here know the next chapters. Third Founding America was re-animated by (((necromancers))) &amp; their shabbos familiars. Scofield, Zangwill, Lazarus, Schiff, Wilson, Marcuse, FDR‚Ä¶  The list of infernals animating the Second Founding skin-suit goes on, but you get the drift.LIke so many victims in zombie cinema, America‚Äôs children still rush to embrace their Founding Fathers &amp; their Motherland, not noticing the dead eyes and funny smell until it‚Äôs too late.  The veterans of a dozen pointless wars. CivNats. Shitlibs.  James Fields, RAM &amp; the Proud Boys.For we orphans who seek to re-forge a family out of betrayal and tragedy, the first task is to break the spell, scatter their ashes &amp; honor their memory.Denial, anger, bargaining, depression &amp; acceptance.  We see a lot of the first four around here.  Step 2‚Äôs obviously my sweet spot.Still working on step 5.

                    Goes without saying but best keep it that way.  Keep in mind they want us thinking and posting in that vein.  Be careful what you say and how you say it.  Certain subjects are best left unmentioned,especially anything that can be taken as a threat of future actions.
As they ramp up the fear &amp; smear tactics, we‚Äôre going to have to accept that 2A things we could post on a Facebook Tea Party account 5 years ago are best left entirely unsaid in our Current Clown Year and our three-ring near future.

            I am somewhere between 3, jumping 4, to go to 5.  I will know I am truly at 5 when I cancel my voter registration.  I am almost there, but I have been wanting to keep it, to have the opportunity to lend my vote to disruptive people and ideas, when they are on the ballot.  Seeing Trump‚Äôs name on the ballot a few years back made me smile and all happy inside, because of the ‚Äúf*ck you‚Äù factor of it being there for me to choose.Now there is voter harvesting here in CA, and I‚Äôll be damned if I am going to give in to that.  So I guess I‚Äôll be on the voter rolls for a bit longer, yet.

        Once the atheists kill God, we seek his replacement.  Humanism! Once biology and history exposes the imperfections of humanity, we seek a replacement. Patriotism! Love of country. ‚ÄúI pledge allegiance‚Ä¶‚Äù. Once diversity, multi culti and open borders kills patriotism we seek a replacement. Families! Once feminisms, trans and gays kill marriage we seek a replacement. Apathy. Post modernism. Nihilism. Drugs, booze, video games, porn, suicide, Netflix, football. Ennui.

            Ifrank-Is it possible that the seemingly straight line downward, as you outlined, is turned upward by the buoyancy (force?) drawing people back to family? The greatest destructive period you outlined is Nihilism, IMO. The others do have pain and destruction at personal perimeters but they appear to be societal disruptions. But nihilism affects me personally, physically and deeply.My red-pilled frame of reference is much more myopic toward my family. Thoughts of legacy and their preservation keep me moving, as I‚Äôve divorced myself from a sense of civic duty, patriotism (the modernist version) and ‚Äúchanging my community‚Äù (that was an ugly divorce). Even my Christian sense of duty has forced me to study ‚Äúloving my neighbor‚Äù more deeply. And I see the rot that is the culture and instruction of the Christian Industrial Complex.Based on your diagnosis, what do you suggest is the proper response? What are you doing now, that I can learn from?The good news is it‚Äôs all upside now! Evil is on full display, unabashedly, giving me clear targets and areas of avoidance until they can be engaged from positions of strength.

            Fr seraphim rose has a book called Nihilism: the root of the revolution of the modern age. Well worth reading.
‚ÄúNo sensitive observer is unaware that men, in the Nihilist era more than ever before, have made of earth an image of Hell; and those who are aware of dwelling in the Abyss do not hesitate to call their state Hell. The torture and miseries of this life are indeed a foretaste of Hell, even as the joys of a Christian life‚Äìjoys which the Nihilist cannot even imagine, so remote are they from his experience-are a foretaste of Heaven.‚Äù

        Of course, this is why the ruling class has abandoned so much of what is considered the duties of a ruling class. They have no duties.Which goes hand-in-hand with less and less actual power: they get a script handed out that they have to follow if they want a career in politics, and when your role as a law-maker is thus undermined, the only meaningful activity left is to concentrate on your bank account.This is, of course, much worse in Europe, where you have most of the important legislation phoned in from Brussels. About five years ago, Britain was hit by an expense scandal in parliament and several parliamentarians told the Graun ‚Äì anonymously ‚Äì that the party whip would pressure newbies to use up every last dime of their expense allowance, because having someone in the group not dirtied up, someone in a position to point sanctimonious fingers, made the colleagues uncomfortable.

        Dave Rubin started from somewhere around center-left, but has been drifting rightward. He still earnestly hopes that what he wants to believe can come true, but no longer really thinks it‚Äôs so, and he‚Äôs honest enough that when he gets mugged by reality, he admits he was wrong before. He‚Äôs been mugged by cancel-culture. He hasn‚Äôt yet been mugged by proposition citizens. Maybe a walking vacation in Dearborn is in order??

                AIU, despite being a leftist is pretty good on most subjects we care about.  Among leftists, he is somewhat a bit of fresh air.  His audience is mostly centrists/cuck types, but unlike Dave, he stands up to his own audience.  He doesn‚Äôt pretend to be something he‚Äôs not. If all leftists were like AIU, we would be in much better shape.

        Thank you, Z.Owning the excitement of what comes next for us feels a strange response to realizing I was embracing a memory of America, not Her true state and likely future (without dissident alternatives).I fly the flag now because it‚Äôs been there for so long that taking it down would be a tell. It‚Äôs odd to me that I‚Äôm not sad about that anymore. It‚Äôs mentally freeing to look ahead clearly.Now, the work to rebuild feels overwhelming. I‚Äôve suffered from paralysis by analysis.

                La Jolla‚Äôs largely resisted outright decay ‚Äì lots of $$$ buys lots of social insulation. Still San Diego‚Äôs Malibu, for now.  Noticeably darker though, the La Jolla residents that I know quietly lament the influx of Persian and Han nouveau riche though few will say so in mixed company.  As with every affluent CA neighborhood, it seems, it‚Äôs also much gayer than when I first moved to Diego in the 90‚Äôs.

                RWC. I appreciate the frustration you expressed. So, we are left with lamenting, or laying the ground work (planning) for an overt, future building stage. For me and my house, we are working hard to become more durable in the following areas: relational, spiritual, physical, resourcefulness.I‚Äôve learned so much from Exile, Lineman, Zman, Bison, PA, and others that my family‚Äôs future is, at minimum, dependent on my decisions, work and leadership. I lead my tribe. So I‚Äôm focused there. I hope to find others doing the same work but I‚Äôm not dependent on it‚Ä¶as much as I desire it.Also, to add to your sentiment, we are far from an emerging philosophical consensus that would unify us, and the men that it would naturally bring with it. So, yes, no clear direction among the red-pilled, no clear unity of principles and standards, and certainly no clear singular leader(s) or groups. At this point, that‚Äôs a Feature not a Bug. Embrace it, do what you can. Everything is your responsibility. No one is coming.

                The ‚ÄòFounders‚Äô were men, not Gods, and they ‚Äògave‚Äô us nothing, other than a system worked out by compromise and quite a bit of propaganda, intended to increase the federal government‚Äôs power and rein in that of the states.‚Äô  Rebuild is, I would suggest, the wrong term, expressing an intent to begin with the same, flawed foundation and copy what led us here in the first place.  We need to begin anew, and we start with declaring our prime imperative:  Our people ‚Äì not liberty/license, not dying with the most Chinese-made toys, and not equality which does not exist in nature.

        ‚ÄúA bad habit dissidents have inherited from conservatives is to instinctively dispute the claims made by our enemies. If a cosmopolitan globalist says X, the tendency is to argue that X is wrong.‚ÄùThe leftist Establishment insists abortion should be legal and available, so reflexive cucks say abortion is evil. Never mind that without abortion there would be tens of thousands of future feral ‚Äúyouth‚Äù spawned every year to single teenage mothers.The leftist Establishment recognizes, sometimes, that overpopulation degrades the environment and quality of life. So reflex-action cucks insist population stabilization or reduction is sinful and anti-life. The Vatican (a different leftist Establishment) loves them.The leftist Establishment acknowledges that the pharma industry is no more greedy or manipulative than any other business and, regardless of its profit seeking, is on the whole a boon to life and health. So knee-jerk cucks are outraged about vaccines and meds until they hear a frightening message from their doctor.We have met the enemy and ‚Ä¶ you know the rest.

        Zman‚Äôs excellent article motivates me to post this on-topic comment, which I had previously submitted to CTH but which did not make it through the censors.‚ÄúDems ‚Ä¶ are finished as a party or just about finished.‚ÄùNo, they are not. Demography is destiny. Western Civilization cannot be maintained without a majority of Western people. Birthrates are what the they are. Immigration rates are what they are. The Marxist blank slate theory is incorrect.Dem‚Äôs *might* be held off in the short-term (4-20 years) with intelligent and vigorous defensive leadership, but the communist-globalist coalition is in possession of all the control nodes of our civilization except the courts, which thanks to Pres. Trump‚Äôs heroic efforts it is fair to classify as ‚Äòcontested‚Äô. The establishment GOP party of stupid continues to worship at the altar of ‚Äòcheap labor over all so I can be rich when I kick off to Hell‚Äô and continues to import hordes of foreigners who overwhelmingly vote to abolish America. Civic or economic nationalism is fake nationalism. They come from real tribes and real nations, and the vast majority have no interest in leaving theirs to join a fake one. They vote for their own tribal and national interests, which means voting for the Democratic Party which now defines itself as a coalition of anti-Americans.It is time to recognize that the republic our founding fathers gave us is dead. We live in an empire now. Just like there was a Roman nation that lived within a Roman Empire comprising many nations, we the American nation are one of many nations within the Amerikan Empire. Historically, we are VERY far from being the first national people to find ourselves being ruled over by contemptuous and hostile foreign imperial elites. We have 3 choices. Choice 1 is get rid of the empire and establish a 2nd American Republic. Choice 2 is to resign ourselves to reorganizing for national survival in an imperial age, knowing that all empires die, and that new nation-states always arise from the death of empires. Choice 3 is to do nothing, in which case we will be destroyed.Most nations that ever were, are no more. Either their broken remnants were absorbed into more confident and vigorous nations (the most likely choice 3 outcome for us) or they were wiped out like most of the Orthodox Christian peoples in the Byzantine Empire which used to encompass the eastern Mediterranean. Check out Raymond Ibrahim‚Äôs ‚ÄúSword and Scimitar‚Äù.

        The US was a blood and soil country, at least of a sort. The first Congress restricted immigration to free white men of good character, and that general rule held for a long time.
The only thing I would add to Z Man‚Äôs thesis is to clarify that the ‚Äúproposition‚Äù of our ‚Äúnation‚Äù has nothing to do with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, etc. The proposition is the one Z mentioned: economic, and it can involve work or freeloading.

        Accepting that you are no longer an ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù or even that a true country no longer exists is vital. Everything becomes much clearer. You understand the task at hand ‚Äì build a new community, a new people.You also understand what stands in your way and who stands in your way.

        Thought-provoking. I‚Äôd more or less gone along with the meaning of my youth ‚Äì that we who call ourselves Americans were those who had chosen to be here, or who had history as an American. Which, was the idea that we would defend her principles to the death.Spending $ makes you American? I didn‚Äôt even like that idea when the politicians decided to allow emigration to those who agreed to invest in American business.I grew up in a neighborhood filled with relatively recent immigrants. About 20% of so of my friends were just off the boat a few years. They, and their families, bought into the American Idea.Today? They‚Äôre scabs, leaving one country to suck at the teat of another. No loyalty. No respect for OUR traditions. No desire to contribute to making this nation better.Just gimme, gimme, gimme.

                Further, it is simply factually incorrect that any group of people ever bound themselves together based an acceptance of a set of propositions.
The social contract was an interesting model built by Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, but it does not describe reality.  Human nature doesn‚Äôt work that way.

        Excellent observations. Now analyze and predict. Where are we likely to be headed? Will the nascent dissident movement right the ship in time? Or is it more likely that a hot tyranny will arise? Will we self segregate, or get culled, or perhaps forced to merge into the herd (see Chinese treatment of Uighurs as an example)? What‚Äôs the best use of your time and energy right now? Is it chit-chatting at the local dissident coffee klatch? Or is it making yourself more robust and resilient?

Yes, indeed.  Look at the monstrous paper-pile required to obtain ‚ÄúReal‚Äù ID‚Äìwhich allows entry into airliners and Federal buildings (and that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs good for.)
Being born here, paying taxes here, building businesses here, speaking the language here, being able to point out the gravestones of parents, grand-parents (etc.) here‚Äìnone of that is worth spit.

                I remember when I was a civnat listening to Bill Krystol say that we should grant citizenship to any foreigners who joined our military to fight in the Middle East.
As a civnat, I had no grounds upon which to argue with him, but living in California I knew on a visceral level that I didn‚Äôt want to live in Mexico, which is what he was advocating.

        The thing about ‚Äúgoing back‚Äù is it‚Äôs going to be very messy.  Once this current system finally collapses, the new system that arises will only be able to sustain a small fraction of the existing population.   People in general do not have the survival skills they once had, and could fall back on in times of need.

        Damn, Z! How can you crank out such insights/incites day after day.  Thank you.Yes, you can red pill folks by analyzing our ruling overlords, their relationship to production and citizenship, or lack of.The red pill that bit me was just plain old demographics. Throw that in your red pill pile. I realize that‚Äôs a long shot for most normies.  It was Steyn 10 years ago then Derb that through simple numbers, charts and graphs influenced me to become a ‚ÄúDemographic Bore‚Äù and it became clear there was no evading demographic reality for me, and for reality.  Yea, I‚Äôm an outlier.Graphs and charts for:1) The numbers of invading Hispanics tallied up year upon year.  I also believed my eyes as I watched California flip. As Derb said driving through the Central Valley, you can drive for miles and never see printed English or hear spoken English.2) The great graph of African population growth to the end of century.   Ah Oh‚Ä¶.A Lifeboat world coming for both Europe and America that may eventually force some decisions we have not faced or begun to come to terms with. Or not. Just flood ‚Äòem in and ignore the consequences.A few will cross the great divide under the influence of Demographics.

            Of course we are. The very existence of a Congressional Black Caucus and a Congressional Latino Caucus is consistent with the diagnosis that America is no longer one country, and more significantly, that these new developing nations within the country do not see white rule as legitimate and would rather elect their own people to represent their direct interests.

The problem for our side to get what you say is a nation for heritage whites means war. It won‚Äôt happen if we do nothing ‚Äì we just get exterminated.

        When someone mentions an immigrant acquaintance as an ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù I make the point of asking them, ‚ÄúDo you mean a citizen?‚Äù This usually raises an eyebrow as the speaker has no concept of the difference.  I usually clarify, ‚ÄúThey are a citizen, you are an American.‚ÄùStrangely enough it doesn‚Äôt come off as antagonistic and actually gives me an opening to plant seeds of doubt.In all fairness, I‚Äôve met a number of immigrants that actually do wholeheartedly become Americans. That may tick off the blood and soil folks here, but there it is. Some are more Roman than the Romans so to speak. There are a great many of my fellow Americans who I‚Äôd gladly deport regardless of blood and soil. That being said, the number of immigrants allowed in should be from only select groupings, minuscule in number, and stringently parsed.

            Yup.  All of my grandparents immigrated here and they and their children were very fine Americans after the usual ‚Äòbreak-in‚Äô time.
That gives rise to the real question here, which is ‚ÄúWhy the binary between ‚Äòblood-soil‚Äô and ‚Äòproposition‚Äô?  PJBuchanan often spoke and wrote about ‚Äòblood-soil‚Äô, obviously including his grand-parents, but they were immigrants (and fine Americans.)
So they, in fact, were ‚Äúproposition‚Äù or ‚Äúmagic dirt‚Äù people AND Americans?

                The answer is genetic similarity to the existing population of the USA.  Your ancestors and Pat‚Äôs were close enough genetically to assimilate.  The Irish and Italians were the outer limit of what groups could be assimilated.  God knows it was not clear that those groups could, but they eventually did.  Any groups with a further genetic similarity from the ethnic core of the USA cannot, in general, become part of our nation, as blacks demonstrate.

                    Americans have always been culturally distinctive, and individuals from all sorts of places and cultures have been able to join and assimilate successfully, one by one.  But when large outside groups move in quickly, the host culture changes dramatically, and in an atomizing fashion.  That phenomenon has been weaponized against our host culture,

        I would put it differently ‚Äì simply ask them to define the proposition.I could make the case durning my Grandparents‚Äô time that it was Freedom, the Puritan ethics of hard work and thrift, Acquiring useful skills and knowledge (what education used to do) and other civic virtues like charity and volunteering ‚Äì the Elks, Lions Club, American Legion, VFW did things.With the influx of the new people, what is the proposition that Chuck Schumer and Rashida Talib and Rand Paul would all agree to, as well as the DACA kids?So what Dave Rubin would point to is not merely a salad bowl, which at least contains vegetables, with maybe a few other edibles, but a rubbish heap with an admixture of lots of broken trash and rotting food.

        Absolutely.  But it‚Äôs only a paper GDP gain, not a real one.  For businesses like McDonalds, Taco Bell, Home Depot and Walmart, it‚Äôs a material gain, as there are more mouths to feed and stack cinderblocks, but since these people are merely consumers with negative value, it‚Äôs actually a balance sheet transfer, to these businesses, religions and non-profit groups from the governments.  GDP paper gains can go for a long time without being questioned.  The Soviet Union was showing paper GDP gains as it was collapsing, even when entire hospitals were going without new syringes.

        Excellent article. This is why talk of ‚Äòamnesty‚Äô is a joke. Illegal aliens will not register to become ‚Äòcitizens‚Äô of a geographical area which imposes an obligation of taxation while gaining no additional benefits for citizenship. Legacy america will continue to bear the tax burden imposed by its rulers until national dissolution.  On a personal note, I recently ignored a jury summons for the first time in 45 years on the basis of having concluded that the social contract between The State and myself had broken down. I realize how corrosive such an attitude is; but I also recognize the stark realities in front of me.

        While I agree that America is now a prepositional nation, it still has the trappings of a real nation. The Mayflower, the City on the Hill, even ‚ÄúAmerican conservativism is the defense of liberalism‚Äù are hold overs of Massachusetts. If you aren‚Äôt the descendant of Puritans, then the actual history of your people is wrapped up in this myth.White Americans will have to excise these ideas to advance forward. This is easier for Southrons, but the worship of St. Reagan makes even that difficult. I have no idea how later immigrant groups like the Italians and Irish will separate themselves from the Yankee Empire.

                Reagan‚Äôs biggest mistakes were1) increasing the  Social Security withholding from ~2% to ~ 15%, because it was underfunded, rather than letting it die somehow.2) amnesty for 11 million illegal aliens
Just like Nixon‚Äôs biggest mistakes were going off the Gold standard, creating new bureaucracies (EPA e.g.).

                                This has been a perennial problem since the founding of the US.A bunch of people who preferred rebellion and civil war to paying taxes now find out they have to pay for government.And no, it‚Äôs not possible to roll things back tax wise and maintain a high tech society. If you have genetic engineering, networked computers , advanced  chemistry, robots  and nuclear power you have a big state to keep them in check.All that complexity is expensive. Worse we not have a population capable of maintaining it, demography and drugs being the main culprits here but it‚Äôs deeper than that.Our culture doesn‚Äôt support the taxes or social order needed  for taxes so as we grow more complex and  urban it‚Äôs closer to game overI for one welcome our new Amish overlords.Well actually I won‚Äôt be here but still.As for a solution.Simple.The US must be 80-90% White, and have a right wing dictatorship that isn‚Äôt money cucked and isn‚Äôt capitalist but economic nationalist and capable of thinking long term.This may not even stop the decline but it will buffer it.How you get there is obvious but unthinkable  and thus impractical at the current time so we won‚Äôt even try for a rather long time.Still  there you go. Problem and solution.

                                        You don‚Äôt live in 1776 anymore . You cannot and will not anywhere on this green earth be able to avoid government or taxation.The best you can hope for is to make the corruption and taxation work in your benefit somewhat and maybe to keep in check.As far as our history goes, the US  had a mini civil war in 1794 over Whiskey Taxes . The Feds  had  their  hand up distillers backsides before the US was 2 decades in.This has been our history, tax cheats and grifters found a nation for tax cheats and grifters and find out they can‚Äôt pay the bills because everyone wants to cheat and grift.You can‚Äôt make the state small enough and one small enough to keep the  Libertarians, Minarchists, small state types happy will endanger everyone and we will just end up corporate property of some multinational or experimented on for profit.In the end the people in charge Right or Left whoever wins will be authoritarian  , they will tax people, spend the money for what they see to be the public good and they will regulate. That‚Äôs life.As to the immediate situation, economic liberals and libertarians are not part of the Right anyway and don‚Äôt belong with dissidents any more than Charlottesville tiki torch nazis did.

                            Firewire, that is not correct.  The statement at that time was that SS was ‚Äúfixed‚Äù into the next century‚Äîand that statement was correct.  It was obviously a concession that the can was being kicked down the road,  however, the law that was passed did change/limit the downside outcome.The law now states that should funds run short, the benefits will reduce to match income, i.e., a reduction will occur across the board to come in line with receipts.  Currently the best estimate of the payment reduction is 23% taking effect perhaps as late as 2030 or so.In a sense, SS is not broken since it always produces income and the law requires it to match outflow to  inflow‚Äîalbeit, the later recipients are getting less and less of a bang for their SSI payments.Medicare however was never such a beast and the payments made into it were never realistic in the extreme.  Probably one of the reasons (hidden) there is such a push for Medicare for all‚Äîto mask the need for millennials and other later cohorts to pay for Boomers and gen X‚Äôers.

            Part of the problem is that most White folk are mutts. I can trace my ancestry back to the Mayflower on one grandfather‚Äôs side, to Appalachian scotch irish peasants on one grandmothers side, to Germans from the early 19th century on the other grandfathers side, and early 20th century slavs on the other grandmothers side.
A large percentage of white Americans have similar muttish backgrounds. So mythmaking requires the ‚Äúmelting pot‚Äù for them to feel like they have a people at all.

                There‚Äôs a commonality between our Euro ancestors as well as their American descendants running from similar genetic currents in the last 10k years, the Indo-Euros, Greece, Rome &amp; Medieval Europe, among other things.  That‚Äôs more than enough mythic material to draw from, and we have our frontiersmen ancestors here to honor as well as modern heroes once we make a point of identifying them.  We can and must replace the Second Founding mythos for our successor generations. It looks like Gen-Z is already rejecting their conditioning.  We need to find something better than cynical irony-bro narcissism to fill the void they feel.

        Re:‚Äúa nation is defined by a people with a common heritage, a common set of ancestors. The way forward is to go back to the most basic form of human organization, the nation.‚ÄùI have no problem with this statement ‚Äì at all.There is a problem however.Exactly how far down the stack of civic nationalism that has been built up ‚Äì do we have to devolve IN THE US ‚Äì to get back to that point where we have a people defined by a common heritage with common ancestors?Within the entirety of North America ‚Äì I‚Äôd imagine the Quebecois will have the easiest time of this.  If you‚Äôve got a French last name you can likely trace back your ancestors and heritage in a clear line ‚Äì especially in Quebec proper.  If you‚Äôre talking about people with French surnames over the border here in the US ‚Äì even just within New England ‚Äì you‚Äôre going to have a much harder time.I‚Äôve got a pretty good idea of my family lineage ‚Äì having it traced back by my grandmother to before the Revolution.  It‚Äôs almost all Scottish, English and with a little bit of German mixed in. There are a number of spots spread across New England that are named after people with surnames that exist in my family tree.  So if the latecomers start getting uppity my ultimate argument is going to be ‚Äù here before you ‚Äú.But for what is probably the majority of people in this country ‚Äì that is simply not going to be true.  Even if you just stick with the white people.Seems like a big problem.

        OT ‚Äì Scandza Oslo Saturday 11/2 ‚Äì Human Biodiversity conference, Kevin MacDonald, Helmuth Nyborg, Ed DuttonAntifa crashed this event as with Copenhagen but due to some combo of our venue selection and the Norwegian police, we had a larger perimeter. They weren‚Äôt standing within 20 yards of our front doors ala Copenhagen and their background howling and gibbering didn‚Äôt disturb the speakers.On arriving I heard Greg Johson had been arrested for Hate-Speech Pre-Crime (apparently due to some Orwellian Minority Reporters called Filter Nyhete, a Scandi counterpart to Britain‚Äôs odious Hope Not Hate).Greg Johnson is one of the least plausible candidates for the ‚Äúradicalization‚Äù fear and smear.  He can and should sue these Soros sock-puppets and drag them through discovery to ascertain who in Scandinavian law enforcement and media is working with these trolls and where their funding comes from.This was simply ‚Äúpour encourager les autres.‚Äù  They think giving Greg the Assange treatment will keep the rest of us in line and they hope we start seeing Scandinavia as difficult territory for future organizing, much like the shabbos-yabbos in British law enforcement and the Feds with Fields and the RAM guys etc‚Ä¶This public-private kosher sandwich of ‚Äúanti-hate groups‚Äù and Western Stasi-cops needs to be exposed as a political hack, a black-hat exploit of the political mainframe that gives the lie to all the self-serving pieties spouted by the governments of ‚ÄúFree World.‚ÄùCheck out national-justice.com regarding the use of ‚Äúopen source‚Äù intel by our neo-Pinkertons in Western law enforcement.

Climber prosecutors leverage this kompomat to push plea bargains or take it to show trial where a jury of basic-bitch civnats, shitlibs &amp; mystery meats and a crooked judge whose political ambitions are exceeded only by those of the prosecutor see that the sausage of justice gets made.It‚Äôs a more kinetic variation of the American private public kosher sandwich  where Silicon Valley and Wall Street team up to impose internal exile on Hate Speakers while Charlie Cuck and B‚ÄôNai Brett Stevens shuck &amp; jive about ‚Äúprivate companies.‚ÄùAs I commented at CC earlier, the victims of these thuggish clowns need to push legal actions for damages and drag these guys in discovery ‚Äì who are your contacts, who funds you, how many times have you slept at Jeff Epstein‚Äôs house and where was Ehud Barak on the night in question, etc‚Ä¶Send the message that if  (((they))) want to keep playing rough, we will make the goyim know.5 to 10 for one of our guys means 110 for all of yours.

                A multiplicity of small, lower cost lawsuits would probably be more effective than a few high profile cases.  The system is set up to funnel single big cases to cherry picked crooked judges.  It doesn‚Äôt work as well when dozens of lawsuits in out-of-the-way jurisdictions need to be stage-managed.  As the CA RAM case showed, there are still some judges out there who aren‚Äôt bought &amp; paid for.Lawsuits don‚Äôt need to cost millions. Exposing the tactics that drive up costs is part of the Noticing process. They fear publicity and disclosure so give them publicity and disclosure.We need lawyers willing to stand up for their people as much as any other skilled professional in this movement, probably more so.  One of the hardest challenges for Our Guys is finding a lawyer willing to put his name on a ‚ÄúWhite Nationalist‚Äù case.  We‚Äôre a long Woke way from Skokie days.

        Past Is the Future‚ÄúIf a cosmopolitan globalist says X, the tendency is to argue that X is wrong.‚ÄùThanks for the opening, so let me go O/T about a small something that‚Äôs bugging me:I pretty much have to disagree entirely with the idea that ‚Äúthere is no historical or archaeological evidence that the events in the Bible occurred‚Äù.I find it all to be true.  Not in the way it‚Äôs currently interpreted, but that the events and scenarios are all based on real-world happenings.Many are a collage; many were borrowed, adapted, or someone else‚Äôs story; many were shaped to suit an agenda of the author, his backers, or his intended audience; many origins were forgotten and names were substituted.That doesn‚Äôt matter, any of it.What matters is that the memories themselves were preserved, in one form or another.  Some of these threads go back to the Ice Ages; memories from dozens of extinct cultures still live, kept alive in a personable, legible form for both commoner and king.That it used differing styles of storytelling, ones that must be translated to suit the tastes of modern university dialects- well, get over it, smart people.  If you want fanciful, go to the stories of the Norse, the Greek, the Hindu- now those are entirely made up, with little to no guide for the real world.

            Alabama shares a huge border with Mississippi and Georgia, which both have massive Black population. Although the Alabama-Mississippi border mostly consists of whites, it‚Äôs still a turbulent spot. In the event of national breakdown, which may or may not happen, the Louisiana-Mississippi is going to be one of the bloodiest places in this country.

                        Seems like you‚Äôre in the distinct minority that recognizes this problem.I don‚Äôt see establishing a nation ‚Äì in a land area surrounded by your enemies ‚Äì as a particularly good long term strategy.  In essence it‚Äôs just a running away tactic.People live in certain areas for real reasons.  The fact that the interior of the country is not as densely populated as the coasts has some real economic/social/human factor reasons behind it.You ignore these at your long term peril.Here‚Äôs what all the dumbwits who think that establishing a new white homeland in the interior REALLY need to think out:  why would you put ALL of the white people in one place ‚Äì surrounded by your enemies ‚Äì with no sea access?Are you some kind of troll?

        I loathe any white man that joins the military, specifically any who join the ground forces, the Army and Marines.  Why fight for an empire that tells you everyday that it hates you, considers you to be the devil, and is working in every way practical to subjugate and ultimately eliminate you?  You‚Äôre killing, dying, and getting maimed for what?  White boycott of the Army and Marines.  Bring the boys home.  The system wouldn‚Äôt dare to play globocop with Sgt. La‚Äôkisha and Pvt. Pedro, and if they tried they wouldn‚Äôt do it for long.  This country really started going down the tubes when the elite got a taste of being players on the world stage during WW2 and the Cold War.  That‚Äôs when the nation became just another colony to exploit for the benefit of the New Imperialists.  (It also allowed Europe to fall back into self-indulgence.)  Boycott the military, knock those props out from underneath them.  For those of you with lingering patriotism who are slightly disturbed by the idea just know that it‚Äôs going to happen in a few decades anyway,  third-world America won‚Äôt be competitive either militarily or economically,  so you‚Äôe just bringing the inevitable forward by a few decades, and saving some lives,  foriegn and domestic.

        The Ruling Class are experts at devaluing things: gender roles, sexual roles, currency, etc. The notion of ‚Äòbad money drives out good‚Äô has been around for a long time and the technique for devaluation entails proliferation (inflation) of whatever is to be devalued. The counter to the devaluation process is quarantine/containment (from the devalued thing) followed by revaluation within the containment zone where the ‚Äòidentity‚Äô of the thing is now stable and no longer subject to the effects of proliferation. To bring this down from the abstract level, ‚Äòidentity movements‚Äô were the contents of ‚Äòidentity‚Äô are restricted to specific, limited interpretations, is a form of containment/revaluation of the currency of ‚Äòidentity‚Äô.

                And who is going to give us our homeland? That little tidbit is always missing from Z‚Äôs postings.
Really what is the incentive of the ruling class and globo-homo to give us some sort of shitty homeland in a sea of brownskinned savages, we don‚Äôt have any real leverage short of going 308 on them.

                    Who ‚Äúgave‚Äù our ancestors a homeland?  All land ownership boils down to the ability to defend and make use of it.  There‚Äôs plenty of North America that they don‚Äôt care enough about and/or can‚Äôt effectively occupy.  They can‚Äôt open an FBI field office in every podunk backwater in the country.  Canada has vast open spaces ‚Äì 80% of Canadians live within 200 miles of the US border.  Porous borders work both ways.  They also have to first identify Us as Us rather than just some guys living in a backwater.

I know I am not planning that. They most likely would not have me. Besides I want to see my new nation (Appalachians) here in America carve out a homeland. I will fight for that.

            We must create spaces where our people can be an overwhelming majority.
Jared Taylor says to accomplish this we must have a space where we:* restore freedom of association (repeal 1964 civil rights act)* repeal affirmative action and disparate impact laws* enforce immigration laws
That seems like a lot to accomplish in our current system, which motivates others to investigate more unorthodox strategies.
It‚Äôs a long shot, but what are the alternatives?

                We all have our lists of priorities and systemic to-do lists.  FWIW, I see nothing wrong with Taylor‚Äôs list.  All of this is putting the cart before the horse though.  We‚Äôre at the stage where we can start building very small rural communities with an eye toward broader organization later.  My to-do list includes a network of diaspora travelers who help link these scattered communities together. Every one of these outposts is going to be doing things its own way for the foreseeable future, and that‚Äôs once they get off the ground.  As I mentioned in a number of discussions at Scandza, we‚Äôre looking for low-profile, multi-generational strategy, Soviet dissident style, growing parallel institutions, etc‚Ä¶ and preparing the next generations to take advantage when the System starts to OD on its own supply.
