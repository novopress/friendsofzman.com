        At bottom, the feminist feels she is raped because the bad boy-rogue-cad that her ideology hates and which her DNA craves pushed her buttons and moved on to the next conquest. Essentially, she hates herself; there’s more satisfaction in changing the world than in changing yourself. And a bigger support group.

        I don’t feel sympathy for Nungesser at all. He placed himself in a situation THREE times where there was an accusation of “sexual misconduct”. To be clear, I don’t think, based on the available evidence, that he is a rapist. But just like the drunk-girl-at-frat-party has to bear some measure of responsibility for allowing herself to be in a situation where she can be taken advantage of, Nungesser has to bear responsibility for his situation.

            Well, there has been some chatter that Sulkowicz colluded with others who accused him with other charges.  He said, she said never really ends.

        From the court doc (they’re online), it seem less a case of “Boy finally bags Girl” than “Boy commits unforgivable crime of blowing off Girl to chase different Girl”, after a prolonged sort of relationship.At least that’s the story he’s selling. You might note he’s suing the university (deep pocket), not her.

        They’re right about the root problem. The guy obviously has loose zipper syndrome, which appears to run rampant among younger (&gt;60) generations.

        I hope the young German wins his suit against the University and it makes him rich. He has been humiliated around the world and deserves to be compensated.

            I too hope he wins if he is innocent of all charges. But, the system that has been created these days allows any situation to be judged again and again and revised continually in ‘a new light’
It is similar to the way the Soviets re-wrote history or airbrushed people out of the photos of the gang of miserable old men on the steps of the Kremlin. There is in the leftie world no such thing as a fact, only interpretations and re-interpretations and new ‘thoughts’ to propel their silly agenda forward.

                Then again, the bloke who shot Trayvon Martin was found innocent and so was the police officer from Ferguson. The filth mob was at their respective doors baying for blood too. I’m clutching at straws I know but I still feel like the dyke is holding back the sea. The little boy is running out of fingers though.

        I think that you are the first commentator, liberal or conservative, who has pointed out the obvious: that is is about rejection/stigma rather than violence.Based on her texts, she was pretty kinky.   My guess is that Deutsch-boy bragged or tattled, word got back around, her reputation was on the line, and she went into “deny everything, admit nothing, make counter-accusations” mode.  The SJWs picked up her story, and from there, she was propelled by their blandishments and praise (your story is so important to advance the cause… oh, you’re so brave!).This stuff is Salem witch trials meets post-modernism — hysterics (usually young women) making insane claims of abuse that fail to stand up to investigation.  After a few more of these stories get dismantled, they will go the way of Satanic Ritual Abuse and the McMartin Preschool case.
