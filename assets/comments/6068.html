        That is some machinery that needs smashing.  Isn’t that the whole point of Trump?

        “Given that he and the Encyclopedists are the guys in charge, betting against them is probably foolish.”
The Neocons might have all the Money and MSM on their side but Americans have become more aware  in how the things really work thanks to the internet and alternative media.

        Your use of Hari Seldon and the Encyclopedists is interesting. You are casting the GOP establishment as the Encyclopedists and (I assume) Trump as the Mule. Yes? Now the question becomes–is there a secret Second Foundation (GOP Establishment) around to nudge things back on track?

Your use of Hari Seldon is perfect. A psychohistorian who predicts the downfall of a decaying empire, and places the kernel of a new foundation in place.
Yea, the trajectory of al-Amerikwa is clear; my only comment in the adverse is that Kristol is a mealy-mouthed insider, who’d be better portrayed as one of the court ass-sniffers in Trantor
Thanks for your blog, Merry Christmas

        Huh — old Left and old Right meeting in the middle to save their country from globalist weirdos.  I seem to recall this happening before.  Well, not me personally — I wasn’t alive in 1920s Germany — but Ididgo to a high school history class once.
Fun times.

        Re Kristol and Murdoch: Murdoch’s money established the Weekly Standard and kept it alive for almost twenty years through regular subsidies. But, Murdoch then sold the magazine to Phil Anschutz who has carried it since. And he undoubtedly is essential to keeping the publication alive.
Given his wealth (high up on the Forbes list), I have always been surprised how little public attention Anschutz has attracted.
He is an Evangelical Christian of Volga German descent. Born in Kansas, he owns a great deal of ranch land in the WEst.

        I was thinking the other night of a third  party, and how difficult It would be to create one. Having one person run for President as a third party candidate is not the same as building an entire party structure. The goal for an effective third  party would  include a percent captain in every percent in the country, A county ‘board’ a state ‘board’ and a national committee. Along with that good candidates in every partisan elected office at the municipal county state and federal level, and that includes such things as natural resource boards and school boards. Is this even possible?With that in mind perhaps it would be a good idea if the neocons and the old guard republican establishment left the party. There should be no attempt reconciliation but rather they and their kind should be  shoved out the door. and the party infrastructure and the party cash should be seized and kept from their use.We have seen with the democrats that Bernie Sanders went as far as to sue the Democratic part for  access  to voter lists.  How sweet would it be tell  the neocons and old  guard. “No those voter lists are property of the Party you just left and you have no right to them”.I think rebuilding the GOP would be easier than creating a new party. Trump probably has no interest in doing this but the people who vote for him should take advantage of the opportunity if it surfaces.

            The trouble with creating a third party is both the other (main, they argue) parties hate them with a passion. Technically, the UK has a three party set-up though hell would have to be made into skating rink before the LimpDumbs (or LibDems as they prefer) gain power, other than as we saw recently here, through a coalition in which they can whine away and imagine they are relevant. Pseudo commies like the Greens, the Welsh and the Scots Nats don’t count.So along came a true third party, the knee-jerk reaction UKIP lot but who rapidly drew withering fire from all corners because it was what the people wanted. But our system meant an impressive 4 million votes for them resulted in just one seat in parliament, thus justifying the scorn further heaped on them, especially when seat-less Farage didn’t win, resigned and was persuaded within a day to come back and lead.So that’s the problem with third parties: the media, the establishment, and organised crime (sorry, I meant existing political parties) all hate them equally. You have to have a thick skin to take that kind of flak.

                Universal suffrage does not permit public political discussion to cross the shrunken boundary which it creates. That is why the political parties are what they are. No one, for example, advocates voluntary social security, the abolition of the income tax, or anything of more recent provenance still ripe for discussion. This is a one way trip to Utopia.But even that is not enough, so many of our states have crossover primaries. The lefty, his candidates securely in place, votes in the Republican primary instead. A taste of what happened in France recently.Churchill was wrong. Democracy is not the worst form of government except all the others.

        Z, is Kristol any more than a Rupert Murdoch sock puppet?Murdoch is an open borders romantic, so Fox News, The Standard, the NY Postall toe Rupert’s party line.Before Kristol, it was Megan Kelly and the other dweebs going after The Donald.
Haley Barbour, also mentioned in the Brietbart story is surprising to me.I would have figured him for a genuine Southern conservative.
I think theAmerican Traitor Partyis still available  for a name if Bill’s still looking.

            I wonder if Kristol is just in a panic over the growing realization by voters that his gang is the problem, not the solution. I’ve been looking at polling lately and the numbers say the majority of people who vote GOP are ready to walk if they have to accept another Liberal Republican. In my reading, guys like Cruz and even Rubio to some degree, are cutting in Trumps total. Rubio’s vote are the Tea Party types who have yet to figure out he is a fink.In other words, Kristol sees what’s coming and is in a panic. If he and his gang did what they are promising, they are finished. They become pariahs. In the end, some simply go back to being Liberals while others convert again to the remain relevant.
