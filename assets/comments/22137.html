            Yeah, it’s a goddamn fantasy land out there. It really is, I just want to smack these people about, quite honestly. The weakness and fragility is epic. But the more that the lie is repeated, the more the gullible will fall for it.
It is like dealing with children.

            Escapism has become the national past time. The same people chanting that we have to vote harder are saying we have to trust harder.

                I am having a very hard time trusting even sources that I once considered solid. As a rule of thumb it seems that individual bloggers at least aren’t hampered by editors and other officials getting them to toe the line. Of course they can be de-platformed.Another good rule of thumb is whether the subject is heavily politicized. Sort of why the Wikipedia entry on aero-elasticity is no doubt much more trustworthy than the one on FDR.Peter Hitchens, even thoughThe Mail on Sundayis compromised on many things still seems solid on most topics he is allowed to mention. But he’ll be gone soon.

                    you piqued my interest, so I checked.Wikipedia DOES NOT HAVE  an article on aero-elasticity.but there is this…“The use of carbon-fibre lay-ups, designed to reduceaero-elasticityof wings, has allowed CFRP gliders to be designed to cruise at much higher speeds than those with wings made from fibreglass”.(aero-elasticity is the fluttering of rigid wings, due to turbulence in the air stream, exacerbated by inadequate structural stiffness).

                I think a big part of the escapism is really just “If you I do what you want will you please piss off and leave me alone?”
I mean, they won’t, but that’s what the hope is.   Our new global anthem should be _Let’s All Make Believe_ by Oasis

            I may end up finding one of those doctors with the unpronounceable name. You know, the kind that would okay 19 year olds medical marijuana cards for glaucoma. You don’t think Dr. Serengapatam won’t be happy to take $50 or your insurance money and then sell his now spare dose to someone else.

                    Fake vax will only work until they roll out some kind of dye that glows under a combination of wavelengths or nanoscale biochips that work like miniature RFID tags.


Same with the cards. Cheesy paper cards are for quick rollout and rapid conditioning of the rubes.


They are feverishly working on adapting chip-based cards and a central database to ensure no one can fake the vax card.


Eventually they will be able to code your vax status into the biochip mentioned above.

            A society of Cyphers. “Just put me back in the matrix…”  These are the same people who complain about the wuhan getting politicized as they call for moar coercive gubmint regulations to help rationalize their fear feelz. The growing “great divide” is becoming less metaphor and more of a reality every day. The big jab in the arm for all of us will be in having to come to terms with the facf that people close to us are choosing the gubmint issue “juicy steak” and that in doing so they not only exist in a different reality but that they are demonstrating that the comforts of that antireality are something they will protect at all costs and are thus a threat to us and ours.

A few hours after an extended family chat on Sunday, this reality landed on me hard. They (elder parents, sibling and their kids) are irretrievable. And worse, they become enemy combatants when things get hard. I’m still wrestling with how that’s going to play out. It’s good we don’t live near each other.

            It will all work to our advantage the first time—after vaccines become freely available—masks and lockdowns are required for the “season”.  At which point the normies (some anyway) will see they’ve been played.

            That’s what I’m seeing too. Normies are super excited about there being a vaccine out there.I think it’s important though to not touch the third rail of conspiracy theory stuff – and start talking about things like sterilization.There’s more than adequate and indisputable information out there to inject a high level of distrust into the typical normie head.  I usually do something like the following:” you know …. this vaccine was rushed into production.  It usually takes something like ten years to get a new vaccine fully tested and into full human use – this one is out in what – something like 4 months?  From what I know – it’s some sort of new fangled technology too – some sort of genetic code manipulation or something like that. Not sure if they have really had the time to test that thing fully.  I have heard that a couple of people have died during the trials – that pretty much always happens , so maybe nothing much to worry about.  Still though – the way I figure it is I’ll just wait it out for 6 months to a year – I’ve survived this long without one – I’m sure I can do another 6 months no problem. There will be a bunch of dumb people who run out and this stuff injected into their body – then we’ll really find out what happens.  I’ll just wait to see how that turns out.  I don’t feel like being a Thalydomide test subject”If they’re a normie -they were just thinking “I’m going to run out and get the vaccine!!”I just told them I thought they are dumb – and I’ll sit around and wait to see if they grow a second head before I do anything.

                Are you kidding? Screw the Normies. Let them go ahead and take the vaccine. The best thing we have going is this thing’s probably a disaster and people are going to start having really severe symptoms and and then something else unpredictable will happen but let them go first. More of them the better. It leaves less vaccine for you and me

                    No – I’m not kidding. But I totally agree with what you’re saying: the more normies take the vaccine and then end up dead because of it – the better it is for me. But…………. I also think that is a bit of a sensitive line to balance – you need to have a sufficient population of idiots willing to off themselves – as well as a sufficient population of people willing to push back on the whole thing once the die off starts.What I think trolling normies like I’m suggesting is doing – is giving a shove to those who are on the fence, while the totally brain dead will just get pissed off – not listen – and get themselves shot up anyway.The perfect situation would be IMHO , to have a population of skeptical but still on the fence people – who you told that things were going go really badly – who then have friends, relatives …. etc…. all dying from taking the vaccine.That would give you maximum anger for minimal input.The truth of all of this is that we won’t win the fight by ourselves.  You will need allies.  Telling somebody beforehand “don’t do that or it’s going to end up really badly” – and then having it go badly – is one way of gaining converts.

Lots and lots of research going on here with regard to COVID, the vaccine, etc.I do not know a single nurse who wants this vaccine right now, if ever.It is critical that we steer clear of conspiracy theories.  There is an abundance of reasons for people to refuse this vaccine.  When people ask my opinion, I talk about:How hard the scientists have worked to create the vaccine BUT  a year ago, few even knew about this virus and it takes YEARS to know how drugs/vaccines affect people and they simply have not had enough time.  Do they really know how it affects elderly white men who have had kidney transplants?  Black women with sickle cell disease?  Anyone of any race with various autoimmune diseases who are battling cancer?  It’s important to paint the picture of the various combinations of genetics and illnesses and how it is impossible for them to know that this vaccine is safe.I ask people if they have talked to their primary care doctor about their risk from COVID given their age/health status.  If they are 30 and healthy, do you need to inject something that is this newly developed?Depending on the situation, I talk about the concern with government and businesses mandating something like this.  We are absolutely prohibited from forcing patients to take any medicine or undergo a surgery even when we know they would benefit from it.  We are required to get their consent for everything. Even after consent is given patients can still get up and walk away.  So what is different here?There are lots of infectious diseases out there.  Just think of the STDs out there.  Do we force people who have them to do anything that makes it impossible for them to spread that STD?  No.   We just advise the patient and the public at large on how to avoid infection.  That’s it.  So what is different here?The reliance on conspiracy theories will destroy support for the many legitimate reasons we have for fighting against any sort of mandate or any pressure to take this vaccine.

        In rural Canada, there are alot of pissed off-looking white guys. And they just seem different now… very quiet, determined, and ready (but we don’t know for what). A different attitude than the ignorant sportspuck redneck one that was so common before.

How much resistance will happen? I’d imagine our 3rd world doctors could be easy to bribe. And some churches will try to resist the mandatory vax. Anyways, it seems like Alex Jones and co. (Or maybe the book of Revelation) were right all along.

        It won’t happen, of course, but it would be hilarious if Obama, Bush and Clinton did take an actual vaccine on national television and fell to the floor, wreathing in agony before they were taken to a Bethesda care facility for the remainder of their worthless lives.On a more serious note, if the vaccine kills or maims people, expect targeted assassinations to become wildly popular. They probably would be anyhow, but this would increase the appetite for them. Non-astroturfed riots and violence will ensue immediately if this vaccine proves fatal or harmful. Let’s hope the “right” areas of cities burn if this happens.One factor you didn’t really address, Z, is nothing better illustrates a low trust society than having to coerce and terrorize citizens to take a vaccination against the Ooga-Booga Flu. A purported nation this drenched in cynicism and hate isn’t long for it.

            Adverse effects of the vac will be treated like election fraud. The media and the bureaucracy will stamp it out as conspiracy.While pharma has long had immunity from damages, the gubmint will on occasion compensate someone or their family. This practice may have to increase. Whats a few more prints? I can also see how it would dovetail nicely with UBI just as medicaid or SSI “disability” does.What will be a interesting to watch – and perhaps provide an opportunity for our side to stoke division and disruption, is the “intersectionality” of the wuhan pox and poc victim narratives.Their reliance on the old poc victimhood is just another coercive crutch that reveals the weakness of their ideas. How it infects covid narratives is no exception.Systemic raciss means covid impacts pocs disproportionately. So pocs should be first in line for vac.Problem is pocs are already deeply suspicious of white mans magic and are superstitious in general when it comes to miasmas like racism or wuhan.Plus they aren’t exactly big on self-care beyond hair. There will likely have to be gibs attached.Personally I am more than happy to give my dose to a guy like Juicy Smollet who deserves it because black n gay.But maybe there are a lot of rumors floating around about how it is causing erectile dysfunction of muh dik and dehydrated eggs. The white man is trying to control blaq bodies!Alas, it would only likely drove up the cost of compensating them, but it would be amusing. Which is something.

                All I can say is thank God this is disproportionally killing men. According to some statistics (yeah, I know) you could almost call this a man’s disease. Nobody really cares. Were it killing even a slightly higher percentage of women than men we would never hear the end of it. There would be endless girl-power, save the girls, strong girl survivor… signs, drives, commercials, billboards, etc. We already get enough Lookee-Me-Me-Me women shit in this society to gag an elephant.

Their staffs/visitors are screened, they don’t go out in public with the great unwashed, and they get top notch medical care at Bethesda with Drs who’s names end in “-stein”.

                    Because the actual transmission of a sufficient load of virii to infect someone is hard to do, and it helps if the intended victim is an “at-risk person”.The September Florida Co-vid deaths (149 for the whole state) had a median age of 83. That is, as many older than that as younger.A recent N.J. study of two hospitals with high Co-vid death rates showed that of those who died, over 80% had Do Not Resuscitate orders in place. That is, they already knew that they were dying BEFORE they got the Wu-flu.John in Indy

        Heh. Covid again.We had an electrician come in to do our PAT testing, and I was speaking to him about this. He seemed to agree that it was all an overreaction but then fell back on the old crux of ‘well, it _is_ real, I have a friend who knows someone who died of it.’ I countered with the epic suspension of freedoms we use to have (remember when you could get together with all family members at Christmas?)… his response was ‘tell that to someone who can’t breath.’.I would never dream of crushing other peoples freedoms or even bothering them if I was ill, aside from the doctor’s appointments. I cannot fathom the mind of someone who thinks that this whole lockdown business has been worth it.He then told me to watch something about a 1918 flu epidemic (pandemic?) on Youtube… he said that a quarter of the population of the world died during this. At this point I considered everything he said suspect, and he wasn’t a bad chap. But I could see that he still held onto the ‘if it saves just one life’ mentality.Great. Got that of my chest.

            I think you and I know the same electrician. He came onto my property about six months ago to do a job OUTSIDE…and wore a mask. I told him he didn’t have to wear a mask for me and that I preferred he not wear a mask on my property. We’ve known each other for a decade, yet he insisted on wearing it. We parted company on less than good terms and I don’t plan on hiring him again.

            Count me in as a vaccine skeptic.Mass governor CharlieParkererr… Baker, in his presser closing the state back down yesterday told a story about two couples who were supposed to be meeting at a restaurant for dinner, but the outdoor seating was full. One couple, Charlie’s pals, made the decision not to go inside, leading to an acrimonious parting. Well, the couple who went inside…wait for it… tested positive for COVID! I don’t know if he opened up for questions, but mine would have been- “Are these people actually sick?” And “could we have the contact info for these people”? Dollars to donuts he made the story up. What a buffoon.Cuomo, Whitmer, Walz, Baker, Mills, Newsome, etc… all would have trouble running a fast food joint (not all that easy- I did it once upon a time)Notice, too, Anders Tegnell is coming under scrutiny, the lynch mob being led by Swedish academia and the Swedish press, which makes ours look like a gang of neo- nazis.

                Heh. The wife used to work in a fast food joint. She loved it. Hard work but good camaraderie.The thing with the vaccine is: don’t force me. I don’t like being forced to do things for threats that are invisible to me. I’ll take my chances. Problem is, as we all know, when the democracy is voted for and staffed by children we get dragged along in the current.This is why focusing on a simpler, less consumer driven life and adopting the mental mindset of scarcity is so important. It is the first step and can save you from immense depression when things ‘normies’ take for granted require you to jump through multiple vaccine shaped hoops just to get the subscription for.

        I met up with college and old friends over the weekend; both engineers. Both were very excited about a vaccine rolling out. I asked if they found it odd that a vaccine, something that usually takes years to work out all the kinks and make sure side effects aren’t worse than what you’re trying to cure, went from concept to deployed in under a year. Would he sign off on a bridge design that normally would take several years of construction but was built in six months? Would the other trust a database that had been allowed to skip the major tests? Both agreed they would not, and then both wanted to change the subject. People haven’t even gotten the vaccine yet and it’s already messing with their heads.

            That saying comes from this classic:





The Pig Trap




https://taxicabdepressions.com/?p=1193

The taxi driver’s passenger, an ‘executive security’ honcho:

“These people are playing with matches… I don’t think they understand the scope and scale of the wildfire they are flirting with. They are fucking around with a civil war that could last a decade and cause millions of deaths… and the sad truth is that 95% of the problems we have in this country could be solved tomorrow,bynoon… simply by dragging 100 people out in the street and shooting them in the fucking head.”

        You do not have to pass a law to make something illegal. I am glad that you nicely articulate my views – that the vaccine will be mandatory to do anything. There will be no law (probably), just soft tyranny.For those who are concerned about the technical side of the vaccine, those will never be addressed by media. As you articulate, certainly they will parade kooks to discredit any reasonable objection (in the same way Flat Earthers are used to discredit anyone who believes in elite collusion). I am no expert, but I am beyond the average prole in knowledge of genetics and theory of mRNA. The issue I am most concerned with is 1)We actually have no idea how the human body really works. We can describe processes, but our bodies are so incredibly complex, the law of unintended consequences is no doubt coming into play when considering the amount of interplay between every element of our body. People think it is as simple as “we inject messenger RNA, it is synthesized into proteins.” If you think our body is that simple, please say “mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell” and consider yourself a cellular biologist. 2) Autoimmune diseases are extremely likely to spike as a result. 3)Inductive reasoning will finally be killed. In the same way childhood illnesses continue to grow as mass vaccines increase, the defense is that there has never been a study proving it. Well that is because the study has not been objectively done. But anyone who doesn’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blow can say that such a strong correlation (and there is) does hint at a causative relation. Any observations of a spike in autoimmune disorders, that many will see tangibly (unlike the disease itself) correlate with the vaccine, will be shut down with studies funded to ‘prove’ the opposite. Anyone using inductive reasoning will be hit with the ‘science-denier’ appellation.

            Also, the nanolipids that are used to protect the mRNA as injected are not being studied at all for safety. If I am not mistake, they are trademarked secrets that we cattle are not even allowed to know about. This reminds me of the Roundup issue. It wasn’t so much the glyphosate that was dangerous; it was equally the solvent that allowed the chemical to penetrate the waxy layer around the leaf. But since the solvents were listed as ‘inactive ingrediants’, no study of their safety was ever done, and glyphosate was approved by studying it in isolation, not the actual complete product.

                Reminds me of 5G.  A read a fairly reasoned piece where the author said that it might be possible that 5G radiation is bad for the eyes, basically baking the delicate tissue there since it is not nearly as robust a barrier as skin.  I went looking and could find…nothing, no one even bothered to check.  I suppose when people start getting eye surgeries 10 years earlier it will be just “one of those things” or they’ll blame it on the hole in the ozone.

The Theranos idea is interesting and I wouldn’t be surprised if it becomes reality at some point in the next few decades, but that entire debacle illustrates just how gullible the elites are that run our country/world.  There’s surely a lesson for dissidents in there, a blueprint for the Trojan Horse that gets us behind the levers of power.

            Anyone who states even factual objections will be labeled a “kook.” It really shouldn’t be a factor in one’s decisions. Increasingly it appears both Beijing and their puppets in D.C. introduced this virus intentionally into the United States. Of course, such speculation is “kooky” until it isn’t, then it becomes “dangerous.” About the latter, they are correct.

                Not even enforcement, just free market. The hammer and anvil of public-private joint-venture control over “the market” assures that the prole consumer buys product, buys license to buy different product, or pays tax to defer buying of product until later. Free market has many choices for consumer.“Private” health insurance providers will simply price-in the not-mandatory vaccine. Gubmint subsidizes cost of vax to bake in profit to them and they pass that on to us in the form of “free” covered vax. Gubmint backstops vax badness for both pharma and insurance.Meanwhile if you don’t vax, congratulations your premium is 2X plus wuhan plague might not be fully covered by your policy please see exemption rider. If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor of you take vax.Gubmint PR money flows into private media to shame and scare the consumers to do the right thing. Everybody gets paid. Lotsa fiat moves around. Consumer gets to “choose”. Freedom intact.

        It is funny that the places where I see the most rebellion against masks are places heavy in farmers and ag workers — the livestock auction, the feed store, etc. And it includes a really high percentage of older farmers who are in higher-risk categories.

I suspect there be a fair number of vaccine rebels in that group, too.

                Less topical, but also ask the farmers about monoculture. If we’re going to become Kalergi’s mud blob to end racism, that- monoversity- violates Mother Nature’s iron law.

In a monoculture wheat field, one blight, plague, or rust will kill the entire field.

            I’m one of those older farmer types and I can tell you that my cohort doesn’t buy the BS.  Probably because we’ve had lifelong harassment from the EPA and other agencies.  And the agencies just show up, drive onto your property without permission, investigate whatever and put you through hell with fines.  Since the Obama years, the agencies are diversity staffed–full of the clueless, radical and resentful.

                    Not far from the mark.  Way back when, I worked in a factory on the production line.  We were told that OSHA was coming by for inspection.  We were cleaning up the various “messes” that would get us crosswise with the Fed’s, when the production manager told me to leave what I was straightening out alone.  I later found out that there were several instances of such minor “violations” than were *always* left for OSHA to “find”.  This was because OSHA always dug deeper and deeper to find something to cite in any inspection.  Give them a few minor violations and they can show they’ve done their job and would go away quickly.

                        I like your production manager’s thinking. We can use that sort of thing going forward in Our cause.  Hide in plain sight. Bait and switch. Diversion. I’ve been studying up on British deception operations in the world wars as a lark. Such a clever bunch. It’s hard, as a man that tries to be truthful, to think like that. Alas, we may have to become adepts.

                        When I worked in a butcher shop, the idea was to leave a couple of obvious but meaningless violations in plain sight.  The inspector would write them up, call it a day at that point, we would fix them, and everyone went their merry way.  They would dig until they found something, so give them something easy and meaningless to find.  Not posting all the required health/employment posters was an easy one.

                    Random?  They came out with an entirely new set of rules, the Food Safety Modernization Act, a few years ago that greatly enhanced their ability to shut down your place of work.  They no longer have to find evidence of product adulteration, they merely have to posit that you were producing under conditions thatmighthave led to adulteration, a completely subjective conclusion.

                    They’ll keep the ghettos for their pets but live in sprawling Hearst style estates. We kept thinking the Reconquisda would be driven by hordes of illegal Mexican peasants. Actually, it’ll be the return of the Old Spanish Californios noblemen… they’ll just have yid and Punjabi sounding names this time.

                    The rulings in California and NY serve one purpose. Drive the existing population into surrounding states so they act like a spreading infection.They are well aware that these people are the same twats that welcomed in all the reality denying BS and will promptly go and vote in the same people that caused them to leave in the first place because feelings.They are nothing but locus of infections in the same way universities are.Cuomo and the others don’t give a shit if the city become a smoking ruin. It will spread the poz plague and that is all that counts.

            Definitely. The cloud people despise the fact that all of the cool, interesting places on earth are easily accessible to middle class travelers.That’s all going to come to an end.Can everyone here believe that just a year ago we were all significantly freer than we are now, and most of the population is simply going along with it?I knew most people were sheep, but only when it’s in your face every day is one overwhelmed by the realization that our society is built on sand and the high tide is rolling in fast.And why the rush by our elites to get their dystopia started? The cloud people seem obsessed with rolling all of this out as quickly as possible, despite the fact that there are more holes and glaring contradictions in their programs than one can count.It really is like watching a bad movie.

                “The cloud people despise the fact that all of the cool, interesting places on earth are easily accessible to middle class travelers.”Meh. My wanderlust experiences have shown that Normies either don’t go outside at all or go to the AAA-rated places in order to take selfies. Neither they nor Elites want to JOURNEY. This in 2019, not just 2020.I’ve also been to those Aspen mansions of the Cloud People. Nobody lives in them. They’re just investment properties.The Cloud People want to possess all the good things of life but they are unable to enjoy them. I was happier hunting for crawdads in the roadside crick of my youth than they are flying hot tubs into Davos to plot world conquest. They think restricting travel is a way to steal happiness, a concept they don’t quite understand yet hate because we have it and they don’t.

                    Most people don’t like walking more than a half a mile from their car. Any tourist hotspot has a big clump of people near the cars or bus/train station.Walk for more than 10 minutes and you’re free of the madding crowd.

        We’re already in the early stages of a covidian dystopian nightmare – people are going bonkers and will gladly clamor for the jab while obediently continuing to wear their face rags.  It’ll be solidified pretty much forever if we don’t deviate from this highway to hell.  God help us.

                The ‘dream’ of1984was that the totalitarians had finally found the “secret sauce” to perpetuate their oppressive system indefinitely, which is unrealistic, fortunately.  Part of the reason we’re even in this mess is that even an oppressive place like China cannot get their people to stop eating bush-meat or use semi-modern animal husbandry techniques.

                    “Part of the reason”…  The other part is that the Wuflu virus just might have been weaponized with “never happen in nature” aids-like grafts into the virus, which is what some Indian researchers claimed early on, before they were shut down and non-personed.  These days, given all the controls over the permitted narrative, I am not ruling it out.

        The Daily Mail had a article a few days ago about how the Pfizer CEO isn’t even sure it prevents transmission of the virus. Yet they are positive about the effectiveness of the vaccine against adverse affects of the virus. I asked my libtard brother how it was possible that a vaccine could have one property without the other- it would make it the first vaccine in human history to prevent death but allow transmission. He had a bizarre theory about it being a mrna vaccine, but I think occum’s razor suggests the opposite. The simplest explanation is it just doesn’t work at all.But following on the CEO’s comments, it sounds like not only you are going to mandatorily get this vaccine, but it’s not going to stop the covid lockdown public policy as it doesn’t actually prevent transmission. The best of all possible worlds for our ruling class, isn’t it?

            It is possible to still carry and therefore transmit a virus after being vaccinated for it. For example, the seasonal flu shot is about 40-60% effective. You get the shot, but your immune system does not respond or does not create the memory cells that produce the antigen.The evidence to date says the mRNA vaccine does not last very long. They are talking about people needing booster shots every six months. If the vaccine is not 95% effective, which almost a guarantee, then we will have half the vaccinated not actually immunized and some percentage of the formerly immunized losing their immunity.

                I had Coronavirus back in March/April; I had virtually no symptoms  .. I felt like I was coming down with a cold for about six hours one day, then it subsided.  My wife had a moderate fever for ten days, stepson had mild/moderate pneumomia on and off for a few months.  Neither was hospitalized.  Both tested positive via nasal swab (in April). Both had weird sense of taste &amp; smell (still do, nine months later). I’ve had nasal swabs and blood tests since early August (couldn’t get unrelated medical care without being tested), nasal swabs always negative, blood antibody tests ~4.5 on a scale of 1.5 – 8.0 (below 1.5  = no antibodies, 8.00 seems to be max amount).  In other words– no symptoms &amp;recovered &amp; immune &amp; not contagious.  I never wore the mask, I’m out &amp; about every day all year, not worried about the disease, only concerned about the zombies in Brooklyn, 95% who wear masks; occasionally they yell at me, kick me off the bus, or out of the store. &lt;shrugs&gt;.Oh well, life during wartime.

                            Won’t.  Can’t.  Big pharma generally immune to lawsuits stemming from vaccines.
Pharma gets the profits when they develop/sell it; taxpayers fund the payouts when they F up.  Isn’t it fun to write the laws?
Normal vaccines are covered by Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.  (NVICP).  Payouts courtesy of the US Taxpayer.
Covid Vaccines covered by similar program: Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) – much the same; taxpayer funded, big pharma immune.

                            A class action lawsuit.
This touching belief in the law, this pure and simple faith in rules.
How sweet.
This will no doubt happen after SCOTUS demands and rules a recount in the swing states.
A case SCOTUS will refuse to hear on procedural grounds, with no dissent, 9-0.

                        We don’t even know what the true mortality rate is – it’s all been corrupted by the fact that hospitals are getting paid to check off Covid-19 on the reason for death.
Even the mainstream news though can’t get around telling some tidbits of truth that should really make you question what is going on.  For instance – I have noticed multiple newscasts over the last few weeks where the ” Average age of Covid deaths is 81″ is quickly scrolled by on the lower panel.
You don’t really seem them expounding on that little fact very much though.

                                I think it’s something like 78.4 – it is different for men and women.  Point is – the AVERAGE age of death – is 81.  You can also go look at the population distribution by age – and the numbers are very heavily weighted towards younger people.  So …. when you factor that in as well to how that 81 years old average could have been calculated – it shows pretty clearly that there is very little risk amongst the younger age groups.If you also factor in that many of those deaths attributed to Cornholeya virus were likely because of other causes – they just checked the box for the virus to get a payment – it REALLY REALLY starts to make the whole thing look bogus.But as Zman pointed out – people are just going to start screaming because of the propoganda beaten into their head by the MSM.  I don’t see any way of fighting this – except at a personal level – which means directly with the people you have the most contact with.

                        Another piece of the puzzle to consider – is that I have seen evaluations done of the overall death rate – and what they found is that the expected overall death rate – has not budged.  In other words – there doesn’t appear to be any “extra” deaths out there – because of Cornholeya virus.I should probably save this stuff when I run across it – so I can bolster my points.  But honestly trying to keep ahead of all the bullshit just gets tiring at times.  I run across the articles – read them to see if I’m missing something in my skepticism of what is going on – and move on.

                    A good friend of mine who was in her 50s and healthy caught the disease in March and was sick for six months. She needed to go to the emergency room several times (although she never had to be hospitalized overnight), and still isn’t back to 100%. This isn’t most people’s experience, but it isn’t that rare either. So the disease deserves respect.

                                Well, let’s turn your question around, shall we?An acquaintance of mine committed suicide last July. He closed up all the garage doors, started his car, and asphyxiated himself. Death certificate read: COVID-19.The local jail had close to 100 ‘cases’ over the last 9 months. Why, they did super official, brain swabbing ‘tests’ and everything! They quarantined these cons in their own wing. Not a single one was seriously ill, just the usual cough and sniffles you would expect from head colds and the flu. No high fevers, no shortness of breath, no loss of taste and smell. Not a single one! No one died, all recovered after a regimen of zinc and vitamins.(The kind of thing you might prescribe for, oh, I don’t know…head colds and the flu?)The local hospital has an entire wing dedicated to the Brainwash Virus. Last time I was on the floor (three weeks ago, that was) they had a grand total of 2 patients. No deaths.So, who should I believe? Some Internet rando who cannot figure out it’s a scam by simple observation and evaluating the hysterical lies that surround this psy op? Or my own lyin’ eyes and the ability to think for myself?Spoiler alert: I’m going with my own lyin’ eyes and the fact that every person who believes this Covid stupidity still shops at Wal Mart and eats at Jack In The Box in the midst of the ‘deadly pandemic’.EDIT : I wore the same cloth mask for 6 months when I was working at the jail. I worked nights and therefore ignored the ridiculous PPE requirements while giving direct care to these inmates in the Turr’ble Turr’ble Covid Wing. People who the tests claimed were 100%, unquestionably INFECTED.I washed that mask once, sometime back in July. Handwashed it at my kitchen sink with a little Tide because it was getting a little gunky. That mask is still on my kitchen counter; I take it along whenever I’m headed into enemy territory and I know wearing one will be Commie-forced upon me.And I am not sick. Never felt better! The virulent deadliness of Covid 19 is a total fraud for pussies and the easily controlled.

                        Anybody who is concerned that this disease is not being taken seriously – should squarely point the finger of blame at the authorities and ALL of those people who are trying to ride on the back of this virus – to shove their own agendas down people’s throats.The amount of lying going on is truly spectacular.  And I spend much more time on this than most people do – reading articles – trying to figure out what is REALLY going on…. etc.Given the potential massive downside to believing the crap coming out of the elites in charge – I think it’s entirely prudent to just adopt the attitude of “this is all bullshit – the virus is nowhere near as bad as they are claiming it is” – and then move on with your life.That sort of thing translates directly into people saying things like ” the virus is not even real” and ” the vaccine is there to make you sterile” – along with all of the other stuff people ignore as tinfoil.If there wasn’t so much goddamned lying and so much of what is going on that just seems to be a power play to gain ultimate control – we might be able have an actual sensible conversation about what best to do.  But when you’re driving everybody out of business and out of their jobs and they’re losing everything – it’s not unexpected that they would start getting a little bit unreasonable in response to hearing excuses.

                    I find it very interesting that you say your wife and stepson both had a weird sense of taste &amp; smell .I have a toddler in daycare – and last year I think I came down with pretty every single illness known to man because of that exposure. It’s something the pediatrician warned us about,  but it was just sort of brutal being sick all … of …. the …. time.One of the last things I caught was some sort of weird cold or flu around mid-November 2019.  The thing was – this was obviously some sort of respiratory illness as I was coughing up crap from my lungs for probably 3 weeks – but the thing that really got me was that I had a very strange taste/smell in my body for that period of time.  I’ve told this to other people – and they also said they had something “weird” around that time – and they also had the strange taste/smell sensation.I can’t even put a finger on how to relate what it felt like – I want to say “metallic” but that isn’t it.  I’ve actually tasted metal – and this wasn’t that.When I tell people I had this weird shit in November – they totally dismiss it as “must have been something else”.I noticed though that the CDC rolled back their estimate to when Cornholeya virus showed up to December of 2019.  So they’re closing in on when I think I got it.

                    Dec 2: President-elect Biden “This virus will kill 250,000 by January. Because people won’t listen” (paraphrasing, but very close)
That’s one more than Vietnam’s worth of deaths every week for 4 weeks.
Clearly not happening yet…where are the mass graves?  Where are the ecstatic adulations of Biden successfully getting us to “listen” and drop the projected deaths?
Something doesn’t add up here.  250k over and above other total US normal death rates is an 11% spike. It would be totally obvious…everyone who be losing a loved one or family member.

Who said it’s “over and above”?  It’s a matter of difference of which box gets ticked.The WHO changed the rules back in March. A death certificate (a document that’s been standardized globally, it seems) has two sections. Section one lists the events and actual cause. If Section 2 of the death certificate includes covid, covid killed them according to the new WHO fatwa.
These instructions on how to fill it out in the UK explain the difference .https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/877302/guidance-for-doctors-completing-medical-certificates-of-cause-of-death-covid-19.pdf

Total death numbers in the US lag about 2-3 years.  We won’t truly know how much the deaths “spiked” until at least 2023.  If ever.

                This mRNA technique is experimental and hasn’t been used on humans before. Virus vaccination is usually an injection with a dead or weakened virus, mRNA “vaccine” is injection with some crap they whipped up in the lab, in this case they did it in a huge hurry – 8 months development and testing rather than the usual 10 years for a much simpler “dead virus ” type of jab.https://www.stopthevaccine.com/pg2.htm– look for the summary at bottom of that page.Vaccines are great, but I don’t want this one till everyone in government has tried it for a couple years minimum.

                What whitney said.  If they’re vaccinated, they should be immune and unafraid, right?
But then, I saw the billboard in Albuquerque- some AWFL saying “I wear the mask to protect my little brother with asthma.”
You just don’tCAREenough, do you?

            I think we will be lucky if the vaccine does nothing.

What’s more likely, is that the vaccine causes sterilization, or death, or cancer, or something. Perhaps only for certain races. It would likely build up slowly over time, every “booster shot” builds up to eventual infertility.

Or perhaps a 5G microchip. I would not recommend taking this shot if at all possible.

                    That’s my suspicion: BigPharma has this, thus far, unused vaccine tech that they’ve wasted buckets of money researching and they finally have an opportunity to cash in on it.  The fact that every authority of any sort is just a sock puppet for them makes it easy to pull off.

                    There are all kinds of “conspiracy theories”. TPTB will always promote (secretly) the dopiest, so as to discredit them all. For example, Oliver Stone was conned by Fletcher Prouty into incorporating the silliest JFK theory — Jim Garrison’s “rogue homos from the CIA who all lived on one block in New Orleans” — so as to discredit all the others.
It’s always amusing when self-appointed “gatekeepers” ban “conspiracy theories” so that we don’t seem like nuts; yet a majority of Americans endorse skepticism about JFK and 9/11. Whose optics are they concerned with?

            The best-case scenario is that it simply doesn’t work. I, for one, don’t understand how the mRNA molecules are supposed to find their way to the ribosomes after entering the cell, or how they resulting spike proteins are then to make their way out of the cell and into the bloodstream. My guess is that the mRNA portion will have the same effect saline solution. The more worrisome aspect will be the “adjuvants” and other nonsense they might be adding to stimulate the immune system.

        “If you think you can just blow this off, think again.”
But damn it – that’s my goal.  At some point we all need to choose a threshold – a Rubicon – that we’re committed to holding.  Another Rubicon (coming shortly) will be the move for gun registration.  Don’t register your gun?  No problem, you can’t have a driver’s license.  It’s coming.  For those who aren’t anti-fragile, now might be a good time to work on it.

                I think this is more a happy side effect than the intent.The economy is in freefall and Keynesian theory needs money to have velocity.Its basically static  now and there are no policies that can be implimented that will work to get growth.Its classic Marxist Late Stage Capitalism which is kind of like a monopoly game where one guy owns almost everything. The economy won’t work.As for paying for UBI, it will have to be money printing as there is no tax scheme that can raise enough and any attempt to get more revenue will  result in layoffs galore.This will create some inflation or so its hoped but if will, who knows,. Mostly it creates more misery.

            I would argue that the Draconian implementation of the Covidian Rules should be the Rubicon Event, as you suggest. And that should be the trigger for fighting fire with fire. Wouldn’t it be awful if warehouses caught fire and burned down, or transport trailers disappeared overnight, or manufacturing facilities suffered egregious maintenance failures? Incrementalism can work both ways. Near the end of WWII, nearly all German tanks were breaking down regularly because the slave labor building them did very poor work indeed. A careless smoker can be your best friend in the new war against tyranny.

                    You beat a tyranny with a cellular insurgency. As an example, imagine the lone janitor on night shift who everyone thinks is slightly retarded and totally ignores.

They get invited in, guards have no idea what these guys are doing, and they can time delay any outcome into months after they have left town. Think outside the box. Sometimes being an innocuous peon is the greatest power of all.

        I heard a co-worker yesterday declare that he hopes our employer makes the vaccine mandatory. But then we are in Canada, the country founded by the English who ran from freedom, and the French, so it’s not unexpected. Depressing, but no longer surprising.
I thought I was deeply cynical about the sheople in 2019, but this year has shown you can never be cynical enough about how many people will enthusiastically embrace their own slavery.

        Everyone should plan on permeating the airwaves with non-stop fear porn of people getting hurt by the vaccine, no matter how implausible the vaccine actually hurt them. Relentlessly saturate social media, tell all your real-life friends, pepper the conversation in the checkout lines. Make it so rampant it drowns out the deboonkers. Make them forcefully silence people and then treat them like martyrs.This is not the time for facts and reason, or even about being right. It’s the time for scaring the normies about the vaccine just as much as the media has over covid.

        This is what they are going to try to do with guns as well. There will almost certainly not be any kind of attempted national confiscation that would set off a civil war, at least not for another couple of decades. What will happen is that there will be a huge effort to make gun ownership difficult, expensive, and stigmatized, the Tobacco strategy” if you will. Of course, the NRA still exists, and can be counted on to fight this every step of the way – no such organization exists with regard to Covid – yet.

                I think you are both right. One, make gun insurance a requirement, and make it prohibitively expensive. Two, make it illegal (in practice) to use it. Just see those who tried to defend themselves again Antifa types. I care not what the law says, I care about the Soros funded DA that prosecutes.

                Yes, in most places in Red states you are still pretty much OK using a firearm in self-defense, but make sure that you stay out of the blue cities (stay out of those anyway, for oh so many reasons). Look at that poor bastard in Omaha, persecuted unto suicide for shooting a drug addict attacking him. It doesn’t get much redder than Nebraska, but Omaha has lots of blacks, and lots of democrats, so…That’s why the guy who calls himself “Anti-Dem” is right; who your local sheriff and Chief of Police are is a lot more important than who is president, they decide how the law gets enforced. Local elections are the most important.

                If said intruder is non-White, that’s already the ‘law.’  In the UK people are not allowed to be unkind to the gypsies (the real ones, brown people descended from Indians who are illegal immigrants) that squat in their houses and change the locks.  Said gypsies also like killing the ducks, geese, and swans in English parks and cooking them.Noggers are increasingly doing the same (squatting in houses, changing the locks and getting papers to prove they’re the new legal owners) and the force of the fedgov will soon be behind them because middle-class home ownership be rayciss.

                As long as they can keep raising money for doing it, sure they will. Look, I have no illusions about the NRA and their motives, but it’s a simple fact that the freedom to own and defend yourself with a gun is one of the very few freedoms that has actually been expanded in the last fifty years, and the NRA has had a lot to do with that, and that in the face of snobby ConInc types looking down their noses at them. If conservatives had had any brains (which they don’t of course) they would have tried to copy the NRA’s success. Fat chance…

                The NRA’s job is to promote gun rights, which they have done well, in fact gun ownership is the only area where the “right” won some of the culture war.

                I’m not sure if gun people will fight either  but the election isn’t resolved nor is any possible backlash to the theft,It  might surprise you that a lot of people including right wing gun types care nothing about school prayer or abortion.I’m in that list. Many of us are not much  more religious than our Blue counterparts or at most aren’t  going to church . Nor do we  think that the State needs to promote prayer.Some of us, me included are fine with abortion even if they don’t much like it  and while its not polite to admit, I think voluntary eugenic abortion is far more good than evil. No more Down’s Syndrome is a very good thing.Also there were a lot of places where abortion clinics were rendered no longer viable. It got to be a big enough issue that Clinton used the FBI to break up groups.They won that fight as much as could be won given the nature of the issue . Abortion itself  is at an all time low and mostly in Blue cities. The morning after pill and the social changes took care of much of the rest.Heck we even won Teen Pregnancy. Its lower on an absolute basis than in 1940 when we started tracking it despite at least a doubling of the population.And we didn’t do this  by moral prating, hiding knowledge, We did it with comprehensive sex ed and Teen Mom.

            They don’t have to do anything but continue with existing strategies.  It’s already monumentally expensive to train a good rifleman … a few thousand rounds down range equates to several thousand dollars.  If you shop for critical reloading components you’ll find that powder/primer/brass is hard to come by – critically so.  I can’t afford to smoke $5 packs of cigarettes, nor can I afford a couple hundred bucks for an afternoon of 5.56 plinking.  TPTB minimize possibilities of open conflict if most people have only one or two magazines of ammo for their $2K tacti-cool rifle.

                The ammo supply problem is probably the same asshole hoarders that are making  TP unavailable around here again.You may want 2k rounds for training but there is only so much material and manufacturing  capacity  to go around.   From what I can tell nearly all the plans are at full capacity and no one has reported suspicious buyers grabbing   up the supply. Just new buyers and panic buyers on an stretched supply chain.Ammo is out there even at places like cheaper than dirt, just a bit pricey compared to usual.I doubt this won’t be a rifleman’s war anyway. Its mostly going to be close and dirty work and frankly a pair of pliers will be far more useful than an AR  far often  than not.Don’t get me wrong, if you can get a rifle in some off caliber or any caliber  which still has plenty ammo out there and get good with it, all the better but there are loads of options, legal and otherwise to resist if it comes to that.Don’t despair.

        That paper card they will be issuing will be replaced with an app for your phone that will be required if you want to function like what passes as a normal adult.
This already exists with auto insurance. Allstate gives a discount if you install an app that tracks your location and speed. If you disable it, you get email reminders to turn it back on. The coming government app compliance will be more intrusive than a discount and an email.

                    Problem is—or will be—when the “voluntary” users of such tracking reach a critical point and then such tracking becomes mandatory for the issuance of the policy.Case in point.  I don’t use a cell phone.  It is cased (Faraday cage) and mostly turned off.  I’ll break it out for emergency travel and such, but not for steady use.  However, I am now finding any number of software services used, like logging into brokerage accounts, that require two stage authentication.  Fine, good idea—however the second stage (after pw) is an authorization code *only* sent through a cell phone text message.  The assumption being that cell phone usage is now universal.

                So long as you get a discount nobody cares. True Consoomers are legion now who care nothing about personal privacy whatsoever. Anyone who spends half their life starting into a screen and/or taking pics of themselves cares nothing about having their lives tracked in a Truman Show like fashion.I learned this by observing how many of my own friends, acquaintances, and family have voluntarily installed a ‘Telescreen’ into their home. Echo Dots and Alexa. Theyall have themand not only that, they paid for the privilege!Amazon assures us that it is only recording when you say ‘Alexa’ and believe me, you cantrust Amazon implicitly.So you just installed a recording device with unlimited cloud storage that records your every spoken word in perpetuity, I’m sure that will never come back to haunt you.They are all in on the “if you have nothing to hide the who cares” bandwagon. Compliant, pliant, ignorant, consumer sheep. They’ve nearly achieved their goal. We here, the people that remember a different world that wasn’t even really that long ago are a fraction of a fraction at this point. Enjoy your panopticon open-air prison and servitude plebe.

The other day I went round to tell the Pajeet neighbours to keep the noise down on the TV. Pajeet says he doesn’t have a TV. He then says, ah, it must have been Alexa. Great…
You’re spot on when you point out (alarmingly) just how many of our number, young and old, go all in for full blown consumerism. Consequences be damned.

        If one wants a primer on what is to come we have copious amounts of movies and books describing our dystopian future. There are usually a few general themes that run through most of them, none that would surprise anyone here. Even Black Mirror episodes are especially good on this, seeing that the types that hate us and freedom are similar to these monsters.

            That’s what a lot of us were asking back in the 80’s. Of course, if Covid were a disease that somehow had a connection to gays,or blacks, or any other “victim” group,we would be told that are chance of dying from it were miniscule, and to quit worrying. This is the tack the Left was taking back in January and February, back when the disease was associated with Asians and Communism, and before they realized the opportunities this :crisis” offered for a power grab.

        Even if everything about the vaccine was totally above board and honest,and it totally worked, with no side effects, I still can see no logical reason why anyone under the age of fifty who had no serious illnesses should get it. The fact that it is seemingly going to be mandatory for everyone is highly suspicious, at the very least.

            I mean, it is only reasonable that everyone chip in and have 330 million people pay $250 each for the vaccine, than to make Boomers pay $750 each for 110 million shots… The boomers will literally sell their progeny off via accidental infertility to “spread the wealth around” while simultaneously decrying “muh socializms” – just you wait, it’s coming.  Not that the boomers here will, mind you, but the group will.“The Boomers will cry out about socialism while nationalizing your healthcare savings account.”

                “Fascism” is notoriously difficult to define.
My best definition is that the government is specifically set up to serve the historic population.
Fascism is not perfect. It suffers from the problem of being subverted, but every government is vulnerable to that, even small government federalism, as the history of the USA demonstrates.

                    But in the US we have a new, Leftist form of fascism, whose purpose is to serve the minority population–blacks in particular–and to subjugate the historic population. Having said that, the 1619 Project is arguably an attempt to make blacks the historic population.

            I know Z and many here like to beat up on the libertarians but I have to say that at least some of their ideas are becoming more relevant by the day.  I’d say there is an aching need, in the US and around the world, for a movement of people who value personal autonomy, freedom of speech and religion, free assembly, free association, and freedom of conscience.The problem is that the libertarians’ obsessive focus on government as the only threat to these things means they turn a blind eye to some of the most egregious things going on, for instance in Big Tech.  Here’s an articlehttps://www.wired.com/story/science-journals-are-purging-racist-sexist-work-finally/that extols the actions of science journals in denouncing and retracting papers that fail to tow the equalist line in everything.  Every day, you see something like this that shows the Western world is losing its mind and its soul.  The great spirit of adventure and truth seeking that has built the modern world and taken us to the edge of interstellar space is being replaced by a spirit that shrinks from uncomfortable truth and wears a cowardly mask of fear and submission with perverse pride.At some point we will need to find those who value and are willing to fight for freedom in real life.  We CAN free ourselves and our world from the freakish tyrants who have risen to power and the mobs of hysterical women and gutless men who enable them.  These are not people acting from inner strength and peace.  There is a kind of mass insanity stalking the world – perhaps great numbers of people are so socially atomized that they now crave every new imposition like junkies needing their next fix.We cannot guarantee that our organizations will be free of infiltrators but perhaps we can take heart in knowing that the ruling class at its core is a weak and self-loathing.  These are not strong people but very sick ones and the tyranny they have planned for us will not be some drab but orderly Brave New World or 1984.  It will be a never ending replay of 2020 with fresh chaos and madness around each turn.  We aren’t just fighting for freedom but for civilization itself.  We’re not up against Stalin here so much as Cthulhu.

                The biggest problem for  libertarianism is that it only appeals to a small number of Anglo men and no one else. Therefore, you can only impose libertarianism by violating the NAP, which is a delightful irony.
Only when we can found a country of independent, 110+ IQ Anglo men does libertarianism ever have a chance of being realized.

                    Well, yes, I’ve sometimes joked that most people would need to be frog marched into freedom at gun point.  I’m not calling on most people though.  What we desperately need is a core of strong and determined men to fight to restore our civilization as a whole.  I don’t think it needs to be explicitly WN but simply an unapologetic defense of “white values and civilization”.  The important thing is to raise a united front against the tide of infantile and abject dependency and credulity towards media and government.  We must start building or rather rebuilding the core of Western civilization around masculine virtues of individual autonomy and courage.I’m so tired of hearing from people in /our thing/ though that we can’t organize because anything we do will be infiltrated and subverted.  I just looked up how many agents there are in a certain federal alphabet soup gang.  It’s like 12,000.  If even 5 or 10% of white men joined an organization devoted to fighting ALL the nonsense on ALL fronts there would be no stopping it.  By this, I mean something like the NRA for “freedom issues”.  Local chapters would fight things like lockdowns, mask orders, vaccine mandates, and business closures.  The national organization would challenge governmentANDcorporate overreach in the courts and through typical mass movement methods like marches and rallies.  Enemy media could be targeted for pranks and harassment.  States and municipalities could be given “freedom scores” just like the NRA does for gun rights.  However this thing evolves, the important point is start it.Here in Oregon we can’t seem to do any organizing for anything because even supposedly right wing people are terrified of defying our insane governor’s edicts about gatherings and masks.  This is in spite of the fact that there’s basically no enforcement of this stuff.  These are people who routinely break the speed limit in their cars despite there being very real enforcement and penalties for that.  Honestly, I think the inability to properly assess and quantify risk has spread from the crazed Karen population to even a lot of our own people.

It’s bad enough that we all have to wear face diapers. It’s bad enough that TV and other media have been blackwashed and “critical race theory” is the only acceptable viewpoint. We’ve had an election stolen in glare of spotlights and still our media (the Pravda-like propaganda organs of the ruling class) gaslights us with “there is no fraud, nothing to see here.”We aren’t voting our way out of this, but I don’t know what the way forward is, absent divine intervention.

            I’ve already had this conversation with a liberals over masks.  It rings hollow to them.  The hypocrisy doesn’t even register.  Not even when they retort “not when another life is involved.”  And this is why conversations don’t matter.  Just raw power.  Political.  Social.  Monetary or otherwise.

        At some point, a critical mass of US citizens will come the realization that the unholy trinity of Fed/Wall Street/Tech Oligarchs has already become a soft tyranny and the hard version is just around the corner (think bubble bursting/economic collapse scenario). The sleepwalking will continue until a real boot is placed on everyone’s neck, but we need not remain idle in the run-up to full scale tyranny. Get busy now.

            Was just thinking about this leaked email.
I’ve wondered if this whole COVID-19 is a psy-op. Release some non deadly virus and people think it’s a joke. They release COVID-21 next year, and badthinkers think this one is weak too. Instead, it kills them all.
The fact that we think everything could be a conspiracy is not a good sign about the direction of our society, as Z said. But just like with -19, I will be cautious about -21 until inferences can be made.

        “There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always— do not forget this, Winston— always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless.If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever. ” – Orwell

            As Bram Stoker’s heroes moved ever eastwards to reach the castle of Soros, er, Dracula, it was “baksheesh”, “baksheesh”, “and more baksheesh” to get anywhere. Do anything.
Although fictional, I doubt the nature of man as chronicled, including the undead Count Soros, er, Dracula, has changed one iota. And just who stole the Widow Stoker’s intellectual property over a technicality, pray tell?

        They should call the COVID committee managing all of this the Committee of Public Safety.  What this amounts to is a country with a rent seeking economy.  They think they can grow the economy by expanding the rent seeking.  In reality, it’s the opposite.  The government can’t break a million windows and expect more economic activity because thousands of glass installers need to be hired.  The rent seeking never stops.  And they get off on the control.  They especially like sneaking off to private parties at restaurants while the plebes are masked up getting fast food.

        ”You cannot organize a proper resistance if you cannot organize at all.”Well that’s a hypothetical, no one wants to organize.  They just want it to end.It won’t end until all resistance including thought is ended, but more immediately until we have 50 state Uniparty.  I mean; 2020 is the new normal, and Nov 4th 0400 the new Gold Standard of elections.They will not and cannot, must not allow any opposition formally or informally in the GOP (🤣) State Houses.  That would be a serious mistake and lapse on their part.The elections of 2020 and universal mail in ballots is already and will be the norm until power is consolidated, this will go on for at least a decade.  Its 2020 every day until we’re all dead, or crushed.

        Over the next six months, the media will promote kooks insisting that the vaccine is a mind control devise or that it alters your DNA in order to make you docile and compliant. These paranoids will be promoted, because most people will dismiss them. This tarnishes all resistance to the new regime. It is a tool of managerial fascism that works every time.

        Consider the first 50 million Americans vaccinated as a phase IV trial.  Unless in one of the designated risk categories, you are not likely to be part of that trial.  I enjoy reading the racial disparity advocates splitting between “us first” and “not us.”  Perhaps the same people are saying both, trying to have their cake and eat it too.

        Does anyone remember back in the 70’s (and maybe later) when travelers in SE Asia had to carry a little yellow booklet with your vaccination history. The cholera vaccine had to be boosted every six months or so. If you arrived in Singapore or Jakarta (for example) with an expired vaccine, you were taken to a room and jabbed before entry was allowed..

            I have a Yellow Card.
The difference is that it is voluntary and not tracked in a centralized database.
Getting the Yellow Fever vaccination makes sense, because we know that is a terrible disease and we know the vax works.
Neither of those things are true for WuFlu.

            I remember such an incident.  Buddy and I were prepping to go down the South America.  We got all these shots at the public health center—except for one—smallpox.  We were told that according to WHO, smallpox was eradicated.  My buddy was no dope and fluent in Spanish and had access to publications.  We left and came back a few days later with newspaper articles about smallpox breakouts in a couple of regions.  Took a few days, but they got the inoculations in.  We were probably the last couple of Americans to get vaccinated in the US.  And no, it was the real thing, I still have the scab scar on my arm to prove it.

            Here’s the thing about medical trials: You can’t test anything on kids, pregnant/nursing women, etc. That’s probably much higher than 50%. Now you have to get into the weeds of medical research and double-blind studies. The participation protocol for studies often involves room-and-board for the duration or just a stipend for the locals. Neither way matches how most people live in their everyday circumstances.

            Ok, I will bite.My list includes the local slum lord that is getting rich off renting to illegals … while he is chum with the local mayor and police department … and code enforcement … that have looked the other way for years. Cars with out of state plates, and many of them on single family home driveways. Piles of mattresses dumped out front for the town to take away.
That’s one.

        […] In the case of the vaccine, there is no reason at all to trust the government. They have simply lied too often about too many aspects of this virus. Compounding it is their communications organs have been staffed by demented sociopaths who lie for the sheer pleasure of it. The only way anyone we could trust the media is if they are the first to be inoculated. Even then, it would probably be a fake vaccine, so we would need some way to ensure they are getting the real jab and not a fake. […]

        I am related to a young pulmonary doctor, and I know him well. He insists that the masks help and should definitely be worn. He’s also kind of a country boy and is skeptical of leftists. I’ll wear the mask in public buildings based on his assessment.

            This is a conversation I have frequently: theydowork: if someone is sick and they wear a good, clean mask that is changed out once every several hours (or after touching it) it will help keep them from making other people sick.  If you’re not sick it will do nothing (as, obviously, it won’t keep you from making other people sick because you’re not sick yourself, and the mask is not an effective filter against airborne viral particles if you’re around someone who is sick).  So in a very strict sense the masks do something, but as a practical matter they’re worse than useless.Now, I tell that to people, they nod and say that makes absolute sense, and then promptly forget what I just said.

                I’m less at risk for a cold now because all the non-White enrichers, who coughed, sneezed, and spat in public, are now staying home or going masked. Those of us who wash our hands and follow sanitary guidelines learned in the ’60s are generally healthy. Amazing, innit? And if someone has a comorbidity or asthma, too bad, so sad. Stay home and leave me alone. People die every day. Deal with it. It’s not “THE VIRUS,” it’s a virus, one of many. And I have zero f8(&amp;ks to give for my presumed ‘neighbors’ or ‘fellow ‘murricans.’

                I asked my doctor the same question and cited studies to the contrary, got no response.  It is probably simply an emotive response.  Physicians are by and large a lazy lot and protect themselves from law suit by robotically accepting “best practice” pronouncements from authority figures, like the CDC.If I get those responses—especially to why I must wear a mask (as opposed to voluntary, personal health concerns)—I usually respond with asking why they think they have the moral authority to demand I sacrifice myself for their benefit.  This usually ends the conversation as they have no depth in such understanding.  To this effect, I give thanks to Ayn Rand.  😉

                There are literally hundreds of mask efficacy studies available online. I’ve read a few of them and they seem to agree that an appropriate mask (like an N95 respirator) properly worn is effective. Surgical masks worn by sick people prevent larger droplet spread–which is a good thing, but don’t filter out small virus particles and don’t protect the healthy from infection.  It’s a mixed bag.  Frequent handwashing, and keeping serum Vitamin D levels up is probably more effective.

And when did something that costs $0.50 save anyone’s life?  Seems anything that life-changing would cost a pretty penny
Put another way, if masks cost $25 each would anyone wear one?

        I’ve had Covid19 for two weeks now.  Middle aged.  In good cardiovascular shape.  Used to drink too much.  Luckily I cut back in early autumn.  The fatigue is pretty bad.  The first week is the worst.  Then the fatigue slowly gets better.  On day 13 and 14, I’m started to feel like myself again.  Covid for me has basically been slight shortness of breath, mild head-cold, with heavy fatigue.  Energy depletion is not as bad as with flu.  But it’s significant.  Or to use the vogue term of the day, “meaningful”.  You’re pretty much stuck in bed for a week. Yep, that’s freaking meaningful.  It gets depressing.  Then 4 more days of being really tired and wanting to lay down all the time.  I’m no expert.  I’ve always cursed the masks but still thought it was a good idea. And after going through Covid, I’m even more in favor of them now. OK with laws enforcing them.  It’s a hassle.  I don’t think it’s more complicated than that.  I ask my fellow Dissidents here, to be judicious about what you’re dissenting about.  It’s often a fine line between being a badass dissident, and being a weenie. Wear the freaking mask for a little longer ok?  Being sick sucks.  Do what you can to make your fellows not sick.  That’s not a political position.

            Whatever I had in late 2018 was the worst of my life, and may have been a form of Covid.  If you recall that year around Christmas everyone in So Cal was always coughing for months.  I finally caught it and it made me pretty light headed and i was coughing all the time etcI think I may have even had a seizure, but I was coming out of a dream and couldn’t be sure of I was dreaming it or it was happeningAnyway it went away without vaccines or drugs and I’m probably better off for it from an immunity perspective

                Yes, I’ve always been grudgingly pro-mask.  To answer your question about acquiring Covid; I probably got it by going to independently owned bars where no one had to wear a mask.  Sometimes these pubs would have lots of people inside.  People get drunk and communicate through a kind of talk-barking. I picture lots of sickly droplets in the air. I was pretty much asking to get Covid.  I think my subconscious was like, “Let’s just get this over with, shall we?”  Also, there’s a lot of surface contact at bars.  With drink glasses and utensils.  Table tops, bathroom sink nobs, door handles, pens, money, etc.  Whatever the bartender has touched…and all they do is touch things…you’ve touched along with her.  I tend to rub my eyes out of lifelong habit.   Anyway, I’m glad it’s over and perhaps I’m immune for a while.   I’ll just say this.  You forget how crappy being sick feels, until you’re sick again.  Then you’re lying in bed feeling like fevered garbage and you’re all, ‘yeah, government is full of shit, but not completely full of shit.”

            All the people i know who got covid wore masks all the time and some just basically hid indoors. My mother just called me and they have another case in her retirement complex. That place has been in lockdown for months. So what can we really do but live on with common sense precautions.
btw, they won’t say who has the virus, resident or staff. Could just be another nefarious control mechanism. Glad you’re feeling better. None of the ones I mentioned had serious issues.

                The spread seems rather independent of lockdowns, masks, and other measures.  Only the short term rate of spread (and the level of resulting area immunity going forward) seems to be affected by those things.  There is a certain “let’s get this over with” mentality, at cross purposes with the “never let a crisis go to waste” thing going on.

            So you had the flu?Boohoo, I had a sinus infection 20 years ago that was far worse than anything you describe. I mean, golly–did your fraginas ache during this horrific trial too?I already wash my hands and avoid spraying snot on those around me. I have not been spraying snot and making others ill for many decades now, long and long before Mammy Government said so on the Teevee. Your experience may be different. I don’t know.I’ll say this, though–if I was allowing refugees into my fortress after a Collapse you would be denied entry based on this post alone.If you see yourself as some kind of dissident–look again.

                    As stated elsewhere, masks only work when they’re used responsibly by people who are sick; but here you were in a pub (let’s say) around people who were being irresponsible and going out-and-about while sick.  Now, forcing them to wear a mask is going to make them magically responsible?  They’re going to be prompt about switching out their proper mask every couple of hours instead of, say, wearing a diseased kerchief that they’ve been coughing into for days?

            So fucking what?Effeminate illness describing and extending your own feeling a bit fatigued to logically requiring global masks is  a pathetic position. You should be ashamed.Be a fucking man and stop sniveling about your own fatigue illness and others can look after themselves.

            I just got over Covid. Mid 50’s. Still drink just the right amount daily, it is part of my E. European makeup. Cough, no lack of energy, just the opposite, could not sleep as the meds, including Benzonatate and Hydrocodone cough medicine that my GP put me on kept me up at night. Used that up time to get caught up at work.My wife did not catch it although same house and bed, no masks. I rate it as about 40% of the last time I had the flu. Used an inhaler for the first time, luckily they basically give those away using coupons online; even a refill was free although I did not exceed the listed doses..My GP also had it, and his wife did not catch it nor did any of his kids in the same house.That is my experience, one person. I do not plan to mask alone outside or in my car, that is for neurotic women. Will NOT take some vaccine that might even have a .001% risk since even that risk outweighs the benefits.You mask. You take the jab. Let me know how it goes.

            Gee, sounds like when my husband and I both had the flu when our older son was about 3 and extraordinarily rambunctious.  We took turns lying on the floor keeping track of him while the other lay sick in bed.  For about 10 days.  And, amazingly enough, no one wore a mask!  No one wrote articles about us or cheered us as heroes!  And we didn’t even die!  Try your guilt-tripping scold mode on someone who gives a f&amp;&amp;k.

                “Try your guilt-tripping scold mode on someone who gives a f&amp;&amp;k.”  If you people weren’t so easily triggered you’d see I’ve been pretty even keeled here.  I said the flu fatigue is worse.  I’ve said nothing dramatic about my Covid experience.  And pretty much just said it would be nice if people wore a mask.  You’re one of the few women I’d truly enjoy beating the shit out of.  Like, beat you.  Wait 10 minutes for you to come-to again.  Then beat you more.  We’d do this for about 5 hours.
