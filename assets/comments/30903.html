        Appalachia’s finest band, Big Thief, has a new song in this vein, “Vampire Empire”:
I’ve had it with the jewsthere’s nothing left to choose
Like a vampire empire I amFall-ing, yeah, fall-ing
Even when it comes out wrong, the addition of Aryan White genes is like a supercharger; even this broken, deviant branch, I must say, does punch hard.

        This is the most realistic, level headed Realpolitik I’ve seen in decades.
More comprehensive, too, covering all the angles in a short, concise post.
Zman at his best.  Goodness, if only we had someone like this at the State Department.

        So I was watching some video of the Jewish settlers protesting in the mosque, and looking at how extraordinarily ugly and awkward-looking the teenaged males were.I wonder if all the spite, the viciousness, the endless need for revenge, is caused by that.  Imagine going through puberty looking either like Sam Bankman or Mclovin, depending on your BMI.  It also makes sense why that “zit-faced nerd gets the girl and beats the evil jock” is such a common Hollywood trope given the ethnicity of the writers, they’re all mentally trapped as teenagers and perpetually trying to get revenge for being a loser in high school.

            Did Whiskey get called up by the IDF?
It’s kinda eerie for the first poast on  a j00 thread not to be Whiskey.
If Whiskey gets rubbed out in the sh!t, then I’m almost gonna get kinda sorta melancholic.
I’ve been SMDHing at Whiskey for almost a decade now.
No Whiskey would be very very weird.
A strange new world.

        This weekend has been a stark reminder to me of why I went from being a fire-breathing warhawk in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 to almost entirely antiwar today.It has been sickening to watch both people I (normally) like and people I hate indulging in a celebration of violence and carnage — whether it’s carnage that has already happened or carnage that is yet to come. Not to go all hippie on you guys, but this kind of thing just poisons your soul. At some point over the past decade I got tired of poisoning my own soul with it. The only result I ever saw was that a lot of good people died and a lot of bad people never got punished. It’s all just such a waste and I want nothing to do with it.Now we’re going to have to go through all of that again, and I just can’t, man. I just can’t. Let the haters stew in their own hatred; I am already too overwhelmed from looking out for my own loved ones to get caught up in other people’s blood feuds. All I can do is mourn the innocent.This whole weekend has been incredibly depressing. If I still drank I would be at the bottom of a bottle right now.

            I’m with you.  I read this article(consider the source)https://www.unz.com/article/jewish-scholarship-exterminated-by-new-anti-semitism-definition/
It seems like all this reparations bullshit is misdirection about who was involved with the slave trade.  I think that what happen to the innocents in Israel is horrible.  But these mfers who provide the mayhem need to be stopped.

            That makes two of us Mr. B. Ten years ago I would have been spewing rage, spitting nails and baying for moslem blood for attacking our friends and allies like this. But then I learned who my friends and enemies really were.My enemies are right here. I know their faces, now, I know what their goals are, and I know what I am going to do if they get stupid about it. But – many things will have to go seriously wrong to get there from here.Be of good cheer! The dissident movement is growing now at an exponential rate. The bad guys are chitting where they eat, they are alienating themselves to everyone, and the entire world is starting to move against them. We are stronger than we think, we are smart and resourceful and we have friends everywhere. We will survive… and we will all be much better people for it.

            Notice all of the neocons calling for war on Iran.  More Americans have been killed in just this past year by illegal aliens than Israelis will have been killed in this attack.  A lot more.   If we were to be consistent then the neocons should advocate for levelling Mexico and several other Central and South American countries.Orders of magnitude more people have been killed in Ukraine by their own government from 2014 to 2022, than Israelis have ever been killed by Hamas.    Some populations are more important than others I suppose.If the U.S. starts a war with Iran that will be the military mistake of the century.    This is not 2003 and the U.S. Military is not what it once was.   Iran has lots of asymmetric and conventional ways of dealing with  the U.S.  Military.   Such a war will be far more dangerous and unpredictable than Iraq.

            Funny thing. MTG did her typical slime Gab that we must stand with Israel when this broke out. Got completely ratioed like 2000:1 (only put 1 bc can’t divide by 0).  Now, all her Gabs on the subject are along the lines we need to secure our border so we don’t end up like Israel. Guess she got the message.

        I think its World War 3.I think Israel will do everything it can to get/trick/bribe/false flag/etc the U.S. into ultimately directly fighting its neighbors for it, looking to settle scores while american jews, boomers, and jewish boomers are still in power.I think Russia, a patron of syria and friend of Iran, will want to use the situation to get back at the U.S. for supporting Ukraine, and will likely (in the long run) oblige Hezbollah, Hamas, Assad, et al with economic and military aid.I think China, desperate for oil supplies, will attempt to use Israel and its brutality (and russian/syrian exacerbation of it) to bridge the gap between Saudi Arabia and Iran, establishing itself as the Muslim/Arab oriented military and political hegemon of the Middle East.I think the U.S., run by confused old people living in a byegone era, will take the jewish bait. I think the U.S., in an attempt to “be strong everywhere” or “fight in israel so we don’t have to fight in taiwan/poland/nyc” (etc) will ultimately  attempt to “correct the mistakes” of ukraine by helping Israel win “right away,” similar to the “one and done” style ukraine aid package now being considered. I think this decision, even more impulsive than the one to intervene in Ukraine, will result in effectively all of the middle east not just nominally aligning against the U.S., but aligning with Russia and China.I think at that point, regardless of any specific military or political actions that have taken places (battles, embargos, sanctions, etc) the U.S. only options would be to either “surrender” and accept the reality of a blatantly anti american Eurasian/middle eastern/central Asian alliance, or go all out and fight the world.My guess is that the U.S. will choose the latter. My guess is that the U.S., like the british empire at the turn of the 20th century, will choose to fight a war to maintain their economic and political power. And my guess is, it will turn out just as badly.

        “Israeli warning to Hezbollah: IDF will destroy Damascus, target Syrian President Assad if Hezbollah joins war; US warships will support Israel in war. Message relayed via France”” from @IsraelRadar_com
This is exactly why, for decades, Mossad agents Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell targeted young non-Jewish white girls for rape, corruption, and soul destruction with their pedo-pimp blackmail organization, and why I imagine Mossad has also run other blackmail/threat organizations – to control American elites and ensure that the USA would self-destructively do Israel’s bidding specifically at a time like this.

            Something I wrote for my Gab page:I see the images from Israel, and I want to be sympathetic.  Many of the civilians killed look kind of like normal white people who would have been going about normal Western lives.  And the horde of Hamas fighters remind me of the mass of brown and black savages that riot and commit crime in America and Europe, many of whom would probably love to do something similar to us if they could.But then I remember that:* Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were Mossad agents who specifically targeted and were responsible for rape, corruption, and soul destruction of young non-Jewish white girls, pimping them out so as to be able to blackmail and control the American elites specifically so that they would do Israel’s bidding.* For decades, Israel has had the largest espionage network in the USA of any foreign nation, treating our information networks as exploitable farms for technology, information, and blackmail dirt.  They have sometimes sold our secrets off to other nations, as benefits Israel.  And they seem to consider Jonathan Pollard a hero.* Israelis and pro-Israeli American Jews manipulated America into invading Iraq.  And, Osama bin Laden said Al Qaeda did largely in anger at America’s support for Israel, after which America invaded Afghanistan for revenge for 9/11.  So, Israel was in large part responsible for wars done on behalf of Israeli interests that killed and maimed tens of thousands of Americans, bankrupted the nation, and killed a million Muslims.* Israel’s level of oppression, murder, and dehumanization of Palestinians would make a complete international pariah any other nation.  They bomb Syria and Lebanon at will, taking both nations at times teetering on the edge as humanitarian-disaster failed states.   Israel constantly aggressively cyber-attacks Iran.  And Israel helped grow and sustain of ISIS.* Israel siphons and drains (steals) billions in “aid” from American taxpayers each year, for no benefit of the US* Pro-Israelis corrupt and distort American law by making Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movements illegal, behavior that would be constitutionally legally protected if it was against any other country* Last month, Israeli weapons and training enabled Azerbaijan to ethnically cleanse 150k Armenian Christians from their ancestral homeland in Nagorno-Karabakh* A case can be made that Israelis knew about 9/11 – but did not warn the USA because they wanted to give us a reason to go to war with Muslims – and that they possibly were behind the killing JFK – because he was forcefully pressuring them to shut down their Dimona nuclear weapons program.  They certainly militarily killed American sailors on the USS Liberty.* The billionaires, NGOs, etc in America that are the most dual citizen/pro-Israel are also among those the most pro-oppression and removal of rights of whites in the USA.Israel is normal America’s number one international enemy, the nation that does middle class America the most harm, and one of the most evil nations in the world.  So, nope.  Not much sympathy.

                Israel and its quislings in the USA and allies did 911 or were accessories to it before and after the fact.  Bin Laden and those associated with him plus allot of Muslims were the patsies and subsequent victims of Jew led aggression.This is the truth so quit worshipping and obeying Jews for they are of their father the devil.

        My lifetime experience of 50 plus cycles around the sun, and my inside knowledge from living inside their communities for decades leads me to a singular conclusion with corollary:  death to all small hats, all even “the good ones,” and nuke their corpses from orbit just to be sure.

        I think Israel is going to walk into a carefully-set trap. Bibi has already vowed to annihilate Gaza and has called up 300,000 troops. But Gaza is so densely populated, it is a guarantee that the IDF will end up killing and maiming thousands of women and children. There will be plenty of Arab cell phone video out there making the IDF look like monsters.Beyond that, the only way the IDF can take on Hamas in a dense urban environment is house-to-house fighting, where Israeli air power and technology will be neutralized. Hamas will be able to inflict serious casualties on the IDF with basic infantry weapons like RPGs and rifles. It will quickly turn from a one-sided fight into a peer conflict. Kind of like what happened to the Sixth Army at Stalingrad.How ironic.

            Could you imagine if the Taliban and some Ukie arms dealers have been kitting them out with Javelins and other anti-tank weapons for the past few years?I don’t think that happened as the Palestinians are not that organized (barring this incident) and truthfully, are not really well liked in the region other than as political pawns. But it would be some wild sh-t if they had amassed lots of “surplus”  courtesy of Uncle Sam’s ignoble retreat from Afghanistan and the fact that we are throwing so much hardware at Ukraine that I’m sure is leaking into the black market.Imagine a couple Javelins squads every few blocks while you are sending your tanks into an urban center?

        The Ultra-Orthodox are exempt from military service. A quick Google says they are about 13% of Israel, expected to grow to 33% by 2060. For a while that’s a tolerable minority avoiding serving, but long-term it seems a weakening factor.The Arab citizens of Israel are forbidden from it. At least the reasons for this particular case is fairly easy to grasp, even by an obtuse observe such as yours truly. Arabs are 17-21% of the population, depending upon citizenship.By my figuring, that means that a third of the population won’t serve in the military. For the remainder, if Israel has similar standards to America it means the vast majority of even young adults are unfit for service.A fact (I believe it’s a fact) I rarely see discussed, even in dissident circles, is that the Diaspora Jews are very much of two (or more) minds when it comes to the whole Zionist thing. I’m not sure any Hebrew specifically wishes evil upon the Nation-State of Israel, but I suspect that many are rather indifferent to its fate. In normal times it’s a nice tourism destination for a family trip, or to send the kids on a school work-study program. In a pinch the easy citizenship and the added bonus of the impossibility to extradite a citizen are a boon, too. Major point: Judaism is far from monolithic. Perhaps I’m oversimplifying a complex topic, but seems to me that given that Israel has existed as a nation for 75 years or so, any Jew who wanted to relocate to the Holy Land would have by now.In any event, there’s a lot of money to be made in the usual business of banking, commercial trade, and less noble enterprises. No need to take sides; everybody’s money is good.I take no opinion on the current intrigues. Zman seems to have given a plausible overview of the current players.

            “ The Ultra-Orthodox are exempt from military service.”
They are exempt, when in yeshiva—and some spend their whole lives there.  But more importantly, as I remember, they were allowed to enlist in the IDF by rabbinical decision some time ago.  The importance is that in a generation or so, the Hasidic will be the *majority* population in Israel.  Israel, however you think it now, will be a greater threat when these extreme folk are in charge and have military power as well as political power.

        I don’t have a dog in the fight but I wonder if there will be a Jewish equivalent of a “sino Soviet split”. Maybe you could call it a “tel Aviv new York split”.
Israel has a different selection bias in the type of Jews who live there. Maybe it’s not as pronounced as I think but I wonder if the secular liberal American Jews see Israel as a lost cause.

        Back in the 1980s and 1990s I was a young Reagan neocon. I read National Review and I sided with Israel. How could I not? Yasser Arafat was a lunatic and a caricature of an Arab terrorist. The Israelis seemed sane by comparison. It was sort of like siding with the cops against the Black Panthers and Angela Davis.I still dislike the Palestinians, I think they are barely one step above Negroes on the evolutionary ladder. I don’t condone rape and hostage taking and suicide bombers and ululating like animals in the streets.But this one is totally on Israel. The obnoxious Jews keep pushing and goading the stupid Palestinians. Just last week the Jews defiled the al-Aqsa mosque. Just last week Jews were arrested for spitting on Christians. God forbid if any of the goyim were to do things like that to THEM, though.The Jews have no ability to be introspective, they have no idea how obnoxious and arrogant and offensive they are. Gaza is basically the equivalent of the Warsaw Ghetto, and they Jews just don’t get it. Israel is an expansionist  ethnostate for the Jews only. They want lebensraum on the West Bank, so they are encroaching on Palestinian land and when Arabs freak out and start throwing rocks, the Jews shoot them.When Nazi Germany did all of this, the Jews flipped out. But it’s OK for THEM to do it, because after all they are “God’s Chosen People” and they get to do whatever the fuck they want.I don’t side with Israel any more. I don’t side with the Palestinians. I don’t care. I am almost sixty and this shit has been going on and on and on my ENTIRE LIFE with no end in sight. Yet for as long as I can remember, the U.S. government and media have been absolutely obsessed with Israel, the “Arab-Israeli conflict,” and the “peace process.” You’d think that Israel was the fucking 51st state, for Christ’s sake. Actually they care MORE about Israel and Palestine than they do about East Palestine, Ohio. They care MORE about the Israeli border than the U.S. border. We’re basically ruled by an elite clique of imperialists that literally cares more about Middle Eastern desert foreigners with “dual citizenship” than they do about Americans in the fucking Midwest.Well, I DON’T care. I don’t care if the entire Levant gets turned into a glass parking lot tomorrow. Let them kill each other and let Allah — or Yahweh, or whomever  — sort them out.Not my monkeys, not my circus.

            Great comment. I’m rooting for injuries, and here’s to hoping the “elite clique of imperialists” eventually suffer a few and I live long enough to see it happen. Also, moronic Scofield Bible buffoons are ignorantly fueling their own oppression, and I am laughing at reports of some of them getting caught in the crossfire. In NYC–the (soon-to-be former due to demographics) Big Tel Aviv, pro-Palestinian crowds are cheering the carnage, some undulating. There’s some karma in my lifetime. There are absolutely no sympathetic parties in this crapfest and I could care less beyond the amusement.

            Gods chosen people are those who choose Jesus Christ only.Most Jews are antichrist and racist pagans who teach for doctrines the commandments of men instead of those of God.To demystify the Jews you have to accept the truth and that is that Jesus is the son of God from outer space and that he meant what he said in John 8:44.  Otherwise he would be a Jew and be condemned by John 8:44 and the whole bible would be a load of Hebrew nonsense with no authority what so ever.  Then the joke would be on humanity and we would be alone in the universe with no higher power over us but our selves.  Perhaps not fatal but it could be just a tad dangerous as humans tend to be unpredictable, ruthless and self centered at times.

                Perhaps. But the market sure didn’t respond favorably to Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine. Frankly, I was expecting a bloodbath on Wall Street today, and it didn’t materialize.

                It’s also inflationary at just the time that the Fed has raised rates in a way that’s never been seen before to slow inflation.
Iran still exports a fair amount of oil. Basically, the market is saying that this conflict doesn’t spillover into a big attack on Iran, or, at least, that Iranian oil will continue to flow.

            Maybe there is a belief that Israel and world Jewry are invincible and this whole silly affair in Gaza will go away after Israel exterminates the Palestinians and their allies once and for all.  The issue of genocide will be swept under the rug because Jews are deemed to be the master race and divine gods on earth just like Menachem Begin is reputed to have claimed in a speech in the Knesset long ago.

        Conveniently, a couple weeks ago: U.S. allows Israelis visa-free entry.   One could simply hand the Palestinians a passport and a ticket and a good bye.
Noam Chomsky does that bit where the Israelis are put upon by the United States as an output. Maybe, but some support is needed for that claim.  It seems more the reverse, that Israel is a nuclear armed gangster-bankster safe zone, propped up by duped Americans.
Propaganda people say the Gazans invaded Israel.  Isn’t it more accurate to say they broke out from Gaza?

                Now that you mentioned it, that does make a lot of sense.  Wikipedia has, and may still, mention that the OSS/CIA was heavily Jewish.  Frankfurt-School Commiejew Marcuse landed into a comfortable home in the OSS/CIA, and then on into academia.   Ones gott to wonder about Marcuse’s Marxist pupils.
And now, Chomsky, yet another thing to look up and into.

        I think this is the beginning of a new trend. If the American military is now seen more and more as a paper tiger, then this goes doubly so for the militaries of America’s proxy states. The myth of the hypercompetent IDF and the hypercompetent Mossad was just dealt a blow from which it will never recover. Without the backing of Western money, Western weapons, and most importantly Western intelligence services, Israel was and is nothing, and now that the source of its strength has ebbed, there is little standing between Israel and annihilation.Now here’s an intriguing question. What were Shoigu and Kim really talking about in North Korea? The absurd idea that Russia was there to buy artillery shells is just the sort of thing of the West would tell itself, but it is absolute nonsense to anyone who understands Russian industrial capacity. It seems almost impossible to think that the DPRK is about to begin an assault on the South, but just last week it seemed almost impossible that Hamas was about to capture Israeli military bases inside Israel.The dominoes are falling fast and the calculus changes with each new imperial defeat. Attacks upon South Korea, Taiwan, and even Japan are not unthinkable now, and neither are armed incursions of irregulars into America proper from across the southern border. The imperial collapse augurs an extremely nasty and destructive few decades as the hubris of empire is liquidated. This is unfortunately necessary to bring some sanity back into Western domestic politics.

            Agree on Korean powwow. It seems Russia and Iran share the “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee” diplomatic ethos. Of course Israel is a past master at modeling this style. After initially being irritated by it this time I realized the false-flag theory contingent is not incompatible with own-goal theory. After all with 9/11 at home we had Avengers Assemble avant la lettre, all narrative and grand designs to the expense of any and all practical concerns— Why would Tel Aviv be any different? That “Living in M.E. makes you a realist” line of bull turns out to be self-parodical; actually it makes you a sitting target for local psychos.

        I frankly couldn’t care less about this flare up. I only hope one day we can be free of them and their influence on the US.  WHY should any American care about some non-state actor attacking Israel? Why do we have to suffer wall to wall coverage of it?  All of these Zionists should just move to Israel. Their ethnostate needs them.

            I can’t follow this stuff closely, but I am concerned the “solution” will be moving a million or so people who Israel no longer wants in close proximity with them here.  We definitely need to watch out for that. Hopefully the neocons hate them so much for attacking Israel they won’t accept that solution.

            Hamas is looking for a big body count in Gaza.  The bigger the better (they will all go instantly to the arms of Allah anyway as this is war).  A completely disproportionate response.  Ideally aided by the U.S.   The death figures need to be at least five digits.  Cameras will be everywhere recording it.  Pieces of toddlers, etc.  Then the Arab word will say “was that really necessary?”   Israel can only target civilians in that big rat warren and call them terrorists anyway.  Israel will say that they killed 10k+ terrorists, whatever the figure will be.  In the U.S. the warhawk boomers will have their first non viagra induced erections since 2003 as they satiate their blood lust for a day.In the meantime the PR backlash in the Middle East will be anti Israel and and anti U.S., with all future peace treaties on ice.  Should we attack Iran’s refineries and petroleum stockpiles, the global price of oil will spike, adding even more pressure to the western economies.  They win again.   The Iranian regime will then wave the bloody shirt at home, getting a badly needed spike in domestic support.  Bonus points.What Hamas and Iran are betting on is Jewish spite.  A spite perfectly outlined by Shakespeare in “The Merchant of Venice.”  They can’t contain it.  They can’t resist it.   You see this spite in Ukraine policy among the neo-cons.

                    Ploppy, do you have an example of George’s spite in mind?  Ethnic conflicts aside, I always enjoyed Seinfeld quite a bit and would enjoy revisiting it.

                        Larry David was quoted as saying George’s mother couldn’t possibly be anything other than Jewish.  As far as spite, there’s the jerk store episode, poisoning his boss when he didnt’ let him use his private bathroom, following someone for 100 miles because he thought he got flipped the bird, and the scholarship kid that wanted to be an urban planner instead of just an architect (the Van Buren boys episode).  Those are the ones that spring to mind.

                An attack on the mosque would be just the provocation to justify an attack on Israel.  The last straw if you like.There are always provocations when it comes to wars and those provocations are always denied by the guilty parties who declare war on the victims of those provocations.It is an old tactic repeated often in history.

            “ WHY should any American care about some non-state actor attacking Israel? ”
Well, because—unlike in the 30’s—the Israeli’s may well become refugees and therefore be allowed resident status in the USA.  What would be the effect of doubling or tripling the present population?  Not sure, but I doubt it will be positive.

        Imagine a scenario in which both China and Russia are pushing for a regional peace conference, but Washington and Israel are pushing for war with Iran, but neither has the means to do it.
If peace talks could bring a cease fire, it would only benefit IsraelUSA.  Give it time to restock, and since when has IsraelUSA ever abided by a “peace agreement”?

            Zman nailed how the U.S. negotiates:  “Decades of looting and grifting have left the empire unable to follow through on its threats. As a result, the world is becoming less afraid of Washington’s bluster and bullying.”
Threats, bluster and bullying.  That about covers it.  Sincere negotiations to avoid war hasn’t occurred to the creeps in the US government since I don’t know when.
War is the worst most wasteful thing imaginable, but the elites think it’s worth toying with.

                Well, certain groupings make major bank on armament sales, so there’s that. But there are also major groupings who wereplanningon making major bank off of the Ukraine conflict by acquiring tracts of prime agricultural land for a song, and/or “reconstruction”, but I think that they may never get that chance, seeing how things are going. As Wild Geese is fond of saying, “You just love to see it”.As to the Middle East, already rhe conflict is spreading, with the Zionist Entity bombing in Southern Lebanon after some exchanges with Hizbollah. Too much bombing on Gaza with resultant casualties might provoke attacks from the East as well, and in Syria there are some Russian air defense missiles that may get a green light to counter attacks. How now, Bibi?And if the spigot for ME oil gets shut off, with the SPR almost nonexistent, that’s a problem. And then, there are all of those unvetted males of military age that have been pouring over the border who might get put into play. Whoo hoo.

        I was checking through some Israeli news sources and most were surprisingly candid about Israel’s border security lapses over the last year. The Jew enthusiasts are, as per their habitual inclinations, tying themselves into pretzels explaining this as an Israeli false flag. I guess. I’m not really convinced with Z’s take on this either; which is just another variation of the Jew enthusiasts’ interpretation. It’s not like the Palestinians don’t observe and notice trends in border security measures. After all they are responsible for most of the incursions. Nah, the Israeli’s got caught with their pants down and got bummed hard. Surprise surprise they’re taking advantage of a disaster that came along at a convenient time. Seriously, Z, 87 degree chess tactics don’t always apply with Jews.

                Sloth is another word for boredom.  Humans can only keep up vigilance in the face of no active threat for so long.  Leaving the current Israeli conflict aside, does anyone notice such lax behavior in the USA as compared to the decade after 9/11?Of course, we see such reports—if looked for—quite frequently.  That’s one of the reasons why rogue States like North Korean are of such concern—not that they’ll start a nuke war against South Korea, or even invade, but that they’ll transfer such nuke devices to terrorists who’ll smuggle them into the USA.Here-to-fore such concern was also shared by such actors as China and Russia.  But in face of a swiftly declining GAE, perhaps they are reconsidering?

        Iran, if it is behind the most recent flare-up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is waging a proxy war with Israel. It is unlikely to end well for the Palestinians. But Iran will not be in a position to dictate terms. It’s more of a spoiler conflict to put off Saudi recognition of Israel in exchange for U.S. assistance in the nuclearization of that country. Others can play that game. If Russia were to more actively involve itself in Iran’s peaceful nuclear program, and Tel Aviv were threatened, a path to peace might quickly be found in Ukraine. At present, Russia lacks leverage with America because the latter country’s rulers don’t care all that much if its people die or not. Officially, they claim the Russians are bluffing. But they may also be calculating that their fellow travelers will have a chance to get out before anything really bad happens, as they did in Ukraine.

            “ If Russia were to more actively involve itself in Iran’s peaceful nuclear program, …”You forget, Russia a while back *offered* to supply Iran with all it’s processed uranium needs, thereby eliminating in house uranium processing by Iran.  Russia would assure ample supply of uranium purified for energy generation rather that more highly processed bomb making stuff which Iran was suspected of producing on the side.Not sure if Iran was willing, but am sure the US rebuffed this proposal out of hand so it never got to the bargaining table.  Russia was at that time more willing to cooperate with the USA in the Middle East.

                Russia has been acting in compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The U.S. opposes such legal use of nuclear power by Iran because Israel thinks they might use it to develop nuclear weapons the way Israel did. At the same time the U.S. is cynically prepared to help Saudi Arabia with such an illegal nuclear program in exchange for that country’s open support for Israel. If Russia were to play the same game, Israel could find itself in a difficult situation. An example of the U.S. talking up “democracy” and “the rules based order” while doing the opposite.

                        Two different things: fissionable material and know-how. Jewish scientists had been involved in U.S. nuclear research and development since the Manhattan Project. This know-how made its way to the Soviet Union and presumably Israel. The peaceful nuclear reactor Israel built with the help of France provided the enriched material they needed to construct atomic bombs. Israel wants to keep this capacity out of Iranian hands, since the bomb-making know-how is pretty widely known by now.

        Another consequence of these events will be the resurgence of Sunni extremist movements that had largely been contained. Saudi, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and the gulf states will come under increasing pressure to support the Palestinians, and some governments may fall. Israel eventually may find itself facing an general Arab coalition backed by Iran, Russia and China. Unlike in previous conflicts, the recent Saudi-Iran rapprochement means that the Israelis will not be able to exploit the Sunni-Shia Muslim schism as they have in the past. The position of Turkey and Pakistan will also be interesting.Unfortunately there is a grim and inevitable logic at work here. Israel doesn’t really have any choice but to respond harshly, and neither will her Muslim adversaries. Atrocity porn makes for impressive propaganda.We, however, do have a choice.  We should stay out of it, but we probably won’t.

            “We, however, do have a choice. We should stay out of it, but we probably won’t.”“We” are staying out of it as no one in my orbit is volunteering to murder arabs for Israel.  If you’re using the anachronistic grammatical tick of identifying yourself and the rest of us with the US regime…  “we” in that sense from the secretary of state (and nearest thing to an actual POTUS we have) on down through the shot calling roles in government/corporate complex and media establishment are basically just jews.  That misnamed “we” are not out of it and cannot and will not ever be out of it.You and I might prefer to put our own people interests ahead of a foreign hostile people… but since when has that ever mattered to them?  We’re called “cattle” for a reason and cattle arent generally consulted if they’d like to be used to meat on a given day.The real WE who are from the USA geographically and culturally are the people that the ostensible “we” of the USA regime would like to see dead.  Just like Ukraine, a plan for slaughtering the locals is a saved step when youre using them to slaughter your distant enemies.

A good question is whether this is because they are insulated from modernity or whether their very nature is conducive to high fertility. The only closed communities that have low birth rates are ones that explicitly condemn reproduction, like the shakers.

                There’s a lot going on there, kinda like “arranged marriages in all but name” (or, maybe in name too).  The kids are brought up with a clear idea of who they and their people are and are constantly interacting with those of the opposite sex who were raised the same way.  Restated, leaving the future propagation of one’s people up to dumb luck has proven to be a stupid strategy.

                A strong desire to reproduce is likely the default attitude that gets crushed by interaction with clownworld. They tend to insulate themselves from all the propaganda and pressures to absorb the cultural zeitgeist. This is also why then tend to keep their children far away from TV, internet, modern kid’s books and most of all, public schools.  Plus, everyone they interact with have the same values.  That’s why closed communities work very well where closed “families” do not. If not isolated from the larger culture, even homeschooling isn’t enough.The Amish accomplish all this through their shunning of electricity. No electricity means no radio, no TV and no internet.  Their Amish schools keep them out of the public schools.  Their shindigs for kids keeps the kids fraternizing with only other Amish kids.

                Always thought the antipathy towards Indians for their arranged marriages was odd. In reality, it’s one of the few things they do right. One could argue they are too strict with not enough flexibility to young people, but the principle of parents in a community coming together and finding good matches is a clear positive.

                    Chet:  I don’t think it’s merely antipathy at arranged marriages – as you note, having parental involvement/approval of a ‘match’ was the historic norm, even in the West, for centuries.  While not quite as inbred as their Pakistani neighbors, the Indians are still very careful to ensure marriages not merely within caste, but within sub-jati.  Often this is further narrowed by profession and geographical region.My geneological research over the past 5-8 years has caused us to be contacted by numerous 6th cousins of my husband.  The shared ancestor is generally from the 1700s.  These people are utter strangers to my husband.  How many of us even know who our 3rd cousins are?  I don’t.  Yet the average Indian in the West will know his extended family including distant cousins and numbering many hundreds of people – and he will provide and demand favors and obligations from them.It’s still a very much American discomfort with/distaste for a tribal society.

                The ultra-orthodox Hasidic community in Israel is an interesting phenomena.  They will be the political/population majority within 1-2 generations. Prior to somewhat recent events, they were exempt from military service, but a decade or so ago, the rabbi’s said they may take up arms in national service, i.e., IDF.  That would seem to promise both political and military power being in the control of the most zionistic, pro-Israel faction who hate all non-Jews and especially secular Jews.  (Imagine how Iran changed with the fall of the secular government in the late 70’s.)

                As I understand it, this was a “Rave for Peace”. The participants are not fans of the hardcore zionists, and vice versa. But, given the dynamics of the situation, one might see how the Palestinian jihadis might view this “Rave for Peace” as just a bunch of liberal Jews virtue signaling, like the words from Nine Inch Nails song Head Like a Hole, “…let’s go dancing on the backs of the bruised…”

                Well, a rave here (USA), initially started as an outdoor concert-like party where young folks gathered to listen to music, drink, dance, and do drugs.  The organizers sold tickets and refreshments to make a profit.  The women dressed like they would on Halloween—that is to say, sluts.  And a good time was had by all.  They are still popular today, except they don’t use the name “rave”.Where I was at that time we had a regular venue a few miles up the road most Saturday nights.  Was a pain to drive along the highway as the Sheriff’s patrol was stopping everyone leaving.  Easy pickings for drugged drivers.  Only good thing was almost immediately upon seeing an old White guy in a truck (me) they said, “Have a nice night.” and cut me loose.  😉

                    Yeah, I knew there was something back in the first half of the 60s called “rave ups” that were some sort of party. Must’ve been a mod thing. But that was a very long time ago, and I’m a bit surprise that hoary term has made a comeback.

                        The term was in use at least into the 90’s here.  The rave drug of choice was called “ecstasy” and at that time was legal in Europe, so large amounts easily found their way here.  Sammy “The Bull” Gravano and his son were trafficking it out of Phx.  Sammy got caught and did a stint (8 years?) in the hard max pen in CO.The new “raves” are now called “festivals” and the girls still dress like sluts, except with less taste—if that’s possible.  Body painting is big.One effect of ecstasy was a dryness of the mouth and a visual hallucination of sorts wrt light.  Lights being waved in front of the eyes would seem to “lag” and stretch out into long strings.  Sort of like a camera with the lens open and drawing a picture on the film.  Hence a “raver” could be spotted with a pacifier in his/her mouth and a “light stick” in hand.I kid you not.

            It’s possible there were children of VIPs at that rave. It’s also possible Hamas (or their backers) had enough intel to justify making that rave a focal point of the initial raids with the goal of taking VIP kids hostage.

        Where to begin?1. The official Regime story is almost certainly false. We still have no idea of exactly what happened and we may never.2. There are 2 million people living in Gaza. If the Israelis flatten the place, where are they all going to go? Are the Israelis prepared to kill thousands livestreamed on Telegram? (I suppose they will disable the Internet). And if the Palests. leave Gaza and go to Egypt, are things just going to go to hell in a handbasket in Egypt? There are 113 million people in Egypt now. Average age is 24.3. Beyond all the frantic gesticulating by Neocons on TV, precisely what does “war with Iran” entail? I suppose the USAF and the Israeli Air Force can strike their supposed nuclear facilities and oil refineries. This blithely assumes that Iran doesn’t already have a bomb ready to go. Then what? There are 84 million people in Iran – 4x Ukraine. Average age is 33.The Regime is just thrashing around now with no coherent, long-run strategy. We have seen the limits of our “kinetic” diplomacy in Iraq and Afghanistan. Insanity is doing the same crap over and over and expecting a different result….

            I suspect Israel intends to relocate the Gazans into the West, but that will not go over well in the neighborhood. Egypt is too close for comfort for the relocation zone. The West, of course, needs neither more Jews nor Arabs, thank you.

                Sinai desert is empty AF. They can send them on their own little “Exodus” out there, Moses style! We will see if they can reach Egypt in less than 40 years. 😛
I feel like ancient Hebrews do not have a great direction sense, 40 years to cross a piece of land that is 700km wide seems a bit… confused.
Like I said before, have NO dog in this fight so long as they aren’t sending them to us.

        First, serious events are accelerating. That should be obvious, but normie can quash that anxiety with another six pack. Second, desperation within the GAE is pushing stupidity into hyperdrive. Putin just gave a speech warning the West about using tactical nukes in a false flag OP. Clearly their intel believes this threat to be very real. Third, the gambit in Israel is another dry run exercise, much like COVID. Pit the bottom of the social pyramid against each other in mortal combat so that no one thinks about addressing the root of the problem. When food starts getting scarce, the diversity bazaar will turn on each other everywhere in the West, thus keeping those elite enclaves secure. Fourth, the key lesson of both Gaza and Ukraine is that nothing is truly secure anymore. The real enemy is not a peer, its a pathogen. Act accordingly.

            I attended a house service with an evangelical pastor a couple weeks ago (he’s a good pastor and the service is at our neighbor’s, also good people, but I am not an evangelical Christian) and he started in on prophesy and the end times, and mentioned that Jews need to rebuild the temple before Christ returns. I kinda rolled my eyes. Evangelicals say this kind of stuff a lot. They also tend to think that the end times are near. But after the events of the past weekend, maybe he’s onto something…

        Gawd, where to start?  To repeat what I noted yesterday, a plague on both their houses.  Not my people, not my problem.  Let them fight it out, but without one drop of White American blood.  Which leads to one noting how so many ‘murkans’ have been wrapping themselves in flags and pledging to fight.  Of course, the flag is Israel’s and the military they propose joining is the IDF.  Supporting ‘their’ people – fair enough.But for the love of all that’s holy, let’s stop with the ‘murkan’ facade.  Just like the “German” tattoo artist who was killed these are all juice supporting their own people.  Please bear that in mind, boomers, neocons, and conservatard lurkers.  Aside from the fact that no White man ought to be joining the United Colors and  Degenerates masquerading as the US military, it’s well worth noting that said juice do not generally volunteer for the US armed forces, and those that do (like Mikey Weinstein) don’t have White heritage American interests at heart.Since none of us have any say in what the Nuland-Nudelman/Blinken/Mayorkas/Garland-Garfinkle regime do, we cannot affect the short or long-term consequences of this newest iteration of a centuries’ old tribal blood feud.  What we ought to do, however, is consider how to mitigate the follow-on effects for White Americans.  Gee, Biden cancelled the Keystone Pipeline and emptied the Strategic Oil reserve . . . and the odds of a new variant of oil embargo have suddenly increased dramatically.  Odds on gas prices doubling in the next few months?Those of us who watched in horror and disgust as Turks and Kurds clashed in German or Swedish cities now get to behold the same spectacle here, times ten.  Schumer and his financial backers versus The Squad.  The only guaranteed loser is the heritage American.  All those magic dirt/magic paper numurkans bring their genetics, culture, and politics with them . . . even if they put on a thin facade of jeans and pizza.  As the old saw goes, third-world people, third-world country, third-world problems.We are told to celebrate with twisted faux compassion as we are invaded by millions of hostile, uncivilized aliens . . . but the world must tremble in outrage and demand revenge because the 51st state’s fenced borders were broached.No long-term predictions because I cannot ‘think’ like a psychopath bent on world domination and destruction.  But literally nothing is off the table if this expands, as it is highly likely to do.  You are going to be coerced and castigated into supporting “Our Greatest Allie” with blood and treasure, like it or not.  Don’t let yourself get caught up in the lies and propaganda war.   So stock up, store up (kicking myself for dawdling in filling the 35-galon wheeled gas can/pump we purchased), and look to your own and their health and safety.  No one else will.

            Spot on about fuel prices/shortages. As for the Semitic tribes duking it out, that has happened here. There have been Muslims and Jews (and their ignorant camp followers) come to blows in Florida and California, and I’m certain Michigan as well although that last is just a guess on my part. Invade the world, invite the world, become the Third World.As Kosher as the present regime is, though, it will have a hard time keeping its foot soldiers in line on support for Israel, which many of them despise. This may be an instance where the installation of Biden helps us.

            3g4me,Nailed it madame.Always bring it back around to the sphere of influence vs. concern.Family, Church, neighbors, town , county etc… in a spiral outward to the limits of your influence. Only awareness past that point for Intel purposes.The greater world will be what it will be.On a practical side, I’ve put away some diesel even though none of my equipment burns it. Neighbors and the local equipment rental place have bigger diesel equipment like skid-steers that you may need to borrow for road repairs or tilling, and if fuel is interrupted or skyrockets it isn’t bad to have 20-30 gallons on hand.

                Penitent Man:  Thank you, Sir.  We don’t have anything that requires diesel as yet, but we do need non-ethanol gas for the zero turn, side by side, etc.  Uncomfortable storing fuel in summer temps but saw this movable tank in YT video from guy in Florida, and husband said to get it.  Trusting that Pri-G and rotating will keep it usable.Neighbor has a small tractor but we have no need as yet.  I like what I’ve seen of the e-trikes, but they aren’t in the budget at present and wouldn’t be safe (too slow) on our local two-lane road to town (why 60 mph isn’t enough for some folks on corkscrew curves I do not understand).

        Regardless, this attack could not come at a better time for the Israeli government—Interesting that.Of course it wouldn’t be the most surprising thing that a domestic security service knew about some catastrophic event, but then did nothing to interfere with it because there were only “upsides” in letting it go forward.

            What worries me, #99:
What happens if we send more aid to Israel? This conversation may leak out:
“Now hang on now, Big Guy, don’t you know how many terrorist cells we have already prepositioned in your country?”
“My country? Come on man, I’m a globalists! Transnationalist. Don’t be so narrow minded!”

        Every road my mind went down thinking about this found it all too convenient for Israel. It is hard to see how they lose, aside from their people who have been killed or kidnapped. But states, don’t care about such things. It is like when America was attacked on our soil and it happened to be the event that the PNAC signatories had hoped for a few years before. This event is also helpful on the US vassal front as Musk and the momentum of those goings on will be crushed in order to present solidarity. Another red pill Musk will be taking in public.I am not looking forward to the coming months of focus on yet another foreign country and international proxy joust that gets put before our People and our Nation. There was a story last night about how law enforcement across the nation was stepped up and sent to protect Jewish buildings and areas in the United States. There was no such mobilization in 2020 to protect our property, no outcry over our collective demonization, not the blink of an eye over the obvious coup we underwent. Even today, that 22 year old newlywed American girl beheaded by some African immigrant was unreported.I assume this is going to be obvious to a lot of people. This is going to be an interesting litmus test. Ukraine was the next thing that was easy for people to oppose or turn on. The kinds of opposition that formed and could be expressed to Ukraine may have similar currents brewing with the latest intrigue. However, if they cannot be expressed, we’ll all have to figure out what conclusions to draw.In the end, I want to live in a nation that cares for its own people and whose government and leading elites take actions that on the whole are of a net benefit to the people. Living in this dumpster fire where we go down and everyone else gets lifted upat our expense is getting really old.P.S. Today is Columbus Day. Acknowledge that with someone you know and tip your hat to the monumental civilization whose shoulders he stood upon as he and his men explored the vast unknown.

            The cognitive dissonance required to keep a single one about a foreign dust-up while your own country is under active invasion is off the charts. A relatively positive thing is there are now quite a few people who think like us on this state of affairs.
And, yes, Happy Columbus Day! That fine event also corresponded with the Reconquista. It can and will be done again.

            Columbus day is the 12th. This is observed even though I think people call it indigenous peoples day or something stupid like that now because, you know, it was bad that we stopped them from ripping the hearts out of living victims and cannibalism.

            The frustraing aspect is how last week griller cons basically knew everything the regime (media) says is a lie but TODAY they’ll stand foursquare behind the regime in its account of and interpretation of events AND EVEN the actions it demands.Americans (read: whites) are such damnably nice people that they simple seem incapable of keeping their enemies named in their head for over a day.  Yesterday you beat me half to death, spit on my body, laughed and carried off my daughter… today you invite me to help you move furniture and I simply cannot resist the urge to extend a hand and a hearty “no hard feelings bro!”

        ” It is just that the West is in decline and that means these outposts will be abandoned or overrun as part of the process of decline. If Israel is to survive it means becoming something other than an outpost of the West. If the West is to survive, it means abandoning these outposts and setting about the task of renewal.”The Reconquista II Boogaloo after the fall of the present-day Kingdom of Jerusalem, Tranny Bagel Version, will be where the real action is. The question is whether the United States still will be able to project force into its old satrapies and on which side it will enter. Your guess is as good as mine on either count.The imperial collapse does seem to be accelerating. It may take decades or could happen overnight, but that event is on the horizon now. This may forestall that day because, as you point out, it has distracted from Putin making “Biden” his little bitch. Nonetheless, friend and foe alike has taken notice that the GAE is an old, rapidly fading whore. The present already is unpleasant and living through the winding down likely will be horrible, but interesting times ahead indeed.As for the Israel-Hamas battle, sometimes things are exactly what they seem to be, cigars and all. The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Tranny Version, also is incompetent and unhinged at this point, and the visual of jihadis rushing a rave would have made George Romero proud. Maybe the Arabs will step up the plate and eventually dub DAWN OF THE HEBES into English and we all can enjoy it when the power comes on for a few hours.

                The differences between the chosen and us in sexuality illustrates that different races have different collective personalities.
The chosen have always been more sexuality perverse than us, from our perspective.  Of course, they see us as repressed, like Freud did.  We’re just different.
The chosen pioneered the first tranny surgery in Weimar Germany.  They have much less sexual dimorphism that we do.  We’re just different.
Much of the social changes since WW2 are the chosen changing our collective morality to make our country more comfortable for them.

        Those prone to gloat over what’s going on may now perceive what many have perceived long ago. Israel is living on borrowed time and the world, for various reasons, will never long let the Jews live in peace. The lucky ones get to assimilate and vanish into their larger cultures.But this view underestimates the other ide of the coin. Israelis know this, at least the leadership does. Israel and its assets outside Israel possess the nuclear, chemical and biological means to ensure that the next holocaust will be the last. It’s not just Palestinians and their immediate allies who won’t survive and one has to respect them as they’re willing to give their lives to play their role. Air, water and radiation travels. Call it environmental globalization. And real threats, as opposed to empty ones, never get publicly mentioned.

            Israel will probably be better off making deals with Russia and China in the long run. The problem with their deal with Washington and the West is that it comes with the endless moralizing to the rest of the region. If Israel is no longer viewed as a soapbox on which Washington can preach to the Arab world, Israel may be able to find a peace with the Arab world.

It will shock the “I stand with Israel” crowd how quickly and completely they will switch their allegiances to China and Russia if those countries take the whip hand in the Middle East.  Not sure about the terms Russia and China would accept them on though.

                    I imagine China and Russia will have Israel to use its existent Fifth Column in the West to do dirty work for them; it already has for China at times (they have sold Beijing Naval technology stolen from the US) and likely has assisted Russia as well.

                Not too long ago I was questioning a friend who was wearing the dual/flag lapel pin. Now this friend is always going on about his real homeland and all they are achieving … … It was a bit audacious on my part, but I wanted to know how the mind works. When pressed on the question of if he cares more for America or Israel he said both. Thinking of a new tack, I asked him how it would work out for Israel if America continues to decay. He said, “By then we’ll be much stronger, much more powerful and we’ll be with China.” I got my answer when we did not include us and the real concern about which nation’s long term well being was important was clearly stated.So, the every day guy who reads their internal newspapers has probably been prompted by the power brokers and strategic thinkers that this is their long term plan.As for peace with the region I think that depends on the collective memory of the Middle East.

                The idea that a supposedly vulgar people (before any lurkers downvote, consider Larry David’s work) would pick up moralizing from the West is intriguing. What chimera might that produce? Clown World, maybe?

            Israel is largely a creation of the ‘British’ Empire, one of the remnants of which the US graciously assumed when it became GAE.
There sits the Pale of Settlement, emptied, theoretically a future independent Western Ukraine. Can’t shake the thought.
Point being, the Samson Option isn’t foregone.

            How about palestinians go to… their actual homes and land in palestine and ashkenazis go back to wandering about peddling junk door to door wherever they can manage to avoid being noticeably disruptive.
They’re just worse gypsies who have been allowed other people’s houses and since developed ideas far above their natural station.  They sorely need be disabused of these ideas.

        I have to say that this hollowing out of the GAE has been one of the most positive events of my lifetime. I can’t conceive of anything better than seeing Iran dictating peace terms to an emaciated Israel. That Semitic shitshow is not going to end well.

                    Not so sure about Britain.  Their ruling class would probably nuke themselves if Israel asked, assuming they could figure out a way to kill only White people.
