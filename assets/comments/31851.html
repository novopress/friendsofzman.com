            If they weren’t dating White Guys would the propaganda be necessary…I think they are still seeing White Couples and that enrages them to push 24/7 propaganda…

                    Good eye.  I wonder how long this will be permitted to continue.  They will be forced to change, like action movies and video games did.

        Mediocrity isn’t a bad deal. You don’t get the highs, sure, but you don’t get the lows, either. The trouble starts when you try to be something you aren’t.The bell curve is reality. Otoh, the bell curve also says the world needs more stable, competent, self-sufficient (if unspectacular) people than it needs great men or basket cases. There’s only so much extremity of living to go around.I’d guess the systems and managing thing is middle man leadership— bit of a contradiction in terms, probably can’t work in the long run. Not to say we need autocrats and serfs. That isn’t our thing, but somebody’s got to take the lead.I do think telling people they can have what they lack is good for business, but it’s probably just exploiting something that’s there to begin with. Maybe the idea of history as progress, an arrow pointing in one direction rather than a cycle, or merely this iteration. On a mission from God.Even destruction must be creative, but what if you win the game? What if it’s the End of History? Is that The End? Doesn’t seem like anybody thought that through. Seems like you double down so your world doesn’t fall apart, but it might anyway.The great and the small both know fate well. Middle man never gets the full draught, so I doubt he knows what he’s messing with.

        I don’t understand the way the term ‘manager’ is being used here. I thought in the Burnham theory ‘manager’ was an abstract term that could refer to anyone involved in managing the economy. For example the CEO of JPMorgan Jamie Dimon would be a ‘manager’ in this reading. But this analysis of managers as basically Ayn Rand villains who hate honest, successful, hard-working practical people applies more to actual managers. As in, the literal management of JPMorgan who hate Trump for being what they are not. What am I missing?

        Stellar show Z… However I will quibble with you over Trump later…What people like to forget about Trump is, his old man made him start at the bottom. Shoveling truck loads of stone and running a back hoe.Which had him working with the regular blue collar Joes.Trump is wealthier than 99% of Washington, and he became wealthy on his own. He doesn’t have to bend over to grift off the political donor class to have even the meager wealth they have. He’s never had to kiss anyone’s ass! They resent this.Trump is complete juxtaposition. He enjoys the bright shiny things and markers of status, but also enjoys his dirt people, simple pleasures like McDonalds and Chick Fillet.He also puts ketchup on his steak…Oh the freaking horror!All this enrages them, because it breaks down the elite facade that they are better than the dirt people.I disagree that Trump is merely a symptom. He is not just a bull in a China shop. He has real ideals that he believes in. If he had HIS WAY, a wall would have been built. He would have manufacturing brought back to the U.S. He immediately issued executive orders to stop illegal immigration. Yeah he still issued HB1’s, perfection is the enemy of progress. He got us into no new wars. He appointed 3, three so far conservative judges to SCOTUS. They over turned Roe, doesn’t matter where you stand on the issue. That is the biggest kick in the balls to the left and feminaziism you could ever hope to accomplish. It is a crushing blow to their psyche.Victory is won on the battlefield first and foremost by getting into the enemies heads. Trump did that and continues to do that.He accomplished all that with his own “team” his supposed allies fighting tooth and nail. against him. Non stop harassment from the deep state.Unrelenting hectoring from the media. Now they are trying to jail him and confiscate his wealth having committed ZERO crimes.1/4 of what Trump has faced would have had some of the greatest men in history biting a bullet.Trump belongs on Mt Rushmore just for that!

            People forget, but Trump hate is deep and long, longer than most people on earth have been alive.I was in NYC when he first became famous. “The media” always hated him. A great comedy magazine, Spy, hated him so much that the magazine became *about* hating him (and died of TDS).I first found out who he was when he wrote a letter to a literary magazine, either the Supplement or the NYRB, to complain that when he was reading book reviews his own name was so often gratuitously included in them as a metonym for evil—and in his letter he included a list of his favorite contemporary novels. It’s impossible to search for now, but I remember Nicholson Baker was included. They published it to demonstrate that he “doesn’t read”…because his judgments were so similar to critics’. Trump illiteracy has been a media meme for four decades.Based homo Bret Easton Ellis made the hero of American Psycho a Trump fan to show that his protagonist was crazy—that he misread everything around him and didn’t know how to fit in with society (the socialite kind). The idea of a white-collar aspirational-class guy loving Trump was prima facie INSANE…in 1991.Etc.This is why Trump was a hero to black guys. It wasn’t just that he was rich and vulgar. White people, the ones on TV, the only ones black people know, hated him.He *is* a heroic figure, maybe our only one.

            Funny that the first post this morning that I saw was yours YMAN.Last night, I started watching “Fallout”.The beginning grabbed me as it pulled no punches regarding a nuclear strike.I thought,”Hey, I can binge watch this whole damn season”.Was I in for a disappointment.Fast forward a few hundred years and the rich folk start alighting from their bunkers.They lost me at the moment the;Heroic knee grow who swiped an exoskeleton from a weak honkey,Reveals himself to a “strong female character”. They smile at each other and you know the white race is going to be diluted again. Paging inter species love story.And oh yeah, the bad guy is a white male mutant. The most entertaining character as far as I could tell.I so wanted to see how it turned out, but I’ve heard the message, seen the propaganda, and it’s just so lame and nauseating.

                I call it the (ahem) “Negrovision” because all they show on it is blacks on every channel.

                    In the world, not of it.It is possible to watch Negrovision.  What you make of it is what’s important.  No need to drag out details, but a lot of the problem lies in not understanding just what you are seeing.  As the above descriptions indicate, most commenters here are not fooled by the scenes of magic Negro’s in positions of prominence and dominance—they know it’s all make believe and subtle indoctrination.  Instead they take their enjoyment from other aspects of the show, while ignoring the rest.Reading and commenting in forums such as this is fine, but at my age, impossible for more than a few hours a day due to eye strain.  TV creates some useful breaks.

                    It’s all good brother, we all have our crosses to bare. .. 👍Even to get to all the good old non woke stuff, I cannot stand the constant onslaught of  overly tanned / mixed couples, LBGTQ, woke bullshit.I was trying to watch the movie Casino, you know a good old classic. A commercial came on and a discusting limp wristed , gay version of the 70’s song It’s Magic by the band pilot came on in some shit big pharma drug commercial.I was then reminded of the butchering of numerous classic rock greats used in commercials like Zepplin and The Who came to mind.I got instantly furious, and it runined my mood.If you can stand wading through the mud to get to something watchable, more power to you.

        You know what else?  I have a friend, a construction guy from backwoods Michigan.  He loves erecting big walls.  He read Art of the Deal and wanted to be Trump.You see, that’s Trump’s huge appeal.  He talks and acts like or normal joe; people can look at him and hear an echo of the old American Dream.  They could be a Trump too.  Maybe even have a glitzy casino or a ritzy girlfriend of their own some day.And, still bump into him at their local Chik-fil-a.  We don’t have to be weird or dirty to succeed in Trump’s America.

        And this is why the feminist media just can’t get enough of Trump.It’s like partner dancing; the guy spins her and twirls her, because partner dancing is about showing off the girl.  You don’t twirl the guy.So with Trump, the girlies can strut and preen, prattle and declaim; they’re always waiting for him to say something interesting and outrageous for salacious gossip.Biden or the drones?  Who cares?  Whatever the mainstream is going on about, it’s boring and pretentious, about as fun and sexy as being in church.  War, economy, courts, climate, covid- all just background scenery.Activists and street protests, like newsreaders, just want to play dress-up, do parties, and be seen on camera.  Everybody’s the star of To Kill A Mockingbird. looking towards the opening gala and awards dinner.It’s the tool guys who think laying a trench, erecting a bridge, riding a crane, sailing a boat, running a combine, tuning a dish- or even, honing their military kit- is kind of fun and cool.  That’s just big noisy stupid machines to the Panem girls.  There’s nothing to talk about!

        I agree with everything Z said. The one reservation I have about Trump is that he doesn’t seem like someone who can “drop character”. Like I feel he can’t be heartfelt or what not. Even Roosh, the notorious PUA guy (although to be fair he had given up the PUA lifestyle by that point) wrote a very nice eulogy about his sister (and somehow I can’t find it but it was on his blog).

        Fantastic description/encapsulation of the Trumpster, who he is and what he represents – especially to the tards in charge.  He is, flaws and all, a leader of men.
Another of the really good things about the special tards in charge (among many others) will be their absolute inability to take apart a firearm, clean it and put it back together so it actually works AND understand why that is important.  Their lack of basic technical skills will be their ultimate undoing…

        My favorite example of a German maker using a plastic part that should be metal is the infamous BMW, “Mickey Mouse flange,” that sits between the cylinder head and main coolant return hose:

Thankfully it is not difficult to replace, and the aluminum replacement part is not that expensive.

            Don’t get me going on plastic parts.  Seen any number of such fail and when/if replaced—at great time cost—are so obvious as to be excessive wear parts that would not cost a nickel to be made durable, I can only speculate this is done deliberately to get folk to buy replacement products.

                I used to drive a Volkswagen. At some point, the clip that holds the window in place inside the driver’s door just up and broke (upon investigation, it turned out to be made out of that very fragile, milky plastic that shrugs off all attempts to glue it). I enquired about getting a replacement clip and was told that Volkswagen didn’t sell the clips; instead, I would need to purchase an entire replacement door…

        Echoing many others: terrific show today.  Not because it was about Trump, but because of what Trump represents.I’m not a mechanic and don’t claim to be, but when my son and daughters were younger, I refused to fix things for them.  They were required to fix their own computers, for example.  My son built his own computer and helped his sister build hers.  When her computer failed, she came to me for help and I said “no” until she reached a point that was technically and financially beyond her.  Then I helped get the new hardware piece and she took over from there.  Her friend put an SUV into our ditch and busted the tire.  I made her friend pull it into the garage (it was snowing), put on the donut, and drive it to Discount Tire to get a new one.  I just pointed at things and where necessary demonstrated how to do it.  I used to randomly hand things to my son to figure out, like the battery-saver for the tractor.  “Just go figure it out.”“Just go figure it out” is lost on millions of people today.My oldest made the mistake of complaining that her boyfriend’s parents had helped her move (she lives in AZ and we live in CO).  I just laughed and said, “It’s not our job to help a grown woman move to a new apartment.”  That was 2 years ago and she hasn’t asked us for money since, including when her battery gave out in her car.  We’re now down to paying for things that benefit us, like flying her home for her sister’s graduation ceremony.  As parents, we benefit from this, and it gets her home, so we will kick in.Anyway, you covered a lot of ground, but the “fix it” part really resonated with me.I work around a lot of government people, especially military, but contractors, “civil servants”, etc.  They really do live in an alternate universe.  We are going to get our asses kicked in the next war.  Especially INITIALLY.  A lot of the worst troops will be killed.  If we win the next big war it’ll be the people who came in next to save the day.  I was at a memorial service for a retired military man who took his own life recently.  One of the Air Force officers was a woman about 5′ tall who was, I estimate, at least 200 pounds.  She was two people wide and butt ugly.  WTH is this person going to do of value in a conflict except run and hide while competent people fight?

        The problem with Trump is that he’s still a k*kesucker.  Even though they attack him relentlessly and call him Hitler, he’s still trapped in that Boomer truth regime.
Four years of looking into things and not pardoning dissidents and letting Israel enact their final solution isn’t all that appetizing.

                    Hardly a distinguishing feature at 60 Minutes. They let (some) goys do some reporting, but the producers, from Don Hewitt through to today, have almost without exception been jewish, looks like easily 80-90%. See for yourself. Even the ones whose early lives don’t explicitly say it, it’s curious that they are almost all from Brooklyn.

        Great podcast, Z.One aspect of this argument that really needs to be elaborated more is that Trump’s “testicular fortitude,” “git’ er done,” take-charge persona is an existential threat threat to the managerial/political class is because that class is so thoroughly feminized.It is females who emphasize credentials, knowing people, committees, and consensus over a step-up-to-the-plate-and-hit-a-home-run attitude. It is females who resent with intense fury being exposed as fraudulent, stupid, and incompetent.Let’s not forget who Trump defeated: the archetype of the brittle, fake, bitchy female manager whose claim to fame rested entirely upon her association with her husband. Could there be any person anywhere more uncomfortable and more unnatural talking to workers in a Chick-fil-A than Hillary? Could there possibly be a less natural leader and a less accomplished candidate? Is there anyone who has spent more time dissembling, blaming others, scheming, and deflecting criticism than Hillary? There is no Hillary Tower in Manhattan and she knew it and hated Trump for it with the intensity of a thousand suns.Yet it was a fait accompli that She would be installed as the First Woman President and all the Good People knew it… until Trump came along and laughingly urinated in her punch bowl.The hatred for Trump on the feminized Left, and the devotion to him on the working-class Right, is an extension of this writ large across the country. No-bullshit guys who operate backhoes and drive trucks and get things done instinctively fall behind Trump as a natural leader, while the feminized, credentialized managerial class of female politicians, female professors, female lawyers, and female media types were terrified that when he exposed Hillary as fake and incompetent, he would by extension expose all of them as fake and incompetent as well, and they were so threatened they went berserk, literally donning pussy hats and screaming in the streets like children.Trump was a reminder that everything of value in this country was created by white men, and the “equality” of women is entirely dependent upon browbeating men with tantrums and histrionics until they concede a share of the wealth and power.

            Excellent comment, couldn’t agree more, Xman, would just like to add that it is women who gossip and badmouth you, and what is CNN and MSNBC and the rest but a gossip machine? The media outlets put a feminized lens to bear on Trump, hoping to shame him into submission in the female way, and when Trump shrugged them off like Atlas they had a tantrum. For instance, they would not show the vast crowds at his rallies, keeping the camera on him as if it was him and a few kooks there. In their bitchy bitterness they attempted to sabotage him, failing in the end.Never trust a pussy to do a man’s job, and never trust the media to tell it straight.— Xloveli (dark.sport.blog)

        I loved this podcast.  It summed things up perfectly.  I loved Trump for a long time.  Couldn’t see his flaws (would not, in fact) because the effect he was having on the worst people in the world was just too much fun (“I promise not to do this to Greenland!”, etc.)  He was so out of place amongst the Skeksis in DC.  The people who made him necessary were forced to expose themselves.  Supporting him felt subversive and rebellious; the waves of goodwill between normal, decent people made the times feel like days of old in some odd way.I’ll never forget the outpouring of support for him before the 2020 election.  Flotillas, convoys, Amish buggies carrying Trump flags, dozens of Vietnamese ladies in matching red white and blue lining a road in Florida, tens of thousands of MAGA hats at rallies, and on and on and on.  I’ve never seen anything like that in my lifetime.  That wasn’t normal.The disenchantment set in fully after J6 and the pardons list, and for a long while I wished he would just go away.  But he’s become something else, now.  He’s not just a man any more – he’s a symbol.   He stands for something – defiantly.I’m under no illusions about him, either.  But when a person takes that much punishment and just keeps getting up again, well.  It takes on a life of its own.

            Trump’s sheer indefatigabilty and calmness in the face of endless lawfare are what make me believe he is genuine, though highly flawed.

                What exactly are these “flaws” everyone is always going on about?He’s cocky? Brash? Bold? Because he tells people who fuck with him to fuck off? Because he takes no shit? These are not flaws. He wouldn’t be Trump or had the impact he’s had on the left, the swamp whatever without those traits. It’s always “I like Trump but flaws.”I like MAGA but not Trump because “flaws,”Give it a fucking rest.He’s been proven to be an honest businessman. Ten years of going through his business career with a fine tooth comb and… Nothing!So he’s a successful player with women. So freakin what? So were JFK / RFK. So was bubba Clinton. Almost every male politician has skeletons  in his closet.I think men who don’t like Trump because “flaws”are nothing more than envious beta’s.

                        Exactly.  Trump has a CEO mindset—my way or the highway!  He was a political novice tossed into the snake pit of politics.  He did not have the power to *fire* of his political adversaries and lacked the political knowledge to pick and choose the appropriate allies (staff), some of whom were backstabbing him, while looking to their own political fortune—not his.This was ironically his greatest flaw, while also his greatest strength (outsider).  None of this should surprise *anyone* who remember Schwarzenegger and Ventura—both of whom reached the pinnacle of their State’s power structure without real party support and both of whom failed to make any lasting changes to the Uniparty.

                    Trumps “flaw” is the fact that he doesn’t seem to understand the spirit that got him elected in the first place and that he constantly acts against the interests of the people who support him, and even against his own.
Witness forgiving Hillary Clinton, appointing a bunch of neocons to his cabinet, assassinating Soleimani, not firing Fauci, operation Warp Speed, Jan. 6th…
And now there is an article up on Zero Hedge saying that Trump wants to provide loans to assist Ukraine. What the actual?

        A good show, Z. And for me, captures why – even though he is not aligned with my politics – I enjoyed his tenure as Prez.Indeed, he does seem to just like being rich. He does seem to not give a hare’s hind leg about being seen as a manager. And, in his vulgar mannerisms, he reveals the managers contempt not just him himself, but for us also.As I say, I’m under no illusions about Trump, but some of the things he did were moments of jaw-dropping honesty (recall, he frequently would point at CNN journalists and say “You are fake news!”).You got another thing right: heisa brave man.

        A Journey through mid-America.I wasn’t going to start this but there’s enough overlap between Z’s podcast and my observations that yes I will go ahead and cover some highlights of our trip to see the total eclipse. And I know I’ll get ridicule for driving hundreds of miles to see it. I also have to say that the total eclipse itself was disappointing. We saw the one in 2017 near where we live. The thing I discovered is once you’ve seen one total eclipse, you’ve seen them all. It’s like your first kiss. The bloom is definitely off the rose. But the trip itself was actually worth it.I’ll try to be as brief as possible. We left the Denver area on Saturday trying to make Topeka by nightfall. But then they closed the highway in western Kansas because of a dust storm with 45 mph gusts. You couldn’t see twenty feet it was so bad. It took three hours to clear the highway of all the accidents. We were at a truck stop so we went into the IHOP for lunch. I havent’ been in an IHOP in decades. The only thing different is IHOP’s don’t feature pancakes on the menu anymore. When we finally left we made good time and got to Topeka around 11pm.The next day we went to the Nelson-Atkins art museum in Kansas City. I’ve taken up oil painting in recent years so that’s why I’m interested in seeing the best and this is one of the top museums in the country. And it’s free admission. We spent about an hour and a half there and then headed for St. Louis.Before we got back on I-70 we pulled into a McDonald’s. The wife said let’s go in. I said under no circumstances. She asked why and I said don’t you see what’s going on? She hadn’t. First of all there was a meth-head loitering around the entrance to the drive-through. He was the only white person around. When I pulled up to order, a deep snarly black voice said “Whuchu wont?” I placed the order and he called it back. I thought he said 3 Big Macs instead of one. I decided to let that go for the time being. At the pay window the girl called out the order again and I said ‘And a bottle of water.’ She nodded sullenly. At the pickup window a large hostile looking black man — perhaps the one who took the order — handed me the bag. As I checked the bag, he snapped his head around at me so I slowly crept forward. The meth-head had by this time migrated around to the pickup window. Beyond him out on the street a prostitute was pacing up and down the sidewalk. She wasn’t wearing any clothing to speak of except a gauzy thing that was flipping around in the breeze. Under the overpass was another druggie mooning the cars. He was going through some violent contortions as well that it’s impossible to describe. As we drove onto the highway, I gave the wife a lecture on why you always need to be observant of your surroundings in a city you don’t know. We drove east to Independence, MO before stopping to eat our meal. Then we drove on to St. Louis.We got up well before sun-up the next day and headed south from St. Louis on I-55 for Sikeston, MO. We stopped around sunrise in Cape Girardeau, which is about 30 miles north of Sikeston. Cape G is the boyhood home of Rush Limbaugh. The plates in the parking lot were from everywhere. I could see it was going to be a clear day for the eclipse even though there was heavy fog that morning. I wanted to go down to see the river but there was a solid bank of fog through the opening in the seawall so we didn’t get out of the car. Going back up the hill through downtown Cape G, I saw something that made me laugh, thinking of one of Z’s favorite lines. Striding angrily out of the fog came a bearded man wearing a bright green sundress. Or maybe it wasn’t a sundress, maybe it was an evening gown. I don’t know. I figured he was probably headed for the local library. This sh*t is everywhere, even in Rush Limbaugh country.We stopped at another IHOP for breakfast. Run by an Indian couple. The waiter said he had moved here from Ft. Lauderdale, FL several years back and everyone is friendly here. I found this to be true. Culturally, this area is part of the South. As he took our dishes, the waiter kind of complained  that I didn’t eat my pancakes. I laughed and said, Yeah, and this is the International House of Pancakes. He didn’t think that was funny. We went on to Sikeston and checked into the hotel. The lady at the desk said everyone was gathering at the rec center at the park. She looked a lot like Sarah Palin.We went to the park which consists of a main building next to a 6 or 7 acre lake. Beside the park is an airfield.  They were setting up tables and giving out freebies such as eclipse-viewing glasses.We met a couple who drove over from west Tennessee. I could tell within 5 minutes I wasn’t going to get on with this guy. I love the South and the Southern people. Heck, I’m one of them. But there’s this thing in the South where some people have a way of laying a guilt trip on you that you might not even notice it’s so subtle. That waiter at the restaurant is an example. So anyway, by this time the wife had made friends with some people sitting at some picnic tables under a pavilion. So I was hauling the ice chest over to the pavilion and I told the guy that’s where we would be sitting and he said Alright. Just in that one word by the way he said it he was guilting me. Imagine saying Alright with a long drawn-out sigh. This was a pattern because he had a few minutes before pulled this stunt over something else. I figured him for the chair of his county Republican committee. Also, his wife said they were season ticket holders to the theater in Memphis and they had recently seen the musical ‘Wicked’ so that spelled it for me.I fell into conversation with another man at the pavilion. He was a local and had just recently sold his business. I don’t want to give too much away but I’ll say a few things. He was there with his wife and three daughters and their husbands and all their grandkids. We talked about all kinds of things. He said that the airfield was from WWII for pilot training. He said this land used to be nothing but farmland and that it was all underwater when the river flooded. He told me about the topography of all this land hereabouts from the hills to the flatlands. He said the locals called Cape Girardeau, Cape Ji-RAR-duh, or Ji-RAH-duh (I wasn’t sure which.) Only outsiders say Cape Ji-rar-DO. He said he had driven every gravel road in the Mississippi Delta and he named all the towns. I told him about the Red Dog mine in Alaska, and the haul road going out to the Arctic ocean. We commiserated over the early demise of Rush. Then he said something that struck me.It was about a business decision he had had to make. He said he had had to turn down the contract because his employees were backing away from it when they found out how long they’d be away from home. And that’s the difference between a big corporation and a small business. I remember my father operated the same way. The interests of the owner and employees have to line up or it doesn’t work.So I walked around the lake three times and sat around. At one point I could swear a restored C47 took off from the airfield. I’m not really much on aviation so I can’t be sure but I think that’s what it was. At another point I saw something high up glittering and flickering moving across the sky. I texted my son about it and he replied They’re out there Dad. But I figured it was probably just a stray Chinese weather balloon. Another thing I saw not just at the park but at rest areas along the way is that no one knows how to throw a football anymore in terms of technique. Or maybe they never did. But there was one father and son who could throw the football like nobody’s business. They just had natural talent. They didn’t need technique.Finally, we had the eclipse. The birds started to roost and the streetlights came on. The wife nearly keeled over backward and I ran up and grabbed her just in time. As I said, the eclipse was a bit of an anticlimax.We headed back to St. Louis the next day and stopped at the St. Louis museum of art. Another freebie. They asked us if we wanted tickets for the Matisse exhibit but I said no, let’s just walk around. They had a couple of portraits by Zorn that I admired. Then at one point I was looking at this wall-size painting by Gainsborough when this fat girl ran up to me saying Sir, Sir, I saw you, I saw you pointing. You were over the line pointing. I have found that the best policy in situations like this is to be as noncommital as possible. So I just grunted at her. Then it was as if she had vanished into thin air. I got a little hot under the collar and was looking all around so I could tell her off. For one thing, just after she scurried off, there was this Latino woman who was practically crawling up another wall-size painting. She definitely left her DNA on that painting. Well, it’s been said before on this comment section but you kinda get the feeling that you’re marked if you’re a white man. But I couldn’t find that girl, she was nowhere to be found. My wife told me it’s not worth it so we left. We got back on the road and stayed at Independence, MO for the night. Oh, and another thing you notice at art museums is that almost all the people — visitors and staff alike — are mutants.When we were driving across Missouri I saw a billboard that asked the question, Are you Having Trouble with Buzzards on your Farm? And darned if I hadn’t seen a lot of buzzards flying around. I said to the wife, I didn’t know buzzards caused property damage on farms. She said, oh yes, she saw on the news where this one farm was plagued with buzzards somewhere in Colorado to the point where they had gone through all the rubber hoses and stuff. Colorado outlawed billboards years ago. There are pros and cons to that. I can see both sides. There was this one guy between Fountain Creek and Pueblo on I-25 who lost a lot of income because of it. Finally, he started putting up a lot of anti-government messages on his billboards and then finally he died and the billboards came down.We had an argument over whether we should stop at the Arabia Steamboat museum in Kansas City. I wanted to keep going but she was pretty insistent on it. The problem was her friend had raved about it, so she had to see it too. She didn’t say that in so many words but that was the problem. So we stopped. It was interesting. A team of amateurs dug it up out of a cornfield. It was buried 40 feet down. The river had changed course which is why it was in a cornfield. They recovered hundreds of artifacts from the 1840s while bound upriver to supply the needs of the pioneer families. We got into a conversation with a son of one of the men who did the recovery. I asked him how they made a business out of it. He said it was strictly ticket sales. He said the city of Kansas City had made them a sweet deal to occupy their building which is an old warehouse in the bad part of old St. Louis which at that time was controlled by the Pendergast machine so the city wanted to revitalize the area. I made a comment about Harry Truman but he didn’t get the reference. Anyway, the museum’s lease was up in two years so they had to move because it would cost a fortune to stay there. He said they had their sights on doing another recovery of another earlier steamboat wreck that was loaded with supplies for the indians and fur trappers and they wanted to do a national steamboat museum.So we had to extend our car rental an extra day. We made Salina that night. But before Salina, we stopped at the Kansas state capitol building in Topeka because why not, we’d already lost that day. At the security desk I told the security guy I had a knife but he said just keep it in my pocket. That place is another one of these structures that they couldn’t build today at any cost. I would recommend it. We saw the senate and house chambers. In the rotunda are a lot of impressive murals. There’s one that’s famous of John Brown with a twister in the background and him holding a bible in one hand and a rifle in the other. It reminded me of when my father would want to cuss about something but he would say ‘I’ll be John Brown!’ instead of “I’ll be g-d!” As I mentioned, I’m Southern.The next day was uneventful driving back across Kansas and eastern Colorado. I apologize for the length of this post.

            Great show ZMan!  But I’ll go off topic, too.About the mural of John Brown by John Stewart Curry in the Kansas Capitol.  I saw it many times as a kid growing up in Topeka and a favorite outing with my grandmother was to walk all the way up to the top of the dome observing all the iron work inside and then stepping out on the balcony at the top.  That image of John Brown —at the center of a huge mural The Tragic Prelude memorializing Bloody Kansas before the Civil War — his face and beard, were as familiar to me as any face in my family. At age twenty I was in the Navy stationed in Naples and took my first trip to Rome and St. Peter’s was my main objective. Overall, it was overwhelming, but my attention was drawn to the statuary at ground level on the right side of the nave. First, the incredibly beautiful and moving Pieta’ and a bit further along Michelangelo’s Moses.   Of course it was familiar from a photo in Encyclopedia Britannica, but head on old Moses was the spitting image of John Brown.Decades later spending time on the modern equivalent of reading the encyclopedia for hours I stumbled on the biography of the Kansas painter and read that he had traveled to Rome as a young man and sketched the statue of Moses and that sketch became the face of John Brown. On top of that I learned I was related to him and he is buried in the small sectarian church yard where some of my aunts and uncles are buried.John Brown was a hero for his abolitionism to the locals in Topeka and other New England settled towns here.  I on the other hand was always a dissident and to this day Robert E. Lee is my favorite Civil War era bearded figure and his image, not Moses or John Brown, shares wall space in my home with the icon of Christ Pantocrator.Any of you Z people coming through on I-70, I wish I could know and buy you dinner. God bless

                    Local boys that used a local emblem. Used to go see them under their original name at a club in the next county.  Age15-16 with a fake ID.  Most working class kids then worked after school and weekends and bought old cars that we worked on with friends. We also drank too much.  If you were pulled over for driving drunk the cops might just chew you out and follow you home. Unlike our host, I was an underachiever— no guidance.On the topic of young people working which came up in the comments: back then in the 70s  one of my jobs, and I usually had two,  was working in a cafeteria alongside adults and other high school students. Many of the adults were former residents of the state mental hospital and among the other kids were two friends of mine whose fathers were psychiatrists at the then nationally renowned Menninger Clinic.  Really, it was remarkable that a child of mental patients worked with and mixed socially with kids who would go off to the Ivies  I and my other friends went to the military or factory at 17.   We taught them how to change ( or a least check) their oil and they taught us which fork to use!   What I didn’t learn from them was that I could go to college. I really couldn’t see beyond earning enough to eat, have a roof over my head, a way to get around, and beer to drink on the weekends.I was not exactly headed for seminary at that age

                        Reading your story reminds me a bit of mine.  What I particularly note is that we had *nothing* and therefore it was completely assumed in your very DNA that if you wanted something, you went to work to obtain it.  The mis-spent youth stuff to me is not the essential part of your story.  Did that as well.  That you learned to work for your “daily bread” is.
My conclusion is that “good times”—wealth has destroyed America’s soul and several generations later we are reaping the whirlwind.

        Great show!Trump is like a middle clas guy who happens to be a billionare.The clouds disdain for the middle class may be their undoing. The middle class aka dirts, keep the system running. Part of Rome’s collapse was a lack of maintenance. We have been foolish to allow the infrastructure to degrade in order to pay for social progams.The destruction of the middle class may be the end of the modern complex society. Casual dismisal of what you can not do is a common theme in the modern beauracracy. The leadership lacks the ability to cut their own grass. That’s “funny/scary”.Hope you all have a good weekend.

            I just read something yesterday about a new car being unaffordable for 82% of the American population. Even cheap cars. There was nothing more quintessentially American then owning a house in the suburbs and a new car yet it is out of reach for the vast majority. Assuming this stat is for real, that shows how far we’ve fallen..

                It’s probably real.  Unless you are getting a bought down loan, You’re in the bag for 7% interest these days.  However, when I was younger, that was typical for used cars, with new being slightly less and a longer term loan.What happened?  In those days you bought a new car for $10k give or take for a working class person.  Last I walked down the showroom, the cheapest new car (which I bought) was $51k MSRP.Money really isn’t more expensive today compared with historical times.  It’s just that in the last decade or two, we’ve begun to think 2% interest is the norm, which covered up all those price increases, like in housing and cars.

        One of the things that the managerial elite has not considered is frustrated ambition. Regular black folk like Trump because he represents to them, the ability to make more money in their lives. Making more money makes life a LOT easier when you are on the margins and black voters while they may not vote for Trump seemed poised to stay at home. Latinos, likely will mostly vote for Trump.And young White men, they are going to be Trump in the extreme. I think it was Instapundit that noted the other day that only 15% of Stanford’s new class is White, and of that only 9% White Males. [And 100% of that 9% is ((()))].Ambition denied creates incentives. Charlie Munger (the late side man to Buffett) noted that incentives drive human behavior in ways that surprised even him. The Managerial Class has built every incentive of Young White men to destroy the system so they can advance. There is literally no way for them to advance within the system.What happens AFTER Trump? To young White men seeking advance. To non-White people wanting more money? Where do they go and what do they do? There is no other figure than Trump and the Managerial Elite comfort themselves that after Trump one way or another, there will be no challenge.

            Short answer is that smart white guys will stop trying to climb the corporate/political ladder and they will instead get back to tinkering and building things in their garage.  This is how aviation, electronics quite a lot else got started.  Obviously not every white dude can become a Wright Brother or one of the Hewlett-Packard duo but you get the point.  Cleverness and self reliance and trying new things…this is the way.

        One small quibble with the incapacity of the managerial class to DO anything useful. A distinction ought to drawn between ignorance of a skill and unwillingness to use it. I’ll just use your lawn mowing anecdote as the illustrative example. First, I’ll credit that some simply lack knowledge of how the mower operates or even how to start it. Maybe that’s generational, like your intern and using a screwdriver. I’ve got nephews who were never required to do chores as children. This didn’t just arrest their moral development, but left them void of certain tool-using skills. They’re not stupid, since they readily mastered computers and musical instruments. They just weren’t taught or directed by their parents, who also shielded them from the influence of other willing mentors, including me.On the other hand, I mowed my fair share of lawns as a teen. Our’s, as an assigned chore, under the watchful tutelage of my father. And neighbors’, to make a little pocket money. But I don’t mow my lawn today or for the past twenty years. At first this was a matter of choosing to spend my time in a more rewarding way, either working on more profitable projects (bill $200 an hour versus pay $25 to gardener) or to relax after an entire week of just such stressful (if not laborious) work.I agree entirely that a man should know how to do a host of similar problem-solving tasks; but sometimes the wiser course of action is to pay someone else and thus free up that time. YMMV

            Maus:  This.  My husband did a variety of manual labor and business jobs in his teens and early 20s.  Not learned from his dad (a career army officer) but from his best friend-like-a-brother whose more country family socially ‘adopted’ him as one of their own all the time he spent with them.  This dual nature/nurture definitely set him apart from most other government weenies.Now – he’s older, and he’d rather pay someone to do these things (especially as everything has become more complex) while he continues his work which pays a lot more.  I do sometimes wish he was a bit more ‘handy’ around the house, but he’s just not that interested in manual crafts in the limited free time he has.

            I’ve adopted the mentality that I don’t need to know how to do everything, but I ought to know if it is being done properly.  A lot of what people call DIY today is actually something better done by a craftsman.  Laying tile, for example.I’ve put down tile, but I never realized how badly a job I was doing until I hired a true tile guy to install floor tile in our master bedroom.  He was a craftsman.  He didn’t just know how to lay tile, he did the subfloor right and had ways of lining up the tile perfectly.It’s not so much that I’ll pay to have it done rather than do it myself.  It’s that I’m now wise enough and financially well-off enough to appreciate things being done RIGHT.  I’ll gladly pay a craftsman to do it right…and still get it done in 1/4 of the time it would have taken me.But I do cut my own grass (couple acres, love riding the tractor)…

                You are right about the merits of craftsmanship versus learn-by-one’s-own-errors DIY but the problem these days is finding the craftsman.  They’re all retiring or unavailable.

                    Call a strong real estate agent.  The list of trades we have is based on the list of contractors she hires to fix things in sellers’ homes.  Since she did high quality work, we discovered her contractors also did.  (And they’re mostly younger.) Our home builder also left us a list.
The guys who did our mill work are amazing.  That’s another one I “can” do myself, but I’ll pay to have a craftsman do right.

        It would be an interesting poll to see if Europeans and Americans would feel safer or less safe with Trump in office.After watching the events under Biden starting with Afghanistan debacle and now the US State Department openly supporting Hamas, another four years of this decrepit imbecile in the White House can only endanger Europeans, and Americans even more.European leadership and the combined efforts of our respective militaries under NATO will do nothing to make us any safer. More tanks, cannons and jet fighters are pointless since European military personnel readiness and effectiveness is nearly zero with basically zero confidence in the men and women under arms who are supposed to “protect” Western Europe.The average German on the street has no fear of Russia becoming the old Soviet Union one day and heading west. No one is having fanciful delusions of Russian tanks once again rolling through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.Our greatest fear is exactly what Americans are experiencing first hand; out of control immigrants committing crimes against the civilian population in their towns and cities and local governments unable or unwilling to put a stop to it.

        Trump the BarbarianPeople have had it with Dementia Joe and hence Trump will get a huge vote this November if not assassinated first. This means that the cheating required to steal the election will be epic and obvious. The new Covid con won’t mask this and nobody listens to the MSM anymore, so selling the Lie won’t fly this time. What comes next?Genuine efforts toward soft secession will begin, largely at the southern border. DC won’t try a Federal interdiction because the Texas National Guard would kick their ass and half the US military would applaud. So that leaves Shooting The Moon, Go For Broke extremism. National debt will skyrocket and BRICS will kill the dollar, double digit inflation will finally get normie off the couch. Mass protests, rioting, and pleb-on-pleb mayhem is a certainty. Biden’s corpse will order a crackdown and then things will get interesting. Great Fun for all!

            I don’t think Biden will have to surpass 81 million votes to win. Trump could add 6 million votes to his total from last time and still fall short. So the cheating does not have to be any greater, or any more or less obvious. Just a repeat will do.My only question is if the foot soldiers of fortification are still loyal to Biden, or have become disaffected due to dead PalestiniansIf Trump does somehow manage to win, it will only be to become the new Herbert Hoover, blamed for the big crash, which would discredit the “maga” movement for good

        Some of this podcast sounds like what I wrote yesterday that didn’t get a lot of upvotes and at one point got a ton of downvotes. You hit the same things I said about politicians being actors, but only from the side of their donors telling them what to do and how to vote. The administrative state is just as much at fault for our situation as donors are and controls just as many of those puppet strings. There is even symbiosis between the two, as Soros was supposedly a frequent visitor to the State Department back in the old days.(Repeating again: Ukrainian Minister of Defense Aleksandar Vindman said Trump should be impeached because he ignored the “interagency consensus.” I called him the Ukro-Khazarian Minister of Defense yesterday, but I’m being nice today.)The disconnect between people who shuffle papers and make decisions and the people who actually do things explains why the Smart set always fall for these scams like global warming, green energy, the sexual revolution, kumbaya immigration, etc. They just don’t know how the pieces of society fit together because they don’t work in a world where they have to make practical things work. They think they can create their magical world just by sending a few emails out and waving their magic wand.This is the biggest problem with the world we have today. The so-called creative class just doesn’t know how things really happen. It always has been that way, probably, but these people didn’t have as much power over society as they do now in the past.

        This was an outstanding show. This adds a dimension for how to think about and understand Trump and the reaction to him. What is remarkable is how the NPC class of The Regime mimics the power-player Managers in The Regime. A hive of drones.I’ve seen video footage of Eyepatch Dan being hounded by some independent journalist guy putting the screws to him. It was one where Eyepatch Dan eventually pushes and walks over someone in the crew and then gets a huge smile on his face. More interesting is the entourage of staffers that he kept around him. They were all smoking hot Asian women with porn hair, nails, heels, lashes and wearing tens of thousands of dollars head to toe. At some point, just like the footage of over the table butt sex in the Congress leaked, look for footage of Eyepatch Dan banging his staff of Asian hookers, (Chinese honey-traps? Tel Aviv honey-traps? Indian honey-traps? Mexican honey-traps? One of each?), to emerge.Eyepatch did get through SEAL training. Even if the standards are lower that is no small feat. That said, if he represents what remains of our best men we are finished.I have a new appreciation for Trump after this podcast. He is doing something Messianic even if he isn’t our guy. He is to be commended for standing up to and taking on pure evil. For that, he is a legitimately heroic character.

            Nice comment.  I remember being quite impressed with Crenshaw initially (was I ever that young) until he came out in favour of Red Flag Laws.  Some time after that he took to Twitter to defend his position, and the sh*tstorm in the replies really was one for the ages.  Actually, I think that might have been where the sobriquet ‘Eyepatch McCain’ was born.Widespread disenchantment with that scumbag appears to have taken root, because he’s a phoney reptilian shapeshifter and far from the only one.“And thus I clothe my naked villainyWith odd old ends stol’n out of holy writ;And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.”Richard IIIVery few authentic people survive the selection process.  It’s just a closed circle full of degenerates  who’ve seen each other in leather bikinis basically.

                Eyepatch McCain totally bamboozled the local hicks including myself.  He was heavily promoted on talk radio by a local host as one of the good guys running to oust a rino.  This was 2014 I think before Trump opened our eyes.  There’s a good guy Jameson running as an independent against him.  This is a 70% repub district but Mr Eyepatch is unlikely to be moved.

                    Sorry to hear it.  Although many people are seeing the light, folk tend to go for ‘known quantities’ once the bait is taken.  When I first became aware of him, the thought ‘Hmm, Presidential material?’ went through my head.  It’s now an Iron Law that when this happens, that person always turns out to be even worse than the usual worm in the end.  They know exactly what they’re doing.
Who knows, he might get a fright next time!

            I met Crenshaw when he was first starting out, before he was elected.  Small private reception (Long story which I must withhold in the interest of web anonymity…TLDR it was a fundraiser and I was one of the poor people in the room).  We spoke briefly at the bar and I will say he was a legitimately very nice dude.  Of course, maybe he thought I had money and was a potential campaign donor.  Anyways he did not seem to have a whole lot of opinions of his own.  This is understandable: he was in the Navy and then medical rehab, not grad school.  But I recall him saying verbatim “I’ve been listening to Ben Shapiro and I learn a lot  from him.”  Well I didn’t think much of it at the time but I’m sure he went deeper and deeper into (((Conservatism, Inc.))) and let those people form him and look at what he’s become.  Sad.

        And right on cue, some cultural / media clown named Seth Meyers is rolled out to fire on TrumpMs Chick-fil-A stop:— He for sure didn’t pay for those milkshakes and the chicken;— He doesn’t know how to talk regular folk;I confess I have no idea who this guy Meyers is. I checked out of the media / cultural circus about two-plus decades back. But his comments seem especially ironic coming from a guy who likely never leaves the impregnable bubble of weirdness and fantasy that covers NYC, or whatever cultural madhouse he inhabits.I imagine he has been selected for his role due to his ability to connect with similarly wired urban sophisticates, and cannot see beyond the limits of their delusional, solipsistic worldview.Another jarring irony —Trump being tried for classified document mishandling, when President and the absolute and final classification authority;Hillary and Bill show up at the White House as select guests for the state dinner with Japanese prime minister — looking ever so relaxed and even jovial in the publicity shot released. Not a worry over her real and massive violation of document security law, regulation and practice.Who are the favored people, and donthey just love rubbing our faces in it?

                        The “plasticity” is part and parcel of their mental illness.  The more absurd and obvious the plastic surgery, the more they like it and want.  There are Reddit groups that post pictures of such “bimbo” histories.  That Bezos finds attraction in this is also telling.  All of this is sad.  But mental illness is sad and part of the human condition.

            Seth Meyers was on SNL, and is the host of the later late night NBC show taking over Conan O’Brien’s old spot.
He is famous for during the Gridiron Dinner (Press and DC pols) constantly making jokes at Trumps expense after Trump had questioned Obama’s birth certificate. Prior to that Trump had been in the club and it was likely at that moment Trump decided to run. Absent Seth Meyers doing a brutal take down of Trump, you’d have looked at Hillary! beating Jeb!

                Under Obama the presidential roast couldn’t be about making fun of the president anymore. Trump was repeatedly picked out and mocked as the safest target (biggest loser) in the room, not only by Meyer. I don’t think Trump can consciously understand events that are so contrary to his self-image, but he felt it.

        Off topic:  Get away from cities and suburbs and stop paying the diversity tax, in social researcher speak:   “Revealed preference indicates that Westerners dislike actually-existing immigration so much that they are willing to take large pay cuts to escape it. In immigration-heavy countries, people move away from economic opportunity!  . . . Here, local emigration is driven by newcomers’ behavior. In the United States, this is often called white flight, but it is not limited to white people or America.  The exodus is often motivated by concerns about crime and physical safety, but it doesn’t have to be. Political differences, cultural differences, disagreements about appropriate use of public space (such as littering or noise levels), or simple dissatisfaction with minority status can all cause locals to leave in spite of the economic incentives. For instance, even West Coast Asians, who are wealthy and commit very little crime, drive white flight by greatly increasing5 the grind associated with education (Enjeti, 2017).”https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/fleeing-opportunity

            3g,Who knew!Imagine preferringsomethingrelated to your roots and race over “economic opportunity”!It’s almost like it is just a natural thing to do. I should imagine that the only people impacted by this “study” are GoodWhites, who will be – naturally -appalled. Of course, whilst blacks may be “hurt” or “offended”, at least they don’t deny it’s all about race.Yesterday, as I rocked my youngest to sleep, I listened to some guy referred to as ‘Sargon’ interview Mr. Jared Taylor. Even though ‘Sargon’ appeared to be some sort of rightist, he kept trying to get Mr. Taylor to admit it’s not all about race. Unfortunately for this fellow, it is.My prayers to You and Yours. Glory to Him in the Highest.

                OrangeFrog: Blessings to you and all your family. Rocking babies to sleep is a treasured memory.   I have never listened to Sargon but I have heard him mentioned by others – he is apparently Carl Benjamin.  I thought he was half subcon but doesn’t appear so in photos.  Perhaps he’s married to one?  I don’t know – but there is almost always something like that in the background when someone claiming to be a dissident claims race isn’t primary.It’s not just blacks, or just any ‘x.’  On an individual basis one may meet decent individuals of any race.  But custom, habit, morality, etc. is all heavily dependent on genetics, and conflict naturally arises when these differences come to the fore due to close contact.  Yet another reason I love living in an extremely rural and overwhelmingly White area.

                    Sargon’s wife is “black” but he’s British so I don’t know exactly what that means. He’s a normal 20th century white conservative, libertarian with traditionalist sensibilities that he sometimes resists, treats idealogical/religious divisions as more real than physical ones (because the former are alterable, in theory), etc. Good guy by instinct, but the time of the good guy has passed.

            You’re never going to get perfection. He’s as close to being my guy as it gets.
The thing about Trump is that you never know where he’s coming from. You can read into his proclamations whatever you want sometimes because I suspect sometimes he just says things but you’re supposed to know he really thinks the opposite.
I’m hoping that’s what’s going on when he keeps professing his love for Israel.

Don’t hand me a turd sandwich and tell me that I shouldn’t expect perfection.
The right wing refusal to learn and the obsession with giving him a second attempt has me writing off what remains of this society.  Too stupid to survive.
His second term will be another total disaster and you fools voting for Trump a second time deserve everything you will get.

It got you nowhere.Trump betrayed his supporters not only by refusing to do anything about immigration, but also left the J6ers to rot in prison while pardoning rappers.Yet, you still believe he is secretly something else than his words and actions have clearly demonstrated.Why the learning disability?

I get no satisfaction at all.
They are winning, I don’t give a damn about their anger.
You are like some institutionalized patient laughing as the wards who hate their jobs beat you senseless.
Then later you decide to repeat the same useless thing that make your captors angry so you can once again gain some perverse, disordered pleasure while not improving your own position.
What a hopeless clownshow the right is

                    Are you kidding? Look at how far the Overton window has moved on all of these issues because of Trump’s loud mouth and because of how things are framed. All of these people you see in public positions, from Leticia James to the prosecutor in the federal case, to Fauci, to Miley have done something and that’s why they are being put out there until that the spotlight shines on them.Everything is being put out there so that we can see it. We wouldn’t have been able to see it before. All of this stuff, from election fraud to everything else, would have been done under the cover of darkness..

        In my opinion this is probably the magnum opus of your blogging career, Z. I often get egged by the Dissidents for being overly optimistic about the future and maybe rightfully so. People don’t understand that I am thinking in the long term. I am looking at least one generation, possibly two – down the road. All empires rise and fall, and we are at least two generations into the fall of the American Empire. Most of us here will probably live to see it collapse. But after that, there WILL be redemption.One of the fatal flaws I see in Dissident thought that worries me is the attitude toward our kids. “They’re stupid, they’re lazy, they have no idea how things work…”. Let us hold that mirror of yours up to ourselves: whose fault is that?  Are we so lazy and short sighted ourselves, that we will write off an entire generation? Again – the reason our sons are faggots and incels living in the basement is because WE allowed obvious crazies and disturbed women bring it about without so much as a complaint. I saw this in my own family – I was accused of being unsuportive of my kid when I insisted that she get good marks in school, keep her nose clean, and learn to be helpful and useful. It got me cancelled and shoved out the airlock eventually and to be truthful… after much heart ache and soul searching and self doubt… I have managed to become oddly proud of it.You did well in teaching that kid how to un-jam the paper copier. These kids are not worthless or deficient; they are products of a system created largely by females that will excuse them and insulate them from their own deficiencies. Mothers will be mothers. Cucks will be cucks and they will try to wrap this idiocy up by putting on fake airs of nobility and pose as protectors of children. If I had my way, a cornerstone of Dissident thought would be to mandate proper teaching and training of our kids. The proper way to forge good adults from bad children is to expose them to their deficiencies in a constructive way and patiently help them to overcome those deficiencies. Not all kids can be helped but we owe it to them to try. A lot of those deficiencies in those children are just our own being reflected back at us.Another desperately needed skill amongst the Dissidents is good humour and cheerfulness in the face of adversity. Dissidents tend to be contemptuous of coping mechanisms… but they are actually useful tools when the SHTF. Perhaps  our life skills are deficient in ways too?Have a great weekend guys.

            This is a great post Filthie. I admire how you have taken responsibility and learned to be proud of maintaining a standard and holding your children to it. Good for you. Well done.There is an effort underway to create a new education system. It isn’t new really, but a re-constitution of an education system of an older much better order. In addition to returning to that standard it will have a component of explicit positive identity formation for our folk.I am not sure how we go from forums with anonymity to gathering more resources in this effort. We need good men to assist in putting it together and stewarding it. With a small number of dedicated folk for a short time we can make it happen without a lot of effort and then in stewardship it can be a background activity.Not sure how we get off the forums and connect on such projects but there must be a way. Ideally we find a hub person who is not in danger of being dox’d (sp?).

                Find a good school for your kids in real life?It may be hard for the unbelievers, but attend a conservative church run by men and talk to the white guys who have 5+ children.  Find out how/ where they educate their brood.There are “non-traditional” schools out there for those who do not homeschool.The Feebs were not wrong to target and surveil those who attend traditional masses.

                I would suggest some of the better churches. (That is a tough row to hoe because so many have been hopelessly pozzed).The home schoolers in our church banded together and have achieved fantastic results. The kids move far faster through the academic material, get extraordinary results on gov’t mandated and supervised tests… but they also go on more field trips, spend more time in sports and more time in extracurricular activities. It is astonishing to most normies and regular people how inefficient the public schools actually are. The first kids through the local homeschool programs are graduating early, with honors and are doing well in university. One of the kids recently graduated University and is a successful chemical engineer with a doctorate.It’s ironic. I dunno how many times I have seen chicken headed, young empowered single moms describe their feral goblins and delinquents as “amazing”. We are all supposed to go along and lavish them with attention and coddling and then act surprised when they crash and burn.  But lost in the background, hardly noticed, are truly amazing kids that will almost certainly become competent adults.There are valid reasons for my optimism.Sometimes.  😉

                    But are there any churches doing this?  There are federal standards they have to meet to keep their certifications.  Plus, most of the denominations have total SJW control of their national denomination headquarters.  The Southern Baptists kicked a church out of the denomination for refusing to excommunicate James Edwards.  This is pretty amazing when you think about it. They were willing to lose an entire congregation in order to kick one wrong-thinker out of the church.  I am unaware of a single Christian denomination that is not run by SJW churchians at the national level.

                        A friend and former colleague’s Catholic parish in Orange County California has such a homeschooler cooperative that provides many educational opportunities for the kids. I have heard of others and I know that the one in OC was inspired by others going back at least 20 years.   I am of course on the traditional end of end of the Catholic Church and know that parochial schools run the gamut. I would certainly recommend the local schools that belong to Latin Mass communities and I hear good things about the regular Catholic parish school where I have six grandnephews and grandnieces.   I regret very much that I didn’t send my own kids to Christian schools and I have immense respect for parents that do

                A “new education system” is desperately needed, and I’m glad to see someone else seriously advocating it.  I believe that the corruption of education in the West, from kindergarten through grad school, is one of the main reasons we’re in such a mess.  Many parents should share blame–absentee fathers, parents who blithely, happily send their kids to public schools,  parents who don’t pay attention to what is taught, the awful social conditions students suffer under, etc., etc.–but the educational indoctrination itself can’t be overestimated. College education departments are among the most destructive institutions ever.And I agree that Filthie deserves special kudos for this post.

                    I’ve been saying the same for a long time.  But it isn’t even just the schools.  It’s all the industries that cater to children in some way or another.  It’s toys. It’s kids books. It’s kids video. It’s educational programs either on TV or DVD/Blu-ray.  It is absolutely saturated with SJWism.  All this stuff causes their peers to be at complete odds with a kid you raise and shield from this stuff.I don’t know how it can be done, but we cannot create an alternative world for kids. We MUST get into the mainstream kids world and change it. Any attempt at building a parallel world for kids just delays the inevitable.  Maybe our efforts at inculcating these children will keep the worst of it at bay when they grow up, but it cannot totally defeat the cancer.  Peer pressure is just too strong.  How many of these kids will grow up, get flipped and then they hate and resent their parents for trying to shield them from this?

                        To Tars Tarkus:  When I was in my teens and early-20’s, I went through a liberal/left phase, and thank God my parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles had earlier instilled a love of history and the West, which eventually came back to me, and which I never gave up.  That was some decades ago, when the cultural rot had already seriously begun, but it wasn’t as advanced as now.  You’re right to point out the awful, evil saturation that kids face now.I wish I had a better answer, but as parents, grandparents,  aunts and uncles, we can at least still try to instill that love of what we inherited.  My elders took me to historic sites, gave me books about heroes and history, written before PC/Woke, and talked to me about who they admired and what they believed in, and how rotten things were getting.  We can still at least do those things.  And if we’re decent to our kids and grandchildren, while they might stray away at times, they also might come back to good sense.

            Great comment, particularly here:
“Another desperately needed skill amongst the Dissidents is good humour and cheerfulness in the face of adversity.”
So much that. It serves two purposes. First, it is wonderful for the mind and spirit, and secondly, like all totalitarian monsters before them, the Regime hates to be mocked.

            What you are describing is the development of self-esteem, distinct from self-centered. The youth are terribly self-centered but terribly deficient in tenacity. And, yes, this is a result of society and parenting.I am analytically minded and clever, but I am not a wit a la the famous sodomite. I do, however, occasionally come up with a decent metaphor.  I once stated to a friend that kids are a reflecting pool of our sins. Sometimes, you see it staring flatly back at you in their behavior. Other times, it is distorted like a wave pattern, but you can reconstruct the image if you look carefully.But, you the generation is worthless. Lay the blame where you want, but they are.Now, before I get the naysaying, I work with youths. I am actually lauded by young people and staff as special, in the good sense. But I must reflect that, in totality, the youth is worthless. My own kids, different story.

            I’ve read before that the rise in autism is why we’re seeing the rise in homosexuality and transgenderism. (Actually, an internet friend of mine enlightened me on that subject.) Women are having babies later than they were meant to be having babies. Maybe those are the unintended consequences of all of the new technologies we have for infertility. Or maybe it’s just an unintended consequence of birth control pills. Who knows.

                From what I understand, starting young is key. For instance, my great-grandmother had kids into her 40s— 10 total— and they weren’t screwed up. I don’t think that was too uncommon back then.

                TempoNick —
Severe (non-verbal) autism is directly connected to historically late childbirth in modern women.
And that is why the most important factor in autistic births is never mentioned, much less corrected.   Doesn’t serve the female imperative.  Millions of children suffer as a result of selfishness and careerism . . . meh.

            “I was accused of being unsuportive of my kid when I insisted that she get good marks in school, keep her nose clean, and learn to be helpful and useful. It got me cancelled and shoved out the airlock eventually and to be truthful… after much heart ache and soul searching and self doubt… I have managed to become oddly proud of it.”Nothing wrong with pushing your kid and demanding excellence, so long as you are doing it in a paternalistic manner and not being downright abusive. Sometimes there’s a fine line, but I don’t have a problem with demanding excellence.

        D.C. is a weird, insular, anachronistic place, the eight-track player of capitols. As a young man, I had to interact with two congressional staffers, long-timers who had dutifully served various elected corporate whores. They got into an interminable discussion about who had attended which political hump’s fundraiser/soiree with recollections of other parties hosted by obscure although important-to-them characters. My impression was this banal nonsense marked defining moments in their lives and also bordered on the insane. It is hard to imagine things have gotten better in the last three decades. I formed an opinion of Washington then and there and everything since has confirmed that assessment. It is hard to believe the Clouds who make those types’ lives possible have anything other than pure contempt and disdain for them (I’m certain this also applies to the propaganda whores in their employ).Lower tier hangers-on like those two and the people they served have been isolated from reality and have created their own world, which is totally divorced from reality. Trump, along with the Empire’s rapid decline, represent things that should not be possible, therefore they are not real to them in the sense of being anything other than fleeting inconveniences.When Trump was ousted in 2020, the visual that stuck with me was footage of working class, decent people crying over it, realizing at some level the world they had known and the country they had loved was dead. I’m certain the network producers who televised it had full erections. As pathetic as that was, think what will happen when those inside the D.C. bubble realize their worlds also are over. As we see with the open border, they are borderline suicidal already. It would surprise no one if they decided to take out humanity with nuclear weapons at that point.It is hard to imagine the Imperial Russian and German and Austrian families or their courtiers willing to burn down the world in such a way. It is difficult to imagine Washington’s version doing anything else.

            That’s 100 thumbs up right there.I wonder. The old Roman empire rose and fell, and saved itself many times by swapping democracies for tyrants, and then back again as circumstances required.If you dig into your history books there are plenty of examples where the kings and aristocracy had to be killed and replaced in order to preserve the nation.We are at a unique point in history… while we certainly could benefit by culling our leadership class… they are, as our esteemed blog host said – paid actors at best who read scripts. To affect a proper leadership change, the dirt class would need to go after THEIR bosses. While a few of them have come out of the shadows and exposed themselves… I will bet dollars to donuts there are many more lurking in the shadows.But whadda I know?

                    Jack Dodson: “Lower tier hangers-on like those two and the people they served have been isolated from reality and have created their own world, which is totally divorced from reality.”The Hive Mind of Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder is, on its on terms, and on its own turf, simply omnipotent.But lower-tier hangers-on move up the Passive Aggressive social ladder by stabbing one another in the back.They will never walk away from the safety of the Hive Mind, nor will they ever stop stabbing one another in the back.Long term, their moast important social trends are their lifetime Total Fertility Rates and their COVID V@xxination Rates.Yuge numbers of them will be Dykes &amp; Ph@gs, so their TFRs tend to be minute.OTOH, I wouldn’t be surprised if many of them were devious enough to have secretly exempted themselves from the COVID V@xxine mandates.That’s Passive Aggression in a nutshell: Inert Normal Saline injection pour moi, Pfizer Clot Shot Sterilization Death Sentence pour toi.

                I think there’s still a value in removing the “paid actors”. I think of it this way – we’ve been quietly conquered by reptoid aliens who turn certain humans into their mouthpieces and control their actions. The reptoids are clever but they don’t themselves wield any firepower or command any troops. Their entire power-base is through deception. If they want you dead or in jail, they have to command one of their human flunkeys to kill you or lock you up.It might be useful to know who the reptoids really are and where they really live, but their power can be neutralized without this.

                I can’t say this strongly enough: When you are going after the banksters, don’t forget that the administrative state needs some culling as well. That’s also where much of the problem lies. They wouldn’t even leave Syria after he ordered them too because they had no problem waiting out Trump until another globalist took the presidency. This Ukraine stuff is also a function of our permanent government.

                The logistics seem programmed into newer EV’s.  Certainly on Tesla’s.  You program the destination in, and the charging stations appear, with the rates and times of each stop.  The times are minimized/optimized to get you to the next charging stop without too much wait time.  So it’s possible—even probable—that you pull into a charging station with a half charged battery, and leave with a 75% charge and an 30 minutes wait—rather than a 90% charge and a two hour wait.  Off to the next one.  Rinse, repeat…Of course the problem has been with chargers out of order and a waiting line at the chargers.  That seems less predictable in an environment where charging stations are not solely owned, or rather coordinated, and some EV’s are still pretty stupid.YouTube is full of tales of such vehicles.  At the dealership, I was told of a previous buyer who decided to go down the MX in his new EV sold from the same dealer.  He stopped at a resort city only to find no *functioning* chargers.  He had to rent a hotel room and run 120v extension cord to the EV and charge over night to get “out of Dodge”.Like I said, don’t give up your ICE vehicle on the alter of Gaia.

            Ancedotal but might be something to it. Tnere’s a high end auto mechanic not too far from me I sometimes cycle past in the evening. Come to think of it, I can’t remember any particular instance of seeing beamers in the lot waiting for repair. Mercedes, the odd Audi, a Bentley once in a great while, but no BMWs. Sure they do one some time; Japanese people are crazy stupid about keeping their cars in working order.

                Back in high school, for a little while, I jockeyed cars to an auto auction for a shop. Cool job for a high school kid. Got to drive a Ferrari 308 once, which was awesome because I was a Magnum PI fan growing up.
Anyway, I drove Mercedes, Audis, and BMWs mostly. Didn’t really like the BMWs— no quirks or imperfections that give cars a personality imo. Blandly perfect. I used to describe them as the Megan Fox of autos.
Any rate, I’ve always heard they’re a nightmare to work on, so it’s probably good that they’re apparently reliable.

                This is true. Paid spots also run on television, radio and in newspapers disguised as objective news now, which should surprise no one. This started about a decade or so back as corporate media became strapped.

                Plausible… but upon closer inspection… empirical evidence suggests it’s true. FT notes above the dearth of Beemers in the service station parking lot. Also anecdotal are the used car ads. You may see the odd, clapped out Beemer with a million miles on it but very few new pristine ones. The buyers are hanging on to them and only letting them go when absolutely necessary… or so it would seem…

                Yep, CR is now (maybe always) a poz’d publication.  In any event, they are not always correct in their product evaluations.   It’s not necessarily that their testing is bad, but the parameters they decide are essential/important are not always correct and therefore not evaluated.Case in point.  Many years ago—pre Tech boom—I had the responsibility of ordering simplistic phone answering machines for our “help desk”.  The consultants manning the desk would handle walk ins as well as phone ins.  When with a student, the phone would ring 5 times and then go to answer mode for a “leave a message, we’ll call you back” response.I, being no dummy (translation, educated beyond common sense) opened the CR issue where CR rated all the answering machines and chose to buy the CR “Best Buy recommendation.  What could go wrong?Well, it seems CR did not think to consider the ability to erase specific messages!  The erase was for *all* messages or no messages.  So that if the first message for call back was unreachable, and the second in line caller was contacted, then either the second completed message remained or the first caller was dropped without a completed call back.This one minor consideration created havoc and a lot of disgruntled students and faculty and we replaced the machines—some not even out of the box—within a month.  Fortunately, being with the university, an academic entity, meant no trip to the woodshed for me.  We simply send the items onto “surplus property” for disposal.

                    I don’t mind (and frequently used) their small appliance recommendations.  When they waded into politics, though, I was done.I don’t mind BMW’s, but they have a weird status symbol vibe here.  In Europe, the 3-series are used as taxis.I got a free upgrade to a 3-series while traveling.  The interior controls are both stupid and bafflingly complex at the same time.  The check engine light kept telling me to pull over immediately and call for help.  I returned it and got a free future rental.As far as CR goes, there’s enough good free competition now that I don’t need them.

            BMWs tend to be well-made. They do use a lot of bespoke parts, and thus more difficult access and expensive.The crappiest car company of main note is probably Fiat – that owns Chrysler, Jeep, etc.When Z talks about buying a new Jeep, I shudder for him. Horrible vehicles since the purchase.

                Yeah, did that quite a few times.  Jeep folks are a strange lot.  You read the user groups and when you point out a flaw, the response usually is, “so what, it’s a Jeep”.  They sold me way back their 1st ZF transmission, 9 speed auto.  ZF is a German firm, not Italian.  Soon the complaints rolled in and the arguments in the user groups started.  Folks claiming the new transmission had no higher rate of failure than others.  They were even sued class action.  ZF  9-speed was killed second year.  Guess no one liked to pony up $8-9k for a replacement.  BTW: other than a ridiculous programming/matching of trans to engine power curve, I never had a lick of problems.  Gave it to daughter a few months back.

        “Trump is the scourge sent by the gods to punish the managerial class.” Yes, this. And who the gods would destroy they first make mad.
The trick for the dirt people will to ride out the storm. This means not being where it will be worst (big cities), staying away from those who will act the worst (you know of whom I speak), and being prepared for “that will never happen!”.

        It’s a war.  You need warriors.D.T. is an eighties-era liberal, with a feminist daughter who often controls him (and thus, everyone around him), and plenty of old mafia connections because you don’t build in NYC without them.  Donald’s a real estate developer, entertainer, and financier.Last time out he tried to glad-hand D.C., gladhanding always working for him before.  Heh.  First act upon victory: wave off any consequences for that insect queen, Hilarious.  After that nobody in the beltway took him seriously, so Lady Columbia booked him for a jolly four-year Vexation Cruise.In the closing act, D.T. backed the poison vax, told his supporters to get mad at the election theft . . . then tipped on out to Mar-a-Lago.  Not exactly warrior-material.We shall see if he has learned anything by his prosecutions, and by the failure of his first term.

            Not to mention pardoning a bunch of degenerates, many of whom were members of the tribe and lowlife rappers. Many of these pardons showed the worst impulses of his term – his tendency to reward people who glad-handed him, and his constant attempts to curry the favor of the juice (even though they helped engineer the color revolution that ousted him). And what he didn’t do – like a Snowden pardon – also showed off his tendency to talk more than act (although I do believe that he would have gotten JFK’d if he pardoned Assange, and he was told that).

                There has to be a simple way around the Senate controlled cabinet appointments, because the president (I am pretty sure) is invested with the legal authority to command all the executive branch federal agencies. So just don’t nominate any cabinet secretaries. Issue orders to the agencies. It’s a lot for one man to do, but presidents have aides. What am I missing here?

                    There are a number of ways around it.  Here in this State, the Governor simply hired these guys under a different title outside of “Director of the ‘Agency’” and let them run the particular agency in lieu of an appointed (and vetted by the Senate) Director/Head.  If you’ve the votes of your party, you can’t be impeached and the agency in question does as you want.

                    Well, given the order of succession to the presidency established by the 25th Amendment of CONUS is predicated on a ranked hierarchy of Cabinet Secretaries, I can easily see a SCOTUS opinion finding a requirement to appoint based on the penumbral reasoning made famous in Griswold v. Connecticut (penumbral right of privacy justified unenumerated right to birth control), which was then extended to justify abortion in Roe v. Wade. Pandora’s box has been opened…

                Anyone who’d take the job would have to be a mad bastard.  After all, the regime has spent several years exacting gleeful goblin vengeance on anyone associated with him.
Actually, that’s another reason I’m not optimistic about Trump getting back in:  assuming he did, any appointees could ONLY be dragon-scaled, morally impeccable, flaming sword-bearing mad bastards with laminated  hitlists they’d been working on since at least 1995.  I doubt this will be allowed.

            “plenty of old mafia connections because you don’t build in NYC without them”It’s not that I don’t believe this, but why didn’t the ruling class persecute BOM along those lines, instead of ludicrous prosecutions where there is in fact no crime at all? Like the absurd NY “fraud” case where exactly no one was defrauded, or the fruitcake woman who claims Trump startled her in a dressing room 300 years ago, or trying to make it a crime for this one president to retain his personal records, something done by every single president. One might think at some point BOM bribed some inspector to approve substandard construction or got kickbacks from a contractor. No. Instead we were served preposterous crap exposed as baseless, like the hilariously implausible Steele dossier and Russiarussiarussia. Either Orange Fabio truly was a scrupulous developer, or there’s some other motive behind pushing the batshit crazy Fani Willis stuff and disregarding potential ordinary white collar crimes… but those ordinary ones would be more likely to win sympathy for the prosecution, being easily understood. On the contrary, the ruling class pursued byzantine accusations and exotic legal theories. Very odd.

                It’s been a long time since the cosa nostra had that much pull in NYC. Probably not a lot of evidence that has survived the decades. And even if there was, unearthing it and making a case out of it would involve a lot of, like, actual work.

            The usual suspects hate Putin because he kicked out the (((Oligarchs))).The rubes hate Putin because the people on TV tell them to.
I doubt Putin is a populist paradigm-shifter like Trump. Putin is a product of his culture: intelligent, calculating, a bit murderous, and charismatic in a Slavic way. Russia’s perfect leader.
Trump is a product of (a dying) American culture: industrious, high-energy, brand-focused, and charismatic in a bombastic American way. America’s perfect leader.
Problem is the America that produced a Trump is rapidly becoming an America that produces Letitia Jameses.

        Trump is useful. Either as a boogeyman, very effective at uniting various nutcases into one front, or as a sedative for grillers, who think that owning the libs is what it’s all about. Or as a way to get Whites fight for Israel, which is what “they” are hoping for if he is allowed to win.

        Class is a touchy subject we’re not supposed to talk about.  Poor people think it’s money and stuff – the richest man in the world (Bernard Arnault) got there by selling “luxury goods” to poor people who think an overpriced, cripplingly expensive handbag or a nice watch will fool people into thinking they’re now part of the high class club.David Brooks (vomit) does an excellent job describing actual class: education pedigree, parental lineage, degrees on the wall, awards given to them by their self-licking professional ice cream cone mills.Definitely not just money: Musk and Trump will never be “high class” and the fact that they don’t care drives some people nuts.The failure of our “high class” today is this:  Why would anyone want to aspire to it?  What function do they serve?  If they vanished tomorrow would anyone even notice?Pre-French revolution vibes.

                    Indeed. Class and ostentation are two different and arguably antinomian things. The vast majority of rich and wealthy in AINO have no class whatsoever, although they endeavor to demonstrate otherwise by lavish material display. True class, in my opinion, lies in a measured appreciation for the finer things in life, almost all of which are the fruit of western civilization. Personal wealth has absolutely nothing to do with it.

                    In the analog days, you could tell the status of someone in Washington by their briefcase. A staffer had a big leather bag stuffed with papers, while senior staffer would have a smaller bag not stuffed to the max. A man with a thin briefcase, one that would hold almost nothing, was going to be a lobbyist. Pols never carried anything, as they had staff for it.Status signaling is always there in every human organization. When it comes to cars, the rich often drive a beater, but something like an old Volvo or an old Merc wagon, as a form of countersignaling.

                        Truly wealthy need to concern themselves with practical issues such as kidnapping and ransoms. They’ll commonly own a beater to avoid detection but ride in a limosine to attend house parties. It’s sensical.

                        Yep. I’ve seen it over and over in Virginia’s horse and wine country. Really rich people, especially old-money rich, very often drive old pick-ups and dress casually. (Though they also have very nice cars in addition to the beater.)
They don’t need to show people that they’re rich because they only hang out with other rich people who already know who they are. And they don’t care what people outside of their class think of them.

I drive a 2004 Volvo S60. It’s got less than a hundred thousand miles on it, leather seats and it’s still works. It’s all I need. It was my mom’s car when she died. Too nice to sell for the ridiculously small amount of money it would bring. I’m perfectly able to afford a new car.
I don’t really consider myself rich, but for countersignaling, absolutely. I love marching to my own drummer.

                Wrong. I went to a fund-raising event in the Virginia’s horse country. The parking lost was full of BMWs, Range Rovers, etc. People wearing expensive casual clothes.
The richest, most old-money guy – who owned the horse stables/estate where the party was held – shows up in his old, beat-up pick-up truck wearing old jeans and a nice but not fancy sweater.
He didn’t need to prove anything. His money, family line, club memberships, relations with politicians, etc., showed who he was.

                    This is spot on. I know of an extremely wealthy neighborhood where the residents themselves go to their grocery store in pajamas; the nouveaux riche in a nearby area usually have others shop for them and the few times they do the dirty themselves they dress to the nines.
People with actual jack really don’t give a damn what others think about them.

                Hun:  Nope.  When a friend’s boyfriend had a ‘bimmer ‘ in 1979, it was something I took note of (hadn’t even heard of the vehicle prior to that).  When a guy I dated in the mid ’80s had a Porsche convertible, it was great fun.  Now, the only people driving them are blaqs, subcons, and east Asians.  Strivers in crime, social status, and materialism.  Even as late as 1990, I would have said a Bentley meant class, but that’s been debased by Hollywood and the blaqs too.Trying to recall what the genuinely wealthy and American upper-class people I worked for one summer drove – but it was none of the flashy cars.  I know I drove their old Land Rover at their beach house, and her mother had an older Rolls.  They didn’t really display their wealth in cars – it was massive homes with back staircases and live-in servants, flying on private planes, and being listed in the Social Register.

            You and Brooks (vomit) are quite right–Who has more class (and status) in AINO? A very successful plumber in Lynchburg, Virginia making 750K per annum, or an obscure anthropology professor at the University of Boston making 75K per year? There can be no doubt.
But who is actually more valuable to society? Aye. There’s the rub.

                    Many of them do. Profs at many universities–not to mention JUCOs–start out at around 50K per annum, and there are PLENTY of plumbers who make quite a bit more than that. On average, however, yeah, profs probably make more than plumbers, but not by much.

                    At my last teaching job, I taught an 80% load (eight classes per year, max for a part-timer) and made less than $16k.
At another part-time job I made $2000 per course to teach convicted murders in prison.
The highly-paid tenured professors making $130-150k and carrying on about “social justice” are fucking hypocrites, half the classes in their universities are taught by part-timers and grad students earning the equivalent of minimum wage.

Their lives are so full fulfilling nonsense obligations for a check mark there is no way for any passion to rise.

            Limbaugh used to talk about his. After he made a huge boatload of money as a Republican Party water-carrier, Zionist shill, and Negro sportsball fan, he wanted to buy an NFL team — and they treated him like a homeless bum in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton.
The fact that he was from Missouri, had no college degree, was anti-abortion, and appealed to the rubes in flyover country meant that he would never be allowed into the upper class no matter how much money he had.
I don’t think he ever got over that.

        On a wintry day in New York, as Donald Trump was debating whether to run for president for the first time, it must have occurred to him that his life would be irrevocably changed by the event — bent out of shape the way light is twisted when it enters a prism. Now, applying for his second chance at the office, Trump is a changed man, scarred inevitably by his experiences in the shark-eat-shark world of the national political arena. The media loves to broadcast his image as much as it loves to pile on top of him. Half the country thinks he is the devil; internationally, he is feared and reviled. What to do, what to do?It is not Donald J. Trump’s fault that he is a polarizing agent. His brash New York upbringing guaranteed more than a big mouth: it guaranteed he would step on toes. You need steel-toed boots when you’re walking around the Trump ideological forklift. Trump will cut you if he can — he refuses to take slights lying down.The media reaction is like a day in the African scrub. There’s an inviting watering pool on a hot sunny day. The wind sloughs through the underbrush. The water looks still, harmless. This is the media presentation of itself as harmlessly neutral, unbiased. A gazelle (a politician) comes to the shoreline to drink.Suddenly the media crocodile lunges out of the water, seizing the gazelle by the neck.The Donald has been fighting crocodiles all his life. His career in the tabloid newspapers has left scars on his bunched fists. He just refuses to yield.When a lying bitch accused him of raping her in a public store, antipathetic New Yorkers on the jury went Unh-huh, Unh-huh. He is a man so hated in his own home territory that they are willing to bend Justice to get him — like light bending through a prism. There is a darkness about the whole affair. Covered in a hard plastic done and shielded from the sun, the American flag stops waving long enough to curse the nation.In the end, Trump is a Rorshach test. What you see in him tells as much about you as him. What I see in Donald Trump is a highly intelligent man, caged by buffoons and made to dance to get another shot of a lifetime at a lifetime dream. May the political gods smile on his auspices.— Xloveli (dark.sport.blog)

            Trump was way ahead of his time, in building a personal “brand” before the internet gave people a broad forum for doing exactly that.  His brand is him, and he works it daily.  Trump anticipated the whole concept a decade or two before it was widely implemented.
The rest of the political players are weak cheese at building their brands, because they lead with politics.  Trump leads with cultural cues and the political stuff follows along later.
The politicos don’t understand all of that, and that is another reason they hate and fear him so much.

            Trump is a dictator (capitalistic CEO) out of his environment—my way or the highway.  This was always my concern with his running for President with no political experience.  Some say he’s learned his lesson.  We shall see, assuming he gets a second chance.

        Re: Jonah Goldberg being proud of not being able to fix things around the house.My wife and I had lunch with a retired couple a few months ago. When the subject of home repair and maintenance came up, one of them said, “We’re Jews. We don’t know how to do that kind of stuff!” The other nodded in agreement.
At the time, it struck me as an odd thing to be bragging about. The guy had been a pharmacist, not some middle-manager drone. He’s also fairly based on covid and skeptical of the medical business generally.

                    My dad’s ancestors came here from England in the mid 17th cent and he hates it when I point out how Jews are over represented in influential positions, even against things he cares about as a conservative. He won’t allow it, Jews somehow became untouchable in the past 75 years

            It’s like women who proudly proclaim “I don’t cook.” It’s not just that they are proud of not cooking, they are proud ofnot knowing how. It’s a status marker. What kind of sick culture recognizes that as status, and how we got there, well I guess you could write a book.

                That attitude almost died a couple decades ago, at least among men. A wildly viral fad started among bohemian types, then called “hipsters,” actually rich young Jews, for ostentatious expertise in obscure blue-collar fields, manly displays of time- and money-wasting—rich-man daredevilry for physical cowards. Beekeeping, blacksmithing, and beer brewing were the big ones. The bee guys got laid, the anvil guys ruled YouTube for a while, the beer guys got bought out by InBev, and they all heavily influenced “the culture” (media) because their friends and families own it. The wealthiest guy I know became a custom cabinetmaker to the stars—incidentally to his trust-fund blue-collar LARP. All he wanted was to show hammered knuckles to poor girls at the bar.

                That’s been a trait of the aristocracy forever. Common work–such as cooking, farming, conducting business–is for commoners, not the social elite.
PS–An exception was the pre-19th century Russian nobility, who actually took delight in getting their hands dirty, grubbing for money and doing a spot of manual labor.
