        The Democratic Party is the party of weaklings and freaks- blacks, single women, gays, the handicapped and poor, and people who make money of these people and use them for power, Jews and certain kinds of businessmen.I don’t have anything against weaklings and freaks, but they are dependents and not to be in control. They are functionally police, policing anybody who might say what they actually are.The Catholic clergy became a place to put misfits, including homosexuals, and eventually the misfits took over and made being a misfit a qualification for the priesthood. This happened in the 12th century, well before the Reformation, but it made the Reformation inevitable. A socially functional person has a hard time being a Democratic officeholder, since they must always be a little apologetic for their straightness or marriage or whiteness. Obama, a straight, married, black male is about as functional as it is possible to be. O’Malley has no chance, whatever his liberal credentials.

        Back in ’08 this music pretty much nailed what was happening to the Democrat Party under Obama.

        Progressivism gives the afflicted permission to be smug, look down on others, lash out with the most personal, vitriolic attacks, and wreck the system of government if they can manage that. I don’t see it losing its’ appeal to the emotionally undeveloped anytime soon.

        You are an incurable optimist. I’m not complaining–it’s refreshing and makes me think, but the progressive lunacy possesses an intelligence that only replicates itself into another host while the first host is dying. It never gives back what is gained. Democracy is the most fertile ground for it imaginable. I question that we know where the bottom is in that.

        Good post. I like these under-the-radar sort of observations.  Not to nitpick, but in the eighth paragraph, you meant “throne”, not “thrown”, eh?
