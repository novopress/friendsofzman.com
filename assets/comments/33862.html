        Women also love Taylor Swift because they are told to love TS in the same way they are told to hate Big Orange and White Supremacy.All of which goes to Z’s point. If women are told to love an AI star, who knows, they may love an AI star. The only thing I’m not sure about is to what extent AI won’t be able to capitalize on their need to look at the star and think “that could be me!” it might come down to the degree of realism of the AI star. If something feels real to a woman she believes it is real.I suppose a workaround to get women to accept AI stars will be to tell them that only hateful people don’t either love AI stars or think they aren’t real. After all if you can easily get young women to think that they were born in the wrong body and are really a man, anything is possible.

            Yeah, women are known to let’s say, follow the pack. They’re even known to be pack enforcers.I remember as a young lad, seeing video of all those young white women going apeshit for The Beatles on Ed Sullivan. And this was the 1960s, when white women weren’t as retarded as they are now. I thought, geez, are women really this f**king nuts?

                Females are herd beings. Easily manipulated and controlled by social cueing, positioning and related phenomena.
The past half-century as eternal proof.
As for the Fab Four, look at the clips of concerts back then. It was not women filling the auditoriums, screaming and gyrating wildly — it was ADOLESCENT GIRLS. To explain that would require an entire essay, but be assured it has to do with sexuality and the onrushing Feminist Age.

                        Concerning Sinatra, watch this entire vidya…
https://tinyurl.com/y4yjwx74
And pay special attention to Sinatra’s final Stage Left to Stage Right strut…
I was always a Sinatra sceptic, until I stumbled upon that strut.
He had some legit pizzazz in his act.
Gotta acknowledge it.
Credit where credit is due.
The diction &amp; the rhythm alone are A+++.

                    I think I read somewhere that the Beatles quit doing live performances because the screaming was so loud the music could hardly be heard.  Hell, my wife watches the Kelly clarkson show and it’s exactly the same, tho on a much smaller scale.  And to think some of those screamers may grow up to be your governor, senator or ceo, lol.

                        The Beatles were interested in the music, whereas for the girl-fans it was about some type of primitive, collectivized sexual frenzy. . . with attendant screaming, of course.
Straight outta a D.H. Lawrence short story.
By no means a new phenomenon in human experience.  Their early shows were more of a fertility rite than concert.
So yeah the Beatles concentrated on studio productions and dumped the live shows.

                        Also that the demand for Beatles performances had gotten large enough that they could and did fill stadiums, but the sound technology at the time simply didn’t permit those shows to sound any good (the stadiums at the time just piped sound through their PA systems) nor for the Beatles to know what the heck they were doing (lack of in-ear monitors to hear their own performance so they had little idea if they were in sync, in tune, etc.).Plus the swarming had gotten so out of hand, that at their very last performance at Candlestick Park (IIRC), they got ferried to &amp; from the stadium in the back of a meat truck I think. They sat in the back of said truck at the end of that show and said, screw this, this isn’t worth it any more.

                I dunno Marko.I look at the women out at the little chapel in the country I go to and those women are different animals for the most part. They’re smart, warm, practical and critical thinkers. They’re all happily married, with tons of happy kids and being there is like being in a Norman Rockwell painting. The big struggle for them is raising their kids and keeping the hooks of pop culture away from their kids. They are not always successful. But they are not loons.By contrast the women from my former progressive family are just horrid. None are happy (unless they’re making someone miserable) and the malice is right off the scale.Women are not supposed to be like this. But… nor are their men supposed to be like that either…Whadda I know?

                        There are a couple posters whose commentary on women constantly throws off “it’s all da wayman’s fault” vibes. There’s also a lot of older bachelors on this discussion forum. Thus, there tends to be edge about the other half of humanity.Two posts are looking at their women at their worst, in their teenage years. The other poster is looking at the best situation, which is a free woman married, who loves her children and husband. The later does exist, even if older bachelor men don’t have an example in their immediate vicinity. That’s why feminism is so destructive to women, well before men. Women are never at their absolute best without free investment into either family or God. Careers and Taylor Swift are poor substitute for the prospect of grand children.Meanwhile, I’m sure that the men here can name a lot of emotional idiocy in their teenage years. The men were not turning down the sex that emotional orgies for the Beatles encouraged. There’s multiple failures involved when feminism enters the room.

                            It’s ok, lady. You can write our names, you don’t have to make anon accusations. (You wimmin shore do love you some accusations, hmm?)
And on this small island of truth amidst the continent of lies that is our feminist society, we don’t have to think what you want. Lady.
BTW I call out simps and cucks constantly, including on this page. I also call out dotter-daddies, who are the hidden drivers of our gynarchies.
You can’t handle the truth about yourselves, mebbe head on over to Snopes or HuffPost? They’ll tell you what you want to hear over there.

                                        Thanks.  But that word was tongue-in-cheek I expect.The women in my past and present would refute that I hate women.  I take the (authentic, not Churchian) Christian position about females, and I assert that female rulership of the Western nations is the chief cause of their decline, atomization and psycho-spiritual sickness.I do not want women and their hirelings to rule over me, over my brothers, and over my nation.  If U.S. men really loved women, and if dotter-daddies really loved their girls, they would never groom them for the feminist life.  But New Amerika has made it very hard for dads to turn away from the financial benefits of that.

Bingo! I feel the exact same way that Ray does about women as described in his post, I was not naming or shaming him.  Remember, anything short of effusive praise for women makes you a misogynist these days.

                        I suppose I do, maybe? A little bit?I was blessed with a good woman. We just had our big 40 last month. I don’t get it – there are any number of men here better than I who’ve been cursed with ghastly wives and exes they did not deserve. For some reason I won the wife lottery.So far I’ve been blessed with a mostly good church too. We’ve had queers, “female clerics” and feminists, and socialists take their runs at us but none of it ever amounts to anything. In our church the Bible says what it means and means what it says. Evil people can’t do a darn thing against you if you are true to your faith.And I’m blessed to be here on this forum. A lot of you guys live closer to the cutting edge of things, you see and notice the things our church elders refuse to even acknowledge. There are other places where intelligent men and women gather… but this is hands down the best site of its type that I know of. I see and learn things here I’d never get anywhere else.Utopia is where you find it, perhaps… and what you make of it.

                    That’s because those women are part of a healthy herd. Women are thermometers, not thermostats. If you’re looking at the women of an area and they look like Mad Max extras as they engage in mindless consumerism with nary a child in sight, they’re loyal devotees of clownworld, and they live in it. If you’re looking at the women of an area and they are modestly dressed and with children, you’re looking at somebody from the “return to sanity” camp. Likewise, the area they inhabit is probably a healthy place.Women typically act as enforcers for the status quo and/or whatever the powers and authorities in a given area have deemed proper (when it’s both, it’s particularly effective). That’s great when you have a moral and ordered society. If, in one of these, a property manager wants to bring in casinos, sex shops, and strip clubs into your mild mannered town,, it’s going to be the women showing up to Town Hall meetings and going door to door. If you live in a modern atomized hellscape, they’ll be the ones lobbying to bring drag queen story hour to your local library and to organize a gay pride parade. Women will always try to stay on the right side of power.Keeping the “hooks” of pop culture out of women basically boils down to keeping globalist elites from convincing women that clown world is the norm/status quo and that they are the power to be beholden to.

                It’s not just women.  A lot of men are the same way, though women probably are worse in this aspect.  We’re tribal in nature and want to fit in with the group.  Social cues are one of the ways this is done.  It’s why so much of this is done through celebrities.   Men tend to adapt to what women want, so controlling the women tends to controlling the men as a side effect.

Bingo!  It is all about control.  If you haven’t, i suggest you read the book the postman, much better then the movie and the author has some interesting thoughts on what you just stated.

                You must be too young to remember Elvis.  Girls/women screamed and threw their undergarments at him when he performed.  Earlier there was Frank Sinatra, one of the original “crooners” who used to get similar treatment, but without the undergarments.  This behavior goes waaaaay back, so to answer your question, “Yes, they are this nuts.”

            Important to remember that Talyor Swift’s father (Scott Swift) is a finance guy (Swift Group under Merrill Lynch).
The whole Tay Tay enterprise has been managed as a serious business from day one.
I personally don’t understand the appeal, but she had an in credible advantage from day one by not having to count on the carnies that run music labels.

                Yes, it’s quite clear that the last pop stars exist as a result of blueblood business connections. Pop culture channels keep asking why Pedro Pascal (probably not completely hispanic), Zendaya, and Rachel Ziegler keep their jobs. It has to do with deep connections into the industry, not their talent.

                    Pedro Pascal’s uncle was a spook connected to the US in his home country, i suspect that is how Pedro got here and landed his career.  Did some research on him in 2020 when he had a big mouth and was acting stupid.

                        I would not be surprised at all to discover connections between the CIA and Swift. Swift clearly is a Manufactured Entity, of great use to a nation desiring to emasculate the citizenry.
It was the CIA and the Rockefellers, chiefly, that shepherded the U.S. into gynolatry and gynocracy.

                That means the end of liberal capitalism. I would prefer Christian monarchy myself (real monarchy, not the fake variety as in Britain). I understand that such a change would be a longshot, esp. in the anti-monarchical USA and that the  actual replacement for liberal capitalism could be worse.

        Anyone else here old enough to recall the Brady Bunch episode in which Greg Brady was going to be promoted as a pop star? Was it his singing skill, his moves or his dashing good looks that set him up for stardom?Nope. He simply ‘fit the suit’. Literally. The promoter had an outfit that his manufactured teen idol would wear, and Greg Brady was a perfect fit for it. They changed his name (‘Johnny Bravo’) and distorted his recorded voice to sound nothing like his real one.Of course, this being a 30 minute morality play, Greg Brady rejected the falseness of manufactured stardom. He refused to sell his soul, even as the promoter laments that he coulda been huge. Taylor Swift has gone the other route, embracing the falseness and rot, to her stupefying financial gain. She ‘fit the suit’ that her target audience wishes for her, and I suspect that she is perfectly fine with that.

                The day after Christmas, Dec 26, 969 was the premiere of the Brady Bunch episode, “Is There a Doctor in the House?”
That episode was all about the measles.
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0531101/
Guess what they didn’t have in 1969?
.....
ANSWER: They didn’t haveV@XXINATIONS!!!
They simply trusted their innate immune system, and dealt with the situation.
PS: THEY ALSO DIDN’T HAVEAUTISM!!!﻿

            Despite her wealth, there is something pathetic about the “portly spinster”, as the Z Man has termed her. Such is always the case for someone who has sold her soul to Mammon.

                Z:“it is the young-ish females you see kicking around the cubicle farms of corporate America, and thirsty males who think a Taylor Swift concert is an opportunity for them”Dutchboy:“someone who has sold her soul to Mammon”Marko:“women are known to let’s say, follow the pack”Muh instincts are screaming at moi that the underlying psycho-sociological phenomenon at work here is the “Lady MacBeth” Syndrome.LMS lives in Cluster B [of course], and it’s an inversion of traditional sexual roles, with the Lady MacBeth insisting on wearing the pants in the fambly, and her husband largely living in fear of her Borderline Personality Disorder’ed volcanic rage.Oddly enough, Marko’s “thirsty males” are precisely the men whom the Ladies MacBeth seek to marry; in Z’s football terms, they’re the tight ends.But the “thirsty male” husband is NOT the sire of Lady MacBeth’s children; Lady MacBeth simply waits patiently until she’s ovulating, then when the poor sorry Tight End is out of town on a bidness trip, and as soon as the coast is clear, she dials up Chad Thundercock [aka quarterback Tom Brady], to be implanted with the Alpha seed.As a very young man, fresh outta school, I got my first experience with the Lady MacBeth Syndrome, way back in 1994, which just so happened to be the same year that John Gunderson finally got Borderline Personality Disorder ensconced in the DSM IV.That summer, I left my Lady MacBeth, and never saw her again, but just recently, I came to learn that she and her Beta husband never got around to having any children.I’m very worried now that our White Christian Women have become so thoroughly psychologically poisoned by the (((Feminism Psy-Op))) that many of our men are simply calling it quits.And in the back of my mind, I’m starting to envision the White race with massively large Black Widow female personalities dominating over teeny-tiny little Black Widow male personalities.It’s said that Black Widow females can weigh anywhere fromTEN TO ONE HUNDRED &amp; SIXTYtimes as much as Black Widow males.And I’m starting to feel that that’s what the Feminism Psy-Op and the Lady MacBeth Syndrome are doing to the White Race: Our LMS women are becoming anywhere from 10 to 160 times more psychologically vicious than are their mealy-mouthed limp-wristed Beta husbands.There’s also the problem of so many Ladies MacBeth secretly copulating with the very same Chad Thundercock to the point that literal physical incest is going to become much more prevalent in our society, simply because too many children won’t know who their true biological father really was, and it will become increasingly common that half-brothers &amp; half-sisters will be marrying one another, completely oblivious to the fact that their true biological fathers were precisely one &amp; the same Chad Thundercock.There’s a reason that the White Race was the only race to achieve true monogamy; all the other races of the Earth never evolved beyond raw naked animalistic polygamy, and if the White Race loses its devotion to Monogamy, then I don’t know who the hell is gonna hold this species together anymore.

                        The funny thing is the slur Incel.  I can get poonanny, but i feel empty sleeping with people i have no connection with.  A girl i almost married was everything i wanted at the beginning, then as her neediness and complaining started to kill my attraction she started searching for a new man, not break up mind you, monkey branching.  When on hundreds of dates after that (lived in the city) slept with some women, none were dating or marriage material.  What they don’t get is that i choose not to date or marry the slop they’ve created via “culture”.  You can’t say the Nword, but you can call white people anything.  Liberals never seem to grasp this.  Its all about control.  And the girl i almost married was baptist, and now she’s a raging liberal.  So ya know, people who say meet a woman at church aren’t hitting the mark.

                                This was before that!  She and i broke up about two years into Obama so we were still about five years away from the full onslaught of resurgent feminism.  Which goes to show how they really are more of a herd animal then men.  I blame men for not being able to stand up for themselves in the pursuit of the kitty.  But even in most corporate jobs i’ve had, the women were like this.  They try to act sweet and nice to get you to do their work for them, and when you don’t the toxic rumor mill begins.

                            Who has the U.S. government outright named as the enemy?‘Incels’, men’s advocates in the manosphere, and ‘white supremacists’.  Out of an entire world of real and present evil, THIS is what the gynarchy fears: brotherhood, especially Christian brotherhood or brotherhood that speaks honestly about what New Amerika really is.Tells us everything we need to know about who really rules over us.  The incel slur is just the gynarchy seeking to anathematize any male who doesn’t genuflect to the Empowered Ones and their gyno-gubbermint.I am over 70 and have no trouble attracting young women, yet I have been VOLUNTARILY celibate for decades.  My buddies get a big kick outta this.Amerikan women hate that and must pretend to themselves that I am a basement-dwelling, cheeto-encrusted ‘incel’ who can’t get female attraction and sex.  That millions of other U.S. men are VOLUNTARILY celibate is terrifying to the Regime, for they count on men always caving to women because sex.  When men opt out of that VOLUNTARILY, they get skeered, real skeered.Sour grapes, just more bitter gaslighting and scapegoating.

                                    Very common story from men in Western nations.
I didn’t get much attention at all from females until I hit about 30. Made sense to me, tho. Prior to that, I didn’t have many accomplishments, didn’t have a profession, money, confidence etc.
After 30? Baby the dam broke loose! And hasn’t really stopped since. Not bragging, just the facts.

Look at the overreaction to that Netflix show ‘Adolescence’ in Europe to see just how correct Ray is about this situation.  They want docile little servants that worship women and would sell out their family for a chance at having sex.  Hard to believe the enemy has so mismanaged their position that men are now capable of taming their own biology just to make a point.

        It’s kind of funny that most men don’t find Taylor Swift attractive at all and most women think she is beautiful.She is a cute girl but I know nothing of her music. The best thing she could do is marry that nfl player (the white guy) and have lots of kids.Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie had tremendous talent. Alison Moyet of Yaz and the lead singer of Mazzy Star were fantastic, as well. ‘Mama’ from The Mamas and the Pepes always reminded me of Alison Moyet.Madonna has become her true self and is a hideous monster.

            It is funny you mention it. Whenever Taylor Swift comes up with my buddies, we always say something like, “There is some strangely off-putting about her.” Frankly, I stared at her shows online for about an hour the other day trying to figure it out and the best I got was the line about old people calling her pretty.
Alison Moyet greatly underappreciated. The lead singer of Mazzy Star is another great example. Men thought she was very attractive, despite being quite plain looking.

                    Grace still looked good in her 40s which is about all you can reasonably ask of a woman. They generally don’t age well. A few miracles of modern medicine may have erroneously given the impression that they can. To be fair, the “advances” in that field are getting better all the time.

                FWIW – my take is that Hope Sandoval is extremely feminine looking and pretty.   Shyness and composure adds to it and the result is beauty, I think.

                Madonna’s talent was for spotting nascent fads. She got it right about half the time for about fifteen years. That’s freakish skill level and endurance, for that kind of job.
She did have some good songs, and even when they weren’t good you could tell it was her singing them. People used to like that. I’ve only knowingly heard one Taylor Swift song, but I’ve probably heard fifty. She’s not a “personality.”
Kanye will be the last of those, probably.

                    She was also one of pop culture’s greatest self-promoters. To a pathological level.
As for her music, it never did anything for me. Much better stuff to listen to in the 80s than Madonna. That said, compared to today’s ghastly dreck, she was a ruddy spandex-wearing Beethoven.

            I would throw Ann &amp; Nancy Wilson of Heart, as well as Pat Benatar in that mix as well. I saw Hearts induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a few years ago where they performed “Crazy on you” and Ann still has an amazing set of pipes. She belted out that chorus like it was 1975 all over again.

            I couldn’t tell you the name of one of her songs – or even what her voice sounds like, because I don’t listen to the radio (never have).  She is fairly slender and blonde.  I wouldn’t call her her beautiful, but perhaps ‘cute.’  But the fandom is nuts, just like anything that is majority female.  Any man who permits his wife and/or daughter to go to a Swift concert has surrendered his balls.  That’s the root of the problem – women without the constraint and wisdom of men destroy everything.

            Melissa:“The best thing she could do is marry that nfl player (the white guy) and have lots of kids.“Melissa, it’s April 3, 2025, and Taylor Swift was born onDecember 13, 1989.She’ll be 36 in a few months.In theory, she could maybe have children at the ages of 36, 38 and 40, for a total of three, but it would be a very very long shot. [And that’s assuming that Tay-Tay is not in fact actually a Tranny herself.]But if she’s been on Birth Control Pills [or similar] for the last 25 years, then it would be very very very difficult for her to have her first child at the age of 37 [and it would be vanishingly unlikely for her to have two more children after that].Z-Man:‘Whenever Taylor Swift comes up with my buddies, we always say something like, “There is some strangely off-putting about her.”‘I’m telling you, it’s the Lady MacBeth Syndrome.Your buddies’ instincts can sense Taylor Swift’s desire to psychologically castrate males such as yourbuddies.[And, again, that’s assuming that Tay-Tay is not in fact actually a Tranny herself.]

                I had on ex describe my eyes as some unique shade of blue that was so subtle that I can never remember the name.
Then she closed her eyes and asked me what color her eyes were. I said that I was pretty sure that they weren’t brown.
She opened her eyes and I saw her blue eyes roll at my male cluelessness.
To support mmack’s point, I could have described her body in exacting detail.  I still can and it’s a great memory

            I remember there was an eye-tracking study released a while back. People were shown full body pictures of the opposite sex and a device tracked where their eyes moved.Men overwhelmingly looked at the eyes first, cheeks and lips, then tracked down to the hips/thighs and finally breasts. The longest gaze was held around the face of the woman.Women tracked as quickly looking at the eyes and top of the forehead, then lingered on shoulders chest and arms.It sort of makes sense. The face is a good indicator of female health for breeding purposes. Clear eyed, rosey cheeks and lips indicate good health and youthful fertility. Women’s makeup focuses on enhancing this. A quick glance at the hips also follows suit. A man may be looking at the eyes for health and perhaps the color doesnt figure into the initial calculation so is easily forgotten.For women, the quick glance at the eyes and forehead sums up the aggression/friendliness and height. The lingering on chest, shoulders and arms rates physical ability to protect her eggs.Obviously we aren’t simple mammals and can develop a desire for traits we prefer. Conversely, our first instinct is pretty innate. I just find it humorous that while men are often portrayed as being voracious about women’s bodies, it was the women that focused on male bodies and the men that spent the longest time looking at a woman’s face.

                I used to watch the eyes of women at work when someone new entered the conference room. If it was a man, they followed the same quick triangulation – face – crotch – ring finger. Repeat. If it was a woman, it went face – boobs – hips/butt (depending on viewing angle). Always a rapid-fire three-point assessment, done in a flash. Every woman, every time.

            So a somewhat relevant thing related to this… I’m in Eastern Europe and have been here for a while. One of the main reasons for this is that every 3rd woman I see on the street or on dating apps has blue or green eyes, with a healthy amount of hazel and gray in the mix too.In the US in maybe 1970s or so you possibly also find this. But in recent decades? It’s a sea of mystery meat. I look on the streets of major cities and I was in -many- of them 2 summers ago and on dating apps. The sea is muddy brown. Brown eyes, brown skin, brown hair in varying shades with the occasional blond / redhead with blue or green eyes throw in the mix. They KNOW they are rare, so their entitlement is at insane levels. These may be women who are not even conventionally attractive but in a muddy brown sludge they stand out.Here? I’m also in a sea and the color of the water is predominantly blue and green. I’m like a kid in a candy store here because of this. Do I look at the rest of the the assets? Yes, of course. But being surrounded by blondes, redheads, and light brown brunettes with light “European only” eyes is just such a wonderful part of my experience here. It makes the insane amount of time, effort, and expense it took me to get here partly worthwhile.This is an -ideal- place to go wife or girlfriend hunting. The poz hasn’t totally poisoned this place. YET… but the rootless cosmopolitan never tires and never sleeps. They’ve already dealt a killing blow to UK, Germany, and France so they will change their targets soon enough. But I sound the warning here to everyone I meet about their fate should they embrace “Western values”.

                    The language barrier is not as steep as you may imagine bro. English proficiency esp. in major cities isquitehigh so you can have complex conversations. Village girls? Yeah… though they are -ideal- candidates I simply don’t have the skill yet to chat them up in a deep way.So for the English speakers vax is definitely WAY lower here. In fact, if you sort of scroll the various dating profiles on apps ‘unvaccinated’ occurs at a very high rate compared to the US sheeple. I couldn’t give you exact #s but certainly far lower than the NPC wahmen of the West.Big pharma in general is frowned upon here so vaxx falls directly into that bucket. Pill popping and pharma interventions are not a thing in this part of the world. Only Germans like popping pills as much as Americanos.

                        He suffers from something that plagues a lot of child stars and people who got cast young. Many of them were picked because they were cute kids. The cherubic face and exaggerated features that make somebody a cute kid don’t typically look good on adults, particularly men. Most men grow into their faces, but a lot of child stars were older than the roles they were cast for and specifically selected because they had features like a younger kid because older kids are easier to direct and work with.

        I’m a father of two 20 something females so that stuff was on in our house when they where young.  I hate it, but it is catchy in a brain rot sort of way.  While she is starting to show the miles, she’s better than a mid IMO.  “Pretty, white girl next door types” are few and far between these days.

                This is an error. Attainable to whom? No one is the answer, because males find her bland and females are not, in the main, lesbians. Here relative blandness appeals to females because she is non-threatening, but gives them hope that regular looking gals can get a lot of attention. The fact that her most noteworthy feature is her eyes is the topper.

                    I’m a female who grew up in the late 50s-early 60s era, loved Rock ‘n’ Roll from Elvis and Little Richard onward, but I don’t know if I’ve ever actually heard a Taylor Swift song. She’s been around for ages, but the recent phenom of the “Eras” tour is something I noticed because my teenaged granddaughter and her mother traveled to another state to see one of the concerts, enjoying themselves thoroughly.I disagree about her eyes being a noteworthy feature; yes, they’re a pretty blue with a tweak of eyeliner, but to me what is important — and different about her face is that Taylor wears a bright, clear RED lipstick on her lips, at least in every picture I’ve seen of her. It’s a more “normal,” dare I say “wholesome,” look compared to the witchy makeup of Madonna, and the nasty tattooed fat girls dressed in black who I see waddling around Walmart.So Taylor is unique in the annals of popular music female stars, in my opinion. Starting in the early 60s, girls started wearing chalky pink “frosted” metallic hues on their lips. The Return of Red is what sets Taylor Swift’s appearance apart from the others and it gives her face real personality that you can see when she’s cheering Travis on from the owner’s suite in Kansas City.

                        Sorry, but bright red lipstick screams “Old lady” to me.  It’s what women wore in the 1940s and 1950s.  I find it garish.  It’s pretty pathetic that a lack of tattoos is so notable these days.  And a woman who’s almost 40 with no husband or children is not ‘wholesome.’

        Being a rock musician in my free time, almost everyone in my, and my wife’s, circle can’t stand Taylor swift.  To me she is just yet another whining, man hating woman who is claiming victim status. I’m so sick of that crap, it is nauseating.  Some music publication ranked her in the top ten of the world’s greatest guitarists.  Absolutely embarrassing.

                Assuming somebody who grew up in the affluent suburbs of Reading, Pennsylvania could be “country.” There are definitely places in the sticks in PA where the stars and bars fly freely. Wyomissing ain’t one of them. Given her proximity to Reading, she’d have been more authentic starting a mariachi outfit.

            It’s been a joke for some 15 years running that Swift should release an album titled “Maybe I’m the Problem” given that most of her hits have been about how things didn’t pan out with various people in her love life.

        Swift is a corporate product of our feminist cultures. (Very) mildly talented, but backed by transnationals and the youngish women who have dominated America and the West for half-a-century and counting.The corporatized NFL promoted her endlessly not because of merit, but because she’s an outstanding mass-psych tool for the continued Management of U.S. and Western citizenry.What better weapon to use against already pozzed and gelded Anglo men, shoehorning her into NFL broadcasts to remind us that though we have football, Big Sister in her Luxury Box rules over us all.  Princess and her Retinue, looking down benevolently on the Little People.In the Fifties and Sixties, Swift’s puerile fembot screechings wouldn’t even have cracked the Top 100 — way back when merit was still a factor in songwriting and performance. She is an avatar of feminized, dying Western societies.

        It’s not just pop music that is dying, but all types of music.  In the attached link, Rick Beato explores Zman’s point in further detail.  The short version is that technology has made music too easy to make and streaming platforms have made music too easy to consume.

            I think the AI revolution stops at the music business because there remains a social proof component to pop music, but there is no reason that someone could not create an AI pop music generator that is crowdsourced. People create accounts, create music they like and the robots then recommend what others have created based on your data.
Robot Tay Tay could become huge within such a system, but much dater and cheaper than in the analog world.

                That does exist. I don’t remember what it’s called, though I’ve heard it said a hundred times. (I’m bad at being advertised to.) People mostly use it to make novelty songs, algorithmic background music (a many-decades-old thing already), and fake artists to scam Spotify.Japan has had pop stars who don’t really exist for a long time. Hatsune Miku is the Elvis of that sort of thing. Maybe because they’re used to superior fakery, they haven’t taken to “AI” for music. They do like using a chatbot as half of a comedy duo, the real person paired with a simulated version, taking turns being stupid.American music is like every other American business. Management is using chatbots to “correct,” discipline, and disempower workers. What it’s replaced isn’t people or product but management fallibility.Itjudges you, and your arguments against its perfect objectivity are emotional—dangerously so, if you insist on them.

            Beato is spot on with his points. People place little to no value on anything that has been reduced to a base commodity.
There are good YouTube vids about how awful an idea reducing everything to content is.
Additionally, slop is everywhere now.
I wonder what’s going to happen when the LLMs will have nothing to train on save for an endless cycle of slop.

        There is what I call a predictable sterility now that the financialization of this country has extended to pop music, movies, TV and even sports. In the good old days, the Wall Street pirates were content to gamble on investments that often wouldn’t pay off, especially with technology and balance big losses with bigger wins.Now, there is this “play it safe” mentality that is likely due to the end of America’s frontier spirit. Like with utilities or treasury bonds, they seek a stable, predictable return on their investment.That’s why music is now so sterile. Thanks to the atomization of the music industry due to filesharing, they can’t take a chance with a new artist that might not make it big. That’s why there are no bands anymore. Solo artists are far easier to control. They have a formula and likely we’ll see AI spit out pop tunes that are guaranteed to sell to a public with the attention span of a gnat. Pop music is like a Snickers bar. The first bite or so might be delicious, but then the sticky, gross sweetness overwhelms you and it becomes repellant.It’s in movies too. The only movies made are big summer tentpoles that some formula has decreed will return the massive grosses for the investors. The problem is the formula is so soul-sucking that many of these “can’t miss” movies flop because they’re filled with the usual race-swapping and girl boss nonsense.In sports, the curse of statistical analyst has made baseball into a game of 100 mph pitchers who blow their elbows out multiple times and get to live with a cadaver’s ligament in their elbow and home runs. Everything else is not statistically valuable. It’s the ultimate moneyball approach.No one cares if your hitter strikes out 5 times a night and hits a home run once. Average is meaningless in this age. The art of lancing a line drive through a gap is dead, especially since those same line drives are erased by the statistically-driven defensive shifts in the infield and outfield.Same with hoops. No more mid-range jumpers (a specialty of mine). Just 3-pointers, dunks and layups. It makes more sense on the balance sheet. But it makes it boring.I can’t stand watching sports because of it. The human element, like with pop music, has been autotuned out of it and we’re all poorer for it.

        There’s a much simpler answer to Taylor Swift’s success and lack of drama: Talent, IQ, Breeding. Her dad is a hedge fund manager, for God’s sake. He’s no dummy and you’ve got to figure he didn’t marry a dummy either. Two bright people pooped out a bright kid and know a lot of other bright people who got the business side of Taylor Swift right.But it takes more than bright. It also takes some assertiveness and not letting grass grow under your feet. Again, we go back to the successful traits to be a hedge fund manager. I’m sure her dad isn’t a wallflower and I’m sure she inherited and learned a lot.There are a lot of rumors about Taylor Smith being a lesbian, I would gather because she is unmarried. Or, who knows, maybe they are true. Or, maybe she’s just in an industry full of scum and she knows better than to poop out babies with 99.9% of the people she encounters in the entertainment industry. Again, breeding, brains and upbringing. Or maybe she’s just destined to be a cat lady.I admire her, actually. She’s made millions in that industry and she’s been able to keep her arms length distance from the people in it and has been able to keep herself from wallowing in the gutter with them. She hasn’t had to resort to skankifying herself like Madonna or Britney Spears.In a way, she reminds me a little bit of Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer Aniston is also an average looking woman whose face is concealed by very stylish hair and what is a pretty good body especially for somebody her age. Otherwise, Jennifer’s about a five or a six.By the way, I think you were too generous with Taylor. She’s no seven. I’d give her a six.

                I just can’t get over the fact that her hair styles always cover her face. I think she’s kind of got a weird face when you see the hair pulled back. But give her credit as well for not turning herself into a skank to get attention.

                My point is still that she came from an well-off family, so it’s likely she also had access to the tools that made her successful and somewhat normal, not to mention that she doesn’t want to make you take a shower like after seeing a Madonna video.

        Interesting post today.
The only thing I can think of to comment on is that female celebrities tend to age poorly. It may be the propensity of females to go to plastic surgery as they age. (For an example of plastic surgery going horribly wrong, look no further than Laura Flynn Boyle. A truly beautiful young woman who looks like her face melted). I wonder who will take Swifts place.

            When I do dare to look back upon Sodom and Gomorra, I see that many teen and twenty something women are getting plastic surgery. It is sad.It is Noah Yuval Harari’s world now. The Nordics understood the dangers of men being anally penetrated. A darkness is unleashed and Harari is the poster child for it. I can see that pillow biting demon cackling as he watches young women mutilating themselves.We confront an evil that may have no precedent. It is capricious and sadistic and worse, has not a small scale but a global scale that it can prey upon. It seems the cults of the 70s were just a very minor prelude to the Harari cults that are now emerging.

Good comment and you are, sadly, correct.
This particular evil, the Feminine Unleashed, has endless precedents in the ancient world. But, as you note, the malevolence now is GLOBAL, and that IS unprecedented . . . dispersed through the world largely by Amerika.
. . . often FORCED on the world by Amerika. It ain’t a nation ‘under God’, put it that way.

            I’d go with “rock star” for Morrissey, because he makes so many people so angry. Among the many, many millions who think Taylor Swift sucks, almost nobody wants to kill her. Morrissey’s demise will cause dancing in the press. That’s been true for forty years. (“Panic” caused the first annual wave of the media calling him a nazi, if I remember right.) Mere pop stars can’thold a crowdlike that.

        For all the hoopla over Taylor Swift, I literally couldn’t name or identify a single one of her songs if you offered me a million bucks to do it right now.
I only know of her in an epiphenomenal sense from following the media, which refers to her frequently.
It is said that she started out as a country musician, and I have listened to a lot of country, but never any Taylor Swift.
She may very well be talented, but from my vantage point she seems very manufactured and synthetic.

            With all due respect Bad Man, I don’t understand why a man could like a female singer, beyond admiring her looks. Females have different lifeways. I have never heard a song by one that connects with me.

                        She was one of my favorites.  Not a beautiful girl, kinda cute in a tomboy way, but authentically talented.  ‘Back on the Chain Gang’ is perhaps the best song ever written about the elite separating the male and the female for their selfish, nefarious purposes.

                I find I cannot appreciate supposed great female songwriters. Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush, the Fleetwood Mac chicks…
I can enjoy the music but I am conscious that I can’t feel what they are expressing. It all seems so distant and often a bit annoying, like they’re nagging me or bitching at me.
It may be a personal failing of mine, but I guess that if most men were honest they would agree with me. Men can’t really feel women’s art.
Can women feel what men express in lyrics and songs?

Said zip about ‘songwriting’ … and if you cannot appreciate the female VOICE … not studio created ‘sound’ … you can cut out a lot of music from classical on forward.
Maybe as Lita Ford sang you need to go “back to the cave” …

                        If Joni’s talent was so unremarkable then why did she get some of the finest jazz musicians to collaborate with her repeated;y? Jaco Pastorius, Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock. She went from from folk to jazz and wrote songs with unusual chord changes and guitar tunings.
She has not aged well and has suffered from Morgellon’s Disease, which may or may not be real.

                        Seriously?  That’s interesting, because I’d rather listen to a man.  I enjoy plenty of songs by Blondie or even Carlie Simon, and even a few female opera singers.  But on the whole I prefer male voices.

        The observation about the concert goers experiencing the act through their phones is the one I find most concerning. It’s not just younger people who are doing this either. My lump of a brother in his mid-60’s literally spends all day, every day, looking at his phone. If the matrix  was trying to turn humans into automatons what would they be doing different? At some point many people will decide they’d rather be plugged into an alternate, but fake, reality and never come out. They would not take the red pill. Given the advances in AI and human-machine interfaces, that point might be closer than you think.Also maybe the reason we find Tay Tay somewhat unsettling is because she’s just an artificial construct of the machine. She’s from the uncanny valley.

        Brilliant piece. You have taken arguably the most banal topic imaginable and used it to masterfully illustrate how profound a change to everyday life AI portends to be. Yes, Tay-Tay is Karen’s avatar, and, yes, technology can and probably will allow her to endure as long as her wine aunt audience is sentient. New and real music will be confined to small venues, which will serve as salons and be under constant State surveillance due to potential subversion. The future is gray and bleak and those spots will be flickering lights in the darkness.

        She was pretty cute in a girl next door way fifteen years ago and had a couple of catchy tunes (my wife and some nieces liked her).  But I’ve got so say, I don’t get the mega stardom and from what little I hear these days, she’s getting a bit more annoying and is looking more and more to be a cat lady spinster in the making.

        The Technology (tools or literally the logic of tools) didn’t destroy a societal consensus that had not existed for 30 years prior to smart phones and the Internet being a daily thing.  The societal consensus was destroyed in the 1960s.Given the 60s creed of Hedonistic Nihilism no tool made it worse.

            Agreed. The AI process that Z described has been in existence for a long time. I recently deleted a long diatribe describing an insider’s view of how this has worked since the 90s.It is already a base formula. The only difference now is human assembly will be replaced with total digital assembly. Techno is merely a moron digitally stitching together moronic loops and samples. They turn knobs with a gritty look on their face and the audience pretends that they are watching a master at work.Better that all that pretense is dispensed with and the machine do what should be beneath any human with an ounce of dignity.The world will bifurcate. You will know your friends and enemies by those who think AI generated, “art”, is amazing and those who recoil in horror at it.Tay Tay Harari and The Pillow Biters are the new Popes of Avignon and there is no Palestrina coming to rescue great music.

                The difference is the formula created by and executed by humans is riddled with potential errors and bias. The AI model can eliminate the errors and bias, in addition to creating the work in minutes and tweaking it on the fly as it processes responses.

                    I recall seeing an analysis of how auto-tune works.  Auto-tune is a machine that can bend off-key notes to the nearest correct note.  Someone played a Pavarotti recording on auto-tune, and you could see him slightly missing notes, albeit not by enough for the human ear to pick up.  They then played a Michael Buble recording, and every note was precisely correct, which is impossible.  If you can artificially make every note perfect, then it becomes less about talent, and more about having some gimmick that gets attention.

                    So much of what the human was doing in some cases was almost nothing that it may not make a difference.You alluded to where AI can and will take it. That is a totally customized and personalized Tay Tay. It may be that Tay Tay in the future is a billion or more Taylored (pun intended), AGI avatars of each of the billion people’s projections. Already at concerts everyone has their phone up filming the event instead of being present at it. Why? They want to film it to show they were there. The vanity/insecurity is far more powerful than the desire to be present – to truly be there.I can imagine a day where one person thinks they are a Tay Tay fan and they are really being projected Lizzo while another is being projected Celine Dion.

                    You’re putting me in mind of the Primarch Fulgrim inWarhammer 40,000. He was obsessively frustrated by the fact that, as a literal demigod, his artworks contained no human errors and thus no spark of life.

        few swift tidbits.  according to CDAN gossip site, she is a friend of dorothy.  and that ties into her eyes, as gay people often have a little something different going on there.she doesn’t write all of her own songs.  not sure if she wrote the hits or not.madonna used to fill this role for the post-wall crowd, but she is all gross now, plus no one wants to be reminded we all get old.her current BF is funny AF but not intentionally.  seems and looks genuinely dim witted.she was booed heartily at the super bowl, when they showed her on the big tv screen.  seems like that is a good measure of her popularity outside her core audience.she has no grace of movement at all and dances like a spastic monkey, stomping around and doing all manner of nonsense.and finally, i have had better than her, but that is a pretty low bar.

        I just assumed that Swift’s popularity was due to a lack of competition and the collapse of the music industry.
When I was a teenager, girl acts included Fleetwood Mac (Nicks &amp; McVeigh), Pat Benetar, Till Tuesday, the Go Go’s, Cyndi Lauper, and a hundred others.  Now I can’t name an act under 40.

        Regarding eyes and makeup, it has been my observation that women who wear too much eye makeup are almost always mentally unbalanced. (More so than the average woman.) If you’re in the market for a dame, this is a good thing to know.
As to Z’s thesis about artificial and auto-generated pop musicians, all I can say is that reality, or meta-reality, becomes ickier with every passing month.

        Re: AI art, the art is in the mistakes, the little mistakes. These are mysterious things. I don’t see science and tech reproducing them, don’t even think they’re capable of it. I’ve been told, of course and in so many words, this is superstition, but I’ll never buy it, because we’re not living in Utopia— obviously it’s not all worked out. We just need more time to perfect it, right? More data. True X has never been tried. LOL.

            Any style or artist or whatever canalmostbe replicated, because anything isalmostcalculable.The gap between Prince and “AI” Prince (for example) can be narrowed by making calculations in greater bulk, more finely examining Prince and more nearly approximating him. But the gap can’t be closed, because artists are, to use Rand’s extremely weird term,whim-worshippers. If they’re any good, that’s their whole job. Given Prince’s prior albums, the most exhaustive personal biography, etc., could any bot generateParade? Not even close. I mean, try it.You can’treallyget to “AI” to invent anything. In theabsolute absenceof a thing—it’s nowhere in its data and nowhere in your mind—how do you tell it what to do? “All art is derivative of prior art and no invention or idea is likenothing else before, so—” Right.Show your prompt.Give your bot all of Duchamp’s art except“Nude Descending a Staircase”and have it make “Nude Descending a Staircase”—without telling it to make something called“Nude Descending a Staircase,” because no one has ever heard of such a thing.Actual solution to this problem: People can be taught not to value anything interesting, and forbidden from making anything interesting themselves. That is the aim of “tech.”

        Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter (Swift’s replacement) have also mastered “girl hot.” Women have never really enjoyed wearing clothes so you’ll see ALL the time a woman hold up a mass of strings and squee about how it’s sooo cute.This baffles men becuase, well it’s the most slutty thing they’ve ever seen, but women seem baffled that men will take it that way. See the entire subcontinent of India.Enter “Girl Hot”. Swift and Carpenter both prance around half naked, Carpenter even mimes sex acts on stage, and yet asks most men and they just…. don’t find them attractive. He’ll, Carpenter looks WAY better as a brunette but insists on a purposely bad, blond dye job. This is becuase they have mastered the ability to wear clothes that are soooo cute and to act completely debauched, but completely asexual.

        There’s a fair amount of creepy ass meme culture around her. Over the holidays my young 20-something’s texted me this:https://youtu.be/SLGxJfMCCsQ?feature=sharedSo the kids seem to have caught onto who is in the fan base and how that fan base responds to criticism of their leader…Although I think AI will wreak a lot of havoc, I think also we’ll see a backlash against it in the form of supporting actual artists. Not just pop music, but illustrators, sculptors, painters, woodworkers, etc. Once ANYTHING can be made by a machine, its value plummets to zero.My daughter is a gifted painter. On a planet where you can buy just about any picture you want at next to no price, I watch how people marvel at what she can do with a paintbrush. A friend of mine’s son is also a talented artist. And his human-made art has found a following and people are willing to pay for things made by a human hand. I think humanity will have legs and craftsmen with genuine skill will still be valued.Until the robot overlords decide to kill us all, anyway.

        I think the one thing this thread proves is that there’s no accounting for taste.That said, those who confess that they’ve never heard a TS song or couldn’t name one, might want to at least give her a listen before judging her. By my lights, her work has three “eras,” if you will: the first three albums comprise her country/pop origins, the middle four have some fun arena rock songs and some dabblings in hip-hop (my least fave), the latest four migrated into something I’m not sure how to name. “Atmospheric” comes to mind, though I acknowledge that’s pretty vague.Much of what I appreciate about the middle and late albums is their production values— whatever you think of Taylor, it’s hard to deny that she knows how to pick professional studio people to help out.i’m 72 years old, played in more cover rock bands than I can remember in the 70s and 80s, went to college on a classical guitar scholarship where I studied music theory and history, and studied violin for four years, so I know a bit of what I’m talking about.

                To each his own, Zaphod. Over the last four decades or so I’ve listened to countless hours of Lara St. John, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Leila Josefowitz, Midori, and I don’t know how many other female violin virtuosi, yet my horizons are wide enough that I can enjoy a few of TS‘s tunes, too.I like steak and lobster but once in a while, I enjoy a big Mac as well. That said, thanks for the heads up about Lina tur Bonet. I’ll be sure to check her out.

        “Soon, maybe even now, music executives can ask a couple of DOGE kids to create a pop star maker… Instead of hiring actors to play the part, like the boy band producers did in the last century, the music execs will ask their AI engineers to create them.”This was already done in Deus Ex 2. A good game sunk by impossible expectations, one of the “characters” was a female pop music star who had holographic kiosks in various locations where fans and the PC could interact with an AI version of her.The AI was operated by the Intelligence Community because wheezy fanboys would tell ‘her’ anything she asked about. It was great. Her holograms gave you sidequests to spy on people while dancing like an OnlyFans model scratching at fleas.As cynically prophetic as any Deus Ex 1 idea.

        This is a good explanation of the Tay Tay phenomenon and where it is going. I also think its because there is so little new music worth listening to that she has little competition, at least among “white” music. Tay Tay has the Swifties and Beyonce has the Beahive.

            Hendrix is a great topic here. His live shows were unlistenable. Pots and pans crashing down a long staircase sounds better. But, his audience was on drugs, so they did not care. His studio work was made possible by the technology of the age. In a way, Hendrix was an early example of the divergence between played music and created music.

                You are wrong here. Yeah, some was crap. But part of the live issue was the tech was simply not there for concerts of this size. Hendrix, when on, was incredible – live. His Maui set is, recording quality aside, an excellent example of how good he was on an average concert. The Beatles, undeniably one of the tightest rock bands of their era, sounded poor live, as well. Though the tech advanced greatly during the 60s, it was still anemic compared to the 70s.

                    Eloi is correct on all points. I add that Hendrix was evolving into a bona-fide “composer”: he was heading maybe not toward Duke Ellington, but perhaps toward Stevie Wonder?

                    The Beatles hung it up for live performances in 1966 because they couldn’t hear themselves over the screaming girls and the PA and monitor technology was way too primitive to compensate. In the 70’s McCartney had a good run with Wings

                        Yes, I know. That is my point about why Hendrix did not sound good, either. The tech was not there to replicate what one could do in clubs. As a further note, The Beatles would often wave at the crowd to cover up spotty parts that they could not reproduce live, purposefully obfuscating their sound. The tech evolved rapidly with wedge monitors and stacks

                Agreed. The most over rated guitarist who is so far inferior to so many other guitarists of his time and all time. We know why he is so highly lauded.
Pots and pans crashing down a long staircase is the best review of Hendrix I have ever heard.

                    I have to agree.  When I was a young ardent hippie I tried so hard to like Hendrix.  I had a big poster of him on my wall.
It just wouldn’t take.  Eventually I just had to admit to myself that I didn’t really care for most of his stuff.
He definitely was a very creative guitarist, but very sloppy, and overrated.

                                I like some of Cohen’s songs, when sung by others.  I find his voice distracting, but he sure writes some gorgeous melodies.  Chelsea Hotel is a marvelous tune about a sordid event.
I was a guitarist and singer and yes, a big Bobfan.  Covered him a lot.  Guess I’m a bundle of contradictions like most folks, pretty wild for a Christian and a bit too rock n rolly for a good conservative, perhaps. Yeah it’s true that rock often is a degenerate form.  I am a long way from perfect that’s for sure.

                Hendrix was just a wall of discordant, out of tune noise. Not a genius. And for that matter, Jim Morrison’s “poetry” was obscene doggerel.Gently they stir, gently rise.The dead are newborn awakeningWith ravaged limbs and wet souls,Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement.Who called these dead to dance?Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand?Was it the wilderness children?Was it the ghost god himself, stuttering, cheering, chatting blindly?I called you up to anoint the earth.I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin.I called to wish you well,To glory in self like a new monster.And now I call on you to pray.

                    Morrison is crap – the Doors are pretty lousy. I don’t think anyone who actually learns to play Hendrix will say he is sloppy. Listen to the actual guitar in Bold As Love. That is incredibly technical and extremely well-played.To be clear, I don’t care much for Hendrix’s songs. But his playing, at its best, was extremely proficient and thoughtful. He is far from my favorite guitarist, but your flippant dismissal is simply wrong.

                        Page was as sloppy as Hendrix, but there was a difference.
I guess my white brain wants a composition like Kashmir or Celebration Day, which Hendrix couldn’t deliver.
On the other hand, Hendrix had an improvisational genius that Page had to a lesser degree.
I think that the great black musicians often had an improvisational genius where they were lacking in composition. James Brown’s compositions were trivial but I love his energy.  Maybe Miles Davis as well.

                            I know The Doors’ hits, and that is it, so I cannot comment further. I cannot stand Kiedis, but Frusciante is one of the reasons I first picked up guitar; I love his playing on BSSM and Californication. Other than that, not much care.

                        He was at best a decent rhythm player, but playing the most stock chords and derived licks.
The master can’t be topped. Listen to Stevie Ray Vaughn cover Hendrix. The vocals and playing are light years beyond what Hendrix ever could do. It was a lot of hype by people hungry for signs of rebellion and smashing the existing order.
A far better musician was Prince – leagues beyond as a song writer and a guitar player. Even then, listen to a true master cover Prince and play circles around him:

                            I know SRV. I never heard him play a bum note. I could also say that SRV could not play Jeff Beck. Yes, SRV knew more than Hendrix. But what he knew was Hendrix.

                        It’s not bad, but his tone is not the best. He did inspire Stevie Ray Vaughn, whose tone was the work of God and his fingers, so he’s not all bad. But if you have the greatest playing and the songs are absolute trash, what’s the point? See Yngie Malmsteen.
Lindsey Buckingham said as much about Van Halen. While I disagree with his view on VH, especially the DLR era, it is a solid criticism of these virtuosos who are great players in service of mediocre music.

                            I agree. But people saying Hendrix is mediocre dont play or know. For the record, I spent about two months getting down Never Going Back Again a long time ago, so this is not out of Hendrix prejudice – I generally dont care for him at all. But I play, I have a good ear, and I hear that term sloppy and people do not know what they are talking about. He was not sloppy at all. His dynamics and his solos are exceptionally good. And, yes, I dont really care for VH, either.
