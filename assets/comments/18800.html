            Well, it would mean no Olympic gold medals for the USA basketball team and track &amp; field sprint and jumping events.  But other than that I can’t think of any other negative consequences.

                Football would be slower.  Fewer player-games would be lost to injury.  There’d be fewer WR divas, and less taunting overall.  End zone celebrations would mostly be the player flipping the ball to the official.

                    It wouldn’t necessarily be slower.
There might be more Christian Mccaffreys, Jordy Nelsons, Mac Speedies, Elroy “Crazy Leg” Hirshes, Don Hutsons, Lance Alworths, Wes Welkers, and Golden Richards playing.

                        I think the game, especially at the pro level, selects for speed.  There are fast white guys, sure, but proportionally more fast black guys.  But fewer black guys will play hurt.

                Our host often brings up the importance of asking what is good for our people as opposed to say our economy.Bringing home gold is nice, but not nearly as nice as fielding a cohesive team that reflects our people.In my experience with basketball the max number of blacks is one.As soon as there are two, the ‘culture’ immediately descends into street ball. Word gets out. The next week there are six. By week 4 most of the white guys stay home.Sure we have nicer courts, rims with actual nets that manage to not steal themselves. But why do they come? Why drive over to a court full of racists and oppressors when you have courts and fellow black players aplenty?Because we are good players. We run clean games with order and fairness and inclusivity. We play team ball with defence, passing, and pick and roll plays.So they come. It becomes their game, their court, their rules. And so we go find a new court.Conversely, when I was young I regularly played in the street games and was often the only white or one of a select few they allowed to play. Your desire to play, your respect for the rules, the game, etc were irrelevant.You had to be good. More importantly, you had to walk the line between standing up for yourself against racism, bad calls, and minor physical abuse and being too white and getting beat down and disinvited to the fun.For them the basketball was just one more display of the ‘culture’. There is no sake of the sport.This ‘culture’ of basketball is no longer ours. Its full ghetto. If we cared less about winning at all costs and more about the experience of building a team that reflects our culture, we would be happier engaging in these sorts of things.Also, i think we could easily field a team of all whites and medal at the games.This reliance on black bodies for ‘real’ sport and its mythology of superiority is embarrassing.And it fails to factor in how many great future talents do not enter – or exit like I did, when the black mercenary culture of sports becomes commonplace.A friend used to be a principal at an all boys catholic high school. The cadre of “scholarship” students represented the bulk of the basketball and football team. It was also the bulk of violence, disruption,  and intimidation of other students.The thing is, they were always good at sports with all white kids. Somewhere something changed. I don’t think it was that white kids suddenly got less athletic.

                    Steve Sailer has noted, and I think he’s right, that a lot of young tall white kids (around 6-5 or so) choose to play baseball, specifically pitcher, where height is an advantage, instead of basketball.

                        I recently looked up the racial mix in MLB, and turns out it’s about the same as for the U.S. at large — but the black component peaked a couple decades back, and is still dropping. Fact is baseball is a high-IQ sport, requiring reaction times to match (“game of inches” is no exaggeration, and neural response time parallels IQ), and that selects against the majority of the vibrant. Also, it’s a self-sacrifice sport. which doesn’t attract the self-aggrandizing diverse.It’s interesting to watch black vs white players after committing an error. The white guy is chagrined and wears an expression of “next time I’ll do better.” The black guy’s expression is not-my-fault and  “Whatchoo lookin’ at??”

                    Well done, Screwtape.As a sixth grader, in a Pop Warner game, I ran for about 150 yards and scored 4 touchdowns.That night, after dinner, and after he had had a couple of pops, my father gave me what he, no doubt, intended as sage advice:“Don’t get a big head.  You are not going to be playing in the NFL.  The black kids will beat you out.”This was 1974, when the majority of NFL players were white.My father was then 43 years old.  Somewhere along the line, had had bought the mythology that negroes are superior athletes.

                    Screw tape, great observation.  I had a similar experience where I live with our (non-Black) vibrancy when son was in soccer league.  The coach scheduled a game against a Hispanic team from the other side of town on “their” field.  The play was like night and day from what we were used to.  Soccer turned into a full contact sport similar to football, which of course we were attempting to stay away from by joining a soccer league.Anyway, the Hispanic parents hooted and hollered and enjoyed every foul resulting in knock downs and players limping off of the field.  Fouls of course were not called often enough from my point of view.  My son said basically, he’d never play there again.  The coach, I am lead to understand, was informed in no subtle way he was not to schedule any more games with such “vibrant” teams.In case one thinks this is an oddball, one off thing—a few years later a similar occurrence happened to my daughter when she played in youth soccer.  This time the wife was involved and the coach—a Hispanic at that—was called on the carpet and we stayed in our own side of town from there on.

                    Screwtape, I take issue with your assertion that multiple “Blacks” on a b ball team assures a descent into “street ball”. Of course I have the advantage of living in San Antonio, home of the least “street ball” team in the NBA. I can guarantee that, at least in San Antonio, there is no “I” in “team”. And yet they win. If memory serves, Tim Duncan has just as many rings as Kobe Bryant.

                        Bill, I never played in the NBA nor do I consume it so whatever the San Antonio franchise is up to is irrelevant to me.I have played basketball on three continents and in multiple states, urban, suburban, and rural. The dynamic is consistent. There is a very low tipping point in which the culture or spirit of the game changes based on its vibrancy.It has little to do with the passing and “team” ball you are getting at. Re read my comment. They come to play with us precisely for that reason. But they cannot leave their ghetto antics in their zip code and it always descends into something less than.It is also worth noting that while the raw athleticism and and jumping superiority are probably true in the extreme, it is not evident on the average.But when the game solves for those extremes, while tolerating other traits like low IQ and other illegal to notice behaviors, it may seem like those traits are what it takes to win, but at what cost?As that culture has taken over the game, the game has changed, including how rules are interpreted.How the average guard today takes his dribble would have been traveling 30 years ago. Same goes for the blatant initiation of contact in the paint, coupled with the feet shuffling and palming.The subtle erosion of such things is hard to see until one day you are the only one that keeps his hand atop the ball when changing direction.So yeah, if it is about pounding bodies and covering 25’ on a single dribble, and talking shit constantly, the Afros are gonna be better.We ceded the court just like everything else. In the end its just entertainment, but how many courts do we cede until we no longer have a venue to express our own culture?Eh, Basketball wasnt even my sport. So its not my racism talking. I played a white sport. Up through olympic development in my early 20’s. Luckily I got thru it before the quest for Gold caused the team to go full mercenary.Seems we are a suicidal people even in play.

                    Well zulus mature 2 years sooner than their white counterparts. So of course in the 12 to 14 year range they are going to have an advantage. I would say this spills over to issues of confidence among many other factors in a white boys particapation in sports. Oh yeah. White girls tend to mature about 2 years before white boys .at the same time the spear chuckers do. Think hard about that one.

                    If you want to bring basketball back to the way it used to be, just raise the net about 24″ or so.  Remembering that the when the guy developed the idea of basketball, people were typically 5’6″ or so tall.  Now you have guys who are at least a foot taller ruling the game.And yeah, the rest of your remarks are spot on – not that any good leftie would ever admit that…

                    I played some street ball myself (Rose Mofford Sports Complex in Phoenix, by Metrocenter), and my observations are:Most black players on the street ball level can’t go left, and most can’t shoot for shit from outside. I am tallish (6’6″ at the time), and every damned one of them thought they would be in the NBA if they were as tall as I was. They gave no thought to how the game changes as you get higher off the ground.The most fun I had was at Glendale community college, were a group of older players would play twice a week in the gym. Not nearly as much street ball garbage.No one knew how to feed the post, though, so I was mostly wasted. 😀

                Re: “bleached America” Olympic performance. About sprinting and jumping events I suspect that you are correct. As far as basketball goes, I recall that colleges like BYU and Indiana University (under coach Bobby Knight) used to put together rather competitive teams with all white or mostly white starting lineups well into the 1980s and 1990s.

                    There’s always been a lot of great white players in basketball.  But blacks do dominate.  Blacks of West African descent, on average, simply jump higher than whites and are quicker, although as with every endeavor there are exceptions.  Jumping high and being quick are extremely advantageous in basketball.For the sake of accuracy, Bobby Knight’s IU national championship teams had more starting black players than white players.  His undefeated ’76 NCAA championship team featured a starting lineup of Bobby Wilkinson, Quinn Buckner, Scott May, Kent Benson and Tom Abernethy.  Three of the five are black.  Knight’s ’81 championship team, led by Isiah Thomas (black), again three of five starters are black.  Knight’s IU team won again in ’87, where Steve Alford was the lone white starter, among four black starters.

                It’s hard for white kids whose parents (and themselves) have to work – to compete against black kids who do not and have all the benefits of affirmative action and all the other assorted welfare programs to benefit them.If I’m a white kid whose parents both have to work – to supply all of that money that disappears into the maw of the “black community” ( if I remember the numbers from that Vox Day article from a while back I think it was something on the order of $700k lifetime per black person)   – then that’s just that much less time that tall white kid’s parents have to spend encouraging his basketball prowess.Long story short:  black athletic prowess is subsidized.  Remove the damn subsidies – and I bet that tall white kids would win an occasional Olympic gold medal in basketball and track and field.Black athletes in this country are on a par with East German and Soviet “amateur” athletes from the USSR era.They’re state subsidized.And the state is subsidized by white people.Sisyphus should pull his head out of his ass and decide that pushing that rock is a fool’s errand…  sooner rather than later.

                Not really.  Having a professional musician class is only possible in advanced societies.  The talented 10th would never achieve much of anything in an African society because the talented 10th needs a functional society to nurture them into adults and to educate them.The smartest people to have ever lived were probably peasants who could not even read.  Without the surplus wealth of an advanced society, the exceptional person cannot be discovered and put to work.

                    SJWs always only look at one side of the ledger as if everything is only positives.  Even in the much more narrow category of “black music,” there is a benefit to be had, but there is also a large cost in the form of black rap.  The real question is, on net, is it better to have a society that has new music genres where the cost is other terrible music genres taking over the airwaves and all the other enormous costs of their presence?

                “Better” than what?  Schubert?  The Overture to “Don Giovanni”?  Black music has its moments and its fine qualities, sure; but it nearly utterly lacks a capacity for the sublime.  No capacity for magnificence, awe, terror, the celestial.Plus, it’s really just a sub-category of White music.  Created using White instruments, White tonality, White theory, White structures, White technology.  (Hip-hop is literally the first type of music ever which is completely impossible without recording technology and electronics.  There is no such thing as Black recording technology, or African electronics.)Black music is just White music with a much stronger sense of syncopation, and a more complex sense of rhythm.  If you syncopate a passage from the Brandenburg Concertos and put a tasty drum track under it, that is jazz.  If you syncopate Irish folk music, that is the blues.One grows tired of this fawning.  Sports would be fine with just White players.  And more enjoyable.  And less irritating.  Music without black participants would not all be Pat Boone.  That is nonsense.  Blacks can run fast, but they can’t build a stopwatch.  They can leap about and throw a rubber ball throw a hoop, but they can’t make the rubber ball.  Or the hoop.If we were to have a White civilization where the /only/ downside was, the track stars were a bit slower and the music was less oversexed and obnoxious, who would turn that down?

                    We would adjust to the differences.  Major league baseball, before 1947, was very popular.  The national pastime.  Basketball would be missing a lot of highlight reel dunks, but so what?  Football would be slowed down a bit, but that wouldn’t matter.  It would still be entertaining.
As for music, I doubt if any of us here is able to watch a Grammy Awards show lately.  The little bit I glimpsed seemed to be mostly black, black, blackety-black.

                    Black music (hiphop) without recording technology would be chants with drums, just like a. South African political rally now.Can you blame producers from taking advantage of gear from BanjoMart to make a 128 track souless moneymaking noise lacking melody and harmony, aimed at their savage audience?

While that may true (is jazz and blues “better” than Haydn, Beethoven, Sinatra, or Bill Monroe?) what have blacks done for us lately – 40 years of rap and hip hop?

            On the face of it, NO.  But consider nations like Sweden, Great Britain, etc.  They were homogeneous nations whose elite sold them out – forcing vibrancy on an eloi-like population that was happy to remain unarmed.
In the US, the omnipresence of vibrancy has been a good deterrent to gun control measures.

                    The US *seemed* set to do this, but there is a wall going up and public attitudes are shifting.  I wish it shifted sooner but it is running in the right direction.
Look, even with our elites selling us out we are better prepared to defend ourselves in a way other nations aren’t.  Their populations are toothless, here you can go online and order your own AR-15 for pete’s sake.

            Sports &amp; some contributions to music &amp; entertainment, vastly outweighed by the negatives. Slavery was a net-negative for Whites economically, “Blacks built America” is Tennessee Coates snake-oil.  Providing unskilled labor for Woke Capital and cannon-fodder for the Forever Wars aren’t  Black positives for White America either.  6 trillion dollars in “close The Gap” spending would have kept a lot of Whites off of welfare &amp; opiates since the Great Society.  Frankly, we’d probably be on Mars already.

            It’s a fair question, but it’s not so much the number of blacks, which has stayed relatively constant as a percentage over the decades, but the achievement gap, which has become a chasm in a technology society.  The difference between a white or black manual laborer is not that pronounced, and mostly cultural.  The gap between a white or black STEM worker is huge and genetic.  Whites are becoming a minority due to the brown flood over the southern border.  This also comes with an achievement gap, but not as pronounced as white/black.

                DLS.  The difference between White and Black not only increases, but the difference between Whites increases.  Charles Murray first broached this topic a decade ago in his book, “Coming Apart”.  He deliberately focused on Whites only rather than confound his study wrt race bias.Folks on the left side of the bell curve—White or Black—are being left behind in our new technological society and this is easily seen in tracing our wealth disparities across the decades.  As I’ve cited previously, the top 10% of the population (give or take a few % or so) own 80% of the wealth of the nation.  The rest of folk get to fight over the remaining 20%.  This shit is what starts revolutions.

            I say this with all seriousness: the music would suck. Have you heard native pop music in Russia or China or Finland? If you believe in race realism, the reality is that blacks are mother nature’s gift of groove. Imagine a world without Isaac Hayes or Marvin Gaye.

Not at all. I could happily live without “the groove” and “the funk” or whatever the hell they call it. And I’d be over the moon to be rap-free and hiphop-free.
Hmm. Let’s have a look at my playlist over the last few days:George Strait is on as I type this.Chris LeDoux, The Hu, Heilung, Vivaldi, Albinoni, Exit Eden, Nightwish, Johnny Cash, Celtic Woman, Enya, Loreena McKinnett, Mark Chestnutt, Bob Seger, Altan, Skald, Sabaton, Saga, Meatloaf, Oonagh. And so forth.

                    Rap does indeed suck…though I think WNs might appreciate early Public Enemy. Their stage shows were a celebration of pseudo-fascist, unpozzed black nationalism.

                    I was just thinking…just like South Africa and Rhodesia have regressed back to black norms once free from white rule, that black music is now regressing back to a more primitive style. Rap music, with its emphasis on beat over melody and lyrics about ho’s and crime, is a long ways from Motown and jazz and big band music from the days when America was 87 percent white.

            No.  There are around 1.4 billion people in China. They are about 92% Han Chinese. The other 8% are made up of 56 ethnic groups with a more varied genetic background, but the other 8% are physically indistinguishable from the Han Chinese. If you go to China, all you will see are Chinese people because there is next to zero observable racial diversity in China.China has a continuous written history going back 4,000 years.  Some analysts believe China has a 100 year plan to become the most powerful nation on earth. China is living proof that racial diversity is not necessary for anything in society.Same with Japan. Japan is about 98% Japanese. By the end of WW II Japan was a bombed, burned out radioactive waste land. Today there are a million people living in Hiroshima. In the last 75 years, Japan has re-built an entire nation and now has the 3rd largest GDP in the world.Again, racial diversity is not necessary for anything in society.

                    It really should be on everyone’s “watch” list.  There are quite a few demonstrations (probably unintentional) of what happens when you try to get useful work out of 70 IQ folk with their attendant behavioral characteristics.  One example is a scene where the Chinese construction engineer laments the state of the new construction trucks recently brought over from China.  They were basically junk after a couple of years due to improper maintenance and neglect.  I believe that’s where the title of the movie may have came from.  That is to say, a recognition that all the efforts of the Chinese will come to nought once they leave and turn over the road maintenance to the native population—a common occurrence throughout Africa after colonialism.

                        The Chinese guys frustration dealing with them throughout the movie was palatable. And it was really interesting when he was talking, with great admiration at the Ingenuity and Industry, about how the Dutch laid down  miles and miles of railroad and then looking at this black guy saying and you guys  couldn’t even maintain it you just destroyed it all.

            That “doomsday machine” is basically a nuclear weapon and nuclear reactor  simulator. The US has one, too, called the Z Pulsed Power Facility, or “Z Machine”. Can be assumed the Russians also have/had one. Zero Hedge, in their usual slothfully derpy way, actually described a military dirty bomb used for area denial. China gets one, boomercons are all farting about a renewed arms race; yet where were all of you at for the preceding 40 years when the US was openly running a Z Machine? But more importantly, yeah, women need to be denied 90% of the positions in the military, and any command, command/control, command/policy position should be denied by default.

        Sorry about being pedantic, but an axiom is not a statement that is self-evidently true. An axiom is a statement taken (by some relevant population—geometers or set theoreticians, for example) as true without proof. Some statements must be taken as true without proof in order to have proofs of other statements. Vary the axioms and you vary the body of true statements. Geometry is the paradigm case. And, the midwit judge to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing can be somewhat axiomatic. A statement is either taken as axiomatic (by some relevant population) or it isn’t. What she meant was something like, “‘Diversity is an important aspect of education’ is taken as axiomatic by Leftist ideologues such as I”.

            This reminds me of Sandra Day O’Connor’s statement after reaffirming the legality of affirmative action in the U. of Michigan case: “Perhaps in another 30 or 40 years affirmative action will no longer be needed.” Naturally, there was no mention of any objective, observable, measurable goal that needed to be achieved so that we whites would know WHEN we have reached that exalted state of existence wherein we have finally shaken off the coils of our “racism”. As it is, whites can be discriminated against ad infinitum unless we finally decide to revolt.

Yannow how, in the bad old days before blacks had civil rights? When roving gangs of nigger-hating white supremists roamed the streets, lynching poor, innocent black people at random for no reason at all?
What if (and I’m just spit ballin’ here) the black people that got lynched … actually deserved it?
Dindus?!?!? In the Before Times? Good heavens, what have I been smoking? Perish the thought!!! Sorry to waste your time everyone! My tinfoil hat fits a little tight some days and makes me hatey…

            I must warn you that if you pursue this line of thinking you may end up sympathizing with the Klan (first incarnation).  Not necessarily everything they did, but the basic idea of imposing vigilante justice where the law was insufficient.  You wouldn’t want to do to that.

        “It is axiomatic that (racial) diversity is an important aspect of education.”Well, then it is also axiomatic that Jewish schools are racist, are antithetical to proper education, are performing a grave disservice to Jewish students by failing to educate them in a properly diverse setting, and must therefore be outlawed.All Jewish schools, both private and religious, must be fully integrated at once, with generous, generous, generous supplies of negroes, Latinos, Muslims and Hindus.  The fact that there are still “Jewish” schools in Current Year is a toxic affront to Diversity.  I can’t even.  Our highest goal must be to rescue these oppressed Jewish students from the nightmare of homogeneity.  Jewish education must become /real/ education, which is to, Diverse education — at the point of a gun, if need be.It will be objected that Jewish schools are private entities.  So is Harvard.It will be objected that Jewish schools are Jewish-owned, for the benefit of Jews.So is Harvard.

        “Therefore, we can now put the upper bound on diversity as 20% of the population being black. Any more than that and white crime victimization begins to soar and awareness of it begins to soar. ”
It is amazing to me how consistent this phenomena is across our country and, I suspect, across other countries within the anglosphere.   The degree of denial of this obvious trend is shocking.

            Living and working in Memphis a couple of decades ago I often thought to myself that if they could convince half of the black population to move, this place would boom. Alas, this has not happened.

                I think New Orleans had a brief resurgence of hope once a major portion of its black population was removed to Houston in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. They must have moved back.

Hey I’m a fair man, I vote we keep the diversity level at 10% just to keep it spicy and remind us of the others. How do I get rid of the 40% of white cucks and looney progs?Just need a good plan to implement, perhaps from nature.

                This is something diversity doesn’t understand.  The subject of being white just never comes up. It’s just not that important to white people. Blacks and Jews  talk endlessly about their ethnicity. It is a central organizing feature of their lives.I remember vising my best friend’s mother one time after she and her husband moved out to the country.  I sit down at the table and ask how she’s doing and her answer “I hate it! There’s not another Jew for 50 miles!” Same with blacks.  I think the average white person is clueless about how important being black or Jewish is to the average black or Jew, while they are clueless as to how important being white is to the average white, which is not at all.Everyone is just projecting.

                    The (self-) defining characteristic is not ethnicityper se, but rather victimhoodsolelybecause of their ethnicity.
One could understand that in a largely low-IQ group, but it is difficult to rationalize in a high-IQ group. The lack of introspection and self-reflection is amazing, but may be a defense mechanism.
As to your remark about “The subject of being white just never comes up” — well, it is now. The “coalition of the fringes,” the eternal victims, and the racebaiters have done more than any klansman, or Nazi (name your evil white bugaboo) have to forge a generic White identity.

            Well they tend to self-identify so it’s not hard to expel them at gun point or simply give them a box car ride to oblivion. Generally you find them concentrated among white professionals since they have the money to isolate themselves from the shit they promote.Also IMO they are far more destructive to white society than blacks. Because it’s they who promote insane and suicidal social policies that promote brown skins and sexual deviants into a protected class, gut law enforcement, water down the laws so criminals do little or no time., Make self-defense by law abiding citizens illegal and disarm them as well.In a sense they create the environment that the black and Mexican criminal can thrive in.

            “I vote we keep the diversity level at 10 per cent”
Never works that way in the long run.
In a free society that is 90/10 White/black (and notice I said a FREE society), in just two generations it is 70/15/15 White/black/mulatto, in four generations it is 40/30/30 White/black/mulatto, and so on.  Diversity plus freedom equals mudslide.
“Where de White wimminz at?” is a universal aspect of all non-East Asian societies.

            Hah! I was in SF and SJ last week (after a 5-year hiatus) and was struck by how negro-free San Francisco and Cupertino/Palo Alto/Mtn View were compared to many/most major metropolitan areas in the US. That said, the both Peninsula and South Bay are heavily Asian (East &gt; SE and South Asian). The little bit of East Bay that I strayed into was delightfully vibrant.“remember this is the world our elite lives in”Key point. The vibrancy that does make its way into the world of the self-proclaimed “elite” is mostly vetted and generally represents the cognitive (or at least the most verbally facile) elite of the vibrancy. So it’s not entirely hypocrisy when the lifelong denizen and product of rich hometown and elite schools says that she doesn’t see any systematic difference. (But I maintain that if you get such an actually privileged Goodwhite a little drunk then you often will hear their true thoughts on group differences.)

        Slogged for work pre-travel, but will pop in to nod agreement – 10 to 15 percent is where I’ve always put the diversity tolerance threshold.  As much as it wrenches at CivNat sensibilities, we’re going to need to start negotiating these kind of bargains in the near future as we verge on minority status.  What are our Singapore-style diversity quotas for each race?  We can’t afford to be “just leave me alones” on the race issue when everyone else is pushing for our race to leave the table.  We have to advocate a postive White right to exist with the same stridency we hear it from Zionists re: Israel, or get shouted out of the room.Z’s mentioned “the number” here before – the argument vs. emo open borders refugee nannies to “tell us how many is enough,” and a variant for reparations saying “how much is the ‘full and final’ settlement for slavery – we’ll cut that check.”  Making the other guys throw out numbers is how the multicultural sausage gets made.  They want us to remain reluctant to advocate for ourselves out of some sort of pathological politeness.  It’s time for hatespeakers to set the tone on this and start forcing these “national conversations” to be something other than ritualistic caucasian flagellation.“Hispanics” are an artificial constituency with factions that could be useful to us.  I’ve talked about “Azteps” before.  We’ve all noted how regional and national differences make “Hispanic solidarity” impossible, and their caste system already sorts for White European leadership.  I’d help Castizo authoritarians apartheid the Mayans &amp; kill drug dealers. Post for another day.

            If white men, as a group, showed some balls, men of other persuasions would be lining up to sign on as honorary white men.  Who wants to ally with self-haters or snowflakes?
It also looks to me like the role models for young black men are now either the gangbanger of some sort, even if mostly roleplaying, or the flamboyantly gay.  Helluva choice there, Duwayne.

            Yeah, to have a homogeneous society on the street level, I think 10% vibrancy is the absolute top. But the real kicker is differentiated birth rates. Different birth rates and 2% is suddenly 15% and beyond that you can’t control it by ‘civilized’ means…..
All young men should do military or similar service. And women’s equivalent……is to bear children. A woman does her national service w the womb, that is the most ‘patriotic’ female organ. ‘Unsavory’ as that may be to some sensibilities to state that bluntly.

                As for a patriotic womb, possibly tax incentives that motivate. Disincentive the welfare queen. Change the culture to uplift the role of mothers and kids. That’s a very important big one. That requires positive propaganda.Don’t tell women they can’t seek skills outside of the home until their kid is 25….won’t work.  I was there the first 5 years…incentive to raise young kids and not guvmint daycare raising and indoctrinating the kid.  Then I went to work in a low-pressure job as a Girl Friday secretary for a private school. Got to pick up my kid from school and bring her to work for an hour. Then home for gadding about, taking walks and homework. Stayed in low pressured easy to come and go legal secretary one man outfit jobs until daughter was out of the house, then exploded into EBMUD water company career building with a dogged determination.If you keep us tethered like Islam, I personally will lead the revolution even if the unintended consequences are dreadful. We should avoid a swing to extremes, even though right now many men, including my husband, are pissed at women and don’t want them wielding voting power by emotion. What happens to those of us who are thinkers? Basic Husband chose me because I think….and a few other choice reasons. I don’t want to be roped in to the herd of feminist harridan women. Got a conundrum here.  I keep going back to the wisdom of Aristophanes.

Repeal CRA, no title Vii/ix. No MfJ tax rates for females over 40 with no progeny, MfJ rates 1/2 of single rates, abolish “head of household”.

                        The problem that all of you “cut off the welfare!” guys face is that very few people are willing to watch irresponsible people and their children die in the street, even if the parents deserve it.
Personally, I could watch the adults cut off from welfare die in the street.  I’m just telling you that the vast majority of white people would pay any tax to avoid this.
You are not going to cut off welfare to anyone until times get very harsh.

                            There are also real risks involved in it. Do you really want Crips, Bloods, MS13 and the like taking over welfare and paying for it with drug money made of your people’s backs?There are also plenty of politically and power minded people out there who would be happy to mobilize them for whatever they want which is probably your rugged individualists head on a pike.The anti welfare people kind of have an  assumption that this is a moral society or at least that they are entitled to moral treatment.This is risible on  its face. The US isn’t any more moral than any other nation in the Americas. There is little fee social capital left so no more moral  freeloading.Peace must be paid forNow attaching strings to it and having reciprocal expectations is fine , good even but no matter what, so long as the US remains complex (that is we have water, electricity or higher) you will have to pay for welfare and regulate commerce to ensure people have work

                    Rangefront, I’m afraid I have to disagree with you here.  Strenuously.  You and I are exceptions.  The rules cannot and should not be made with us in mind.  And any rules, which absolutely must be made and enforced until the first few generations have grown up in a White society with positive social pressure, can and should then be relaxed because the societal rules will be self reinforcing, particularly if said society maintains its homogeneity and strict cultural separation – i.e. not even importing movies made elsewhere that feature diversity.

        California universities are overwhelmingly Asian these days.  In a perfectly free environment of admissions, where only the highest scoring survive, nearly all blacks and latinos would be eliminated from higher education, at least at the prestigious level.  The slick talking Obamas of the world, claiming to be from Kenya, after dealing coke at a previous school in which no one there remembers them, would never have made it.  Neither would the ex-coke addict and alcoholic dim-wit son of a CIA Director who spent his 20’s in a Mexican brothel far from Vietnam.   What this decision is saying is that the current elite knows it’s a fraudulent elite and needs the fig leaf of diversity to hide behind that leaf.  The real elite hides in the shadows during eras of late stage democracy.

        I remember hearing about the phenomenon a few years back, I can’t remember from whom, and the term used was “Peak Negro” – the maximum percentage of blacks in a group before non-blacks begin abandoning the group.  It applies not just to cities and schools, but also parties, restaurants, churches, etc.  If I recall correctly I think the number they came up with was 20% also.
I suspect the latinx PN% is lower than whites, and asian PN% is lower still, which is probably why blacks prefer to seek out white communities to enrich.

        Sorry, ZMan, but, while I agree wholeheartedly with your premise (even if I do not AT ALL know the reason for those numbers being true), I take issue with one of your later assertions. You wrote that Hispanics are “a group that is a social construct” and by that prove that you do not live in a community dominated by Hispanics (predominantly of Mexican descent). Living (and at least partially growing up) in a community where “Hispanics” (Mexicans) predominate in roughly the same percentage as “whites” do nationally (65%) I can tell you that the group termed “Hispanics” is no mere “construct”. They are very much a real group with their own culture, language (Tex-Mex) and even holidays. They are the ones celebrating “Cinco de Mayo” and “Diez y seis de Septiembre”. And back in ’68 when we here in Alamo Town had a race riot BROWN was the predominant color since 15% rioting against 20% doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.

            I read that as more nuanced.  “Hispanic” is as real as “European-Americans.” There are Cubans, Mexicans, Brazilians, and other ethnicities, but no “Hispanics.” There are Yankee Puritans, Texans, scandicuck midwesterns, californicators, Southrons, etc., but no “European-Americans.” Whoever peddles those terms is lying to you about something.

            “Hispanic” is a fake racial category that emerged from our government’s desire to keep track of people in the USA who speak Spanish. It also serves the racial spoils system.  As others have noted, there are white people who are “Hispanic” like Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz who nobody would confuse for a “Hispanic” in a room full of white people despite their surnames.I’ve long said that the main definition of “Hispanic” is Liberal-Democrat voters who speak Spanish and who have a high affinity for government services.  Anybody else who speaks Spanish and has a Latino surname isn’t “Hispanic”…again it’s largely a stand-in for “Spanish-speaking Democrat voters”.  I have friends born-and-raised in the USA with Latino surnames who consider themselves “Hispanic” in the same sense that I consider myself “Italian”…I have the name and I know a little bit of the family history…and I like pizza.

                Yep, Hispanic is a fuzzy term, but it does work in a broad sense for discussion.  Obviously where I live the term covers predominantly Mexican descent.  Until recently however, our Hispanic population was pretty Americanized and we lived rather seamlessly together.  Lots of established families with large profiles and long standing roots in the community.  The great influx of immigrants—legal and illegal, coupled with ethnic grifters organizing these folk have screwed the pooch.

                Its racial mostly though not entirely. Hispanics are mestizo or indio not peninsular or criollo  descendedThe cultural variable, some  M/I are Right and some P and C are Left but by in large it works out just like the casta system of MexicoHowever no one other than a few Libertarian/Minarchist and Militia Right is interested in a tiny stateIts’ simply not feasible in world with computers, home genetic engineering, ultra dangerous drugs increasingly powerful drones and  robots and other nightmare tech there will be state and lots of it.Hell in order for there to even be jobs especially decently paid ones for the under 120 IQ  crowd much less men in general there will also have to be stateSince its not going anywhere I want me and my people’s  spoils too

        England, Sweden, and Germany seem to be leading edge indicators of the experiment in unconstrained diversity. We can learn a lot about what to expect in our future based upon the changes that occur in those countries. My guess is that we will see a “diversity” of outcomes. Some may degrade into social chaos, or civil war, or perhaps descend into Third World status. Or perhaps the entire European Continent will enter a new Dark Age (literally). Here’s an axiom for you . . . the negatives aren’t going to be cured with obtuse legal rulings or political rhetoric.

            England is still over 80% white.  Germany is whiter still (even the Turks are just slightly over 3% of the population.)   Sweden is another story with ~19% being foreign born, but many of those are from the EU, Norway, or the USA.  Migrant ghettos are a problem in any society due to their unwillingness to assimilate, but it’s the US, Canada, and Australia that are struggling.

                No doubt Europe is in far better shape than the U.S. That said, they seem to be trying to make up for lost time. Ten percent of births in England are to Muslims. Probably close to 25% of birth in England are non-white. In France, ~20% of births are to Muslims with another 5-10% to other non-whites. Births in Germany are probably 10-15% non-whites.
Granted, compared to the U.S., that’s great, but it’s still troubling. In addition, Europe’s non-whites are becoming increasingly Muslim and Africa – or both. Mexicans are one thing, Muslims and blacks are another.

                Beyond that, Hollywood and the U.S. media have prioritized the diverse culture for decades now.  Jim Lileks’ blog posts all sorts of old American cultural stuff.  He does a weekly excerpt of a few pages from the 1980’s Sears catalogue.  Unspoken is how white it all is.  Token vibrancy amongst the clothes models, but it is all white middle class in its orientation and aspirations, 100%.  That’s all gone now.  Now the clothes has vulgar and provocative words plastered on the women’s butts and bodices.  That’s so ghetto.  Obama was a wake up call for a lot of people about where it all goes, if we stay on that path.  He provided a service, of sorts.

                    Poor James Lileks. A clever, stylish writer but his nostalgia for the old white America is painful to read. The guy’s flag is planted in Minneapolis, the center of the Somali catchment area. I don’t know if he’s still published by theStribbut I recall years ago when the paper demoted him from columnist to reporter, probably because he was too white and conservative.

        A nice quantitative item was let slip about a year ago, by one of the staff at the  Harvard College admissions office:  he stated that without the blessings of affirmative action, the Harvard freshman class would have had exactly one black member, rather than the thirty-one who were actually admitted.So the next time you encounter a well-spoken, well-groomed black guy with an Ivy League degree and a sharp crease in his trousers, know (with roughly 97% confidence) that his intellectual horsepower is at the same level of a graduate of a decent state university.The above, sadly, is why I would not utilize the services of a black physician, attorney (continue the job roster ad infinitum) unless I had absolutely no alternative.

May and Merkle weren’t good.You need to keep the whites on to keep the lights on.But you need to Man up to keep the Tech up.Technically Asians can maintain what they copy, but their shame conformity culture tends to prevent either innovation or exploiting discoveries.White Patriarchy was a benevolent dictatorship of the masses.  Women weren’t kept on their pedestals, but instead of catering to them, when they originally wanted equality, they got it good and hard (Wyoming was the first to give THEIR women suffrage, but there the women had to deal with beasts, barbarians, and blizzards trying to kill them and men couldn’t waste time with them complaining).We had a representative republic, and not universal suffrage.

        1965, or take 1963, as I think it was the turning point really.  If you were not fortunate enough to live in the U.S.A at that time, I can only tell you that is was spectacular.  Even for a lower middle class kid, living in what are called row houses, it was a wonderfully sweet time.It’s true that you did have to regularly duck beneath your school room desk as a drill for the coming nuclear bomb, courtesy of our former allies fighting those Nazis.  But the probability of that bomb was pretty low.  Unlike the probability of that same kid, in 2019, being stomped by gang of teen POC angry about the killing of Emmit Till, or whatever they are worked up about.I didn’t live there, but I can imagine how indescribably beautiful life in 1963 California must have been, as it was wonderful in places that weren’t paradise.

        There actually is a fairly accurate maximum tax at the US federal level.It’s just under 20% of GDPThis is colloquially called Hauser’s Law and is for the most part accurate within 1% for most of the 20th and 21st century.This upper bound is why we end up borrowing so much, between corruption and priorities is nigh impossible to make ends meet for any length of time.Worse as efficiency both from automation and trade lowers the value of labor, both the need for services (assuming you accept this as legitimate) and function of the economy degrades. Less wages means a smaller private sector. This effect is why the US economy is 40% or so government alreadyHell even the Wall Street Journal just realized the obvious, supposedly middle class people can’t afford new carsThis will ensure a poorer nation in the long run and throw in some unwanted diversity and you have the recipe for a spoils state or possibly an ethnic war . Best case Brazil, worst case Yemen.The amount of State that can be tolerated does very in case anyone is wondering. Its higher in Europe , higher still in Scandinavia though there is an upper bound and places like Norway have a robust private sector.As for the amount of diversity, our host is of course correct. Maximum diversity is at 1965 level but it will require ethnic cleansing to get thatThere is also a caveat, the biggest cause of our dysfunction is broken families. Every broken family increases the social cost of everything. This is worse with Black families who can go from working folk to feral at the drop of  hat but it’s no great delight for any other group. Whites from broken homes are crappy too.This means eliminating the diversity of single mommies and baby daddies.The only people having children should be people who are married and in it for the long term,The means the nü state whatever that is will have to have a strong moral basis and enforce that at gunpoint. If  children, one man, one woman, one marriage for life baring criminal abuse , adultery (which will become a crime) neglect or desertionWorse for the Libertarians it also means hefty economic regulation too. People need long term employment in order for family formation and so that people will opt into the moral systemA lot of religious types and “rights/natural law” types don’t understand is that social stability must be paid for and if I’m an outcast or battended about by the winds of economic disruption, you have no expectation that I conform to your social normsYou have to either force or earn my  cooperation, you are not entitled to itLastly as much as it pains me to say it, the Democrats are right about political diversity being something we need less of . I obviously favor a different tact than they do but a huge range of opinions on marriage, rights of workers, value of human life, the ecology, firearms and faith cannot coexist in a single nation with modern technology.A fix either means forcing compliance with a single directive or separation. Trying to bodge  together the US  by making it Whiter just won’t workWe need One VisionOB Queenhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKRhhu1KZdY

            Totally agree.  It’s about 17%.  You can’t really extract more than 17% without all kinds of problems.  Government has grown far beyond that.  I see more of a Yugoslavia coming up than anything.  With placid regions like Slovenia just getting a scrape or two while other regions would be more like Sarajevo.  Total ethnic conflict with trees being cut down for firewood.  It’s a big country with big problems and the problems won’t be distributed evenly.Also, the welfare state is now multi-generational.  You have people that were born who had no business being born outside of a wealth transfer superstructure, and have monkey like instincts that just won’t make it when that superstructure falls apart.  This includes all races, some much more than others.  It will be more of a cleansing of bad DNA than an ethnic cleansing.

                It’s not as easy as you think. High tech society has increasingly little use for labor and as computers evolve, more and more people will fall into this trapAutomation, free trade, computers and so on create an unparalleled efficiency trap which will in the long term lead to disasterMost people (Whites here) have an IQ of around 100 which renders them increasingly less useful compared to machines . This is reaching increasingly larger percentages of the population and a society where 10% of the population have a place and everyone else isn’t even useful as  peasant is not one that is eugenicFundamentally this leads to what in effect  is mass sterility and an end to modernityIf the dissident right takes power finding a way out of that trap is going to be a major important challenge one that can’t be solved by moralism.Urban living costs money and machines lower wages faster than they lower the cost of goodsNot easy to square that circle.

        Now we all know that “diversity” really means “down with whites” but if we play naive and use the word in its original meaning, it’s interesting to note that the population of NFL players (at approximately 68% black [1]) is less diverse than the general population of the US (at slightly under 64% white).Where are the cries of anguish and demands for Hiroshi at halfback, Lin-Wei the linebacker [2], or Shlomo the safety, for that matter?[1] the 68% is approximate because of the “mystery meat” issue[2] do you find the idea of Chinese (average size of male in PRC = 5’6″, 146#) as linebackers risible?. Of course you do, you deplorable racists. Even Good People think it somewhat ridiculous. But that’s what you have to do if you truly believe in Affirmative Action.

        As I’ve mentioned before, this is the result when women’s “care based morality” replaces men’s justice based morality, when equality under the law is replaced by “equality of outcome”.Equality IS the highest virtue of communism, followed only by envy; it’s the primary reason that women and minorities like blacks and mexicans are so immaturely attracted to it and it’s vacuous blandishments.“I think that the world should be run on universal fairness and equality because…because…MY VAGINA!!!!”If you STILL doubt this please look at the Oct 1st installment of Chris Muir’s comic blog, “Day by Day”; the character of Zack calls it for what it is and singlehandedly and eloquently describes why more and more men are wisely choosing to go their own way (MGTOW).The ONLY peaceful solution to politically empowered gynocentrism that has been allowed to run amok along with it’s tethered parasitic welfare state is what Turd Flinging Monkey has called for, which is to immediately take women’s unearned voting rights away, immediately stop empowering them and end ALL welfare both domestically and internationally.Voting, especially voting by women  (the largest voting demographic) IS what brought America to the current shitty state of affairs. More of the same voting won’t solve the problem!So, are you ready to take women’s unearned voting rights away, end their empowerment  (which WILL, result in more babies, especially white babies being born) and end ALL welfare?….Islam IS right about women btw; do you want Islam to take their rights (all) away or do you want to just take their vote away and save them and Western Civilization in the process?Times running out….Tick…tock…tick…tock…NorthGunner – The Truth Is It’s OWN Defense!

        “Somewhat axiomatic” meaning: “The model of the world used by the Goodwhites has as one of its axioms that diversity of all sorts, including racial diversity, is an important aspect of education. The axioms used by Badwhites are irrelevant because we control the institutions.”

                With respect to Zman’s regular output, this column breaks new ground (IMO) in trying to quantify an “optimal” amount of diversity. The question itself is never asked, perhaps because it seems to lend itself only to the realm of opinion. But even if that’s ultimately the case, Z has shown how the relevant axis of opinion could be considerably narrowed. Nice work.

        Sigh. Who gives a rat’s ass about sports and music?  The worst thing about the American Lenin getting whacked by JWB is his plan to get rid of them after the War of Northern Aggression never came to fruition. Yes, I am a racist. Now let me tell all of you clueless sports and tuneless jive music zombies about “Bump Day”.Back in the late 40’s and early 50’s, Los Angeles had a marvelous public transportation system called the Pacific Electric Railway.  A lot of people used it, including most of my family members. It could get you from the extreme Northwest of LA city limits clear down to the beaches. On a certain day of the week, the Black people would deliberately nudge, jostle, and bump up against the whites. It was given. I remember all of the adults at the family gatherings talking about it.You people extol the virtues of a Kobe Bryant or Jerry Rice. But, the reality is little Jamal and his hyena homies jacking up your son/grandson in the school restroom for his lunch money. Blacks are violent physical people. They have been brought up on the notion if you see Whitey and he/she has something you want, you take it. I had one tell me than when I was in college(1965-1969). I saw it as a MP in the Army and as a Peace Officer in SoCal for over 30 years.Yes, as individuals, you will always meet some who are articulate, educated, and live their lives conforming to the Ten Commandments.  But anyone who has had dealings with them as a group; whether they are cops, firefighters(Dad was in Watts#1) small/large retail establishments, ER nurses, UPS drivers, etc. will have their own horror stories about the Wankandans and their Vato-Loco, Cholo/Chola fellow travelers. This is why I am writing this from Winterfell(North Idaho).  I want to protect myself and my family from them. Forever.

        I think private universities should basically admit whomever they want. I think the more problematic thing about this Harvard issue is how central Harvard/Yale are to later admission to the top elite. Last I looked every single SCOTUS justice came from just those two universities’ law schools. It’s Harvard’s extreme prestige that is the elephant in the room here.About diversity, white minimum of 50% and black maximum of 20% sound intuitively right, the former maybe a little low and the latter a little high but otherwise reasonable.As a sidenote, I think ‘axiom’ means something assumed to be true as the basis of further analysis rather than something that must be true. But at some level an axiom must have genuine truth context which makes it different from an assumption. In any case that is OT here.

            I believe their admissions criteria goes something like this:  Big Donors/Legacies; Tenured Faculty Connections/Nepotism;  Vibrants;  Jocks.   Fun fact to know and tell:  Harvard’s Extension School has had to slow down day classes because the admitted kids were falling behind the Extension School kids.  In the Sciences, anyway.   It makes sense if you think about it.

            Moran – sorry, but your casual throwaway line of “I think private universities should basically admit whomever they want” is standard boomercon Conservative, Inc. crap.  The same way they claim a purportedly “private” company can hire/fire whoever it wants (as they justify the purging of wrongthinkers because muh sacred principles).  There is no longer any such thing as a private university or company with the US  laws on anti-discrimination, etc.  The borg’s nose is poked in everywhere.  As for diversity, I’ll pass on all of it.  I loved traveling back in the day, but when I finally came home I found home was gone – and now even traveling it’s all becoming the same.  Separate countries for separate people.  Period.  Visits can and should be possible, but permanent resettlement extremely rare.

            “Most likely, the right mix for maximum diversity benefits is something close to what America was like in 1965.”Personally, I don’t see the need for any sarcasm. I was alive at that time, and America was much better then by almost any measure, although I would question whether this was because of optimal diversity. Rather, it was the last year of sanity for America’s governing classes.In all seriousness, it’s remarkable how often that year keeps coming up. Peter Turchin says that almost all American social indicators started going downhill, starting in 1965, with some holding out until 1980. We can argue about when America’s peak year was, but there’s no doubt that we entered a steepening decline sometime in that period.

                My “sarcasm” was directed at the fact that just a few weeks ago, he wrote that nostalgia wasn’t the answer, or at the least misguided.  Now he seems to imply it’s okay if the mix reverted back to 1965.  I don’t argue with this article overall.

                    OK, I see what you mean. No, nostalgia is not the answer, but a car still needs a rearview mirror.  A glance back never hurts. But obviously there’s no going back.

                And 1965 was just around the time that Vatican Council II was getting heated up. And look at what that brought on.A Catholic perspective on our slide into oblivion:In 1965: I personally think that it was the start of it all: Mass devolving into the lowest common denominator, and releasing thev evil into the world. Before that, it was held fairly well in-check by conservative morals and Latin Mass.

                Well, I as a young teen I noticed that, even though my parents didn’t care for President Kennedy, his assasination in November 1963 shocked and confused them, and public confidence regarding the future took a sharp major turn downward, never to recover its previous level in my lifetime. Shortly afterward, Amercian involvement in an undeclared SE Asian war having nothing to do with legitimate self-defense was ramping up, causing the country to split vehemently along political lines. In 1968 Robert Kennedy and MLK were assasinated, anti-war protests broke out, and race riots more violent and destructive than we’ve yet seen in this decade were occuring in my midwestern hometown and other major cities nationwide.

        Z-Man, I have a (somewhat OT) question. You wrote that “the judge has organized her life to be around as little diversity as possible, with a special emphasis on avoiding vibrancy”. What does “vibrancy” mean in the sense that you and others here are using it? I looked it up online and am still stumped as to what you are saying. I just decided that you were using “vibrancy” as the opposite to “diversity”. But then others used the word and I came to doubt my conclusion.Now let me say up front that one of the reasons I read your blog is because you challenge my vocabulary. Whenever I encounter a word which is either completely unknown to me or which in context makes no sense according to my understanding of the word. One of the beautiful things about the internet is being to mark, copy and paste any word I do not understanding into a search engine. It is a hellova lot easier and faster than stopping reading a book an cracking open my personal copy of “Webster’s”. The problem here is that the online “Webster’s” hasincreasedmy confusion rather than abating it.(Note: I have never been accused of beingvocabularily challenged. In point of fact in the 7th grade (’63) I tested as having the vocabulary of a college sophomore back when college sophomores actuallyHADvocabularies.)

            Diversity has diverse constituents, all the colors of the rainbow and all beliefs.  Vibrancy is when someone of diversity interacts with the non-diverse so as to culturally enrich the non-diverse; such as, kinetically propelling an insufficiently diverse autonomous economic unit in front of a subway car, or transforming a non-diverse youth into a differently-abled person by helping them off a 3rd floor balcony in a mall, or simply redistributing a non-vibrant’s wallet to the vibrant.

            Vibrancy is a term of derision directed at people who don’t get that vibrancy is a mockery of diversity and everything the woke culture stands for.
Vibrancy is a television commercial for high speed internet with a family consisting of a black father, a white or asian mother, and three kids who appear to be Paki, Chinese, and a little red head girl with freckles.
If the company selling the internet is operating at Extreme Woke, the parents are two gay men of different races playing snuggle bunny with children on the couch eating homemade cookies.

            “Vibrant” as slang for people of color, or areas where they predominate, comes from its popularity as a euphemism in politically correct journalism. You can’t say that an area inhabited by blacks is a slum, so to be on the safe side you use “vibrant” to make it sound exotic.This ploy is especially popular in travel and tourism promotion. The hacks who write such stuff aren’t very bright, but they do understand that if they tried to get tourists to visit some “attraction” described as being in a black or Mexican neighborhood, almost everyone (including some persons of color) would swerve. So it’s dubbed “vibrant” like, you know, cool.
