        Flight (white and others) is the only real rational response.  So Obama’s goal was to Section 8 our asses.  Always remember what the hard left wants to do to us.

            Dutch, why do you believe that flight is the only real rational response? Does that discourage aggressors better than standing your ground? Does flight help one to rationalize the expense of acquiring and filling a “bug out bag”?

                Because life is short and living among low-impulse-control individuals and low IQ people is not attractive to me.  Call me a bigot if you would like.  Remus at Woodpile Report advises to “stay away from crowds”.  My twist on it, learned from the hell that is called junior high, is to surround myself with people I am comfortable with, and to avoid like the plague people I am not comfortable with.  I will do what I need to do to protect my family and myself, and the first step in that process is choosing my neighborhood very carefully.  Obama’s version of Section 8 was to identify that process of carefully choosing one’s neighborhood, which many people do, and upend it.  It was done with malice, IMO.  See “blockbusting” for an older version of the same thing.

                    Our backs are against a wall here.  There is nowhere left to run to unless you want to move to the high plains or mountain West.  Once people Obama and every other blockbuster before him figure out they can push you around, they keep doing it.
A non-trinitarian, unconventional strategy is what’s needed.  Many immigrant groups that come here do not call the police when dealing with black crime.  POlice forces are a modern invention of the last 200 years.  Before that, people handled problems themselves.

            The rational response is Fight not Flight but for now its best to be irrational since every day not at war is a day you can prepare for war. Prepare and make many nasty friends, you’ll need them.We can’t agree in anything enough to start anything and shouldn’t anyway however we will have to defend ourselves since outright extermination or subjugation of the   European descended peoples especially the Deplorables is the goal of the Left since the equality they worship can’t be had while the Others remainI am fairly sure that as soon as Trump and people like him are gone, there will be political  reprisals on a massive scale, a few small ones at first than growing.The choice you have is Fight or be enslaved or dead , no   other. As some white nationalists are fond of saying “Diversity is hunting down the last White person” and you will never be left alone even if you aren’t actually  whiteAssimilation won’t happen, coexistence won’t happen period, obey are die is the Lefts creed.And note this isn’t going to be The Revolution 2.0 or even something as nice as the Civil War 2.0 but more Rwanda X Bosnia meets Carthage or outright extermination  if the  Left can pull it offAnd note the Right isn’t sane any more either, the Furor Teutonicus, the Saxon hate is out there and when its unleashed . God, Gods help us all.Right now there is a small window in which this madness  can be avoided, separation , repatriation a sufficient lock in power till saner people come on line whatever.Hell even talking here among ourselves and in the open helps a little.We can stop this awfulness  and I even see signs among the Liberals that they want to stop it too but its not a given.

        There will always be low impulse control, low IQ people who will congregate in ghettos. Ancient Rome had a large one and pretty much every city in the world today has one. There is nothing to be “done” about this as there will always be large numbers of low impulse control, low IQ people. The best that can be done is to keep them penned in which is what’s being done de facto all over the world. Utopia does not exist, and if it did we’d all be dead from boredom or we’d manufacture conflict to keep us stimulated and alive. We only know we’re alive because we know we’re going to die. Good/bad, rich/poor, up/down, smart/dumb, without contrast we do not exist.

            But, because of their lower levels of wealth, the Romans used more ‘active measures’ than our current, largely catch-and-release, system.   As did the English in Dickens day as well as all other societies up to the last 100 years ago or so.  We can afford the current system, for now.It seems that we will always have with us those deficient in impulse control or IQ.  So it is darkly amusing that should the Progs actually succeed in their objective of turning us into Venezuela, their elaborate methods of dealing with such folks will be long gone along with the deficit funding propping it up.  It is even more ironic since it is obvious by now that most of their precious processes are just make-work for mid-witted Cloud spawn: An elaborate charade, perhaps.

                I’m pretty sure they know it’s a charade, a pretense for making money and moral preening. All from behind the gates of very safe enclaves of wealth and status.

                Those “active measures” included a culling, by imprisonment/exile/death, of the least able to control their low-impulse/high violence tendencies.  Over centuries of time, this altered the genetic basis of the White European population.  The natural African environment has, to the contrary, rewarded its most violent and profligate inhabitants.  Epigenetics combined with highly predictive heritable DNA equals racial reality.

The best that was ever done with the impulsive and violent was to hang them by the neck until dead. Rehabilitation is for non-violent criminals.

        It seems to me a big problem with well behaved blacks is they love signaling against whites by voting  democrat or calling those whites who speak out against being robbed and murdered by blacks racist or worse.

        Most (white) people assume that their ancestors from the early middle ages were quite like themselves but only lacking literacy, running water, and opportunity, when in fact they were nothing like us. The behaviors of people at an inborn level changed tremendously over ten centuries of frequent public executions, and more so through feudal and manorial population demographic changes which were more suitable for the times. The people who could manage in the 17th century were by and large not those who could get by in the 6th. The great problem with Africans is that they have simply not undergone that type of culling. Those who desire to jump over the centuries have the opportunity to do so, but when they accomplish this they see fifty percent of their children fall right back. One black Baltimore cop offered that we should build a high wall around that ghetto with a gate to let out certifiable humans only, and then just flood it. That solution would have appeared to be entirely proper and necessary in the 16th century.

            I get your last point, loud and clear.  It strikes me that the Germans used a similar process in WW2 Warsaw, and the Cloud People seem to be practicing a (so far) “soft” version of it on the Dirt People today.  All using their own definitions of “certifiable humans”.  The black cop was not so much innovative, but instead was recognizing what people do to each other, in one way or another.

        The way the city has managed to keep these nice neighborhoods alive is by having the police keep the blacks in their ghettos.
That’s what they do in Paris. You rarely see blacks in the nice areas, the police would boot them out and be none too gentle about it.

        Huh. I thought the “Bodymore”, “Murderland” thing was just onThe Wire. I reckon it’s like the chicken/egg question. But I’m kinda un-exposed to diverse cultures. I thought “Cheerio” was just in old Brit movies and breakfast cereal until a Brit I worked with said it, one day. If I remain unexposed to diversity any more than I already have been, that will be just frikkin’ fine with me. I had enough diversity to last me the rest of my life in 1969.

        Considering the previous post (ie “you should consume local or you’re a douche bag”) and the fact you live in Baltimore is very interesting.I though you were in a relatively safe region of the US, relatively right wing, where you can expect a future, where the public debt isn’t in bankrupt territory, and where social programs didn’t reach the critical mass.But in fact you live in one of the worst area. One of the most leftist, black, and indebted area.And you are still willing to support all that.As you said in your previous post : “[your] friends and neighbors will eventually return the favor.”With a bankrupt city, a mountain of public debt, a horde of rabid leftists looking to skin some republicans.

        Last I knew about it, Chicago was a similar story.  But why not Boston_?  Have all the low IQ, low impulse control folks been displaced elsewhere_?
It has been reported that Chicago hoped to fix the problem by dispersing them downstate and to Iowa.  The murder stats show that this plan is not working.

        Z-Man, I’ve heard it both as “Bodymore, Murderville” and Bodymore, Murderland”. “Murderland” sounds closer to “Maryland” to my ears. Great post.

        Connect the dots. There is a painfully obvious problem. Elected politicians do not (and cannot) adequately address the problem. The victims continually re-elect failing leadership. The problem perpetuates (and worsens).
The root of this problem lies within the voting population itself. Voting patterns are habitual and cannot change unless the population changes, or the voting rules are changed, or the crisis reaches epic proportions (murder rate must go up at least another order of magnitude or two).
The rational response is to either leave town or purchase lots of firepower; everything else is distraction masturbation.

        I’d say that Boston, similar in population, is approaching apples and oranges in its racial makeup. The lower class, of all races, has mostly been pushed out of Boston proper and the former white ghettos. The high crime black ghetto is the Brockton area. Everett and Malden have assumed Chelsea and East Boston’s hispanic trouble makers (MS-13),But Roxbury is still Roxbury, but changing fast, Dorchester is gentrified for the most part, but these two places are where the cops spend most of their outreach and where the body count is measured. I didn’t do the math, but taken on their own Roxbury and Dorchester per capita probably have a similar murder and behavior problem as Bodymore and other majority black ghettos.

            At one point in my life I repossessed cars in places like Mattapan and Roxbury. At their worst, they were nothing like West Baltimore. I’ve taken friends from Boston on ghetto tours and they are dumbfounded by what they see.

        One of the numbers (or racial identification) in paragraph #9 of “The Killing Season” must be wrong, because it doesn’t make sense as written.  I’m guessing that 90% of the victims are black, not white.

            “Equality” is always the goal stated (initially).  Once these movements reach parity with “the other”, they inevitably metastasize into exactly that which they once claimed was evil.
When anything is modified with “justice”, replace it with “revenge” to understand the unspoken goal.

            Trent, here’s some condescending advice from a white man of vast privilege:  Get off twitter and your bs “brotha” blogs, and try reading a real book.  I suggest you start with William Faulkner – how about “Absalom, Absalom”? It might actually broaden your stereotypical lefty perspective, which is silly, pinched and butt ignorant.  You ain’t “woke” bro, you’re just a parrot in a cage.

            Or we could be reasonable and review…The Talk: Nonblack Versionhttp://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/printIt’s by the way that an overwhelming majority of American blacks demonstrate a perennial devotion to organized criminality. Most of them vote leftist every two years. Right on cue. The same majority of blacks is a little too friendly to Islamic theocracy, too, and this in spite of the fact that many of them claim to be Christians.It’s also by the way that Mr. Derbyshire has written a fascinating account of the life and work of Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann. SeePrime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics.If you’re in a mood to get out of your own echo chamber, it would behoove you to see also the Wikipedia entry for Riemannian geometry. You will find that the topic is important to general relativity and, thus, to an accurate description of your body without the burdensome prejudice of presentism.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry

            Trent, I gave you a vote-up, raising your total from -17 to -16, because I think it’s mean of everyone to down-vote you and you clearly like Zman and a lot of his posters or you wouldn’t come back.  Have you read the Lord of the Rings?  I like everyone who’s read the Lord of the Rings.

            I actually have. They are in a short morons. Intersectionalism is about the most stupid ideology ever, even outright Marxism of the economic sort is smarter than that since it can produce some goods

                Intersectionalism = the compound interest of Cultural Marxism’s Critical Theory.Trent – I am curious to know how many additional hundreds of years you estimate will be required before the “pernicious effects of slavery” are rendered negligible?  Given your concerns of “White privilege/supremacy” I suspect you would say that they never will until Whites are debased into an impoverished underclass….in the nation their ancestors built when it was 90% White.Since non-Whites will risk their lives to get into our nations, perhaps the question you should be asking is what mental illnesses are these non-Whites suffering from that leads them to go to such lengths to be oppressed and ruled over by irremediable racists?  Clearly you’re an immigration restrictionist as well.But we both know you want more immigration…the browner/poorer/more foreign the better.  Thus you merely want to see Whites crushed.  Whatever your reasons are interest me little, but assuming you got your wish, and are not a member of the tribe, one only need look at the European ruins in their former African colonies to picture your rainbow utopia USA.  There are skyscrapers built by the Belgians in Kinshasa, Zaire which function as multistory mud huts.  The infrastructure/elevators failed long ago under the weight of 75 IQ high time preferences.White privilege = a tiny global minority who is expected to be the world’s bank, police man, and hospital, and being labeled as evil for the privilege.We’re already called Nazis.  So if I am doing the time, why not do the crime?

                    all these studies are gibberish.  Objectively blacks cannot compete on a level playing field, and even when given all the tools necessary to succeed, they cannot succeed.  See Detroit, Camden, Newark, Cleveland, New Orleans, Haiti, etc..
Objective reality trumps ivory tower philosophy.

            Trent Denton is correct. Everyone reading this blog should read Leonard Pitts and VSB. And it will shift your view. You will soon come to recognized that there exists no set of facts upon which the failure of black people can’t be blamed on white people. Having grown up dirt poor in the rural Midwest, I was quite sympathetic to the plight of black people who were treated unfairly by the man. No more.Check out this beauty at VSB:http://verysmartbrothas.com/of-course-the-officer-who-killed-philando-castile-was-acquitted-because-nigger-hunting-season-is-always-here/Contrast this with the transcript from final 74 seconds before shooting:9:05 p.m. — Castile’s vehicle comes to a stop.9:05:15-9:05:22 — Yanez approaches vehicle on driver’s side.9:05:22-9:05:38: — Yanez leans at driver’s side window, greets Castile, tells him of brake light problem.9:05:33 — Officer Joseph Kauser approaches vehicle on passenger side, stands near rear door.9:05:38 — Yanez asks for driver’s license and proof of insurance.9:05:48 — Castile provides proof of insurance.9:05:49-9:05:52 — Yanez glances at card, tucks it into outer pocket.9:05:52-9:05:55 — Castile tells Yanez: “Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me.” Castile interrupts to say “OK” and places right hand on holstered gun.9:05:55-9:06:02 — Yanez says, “OK, don’t reach for it, then.” Castile says, “I’m … I’m … (inaudible) reaching … Yanez interrupts to say, “Don’t pull it out.” Castile says: “I’m not pulling it out.” His girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, says, “He’s not pulling it out.” Yanez shouts: “Don’t pull it out!” Yanez draws his gun with right hand while reaching inside driver’s window with left. Yanez removes left arm from car, fires seven shots, the last at 9:06:02.Both the cop and Castile’s girlfriend testified that the gun was in the same pocket into which he was reaching. Conservative Treehouse even has a high-res photo:https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/07/13/philando-castile-wallet-positioned-underneath-visible-hand-gun/By all means, read VSB!

            Tiny Duck, you really should stick to one sock puppet.  Your diction and recommendations are quite distinctive and easily identifiable, particularly for those of us who routinely read more than one online information source.
You forgot to add the bit about White women bearing non-White children and feelz.  No worries; we can all fill in the blanks.

            The current mayor of Baltimore is a black woman, the previous mayor was  a black woman, and since 1996 the U.S. congressman has been Elijah Cummings.  So much for white supremacy, white privilege and the legacy of slavery.
