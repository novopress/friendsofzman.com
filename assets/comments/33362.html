        Jessica Phillips is the so-called “Minister for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls” in so-called Britain. Under its Orwellian regime, that means the exact opposite. That means she endorses Pakistani rape gangs molesting White children. In addition, as an Outer Party loyalist, she promotes the on-going genocide of the White race.
Who is she anyway? Is she some kind of darkie, or is she a White masochist? Let me do a google search. Oh, I see. Another degenerate White feminist. She would be right at home in our Democratic Party. She is too ugly for the Pakis to rape.

            To be fair, the title is “Minister for Violence Against Women.” So technically she’s doing her job.

        Unfortunately, Carter sucked up to bloody despots for free. Whether that’s better or worse than doing it for money  I leave up to you to decide.

            Uh, worse. It’s not even worthy of a rhetorical question. Those bloody despots are typically tinpot dictators. First rule of power at the national leader level is you don’t kowtow to people lower than yourself.

            I’ll add the caveat that I have become very skeptical when the MSM labels somebody a bloodthirsty dictator. I’ve come to believe that almost everything they said about Saddam Hussein was false, to try to sell us on the war.

                Yeah, or that the person in question “used poison gas.”  They said that about Hussein and then Assad.  Some coincidence.

        It’s a popular misconception that people who do evil things must be “crazy”.  Most of them are simply evil – a fact our society is terrified of addressing.

        I followed Derb’s link above (text: “follow the link”)  to one of his older columns and there was a mention of Janssen Carepath. I was just curious and went searching for some info about Janssen.Just wow. They have done the most extreme search engine optimization I have ever seen. Page after page after page until I got tired of clicking (which is what they hope, I’m sure), of links directly to Janssen or associated companies telling you about how they work with Janssen, no matter what you search about regarding them (add in “fraud,” “criticism,” “reviews,” etc. and almost nothing turns up except the corporate links.One of the only exceptions I found was that they were sued for a data breach a while back.If you want to understand Janssen’s business model or economics, or if there are any red flags, or independent customer reviews and experiences, you are straight out of luck.Which makes me deeply suspicious.We have very little curious investigative journalism in the world right now.

        NOOO!  That can’t be the last derb’s diary!!  Think about your fans who have nothing else to look forward to in our miserable lives.  How could he do this to us??  Derb’s diary was an interlude of light and sanity and order which started the month for us.  I will truly miss it.  It was unique contribution to the world, much as the writings of Martin Gardner, if not much better.  Hail and farewell!ps.  I thought of the same passage of Confucius when I heard of Biden’s pardon of Hunter.  The version I read had Confucius saying, “where I come from a son doesn’t testify against his father.”

            James Legge’s translation (1893 edition), which was my first acquaintance with the sage, says: “The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father.”
However, I strongly favor Simon Leys for Confucius translation. Leys originally got me with “A man is not a pot.” (Legge: “The accomplished scholar is not a utensil.”) Then, years later, he got me all over againhttps://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Diaries/2021-03.html#05….
