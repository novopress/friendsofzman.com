        There’s recently been a sequel to an 80s movie named “Beetlejuice”. Title of the sequel: “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice”.So, Derb, why not call the sequel to your book, “We Are Doomed, Doomed!”?Watch Derb talking about and being interviewed about his 2009 book here:https://www.c-span.org/video/?289565-1/we-doomed-reclaiming-conservative-pessimism

        Because Israel is an outpost of Western Civilization in a region with much barbarism, I regard those funds as a sort of civilization tax. I’m aconservative, a big fan of Western civ.i had an argument with someone who in their capacity as a Christian classical teacher (they are popping up like mushrooms) claims to be “saving western civilization “. After years of interactions with this person I asked if western civilization can subsist in china, for the sake of argument.”oh yes” was my interlocutors reply.there seem to be many whites who have a sort of materialist mindset that the body is a dumb machine or hardware that info is downloaded into like software.the earliest Jews know to contribute to “white “ civilization (if I’m going to be consistent with my terms) was Spinoza .I know there is Hebrew philosophy but it’s just that, theirs. Spinoza seems to be the first Jew who is considered to be a white philosopherthen Felix Mendelssohn may be the next western Jew. Mendelssohn gets a pass but I’m not sure how helpful Spinoza was .arius was suppose to be a Jew but I don’t think it’s for certain

            The objection is that it’s not true, not that Jews and what they do maybe are or aren’t Western or white or European or whatever. Some yes, some no.Israel isnot. It’s like its neighbors, an ancient-brained military state so foreign to the Anglo mind that we can’t accurately observe it, so barbaric we don’t even recognize its behavior as human—so we lie about it, whitely.They’re us, but physically besieged.We’d do the same. In fact, worse!They don’t think so. They don’t think “G-d” thinks so. Got any stories like Pesach aboutyou, goy? Masada, even?“Gaza,” all that’s happened since 10/7, is Israel’s abandonment of its whiteness, a bloody celebration of its Middle Eastern freedom from, not least,Ashkenazi judgment, its becoming-Israeli. American Jews’ attempt at a color revolution failed. Israel has exited globohomo.Good for them. Unfortunate for the nearby tribes that are indistinguishable from them.

                They’re fighting to win. They are FIGHTING TO WIN. This is the sort of war the US would’ve had to fight to win in iraq or afghanistan or vietnam, which we didn’t (whether that makes us civilized or massive fucking pussies is up for devate.) Regardless, this is traditionally how wars were fought until we decided not to do it anymore in the west. I think it’s brutal and disgusting but you need to concede that this is wars true face.

            i’m of the opinion that western civ is hard-coded into europeans and those descended from them (genetic, and culture flowing from the genetics)Trying to “spread western civ” is the same as “spreading democracy”. Foolish and just a continuation of the white mans burden. The people of the middle east are biologically incompatible with democracy, as far as I can tell.But the more important bit is this; we owe these people nothing. Not only that but they also have a right to live as they see fit in their own damned countries. If they want to live like “savages”, it’s none of our concern. We should deport them all back and let them live as they deserve.derb an isolationist? Don’t make me laugh, spouting neoconservative talking points like that.

            Happily Mr. Derbyshire seems familiar with disappointment since on this issue it’s coming down the track at him like a runaway train.  There may have been a point between the 1968 War and the Yom Kippur War when Israel.could have arranged matters with its neighbors so as to make its continued existence sustainable.
But it (perhaps inevitably) chose another path.  Predictable Islamic development (especially Persian and Turish), Western withdrawal and the Iron Law of demography say that Israel is Doomed.
Daniel Bernard Respecter is obviously fine with that😀

            Voting is to give consent to the charadethey keep lying to voters yet the voters keep lining up for more. Battered wife syndrome.Now if you’re a politician would you hold these voters in contempt, as a cheating husband does for a doormat wife?  Or would you totally respect them?common sense.If they want your vote make them work for it and earn it. Show some self respect.  If they don’t want to work for it, then refuse to participate.  Let them win elections with 25% voter participation.  Let them try to assume legitimacy with that kind of minimal consent.that is the only real power we have at this point

                As far as voting, it depends upon where you live. If you live in California, boycotting the vote should be you main weapon, as it is the only weapon available to you. If you live in Pennsylvania, then you should vote early and often for Republicans as part of your defense strategy. You should also get involved in local politics to head off the Republicans cucks and stop liberal shitheads from getting a foothold. If you live in Alabama, then you need to support a right-wing third party in order to keep the cucks under control.

                    We can vote our way out of this, just not in the way that CivNat G. Normiecon thinks. Because he’s a retard. Voting isn’t a right, nor is it some patriotic gift from the Constitution. It’s a weapon. Wield it like one, because our enemies do.

                        “We can vote our way out of this.”
Please explain. What does getting “out of this” mean to you?
Part of the foundation of my revolutionary outlook is my speculation that the highest goal our current media and government is the dispossession of whites, especially men with traditional values. They are very sensitive to any threat to their goal.
Am I too cynical?

                            First and foremost, a vote for Trump is a vote for civil war, initiated by the left. They are absolutely terrified now, and that is going to get to levels that will make 2020 look positively sane if it appears he will be elected. Every disaster, foreign and domestic, of the last four years, plus the new ones (natural and ones of their own making) are going to be laid at the feet of the Regime and nothing is stopping that.

                    Say you know football. You know all the players, the coaches – you gather all the player performance data.
But let’s say the results of the contest won’t be decided until 5 days after the game is over, after it has been reviewed by a team of experts.
Would you still gamble on the game?
