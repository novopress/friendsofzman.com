        If you were to ask an American to name a corrupt country, he would most likely pick one from what we used to call the third world.
I haven’t read any farther in the post than this, yet, but the first country that comes to mind for me is the US.

            If you look at corruption in terms of dark money exchanged between various political and financial players, there simply are no real competitors to America. The situation in Ukraine is just one (glaring) example of the money laundering schemes being played out in D.C. Russian oligarchs are children compared to the monsters we have over here.

                There is also the idea that US corruption is so much more consequential because of the US’s role in the world. Turkmenistan is ridiculously corrupt, but … who cares, really? It doesn’t affect anyone outside Turkmenistan.
Most of our leadership class leave a slime trail when they cross a room, and that’s disastrous for the world as well as for US citizens. And because of globalist influence, the pocketbook of the US citizen is the world’s candy jar.

                    It’s kind of the opposite (for now): because of the dollar’s reserve currency status, the world is the ZOG’s candy jar.

                        Well, it’s both. Anyone trying to participate in the legitimate productive economy anywhere in the world has ZOG’s tentacles in his pocket. Whether you’re a plumber in Peoria or a Philippino buying a pack of cigarettes the ZOG is profiting from you. The plumber is getting taxed to death by the Feds and state and thePhilippino, if he uses dollars, is driving up demand for the dollar and thus funding the ZOG and the GAE.This means that there’s a huge amount of the world’s wealth being consumed by the ZOG elite who produce nothing of value in return. Indeed, they produce “negative value” by sponsoring revolution and terrorism around the world. For example, they are almost 100% responsible for the Ukraine conflict. Without them sponsoring the 2014 color revolution, the Ukraine would not have tried to join NATO and Russia would not have invaded. Getting rid of these parasites alone could lead to a huge economic boon for the whole world.

            Z is being pugilistic today. As much as I loath the regime, we are not the most corrupt country in the world. We are transitioning to Brazilian or Mexican levels of corruption, which seems real bad since we were probably on Netherlands level a couple generations ago. I’d much rather live here than about 75% of other countries, including China or the UK.And we still have a free press…unlike China, Western leadership understands that you don’t need to censor ALL information, just astroturf as much as possible. People will tend to believe the person on TV, and the rest can be belittled as cranks by the regime and by your family and friends.

                    “Not the least free in the world” is not synonymous with “free.”The foreign elite that rules over us is far more media-savvy than that. Just as I say in my post below where I say that elections will never be cancelled in the US, they’ll always maintain a veneer of “freedom,” just as the UK does, while still controlling the vast majority of media narrative and demonizing people who talk about things like Kaczynski’s memo. Gulaging you for Googling that is for incompetent regimes. Things are trending badly, though, as our regime does become increasingly less competent, such as the prosecution of Douglas Mackey, and the outright calls for censorship on X.

                        This is essentially what I was going to say. In fact, I’d put the US in its own special category when it comes to media censorship. The American elite has hadgenerations, starting in WWII, to develop a unique cultural mythology using TV, movies, music, books, newspapers, and basically everything else that people consume that tells any kind of story. They basically re-invented American history and nationalism in a way that bore almost no resemblance to the way people, even in the 1930s, saw themselves.It’s really quite ingenious. This is why boomers, while “conservative”, are often the hardest to reach with news of the elite’s malfeasance. They overwhelmingly vote for the “R” AND take the Coof jab, because “vaccines are a modern miracle”. It takes a very strong mind to flush a lifetime’s worth of multi-media regime narratives.By contrast, even the UK elite is less slick and polished about narrative control. This is why they lock up their equivalent of Trumpers for pointing out obvious things about the harms caused by allowing Britain to be overrun by Pakis and Africans. Look at the continent and it’s even less subtle. Around the same time the US began it’s multi-generational mythology revisionism, the Germans just outright banned political parties and “hate speech”. Similar laws were adopted all over “free” Europe.Of course, this means that the pozzed ideology and taboos are less well rooted in people’s minds in nations that enforce them using the law rather than subtle multi-media narrative. As the GAE retracts to its national borders (and then hopefully less than that), I predict that a European country will break with Globohomo in a spectacular way and thus open the floodgates that will sweep Europe and probably lead to the end of the EU and NATO.

                    Ok, ‘bro’ — does the press serve The Regime?
If yes, not “free.”
Yes, you can peer under some rocks online, but Joe Normie does not even know to peer, let alone where — leaving him the Regime Press only.
And thus, it is not ‘free’ nor is he.

                        I suppose I’m using “free press” broadly as in: anyone can write anything they want and distribute it. Whether it’s popular or mainstream is another matter. We all found Z-man because there’s a free press and we can find him with little effort, if we are the type that looks for novel political opinion.I just Googled “the Z blog” and it came right up, even above the SPLC warnings.Yes, people get buried in the search results and yes, leftists will Dox you for wrongthink and yes, Andrew Anglin will never get a column in the WSJ. Does that mean we don’t have a free press? Not at all. It means that like every other regime in the history of mankind, they would much prefer that we read Peggy Noonan, and they guess correctly that most people – whom we call “normies” – will read Peggy Noonan, rub their midwit chins, and feel smarter for it.So it seems to me that the commenters here are lamenting the fact that their favorite writer(s) aren’t hired by the Sulzbergers, ergo: we live in Soviet America.

                Sure, there are lots of places I would not want to live in comparison to America. But they are really not because of a corruption index.Saying we have a free press by comparing it to China is like saying we don’t have a police state because people don’t disappear in the middle of the night like they did in the Soviet Union or because we don’t harvest their organs or have mobile death vans like they do in China.It’s easy to look good when the comparisons are some of the worst regimes in the world of the last 120 years.The real comparison is with the past.  We used to have a somewhat free press, we no longer do.  We used to have a reasonably transparent and fair system of laws and we no longer do.

                I don’t know, Marko. If you watch the Tucker Carlson interview the other day with Rod Blagojevich, it’s apparent that something is gone horribly wrong in this country. Of course, we might not know all the details, but for somebody to get railroaded like that and what is supposed to be America.

                “since we were probably on Netherlands level a couple generations ago”
A couple of generations would be fifty or sixty years ago. The USA was crooked even then. Politicians have always been available for hire. Policy has been in the hands of an oligarchy for maybe a century. There’s always been one law for the rich, another for the poor. Ted Kennedy didn’t go to prison for Chappaquiddick. The one thing you can say is that the crookedness is more ubiquitous and more overt now than before, and there’s a lot more cynicism around.

                    I’d wager that elections will never be canceled. Even North Korea has regular elections, as does China. Canceling the elections is for the incompetent authoritarian regimes. You don’t need to cancel the election when you simply control who is on the ballot, who counts the votes, and who gets time in the media.

                        China doesn’t have elections, at least not one where the people are able to cast a vote.  They have some sham they call “Whole-process people’s democracy” where members of the Politburo can vote.But I do agree with you that they will never be cancelled.  No need for such a drastic move.  Elections change nothing.

So they are slick enough just to make ‘elections’ not be what most people think they are. Result: one party state.

                Generally, but there are exceptions. Japan and Singapore, for instance. But they never would have been considered Third World nations anyway. Third World to me was always the “Global South” populated my Negroes, Negritoes, Arabs, Subcontinentals, and mestizos, generally not Asians, although of course China and Vietnam had a fair share of corruption.

        The country’s full transition to a South America-style country will come with the passing of the Boomers – and GenX. They are both the last generations to remember the old America, and they will cling to that memory.
Obviously, the Boomers are a much larger generation so once they go, the process will start in earnest, but the Xers will keep the flame going until they pass. Then, the US will be full South America and no one will have ever known anything different.

            It’s been a long time since I’ve spent any time there, but it seemed like they practiced a more honest and egalitarian style of corruption in Mexico. Most everything was for sale, to anyone. Whereas the AINO flavor of corruption requires both the right connections and the right ideology, it’s not just about straight cash money. Indeed, in AINO, unlike in Mexico, you’d likely be jailed for offering a bribe, if you hadn’t established the proper prior relationships, and paid your bribe through the appropriate established channels, in which case it’s not just ok but encouraged. Whereas in Mexico you can bribe any cop or most any govt official and it’s expected. Just another tax you pay.

                Yeah, that’s pretty much the distinction between totalitarian and authoritarian. Ideological requirements are placed on blatant bribery along with everything else in the former. Without getting into the weeds, it explains why totalitarian systems murder infinitely more people than fascist ones. The “total” part is key.

                    Great description. But the ideological requirements will be difficult to impose on non-whites. They simply don’t care nor are they bright enough to follow the ideological rules, which, admittedly change all the time. Indians are smart enough to follow those rules but have zero respect for them so will disregard them whenever possible.It’s why it’s so hard to impose ideological rule in non-white, non-Asian countries. They simply won’t stick to the rules. They can’t stick to the rules.In the US, those ideological restraints are only really imposed on whites. Occasionally, they are imposed on the token blacks and Hispanics put into positions of power like Harvard’s Gay. As whites fall as a percent of the population, it will harder and harder to impose ideological restraints.

                It’s the same in Bolivia. There is a price for everything, and when you get the hang of it, it all works: How much to pay a cop to throw a squatter off your property, for example, or to overlook your bogus “speeding” violation, etc. Straightforward graft – refreshing, non-ideological, and no paperwork. I love it. Compare this to what happens when you run afoul of the NYS police. These jacked-up gorillas order you to stay in your car, then spend twenty minutes in their patrol car, eventually mosey on back to you and hand you an appearance ticket. All “on the up and up”, and when the matter is concluded, you’re out $300. Shit, in Bolivia the whole thing is resolved with a $20 bill.If graft is the real purpose of government work, at least that’s efficiency and cost cutting.

            Citizen-
I think there is a small sliver of early Xers that will pass into retirement with the Boomers.
I also think that the mid and late Xers will largely be passed over. I sat this because the few notable Xers out there are all from the early part of that generation.

        A long time ago, in a foreign country, I was chatting with an acquaintance who was a citizen thereof. Being a much more naive civnat back then, I said something about the lack of corruption in the USA relative to most of the rest of the world. I still remember the guffaw and incredulity of the fellow. One of those moments that stays with you. He pointed out that they had institutionalized the corruption and called it campaign contributions, and of course I had no rebuttal because he was correct. Of course nowadays they don’t even bother policing those “contributions” anymore (if they ever really did) to see that they are adhering to the letter or spirit of the law, it is open season for buying politicians, votes, anyone. Regime media does not even pretend to care about the subject, they just ignore it now.But that being said, I think it used to be mostly true, or a lot more true. I know there were communities of honest white people with good intentions that were mostly corruption free, because I grew up in one, and I knew the people personally. It’s not my imagination. They were not putting on some show of piety and decency, while behind closed doors doing every depraved thing. The piety and decency were really who they were. I’m not sure I see that so much anymore. Or rather, nowadays piety and decency are support for unlimited abortion and drag queen story hour.Moreover, when these latter day “pious” and “decent” people denounce their political opposition as HITLER, it gives them license to do all manner of corrupt things. Any means are justified, against HITLER. This is more insidious and subconsciously pervasive than is often appreciated. You are morally obligated to steal an election from HITLER. Morally obligated to circumvent every campaign finance law. Morally obligated to wage lawfare against HITLER’s supporters. So in that fighting HITLER, you can become something worse.It can be a self fulfilling prophecy, since there really isn’t any other way to deal with the people who scream HITLER than shoving them into ovens. They certainly are no longer fit to participate in a “democracy.” To function as such, democracy requires gracious losing, but there can be no gracious losing to HITLER. So what on earth are we supposed to do with these folks? They didn’t start screaming HITLER with Trump, and they won’t stop it when he’s gone.

            MartyrMade had an insightful “tweet” about the ongoing genocide in Gaza, to the effect that the Israeli government’s position was NOT, “Because of Oct. 7, we HAVE to do this,” but rather: “Because of Oct. 7, we GET to do this.”That formulation could apply to a lot to situations, and it’s a special favorite of the left—as your smart comment about them turning every opponent into “Hitler” shows. The position they bully society into holding is that against a Hitler, restraint is not a virtue, and it may even be immoral. Any atrocity would be justified—and will eventually be unleashed if lefty is allowed to have her way.But there’s also something else happening in the culture (and again MartyrMade has delivered the crucial insight). And that is that people (how many I don’t know) are getting tired of the promiscuous use of the “Hitler” label. If telling a joke can earn you that label, then who hasn’t “earned” it? And if that’s the case, then why should that denunciation be so fatal? Some people are starting to wonder aloud whether Hitler himself was really the “Hitler” he was cracked up to be.

            What are we supposed to do with these folks?   Well, there is no living with them, although plenty here apparently still try (old friends, insanerelatives).  No, they won’t stop their insanity – ever.  You can move away, but they will follow – or send in a few thousand Venezuelans or Haitians or Mauritanians.  Even if AINO were to break up along racial and ideological lines, you’d be facing endless economic and military conflict with the left – as in the Covington books (boycotts, trade embargoes, militarized border, espionage incursions, etc.).Which is why I’ve repeatedly stated my belief that nothing will change short of notsee-scale population purges, which most people don’t have the stomach for.  So either nature eventually effects a long overdue culling of the least fit and most spiteful, or we continue our march towards 1984 crossed with Brave New World crossed with Harrison Bergeron.  Or our march willresult in such chaos that nature steps in.  Either way we end up with decades of strife and misery, and without sufficient smart White people to effect a long, slowrebuild.No, I’m not hopeful about the future on earth.  I don’t believe anyone who honestly studies history andrealistically observes human nature can be.  So we do what little we can to equip our progeny for the coming deluge, knowing all the while that man proposes and God disposes.

Having said that, it’s ironic that they treat me with far more condescention and disrespect than I do them.
I guess it’s like the tragic ending of that wonderful kids’ book “Old Yeller.” The beloved dog’s body is made insane by rabies.

My family is my husband and kids.  We miss a few close friends, but otherwise we are content enough.  Some people seem able to let all the discord slide and have fun based on past remembrances or a few shared interests.  I just jettison the people and the drama -but I am blessed with a wonderful husband.

                    While I’ve seen a dismaying trickle of non-Whites into our area, I haven’t seen a single Kamala sign – neither in our tiny town and extended area, nor in the bigger small town where one of our sons lives.  Of course, out here in the woods not too many people are going to see any signs, although a few people still put them out.

                        I’ve seen a ton of Kamala yard signs in my extremely deep blue state (compared to the number of Biden signs in 2020). but almost no Kamala bumper stickers.  Interpret that as you will…

                i agree.  the culling not so much.  the kind of men performing the act of culling the population, are the same men who qualify for culling.  there is no gain when mans actions reduce him to the very thing he despises.  better to maintain the moral code and lead the way for those who have wandered.  being mindful of the very likely event that no civil men found america.  fortunately america is vast nation and going remote not that difficult.  not the most pleasant idea for men past their prime.  thinking better for me to re-locate (with the wealth not yet taken), to a recent war torn country. with men who have experienced the trauma of war and the desire to establish and maintain civility.  cannot think of a contender country, may be stuck with digging in.

        And just like clockwork, this weekend saw the release of polls that suddenly showed the low IQ diversity hire, despite one of the worst months in Presidential campaign history, with the wind at her back.  It was always going to be like this.  The slobber fest over Harris in August, and Trump’s resurgence in the fall were always just opening acts.  All they were concerned about was entering this week with the one thing that makes an election steal possible: plausibility.And now they have it.  Even though the polls in question were horribly constructed and worthless, you will no longer be allowed to question the fortification that’s coming.  You’ll be told that the massive vote dumps that happen tonight and tomorrow are just reflections of the momentum in the polling data. Only fascists would question Our Sacred Democracy.

            Yeah, the local morning news was carelessly talking about “polls show Harris in the lead 49 to 46 percent”…but what polls though? Polls aren’t an irregular plural noun like “shrimp”.
“Shrimp may contain food-borne illness, say scientists.”

            Real Clear Polling has Trump up by about a percent in battleground states.    Harris up by 0.1 nationally.  Who knows?  The final RCP wrapup in 2020 had Biden winning nationally by 7 but the actual number was 4.5.  And when it comes down to it, a 2020  swing of 40,000 votes in battleground states would have given Trump an EC victory.   The cheating and rigging wasn’t wide spread and it didnt have to be.   Probably the same today and we will have this embarrassingly stupid women to listen to for at least 4 years.

                The story so far appears to be Democrats staying home.  Early voting is way down for them in key states.  Ballot box stuffing at a certain level depends on a foundation of legitimate votes.
But as Z points out, if you believe voting is way down, I have some murder, crime, inflation, and jobs stats for you, lol.
A lot of people are now counting on Republicans to show up big today.  Maybe get Trump above the fraud margin.  I don’t know.  I just don’t know.
its not like one election is going to stop the shipwreck.

            I understand and am sympathetic to all your concerns.  However, be of good cheer ya men of the DR.  A steal of the election would be even more blatant than the former steal in 2020. Such events wake up the populous–those who can be awakened anyway.
Trump can not right the ship in 4 years, he can only serve to delay the inevitable and make it more painful in the end.  When the platform of one or more parties in a future election actually start to talk about ignored problems and painful solutions will there be hope for real change.

        The USA is in many ways worse than many third world countries, especially in the cities. Given the choice, I’d rather live in Mexico City than San Francisco or Los Angeles. At least in Mexico City the government knows where its bread is buttered. They don’t have the insane anarcho-tyranny that we are all suffering under.Do people know how bad it has gotten? I think on some level they do, but I am also tired of reading boomer-tier stuff like “durrr those libtards in NYC get what they voted for.” The fact that our cities are in such shabby and decrepit shape reflects badly on all of us. We should ALL be ashamed that tourists are coming from around the globe and getting stabbed by Venezuelan migrants in our premier, global city. Look at cities in China and the Middle East and they look like they are from Mass Effect. NYC looks like a dump and the government works for the dregs of society and punishes the normal people. This is not acceptable. We end up with this bizarre and horrifying mixture of third world people who are protected by a hostile ruling class that is eager to make our lives miserable.

            A few days ago when some midwestern Jew “on his way to synagogue” (seriously?) got shot by a recent Muslim import, not one conservative said “He voted for this”—the one time it was definitely true.There’s at least a 90% chance hepaid for it.But whenever some teenage girl gets torture-murdered by Aztecs, the anti-white-woman bots/jeets can’t keep up with the actual Republicans flooding the tubes with “She voted for this”—then going right back to knowing that elections are fake.“Revealed preference” is truly stupid economic idea. Peoplecannotbuy what they want. But it does apply to some other things.

            “We should ALL be ashamed…”I’m not ashamed because it’s not my country. It’s a node of control of those who raped and murdered my country. America the country is a corpse, and what NYC has become is not demographically American. If globohomo gets into a war with a nuclear power and NYC gets nuked, I probably won’t literally be dancing in the streets for fear of getting on a globohomo death squad target list, but I will surely be celebrating in private. Same thing for Los Angeles: if it gets nuked, well sucks for the Jews and Mexicans who live there now. Oh, well. Not my people, not my country. We just share police state database entries together.

                if the cities are not ours, then it is because they were stolen from us, and that is even worse. It was stolen by hostile foreigners who can leave when things get too bad, while for us, this is our only home. Worse, though, they use the accrued power and influence of those cities to do horrible things both home and abroad, and do it in your name. I mean, if this year has proven anything, it is that there is no corner of the United States that is safe from the same dynamics and machinations that led to the downfall of these cities. Whatever they have done to NYC and LA and Houston, they are doing to suburban Ohio, rural Alabama, you name it. It’s not 1973 anymore, Americans can’t just pack up and move 20 miles down the highway to get away from it.

            Spot-on comment. When I was in Times Square earlier this year, the two competing odors on an otherwise pleasant evening were pot smoke and human shit. The last big city I was in, Santiago de Chile, in what amounts to that city’s commercial and tourist hub, the cleanliness was striking, almost “fake”. Who knew that a city the size of Los Angeles could be so clean?

        This election feels like the Battle of the Bulge in WWII when Team G mustered everything they had and threw it against the wall in desperation.
Some initial successes, but the end was never in doubt.
Forlorn hopes are tragic for a reason.
I can’t believe this election is even close.  But the convergence of managerialism, population replacement, ideological court packing, and media dominance has reached a tipping point.
Hope T wins.  Hope they try.  But some forces are larger than mere men.

                Much of the population in America today is insane/deranged.   As they stated in their video they believe anyone who is a Trump supporter is a traitor and their enemy.    Since that is the case they will not have a problem kinetically dealing them.  All that is needed is the right officials in place to start the party.
You can now see this in Israel where about 80% of the population supports ethnically cleansing Gaza to include killing them all if needed.

        Went to vote this morning. We have town council elections which actually matter and aren’t rigged. And, yes, I did vote for Trump even though I know that he won’t “drain the swamp” or pretty much anything else other than being more pro-Israel than AIPAC. But he’s a one of a kind. My presidential vote was my goodbye wave to our past.Anyway, looking at how the women, liberal-looking men and the very few minorities far outnumbered normal-looking men, you can see how there’s no hope for democracy. (And this is in a very white, fairly conservative town.) Everyone there was proud to vote; I was just shaking my head that anyone ever thought that this could work.

                True, but the fact that a majority of voters are women and non-white shows that democracy is and aways destined to fail. It’s stunning that anyone thought otherwise.

Nicely phrased. While it had been true for a very long time, I came to peace with the reality that the United States was officially hot garbage the day after the 2020 “election.” The stupidity and blatant ham-handedness of that affair pretty well served as a tombstone finally delivered to the gravesite after a family member finally scratched up the jack a generation or more after the death.

            “…looking at how the women, liberal-looking men and the very few minorities far outnumbered normal-looking men, you can see how there’s no hope for democracy.”Depends how you define “democracy”.  If it’s along the line…”everyone who fogs a mirror has a vote”, then no, democracy has no future.  This I agree with.On the other hand, the inventors of “democracy”–the ancient Athenians–had no such illusions. They wished to avoid the worst form of governance–Tyranny–but were under no illusion as to the ability of the average member of the Vox populi to decide societal matters.The problem is getting there from here.

                The problem is that there’s a natural push in any limited democracy to expand the vote.
Basically, there is no perfect system. Saying that democracy where the vote is limited to productive members of society is best is like saying that fall should be the only season of the year in Maine. Nature isn’t going to allow that.

                    Then we go to another form of rule. What can’t be bent, must be broken.
It really makes no difference to me.  If the very concept of “democracy”–even corrected as I proposed–is flawed and therefore doomed to eventual failure, then recommend an alternate.  However ignoring or nay saying the issue as you have via voting, then saying that the process is ultimately unfixable seems a logical inconsistency.

                        I disagree.  The logical inconsistency is believing that there is some sort of system – devisable and implementable on earth by people – that willremain impervious to the ineradicable impulse of some people (and depending on ethnicity/race, many/all people) to cheat or steal or buy influence.

            The Covid lock downs convinced me that I was living in Airstrip One. Contributing factors were Waco and a populace who elected ‘the first black president’– who isn’t black.

            “We have town council elections which actually matter and aren’t rigged.”Really?  Perhaps you’re just not as cleaver as the opposition.  For example, we no longer use precinct polling locations, just voting centers–vote anywhere in the County at one of those on or before election “day(?)”.  What could go wrong?Well, in one rural (read Republican majority) district of 100k residents, they opened up *one* voting center!  Better vote by mail, or you’re gonna wait in line until you die.  Typical voter suppression tactics, which is why the tremendous push by the GOP to get everyone to vote by mail. Of course, mail in ballots are no guarantee of election integrity as well, which is why I consider the whole process entirely and hopelessly corrupted.

        Like history, the third world has become a bugaboo used by our betters to bully us into acceding to their bad governance. Anyone who has been to a so-called third world country will know how bad the comparisons are. Visiting Russia for the first time, Tucker Carlson was shocked at what a nice place Moscow was. Duh, the Cold War ended decades ago. Soviet films on YouTube might even call into question a few of our assumptions about life under communism (post-Stalin anyway). If the worst political system could somehow permit the survival of the Russian people and their culture, what does this say about our Western leaders, who seem hell-bent on our utter destruction?

        It is just assumed, as it was in the Cold War, that Western countries are largely free of corruption, mostly due to the honesty of Americans
As a former inhabitant of the Chicagoland area in Silly-nois, THAT made me laugh out loud.

        Depressing and spot on. Neither side will believe the results from tonight. Trump supporters will rightfully think they either were cheated or won by a larger margin. Regime supporters (you are correct that Harris is a mere generic brand albeit a quite stupid one) have been led to believe if they lose it is due to Russians and/or dark, odious domestic forces.Political scientists have long correlated a corrupt judicial system with what amounts to dictatorship. We are there even if that broad definition is oversimplified. The best takes on the legal situation come from Mark Steyn, a former Normiecon Griller who has become a sincerely based and crystal clear voice about to the gathering darkness. He notes Rule of Law is dead, and often asks the point of a first-rate constitution if the electoral system is fourth rate. His recent pieces on what he refers to as “The Election” are highly recommended and among the best I’ve encountered.I personally find the biggest tell to be the outright acceptance of the falsification of official statistics. The belief that dishonesty is acceptable if it benefits the State was the hallmark of the old Soviet system. Citizens there assumed official information was false and served another purpose. This is the current situation in the United States with, as you point out, elderly hold outs who believe in the system. Basically everyone else knows they are fed falsehoods.As for the propaganda organs, they always were biased but the non-stop promotion of deliberate lies is relatively new. Follow the money, as always. Oligarchs and likely intelligence services keep the traditional media afloat. I don’t think consumers believe the falsehoods as much as they want to believe them. That attitude is something that went away early on in the Soviet Union but persisted the duration of most fascist nations. The distinctions between Western outlets now and those found in more officially totalitarian nations such as North Korea are indeed minor; both as mentioned earlier are state-funded to a large degree.Full stomachs and warm houses keep people in line. This has been the case since time immemorial. What comes after those go away, and when it happens, may be clarified in the near future if not tonight. Mass migration throughout the West indicates the planned future for those already there will not be pretty.Thanks for this, Z. It was excellent.

            An older Canadian lady was my bartender at a hotel in the Far East. She told me that she had lived and worked in the States and Mexico, and at least in the latter they knew their government was a corrupt dictatorship. It didn’t offend me but I mentally blew it off as standard shitlib stuff, which it kind of was. It stuck with me, though, and over time I realized the bartender was right. That’s been a long time ago and truer now than then, but it was true then, too.

            The state funding of regime media is often done through a laundering process. Have you noticed Raytheon and Lockheed Martin advertising on TV? What on earth for? Their products are not for sale to the public. They don’t even mention any of their products in their ads. They are a regime client, they do not need to advertise on tv. What, were you going to go out and buy an F35 or a Patriot missile battery after watching their commercial that does nothing but brag about how diverse they are? They aren’t even trying to sell you anything with their commercial. No, this is the defense contractor paying tribute to the regime that funds it by taking the taxpayer money it was given and funneling it back into the regime’s media. You see the same thing with utilities advertising. Why on earth would utilities advertise? Were you going to buy your electricity from someone else? This is tribute the utility pays to the regime in return for the regional monopoly it has been granted. Same thing with big pharma. The other day I saw a Johnson and Johnson commercial that did nothing but brag about how diverse they were. Did not mention a single Johnson and Johnson product. The only name mentioned in the ad was J&amp;J, not Tylenol, not Johnson’s baby shampoo, nor any of their many other products you might buy.

                Yes, the ads/bribes are the oligarch prong. The intelligence services and so forth manipulate the editorial content to create preferred narratives. Operation Mockingbird never went out of business, and likely the investigation into it laid the ground for a more pervasive operation. I suspect that funding is underground.

            I dunno, my impression is that no one really thinks that Trump lost the vote in 2020.  Therewasa very brief effort to cast him as a sore loser.  It went nowhere and slightly smarter heads figured they shouldn’t be bringing that up anyway.  This as opposed to Hillary who sulked from losing due to some foreign scheme, a line she didn’t even believe as she never even made noise about running again.

        Just came back from the polling place. At the checkin I was checked in by the lone white man – a middle aged guy. His colleagues were the menagerie of spiteful mutants you might expect. I had my ID ready to pull out but he just told me to sign after verifying that the name was correct. I asked him if he needed my id. He gleefully said no. I replied, “You don’t need to see my id”? He smugly said, “Most certainly not.” He was smug and of course after identifying myself as the enemy he shot me a look of anger while the dreaded gum smackers too his left gave each other a look.I think the white guy must think he is going to be memorialized by sticking up for the other. He is standing up for democracy by making it so that anyone can vote. It was the perfect allegory. The self righteous white man patting himself on the back to be of assistance to the other as right next to him, they realize that he is handing them his and Our country and without ever negotiating with them some reward for his treason.Stay safe everyone. Pray that we are bought four more years to batten down the hatches and do the essential things needed to ride out the darkest of storms.

        It is remarkable how everyone assumes this election will be corrupt and stolen.  This is the legacy of 2020 when it was obvious to anyone watching that things weren’t legit.  Never before have the networks stopped reporting on the election during election night with the result unknown.In a serious country that election would have been followed by sweeping reforms to voting systems to regain integrity.  Instead, any reforms have been met by screeches of racism, Jim Crow, voter suppression, and the interference of the judiciary.Add that to the outrageous open corruption of the the FBI and the Justice Department, and the Bidens and the Clintons and its enough to give up on the whole thing.

            Before the “big steal”, (in hindsight, I realize the preparation for the big steal was being effected at that time), every precinct had a reader/proofing machine you put the ballot into. The machine was not to *tabulate*, but simply to proof read. If the ink bled through, or you used a check mark where a filled in circle was required, etc., the ballot was rejected. You then had the option to recheck your ballot, or spoil it, or discuss it with a precinct worker.Those machines were eliminated a couple of decades ago as being too expensive to replace. At that time estimated at $8M in a county with a budget of over $1B! The excuse used by the Chief County Administrator was that ballots would be examined at the main counting center downtown. Of course, then it was too late to question the voter and for them to correct errors.In any event, the big push was on for mail-in voting, which was the prize to be had. The GOP slept and when they woke up, it was too late.

            My daughter wanted to cast her first ballot in 2020 so we figured out where to go and took her ID along. Of course, no ID was required; they just  took her word for it that she was whom she said she was and was eligible to vote. This is merely one of the corrupt practices in California (they have implemented them all).

            Even in my deep red state, Harris/Walz is at the top of the ballot and Trump/Vance the 5th one down out of 10 or 12, tightly spaced enough that it took me a few seconds to find it, and it wouldn’t have been all that hard to mark the wrong bubble to the left. Even here in “friendly” territory, RFKJ is still on the ballot, 2nd position below Harris/Walz. This ballot speaks to me louder than any words of support for Trump from the corrupt R governor.It’s a moral stain on me that I voted for the incumbent R senator and congressman, but if we get a 90 IQ hooker presidency then they should help produce some gridlock. In the state judicial races it’s hard to know who to choose on the merits, and there’s no party affiliation, but in each case it was a man vs a woman, so that made it easy.

        I’ve lived in a ‘third world’ country almost a decade.  Left Amerika because its justice system was co-opted by feminists and what we used to call political correctness.  Could no longer rely on defending myself and got tired of being a target.The presidential elections in my adopted country are far more valid than the thoroughly corrupt and evil U.S.  The corruption in this nation tends to be petty and monetary . . . fairly typical by world standards.  In the U.S., the corruption is a potent mix of Progressive totalitarianism and selfishness (moneygrubbing etc.)It’s harder to live here materially, but the big bright side is that the government does not care about me.  Has no interest in crushing me underfoot to ‘pay me back’ for being a misogynist, a sexist, a homophobe, and all the rest of the demonic agenda.  Masculinity and traditionalism are still valued here, whereas in Amerika these are anathema.

        Regardless of what happens, and I assume the cheating will be at least as bad as last time, it will be good to see Trump move into the rearview mirror, either soon or in 4 years from now.  People need to recognize America as they understood it doesn’t exist anymore, and we need to move beyond solutions that envision “saving the system” or imagining a white knight will ride in and save it for us.  We need to get to the “well, its broken and there is no fixing it, so what now” stage.

        The GAE was founded on too many lies. When the American Imperium was originally conceived with the Monroe Doctrine it was healthy. The fledgling country was trying to protect itself from domination by European and even Asian powers. It made claims about protecting its territory, defined them and then did what needed to be done to protect it.Post WW-II something changed. The American Right was crushed. With no dissent or opposition it told itself and its people lie after lie after lie after lie. The system is so lied to it can’t comprehend anything based on its lies. Right/Left. Conservative/Liberal. Those are the least of its problems.The emergence of Woke is really the formalization and unmasking of the real project. The GAE is not American. It wants to obliterate strong nation states by obliterating the nations that built the states. The GAE is anti-white. The 3rd World, or today the developing world, have names and governments and statehouses but they are not countries built by nations. They can’t be. They were always tribes that never combined to form greater nations. They were constructed in order to be absorbed into the empire.Now the only thing honest about the GAE is that it is demolishing the nations under its purview that it wants to destroy and dominate. This is the great crime of Donald Trump. Trump loves the American nation state. In the empire, there is only one nation state that is permitted. It isn’t America, which is being demolished before our eyes. We all know which nation state that is permitted. If that is the one that is permitted, then does that tell us where the seat of the empire is and which peoples dominate it on their behalf?Food for thought.

                Yes, the Russians “lucked out”.  Putin is in the finally analysis a true patriot of the Russian people and culture.  And I really don’t care if the guy has stolen billions of rubles in the process.  If you can vote for Trump, you need not complain about Putin.  The last perfect man was killed 2,000 years ago.I also note he is a race realist and favors Whites. I have recently read that by executive order he has opened Russia to relaxed immigration–from White countries only!  That includes the White West currently aligned against him.  Yep, even citizens from the good old USA, but not Africa, South American, Asia, etc.

                    Is Putin a race realist? His rhetoric is as inclusive as any Western politician; anti-fascism his mantra (understandably, for historical reasons). People from the former Soviet republics can obtain Russian residence under the assumption they were stranded behind post-Soviet borders. Some are ethnic Russians, others are not. They’re supposed to speak Russian but there are ways around that. The policy includes persons who are presumed loyal to the Russian idea, not whitesper se. Four Tajik migrants carried out the Crocus City Hall terror attack for Ukraine.Putin has now extended Russian hospitality to those fleeing the degeneracy of the West. Will Russia become a haven for dispossessed whites? Possibly. Volga Germans were welcomed there in the 18th century, though many remigrated over the following two centuries. Then there’s Jews. Not all fled the reputed horrors of the Pale of Settlement for the happy hunting grounds of the West. A goodly number stayed and have prospered in today’s Russia. So it’s hard to know whether Putin’s policies are white-positive or merely opportunistic. I guess time will tell.

                        Milord, our State Department spent $200 million on supporting the Sephardi Fidel’s Color Revolution between 1952-1959. It was the Left faction of the CIA that disrupted the Bay of Pigs operation, demanding that Kennedy call off the Marine and Naval forces that were to back up the Cuban dissident front line, leaving them to the slaughter.America continued being Cuba’s main supplier, even after the USSR cut off his credit due to nonpayment; our onerous conditions were only that he had to pay in cash.  He was running a national slave plantation, getting rich on exports and foreign aid.  Perhaps he was (and is) allowed to remain as a test bed.

                I believe that once or twice in every generation we get a catalyzing charismatic figure that arises out of nowhere, sometimes for good, sometimes for evil but is always a big game changer. Churchill, Hitler, Putin, Trump, JFK etc. Even Warren Buffett in his own way. What we need now is a daddy that will actually do the hard things necessary to correct the situation, while the children whine and snivel but are secretly glad.

            If we don’t assume a Pinochet means “our kind of guy,” we might recognize that this already happened.

Who during Biden’s term has been president?

We’ve increasingly taken to talking about emergent phenomena, schools of fish, etc., but command decisions—combat deployments, foreign and domestic—are in fact being made and obeyed.The military occupation of D.C. was televised.

A crime is not solved by saying nobody did it.

            Our deep state certainly could, and may even prefer to pivot to an Algeria type model.
That would involve about a dozen generals running things in conjunction with the intelligence agencies.
For society, most would get just enough crumbs from the table to subsist without too much grumbling.
The thing is that, in Algeria, the level of technological penetration is so low that they are limited to being paternalistically authoritarian.
Our deep state Karens want full totalitarianism, which means micromanaging every aspect of everyone’s life forever.

                We likely are getting full-on totalitarianism, and are in the soft version now. There’s a very solid chance even relatively anodyne sites such as this one get knocked off soon enough. It is breathtaking to watch unfold even if you already are cynical about things.

That is the correct identification of the true Deep State.  And that is what Karen wants.  She can’t really feel completely safe until she has all dissident threats chained and neutralized.  For their own good, to be sure.  It’s called ‘Homeland Security’ for a reason, for a purpose.
A pity that righties run from this truth.

        I will note that both Amazon and Facebook/Meta had their applications to buy nuclear power for AI shot down. Amazon by regulators and Meta by the EPA (endangered bees threatened by the new plant).Given that AI is supposed to be the next big money maker for Big Tech, and that it is also supposed to be the military industrial complex’s big advantage over Russia and China this can explain the swing from culturally aligned Democrats to Republicans among Big Tech. FWIW, the shampoo magnate Charles Haywood of the Worthy House is predicting a coup to stop Trump from taking office. His reasoning is that the Generals are running things already under Biden, and want to formalize their power as in Algeria. Note: Generals are not the MIC, just a part of it. With on their end, very little loyalty — they are not DeGaulle nor even Franco.I do think this lesson is obvious: Past performance is no prediction of future outcomes. We have so many revolutionary technologies, from drones to AI to social media, that methods and procedures that worked previously no longer work, at macro or micro levels, and the same is also true of failed methods that now work well in the new environment.

        There are quite a rew books out there that argue that we are passing from the Age of Mass Media, when the rulers had a monopoly on the Narrative, to the Age of Internet, where we get to look behind the curtain.
I am thinking ofThe Revolt of the Publicby Martin Gurri andThe Death of Expertiseby Tom Nichols.

            Portrait of an Artist was a good read as a young man, but yeah, Dubliners is his best work. Ulysses was self-indulgent and Finnegan’s Wake is whatever dwarfs self-indulgent.

                Finnegans has given hundreds of otherwise aimless literary scholars something to occupy them. For a century now a little city’s worth of middle class lives have been sustained entirely on the corpse of Ulysses. “Self-indulgent” art is a Job Creator!

            I like the way it’s bookended by youthful and mature epiphanies of disillusionment (Araby and The Dead).Portrait — well in my case the Non Serviam bit has certainly stuck with me. It’s all very well for the Smells and Bells Shirtlifting LARPer converts, but if you were born with a goodly infusion of Irish blood and grew up in that milieu then you’ll know what I mean.I’m not so down on Ulysses as some folk. Some brilliant passages — I particularly like the barmaid tarts and the interwoven events in that passage. Besides, Virginia Woolf really hated Ulysses, so that’s a plus for me.Finnegan’s wake just a gigantic joking fart self-huff, and Joyce dropped in that huge Ouroboros ending/opening sentence hint to tell us so.Way back when the Internet was new there was this Lisp programmer guy Jorn Barger who had a seminal blog called Robot Wisdom where he dissected passages in Finnegan’s Wake. Think he ended up homeless.

        I’ve been operating under the assumption that Trump is going to win, but I haven’t really been following this election very much. Monotone Trump slobbering all over Israel and toned down so the normies don’t get too rattled just doesn’t inspire me like insult comedian Trump did.However, this scene concerns me. This was the scene on the last day of early voting here in Cuyahoga County South. If you can picture a Target-sized building, this is where the Franklin County Board of Elections is located. (It was once the first Gold Circle store.)Pandemonium, lines wrapped around the building and I can guarantee you the majority are voting for Kumala.Here is the line snaking in back of the former Gold Circle store.?w=600&amp;h=523

        Cynicism is a waste of mental energy and solves nothing. Better is to withdraw into your own thoughts and focus your mental exertion on a remedy to what ails and afflicts us. The pathogens have invaded the host, but they are few in number relative to the public body. As an individual, you cannot put a dent in our macro-problems, but you can do something about a single pathogen, and that’s a start. Think outside the box. Wear the fog. Use the element of novelty and surprise. WTF just happened? That is how we win.

                If enlistment figures in the Services are an indication, the White boys have said “no thanks”.  A future major war with ground pounders and door kickers seems impossible–especially if the threat to “our shores” can not be made, and it can’t.

        If a corrupt place wishes to become less corrupt, it’s culture must change to include abstract notions like personal integrity. Culture is the key to it all. The Japanese are not corrupt because their culture includes the notion of personal honor. For example, they would never sell a car by industry to government that wasn’t top notch. By comparison, the U.S. military is legendary for its cost overruns and general financial abuse. The only way this will ever change is if men’s thinking changes.

                Corruption is endemic to humanity and can come in a gazillion different forms. A system built by Japanese for Japanese will have Japanese-style corruption, which the Japanese can handle and accept. The corruption that Americans have to live with these days is not really American, even as the definition of that changed (see, for example, the machine politics that emerged as vast swathes of poor immigrants flooded American cities in the late 1800s).

                I have read that crime in Japan is mostly non-violent, scams and that sort of thing. Even the Yakuza try to avoid violence, esp. against non-Yakuza, which would bring the cops down on them. The cops tolerate Yakuza activities as long as they don’t involve violence against outsiders. It is a similar system to the one the old big city cops here had with the Mafia. They would look the other way (helped with some grease from the mob) unless the Mafiosi used violence against the citizenry. Years ago my late mother was on a federal grand jury investigating organized crime ties with the local vice squad cops. There was plenty of corruption here in a city not noted for extensive Mafia activity, so it must have been over the top in places like NY and Chicago.

                    I missed the part where Z advocated voting for Con, Inc. He might have mentioned voting for Trump, not because anyone thinks Trump will do anything but he’s a one of a kind who has taken being literally shot at and keeps coming back. That’s worth something.
Regardless, even if someone here votes for Trump for reasons besides politics, they’ll have no need to ever vote for state or national office again.

                        For the last three years I was waiting to vote for Trump a third time, even if he was in an orange jump-suit – no, ESPECIALLY if he was in an orange jump-suit – just to give a finger to the Man.  Now, I find my self voting for him because he just might win, which means I can laugh while giving the man the bird.

There are myriad reasons to vote or not vote. Seems to me the candidate is the least of these given a corrupt process.  Fix the process or skip participation in it.

                    And when, not if, Israel ceases to be a country of significance, you’ll have to find someone else to feed you shit. Seriously, fuck off dude, with the nihilism I mean. You fucksticks never bring anything to the table other than carrying water for Jews (under the guise of “pointing out the Jew”), and what’s worse that while no one reasonably expects you to provide solutions to anything you dipshits actively go out of your way to deplete any inroads and discussions to solutions. Just. Fuck. Off. And. Disappear.

                    I can’t support Trump this election. It’s primarily because of his quite frankly bizarre and baffling Israel takes over the past few months. I can’t support a guy who goes out and literally says “Make Israel Great Again” and “Israel was the greatest country on earth” and “Israel is too small.” What those things imply is just too horrific for me to support. On top of that we are hearing that Kushner will be involved with hiring yet again. So, I get it. But, we do not know what Trump is going to do in office. He said flat out two days ago that he does not want war, and the regime media used that to claim he wants to execute Liz Cheney. It’s impossible to say.I get not supporting Trump but I also think that most of the people on our side who are pulling the lever for him are also doing so with clear eyes and don’t think he is our Augustus.

                        There are two faction competing for power, and they aren’t ‘Democrat’ and ‘Republican’. They are ‘genocide Jews’ (along with their numerous bought and paid for goy auxiliaries) and ’empire Jews’(along with THEIR numerous bought and paid for goy auxiliaries). The former have take control of the Democrats and the  latter still have control over the Republicans.The genocide Jews just want us dead. There will never be compromise or rapprochement of any kind with them. Pres. Trump has no choice but to try to peel off support from some of the empire Jews, who merely want us to be decorous and obedient slave cattle.So, it comes down to giving some of the Empire Jews something they want in exchange for something we want. Is it fair? No! But this isn’t our country any more. Understand this. It is their country now, for as long as they can hold it.I don’t like seeing this Israel crap any more than anyone else, but there isn’t any choice because this is a war for mere existence. The long term is made up of a lot of short terms, and I’m all in for the enticing prospect of 20 million deportations for the inevitable sociopolitical changes alone. Precondition the inevitable battlefield to come.

                            “So, it comes down to giving some of the Empire Jews something they want in exchange for something we want.”If only it were so, but it is not. We never get anything we want. Look at the first Trump admin. We didn’t get a wall. We didn’t get immigration restrictions. We didn’t get mass deportations. We didn’t get a big infrastructure law, and neo-classical architecture, and strong pro-America industrial policy. Yet… they got a massive tax cut, our embassy in Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and a cessation of the Iran nuclear deal. Trump brags about all this stuff, especially amongst his Jewish benefactors. Bottom line, they don’t see us as their equals or as participants of a system worthy as respect. They believe we exist to benefit them. So why would anyone think that you can work with these people and expect reciprocity? They’ll never say “hey you helped us out here, so let’s help you with this.” That’s not the way it works.In fact, if the “empire Jews” as you put it get their way, we won’t be getting 20 million deportations, we will in fact 2-3 million Palestinian refugees while Netanyahu annexes Gaza and the West Bank. Am I saying that, if Trump wins, that will happen? Absolutely, totally not. I have no idea. But this is how it is and voting for Trump right now isn’t going to change that and they aren’t going to remember the goyim’s support of him come policy time.

                                It was also the “Empire Germans” that flooded Europe with Syrian (and many other) ‘Refugees’.Israeli orgs are still at the forefront of shipping them into Greece, for example. If you deal with the Devil, you’ll get damnation, and deserve it.
