        Personally I feel heads should roll because of the hysterical rules imposed on us during Covid. Remember one-way aisles in grocery stores? Remember people getting arrested on hiking trails and deserted beaches? Canadian truckers? People thrown out of the military? The Australian government really went apeshit over this! I never did “take the jab” and caught Covid at the age of 72. It was no picnic, but I was my old self again in a week. The wave of shutdowns and crackdowns was outrageous, and I can’t understand Joe Sixpack’s “forgive and forget” attitude these days. Heads should roll!

            There is a lot of pent-up rage and anger over the Covid protocols. The surprising part is how that was delayed and only has come to the fore recently. The Australian business was and is horrifying. Australia polices language to an extent basically found nowhere else in the West, and even now criticizing online what happened during Covid can get you a police visit. The Canadian truckers are underappreciated heroes, in my opinion, and almost all were white in an industry that is becoming dominated by Subcons. Long-term, Covid is on par with mass migration in separating Western peoples from their governments.

                Sadly, I think you are wrong and that there is no pent up rage, or if there is rage, that anyone will act on that rage.
I never had much faith in the public, but until Covid, there was always some nagging doubt.  Covid removed that doubt.  There is nothing the public will not put up with.

                    True. Unfortunately, the attitude of most normies is “Well, yeah, it did get a bit OTT, but at the end of the day we all stood strong together and came through this horrible situation.”

                    Anecdotal, of course, but I’m seeinglotsof pent-up rage. Acting on it, of course, is a different matter. But to your point about the Covid acquiescence, that for me also burned the last bit of faith in the public.

                    This is all a function of leadership. There is plenty of rage. The issue is what effort would be involved in expressing that rage in meating out justice. I am guessing that none of us are going to do what it would take to express it. We would have to forfeit all we treasure and undertake a herculean effort likely doomed to fail or fall far far far short of justice.The reason it would fail is that there would be no representatives with real power willing to back this effort. We all know this, so we do the right thing and have our rage expressed in forums such as these.We have been abandoned and forsaken. We are stateless and we are leaderless in terms of having any leaders who hold and wield real power.That said, the rage is expressed in the form of the state having lost vast amounts of legitimacy and in being forced to abandon soft power in favor of hard power. This begets further loss of legitimacy.That is the sad reality of our situation. Now, the system is burning ladders and slamming doors shut in the face of young ambitious men. That is the pool of leaders from which the every man can effectively channel his rage. That is why your grandkids and kids watch TV shows where they internalize villany, oppressor and worshipper of the other. This is part of the plan to finish subjugation and ensure such leaders do not emerge or emerge without a sufficient power base. This is also why your towns are flooded with aliens. It is done to prevent the formation of redoubts and power bases.Just like Americans understood the meaning of the bayonets at the backs of those opposing the unleashing of savagery upon them so do we. Until real power that openly champions our cause emerges you need to build a power base at a very small scale. Your family. Your aligned friends and neighbors. Your aligned congregation or fraternal orders. That is, for now, the only place where rage can be constructively harnessed and channeled.

                        In China there are supposedly bollards popping up everywhere.  The alleged reason for this is what they call “revenge against society attacks” where cars will ram into crowds of people and even children or, less frequently, knife attacks.  I’m told, though I have no way of validating it that these attacks happen on a near daily basis.  There was a highly visible attack like this late last year with a large number of victims.Assuming all of this is true, I would think that only people filled with not only rage, but an inability to channel that rage into something productive would do it.  Though we do see a minor uptick in things like this in America, it is happening far less often.  With greater freedom and the enormous number of guns in America, one thinks that a large portion of the population being extremely angry (rage filled), we would see a large uptick, especially against politicians. But we really aren’t seeing this.  At best, we have disillusionment with our political class.While I wouldn’t expect it to be coordinated or on a mass scale, I would expect a higher number of people lashing out at an individual level.  In any society, there are large numbers of people who live on the edge.  That in good times, things go well for them and they behave, but in bad times, they are the first to fall off the edge. We are seeing it with drug abuse, but I think that is hopelessness, not anger at society or the “elite.”

                    When a couple 200 lb hockey players go at each other, the refs wait until they tire each other out (and let the crowd enjoy the spectacle a bit) before intervening.
Depending on where you lived, consequences for acting on rage could land you in big heap trouble.  The rage can be expressed when it is to your advantage (or at least to diminished detriment).  Let the DS battle itself until it tires out.  Putin and Xi seem to understand this.  Learn from Putin and Xi.

                        I was at a hockey game many years ago and there were a few fights.  But one of them was right in front of me.  I swear these guys held onto each other with both of them staring at the screen while not hitting each other.  Then, as soon as the camera was on them, they faced each other and the fighting started.  That’s when I realized it was just fake and gay like most other stuff on the tee vee!

                    I lived there a spell and continue to have many connections to Australia. It didn’t surprise me at all. One of the more surreal things I ever watched was a Sydney newscast about a prominent television presenter being tried for pointing out many of the Abo welfare recipients were in fact mostly white (which is true). The surreal part was how the anchors treated the prosecution of one of their own so matter-of-factly. The now-cliche rejoinder there when someone wonders why a land settled by prisoners is so complacent is that it also was settled by the guards and wardens.

                    “Crocodile Dundee,” was an amazing piece of myth making by Paul Hogan.
The character was actually based on his grandparents from late 19th century Australia.
The reality is that Australia has one of the most urbanized populations on the planet. Also, their British roots run far deeper than they will ever admit.

            So you want to “punish” the miscreants.  Hell, I’d just be happy if “Joe Sixpack” remembered the miscreants and their deeds such that it would affect his voting behavior longer than one election cycle.  It’s not so much “forgive and forget”.  It’s the “forget” part that is killing us.

            During the Covid panic I had some long arguments with relatives over me and my families’ refusal to take the experimental mRNA shot, resulting in us getting shut out of Thanksgiving and Christmas.  After many of the “vaxxed” relatives caught Covid multiple times, and we were unaffected, the topic was dropped, and they now seem embarrassed.  It’s as if the entire thing never happened.

                The worse part is that those who were so wrong, example my doctor, now completely ignore such, as in unwilling to admit error and move on.  And they chastise you if you bring up the subject.This is as you’ve noted, but I bring this up to add that those who got the “jab” now complain (unknowingly) of potential adverse reactions to the jab.  For example, I know of a nurse who got brain cancer shortly thereafter and passed.  Grandchildren now having problems conceiving.  Again, all known adverse reactions with published studies confirming these findings.I’ve done a lot of stupid stuff concerning my health in the past and now pay the price, but I can’t imagine how I’d profit from ignoring such history or failing to tell others to take heed of my (bad) example.

                                    I read something similar, also.It might have varied by country but vaxx hesitancy was positively correlated with class/education.
That said, when I started working in an absolute blue collar dump post-corona hysteria, the majority didnt like how it was all handled, but went along to get along.
So some might boil down to agency or autonomy in working arrangements.

                                In the fall of 2021 I was at a privately owned animal park-safari in rural PA.  The kind that the beautiful people would rarely visit.  On the doors of the gift shop were notices stating “Our governor requires masks to be worn inside – unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from wearing one.  If you do not have a mask on, we will assume you are unable to do so and no questions will be asked.”It was very easy to read between the lines and once inside the number of barefaced people outnumbered the masked, an extreme rarity at that time.  The dirt people were far more clued in than our betters in the hive.

                    “I’ve done a lot of stupid stuff concerning my health in the past and now pay the price, but I can’t imagine how I’d profit from ignoring such history or failing to tell others to take heed of my (bad) example.”Because their worldview is that of a victim.  It’s almost like a mental disorder.  I’ve seen one armed waitresses do an excellent job before, and i’ve seen people who lost an arm due to injecting themselves with drugs and it got infected, so off came the arm.  The second group wants to milk government benefits because they’re a victim.  You see the exact same in the majority of women who complain about men.  They didn’t pick a loser or an asshole, that person was forced on them!  We must destory the victim mindset, take away the money and it will cease.

                        I know a fat loser at a bar near me.  Loudly proclaims he’s a communist and asks if you read marxs and argues with everyone.  You should have seen the “communist” cry when the stock market when down in april.  They don’t know what they do or what they speak about.  Useful idiots.

                        Everybody — and I do mean everybody — now greatly benefits from the Victim Sweepstakes. . . except white men and boys, of course.
Team Victim would burn the country down rather than give up the free goodies and the jolt of sweet righteousness that comes from Shared Victim Status with others.
A cunning and satanic strategy.  Guaranteed to work, and it did.

                            But but but .  . . I’m “elderly” and on “disability.”  See this online daily.  Sorry not sorry.  If you cannot even admit you are OLD, how am I supposed to believe anything else you claim?  And disability is one of the biggest government scams going.  *No offense intended to those men legitimately disabled from manual/factory labor.  Those wahmen who claimed they were equal to any man and damaged their bodies trying to prove their lie – suck it up, buttercup.

                Ain’t it? The whole thing has disappeared down the rabbit hole. I would have thought that with the 5th anniversary of the start of the scam, there would be loads of events like those celebrating VE Day. Crickets! And now Big Pharma is pushing ahead with its latest range of mRNA products – cures for cancer. For them, Covid was just one big lab experiment to test out their top product.

                    Yes. That is why Bourla runs free. Thiel and Andreesen love mRNA vaccines. Per my previous post about power this is the ultimate reality. Does power stand to gain from fighting for bodily autonomy or from getting rid of it? Does it stand to gain from autonomous humans driving themselves around, or like Andreesen, from outlawing that and letting machines they profit from drive you around?

                Me declining the shot was a huge source of contention within my family. Praise God they haven’t been affected, but the topic never comes up because they’re sheepish about admitting I am right.

            I loved it when some rat faced jewish reporter later came out and penned a srawl about “It’s Time For A Covid Amnesty” where all us vaccine deniers were supposed to forgive and forget the calls for us to be sent to the camps and denied basic rights and freedoms.
“We were only going by the information we had available.” they whined. When the balloon goes up, the rule of law collapses and pitched race/civil/ideological war breaks out – keep your accountability list handy. I am going to personally go on a killing spree…!

                “…all us vaccine deniers were supposed to forgive and forget…”I’ve always found the above to be a two-way street—the offender must perform a number of items before the offended can be asked to “forgive and forget”.  Most often, this is never done.I’ve found the following as good guidelines for the process.  As I am tired of repeating from memory, so ChatGPT summary here:1.Acknowledge the WrongThe offender must recognize and admit the specific wrongdoing.This should not be general or vague but should clearly state what was done wrong.2. Express Genuine RemorseOne must feel sincere regret for the harm caused.This involves an emotional recognition that what was done was wrong.3. Cease the Wrongful BehaviorThe wrongdoer must stop committing the harmful act.If the behavior is ongoing, forgiveness is not appropriate yet.4. Make Amends or RestitutionWhere applicable, the offender must try to repair the damage done—this could be returning stolen goods, compensating for damages, or undoing slander.If the harm is not tangible, other forms of reparation may be necessary.5. Commit to ChangeThe person must make a sincere commitment not to repeat the offense.This future resolve shows the change is authentic.6. Personally Ask ForgivenessOnly after the above steps can the offender approach the person they hurt and ask for forgiveness.The request should be heartfelt and direct.According to tradition, one should ask sincerely up to three times. If the injured party refuses all three times, and the offender has truly repented, the obligation shifts away from the offender.When I see the above six points made in any call for forgiveness, you will have my attention.  Until then, I’ll assume you are just blowing hot air.

                    Its the same playbook with all of their “causes”.  Take the LGBTQ crap, respect is a two way street so watch while we desecrate all you hold sacred and then call you names when you ask them to stop.  If they respected you, they wouldn’t make their degeneracy their entire political platform.  I’ve said it before and i’ll say it again, psychology was not created to help people, it was created to better understand how to control people.

            I still remember walking into a coffee shop during COVID, with my mask on like a good little lemming. As soon as I walked in, the barista yelled at me, angrily, to get out and wait outside because they only allowed 2 people to wait in line inside and I was the 3rd. I had no idea I was the third. It was a cold day and I was not going to wait outside in the cold in this way. I just left and never went back.It wasn’t just the stupid rules, it was the way COVID encouraged people to dehumanize and disrespect each other in the most disgusting ways possible, ways that no person would ever treat other people, especially random strangers. I think this was the point of the rules, to tear apart the very fabric of society and destroy the basic decency that, in spite of the pressures the social engineers have placed upon us, most people still had.

                Reminds one of the Twilight Zone episode, “The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street.” In it, extraterrestrial beings cause strange electrical phenomena–power outages, dead batteries, lights turning on and off randomly, etc.–to generate fear and paranoia among Earthlings. The Earthlings abide, accusing and scapegoating one another, and the episode ends with deranged mayhem and gunfire. Once the masses destroyed one another, conquest of earth would be easy as pie.
The West’s power structure was the space invaders, the Covid lemmings were the Earthlings.

                I had one such experience at an *outdoor* nursery.  A little teen-age shit told me I need a mask to walk outside among the plants.  He began to lecture me about policy and County health rules and the like. I responded, “Are you asking me to leave?”, rather than argue with him over his foolishness.  He said, “No”., and I walked on.  I actually bought a plant inside the main building and lo and behold a second teen something was cashiering *without* a mask.  He just laughed when he saw me.  However, I never forgot, do not forgive, and never set foot in the establishment again.

            Remember one-way aisles in grocery stores?
Copenhagen has a string of lakes running 100 yards from the center, remnants of the old city moat, with broad pedestrian/bicycle lanes around them, each with a circumference of about half a mile. Very popular with joggers and dog-walkers and other health freaks. During Covid, those paths were made one-way traffic only.
We shall show them no mercy when the time comes.

            The main story of COVIDiocy was not the little Napoleons, nor the urgency with which those who chose “wealth” or the “tranquility of servitude” would like their laziness or cowardice forgotten. It is rather the vast numbers who so chose. We need not their counsel, nor their arms. Ideally they would simply be no longer of member of the body politic, as their track record should disqualify them from having opinions worth consideration.
Forgiven and forgotten, both them and their progeny.

            COVID did have at least one huge silver lining – it proved that many, if not most office jobs can be performed remotely just as adequately.  Saves a ton of overhead, commuting costs and aggravation, and gives more flexibility.  Commercial real estate probably not happy.

                I am convinced there were even more outrageous Covid plans–Australian concentration camps were a preview–and they were stopped cold for many reasons, including the revelations about what a fraud the American economy is. Also take note that when some governors started to get spicy–actually spicy–Covid lockdowns started to end.

                The only thing in my opinion remote working showed was how many bullshit jobs there were in this economy.  My general feeling is that this has been recognized as I see many companies rescinding such policies.  Much later than I’d have predicted, true, but inevitably.

            “everyone knows it”Hard to imagine “everyone” unless everyone means people in this commentary.  We’ve just lived through an overthrow of the democratic/governmental process that is comparable in effect to any in recorded history—and yet we still don’t have a parade of culprits being arrested nor an accounting of who and how, nor for that matter a prioritized investigation of the matter.  There can be no higher purpose of a new, and legitimate government than to get to the bottom of such corruption to correct the process for future generations.  Yet, “crickets”.How do we chastise the general public in this matter when the highest authority of the land treats this coup with indifference?

                My husband commented to me last night that, not to excuse the Jacobins, but he was now beginning to empathize withthe motivations of the Frenchrevolution.  Just killing them all and let God sort them out sounds increasingly amenable to him.  Of course, I’ve always been more bloodthirsty and have been advocating this for some time.

        One of the eerier things I remember from the COVID days was someone pointing out how if you entered a totally random number into a search engine, then the first result back was always a link to some article about COVID.  I tried it a bunch myself at the time.  You’d enter some random number – 3,473 say – and an article would immediately pop up about “3,473 total COVID cases this month somewhere” or “3,473 deaths from COVID in this region since the epidemic started” or some such.Statistically speaking, I realize that there aren’t that many small numbers so I can’t say with certainty that something like this wasn’t to be expected given the fact that COVID was in the news all the time.  It still came across as pretty bizarre though, so I wouldn’t be surprised if some kind of skullduggery was afoot – though for what exact purpose and by whom I can’t say.

            Campers never made economic sense to me, but that was back in the day where you could stay someplace decent for $60 a night.  A ‘camper’ elsewhere pointed out that when trying to stay anywhere remotely in demand (parks) the prices start at $200 and shoot up from there, making the math behind a mobile condo (almost) workable.

            I would hate to have to drive or tow a camper – and I routinely get stuck behind them driving our corkscrew curves during the summer months – but I’d prefer that to the bedbugs that have apparently been infesting even better hotels.  The Patels are at least equally repulsive as guests as they are hosts.  And it seems as difficult to get rid of as are the bedbugs they bring.

        While we’re on this subject, no less an authority than Ben S. Bernanke gave a speech last week calling for more transparency in the Federal Reserve’s official economic forecasting process.

            Think of the Fed “forecasting” as one does the Union of Concerned Scientists and their “Doomsday Clock” for a better understanding of their “forecasting”. Strictly a polling of a select group of individuals regarding their fears and uncertainty. Perhaps little better than the group you have beers with every Saturday at the local neighborhood bar.

            The stats that determine the reports get massaged partly because there is tremendous pressure to be timely. It’s like voting at the ballot box: you want those numbers to come in on time. The true sign of corruption comes when the stats cease to be adjusted to an earlier state…

                Is your inner monologue a constant analogy?
“6:30 am. Go downstairs to make breakfast. Like umpteenth graphs of the American hegemon, I’m trending downward.


Make some bacon and eggs. Like the proverbial chicken, our leaders’ decisions have come home to roost. But will we have to break some eggs to make an omelet?”

                The measure of corruption comes when the stat’s are corrected in one direction—and only one direction—month after month.  A correction is assumed to be because of “error”.  Error is a random event.  Error is therefore an event that cancels itself out in the long run.  Consider the proverbial “coin toss” example from Stat 101.  Error that repeats itself is “systematic”.  Systematic is assumed to have a specific cause and that cause is what we term “corruption”.(PS:  I answer “Greg-AI” only because it is really a response to the group.  Greg-AI is meaningless to respond to, but yet there are those who take “his” random muttering seriously…)

            That’s great. While Powell’s alleged determination to hold down inflation is laudatory (if that is in fact his intent), he has made noises about immigration (he wants more) and tariffs (he wants fewer). The Fed in theory is not supposed to be a political actor. Bernanke is covering his ass as well as disappearing into it.

        You see this with poorly structured sales bonuses for salesmen. A very wealthy friend once bought a company that had a loss leader product in its portfolio, BUT that product had major sales bonus incentives. “Sales are up!”, but we lost money. He, of course, to the salesmen’s dismay, restructured the entire sales incentive structure to emphasize the company’s high profit products. Loud part: “Job numbers are up!” Quiet part: “It’s all part-time, government, and foreigners.”

            Just look at the auto industry: Rebates and sales incentives are highest on what’s sitting on the lot the longest. The latest buzz is low, low, almost giveaway lease deals on EVs for any car company NOT named Tesla just to get the God d—ed things off of our lots!
Of course, as others point out, if the Government has to give a $7,500 tax credit to EV buyers to get them to lease an EV, that says volumes about the desirability of the vehicle in question

        No enemy foreign or domestic did more to damage Americans than “Biden,” even putting aside he was a mere puppet and figurehead. He richly deserves to die a painful, prolonged death. That may happen. If Dr. Jill starts saying unhelpful things, she, too, may dine at The Jack Ruby Cafe.As for the managerial state’s marketing department (that’s great…is it original?), there is a related and to my mind unprecedented development. The media is bleeding money and never again will be trusted, and seems to have turned on the managerial state regarding the lies it told about Biden. The marketing department, which hounded anyone who pointed out Biden was frail and had dementia, is claiming it was “misled.” The media, you see, was blameless and the liars and thieves who ran “Biden” deceived them. The marketing department claims it merely reported information it was provided by evildoers who seems credible. For some odd reason, Dr. Jill and Hunter have not been bothered for interviews.I actually don’t think this will work and people will continue to tune them out. We’ll see. The managerial state really needs a marketing department to survive, so maybe its GOP collaborators will help it censor the Net.

        The esteem to which the media still treats polling is hilarious at this point. We’ve had a good 20 years of the polls being proven to be basically totally fake yet they still treat them like ancient diviners putting animal bones over a fire. To wit, the media has been reporting on Trump’s collapsing poll numbers for months at the same time they acknowledge that those same polls show that all of Trump’s policies are popular. Obviously, this makes no sense. It’s impossible to disapprove of Trump’s job as President while at the same time liking everything Trump is doing. It makes no sense.

            Polls are not meant to take the public pulse. Polls are meant to shape public opinion. After all everyone wants to be on the winning side, so the idea is to sway those who don’t yet have a fixed opinion.
This is why polls usually show the results desired by whoever commissioned and paid for the poll.

            It makes no sense.
Yes it does.  If one knows a bit about polling—assuming the numbers are simply not made up from whole cloth—it’s easy to fudge the numbers.  Very easy.  You have various questions that you can ask to obtain negative or favorable responses.  Then you have sampling issues wrt to whom you ask.  It goes on and on.
Polls are like models, they tell you what you want to hear.  Folks need to ignore them—especially given who is usually the source of such polling, MSM.

            Legitimate polling costs a lot of money. If you’re getting polling data for free it’s a “push poll” designed to shape public opinion instead of sample public opinion. Every campaign does legitimate polling, but they sure as hell don’t share it with anyone.

            I’m dubious Biden’s is a turbo cancer. Would have expected him to get the saline. The medical folks lied through their teeth about his cognitive state, so it’s hardly a stretch that they lied about cancer too. But then the Satan Pope’s decline began immediately after his first jab, and I would have expected him to get the saline too.

That might have been the case with the Dems 30 years ago or so, but why would they spare Bidet? That, I think, is probably the Republican’ts biggest problem — they don’t have the slightest clue how truly evil their “friends across the aisle” are.

        The question is whether this is an emergent conspiracy, one directed from above, or more likely, some combination of the two. “But Trump!” existed as a rationalization for fudging the numbers long before Trump. Everybody on the “left” gets that concept and acts accordingly. It’s a manifestation of corruption so large that corruption begins to fail as a way to define it. It’s just the way things are now. All facts must be twisted or denied to better usher in the beautiful baizuo future. If that isn’t done, the deplorables might win!I recollect that the “right” also was very guilty of this behavior back during the early days of the WoT. Because otherwise the towelheads might have won! I should know how this works, since I participated. To my shame, but I have repented.

At the same time we were threatened with the winter of death and the vaccinated would die because other people weren’t vaccinated, the border was opened and flights and boats were filled with tens of millions of unvaccinated, filthy aliens who were shipped into and around the countryThe magic dust magically stopped being magical at 10 feetStanding on the magic feet where you were told to stand protected you from the magic dustWe could go on. I remember it was the 80s or so the idea of, “managing perception”, was introduced. It was introduced as the consumer economy was introduced because if people perceived that things were good they would be confident and spend money which in turn would make them wealthy. Psy-Ops and propaganda are, “managing perception.” Of course, bribery is merely, “campaign contributions.”Managerialism’s problem is not so much broken models and ingrained myopic mindsets. Managerialism’s problem is that it is a temple built out of lies.

            Why did they try to shut everything down?  The elites depend on their workers to produce.
Massive depopulation?
I think it’s just as likely that the elites are womanly and hysterical and panicked over exaggerations from their experts.
In other words, the elite panic was sincere and not a psy-op.

The sight of us offends them. Normal people out there wandering around, doing whatever—what could they be doing? must be terrible, since it’s a secret—inspires a rage so intense they’reending the worldto satisfy it.

            “It was introduced as the consumer economy was introduced because if people perceived that things were good they would be confident and spend money which in turn would make them wealthy. Psy-Ops and propaganda are, “managing perception.” Of course, bribery is merely, “campaign contributions.””

        ‘America is happy with the state of things, so they are going camping’The U.S. is more than just the upper-class citizenry who still can afford what is now a luxury: camping.I used to do a LOT of ‘camping’ during my homeless stints. :O)But I think your RV analysis correct about that class and above, who manage New Amerika.  Folk forget but when the Biden Steal went down, the U.S. was in decent shape, relatively.  Why?Because unlike the Righties, the Demoncrapic Left seeks PROACTIVELY to destroy the nation, and remake it in their own image, due to its irredeemable original sins of Misogyny and Racism and, well, whatever else the Ebil Ebil White Males do and are.  Kinda tough to have an economy when the government and deep state act to ruin it.When I was a kid in the mid-Miocene, we vacationed 2 weeks a year on one of the Yuba forks, whichever one grandpa said.  He knew them all, having grown up in Nevada City.  No chance of getting RVs back into those steep canyons.  No traffic.  No neighbors.  Oh yeah baby.We slept on army cots under the firmament.  Women and children too.  Now only turtles go camping, bringing their huge shells with them, which they duck into at least discomfort.  In affluence the people have become weak and impotent.

        I find the polling results and numbers fascinating because like the narratives they tell us what the rulers/blob want us to think.The COVID number were complete fiction and all they showed was what the science believers were required to parrot and told you what they were planning on doing next.When polling showed Kamala slightly ahead I knew Trump would win in a landslide.The most interesting numbers are when they tell a story that the rulers and their lackeys don’t want you to believe such as most people supporting what Trump is doing. For example, deporting illegals. If they send the wrong message you know that the real numbers are far worse for the regime and they are worried.

        I’ve always wondered about the RV business myself. I see these RV and camper places everywhere. I just don’t understand who buys these things and why you would buy them. It’s not like they’re cheap and how much use do people get out of these things to justify the cost?I always ask myself the same thing about motorcycles. I don’t see very many on the road. Do you just buy one of these things and park it in the garage like my brother did? Just take it out occasionally to have fun? I don’t get it.Or is this like a boat purchase where you buy it and ultimately regret it?One more little nuance: My understanding is that more and more of these RV parks are not allowing campers over 10 years old to use their facilities. Maybe somebody here knows why that is.

            It is a subculture. People buy these things so they can join a community of other people who buy these things. They spend every weekend at the park ground, enjoying life with their fellow campers. Clarence Thomas spends every summer in his RV, driving to his favorite campgrounds to hang out with his fellow campers.

                Exactly. I have an elderly relative who is part of the subculture. They are mobile Dead Heads. A surprising number do what amounts to volunteer work to help maintain the for-profit RV parks among other odd aspects.

                Sounds dreadful.  But I am an introvert and if I’m honest with myself I overall find all travel to be a huge waste of time, money, and energy.  It is the rare vacation I have enjoyed.

                Tons and tons of touristcampers on the windy two-lane roads here.  Plenty of locals less well off economically buy a camper (new or used) and park it on family land, or an out of the way acre.  Same with motorcycles here – tons of ‘tourists’ come ride the famed roads in groups of up to a dozen , and they often rent out huge blocks of hotelrooms.  Localsride too – but one thing the tourists and local riders have in common is that they are generally old and fat.  We’re not talking the “Wild Ones” here.  It’s a huge subculture.

                    I toyed with the idea of “van life” for a little bit. Not permanently, but as a cheap way to see the country so I don’t have to pay for hotels all the time. The boss wouldn’t be into it, but she could meet me somewhere along the way.I guess rodent infestations are common if you’re regularly just camping out in the middle of nowhere, especially if you do a lot of eating in your vehicle. If I ever do this, I will have to rodent proof everything because I don’t think I can handle restaurant food on an ongoing basis.

            Ten-year-rules have been implemented by relatively few parks. Their purpose may be as varied as (a) keeping the riff-raff away from your $200,000+ Class A neighborhood, (b) preventing oil leaks from mucking up their nice clean pad sites, or (c) avoiding the inconvenience of having to remove immobilized vehicles. As for utility, you would be correct in assuming that most RVs spend the vast majority of their lifetimes parked in owners’ yards—which is why they are a good indicator of discretionary spending power. Nevertheless, ten-year-rules are more likely to be applied to a different sort of RVer, known as a full-timer, who lives in an RV in lieu of having a sticks and bricks abode.

                Yup. Agreed.And it is good for the soul if you do it right. I bought a little A frame camper to park at my rod and gun club. Every summer I walk to the range from my campsite and just shoot and BS the day away. It gets me out of the house, gives the wife a break and some time to herself, and a lot of the times she comes with me.Some people paint, some make music – everyone has a thing and for me summer camping is my thing. If I didn’t have a trailer I’d go out with the tarp and a tent. It rejuvinates the soul and blows the dust out of the brain box and keeps me young.

                    Can’t speak for other places, but my favorite yearly bowhunting destination is the Apalachicola National Forest in North Florida. During fall archery and spring turkey seasons, you’re allowed to camp anywhere you please, not just in one of the designated campgrounds. I love this because I really don’t want to listen to a neighbor’s RV generator all night, and I prefer to camp within walking distance of where I’m going to hunt.

                    The Feds used to have what’s called Dispersed Sites, meaning if you go back far enough into the mountains, it’s free.  Sometimes these are places that RVs can’t get to.
You’re only supposed to stay two weeks at Dispersed Sites but nobody ever tried to push me outta a campsite.  You get far enough back, there are few or no rangers.  I stayed entire summers in the same site more than once.

                    Make sure you hone your instincts to watch out for the fucking deer, too. I ride in a rural area on mostly two-lanes, so I’m usually not worried too much about the cagers as much as the animals. They are EVERYWHERE around here. One jumped into my shoulder two years ago, not fun but I’m sure as hell still riding.

                    A few days back my tico buddy and I were nogginwandering about motorcycles, and I suggested we buy a big ole nasty harley hog, fully dressed. . . with a sidecar for me.  Oh yes baby.  Goggles, nazi helmet, all of it.Of course we don’t have the dollahs, and also I banned him from riding outside town because the last moto-smashup almost killed him, and he’s got a 3 y.o. boy.In this place, you might even get away with a sidecar, stick to the smaller towns.Your husband and I must be on the same wavelength. Not a comforting thought to the nation’s enemies.

            I always ask myself the same thing about motorcycles. I don’t see very many on the road. Do you just buy one of these things and park it in the garage like my brother did? Just take it out occasionally to have fun? I don’t get it.The first question I have to ask is where do you live TN? I’ve lived in the Midwest all of my life andIFwe are lucky we’ll get oh, 6,maybe7 months of the year where a motorcyclist can use his (or in the VERY rare occasions, her) bike without freezing their buttocks off, sliding and crashing on ice and snow, or being pelted with rain. As soon as the weather gets halfway decent (50 Degrees F and no rain or ice cold wind) the motorcycles come out in force around my part of town.Bike as a regular form of transportation around here? NopeBike as a fun means of transportation (and cheaper than a convertible)? YupBikes and convertibles are sold on an image of riding off into the sunset (or on winding mountain or beachfront roads) and rolling around in or on something “out of the ordinary”. That appeals to folks. Not EVERYTHING in life has to be dull and practical.That said, you’d better have a dull, practical car with a steel roof for the months of the year it’s cold, rainy, and snowy out. 😉 And a place to stow that bike or drop-top when you can’t drive it (Add Sta-Bil to the gas tank folks. Also take the battery out. 👍)Or is this like a boat purchase where you buy it and ultimately regret it?Depends by person. My eldest Boomer brother has owned some manner of boat since his 20s. Still has one and even if it doesn’t move all that far from the dock these days, he’s still chilling aboard it during the spring and summertime.Meanwhile my Gen-X cousin (from the wife’s side of the family) used to live up near the Chain O’Lakes in Illinois near the IL-WI border. Had a house right off a channel, a deck boat, and a boat lift. When he was younger the boat was out damned near every day. Now granted, in “The Chain” you find out very quickly boats are water taxis to move from bar to bar that are “helpfully” located near the water. He and his first wife were part of the party atmosphere up there. He remarried and moved to Florida, where you’d think with an ocean and a gulf he’d be in boating heaven. Nope, sold the boat and made friends with others who have one.So as Z says, he was part of the “subculture” of the lakes, and once he moved out didn’t see the need to pay for a boat, trailer, and slip.

            It’s the same thing with horses-I always see them in someone’s back yard or field, but never any of them actually being ridden. It’s a status symbol. Unfortunately, keeping a horse isolated in a boarding facility without any interactions will cause the poor horsey to go mental and develop “stimming” habits like continuously banging their head against the stable wall, or obsessively walking in circles.

                Horse owners around me have them out all the time (Amish). 😉Some englishers down the road I guess rode their horses down to the dollar store which I’m surprised I don’t see more often since they have a hitching post for the Amish shoppers.**(I should note that I get calls from Amish for a lift down the road because for horse power it’s either too close to be worth the trouble of hooking up the horse, or too it’s far away for the horse to get to).

            With real houses being priced out of reach for most people, RVs are filling the gap. “The working homeless” is a real thing in California. They don’t usually park along the street anymore; that got cracked down on. Instead, homeowners make off-books money allowing tenant RVs to park &amp; hook up in the side yard.
When that’s how you live during the week, it’s the easiest thing to pull up stakes for a weekend vacation.

            it’s because you can get a 15 to 20 year loan for something with a kitchen and a bathroom (ever wonder why so many small 20 foot boats have a tiny kitchen and a little portable bathroom?) .   That makes the monthly payments “affordable” and people never think about how much they cost to run/move/maintain/etcI think either they are really into the lifestyle, or they are toys that sit a lot.   Campgrounds aren’t free either, costs money to stay.Motorcycle sales are WAY down from even 20 years ago.   Everyone too busy on their phone and not paying attention.  Harley goes under when the boomers die off, but even the Japanese are struggling.   they used to be cheap transportation, now they are ridiculously expensive.  (look up prices, you’ll be shocked)

            When one really thinks through the RV/Camper thing, it makes no sense.   For the cost of the thing, one can spend many nights in high-end hotels around the country, with comfy beds, nice bathrooms and clean sheets.  And no worries about the vehicle, campgrounds and everything that goes along with ownership.

            The local RV dealership businesses are closing, going bankrupt. California is effectively outlawing RVs (must be “green” electric only which do not exist and cannot exist). I see a lot of RVs in my suburban neighborhood, 10 down two streets alone. They are used for: extra housing for visiting relatives/friends from Thanksgiving through Jan 1 (at that time they get moved to the curb and extension cords are run to them), beach and desert camping, thats about it.California is also outlawing ICE vehicles by 2035, so there is that as well. No more sales or transfers. Vehicles from other states that are ICE cannot enter.In the LA / Orange County metro area, motorcycles are often used for commuting. They can use the HOV / Carpool lane, like electric vehicles (which is why California has the most sales of both motorcycles and electric vehicles of any state). This is particularly true since lane splitting here is legal. You don’t see many new Harleys, which can cost up to 40K. You see a lot of Hondas, Yamahas, Kawasakis in the 6-8K range, along now with the Indian manufactured Royal Enfields which are also relatively affordable.For example, commuting from say mid Orange County to Beverly Hills is at least two hours in the morning and about three in the evening by car. It is about an hour each way on a motorcycle just because lane splitting is legal, and so is use of the HOV lanes.

            Admitting that Biden’s been braindead for decades is field prep forthatstory.It started years ago, apparently as an actual grassroots thing. “Obviously Biden is senile, but Trump is doubly so.” Internet libs who care more about disenfranchising the chuds than about defending specific Democrats have been saying it for years. Leadership is catching up. (The currrent major political realignment isn’t the Republicans going “MAGA” (they aren’t) but Democrats becoming as evil as their voters.)“Conservative intellectuals” (Republican nerds) enjoy the fantasy of retard Trump, too. Even our beloved Derb indulges in it, nerdily, by pretending not to understand English when Trump speaks it.Trump’s 25th Amendment arc, perhaps ending with his forced institutionalization, is scheduled for after the midterms.

        Most of the “data” discussed in the media is pure propaganda designed to manage public expectations.  I forget if it was 2022 or 2023 when the GDP contracted 2 quarters in a row, but suddenly, after decades of defining a recession as 2 quarters in a row of “negative growth,” the definition was changed to deny the (brief) recession.  Frankly, you know things are bad when their BS measurements can’t massage the recession away.There has been a steady erosion of the integrity of public information for the last 60 plus years.  Each administration has steadily chipped away at the methodologies used to track the health of the US economy.  From Kennedy’s massaging of the unemployment rate, to Clinton’s Boskin commission to the redefinition of a recession under Biden, economic data has become a tool to manipulate the public.

        A quick reminder that we were told that the economy would dive into another Great Depression and that we’d be at nuclear war with North Korea…after Trump won in 2016.
So the latest caterwauling has been largely met with yawns by the public.  Egg prices are down, for example.
The single biggest threat to the administrative state is collective public awareness that most of the administrative state is completely unnecessary.

        Just one little beef with what you wrote above: I remember reading that the obituary pages in the Boston area were far more numerous during COVID than they normally were.I don’t think it hurts the cause to admit that COVID was real. My theory is that the virus was good at attacking the weak parts of your system. My mom’s cancer came back causing her expiration, my cousin’s husband had a near cerebral hemorrhage, my blood sugar spiked up, etc. in addition to all the respiratory stuff people had.Just my theory, but I think this was the real damage from COVID.

            Back when they were reporting numbers like they were Bob McNamara, NYT wrote a story signifying, I think, 100,000 COVID deaths and listed a bunch of names. The sixth name on the list was someone who died in a car accident but tested positive for the coof afterwards. The government shut down the hospitals for elective and non-emergency services, thus depriving them of needed revenue, while also giving them a bonus for every COVID case they treated. It doesn’t take a PhD in mathematics to figure out what is going to happen when you put those two together.I don’t think it is really useful to debate whether or not COVID was “real”, but that’s not the point of Z’s editorial. The question is how the managers treated it, and here, the government absolutely, 100%, unequivocally did everything it could to juice the numbers.

                No doubt they were trying to juice the numbers, but things really were happening out in the real world that hadn’t happened in the past. My lying eyes were telling me something was indeed going on during that period of time.

                    Still didn’t justify the response.  If it was deadly to anyone other then those who cost the government money via SS or medicare/medicad, we would have seen piles of bodies being burnt in CHOP and the riots that happened all summer.  Yes something was going around, and i’m rather certain it was .gov spreading it.  A nasty flu was going around Jan/Feb of 2020, but it wasn’t covid.  I caught it, knocked me flat for three days and then gone, like Lazarus arisen from the grave i felt afterwards.  No covid symptoms though.

                        That’s not what we’re talking about here, I believe reading at some point that there were four times the number of obituaries in the Boston paper then in the previous year.
You have to be pretty closed-minded, like the people down voting me, if this doesn’t raise eyebrows.

                            Maybe, or desperation because after 4 years nobody really gave a shit about Russia Russia Russia but the crazies.  Honestly, i’m not certain why they hung their hats on Russia in 2016.  Nobody really had a reason to hate them in the general public, and the only people that hated them were the forever government who feels nobody is fit to rule but themselves.  Had Ukraine happened earlier (i’m aware of what has been going on in Ukraine since 2014, but most people were not) it would have had more traction.  I simply think they need to print money because 2008 was never corrected.  The losses from the over valued stock market were put on savers (a decade of 0% rates) and it was reflated along with the housing market (funds alot of muni’s, can’t have them pair down).Here is why you can’t write off all “communists” some of them aren’t totally stupid and use their lens of the world to inform for the good of all and not just their grift:https://thephilosophicalsalon.com/a-self-fulfilling-prophecy-systemic-collapse-and-pandemic-simulation/

                    “Something was going on.” Wow, way to take a stand with specifics. Where would we be without this useful commentary? Sounds like a boomer postingBTW, the “something going on,” was our government telling people they couldn’t go to work, or anywhere else, except to big box stores where the cough was only contagious in certain isles, and scared people away from hospitals (I worked in a hospital throughout and post covid – they amount of critical cases caused by delayed treatment is insane, and everyone involved, including boomers vague posting well after the fact, should be strung up) mandating experimental gene therapys to “keep your job” (but not your health),bur BLM protests and gay chemsex parties were non-contagious events, all over a bad flu season.Fuck you.

                        I’m betting they told half the floor staff to go home, after forcing out the people who refused the shot; then the beancounters and admin started wreaking havoc with with scheduling, after they had already ruined patients’ treatment schedules. You guys were either being run ragged or at times certain wards were empty or closed off when they were needed.I’ll also bet that any admissions surges were from the delayed treatments, plus shortages in ordering, crappy PPE, chronic mask rash, and a thousand other hassles- as well as being forced to watch the inhuman treatment of your patients and coworkers.Hats off to you, Reaver. You must have a thousand horror stories.

                    The only thing(s) going on were deaths of the very old and co-morbid from a novel disease—such always happens until the disease shortly mutates to a lessor virulent form, and the government “bounty” directly paid to the hospitals for treatment of Covid patients.Hospitals “diagnosed” everyone with Covid for $$$.  Disease mortality “models” never took into account (changed their predictions) the predicted mutation of the disease and the lessening of mortality.  Hospitals had no concept of best treatment regime for Covid and killed most of their patients through inept use of respirators before they stopped this “treatment”.The Covid that initially swept China, Italy, and NYC was not the same Covid 8 months later (when I first got it).  Even in NYC, the disease was not nearly as dramatic as predicted.  The US Navy hospital ship sent was little used. The Jacob Javits center, converted to a makeshift hospital, was never used.One best looks back at the initial Covid response by forgetting *everything* they read/heard in the MSM at that time.  Such is why you are confused.

                        Right, and that’s what I’m saying. It is my observation that COVID sped up the process so I don’t think you can say the COVID had no effect. My mom came from a bloodline of people who lived a long time. She was in remission and otherwise healthy. I think she’d still be around if it wasn’t for the COVID bringing her cancer back and speeding up her demise.She was 83 so not a spring chicken, but her mom and dad lived longer than that by far. She was otherwise healthy enough that she shouldn’t have been too far off from her parents longevity.

                            Did she have the mRNA vexinne?  If so, the vexinne itself and the boosters are linked to the increase in all cause death rates and the reports of turbo cancers.However, more scary is that is that there is reasoned argument that perhaps the spike of the Covid protein itself has such an effect—whether or not—directly introduced through disease or vexinne.The human immune system is still a great mystery.  As far as cancer is concerned it’s pretty much accepted that we *all* get cancer unknowingly because the well working immune system catches and eliminates those cells that turn cancerous, quickly and efficiently!  In the old, the immune system weakens and the cancer wins (see: Joe Biden).Anyone here have an “old dog” that did not die of cancer?  I never had.

                    Covid was real. But we knew within a few weeks that it was mostly affecting the same age ranges of people who normally died from flu: 75+ and with a stack of co-morbidities.

                Fauci himself said that the shutdown of hospital facilities in response to (predicted) Covid increased needs (never happened) would cause excess deaths due to delayed treatment for illnesses (non-Covid) and delays in preventative testing.  He estimated that delayed breast cancer screening could result in 10k deaths among women in the coming years.And if you think that was unusually honest for a duplicitous slimeball like Fauci, you must remember he said this during the height of the scare where he expected/predicted Covid cases would swamp the hospital system shortly.  In light of that thinking, 10k excess breast cancer deaths were nothing compared to Covid deaths.

                I struggled mightily to get a copy of my good friend’s death certificate (02/2021, while hospitalized). New York State was “fussy” about letting me see it, but I just had to. He had a morbid sense of humor, and would understand.My friend died from multiple organ failure brought on y years of aggressive self-medicating undiagnosed mental illness.But what did his death certificate indicate…?

                    Of course…. Another aspect of our “medical system”—control of which is each State’s responsibility—is that death certificates vary as to information contained.  Their are contributory causes and direct/immediate causes, but these are often confused or simply not clearly stated.  Hence it’s difficult to tease out just what contribution to death a Covid infection caused.

            My only experience with knowable excess deaths was when the township I live in had sharp increase in deaths…after the vax was put out.I also note though that sharp increase was followed by a long drought, suggesting that, at least in my limited anecdote, the vax pulled forward deaths.

            Covid was real.  I’m unvaxxed and got it and it was basically a stubborn cold.  But after it was gone, I got this crazy itchy rash i never had b4 that took a while to go away.  I tend to think that having covid puts your immune system into overdrive which can have variable results

                Same here, but I also had a total of six funerals to go to in 2022. My mom, her first cousin, her uncle, the other half’s mom, dad and grandmother. That’s a lot in one year. Coincidence? Maybe, but I wasn’t the only one with that experience.

                        Two of them were natural. The uncle was in his 90s and the grandmother was 100 years old and in a nursing home. She also wanted to go so maybe I shouldn’t have mentioned them.The rest of them late ’70s early ’80s and they all had some kind of pre-existing condition which also goes back to my theory about covid attacking the weak parts of your system. They already had “chïnks” in their armor and COVID sped up their demise. My theory, anyway, and I think it dovetails with the conspiracy theories about certain elements trying to substantially reduce the world population.My sugar shot way up in 2022. I was well into diabetesland. I’ve been fine since that period passed. I have the scarlet letter of being a diabetic now, even though my labs all have been fine since then.

                Overdrive is not the issue, complacency/supression of the immune system is. The Covid vexinne, and especially the repeated boosters, cause a rise in IGG4 antibodies. IGG3 antibodies fight the current disease. IGG4 antibodies tell the immune system, “Nothing to worry about here, we’ve seen this before and nothing bad happened…”In short, these antibodies are typical in recurring insults like Spring pollen and the like. They quite down the immune response, which to those insults are worse than the disease. WRT to Covid spike proteins, this is bad news—and it seems likely to suppress the immune system in general, hence “turbo” cancer in people who have been cancer free for years.As I’ve said many times before. The All Cause Death rates are the key to understanding the folly of the mRNA “treatment”.  You screw with Mother Nature at your peril.

                        I forget the argument specifics, but I think I was arguing toward/against the layman definition of murder as an *intentional* act with forethought in the case of Covid.  If one doesn’t know the far reaching effects of the vexinne and you really have no intention of a Gates-like population control effort, then you have negligent homicide, rather than intentional murder.I will acknowledge that in most State penal codes the term “homicide” is used for most all acts of human caused human death, but with varying definitions of intention.  Murder being the layman term for the most heinous and unforgivable act of homicide.I believe I assumed at the time you were using such a definition of homicide as I described above.  I don’t agree here.  But the Covid fiasco/response certainly was borderline, or just plain negligent in all manner of ways and many folk died from such who might have lived.If I was abrupt or curt in my response to your comment, please accept my apologies.  Your comment *was* well taken in its spirit I can assure you.

                            But you could never have gotten to the point of the jab without the fear to drive people to it.  I think that fear was already beginning to die beginning of summer 2020.  That is why St. Floydd was created.  A loser made into a saint in the minds of the mentally unwell.  Then they sanctioned their brownshirts to harass people all summer.  So they didn’t treat those properly before saint floyd and i doubt they started after.  The point was to get to the jab, the reason is still speculation.
