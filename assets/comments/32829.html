        Real skills – how to fix or make something, for example – will always be the mark of intelligence. The Internet will die with our technological civilization but smart people will find a way to get by.

            I’m sure there is a lot of this sorting going on in rural NC over the last week or so. I’m sure the metadata bug men working their remote FAANGMAN jobs thought to download Wikipedia to a local drive instead of assuming the internet would be on.

            Yes! It’s the “level 2 and beyond” ability that counts, Of course, the irony here is that you can go to the Caribbean and see broken equipment everywhere despite the existence of repair videos on Youtube. Most of the world is watching midget porn on the web and cannot even get to level 1.

            I’m not sure about that.
i am a girl and still have a LOT to learn about fixing things (not a natural ability in most women, we know).
However, it’s a pretty short list of things I could fix (with my hands) or make. (Other than a tasty meal in the kitchen.)
So I’m not sure your position entirely holds true.

                Keeping the good hot meals coming is a first-rate, irreplaceable skill when things are falling apart.
And in my observation, most good cooks are smart people, who have an intuitive grasp of the chemistry and physics that makes the bread rise and the soup not boil over.

            I’m sympathetic to your point, but can’t agree with it entirely. Hence, it is a commonplace of genius that figures such as Einstein and Newton have virtually no practical knowhow, or intelligence, if you prefer. And yet very few people would claim that your basic mechanic, plumber or carpenter is in the same class intellectually as people like Einstein and Newton.It almost seems as though extremely high intelligence somehow forecloses the ability to perform all but the most rudimentary of practical functions. But ironically, the basic skills of the tradesmen are arguably more important than the refined speculations and analyses of the vast majority of physicists and philosophers.

                By Isaac AsimovWhat is intelligence, anyway?When I was in the army, I received the kind of aptitude test that all soldiers took and, against a normal of 100, scored 160. No one at the base had ever seen a figure like that, and for two hours they made a big fuss over me.(It didn’t mean anything. The next day I was still a buck private with KP – kitchen police – as my highest duty.)All my life I’ve been registering scores like that, so that I have the complacent feeling that I’m highly intelligent, and I expect other people to think so too.Actually, though, don’t such scores simply mean that I am very good at answering the type of academic questions that are considered worthy of answers by people who make up the intelligence tests – people with intellectual bents similar to mine?For instance, I had an auto-repair man once, who, on these intelligence tests, could not possibly have scored more than 80, by my estimate. I always took it for granted that I was far more intelligent than he was.Yet, when anything went wrong with my car I hastened to him with it, watched him anxiously as he explored its vitals, and listened to his pronouncements as though they were divine oracles – and he always fixed my car.Well, then, suppose my auto-repair man devised questions for an intelligence test.Or suppose a carpenter did, or a farmer, or, indeed, almost anyone but an academician. By every one of those tests, I’d prove myself a moron, and I’d be a moron, too.In a world where I could not use my academic training and my verbal talents but had to do something intricate or hard, working with my hands, I would do poorly.My intelligence, then, is not absolute but is a function of the society I live in and of the fact that a small subsection of that society has managed to foist itself on the rest as an arbiter of such matters.Consider my auto-repair man, again.He had a habit of telling me jokes whenever he saw me.One time he raised his head from under the automobile hood to say: “Doc, a deaf-and-mute guy went into a hardware store to ask for some nails. He put two fingers together on the counter and made hammering motions with the other hand.“The clerk brought him a hammer. He shook his head and pointed to the two fingers he was hammering. The clerk brought him nails. He picked out the sizes he wanted, and left. Well, doc, the next guy who came in was a blind man. He wanted scissors. How do you suppose he asked for them?”Indulgently, I lifted by right hand and made scissoring motions with my first two fingers.Whereupon my auto-repair man laughed raucously and said, “Why, you dumb jerk, He used his voice and asked for them.”Then he said smugly, “I’ve been trying that on all my customers today.” “Did you catch many?” I asked. “Quite a few,” he said, “but I knew for sure I’d catch you.”“Why is that?” I asked. “Because you’re so goddamned educated, doc, I knew you couldn’t be very smart.”And I have an uneasy feeling he had something there.

                    Your mechanic’s IQ test reminds me of the old English brain teaser “As I Was Going to St. Ives” (which I was not clever enough to figure out.)I can identify with your military story. I did fairly well on ASVAB but don’t recall the scores. On the SAT I was in the high 1200s, “mildly gifted.” What I lacked then, as now, was ambition, focus, drive, call it what you like. Yes, I really was and still remain a Layabout. I’ve tried my hand at fixit type stuff and — at best — I’m average, perhaps. Whatever the reason, smart does not equate to mechanically skilled, or indeed, even competent in other practical skills.Nobody knows it all (except in movies). At one job site, I was a “geek” but one with somewhat dated Unix admin skills, not a good fit for the project I was assigned to. Yet skilled programmers, many of them Chinese, who probably had forgotten more about C++ or SQL than I would ever know, apparently didn’t know basic OS operations (e.g. how to set file permissions) and would sometimes ask me.On the other hand, I quickly determined that working twelve or sixteen hours a day was not to my taste and when the opportunity to retire in my 40s presented, I jumped.

                Being intelligent doesn’t preclude you from practicality, I think it just stems from an appreciation for different systems or phenomena. Genius or average guys can appreciate cars or aeroplanes for different reasons. Though I’ll grant there is also an aspect of the aloof/absent minded professor about extremely intelligent people.The two hyper-genius guys I knew (of) back in maths weren’t very functional in a normal human way, but one of them was socially capable. He just didn’t bother or see much point to it.I basically refuse to believe that this fellow isn’t at least reasonably intelligent:https://www.youtube.com/user/matthiaswandelHe also had some proto-based musings about society:https://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/rants/civic_pride.htmlI was also recently reading a book about the settling of my hometown/region and one of the earlier guys was a flunked minister or lawyer or something. After emigrating from Europe his intelligence or education was then refocused into his farming and he became somewhat of an experimentalist and pioneer in techniques that the other farmers then copied. He didn’t become a leader in production however because he liked experimenting and documenting his findings so much, where as some others settled for good enough.

                    Sometimes a person of supreme intellect reallyis“screwed up”, or at least, very eccentric. Exhibit A, from Rolf Dobelli’sThe Art of the Good Life.“Grigori Perelman, born in 1966, is considered the greatest living mathematician. In 2002 he solved one of the seven mathematical “Millennium Problems.” The remaining six are still unsolved. He was selected for the Fields Medal, a kind of Nobel Prize for mathematics—and declined. He even turned down the million-dollar prize money, although he could certainly use it: Perelman is unemployed, living with his mother in a high-rise block in St. Petersburg. Mathematics is all that matters to him. He’s utterly indifferent to what the world thinks of him and his achievements.”Some readers may recall that Derbyshire is a mathematician. Here’s his wiseass commentary, while talking about the rarity of super-smart IQ at the tails of the bell curve:“There are, for example, no blackFields Medalwinners. While this is civilizationally consequential, it will not likely ever be important to you personally. Most people live and die without ever meeting (or wishing to meet) a Fields Medal winner.”

                        There is no doubt in my mind that intelligence breeds eccentricity. The reasons for that, however, are obscure. But, as your example of Perelman indicates, it could stem from an utter disregard for the mores and customs of the common man. Beethoven is a classic example. He couldn’t possible be bothered with the niceties and social emoliuments of his society, and in consequence, behaved like bizarre horse’s ass.

            There may be bumps ahead but it’s almost impossible for our whole technological civilization to die out. The internet is here to stay.  Even sizable wars in Ukraine haven’t knocked their grid out. Sure, the Russians have pulled their punches but nonetheless they’ve dropped some serious bombs on their infrastructure. Things are more robust than preppers like to think.  The only way it all goes down is if white people disappear.

        Memorizing a lot of facts changes your brain and helps it form connections and process data, and it keeps it healthy. So does learning a new language. So, my first thought is that intelligent people will still keep doing these things. It’s an intellectual challenge to, say, learn how to read Chinese or whatever. Intelligent people can process data and form different opinions while people who rely on the computer in their pockets will just be able to regurgitate information. We see this today – you can go on Twitter and find real people who clearly can do little more than regurgitate establishment talking points. Actually, I am not sure they are real people because they are indistinguishable from bots programmed to regurgitate establishment talking points. Of course this is by design.Maybe at some point we will decide universal education is a waste of time, dumb people can just use their smartphone to mold their brains and tell them what to do, it’s much more efficient than paying for thirteen years of school for them. Do we really need to pay $30,000 per student per year in Baltimore so ChatGPT can do their work for them without learning to read? We all know that’s happening and nobody can do anything about it. Likewise, people who want to get educated and go and get educated, it’s not like school is good for that anymore. We saw that in COVID, where smart kids were getting their coursework done in 2 hours as opposed to the 7 a day they are spending in school. All the educational tools are out there for them to learn.

            Vital pointre brain connections and changes.  When I see toddlers swiping screens I want to shoot their parents.  Take the average (not particularly bright) individual and raise him via electronics – the result is neither pretty nor practical. My grandson climbs and swings at the park, examines caterpillars, sings, and learns about tanks and helicopters.

                Your missive cannot be upvoted enough.  Seen this myself with grandchildren—and even adults.  There is something about TV and those poisonous hand held devices in the hands of children and youths.  I now proudly go about and profess my ignorance using my $800 cell phone.  Yeah, those helping snicker at me on the side I’m sure, but I don’t care.  I can figure out what I have to do, to run the GD EV I bought and to call a number for assistance, screw the rest.But I can see the future, and it ain’t pretty.  Yeah, it’s an “I’ll be dead, screw you.” atttiude.

            Yeah the learning a language part I think Z is a bit premature on. There -will- be a time when we have a universal translator, Star Trek style, but we are not there yet. A few more years at least.I know this because I have been traveling parts of the world in the past year where English is -not- a thing so I have deep experience with the barriers of language.I have 3 translation tools with me at all times. Google Translate (requires internet, not always available), a fairly advanced pair of earbuds that translate in real-time, and an offline translator device. Even with this array of methods at my disposal, things DO get literally lost in translation. So there is a nuance of language that is also lost as well.Second to the still remaining technical limitations and the nuance and sophistication loss, the cold hard reality is, most people do NOT want to talk into a device. This is especially true out in the hinterlands where you are viewed with equal amounts of wonder and skepticism if you come zooming along with all this crazy tech nobody from those parts of the world has ever seen.So I don’t see language skills going out of style in the near future for this multitude of reasons. I think in the very wired world it won’t be as big of a deal. There is already tools in place between places like Japan and the States where real-time translators do some of the heavy lifting but outside of the tech industry and big money business world I think this adoption will be fairly slow.I have been moving around these in between places in Europe and -nobody- has kit like me. The most advanced folks are aware of Google Translate but real time translators like I have may as well be Star Trek tech to them and the offline translator has been a godsend when I’m out in bumf-ck nowhere middle of southern or eastern Europe were cellular is just not reliable.Just wanted to give my ‘expert’ 2 cents on this since I have been directly dealing with this problem most of this year in one way or another. And also the take home point Mycale was making which is that learning a language does indeed massively help with mental acuity in a big way.

        One of the old man’s former coworkers was convinced to come out of retirement ($$$$$) to fix Boeing’s wing to fuselage “problems” with the, I think, 787. The old guy traveled up to Seattle to be met with: “the computer models say”. His response was to drag the whole engineering group down to the prototype and point at the cracks that the models said weren’t there. That guy died eight years ago. Now what?

            Oy. Not the first time I’ve heard such tales around aircraft. Maybe this very tale.
And it illustrates the problem. There’s no understanding that if the model can’t predict the reality, the model is wrong.,… and more than likely was built on a false premise.

                Models produce the result you tell them to.  Read statistician Briggs’ blog,“https://www.wmbriggs.com/“an early reference by none other than Z-man during the scamdemic.Basically, one (implicitly) assumes complete knowledge of the phenomenon in question and therefore an understanding of all the inputs necessary in the predictive model.  This is a high requirement and therefore most modeling does not reach such understanding.Not that incomplete understanding should prevent such modeling—it’s still a good tool for exploring/testing one’s knowledge.  But to make societal policy out of such modeling is quite another story.One of the early modelers, Neil Ferguson, a British epidemiologist and professor at Imperial College London, became a prominent figure during the COVID-19 pandemic due to his work on mathematical models that forecasted the spread and impact of the virus. He was dead bang wrong.His reputation with previous models, like mad cow disease, caused great economic harm, yet his disease modeling was instrumental in the Covid response we all went through.  He was wrong on death rate as well as rate of spread.  His model even panicked the most famous of scientific figures which we discussed in this group at the time.  We were as a group “right”, while the mainstream was “wrong”.John Campbell, whom we often reference in this group, became widely known during the COVID-19 pandemic for his evidence-based analysis of the virus, vaccines, and public health policies.  Problem was, his “evidence” was produced by Neil Ferguson’s faulty model!  John Campbell is still digging himself out from that one.  However in the interest of fairness, he seems to have become a good vaccine skeptic and now in the forefront of analysis of past Covid folly and “all cause” death rate analysis.As I predicted years ago, it looks like the “cure was worse than the disease” wrt Covid.  I leave it to Campbell now to run the eventual number showing more deaths from treatment/prevention than disease.  The numbers are evident now, just not accepted widely.

            As a project manager for one of our largest aerospace firms, the number one way you will get a butt-chewing from me is using computer models exclusively to prove that something will work as advertised.As I always tell young engineers so dependent on the models, there are factors that the programmers of that model haven’t anticipated because they’re flesh and blood humans who are as imperfect as you are. Trust, but verify.Models and computer-aided design tools are exactly that: Tools. They’re not always correct. They must be checked and rechecked by other methods. My young engineers laugh at my slide rule, but I always tell them the Wifi can go down, the electricity can go kaput, but as long as I have working fingers, my slide rule works like a champ.We also used to say in the Air National Guard that there is no better sensor than the old Mark One Eyeball.

                You went from MD to aerospace project manager?  There must be an interesting story there.
Models offer the illusion of proof and I try not to depend too much on them because you can usually set up a similar model with just a few alterations that gives a different result.
As much as I like the game theory models that show that cooperating (ethnic) players beat individualist (white) players, I’m pretty sure that a dedicated civic nationalist could create a game theory model that validated his views.

        Once upon a time, important knowledge was known as wisdom, and it was useful because it helped you to survive and thrive in your local environment. And intelligence was simply the predilection of living one’s life under the influence of this wisdom. And it was self-reinforcing because being smart kept you alive and reproducing, whereas being stupid generally got you dead. Then civilization happened and the natural gauntlets of selection disappeared. We now live in a world in which being a parasite is a success strategy, at least in the short term. But you cannot eat an internet search event.

            My formulation:  Intelligence is the ability to recognize patterns in data and further to generate new ideas from those recognized patterns.
Having a good memory allows your pattern matcher more data to draw on, but the engines are the pattern recognizer and the pattern extrapolator.

                Funny thing is, YouTube videos don’t cover 100% how to fix issues you may have.Case in point: My nine or ten year old lawn mower (not sure when I bought it) decided last week would be a good time to die. Would start, run for a few minutes, lose power and die. I wasn’t too worried about it as I’d seen it do that before. Off to the hardware store for a new air filter and spark plug, and a few shots of Sta-Bil Start! in the gas tank. Fix ‘er right up.Nope. 👎 Still does the start, run, sputter, die.Go on YouTube: Well you probably have bad gas in the tank. Gasoline with ethanol attracts water. So I disassemble the top end of the engine, pull the tank, drain it, clean it, pull the carburetor bowl off, drain it, clean it, spray Gumout carb cleaner in the carb, reassemble everything, and put fresh gasoline in.Nope. 👎 Still does the start, run, sputter, die.It’s probably the carb needle, jet, or the float. At this point I’m not rebuilding the carb just to have this happen again next year, even after adding Sea-Foam additive to the can of gasoline I have. I’ve sunk over $100 in this damned thing over the last two years. I now have a new mower and the hunk of junk that is the old mower is going to a metal recycler to be crushed and melted down. On the plus side they’ll pay me for the metal. 👍

                    Go to the lawn mower section of “My Tractor Forum”. Chances are someone there knows exactly how to fix the old mower… lost of collectors and shade-tree mechanics there. Yours is a common problem. (In the case of one I have and haven’t got round to fixing, it’s cuz I’d used it to cut too many big weeds and sheared the flywheel key.)
And if you leave it on the curb, someone will take it and fix it, and avert a bit of waste (and loss of perhaps irreplaceable parts).

Already left it on the curb. In our suburb we don’t have the VIBRANT! metal pickers like we used to back in Silly-nois.
At this point I want to be paid for it to be crushed, cubed, and melted down. With a vengeance. 😈

                    I have a similar experience recently with my 11-year-old lightly used pressure washer. Electric start never was reliable so left to rot. One day the pull starter cord was stuck. I got mad at the unit but at least did not get violent (Did I mention I’m prone to vexation? I have mellowed a bit with age. I was the small child that smashed toys that “broke.”) I was angry enough to swear off repairing the unit, since I have to hire a service to come pick up the unit, repair it, bring it back. In a fit of annoyance, I offered to give the “broken” unit to a handyman neighbor. He’s laid up sick so he wasn’t in a position to run over and get the unit.A day or two later, after cooling down I took another look at the washer. I was able to remove five bolts and was able to turn the wheel (crank shaft?) after all. Reassembled. Tested and what do you know? It works.Meanwhile, I’ve priced new pressure washers. I can buy a new electric one that would be adequate ego my uses for about $220. My current was about $750 in 2013. It’s probably overkill for my needs. Here’s a valid point, though: since I have to farm out any repairs, even a routine oil change or repair busted starter cord, etc. will run $100-200. Based on expensive maintenance or repair of an infrequently used gas model, I’m probably money ahead to buy the cheapo electric washer.I’ll still give the unit to my neighbor, even if it’s in working condiiton not busted as I offered it – but only if he takes me up on my promise!

                    I have the opposite example – YouTube kept my mower going for years after I would have probably gotten rid of it. My mower just stopped mid-mow one day, and I searched the Toro model. There was a video that showed how to unscrew a bolt (sorry not sure what the part was) which had a small hole running through it. The hole had some debris which I cleared out, and sure enough it started running right away. Same thing happened a couple years later, did the fix and got it running again. Finally replaced it but definitely a good example of how useful YouTube can be.

            The knowledge (repair manual, YT, memorized) is vital but not sufficient.  One must also have the willingness (there are things my husband knows how to do, or could find via YT, but is not willing to take the time and would rather pay someone else).  Finally, one needs the ability –  to wit, I now know how to lever down the spare tire in our 4runner, but I still can’t do it and change the tire myself.

        “No one owns a map, much less has the ability to use one to navigate.”I’ve found it really handy that no one knows how to read a map.  It means they can’t read Google maps either. They can’t read any of the part of the map that is in gray, those roads don’t exist for them.  My city is known for its nightmarish traffic but I’m constantly getting out of it by just driving on the gray and there’s never any traffic. It’s really pretty amusing.We’re all just waiting aren’t we.  This house of cards, this Tower of Babel, how can something so seemingly fragile continue to grow?

            About 20 years ago, I and my daughters would take yearly driving trips to different areas of the country. We used the big Atlas that was available, and marked it up with notes and such.
Mile markers were very helpful when I realized what they were!
Except for Alaska and Hawaii, we visited every capitol. (Carson City we just drove through and waved, as they wanted to get to San Francisco.)
I still have those oversized maps, and we occasionally will get them out and reminisce.

                I spent a couple nights in jail in Carson City one late teenage weekend. Wild trip in S. Lake Tahoe in the late 70’s. From my perspective your not missin’ nuthin.

                    In The Shootist, John Wayne’s final film, Carson City actually looked pretty nice. Of course, it was filmed in 1976, and Hollywood can create the looks it desires.

            LOL, it wasn’t any better in the era of Thomas Brothers map books. People stuck to the red lines, and left the grey lines to the more adventurous. Back in the day I had a street route from south L.A. all the way to Hollywood that didn’t hit any traffic until Sunset Blvd, even during rush hour.One day I was somewhere in south Pasadena, trying to reach the Foothill Fwy, and traffic was snarled up like superglue. But a line of cars was turning into an alley, and that was flowing. So I followed them. Out from the alley, up a side street, into another alley, up yet another minor street, and fetched up at the on-ramp!Nothing beats local knowledge.

                When the lady in the radiator (iPhone) gives me inefficient directions, typically an extra couple turns through a neighborhood to “skip ahead” to a thoroughfare intersection, there’s often somebody following me. I always wonder if their phone is misleading them too, or if they’re tailing me thinking I know something their phone doesn’t.

                There’s something very satisfying about learning a new alley trick — seen some doozies in Bangkok, Chiangmai, and Jakarta.
The flip side was early 2Ks when in-car GPS went mass-market: you’d get quiet neighbourhoods all over the West suddenly experiencing insane through-traffic because a routing algorithm had worked out that it was more efficient than taking the main road route at rush hour.

        Having thought a great deal about this issue, a few fundamental problems exist.1) The passivity. If the information is complex, students lack the self-esteem and intelligence necessary to understand the material. They simply transcribe an answer; their brains do nothing. This further couples with the inability to actually use these search engines. The idea of using keywords or phrases, and the need to revise them for jargon in a particular field, is lost on them. In short, if the answer is not the first response in these search engines of LLMs, they are unable to do anything further.2) The arrogance. Ease of access to information has led to gross overestimates of their own knowledge.

            It’s also very easy to get an LLM to hallucinate if you really dig deep into a topic. I would go as far as to argue you don’t understand the material until you know how to get an LLM to go off the rails discussing it.

            When this country was primarily of European descent, then teaching students how to understand the material and engage their brains was useful, and many/most could do it in some form or another. However, that’s not the case anymore. I bet that 60%+ of students in school today can do little more than transcribe material, and a huge chunk of those students struggle to even do that. That’s where we are at now, and we are getting to the point where it will be basically illegal to teach students of European descent how to engage their brains (if we aren’t already).This is why the regime has such an interest in LLMs, and why they are demanding that the companies make them program them the way they want them to. They understand how useful it is for control. They know that if a student gets an assignment on, say, Rosa Parks, they will go to ChatGPT, ChatGPT will give them the essay, the student doesn’t think, yet internalized the myth of Rosa Parks.

                Having a front seat to the downfall of the West, I cannot help but agree. I would also point out a couple more issues: 1) This dumbing down hides the demographic reality of performance, and 2) The addiction to technology truly ruing brains, creating the same pattern of brain damage found in long-term cocaine addiction (thinning of the cortex).

        It’s difficult to know where ignorance ends and stupid begins with some people. Short personal story – I inquired about towing my deer damaged pickup home and the car rental dude over the phone argued with me that a damaged radiator shouldn’t stop me from driving the truck. I hung up instead of educating him. Stupid knows no bounds.

You can drive it with a leaky radiator.

More likely the dude was lazy and didn’t want to rent you a car. Customer service, what it be?

                Nonetheless, bad info. Why? Because with most insurance I’m familiar with, you are required to mitigate damage within your control. Drive your “radiator-less” truck until the engine freezes and see how fast (not) they stroke you a check at claims adjustment.

            You can drive a car with an empty radiator on a 500 mile interstate trip in the heat of a southern summer and it should be fine. (I’ve done that) The air will cool it. You just can’t idle or go slow for very long.

        “Education in this age is about passing through a series of gates to get a credential.”-This reflects my experience as a former professor. 25 years ago, you could still engage students. They would listen to lectures, take notes and interact. You could try to draw the disinterested or lazy ones in.About the time of the second Obama administration, I noticed a palpable change in the students. The ones who grew up having cell phones and Google their entire lives were almost totally disinterested. They had no interest in dialogue, they would not read assignments. They would enter the classroom, and immediately pull out their cell phone and start finger-fucking it. Even after being admonished, they would do it again.Not every single one of them, of course But a lot of them. It became clear to me that anything they thought they needed to know could be Googled, so the only reason they were in college was to get a credential. They had registered for the class, and thought that was enough. They expected to pass without doing anything.The cell phone is a deadly addiction that rots the brain. I always wondered what they were doing on the damn thing. On a few occasions, I would stop lecturing and say “Who are you texting? Your girlfriend? I’ll send her a text!”More than once, the student sheepishly responded “My mom…”

How true.  Part of this rot has to be public speaking.  I still remember a recent coworker who was in “Toastmasters International”.  When an instructor, I guess you take such for granted, and you developed such over a lifetime of work—but when you are not, those skills need to be developed.  The gentlemen in question realized that he needed this skill to advance in his profession—even nerds have to talk to those with authority.
I have to give him credit.

        The old shorthand way of assessing intelligence made sense because intelligent people are curious and tended to read a lot, accumulate information and have an extensive vocabulary. The old SAT was a proxy for an IQ test and was so considered by MENSA until the 1994 SAT. The old SAT was convenient for colleges and universities because it allowed them to select students for their intelligence without the eugenicist taint associated with IQ tests. Of course, that could not last because the same people who scored high on the SAT were the same people who scored high on IQ tests. They are bad, melanin-poor miscreants who should have no place on a college campus.

            “…the same people who scored high on the SAT were the same people who scored high on IQ tests.”This is correct, however my theory is that the SAT’s and other college entry exams like the ACT and such were/are being discontinued because they are a “tell” of sorts which allow a trace back (assessment) of poor admission standards linked to acceptance of minorities who in turn are linked to poor performance in their majors.  Getting rid of such data is a big step to reducing such scrutiny.  The next step—which is to reduce standards—is already well underway.  We see this in both law schools and med schools.  States are proposing an elimination of their Bar Exams and med schools their yearly advancement exams within med school classes.

        I don’t know. Maybe you are pointing out the difference between information and knowledge. We use knowledge to formulate newideas and create new knowledge and inventions. If we do not understand information, we can’t use it to expand our knowledge.    Having a large vocabulary also helps because we think in language.

            because we think in language
Hear, hear! Wittgenstein held that language was isomorphic with thought — we don’t always think using words, but there is a very strong family resemblance, and our linguistic-conceptual capacities determine our comprehension of the world. I won’t say more, because the Sapir-Whorf Hate Crew will show up.

                Very much in the Sapir-Whorf camp.There is, however, a huge issue in the West with our Cargo Cult Elite: i.e. what Steve Hsu calls ‘Wordcels’ — people who can verbally ‘hand-wave’ but can’t do the maths and other types of hard thinking. Classic Ivy Grad ‘High Verbal IQ’ types who tell Appalachian coal miners to ‘Learn to Code’ (which they themselves cannot do).Vocabulary and Language — whether it be English vs. Chinese, Leibniz vs. Newton, or C19 Quaternions vs. Vector Analysis — absolutely do channel and suggest divergent paths of thought and development… but verbal facility alone does not a thinker make.

Precisely…and why the Left loves to redefine the meaning of words whenever they sense an advantage to such.

        Our current problems are largely caused by the easy availability of technologies like the Internet and smart phones (pocket computers). Idiotic masses now think they know everything and should have a say about everything.
People who learned a new language and “memorized” a lot of facts are/were usually smart. It’s not just a mindless stereotype (most stereotypes are true). People whose top intellectual achievements are knowing how to use a phone or talk to LLM chatbots are unimpressive and should not be allowed in any important positions of authority.

                If you are talking about Protestantism basically destroying the authority of the Church (the intellectual part of society in the past), then there are a lot of people who would agree with you.

        Statesmanship and statecraft requires extremely well-read, well studied people who have the ability to do the following. Take what is known at the time to be the raw facts. Take the best guesses and understand them as best guesses and then make the inferences needed to apply that knowledge to current circumstances to make great decisions. A large number of such people are requiredAs important, those people must share a common bond, a common heritage and a common interest that contributes to the common understanding that must be the foundation of the expertise required for high stakes statecraft.You cannot make high stakes decisions by asking an LLM for the answer. At least, you cannot make it if the LLM has filtered out the prescient information in the name of (psychological) safety, inclusion and belonging. That of course ignores the malevolent assumptions of the Nuremberg Regime that are now baked in to the LLM. We see it in the white erasure and cultural genocide they promote and display with the greatest moral certainty by the people who train these models and use the understandable outrage of its victims as proof that they must do more as the Nazis are out there and their outrage at the promotion of their genocide is proof of the need to snuff them out once and for all.LLMs do not have knowledge, much less intelligence. They make highest probability calculations that compute the most likely sequence of words and then generate them. But they compute this based on the data set they have been trained with. Replacing Kings with Kangz is the order of the day. They have solved the Turing test. That is impressive.What happens when the people who receive that output have no capability of knowing that it is wrong because the training data is highly biased. In fact, the trainers said it is unbiased so therefore it must be unbiased. We have a glimpse of this already. What I have described as the way the models are trained is the way that the academy from 5-Phd has trained these walking LLMs we called the credentialed class for many decades now.Look at the mess they have already made. It is just getting started. Someday, the future will belong to those who invested the effort to read the great works and make proper sense of them and use that to make proper sense of the world around them. They will be accompanied by people who can train models on data that ignores the fake concerns of safety, inclusion and belonging that are mere fig leafs for a malevolent agenda of total destruction. Rather they will be trained on the data that is essential to the agenda of creation, preservation and perpetuation of the highest good the best good and the most magnificent of beauty.It is time to get to work.

        I like to joke that i never broke a 1000 score on my SATs. (Which is true.)At the time, it seemed devastating and I inferred that I was dumb.But in hindsight, I was either lazy or just a bad taker of standardized tests.Probably a bit of both.in the ensuing 30+ years, I realize that in fact, I do have some brains in my head, but it took a while to discover that fact. Maybe because I learned two different foreign languages with relative facility.But whatever.What really matters these days is MINDSET which is not always a sub-set of intelligence.it’s really a minefield out there, so asking questions helps, too.The ClotShot decision was an indicator of this “test.”Many high-IQ people made dumb decisions about that one.

                Covid propaganda was perfect midwit/nerd bait. People who remember what they learn and integrate it into their understanding of the world—e.g., that time in a middle school science class when the teacher introduced viruses by explaining why “There’s no cure for the common cold”—quickly deduced the reality of the situation. People for whom school is recitation, homework, andcomfort thereinbecame partisans of The Science. It let them be teacher’s pet again.

        Very thought-provoking! I would perhaps offer the metaphor of the toolbox here. The LLMs and AI are like a toolbox in many regards. You still have to know which tool to take and how to use it. Access to statistics doesn’t teach you the difference between correlation and causation, for example. Knowing how to say something in Japanese doesn’t give you the understanding of whether or in what context to say it. Facts are just facts; inferences, conclusions and hypotheses are the stuff of business and life in general.

            Quite right about the language. Twelve years ago I was taking a basic Arabic class at the local CC. I also had the Rosetta Stone program for Arabic which I was studying at home. My professor asked if he could see the program and after viewing it, he remarked that it was ok, but that there are too many inflections in the language that are not covered. He further stated that the version of the program was what he called “Modern Standard Arabic”, what you would hear/read on Al Jazeera. He was teaching us a more colloquial/street version of Arabic, something practical one would use if you were walking around in country, how to read street signs and the like. Something like language is only going to go so far with the current iteration of the toys we have now, for the moment. This isn’t taking into account dialects as well.

                I am brushing up on languages now and decided to check out the free version of DuoLingo Italian.  It is useful, but since I actually used the language exclusively for a year and then taught it at university level (thirty years ago) I can say it  has some shortcomings.  One minor, but irritating, point is half the animated characters are non-white and for some reason the most common character is a Sikh.  I have never met a Sikh in Italy.

        “If the power goes out, our advanced skills at finding information on the internet quickly becomes a liability. Suddenly we are in a world of simpletons who do not know how anything works.”
Literally. My sister was from the last class of architects that learned how to do blueprints with paper and pencil. When the power goes out, she’s the only one in the office (of 50-odd people) who can keep working.
At $300 per billable hour, this rapidly becomes significant.

        This is simply a case of technology turning us into cognitive eggplants, just as labor-saving devices have turned us into flabby, indolent rutabegas. And it also, perhaps not coincidentally, aids the sort of people who seek to dumb down society in the name of equalitarianism.As an aside, a few years ago I was talking to a history professor who was something of a mentor to me in my undergrad days. He told me that his university history department dropped compehensive exams as a Ph.D. requirement, allegedly because people can now find all of the requisite historical information on the Internet rather than memorize it.I shook my head and chuckled ruefully, and then told him what should have been obvious: comprehensive exams are not mechanical skills tests; they are intelligence tests. As such, they are a winnowing device. Those who pass comps are presumably smart enough to get the Ph.D. in history; those who fail are not.This is undeniable. The intelligence required to find the difference betweenpomesteandvotchinalandholding on the Internet is nowhere close to that required to memorize and recapitulate huge amounts of data on Russian serfdom and fashion it into a coherent and persuasive argument on the reasons for its origins and the ramifications of its dissolution. Anybody who thinks otherwise is deluding himself.

            Dropping comps for a Ph.D.? That’s fucking ridiculous, but I’m not surprised.The point of comps was never to repeat rote learning, but to be able to defend a position via the Socratic Method. Perhaps a lot of comps never really worked out that way and ended up being a pro forma event, but the general idea was to show that you were able to partake in intellectual debate.A doctorate has simply become another Regime credential. If you are an obese lesbian woman of color and register for enough postgraduate Women’s Studies classes, they will award you one.At this point I am almost embarrassed to tell people I hold a doctorate. In many ways I am proud of the knowledge and critical thinking skills I acquired, but it never made me any money and doctorates have become almost completely debased by the fat queer womyn of color who demand that strangers address them as “Doctor” on an airplane.College has become Sovietized. In the USSR, getting into grad school and completing a doctorate signaled above all else that you were not an ideological threat to the regime.

                Not sure about your experience but in my grad program we had both written and verbal comps. You did the written first, answering sets of questions in five subject areas, and then discussed and defended your answers in the verbal section. And they were notpro forma. Quite a few people were washed out of the program by comps.

                “At this point I am almost embarrassed to tell people I hold a doctorate.”It really never comes up any more, if it ever did.  At university, it was assumed, so no big deal—doesn’t everyone have a doctorate?  At my societal interaction level, there are no people to impress and absolutely no one cares.  Last time I discussed such was to a question by my physician who wanted to get to know me and my lifestyle.  Before that—like 40 years, I got a clock with a built in plaque stating name and completion date for the PhD to keep in my office from the in-laws who were enthusiastic that their daughter made the “right choice”.  😉

                There’s a pretty-well-known anecdote about a PhD student taking his orals. One of the examiners asked him to recite a certain formula. The student said, “Well, I don’t have that at my fingertips, but if I need it I know where to look it up.” The examiner replied, “If you ever needed it, you need it now.”

        It’s a bit like math. The calculator can do the number work – though the student may not realise when an input error has been made. For mathematical understanding you need to do some work, to have a rough idea what a correct answer might look like.You have to know enough to ask the right questions, and to recognise a dodgy answer – even now ChatGPT gets a bit preachy when you ask about contentious matters.There is a danger that people will become too trusting, too obedient and inclined to groupthink. Already on social media people will lob around facts and questionable assertions like hand grenades without deeper analysis and an attempt to arrive at a nuanced consensus.We could end up like some dogs that have been bred for such a narrow skull that it restricts their brain size; fast but dumb.

        I consider looking up things on the internet to be akin to the hard drive, and the stuff in the brain the cache, ram, etc. This means that while the information is there, the speed hits you get with accessing the info will slow your thought process to a crawl. Also, like programming, the constant context switching is an incredible amount of overhead and will vastly impact your computing power.This doesn’t even get into the matter of synthesizing the data in a meaningful way, or having the gut instinct for what data makes sense and what is nonsense. Just because you have access to data doesn’t make it reliable.

        “You will no longer have to be clever to search the internet for answers to your questions.”No, but you will have the be “smart”.  Or somewhat smart and educated to discern what it is that the AI tells you is fact, or at least all the facts/opinion necessary regarding your query.A few weeks ago, I mentioned an article by Ron Unz, everyone can look it up on his site.  Ron is a smart guy—who has time and money—so he bought license from Google to access their ChatGPT software to build his own AI’s.The Unz Review has many long time authors who have published millions of words on his site over the years. He created AI’s using his articles and “personal” AI’s for a number of other long-time publishers using their past articles as input data.He then posed any number of questions to Google’s ChatGPT and his “Unz ChatGPT”.  Questions like, “Who killed JFK”—a topic that Unz has written about extensively over the years.  The answers given by each are at times disturbingly different.  Similarly, a ChatGPT for intelligence researcher, James Thompson, produces some very different results to queries involving genetic differences among the races.  Thompson is a distinguished retired academic who reviews many journal articles in his postings on Unz.In short, what comes out of Google’s ChatGPT is a function of what goes in and the LLM manipulation of such to reach an answer to your query.  Now Unz does not attempt to claim his ChatGPT holds the truth, while Google’s does not.  Only to warn through a practical experimentation of the potential for bias on the part of Google—such made especially explicit when one notes that all of Unz site’s publications are online and freely available to the Google folks who claim to be scrounging the Internet night and day to feed their AI, and yet queries made to Google’s ChatGPT often do not even mention aspects of information/opinion produced by UnzGPT.Simple data facts, like how many feet in a mile are really not the issue here.  The response to questions of a controversial nature are!  As with Wikipedia, where we found a persuasive idea—that of many minds converging upon the ultimate truth—failing in application because of human factionalism.  So too may we find Google’s ChatGPT and AI in general failing to become the Wikipedia follow on “Oracle” of truth.Don’t sell all your books, drop out of school, and rely on your cell phone just yet.  You’ll be “caught up” sooner or later.(Disclaimer:  I use ChatGPT often to confirm “facts” in commentary, but not for what I don’t already know.  Just to refresh a weakening mind about that which I once did know and had at the tip of my tongue when a younger man.  This use probably can work, but the reverse?  One would quickly be seen in this group as aposeur—a term of derision I’m certain no one wants to be know by.

            A question of what information and how deep it is “buried”.One thing learned as a new graduate student was concepts in measuring learning.  You know, we do this all the time starting in grade school with written exams.  However, it’s much more complex than that.  What is knowledge and how it’s remembered/stored?One way to avoid typical recollection tests for long term memory—which is there, but harder to recover—is to measure time to mastery upon “retraining” of the material once previously learned.  Folks can open a semester text book, and read it in a night and be back where they were measured 10 years previously on tests.  I bet it’s something similar when you hear the song on your head set.  It’s just a matter of recovering lost brain synapses.

        It’s the difference between being smart and being Ben Shapiro smart. Ben Shapiro is assumed to be intelligent becuase he can recite the orthodoxy very quickly. His entire conception of reality is mercenary, his current programming is the RNC plank.In contrast, the ability to create inferences from information and synthesize new connections will never be replicated by LLMs becuase they are shackled.Much like how future humanity will rely on the ability to say no-no words to distinguish themselves, future intelligent people will demonstrate novel takes backed up by “apprived” anecdotes.

        Almost no measure of intelligence counts how many bits and bytes of information you can remember.  Yes, memory is important to intelligence just as storage on your computer (or wherever) is important to completing tasks quickly.Intelligence is about PROBLEM SOLVING skill.  Problem solvers with strong memories are better problem solvers, and also faster.I taught for a long time.  Clock speed (like a computer) is key, memory is another key, and logical thinking is essential.  There are other traits, too.Access to information like Einstein quipped, is not the most important one because all the memory in the world can’t help you ask the right question or analyze the situation.

                Ostei:  I was going to ask if you came up with those four “Cs” or if they were a common definition – so I looked them up.  Thoroughly modern and intelligent people, I am informed, consider the four Cs to be “critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.”  What a difference – not merely generational divide but also values.  I much prefer your Cs.

                    Perfect example of what I’ve said before wrt AI.  Try asking ChatGPT:
”What are the 4 C’s of intelligence?”
You won’t get your answer.  Only by a general Google search does a reasonable answer emerge about 5 entries down the page.

                Like I said, problem solving ability.  I taught for a long time.  I couldn’t stand clever reductives then, and I still don’t today.  4C’s is clever for remembering by people with short memories and low intuition.  But (as you pointed out) it’s unnecessarily restrictive because alliteration and cleverness takes precedence over utility and practicality.Wanna know who your intelligent kids, friends, coworkers, are?  Give them a challenging problem to solve, and watch who develops a fast, efficient, and novel, solution.  And chances are good they drew a picture of it to help them think clearly.Computation – logical thinking – is the only one of those 4C’s that can be quantitatively measured.There are different kinds of intelligence, as Zman hints at.  Linguistic, mathematical, artistic, emotional, etc.Each of them exists to solve a particular type of problem.  But like all specializations, the more of each one you have, the more intelligent person you are.We call them polymaths.  Like Benjamin Franklin.The simplest most powerful way to understand intelligence, however, is problem solving ability.

                    Years ago as a young undergraduate student, we learned of studies which measured time in discussions with groups of individuals.  Without fail, those who opened their mouths the most, were “judged” the smartest ones among the group. Analysis of the conversation however would not lead to such conclusion.  Things seem never to change.

                        I used to work with a guy who would gush waterfalls of words without taking a breath.  The senior exec we worked for joked with me one day after a lengthy download from my colleague, “Many words get spoken, very little gets said.”  I always like that.What you find over time in any organization is that the problem solvers invariably either rise to the top or become the people who leave and the organization caves in.  The loud and fast talkers eventually run things into the ground.That being said, linguistic skills – those with the ability to string words together and thoughts together quickly – do possess traits of intelligence and can often serve as “spark plugs” to get things going.  You just have to use them right – get the engine started – and then turn it over to smarter people who can problem-solve and execute.

                    But what conduces to solving problems? Computation, which is the ability to analyze large data sets and apply the analyses to problems expeditiously. Capacity, which is the ability to memorize and access large amounts of useful data on demand.As for curiosity, have you ever known an intelligent person who had no interest in discovery, knowledge and understanding? AFAIC, this is the basic hallmark and indicator of intelligence.Creativity is more debatable, and it certainly applies more to the artistic aspects of the mind than to other components. However, the great artistic geniuses, those people whose work was largely definted by creativity, also tended to be highly intelligent. Is that mere coincidence? I don’t think so.

                        I taught maths and physics for years.  Computation is usually towards the END of the problem-solving.  The first several steps are figuring out what the problem is to be solved.Physicists in particular tell students, “Look up the formula” rather than memorize it.  Or, better yet, DERIVE the formula you need based on the parameters you know, don’t know, or can be eliminated (zeroes).  I often gave +1 point on any test question if the student could draw an accurate portrayal of the problem to be solved with correct labels (velocity, distance, acceleration, force-body diagrams, etc.).  That’s the hard part.  The computation flows from understanding the question to be answered.It’s like picking out a wrench.  Anybody can pick out a wrench, but did you pick the correct one for the job to be done?My brightest students picked up quickly on the importance of being able to correctly conceptualize the problem.  It also made their computations more accurate because nonsensical answers – which are easy to make when plugging values into formulas – are easier to spot if you understand the problem you are trying to solve.Computation is important…just ask those NASA engineers who crashed a probe into Mars because one team used Standard units and another team used Metric units, and disaster ensued.

        The online versus in-mind debate is an interesting one. Access to online knowledge has made printed encyclopedias almost obsolete. Looking up a subject online is simply faster, and the articles can be continuously updated. Then again, an encyclopedia from the 1920s may feature a map with concentric circles radiating outward from Northwest Europe to show the origins of the most and least desirable immigrants, which would be banned onWikipedia. There are similar tipping points with language. Translator apps are genius for travel. But they become awkward, to say the least, when you live and work in a country where almost nobody speaks English. In fact, humans are well-adapted to deal with this problem. The human mind is good a scrubbing extraneous data which is not used in our daily lives(analogous to bit-rot on computer storage devices). So the cramming we do for an exam is forgotten almost as quickly as last week’s grocery list.

Same here in the rest of this state, as well as the forgotten areas of Virginia, Pennsylvania and a few other states I’ve had the chance to observe closely.retired minister friend who covers two small churches in a very remote county of Old Dominion reported yesterday a relevant event involving a young couple just affiliated with the congregation.  The male half – veteran – announced that he had a bulldozer, and was departing to Western NC to help out. Someone asked if he needed any money. After a minute he said: “Well, I wouldn’t turn any down.”He walked out with $5,000 to help fund his trip.i lived among these guys in a pretty much closed community for about 2 years. They are (were) old school civnats. The younger ones, though, and some of the older ones, have been ‘becoming’   Something different.they all hunt (even the black ones) both for subsistence and for sport, as well as, because, it’s what they’ve done for generations there, or even centuries now.these seem to be the same sort of guys who, throughout out r history,might just decide it’s time to stand up and do even more, as our culture falls apart …

        Comparing intelligence to computers, the ability to remember things/store data is represented by computer’s memory.  The ability to process/analyze/synthesize and make information useful is represented by the computer’s processor.  Which makes one more intelligent, remembering facts, figures, dates and languages or synthesizing data to solve your problems?  Hard to say since they work in synergy with each other.  The more worrying aspect is that they’re conditioning each successive generation to eschew committing anything to memory and outsourcing the processing of info to AI or other regime approved technologies.  The livestock-ification of humanity continues unabated.

        You can’t communicate effectively in a foreign language via a smartphoneThis is a silly premiseYou can be probably be more effective using your hands and body language than talking into a phone and having Siri, for example, translate to a foreign listener.There is no easy way.  If you want to learn a foreign language you have to put time and effort into it.  Relying on your phone instead lol.  I don’t think so.  Not to mention all the nuances and idioms that will take a massive database to assemble, and no programmer is going to bother with anything that complicated unless you pay up for it.  So I guess the GPS location will trigger which idiom data base of words to access? Please.Get what you pay for, and if you want to be laughed at by thinking some for-free AI program can be your portable translator go ahead

        We are moving from a world where being smart was about memorizing lots of information to a world where being smart means knowing how to find the information quickly and efficiently
I’ve wondered about that.  90% of the issues encountered at the job have a solution on the internet.  I’ll ask myself why someone else didn’t just search for the solution and apply it and the answer was: they couldn’t.  They didn’t know the “secret” sequence to find the fix and then, since it never directly aligns, would have been unable to apply it anyway.

            Being smart also requires that you know what information you need for any situation.The flowchart for dumbfucks gets very messy very quickly when novelty strikes.

The point about the Simpletons is taken, as the over-invoked Austrian Chancellor of Germany remarked “If man lived in paradise he would rot.”
As for context it’s coming along, see Asheville.   Or Ukraine, the dry run for America, and I don’t mean the Russians are coming.
I predict that Rednecks will not only survive the transition but thrive, indeed Triumph.

        Maybe the overall premise is sound, but as I see it the trust problem is too large.  The internet might contain all human knowledge but it also contains all human error, lies, malice, and vice.   To make use of it you have to sift it carefully, and I believe this will only worsen with time.  Now that the search engines are political tools their ability to help in the winnowing process is compromised.When it comes to obtaining useful info online that goes beyond the purely mundane and uncontroversial, I find that virtual ‘word of mouth’ is what I rely on – links provided by trusted sources with specialized interests turn up help/info that you can’t find with search engines unless you have hours to drill down through the results, if even then.  I have to assume this effect will make advanced technical/scientific info unsearchable as well one day, if it hasn’t already.

        I disagree. Knowing only how tofindinformation rather than knowing the information itself is adequate, if all one wants to do is parrot the thoughts and words of others. But the information in one’s memory is an integrated whole that permits one to makenewinferences and createnewmodels. One’s integrated information store provides an ability to understand and interpret reality that a scattered collection of facts online (or even in a library) cannot.

            What you’ve just described is the difference between “fluid” intelligence and “crystalized” intelligence.  Crystalized intelligence is basically defined as facts in memory.  Fluid intelligence is the ability to put those facts to use in creating new understandings and knowledge.  Fluid and crystallized intelligence are two key components of human cognitive ability, first proposed by psychologist Raymond Cattell.Fluid intelligence peaks in the 20’s then decline, while crystalized intelligence continues to grow until the 70’s.  That’s one of the reasons we see so many Nobel prizes awarded to scientists for work done in their younger years—that and it often takes time to recognize the effect of their research on the field.I subscribe whole heartedly to Cattell’s theory and it is discussed widely today in any writings on human intelligence.

        The hardest part about technology is knowing when to stop. More and more, faster and faster, seems to be the mantra that drives us ever onward. But if we just take a deep breath and think about what’s really real, we’ll soon find ways to make the data our friend, rather than our enemy. A lifetime’s wisdom can never be replicated by a machine. Even generative AI is just pattern matching between big fat databases; it’s not a novel thing. To live through something is vastly different from reading it in a book. The Masters of the data may be book smart, but can they put it all together? Can they jump nimbly from one situation to the other? The decentralized collective know-how of the human race is still more effective than pattern-matching AI, which is playing chess by assigning points to each square and deciding on a strategy. The world is infinitely complex, and you cannot put points on it’s squares. The machine can diagnose a medical illness by pattern matching, but it can’t run a civilization, because a civilization is an ever-unspooling fractal, not a brute triangle or cone.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

        This will all be condensed — the metadata — to a ring around one’s finger, and then to a tiny sliver of a chip implanted directly to the brain, much like Elon Musk’s Neuralink project. This means, among other things, the death of Christianity.The cyborgs that walk among us  — with the implant — will soon discover their own cybernetic gods, feigning disinterest in the analog “meat” version.Also, it means the indefinite tyranny of the rich. Hooked up to the internet by expensive micro-boosters, the rich will have a much more colorful, robust experience and be privy to the finest in anti-virus technologyThe phone company where I live has a slogan — the future is friendly. The future not only looks unfriendly, but it has the head of a slavering Rottweiler cranked up on meth. Pity the 22nd century. The inhumanity is just beginning.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
