        Victoria Nuland is taking a much-needed break from the stressful work of blowing up the world. She plans to use her time off to catch up with her witches’ coven, attend black mass more often, and concentrate on her hobby: breeding show-quality vampire bats. She will return as Secretary of State for Gavin Gruesome’s administration.

        Whether either a student or employee, seeking to change the iron law leads to condemnation as a “misfit” and ejected by ‘poor performance.’  Therein is truth, the “organization” functions by the Synagogue of Satan’s penchant of “religiosity of rituals.”The student and employee must fight back … fight back harder … reach for a microphone and cameras to speak out against the evils committed against humanity who refuse to practice the “rituals” inherent of the Synagogue of Satan, and thereby eradicate Satan’s evil on Earth.The alias NULAND’s were arrested by US Military and are by now at Guantanamo Bay (GITMO) awaiting their Tribunal trial, sentencing, and execution for treason (Real Raw News).

        The pajeet is the undertaker of a company.  If you get a pajeet CEO, it’s over.  If you study India you know that its a broken to the core culture.  The even call it the “licensing raj.”  Bureaucratic fiefdoms proliferate like dandelions after a rain storm.  Needless hierarchies are established.   Left to its own devices the company will soon have a temple that worships rats.Don’t be fooled by the “westernized” pajeet.  The CEO of Microsoft, Nadella, can walk around in Steve Job’s old wardrobe.  He’s wearing a costume.  Probably bought it from his widow, but he’s no Steve Jobs.  None of them have a drop of innovation in their blood.  They also hate white people.  Not because they think we’re smarter, but because they know that all class and style emanates from European culture.  And they’ll always be a culture of table cloth wearing street shi-tters.If you let them, all of their own failures will be projected on you in every bureaucratic board meeting.  An innovative white finds this alone to be draining, as you have to stand up for yourself and pull out the hatchet like Jack Nicholson in The Shining every other day.

        Meant to post this in today’s column…Five important things happened this week that are related.1. Trump won 9-0 at SCOTUS. And their ruling was really quite devastating AND SHORT. We may see a rapid end of the J6 and Documents cases. 5-4? Well, maybe presidents aren’t immune. 9-0 in a direct attempt to interfere in an election? Red alert.2. Michelle Obama let it be known she is not running for POTUS, after #1 was announced. The timing was not an accident which leads me to…3. Trump destroyed Nikki Haley 99-3 on Super Tuesday. The Sea Island Billionaire strategy to defeat Trump is dead. Big Mike is not stupid. They see the bloodbath that is coming which includes…4. Sen Kirsten Sinema announced she will not seek reelection in AZ. Voter fraud will not save her. Democrats and their vile policies of the last 3 years have angered the public in ways that are getting out of hand, including specifically Ukraine…5. Victoria Nuland “retires”, which is usually the kind of thing you see happen when the incumbent party either loses, or is about to lose, an election. They go into obscurity to manage the resistance fighters and plot their return to power. Trump is running as explicitly anti-war in Ukraine. Nuland, and her catastrophe there, is now a liability. She also failed in the color revolution against Orban in Hungary. They need her a million miles away and we’ll be treated to a solid 5 months of Biden claiming Ukraine was Trump’s idea, and it failed because of Trump Repubs in Congress. This will not work because Trump has a very long record that also happens to be the one the public massively agrees with. Anyway, they need Nuland to go into hiding because they need to start blame-shifting.This was a landmark week in Election Year 2024. Democrats are increasingly fearful of what they are calling MAGA “anger” and “revenge”. Jan 6th, once an insurrection, increasingly looks like a missed opportunity that MAGA isn’t going to miss a second time.

            It’s not hard to picture the big hebrews getting behind the Orange Man (I’m far from the first person to point out). He’s even more loyal to Israel than Biden. But they’re going to have a tough time selling Literally Hitler to their fellow clouds. Trump hatred is about the only thing that unites the “left” anymore. Probably the only thing that will motivate the fortification machine into action. And it’s questionable if the people at the top can control it.

                If you go back and look at the bilateral accords Trump was negotiating, he was basically ending the for-profit war machines over there…I got into an argument with some Lib on a blog about how many peace treaties Trump had orchestrated.  I got called a liar about 12 times before the retard read the links.  Then I got one reply:  “Oh.  I had no idea.”You have to remember that Trump might be pro-Israel, but largely was defanging the entire mercenary war infrastructure at the same time.Ending the war machine over there kills the power of the Jewish lobby over here.

                    People forget, with all the rampant antisemitism pervasive now, that it used be that if you wanted to get anything done that Jews didn’t like, you had to be kissing their backsides while doing it. I don’t want to side with either Israelis/Jews or Palestinians/Muslims (deport them ALL with their problems and squabbles), but if cooperation with Israel is the price to be paid to ensure a successful mass deportation operation, then that’s just the way it has to be.It’s an imperfect world. WAY THE HELL more Americans are dying than Palestinians, and we have been ethnically cleansed from way more land, too. Not only is no one is looking out for us, but most are hoping we suffer and die. The Pal’s have never done anything for us (or anyone else) to put us into their debt. We are being erased, too. It’s up to the Pal’s neighbors, and their neighbors’ primary objective seems to be to keep the Pal’s from being pushed into their lands. Ours should be, too.

                        Yep, I say it all the time.  Egypt, Jordan, Syria, nobody wants that clan in their country.  The Pali’s are troublemakers wherever they go.  We let them in here, and they started storming children’s Christmas pageants.
Instead of turning Gaza into a tourist beachfront paradise, they stew in their stupidity and ancient hatred’s while their “leaders” rake in billions from their penthouse suites in Qatar.
Bringing them here is suicide.

                The Big Hebrews didn’t support Trump, they were and are threatened by him.  It was the Little Hebrews that supported Trump, the Zionist types.  e.g., his SIL and Netanyahu.  The globalist hebrews didn’t like the idea of their religiously fanatic kin becoming dominant over them, which is why they continue to freak out over Trump.

            Pretty good analysis but I think you are missing a key ingredient. nd overestimating the willpower of the current movement.What is becoming clear is that they are going to let Trump win but I don’t think you have spent enough time thinking about the why…I seriously doubt that the democrats are scared of “MAGA anger and revenge”. They have shit on MAGA people constantly and rubbed our noses in the 2020 loss with great glee since it happened. I empathize with why it’s nice to think that they respect us, but the facts on the ground do not bear it out. For one thing, the “insurrection” was a couple thousand larpers wearing ridiculous costumes. They were never a threat to the established order.At all.Secondly and most probably missed this but SNL did a very harsh skit the other day about Biden’s senility. Ask yourself, when has SNL ever attacked a presumptive democratic nominee before? Don’t you think that is a little strange?My bet it that it seems very likely that they are going to let Trump win in order to cut their losses with the left and do a reset aimed towards preparing for a wider middle east conflict in the medium term.DO NOT JOIN OR LET YOUR FAMILY JOIN THE MILITARY. They won’t be grateful for your sacrifice, they treat Iraq veterans like shit and they will treat Yemen/Iran veterans the same after they have achieved their goals and you are no longer of use. There’s also a much higher chance you will die than there was in the last wars. We have gotten MUCH weaker since the 2000’s thanks to the jewish rot.Silver lining is that the right will get some form of MSM ball puffing with the aim of reversing the military recruitment crisis. But do not forget that any gift ZOG might give us will be a white elephant. Against all objective reason, they will always hate us the most at the end of the day. White Christians allegedly “saved them from genocide” in WWII yet those few who are left are currently getting abused by minorities in nursing homes and the rest of us are slated for a slow and painful extinction by the powers that be.Also, they will probably do a false flag relatively soon. I don’t think enough Americans would agree to fighting for Israel without some kind of extreme diversionary event. I don’t think they can come up with a good enough one though, I hope I’m right.tldr; military recruitment numbers are low and Israel is probably going to need American troops. Trump will be better for that goal, so they are going to let him win.I do not think voting or the red team blue team stuff is going to affect anything but superficial cultural issues, and even then, not by too much.Ask yourself. Did Trump really change much on the cultural front or has it just gotten worse? Both parties are run by the same group, the donor class is the money behind both parties, and what matters to the donor class most is Israel. They will start giving us some of what we want, but only in an effort to coax us into dying for Israel. And if/when that is achieved.. things will become much worse for us very quickly.

                    Well, the first one wouldn’t really exist w/o the 2nd one, right? But! The first one is usually more in your face and immediate. The latter is only for those in the know and understand the nuance. In the end, it’s sort of a toss up I would say for me.

            Lot of symbolic escalation on that front lately. Maybe Nuland’s career change will turn out to be part of it. Depends what’s next.The most notable recent every-single-time event, I think, because she’s a primary author of online conservative “discourse,” is a rhetorical change by LibsOfTikTok. She’s been easing off the homos and pedos and going hard on “white women” lately. She slid into it by blasting fag hag bluehairs, but, e.g., her objection to North Face’s new anti-white marketing campaign is that North Face is run by white people. What an odd thing to say!Remember when Libs was “doxxed” in the Washington Post by Taylor Lorenz—who was given her real name/etc. by a *German intelligence* agent? Sounds like a big deal! Especially to a Jew! What did Libs do about it? Nothing…until last week, when she made a fool (“lolcow” variety) of herself in a very, very, weirdly long video interview with Lorenz—an uncontrolled in-person interview with her deep state nemesis. What an odd thing to do!Conservative response? LORENZ OWNED and also she’s an antisemite. Bond with Libs strengthened; “discourse” shift fully accepted.If only white women voted every election would look like Reagan/Mondale—unless they were the kind of white women we find vastly “overrepresented” on corporate boards. Would pointing this out on a Libs thread at, say, Patriots.win or Ace Of Spades get you banned for judenhass? I think it would.

        Update!
Looks like after they’ve killed off the next Ukrainian generation (“there’s no one left to marry”), they’re going after finishing off the Germans next.More German hawks demanding direct action on or in Russia.

                    The amplification and exploitation of ethnic emnity among their subject peoples is a primary tool of governance of the globalists. Poles are quintessential excitable midwits, seeing the superficial pattern and allowing themselves to be baited. It’s another damn tragedy. I wish they would wise up.
It makes sense to me now that we had Pollack jokes growing up (even though we had no Poles around) but no German jokes, English jokes, Romanian jokes, Irish jokes, French jokes, Italian jokes, etc. It was probably some residual cultural echo from the previous generation.

        As the Devil’s Advocate, what if Her exit simply means the deals have been cut, the papers signed, and the former Ukraine is being parceled out?  This might mean the sausage has already been made, time to wind it up in time for the election.Russia gets the industrial east oblasts with their valuable mines, and another year of war production boosting her and her BRIC allies’ economies.China, while Russia is tied up in the west, gets more illegal timber concessions in Siberia, and more Belt access through the Stans.Poland under Tusk gets Galicia back, and more NGO funding to hound Belarus.Romania gets a port on the Black Sea, like Djibouti, serving all sides, as well as petro pipeline money.The EU gets a firmer WEF grip on its restive populace and more immivasion.The US, the same.  Blackrock scarfs up more of the Fed Reserve’s “assets”.Pritzger, Blackrock, Monsanto ADM Cargill get not only the rebuilding contracts, but the increasingly valuable Ukrainian farmlands as the US and EU sabotage domestic food production.Nuland and Zelensky both get promoted in their own special way;Nuland out of the visible working ranks to upper management, Zelensky to Eichmann   / Epstein status.  Well, they say he’s been disappeared, but who cares?

            This is indeed possible. I didn’t put it on my list below because I  don’t think this US regime is capable of this level of sophistication.
Also, Romania has a Black Sea port already (Constanta) and they’ve been trans-shipping grain (and other things probably) out of Ukraine for quite a while now.

            @alzaebo— Victoria Nuland’s departure from Europe means NO MONEY for Ukraine/Khazar and NO MONEY for Israel. Victoria Nuland and husband Robert Kagan were arrested by Military this week and taken to Guantanamo Bay (GITMO) for Tribunal trial, sentencing, and execution for treason.

        The Managerial Class is subject like all insect colonies to a series of patterns. They repeat endlessly with little variation. When a senior official in the corporate, sportsball, political, or NGO world has a serious scandal they “retire” in words used about Nuland.Nuland almost certainly got caught in Keeeeevvvvvv talking about plans to use the Ukranian intelligence to “kinetically solve” the Bad Orange Man problem. Her husband has basically called out for this. Francis Fukuyama in the FT called for basicallly a Fujimori self-coup two weeks ago. We know that most of the bug people are incapable of even elementary communication security. The German generals in Singapore used hotel rooms and commercial video conferencing software to discuss secret plans. Incompetence rules their lives like most insects they are only formidable in colonies.I assume she’s been retired because it became apparent that the Russians have her on recordings plotting a kinetic solution to the Bad Orange Man with Zelensky’s intel people. Zelensky has a lot of internal enemies in the military aligned with cashiered Zaluznhy so saying anything in and around or connected to Keeevvvvv would be a very bad idea. Boss Karens are only competent playing the “my husband is powerful and I am a stronk and empowered woman” — see Hillary, at Disney Kathleen Kennedy.

Bullshit. The term “military-industrial complex” was coined by Eisenhower, a five-star general, who warned us to “guard against” its influence when he left the presidency in 1961.

People would sometimes find out he was in the service, and they would say, “Thank you for your service.” Without fail, he would reply, pointing his finger for emphasis, “I didn’t do it for you – I did it for me!” The look on the guests’ faces was priceless.

            I don’t know about competent military men being despised, but for the most part, they are just pitied.  Many got suckered into serving after 9/11 for a regime of lies and their time in service wasted.
Raytheon would disagree with you regarding no “I”.  Their stock price has done quite well since February of 22.  There is an MIC and they have been parasitic vampire squid wrapped around the face of the US tax payer.  (H/T to Matt Taibbi)

Is this still true, at least in the uniformed, Pentagon branch of the MIC?  What I’ve seen since Obama doesn’t give me much confidence.  Maybe the corporate side is a bit less ideological, but the big brass and their minions?

        I just finished reading the latest version of The Fourth Turning and if someone here could enlighten me in layman’s terms–do fourth turnings happen simultaneously worldwide, or does a fourth turning in one country precipitate a fourth turning in the adjacent one, like dominoes falling? I seem to recall that Mexico did just fine while American experienced the great depression in the 1930’s.

            Use a bit of caution when considering theories of cycles. If there were such predictability to these things, someone would have figured out how to make a buck on it. So far, it appears the only ones who have done so are authors writing about their pet theory of cycles.

            A little while back, EMJ was talking about a former Israeli PM’s musings on no Jewish kingdom lasting more than 70-80 years, or something like that, and it reminded me of the Fourth Turning. I don’t see Jews in my Cheerios, but I take it as evidence of how shot through we are with Hebrew notions of history, via Christianity, of course. Waiting for The End, and such. FWIW.

                OT I mean, keep what’s good, and finish paganizing the rest. We got halfway there incorporating philosophy— the Greek and Roman Churches. We aren’t Hebrews, there are no magic ideas to make us Hebrews. I guess that’s blasphemous, but whatever. It’s pretty obvious the religion adapted to the nations as much as the nations adapted to it, and this recent effort to re-Hebraize it (Judeo-Christianity) is killing the thing. Jesus brought the sword, cut the umbilical cord!

                    As boring old practicing Catholic, it’s funny to have non-believers (or perhaps partial believers) describe Christianity.The ancient Israelite religion grew and flowered and dropped a seed in Jesus. That seed produced a religion like the old one but also not quite the same. That also grew and flowered, particularly in the West. To the extent that Greeks were tracking down the truth, it’s there in Christian thought. The Greek brought reason to the party while the ancient Israelites were mostly going on direct revelation from God.Modern Judaism, however, is not the ancient Israelite religion. To the extent that people partially believe Christianity they end up quite often with something closer to modern Judaism than Christianity. However, the ancient religion of the Israelites, as was supposed to be practiced in spirit, can only be found in Christianity. Modern Judaism is simply a rejection of Christianity, which is why the only real counter to a Judaic society is to think like a Christian.The original heresy was the Judaizing heresy. That’s what Paul in the New Testament was fighting. In that everything old is new again.

                We are shot through with modern Judaic ideas of history. That is we progress without effort into a utopia and everyone is purple snowflake capable of changing the world..Christianity notes generations but will not discuss necessarily cycles of decay.70-80 years or 3 generations to decay is a modern observation. It has a great deal of evidence to back it up. 40 years is significant in ancient Israelite theology, or 2 generations. But then again modern Jews are not ancient ones. The only people to whom that modern confusion is even vaguely valuable to are the Jews themselves.

            That’s actually a rather good question, since Fourth Turnings correspond with roughly the human lifespan; it’s especially pertinent in the globalized era.

            Would a 4th turning cause calamity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo? How would you tell? I think that’s somewhat analogous to Mexico of the 1930s. The closer you are to the floor to start with, the shorter your fall. This shouldn’t be misconstrued to mean I’m a disciple of Strauss and Howe (or a naysayer). What they say is interesting.

                Believe it or not, when she was young she was pretty hot. Somebody posted a young picture of her next to a current picture in a meme on a different forum and it’s difficult to believe it’s the same woman.

        With the new 007 being a strong independent negress who don’t need no man, you’d think sending her after the deplorables would be the rather obvious move. The villain some “christian nationalist” mega church preacher who is indoctrinating women into having white babies, subverting their natural and proper inclinations to be lesbians or incubate mulattos.
We’re getting real close to the ides of March in “the most crucial election year ever.” Last time we were at that juncture, things changed suddenly.

        Two sidenote’s about Nuland…1. Nuland made an appearance on NPR back in the day, where she blithely discussed working on a Soviet far east fishing trawler in the 80s as an “observer”.  Who does this?  Why?
2. Circa 2016, In a Facebook post, a Russian woman described meeting fellow councilor “Vicky” at a Soviet children’s summer camp in the Ukraine around 1985.  Vicky was took great joy at starving the children, and throwing scraps of food into the dirt, watching the goyim eat the dirty food.  The Russian woman then engaged Nuland in a fist fight.

            Another interesting thing is that she apparently identifies as Jewish. But she isn’t. Her mother was an English Christian. Her father, of course, was Jewish, but as Judaism is matrilineal, it would mean Vicky is not.

                I don’t remember the name of the 10 minute video at this moment, but one fellow showed that the OT is a long string of broken lineages.  Didn’t matter to the Hebrews then, or now.In fact, since I read the Bible as a political history, I say many passages are largely an argument by whatever winning faction at the time as to who could claim legitimate authority, that is, which flag-bearer was more equal than most, that whichever dynasty in power was rightful. Every line in the Book was fought over tooth and nail.  Continuous English royal feuds have nothing new on these guys.

                    Yes, and their history has weighed heavily in the pan. It has been my belief that they stole the idea of  one way, one time Universal History from the Zoroastrians who seem to be originators of that concept – subsequently transmitted down through the Abrahamic religions – after their long term exposure to this belief system. (I first saw this detailed in the work of the scholar of religion, Mircea Eliade.)But, to my mind, they seemed to have gravitated toward Angra Mainyu, the Dark Force, rather than toward Ahura Mazda, the Light Force; the demiurgic character of Yahweh does seem to correspond more closely to Angra Mainyu, after all, a fateful turn. The Zoroastrians, by way of contrast, devoted themselves toward Ahura Mazda, counting Angra Mainyu as The Enemy, the Father of Lies if you will.

            Along those lines, although of course it doesn’t get mentioned, Israel has been neutral about Ukraine if not more or less predisposed toward Russia. Bundling Ukraine and Israel aid as has been proposed is somewhat contradictory.

                Looks to me like they say they are neutral but do in fact support the war.  They had Mossad agents helping Ukraine and they did send some weapons prior to the Gazacaust.
The way I see it if Israel was not in favor of the war in Ukraine then their operatives here (neocons) in the U.S. would not have been in favor of the war in Ukraine.
Just ask Ben Shapiro.

            The profligate killing of Russians and Ukrainians is a win-win for the neocons.  They hate both equally for different reasons.  The secondary benefit of turning Ukraine into an economically destroyed rump state is icing on the cake.  The only way this gets better for the neocons is to keep it going as long as possible.  I listened to a podcast yesterday between Sam Harris and Bret Stephens.  100% of Stephens’ arguments in favor of continuing support and more involvement were based upon false premises and strawman arguments without any challenges from Harris.  These people live in an alternate reality.  I keep hearing happy talk about how releasing the sixty billion held up in Congress will allow Ukraine to “win”.  The cloud people are either well and truly delusional or are some of the most viciously psychotic people to ever occupy the elite outposts in western society.

            This is most definitely not to say that they are not spying on MAGA people, because they most certainly are, and harrassing them unmercifully. In their own fevered brains they probably do consider themselves to be playing a role akin to that of James Bond, though.

        I’m having a bit of trouble reconciling two things you’re saying:1. “The flow of weapons to Ukraine has drained the armories but has not resulted in new cash for suppliers.”and2. “The reason is the cupboards are bare, so the MIC is not going to get much from this scheme. The only reason the Republicans are stalling is they have the full support of the MIC on this.”If the cupboards are bare, surely the MIC would get cash for manufacturing some more? Perhaps I’m mistaken but it seems to me that the Republican politicians are realising that Ukraine is a lost cause and not very popular with their constituents? These politicians don’t march in perfect lockstep with the MIC. Project Ukraine would never have occurred under Trump. This was a project of the Dems along with the three factions you named.

            It’s all just been one big grift to get the money while you can, you have four years to shear this sheep named “Joe Biden”. And none of them give a crap about the military or the US, in fact they hate them. Maybe some of them are realizing that now that their pot of gold came up empty.
And when the big guy gets 10% everyone wants their 10% for helping get him in office and helping with all their many schemes over these long years.

            The problem is that the GAE no longer has the industrial base required to ramp up their output in the way Russia has.
There are multiple reasons this is the case. One good summary from Alex Krainer is here:
https://alexkrainer.substack.com/p/ukraine-war-and-western-systems-fatal
The GAE can add all the zeros it wants to the Project Ukraine spreadsheet. It won’t make a difference because it is not possible to print artillery shells, drones, tanks, and soldiers the way the Fed prints worthless toilet paper.

The MIC gets rich selling (and maintaining) the overly-complex “wunderwaffens” that look great in a powerpoint deck but don’t actually work on the battlefield. Ammo, artillery shells, and FPV drones don’t have anywhere near the needed profit margins.
Said another way: “Nobody gets a 5th bedroom on their Alexandria, VA mansion selling drones and artillery shells.”

        Nuland’s departure is most likely due to one of two things:1) she was covertly planning something even more insane than the Ukraine policy to date and got caught. Biden’s people decided to jettison her as a liability pre-election or,2) Biden’s people have decided to replace Zelensky and the Replacement wants a new US interlocutor because he doesn’t trust the perfidious, meddling Nuland. So she took one for the team and will be on the Boeing board by December.I lean towards explanation 1, but I’m curious what everyone thinks. Fanatics generally get carried out rather than voluntarily walking out.

            Maybe a recording of her ordering and/or monitoring in real time the torture and murder of Gonzalo Lira for her own sadistic pleasure were brought to someone’s attention and while they didn’t care that much, that’s just too petty and evil even for them.
They may have even let that crazed Canadian trans spokesperson carry out the dirty deed. That wouldn’t be a good look if people found that out. Nor would it help their lgbt activism push. No, not at all helpful.

So she’s planning a color revolution and coup d’etat for North America, but it’s too politically dangerous to do so within the Biden regime, esp. during an election year. Plotters need secrecy, and the prez and his handlers must have plausible deniability about knowledge of the insurrectionist plans, in case the plotters are identified and exposed—as they will be after the kickoff.

                    True, but the Bolsheviks guaranteed that there would be no possibility of temporizing when they had the Romanovs murdered. Killing Trump would be driven by a similar calculation. I think that this would be a miscalculation, but these people, being insane and out of contact with the likely resulting realities, might just make it happen

                Luckily, the plotters and schemers are stupid and most people, even if they hate Trump, are just plain tired of the stupid games, disruptive schemes and flat-out idiotic bullshit, it’s so bad that it’s become insulting to the intelligence of even the idiots!I think even their foot soldiers can only get riled up for maybe three days. Then they are tired of it, too. Besides, all the money is gone, and when they don’t get their 10%, the tables may turn on the plotters, then they will have to flee the country. (Which is why they are stealing all the money now, because they know this!)And their imported foot soldiers. It is to laugh. First sign of resistance and no government having their back, they’ll beg to return to their homelands. And America will oblige them.

                Hochul’s installation of the National Guard in New York subways backs up the idea of a domestic color revolution.That is, they are bear-baiting again, the Democrats are prepared to stop the certification and blame the MAGAs for it, ala 2020.They’re fortifying the election against MAGA turrists, side-by-side with the Mayorkas battalions from across the border.  (Conveniently continued with Mexico’s new Yenta President in charge.)I suspect TSA at every BART station and Covid milicias at every supermarket might soon come back as a regular feature of everyday life, just as military police patrols are part of the regular street scene in France.Got your digipass on your phone, citizen?

                    Saw a meme over at WRSA:
– defund police– bail reform– DAs not charging felons– police attacked by uillegals AND released– violent crime spikes– soldiers brought in for policing
It’s a formula.
This seems plausible; yet another way to get the “citizenry” to plead for The Regime to “fix it”, and away we go…

            I’ll vote for 2) because these neocons don’t run off acting on their own. They exercise power as a faction over long periods of time; the Destabilize Ukraine Project started at least as far back as 2014, with Cookies herself passing out treats in person to the Maidan coup crowds. We already know Grandpa Stinkfinger actually dislikes Zelensky, and we know factions in Kiev are restive about him, including the mayor of Kiev, Gas Princess Timoshenko, Zaluzhny, the ultra-nationalist Right and lots of lower tier military; Syrsky has been sacking his generals left and right to replace them with puppets loyal to Zelensky. It looks like 404 is ripe for a coup in the coming six months. This vampire Nuland may either be dodging a hot potato, or more likely she was told by her co-conspirators to step aside because she no longer serves a purpose given the coming collapse of 404. Let John Bass hold the bag like he did in Afghanistan.

        My guess is that Nuland decided to leave on her own volition because she sees the funding for Ukraine drying up and the situation on the ground deteriorating. Better to get while the gettin’s good and leave some other hapless schmucks holding the bag when it finally implodes.At the same time, Israel is engaged in wiping out the Gazans and expanding greater Israel. It’s inevitable that the Gaza Strip gets annexed for Zionist settlement. Since Israel has always been Priority #1 for the (((neocons))) and that’s where the action is right now, I would expect to see her resurface shortly in some kind of role justifying the Israeli takeover and settlement of Gaza and getting the U.S. taxpayers to fund it.

        Interesting take. Thanks.
I’d assumed the ugly bitch stepped down simply to avoid being held responsible for what happens next in the Ukraine )ray; sinking ship). You’ve definitely established there may be a myriad of factors involved.
I will say though, that if this summer is as good for Russia as you suggest, say something like 1944 was for the Red Army, things are going to get very interesting indeed.
Unfortunately it may be so in the manner of the Chinese curse: “May you live in interesting times.”

        I’m going with the theory that Chubby Vicky, like Vichy Mitch and even the Wise Latina, Jumanji Brown and the the other robed clowns are beginning to scurry around and make contingency plans in case the BOM really does return. In Nuland’s case, it is out of sight, out of mind, since the BOM has a short memory and bigger fish to fry. Vichy Mitch will knife everyone in the back until November and then relinquish “leadership” so someone else can be left holding the bag. They’re all banking on if the BOM returns, he will be forced to play with the same elements of the Uniparty and the Apparat that successfully hamstrung him in every way, large and small, the last time around. Considering that the BOM is profoundly incapable of going scorched earth, we will see a new round of Hawaiian judges, General Milleys, #Resistance, Mike Pences and the Gaystapo.All to a chorus of the Spiteful Mutants waving their dildoes around in the streets, Shitavious and Sasqueetchia rioting for “justice”, and Russia, Russia, Russia.Or they could all panic and do a fake and gay replay of 1860 and initiate civil war rather than submit to the Bad Orange Man and the potential threat he represents rather than the real one.

            While I still expect Trump to be incapacitated in some form or the other in coming months, there is a ripe opportunity if that does not happen for some Cromwell wannabe to be his chief of staff and go scorched earth. Steve Bannon had mild potential and thus was quickly removed the first time. A more sober and quieter type, though, could pull it off if connected enough.

                Since we are equating Bannon to historic figures, I posit him as Rasputin; repulsive yet powerful.
The man would starve without a patron, is obviously a severe alcoholic, and compulsively alienates potential allies. And yet, there he is, because this is an era of fanatics.

            The orange man had Mitch McConnell’s sister in law in the government. Angella Chao, a woman sitting on advisory boards to the Bank of China and whose entire fambly including McConnell’s wife is enmeshed in the CCP and in a particular faction of the CCP. The father was boyhood best friends with a major faction of the CCP.  This fambly is how McConnell got the name “Cocaine Mitch” (trafficking cocaine, of course)She was running a dept in the government under Trump. It has been speculated she was killed by the CCP and did not accidentally drive into a lake backwards in her Tesla.  All kinds of Chinese news sites reported on this death, falsely before any US news media, including local news media reported on it.  The Chinese outlets were reporting it was a 2 car collision where the other driver was arrested.The case is under criminal investigation right now.The swamp and the entanglement with the CCP is absolutely everywhere.  This is why Trump will never accomplish anything.You can get the basics on the story from this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwYsBonxuX8

                You’re thinking of Elaine Chao, not Angela. Elaine is Mitch’s wife. She was in Trump and Bush2’s Cabinets. They are sisters though. It seemed odd that she was killed? then soon after Mitch bailed on the Majority Leasder gig.

        Hrmmmmm. Well thought out.The only nit to pick is maybe your contention of fanaticism as a driver. I think I might disagree.Every single player in this debacle know EXACTLY what’s going on. They have to. Even pirates and buccaneers have to justify themselves to their superiors, and their word won’t cut it. When they say something is so, they have to prove it. They all know they are losing, and losing badly. General Milley slipped up once and accidentally revealed the truth. Even though he recanted, his treachery would never be forgiven. His only use to The Establishment was as a scapegoat and he knew it. Technically he is the first rat to flee the sinking ship. Vicky is the next. She’s going to try and put as much distance between herself and her role in this travesty as she can. Given the attention span of the public, she will probably succeed the way Miley did.The play now is to maintain the fiction that the Kraine is still a viable war. Of course Trump will scupper the Big Scam when he wins the election – and the spin from the Donks will be that the Bad Orange Man surrendered a war that was already all but won.Approximately 30% of the electorate will fall for it too. But…whadda I know…?

                Yeah, they’ll definitely try that. The problem is, these fools have set a snowball rolling down a hill and have no control over where it’s going.
A Russian victory will be seen by the world — and this includes both America’s enemies and allies — as an American defeat. The worst since Vietnam. There is nothing the US media will be able to do about that.
There will be repercussions for this and they will probably be more widespread than people realize.

        At some point, the bleeding of the American taxpayer will stop yielding results. Will we recognize in advance when it will happen? It appears that the pigs at the trough are seeking the corners in attempts to find the gruel. $34T and an additional $1T every 100 days… looks like a duck, walks like a duck… Let’s face it, the Republicans want war as much as the dems, so the apparent de-funding is obviously fake. The war was unlikely to collapse if the fraud could still drop its snout and yield $$$.Something smells off.

            The MIC likely has found a replacement in Africa or the Middle East that is more profitable and less likely to humiliate. It seems pretty apparent that the Afghanistan exodus only happened once the Ukraine project was greenlighted, so expect a similar retreat to a more “traditional” type of conflict that brings highly profitable democracy to Muslims and/or Africans.

                Leaders of the Superdetroit of Africa are apeaking out against the holocaust in Gaza. Just like that they boosted their country toward the top of the color revolution menu. So there’s that opportunity for the MIC to exploit if the diplomats decide to attack the sickest man of core BRICS. Expect them to accuse the ANC of betraying the happy dream of a rainbow nation. Perhaps also it will become fashionable to talk about the long war against European South Africans. It’s a wedge issue useful in domestic politics of North America, too. In any case, the Boer will be trained and armed to the teeth, and he will learn to die like Ukrainians.Meanwhile, the apparent loss in Ukraine is not so much of a loss for people who are willing to eat a brontosaurus one bite at a time. Sure, the Russians increased their territory, but they, too, have bled. The Ukrainian portion of the slav nation was shattered, and probaby there’ll be many more than 1/2 million dead, too, before it’s all over. A 33 year project comes to its conclusion by next winter. Toria is moving on to a new role teaching apprentices and advising journeymen in the dark arts of subverting political unions and consuming nations.

                    “Sure, the Russians increased their territory, but they, too, have bled.”Demography is far more important to the Russians than resources, with respect to acquisition. Their primary interest in territory is strategic depth, to give their anti-missile systems greater time to defeat threats aimed at their cities.The rate-limiting factor for Russian effort is manpower, not energy or other resources of which they already have an overabundance. Maybe they will have 60-70k dead when this war ends. They have already gained more than 7 million new white citizens, most of whom are grateful for liberation. They will gain many millions more when the redrawing of borders is finalized. Sure, they are also gaining access to massive amounts of new resources, but it is the people that are the most important thing. They have won an astounding victory.

            They will be forced into massive restructuring within the next 10 years. The nightmare scenario is a CBDC with a built-in UBI that will reach unprecedented levels of economic control. Honestly, I don’t think they can manage such a complex system anymore, so it will end up being massive inflation that will destroy what is left of the middle class while the rich ride the wave. Since the social spending is impossible to rein in, the cycle will just return in 20 years.
Then Krugman will still be there, telling us he’s never seen a better economy.

                    If the rurals want to send their raw products to the cities, the main points of processing and distribution, they’ll need to carry a convertible internal currency.

                        Reverse this. If the blue enclaves want to eat, or have access to other goods, maybe they’re the ones who have to come up with a store of value that their suppliers will accept in exchange for life saving goods.
Universally acceptable stores of value, such as gold, rubles, and similar are needed to equip the military of the red zones with good technology. Prudence dictates this.

Funniest working theory is she’s being recalled because her special skill set of Color Revolutions is going to be needed again in Washington come November.  The time to lay the groundwork is now.
She’s very, very good at it.

        Can’t wait for China to take over. The West needs a breather from ru(i)ning the world. The US (soon to be North Brazil) can stay in it’s own sphere of influence on the American continent, while Europe could use the opportunity to cleanse itself from undesirable elements. Israel will be forced to come to some sort of peaceful agreement with its neighbors (haha!).
The neocons can try their luck in China. They will likely become part of their local food chain and the world will be a better place.

Unfortunately, sir, you are incorrect.  Someone quite recently did exactly this:
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136234284-on-his-majesty-s-secret-service
Apparently the plot concerns 007 taking on a bunch of “English nationalists” trying to assassinate King Charles.  It’s a travesty that the executors of Ian Fleming’s estate insist on further sullying his reputation in print with hackery like this when the makers of the movies are quite capable of doing it all themselves.

        “The only reason the Republicans are stalling is they have the full support of the MIC on this.”I am ashamed to admit I had not thought of this previously but it almost certainly is correct. This likely also explains the departure of McConnell, who has used the State Department as a piggy bank to funnel money to his literally Oriental wife’s family. As some may recall, when Trump was elected he announced State would be cut to the bone. This was due to its active role in trying to undermine his campaign. McConnell vowed not one cent would be cut and, son of a bitch, it wasn’t.McConnell is being sacked to make way for a more MIC-compliant leader. While domestically there is no difference between him and. say, Thune, the latter is fully aligned with the MIC as Republicans traditionally are, and McConnell is a rainmaker for State as a way to enrich himself. DOD and its corporate affiliates avoid skirmishes with near peers because (a) pounding weak countries is more profitable and (b) focusing on the powerless does not expose what a pathetic paper tiger the United States is. Ukraine failed on both these fronts.As for Nuland, she is a bureaucratic survivor as well as a war criminal, and she sees the handwriting on the wall. She will slither off to a non-combat role now, either as a professor of international studies or to join her husband on the inflight magazine of the Regime, Foreign Affairs. After the MIC gets its beak wet somewhere in the Middle East or Africa. bringing democracy and Super Weapons to the freedom fighters du jour, she will gravitate back to State unless the intelligence folks are so butt hurt over the Ukraine debacle they decide it is time for Vikki to have either an unfortunate accident or be indicted for something or another.I do disagree on one point, though. The Forever War against Russia is drawing to a close as the sun sets on the GAE. Like the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, the Ukraine cluster simply was finishing as much business as possible before the GAE no longer is able to do so. The Palestinians may not be as lucky as the Russians, but that remains to be seen.

            Yeah, paper tiger for sure.  Notice how we’re no longer hearing about our vaunted navy blasting the Houthis’s and Yemeni’s out of their caves and destroying their ability to interdict red sea shipping – LOL.  In reality, they’re most likely trying desperately trying not to lose any ships themselves.
The news I’d like to see is Nuland “dying suddenly” of unknown causes, but I seriously doubt any of those turds ever took the magic covid juice jab.  She’ll scurry out somewhere else like the roach she is…

                The cliche of late is the Russians or Chinese sinking a carrier group with hypersonic missiles. The more likely scenario is Houthis boarding a ship and sodomizing the crew, with the worst aspect being that the latter is welcomed.

                The odds of something bad happening to you from the jab don’t appear to be that high. They’re just higher than they would be if you never got jabbed. This guy got jabbed 217 times in 3 years and he appears to be fine.

                    If the Beeb reported it, then it means we will see an escalating cascade of delayed aftereffects.  They’re getting in front of the story with this propaganda.
You are right, though, it wasn’t the killshot.Neither was AIDS.  VAIDS, what doesn’t kill you, simply leaves you wide open to everything else coming down the pike.
And if you want to get truly conspiratorial, the graphine oxide and sundry makes you a living transmitter.Can we say 5G and the Internet of Bodies?

        “The new guy will be given some latitude because the Republicans are this dumb.”A faction whose goal is to preserve, and whose greatest fear is subverting a document that has been so severely subverted so long ago just can’t withstand all out  war on all sides. This isn’t Alesia. It is some long forgotten skirmish where some tribe was surrounded on all sides and instead of picking up spears and axes they pointed to their stone tablets and frantically tried to persuade the spear and axe-wielding surrounding tribe to agree to the words. As they chiseled in a couple new letters they were slaughtered. The tablet was ground to dust and used as building materials for the aggressive tribe that lived on the offensive.In any case, the organization of the three factions and the time horizon of the anti-Russians were pieces of information that are valuable and important to ponder.

            Mike Tre: “The term “neocon” is used 9 times by my count.”Z: “That leaves the foreign policy establishment, which remains committed to the project for ethnic and ideological reasons… Nuland… is a fanatic and fanatics see only that which supports their fanaticism.”===============It’s such a shame that at this late stage in The Game, we still have to speak in code words, with hushed voices.What is the ethnicity? What is its ideology? What is the source of its fanaticism?And do Normies even notice any of this sh!znat?Or are Normies still struggling to grok the nihilistic cynicism of shrinkflation?Apparently Tater Joe [G0d bless his little incestuous potato heart] Tater Joe only learned about shrinkflation a couple of days ago.
