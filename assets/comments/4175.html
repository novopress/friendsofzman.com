        Good analysis, Z. Obama and his JV team will make the world safe for democracy! Or despots. Or fascists. Something completely unpleasant, anyway. And just like Urkel from Family Matters, he’ll walk away from the whole disaster, “Did I do that?”

        UKer,
Who needs to care what Iran or any of them do.  We should not need to appease them, we should just leave.
That is of course unless you believe they could build huge navies, let alone competently run them and sale to New York or London.

        When Chamberlain came back from Munich and boldly waved the autograph of Herr Hitler, the case for appeasement was about as good as it got. Subsequent events proved that the signature wasn’t worth the trip.But, as history is not a subject studied by the elite, it always comes as a surprise to them that the current round of appeasement isn’t going to work. Oddly, these great and good leaders may devour fictions such as Lord Of The Rings where appeasement is the last thing on the cards and survival everything, but they think real life is different.That is what I think is happening in the Middle east. All sorts of supposed intelligent people think that by appeasing the likes of Iran and the blood-thirsty hordes brandishing AK-47s, these people will somehow love them and appreciate how modern they are.But Iran and ISIS and all the rest are the orcs of modern life, bringing their ugly version of hell from the pit they dwelt in.“Come friendly orcs and fall on our soft bellies, it isn’t fit for civilised westerners now” to vaguely paraphrase Betjeman. But they fall with heavy boots and the appeasers are soon wailing that it was all someone else’s fault.

        I think that the elites want to ally with Iran, and by extension, Shia Islam because the Shia world has a hierarchy, a center, someone (they think) that they can pick up the phone and call and get results.  Sunni Islam confounds them due to its tribal, networked nature.  They are tired of trying to come to an agreement with Proteus in a turban.  I think that they are willing to turn Al Shams and Iraq over the the Persians to create some sort of illusory stability in the region.  One could spend an evening with a good cigar contemplating the ironies of hard-core anti-colonialists like the current bunch striving to set up a neo-colonialist Persian Empire in the heart of the Dar al Arab.I was listening to the weekly CFR podcast the other day (well someone has to).  The “executive agreement” with Iraq was of course being discussed.  The hosts, after spending ten minutes of gingerly talking around the Constitution, finally concluded that the executive agreement would be on shaky legal groundwithout ever once quoting or paraphrasing, “He [the President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.”We are teh fuxored.

        “I think that’s part of what we are seeing in the MENA. The people calling the shots are completely wrong and completely certain.”
In two administrations.  The only policy ever to make sense would be to leave all of the MENA and never return.  Also, leaving Europe and Asia would be a step toward healing.

        This has such potential to be utterly catastrophic that it’s astonishing to me that people refuse to even consider the implications of it. A generation hooked on Facebook and whatever as their bread and circuses will likely sit in oblivious bliss as the nukes start flying.Malcolm Muggeridge wrote an allegory about entertainment where people would sit in a theatre watching increasingly sensational acts. When the manager comes out and tells them the theatre is on fire they think it’s part of the show and sit there and burn to death.

        The missing piece in the “why Iran” puzzle is Valerie Jarrett, Obama’s seeming mommy figure. She’s from Iran (i.e., born there).Other than that, I think the overarching plan is to make sure that the evil US can never again be accepted as a serious dealer on the world stage. It is amusing, however, to see the Europeans, long used to playing good cop against the US’s bad cop suddenly having to act like adults. Sort of.

        The progressive mind removes the slim distinction between malice and incompetence because they are so invested in both. The best hope for the least disaster in the ME is the unspoken alliance between Israel and the Sunni powers, growing stronger with the absence of US presence. But the US malcompetence may beat them to it.

        Progressives aren’t as crazy as they seem. Progressivism is a mind virus, and it’s not important that it work so much as it weakens the host so that no other system can function. A little infection goes a long way.The progressives’ holy grail in this case is progressive Islam. I think they think if they can create progressive Islam, it will take over all the Islamic countries and give them control. If you believe David Goldman/Spengler, Iran is a seriously sexually dysfunctional/promiscuous country with a low birthrate, which makes it functionally progressive. It’s an oligarchy run partly by business men and partly by clerics, which is progressive, even if Shia Islam isn’t obviously so.Valerie Jarrett grew up there, and her affection for it must be partly anti-American, but could also be that the system and society are compatible with her and Obama’s goals and beliefs.

            I don’t know. The American foreign policy elite have an uncanny habit of getting things completely wrong. In the Reagan years, all the smart people said he was nuts and that the Soviets were reforming and becoming more powerful. Right up to the collapse they were talking about a resurgent Soviet Union.I think that’s part of what we are seeing in the MENA. The people calling the shots are completely wrong and completely certain. As a result they have been blind to the long simmering conflicts with Islam and within the MENA. It’s not just the religious stuff; it is the secular stuff too.That said, Obama seems to be completely controlled by Valerie Jarrett, who has some very strange ideas about foreign policy. She is the Rasputin of this administration. He fondness for Iran appears to be based on nothing by memories of her youth.
